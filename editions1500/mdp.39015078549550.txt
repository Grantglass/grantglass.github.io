E O B I NSON CR0S OE.
I Was born at York, in the year 1632, of a re-
putable family. My father was a native of Bre*
inen, who, by raerchandistng at Hull for some time,
gained'a very plentiful fortune. He married*my
mother at York, who received her first,breath1 in
that country; and as her maiden name wa;s R.obaif
son/ I was called Kobin/on Krentznaer, which not
being easily pronounced in the English tongue, we
-are commonly known by the name of Crusoe*
I was the youngest of three brothers. The eld-
- est was a lieutenant-colonel in Lockhart's regiment,
hut slain by the Spaniards z what became of the
other, I-could never learn. ^
No charge nor pains were wanting in myeduca*
tion. My father deigned me for the law; yetjio-
tliiqg w.ould serve me but 1 must go to sea, both a-
-gainstthe will of my father, the tears of my mother,,
and, the intreaties.of friends. One morning my fa-
ther expostulated very warmly with me: What rear
son, fays he^ have you to leave your native country*
where there must be a more certain prospect o£con-
tent and happiness,' toenter into a wandering coi\-
jl: * * A • „ " * ditiofi
dition of uneasiness and uncertainty? He recom-
mended to me Agur's wish, Neither to desire poverty
nor riches; that a middle state of life was the most
happy; and that the high towering thoughts of rai-
ling our condition by wandering abroad, were fur*
rounded with misery and danger, and. often ended
with confusion and disappointment. I intreat you,
nay, I command'you, (says he,) to desist from these in-*
tentions. Consider your eldest brother, who laid
down his life for his honour, or rather lost it for
his disobedience to my will. If you will go, (add&d
lie,) my prayers shall however be offered for your
preservation; but a time may come, when, desolate,
oppressed, or forsaken, you may wish you had taken
'your poor despised father's counsel.* He pro-
nounced these words with such a moving and patera
nal eloquence, while floods of tears ran down his
aged cheeks, that it seemed to stem the torrent of
my resolutions. But this soon wore off, and a little
after I informed my mother, that I could not settle
to any business, my resolutions were so strong to
see the world; and begged me would gain my fa-
ther's consent oriiy to go one voyage; which, if it
did nqt prove prosperous^ I would never attempt
a second. But my desire was as vain as my folly
in asking. My mother passionately expressed her
dislike of this proposal, telling me, That as floe saw*
J was bent upon my own destruction, contrary to their
will and my duty, floe would fay no more, but leave
?ne to trtyself to do whatsoever I pleased.
I was thennI think, nineteen years old, when one
titne being at Hull, I met a school-fellow of mine
going along with his father, who was master of a ship,
toLdndon; and acquainting himwithmy wandering
desires, he assured me of a free pajssage, and a plenti-
ful share of what was necessary. Thus, without im-
ploring a blessing, or taking farewell of my parents,
1 took ihipping on the first of September 1651. We-
* sec
set sail soon after; and our Jhip had scarce left the
Humber astern, when there arose so violent a storm,
that, being extremely sea-lick, I concluded the judg-
ments of God deservedly followed me for ray dis-
obedience to my dear parents* It was then I called
to mind the good advice of my father; how easy
and comfortable was a middle state of life; and I
firmly resolved, if it pleased God to set me on dry
land once more, I would return to my parents
implore their forgivenness, and bid a final adieu to
my wandering inclinations.
Such were my thoughts while thestorm continued?
but these good resolutions decreased with the danger;
more especially when my companion came to mef"
clapping me on-the shoulder: What, Bob I said hey>
sure you was.not frightened last night with scarce a
capful of "win d?—An ddoy ou, cf i ed I, call such a vio~
(en t storm a capfull of wind? A storm, youfoctlyotii
said he, this is nothing: a good/hip and sea-room al-
ways bafjlesjuch a foolishsquall of wind ay that: But
you're a fresto water-sailor: Come, boy, turn out,fee
what fine weather we have now, and a good bowtof
punch wilt drown all your past sorrows. In short, the
punch was made, I was drunk, and in one night's
time drownedboth my repentance and my good re-"
solutions, forgetting entirely the vows and promises
1 made in my distress: and whenever any reflec-
tions would return on me, what by company, and
what by drinking, I soon mastered those fits, as I
deridingly called them. But this only made way
for another trials whereby I could not but fee how-
much I was beholden to kind providence.
Upon the sixth day we came to an anchor in Har-
, wichroad, where welay wind-bound with some New-
castle ships; ancl therebeing good anchorage^ and
our cables found, the seamen forgot their late toil
and danger, and spent the time as merry as if they
had been on shore. But on the. eighth day there
, A 2 arose »
arose a brisk gale of'wind* which prevented our ti»
ding it up the river; and still increasing, our ship
rode forecastle in, and shipped several large seas.
It was not long hefore horror seized the seamen
themselves, and I heard the Master express this me-
lancholy ejaculation, Lordhave mercy upon us^weshall
be all lost and undone! For my part, sick unto death,
I kept my cabin,.till the universal and terribly dread*
ful? apprehensions of our speedy fate made me get
upon deck s and there I was affrighted indeed. The
sea went mountains high: I could fee nothing but
distress around us; two ships had cut their masts on
boaa'd, and another was foundered; two more that
had lost their anchors, were forced out to the mercy
of the oceaa; and, to save our lives, we were for-
ced' to cut our foremast and main-mast quite away,
. Who is there so ignorant as not to judge of my
dreadful condition! I was but a fresh-water sailor^
and therefore it seemed more terrible. Our ship
was very good, but over-loaded; which made the sail-
ors often cry out, She would founder: Words I then
was ignorant of. All this while the storm continu-
ing, and rather increasing, the master and the more
sober-part of hismen went toprayers, expecting death
*' every moment- In the middle of the night one cried
out, JVe had sprung a leak: Mother That there was
four foot water in the hold* \ I .was just ready to ex-
pire with fear, when immediately all hands were cal-
led to, the pump; and the men forced me alfa in that
extremity td share with them in their labour. While
thus employed,themaster efpyingfbnielight colliers'
fired a gun as a signal of distress; and I not under*
standing what it meant, and thinking that either the
Jhip broke, or some dreadful thing happened, fell
into a swoon. Even in that common condition of
woe, nobody minded me, excepting to thrust me a-
tide with their feet, thinking me deadj and it was
u £reat while before, I recovered.
Happy
Happy it was for us, when, ^upon the signal given,
they ventured out their boat to save our lives. All
our pumping had been in vain, and vain had all our
attempts been, had they not come to our ship's side,
and our men cast them a rope over the stern with a
buoy to it, which after great labour they got hold
of, and we haling them to us, got into their boaty
and left our (hip, which we perceived sink within less-
than a quarter of an hour; and thus I learned what
was meant by Foundering at sea. .And now th|r
men incessantly laboured to recover their own ship;
but the sea ran fe high, and the wind blew so hard, that
they thought it convenient to hale within shore;,
which, with great difficulty and danger, at'last we
happily effected, landing at a place called Cromer, riot
far from Winterton lighthouse; from whence we
all walked to Yarmouth, where, as objects of pity^
many good people furniihed us wkh necessaries to
carry us either to Hull or London
Strange, that after all this, like the prodigal fon^
I did not return to my father; who, hearing of the
ship's, calamity, for a long time thought me intomb-
ed in the^deep. No doubt but I Ihould have'pared
in his fatted calf as the scripture expresseth it 5
but my ill fate still pushed trie on, in spite of the
powerful convictions of reason and conscience.
When we had been at Yarmouth three daysy Imet
my old companion, who had given me the invitation
to go on board along with his father. His behavi-,
ourandspeechwas altered^and ina melancholy man-*,
ner asked me how I did, telling his father who I wasr
and how I had made this voyage for a trial only to/
proceed farther abroad. Upon which the old gentle-
man turning to toe gravely, said, Youngman, you ought
never to go lo fe a anymore, but t<y4ake this for aceriahv
sign, thatyouvjlllne*erprosper ina/eafartng condition.
Sir i answered 1^ willy ovt* take the fanje resolution ? It]
h a different cafe^ said he, if is my callings and con/e*
, A j" qutntty
quently my duty ; but as you havemade thisvoyage for
a trial, you'fee whM ill success heaven basset before
your eyes; 'and perhaps our miseries have been on
,your account, like Jonah in the flip of Tarshifli.
But pray what are you, and on what account did you
g<r to sea? Upon which I very freely declared my
whole story; at the end of which he made this ex-
clamation. Yesacredpowers! whathadlcommitted,
that such a wretch should enter into my ship* to heap
upon me such a deluge of miseries! But soon recol-
lecting his passions, Young man,MA he, if you do not
go back, depend upon it, where-ever you go, you will'
meet with disasters and disappointments till your fa-
ther'swords are fulfilled upon yoji. And so we partedv
I thought at first to retumhome; but sliame op-
posed tliat good motion, asthinkinglsliouldbe laugh-
ed at by my neighbours andacquaintance. So strange .
is the nature of youth, who are not ashamed to fin,
but yet ashamed to repent; and so far from*being a-
shamed of those actions for which they may be ac-
counted fools,, they think it folly toreturn to their-
duty, which is the principal mark of wisdom. la*
fhor trItrav elled up to London, resolving uporra voy-
age; anda voyage I soon heard of,by my acquaintance
with a captain who took a fancy to me, to goto the
coast of Guinea. Havingsome money, and appearing
like ^gentleman, I went on board, not as a common
* sailor or foremast-man;, nay, the Commander a-
greed I should-go that voyage with him without any-
expense; that I should be his mess-mate and eoni-'
panion, and I was very welcome to carry any thing-
with me, and make the best merchandise I could..
I blessed my happy fortune, and humbly thanked:
Hiy captain for this offer; and acquainting my friends
in Yorkshire, forty pounds were sent me^hegveatest'
part of which my dear father and mother contri-
buted to, with which I bought toys and trifles, as the
captain directed me. My captain also taught me navi*
. - gationr
-gation, how'to•'keep an account of the slitp's course,
take an observation, aud led me \hto the knowledge
of several useful branches of the mathematics. And
indeed this voyage made me both a sailor and a mer-
chant; for I brought home five pounds nine ounces
of gold dust for my adventure, which produced, at
my return to London, almost three hundred pounds.
But in this voyage I was extremely sick, being thrown
into a violent calenture through excessive heat, tra-
ding upon the coast from the latitude of fifteen de- *
grees north even to-the line itself.
'But alas! my dear friend the captain soon departed
this life after his arrival. This was ti sensible grief
to me; yet Tresolved to go another voyage with his*
mate, who had now got command of the ship. This
proved a very unsuccessful one; for thoughl didnot
carry quite a hundred pounds of my late acquired-
wealth, (so that I had two hundred pounds left, Which
I reposed with the captain's widow who was an ho-
nest gentlewoman,) yet my misfortunes in this un-
happy voyage were v£ry great. For our (hip failing
towards the Canary islands, we were* chased by a?
Salee rover 5 and in spite of all the haste we cduld
make, bycrouding as much canvas as our yards could,
spread, or ourmastscarry^ the pirate gained upon us,
fothat we prepared ourselves to fight. They had eigh<-
teen guns, and we hadbut twelve. About three in- the1
afternoon there was a desperate engagements where-
in many \vere killed and wounded on both sides: but.
finding ourselves overpowered with numbers, our''
ship disabled, and ourselves too impotent to have the:
seaQ: hopes of success, we were forced to surrender j
and accordingly were all carried prisonersinto the
portofSallee. Ourmen weresent tathe Emperor's .
court to be fold there; but the pirate captaki taking'
notice of me, kept me to be hifc own slave.:
'In this condition,! thought myself the most misers
able creature oaeartR, and the prophecy of ray father
** * game
came afresti into my thoughts. However, my condi-
tion was better than I thought it to be, as will soon
appear. Some hopes indeed I had that my new pa*
tron would go to sea again, where he niight be taken
by a Spanish or Portuguese man of war, and then I
should be set at liberty. But in this I was mistaken ^
for he never took me with him, but left me to look
after his little garden, and do the drudgery of his
house, and when he returned from sea, would make
me lye in the cabin, and look after the ship. I had
no one that I could communicate my thoughts tof
which were continually meditating my escape; no
Englishman, Irishman, or Scotsman here but my-
self; and for two years I could fee nothing practi-
cable, but only pleased myself with the imagination*
Af^er some length of time, my patron, as I founds
grew so poor, that he could not fit out his {hip as u?
iual: and then he used constantly, once or.twicea-
week, if the weather was fair, to go out a-fiihing>
taking me and a youngMoresco boy to row theboat *
and so much pleased was he with me for my dexte*
rity in catching the fish, that he would often fend
- me with a Moor, who was one of his kinsmen, and
the Moresco youth, to catch a dish of fish for him*
One morning as we were at the sport, therearose
such a thick fog, that we lost sight of the shore: and
rowing we knew not which way, we labouredall the
night, and in the morning found ourselves in the
ocean, two leagues from land. Howeverrwe attain-
ed there at length, and made the greater haste, beh
cause our stomachs were exceeding sharp and hun-
gry. Inorder taprevent such disasters for thefuture^
my patron ordered a carpenter to buiida little state-
Toom or cabbin in the middle of the long-boat,>with-
a place behind it to steer and hale home themaia
slieet, with other conveniences to keep him from,
the weather, as also lockers to put in all manner-
of provisions, with a handsome slioulder-of-muttpa:
fail,, gibing over the cabin..
.' In this he frequently took us out a-fifhing; and
one time inviting two or three persons of distinction
togd withhim,made provisions extraordinary,provi-
ding alsothr'ee fusees with powder and (hot, that they
might have some sport at fowling along the sea-coast.
The next morning,the boat was made clean, her an-
cient and pendants out, and every thing ready? but
their minds altering, ray patron ordered us to go
a~sisliing for that his guestsswould certainly sup with
him that night. •.'..-
r And now I began to think of my deliverance in-
deed. In order to this I persuaded the moor to get
some provisions on board, as not daring to meddle
with our patron's; and he taking,my advice, we sto-
red ourselves with rusk biscuit, and three jars of wa-
ter. Besides, I privately conveyed into the boat a
bottle of brandy, some twine, thread, a hammer, hafr
chet, and a saw; and in particular some bees-wax,
which was a great comfort to me, andfervedto make
candles. I then persuaded Muley(for so was the moor-
called) to procure some powder and shot, pretending,
to kill sea-curlieus, which he innocently and readily
agreed te. In short, being provided with all things
jiecessary, we sailed out/ resolving for my own part
to make my escape tho* it should cost me my life.
When we had passed the castle, wetfell tb fishing;
but tho' I knew there was a bite, I dissembled the
matter, in order tb put further out to sea. Accord-
ingly we ran a league further; -When giving the boy
the hem, and pretending to stoop for something, I
seized Milley by surprise, arid threw hitri overboard*
"As he was an excellent swimmer, he soon arose^ and
made towards the'boat ^ upon which I took out a
fusee, and presented it at him: Muley, said I, I never
yet designed to do youdny harm, and seek nothing noi^j'"
hut my redemption. I know you are able enough to swim
to shore, and save you? life*; hut if you are resolved to
follow me fQ the endangering ofntinfy the very ma~
 *i*''  tnent
menf you proceed I will Jhoot you through, the head.
Theharml ess creature, at these words, turned himself
from me, and I makeno doubt got safe to land. Then
turning to the boy Xury, I perceived he trembled at
the action j but-1 put him out of all fear, telling him,
that if he would be true and faithful to me, I would
*lo well by him. And therefore, said I, you muststroke
your face to be faithful, and, as the Turks have learned
you, swear by Mahomet, and the heard of your fa*
ther, or else J will throw you into the sea also. So^
innocent qid the child then look, and with such an
obliging smile consented,' that I readily believed
him, and from that day forward began to love him
entirely.
We then pursued our voyage; andlestthey should
think me gone to the Streight's mouth, I kept to
the Southward to the truly Barbarian coast: but
in the dusk of the evening I changed my course*
and steered directly S. and by E. that J might keep-
near the shore; and having a fresh gale of wind,
with a pleasant smooth sea, by three o'clock next
day I was 150 miles beyond the Emperor of Mo-
rocco's dominions. Yet still having the dreadful
apprehension of being retaken,, I continued sailing
for five days successively, till such time as the wind
shifting to the southward, made me conclude, that
if any vessel was in'thace of me, they would pro*
ceed no further. After so much fatigue and
thought, I anchored at the mouth of a. little river,
I knew not what, or where: neither did I thea
see any people. What. I principally wanted was-
fresh water; and I was resolved about the dusk to
swim ashore. But no sooner did the gloomy clouds
of night begin to succeed the declining day, when
we heard such barking, roaring, and howling of
wild creatures, that one might have thought the
very strangest monsters of nature* or infernal spi-
ritSj had their residence there. Poor Xury, al-
most
most dead with fear, intreated me not to go on
shore that*night. Supposing I don't, Xury,' said I,
and in the morning we should see men who are worse
than those we fear, what then? 0 den we may give
dent de Jhoot.gun, replied Xury laughing, and de~
gun make dem all run away. The wit, and Broken
English which the boy had learned among the cap-*
tives of* our nation, pleased me entirely; and to
add to his chearfulness, I gave him a dram of the
bottle: we could get but little sleep all the night
for those terrible howjings they made; and indeed
we were both very much affrighted, when, by the
rollings of the water, and other tokens, we justly
concluded one of those monsters made towards our
boat. I could not fee it till it came within two
oars length, when taking my fusee, I let fly at
him. Whether I hit him or no, I cannot tell j but
he made towards the shore, and the noise of my
gun increased the stupendous noise of the. mon-
sters. - -
The next morning I was resolved to go on sliore
to get fresh water, and venture my life among the
beasts or savages, should either attack me. Xury
fidd, he would take one of the jars, and bring me
some. I asked him why he would go, and not I?
The poor boy answered, If wild mans come, they
tat me, you go way. A mind scarcely now to be
imitated, so contrary- to self-preservation, the
most powerful law of nature! This indeed increas-
ed my affection to the child. Well, dear Xury, said
I, we will both go ashore, • both kill wild mans,* and
they fall eat neither of us. So giving Xury a piece
of rusk bread to eat, and a dram, we waded a-
shore, carrying nothing with us but our^arms, and
two jars, for water. ,1 did not go out'of light'of
the boat, as dreading the savages coming down the
river in their canoes: but the boy seeing a low
descent or vale about a mile in the country, he
wandered
wandered to it; and then running back to me with
great precipitation, I thought h€ was pursued by
some savage or wild beast; upon which I approach^
ed, resolving to perish or protect him from danger.
As he came nearer to me, I saw something hang-
ing over*his shoulders, which wal a creature he
had shot like a hare, but different in colour, and
longer legs; however, we were glad of it, for it
proved wholesome andjnourifhing meat; but what
added to our joy was, my boy assured me there
was plenty of water, and thathe fee no wild mans*
And greater still was our comfort,-when we found
fresh water in the creek where we were when the
tide was out, without going so far up into the
country.
In this place I began to consider that the Cana-
ry and Cape de Verde islands lay not far off; but
having no instrument, I knew not what latitude,
or when to stand off to sea for them; yet my hopes
were, I should meet some of the English trading .
vessels, who would relieve and take us in.
The place I was in was no doubt that wild coun^
try, inhabited only by a few, that lyes between
the Emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Ne-
grcfes. It is filled with wild beasts, and the Moors
use it for hunting chiefly. From this place I
thought I saw the top of the mountain Teneriffe
in the Canaries; which made me try twice to at-?
tain it; but as often was I drove back, and so fort
ced to pursue my fortune along shore.
Early one morning we came to an anchor un-
der a little point of land, but pretty high; and
the tide beginning to flow, we lay ready to go
further in, but Xury, whose youthful and pene-
trating eyes were sharper than mine, in a soft tone,
desired me to keep far from land, lest we should
be devoured,: For look yonder, may ter, said he, and
fee de dreadful monster fast a steep on de side ofde
hill. Accordingly looking where he pointed, I
efpiedra fearful monster indeed. It was a terrible
gre^at lion that lay on shore, covered as it were
by a shade of a piece of the hill. Xury, said I,
you Jhall go on foore and kill him. But the boy
looked amazed; Me kill hint, fays he, he eat me
at one mouth; meaning one mouthful. Upon which
I bid him lye still, and charging my biggest gun
with two slugs, and a good charge of powder, I
took the best aim I could to shoot him through
the head; but his leg lying over-his nose, the Aug
broke his knee bone. The, lion awaking with the
pain, got up, but soon fell down* giving the most
hideous groan I ever heard; but taking my second
piece, I shot him through the head, and then he
lay.struggling for life. Upon this Xury took hearts
and desired my leave to go on. sliore. Go then,
fi'ad I. Upon which taking a little gun in one hand,
he swam to sliore with the othert and coming close
to the lion, put, a period to his life, by shooting
him again through the head.
But this was spending our ammunition in vain,
the flesh, not hdng good/to eat. Xury was like
a champion, and comes on board for a hatchet, to
cm off the head of his enemy; but* not having;
•strength to perform it, he cut off and brought
..me a foot. I bethought me however that his
skin would be of use. .This work cost Xury and
me a whole day; when spreading it -on the top
of our cabin, the hoc beams of the fun -effectually
dried itt in two clays timey and it afterwards served
me "for a bed to lye on. ~
And how we sailed southerly, living sparingly
on our provisions, and went "no oftener on ihore
;than we were obliged for fresh water. My de-
sign was to make the river Gambia or Senfegalvx>4*
•any where about the Cape de Verde, in hopes to
iineet some European slYip. If Providence ididinot;
so favour me, my next course was to seek for the
islands, or lose my life among the negroes. And
in a word, I put my whole stress upon this; " Ei-
"that I must meet with some ship, or certainly
"perish."
One day as we were sailing along, We saw peo-
ple stand on thelhore looking at us; we could'al-
so perceive they were black, and stark naked. I
was inclined to go on shore: but Xury cried. No,
no; however I approached nearer, and I found
they run,along the shore by me a good way. They
had no weapons in their hands, except one, who
held a long stick, which Xury told me was a lance
with which they could kill at a great distance. I
talked to them by signs, and made them sensible I
wanted something to eat; they beckoned to me to
stop my boat, while two of them ran up into the
country, and in less than half an hour came back,
and brought with- them two pieces of dry flesh,
and some corn, which we "kindly accepted: and to
prevent any fears on either side, they brought the
food to the shore, laid it <iown, then went and
stood a great way off till we fetched it on board,
and then came closs to us again.
But while we were returning thanks to them,
being all we could afford, two mighty creatures
came from the mountains, one as it were pursuing
the other with great fury, which we were the ra-
ther inclined to believe*, as they seldom appear
but in the night; and both these swiftly passing by
the negroes jumped into the sea, wantonly swim-
ming about, as though the diversion of the waters
had put a stop to their fierceness. At last one of
them coming nearer to my boat than I expected
or desired, I shot him directly through the head;
upon which he funk immediately, yet rising again,
would have willingly made to the shore; but be-
tween the wound and the strangling of the water,
he died before he could reach it.
• It is impossible to express the consternation the
poor negroes were in at the firing of my gun;
much less can I mention their surprise, when they
perceived the creature to be slain by it. I made
signs to them to draw near it with a rope, and
then gave it to them to hale on shore. It \vas a
beautiful leopard which made me desire its skin;
and the negroes seeming to covet the carcase, I
freely gave it to them. As for the other leopard,
it made to shore, and ran with a prodigious swift-
ness out of sight. The negroes having kindly fur-
nished me with water, and with what roots and
grains their country afforded, I took my leave,
and, after eleven days,fail, came insight of the
Cape deYerde, and those islands called by its name.
But, the great .distance I, wa3 from it, and fearing
contrary winds would prevent my reaching them,
I began to grow melancholy and dejected, when
upon a sudden Xury cried out, Master, master, a
Jhip with a sail! and looked as affrighted as if it
was his master's sliip sent in search of us. But I
soon discovered she was a Portugueze sliip^ as I
thought bound to the coast of Guinea for negroes.
Upon which I strove for life to come up to them* s
But vain had it been, if through their perspective
glasses they had not perceived me; and shortened
their fail to let me come up. Encouraged at this,*
1 set up my patron's ancient, and fired a gun, both
as signals of distress j upon which they very kindly
lay to, so that in three hours-time I £ameup with
them. They spoke to me in Portugueze, Spanisli,
and French, but neither of these did I understand;
till at length a Scots sailor called, and then I told
him I was an Englishman, who had escaped from/
the Moors at Sallee; upon which they took me kind-
ly on board with all my effects.
Surely none can express the inconceivable joy
I felt at this happy deliverance! who, from being.

a late*miserable and forlorn creature, was not on-
ly relieved, but in favour-with the master of the
k ship, to whom, in return for my deliverance, 1 offer-

only taking aivzy a life I have given. My chari*
ty teaches me better* Those efsttfs you have will
stipportyou there, and provide you. a passage home
again. And indeed he acted with the strictest jus-
tice in what he idid, taking my things into his pas*
session, and giving me an exact inventory even to
my earthen jars, He bought my boat of me for
the ship's use, giving me a note of eighty pieces of
eight, payable at Brazil; and if any body offered
more, he would make it up. He also gave me sixty
pieces for im boy Xury* It was with great reluc-
tance I was prevailed upon to fell the child's liber-
ty, who had served me ib faithfully; but the boy
was willing himself; and it was agreed, that after
ten years he should bd made free, upon his renoun-
cing Mahometisnx, and embracing Christianity,
Having a pleasing voyage to the Erazils, we ar-
rived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All-Saints
Pay, in twenty-two days after. And here I can-
not forget the generous treatment of the captain;
He would take nothing for my passage, gave me
twenty ducats for the leopard's stein, and thirty ftSr
the lion's. Every thmghe caused to be deliver-*
edv and what I would sell he bought. In short,
I mnde about 220 pieces of my cargo.; and with
this stock I entered once more, as I may fey, into
the scene cf life.
, Being
Being recommended to an horiestplariter, I lived
with him till such time as I was informed of the
manner of their planting and making sugars and
seeing how well they lived, and how suddenly they
grew rich, I was filled with a desire to settle a-
mong them, and resolved to get my money remit-
ted to me, and to purchase a plantation.
To be brief, I baught a settlement next door to ait:
honest and kind neighbour, born at Lisbon, ©f Eng-
lish parents,- whose plantation joining to mine, we
improved very amicably together. Both our stocks
were low, and for two years we planted only for
food: but the third year we planted some tobacco,
and each of u$ dressed a large piece of ground the
ensuing year for planting canes. But now I found-
how much I wanted assistance^ and repented the-'
loss of my dear boy Xurj*v
Having noite to assist me, my father's words^
came into my mind; and I used *to ask myself, If
what I sought was only a middle station of life, why
could it net as well be obtained in England as here?
When I pondered on this with regret, the thoughts
of my late deliverance' forsook me. I had none to
converse with but- my neighbour; no work to be
done but by my own hands; it often made me sayv
my condition was like^ to that of a man cast upon
a desolate island. So unhappy are we in our re*
fle'ctions, so forgetful of what good things nve re-
ceive ourselves, and so unthankful for our deli-
verance from those calamities that others endure.
I was in some measure'settled, before the cap-
tain, who* took me up, departed from the Brasils.
One day I went to him, and told him what stoclc
I had in London, j desiring his assistance in getting
it remitted; to which the good gentleman readily
consented, but would only have me send for half
my money, lest it should miscarry 5 which if it did,
I might still have the remainder to support me:
, B 3 . an&
and so taking letters of procuration from me, bid
me trouble myself no farther about it.
And indeed vvonderful was his kindness towards
me; for he not only procured the money I had
drawn for upon my Captain's widow, but sent-me
over a servant with a cargo, proportionable to
my condition. He also sent me over tobls of all
forts, iron work, and utensils necessary for my
plantation, and which proved of the greatest use
to me in my business.
Wealth now accumulating on me, and uncom-
mon success crowning my prosperous labours, I
might have rested happy in that middle state of
life my father had so often recommended; yet no*
thing w6uld content me, such, was my. evil geniust
but I nlust leave this happy station, for a foolish
ambition in rising: and thus, once more, I cast
myself" into the deepest gulf of misery that ever
a poor creature self into. Having lived four year9
in BrasilT I had npt only learned the language,
but contracted acquaintance with the most eminent
planters, and even the merchants of St. Salvadore j
to whom, once, by way of discourse, having given
an account of my two voyages to the coast of
Guinea, and the manner of trading there for merer,
trifles, by which we furnish our plantations with
negroes^ they gave such attention to what I saidr
that three of them came one .morning to me, and
told me th£y had a secret proposal*to make. Af-
ter injoining me to seqrecy, (it being an infringe
ment tin the powers of the kings of Portugal and
Spain,) they told me they had a mind to Et out a
ship to go to Guinea, in order to stock the plan-
tation with negroes, which, as they could not be
publicly fold, they would divide among themr and
if I would go their supercargo in the lhip^ to ma-
nage the trading part,. I ihould have an equal share
of the negroes, without providing any stock. The:.
thing
thing indeed was fair enough, had I been in ano- .
ther condition. But I, born to be my own de-
stroyer, could not resist the proposal, but accept
ted the offer, upon condition of their looking af-
ter my plantation. So maMng a formal will, I
bequeathed my effects to my good friend the cap-
tain, as my universal heir j but obliged him to dis-
pose of my effects as directed, one half of the pro-
duce to himself, and the other to be s shipped to
England. . > . ^ , '. - • . v
The ship being fitted out, and all things readyt
we set sail on the first of September 1659, being
the fame day eighth year I left my father and mo-
ther in Yorkshire* We sailed northward upon the
coast, in -order to gain Africa, till we made Cape
Augustine; from whence, going farther in the
ocean, out of sight of lands we steered as though
we were bound for the isle Fernand de Norenba,
leaving the islands on the east; and then it was we
met with a terrible tempest, which continued for
twelve days successively ^ so that the winds carried
us wheresoever they pleased. In this perplexity,
one of our men died, and one man and a boy were
washed over board.: When the weather cleared
up a little, we found ourselves eleven degrees*
north latitude, upon the coast of Guinea. Upon
this the captain gave reasons for returning; which
I opposed, counselling him to. stand away for.Bar-
.badoes, which,, as I supposed, might be attained
in fifteen days. So altering our course, we sailed
north-west and by west, in order to .reach the leer
ward islands; but a second storm succeeding, drove
us to the westward; so that we were justly afraid
of falling into the hands of cruel -savages, or the
paws of devouring beasts of prey.
In this great distress, one of our men, early in
the morning, cried out, Lairds lani\ which he had -
no sooner cried out, hut our ship struck upon a
sand/
sand, and in a moment the sea broke over her iit
such a manner, that we expected we should all have
perished immediately. We knew nothing where
we were, or upon what land we were driven;
whether an island or the main, inhabited or not
inhabited; and we could riot so much as hope that
the ship would hold out many minutes, without
breaking in pieces, except the wind by a miracle
should; turn about immediately. While we stood
locking at one another, expecting death every mo-
ment, the mate lays hold of the boat, and with
the help of the rest got her flung over the fhip'a
fide, and getting all into her, being eleven of usy
committed ourselves tq God's mercy, and the,wild
sea. And now we saw that this last effort would
not be a sufficient protection from deaths so high did
the sea rise, that it was impossible the boat ihould
live. As to making fail, we had none? neither if
we had, could we make use of any. So that when
we had rowed, or rather were driven about a
league and a naif, a- raging wave, like a lofty
mountain, came rolling astern of us, and took us
with such fury, that at once it overset the boat.
Thus being swallowed up in a moment, we had
Jiardly time to call upon the tremendous name of
God: much less to implore, in dying ejaculations^
his infinite mercy to receive our departing fouls.
Men are generally counted insensible, when
struggling in the pangs of death; but'while I was*
overwhelmed with water, I had the most dreadful
apprehensions imaginable;, for the joys of heaven
and the torments of hell, seemed to present them*
selves before me in these dying agonies, and even
the small space of time, as it were, between life and
death. I was going, I thought, I knew not whe*
ther, in a dismal gulf unknown, and as yet un-
perceived, never to behold my friends, nor the,
light of this world any more! Could I even have
thought-
thought of annihilation, or a total dissolution of
soul as well as body", the gloomy thoughts of ha-
ving no further being, no knowledge of what we
hoped for, but an eternal quietus, without fife or
fense; even that, I say, would have been enough
to strike me with horror and confusion I-1 strove
however to the last extremity, while all my com-
panions were overpowered and iritombed in the
deep: and it was with great difficulty I kept my
breath till the wave spent itself, and retiring back,
left me on the sliore half dead with the water I had
ta'ken in. As -soon as I got on my feet, I fan as
fast as I could, lest another wave should pursue
me, and carry me back again. But* for all the
haste I made, I could not avbid it; for the sea
came after me like a high mountain, or furious
enemy; so that my business was to hold my breath*
and by raising myself on the water, preserve it by
swimmings The next dreadful wave buried me at
once twenty, or thirty foot dcep^ but at the sanie
time carried me with a mighty force"and swiftnese
toward the sliore; when raising myself, I held out
as well -as possible, till at length the water having
spent itself, began to return, at which I struck
forward, and feeling ground with my feet, I took
to my heels again. Thus being served twice more,
I was at last dashed against a piece of a rock, in
such a manner as left me senseless; but recovering
a little before the return of the wave, which, no
doubt, would then have overwhelmed me, I held
fast by the rock till those succeeding waves abated;
and then fetching another run, was overtaken by
a small: wave, which was soon conquered* But
before any more could overtake me, I reached the
main land, where* clambering up the clifts of the
shore, tired and almost spent, I sat down on the
grass, free from the dangers of the foaming pcean.
No tongue can express the ecstasies and tran-
 - sports
sports that my foul felt at this Happy deliverance;
It was like a reprieve to a dying malefactor,, with
the halter about his neck, and ready to be turned
off. I was wrapt up in contemplation, and often
lifted up my bands, with the profoundest humility,
to the divine powers, for saving my life, when
the rest of my companions were all drowned* And
now I'began to cast my eyes around, to behold
what place I was in, and-what I had next to do*
I could fee no house nor people t I was wet, yet
had no cloaths to shift me; hungry and thirsty,
yet nothing to eat or drink.; no weapon to de-
stroy, any creature for my sustenance, nor defend
myself against devouring beasts. In short I had
nothing but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a box half
filled with tobacco* The darksome night coming
upon me, increased my fears of being devoured
by wild creatures; my mind was plunged in de-
spair, and having no prospect, as I thought, of life
before me, I prepared for another, kind of death
than what I had lately escaped. I walked about a
furlong to see if I could find any fresh water, which
I did, to my great joy; and taking a quid of to-
bacco 'to prevent "hunger, I got up into a thick
bushy tree, and seating myself so that I could not
fall, a deep sleep overtook me, and for that night
buried my sorrows in a quiet repose.
It was broad day the next morning before I a-
wakened; when I not only perceived the tempest
was ceased, but saw the ship driven almost as far
as the rock before mentioned, which-the waves
had dashed me. against, and which was about a
mile from the place where I was. When I came
down from my apartment in the tree, J perceived
the ship's boat two mrles distant on my right hand,
lying on- shore, as the waves had cast her. I
thought to have got to her; but there being an
inlet of water of about half a mile's breadth be?~
. tweeji
j:wBen"IFIncf me, I returned again towards the* j
ship, as hoping to find something for my morq im- »
mediate subsistence. About noon when the sea
^was calm, that I could come within a quarter of J
a mile of her, it was to my grief I perceived, that |
if we had kept on boards all our lives had been
saved. These thoughts, and my solitude, drew
;tears from my eyes, though all in vain. So re-
solving to get to the ship, I stripped and leaped in-
Jio the water; Avlien swimming round her I was'
afraid I should riot get any thing to lay. hold of;
but it was my good fortune to espy a small piece .
•of rope hang down by the forechains so low, that,
by the help of it, though with great difficulty, I
got into she forecastle of the ship. Here I found
that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of %
water in her hold; her stern was lifted up against!
a bank, a^id her head almost to the Water. All/;
Her quarter, and what was there, were free and
dry. The provisions I found in good.brder; with
which I crammed my pockets; and, losing no time,
ate while I was doing .other things; I also found
some rum,\>jr which Ltook a hearty- dram; aiad
no$r;I wanted .for nothing except aJboat, which
indeed was all, to carry away what was needful *

I Went to work again^ tutting a spare topmast in-
\ - to
^to.three lengths, adding them to my raft with $
great deal of labour and pains. I then considered
what I should load it with, it Being not able to
bear a ponderous burden. And this I soon thought
of, first laying upon it all the planks and boards I
could get; next 1 lowered down three of the-sea-
men's chests, after Ihad filled them with bread,
rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried
goats flesh, and some European corn, what little
the rats had spared; and for liquors, I found se-
veral cafes of bottles belonging to our skipper, in
which were some cordial waters, and four or five
gallons of rack, which I slowed by themselves.
By this-time the tide beginning to flow, I percei-
ved my coat, waistcoat, and shirt swim away,
which I had left on the shore; as for my linen,
breeches and stockings, I swam with them on to
the ship: but I soon found cloaths enough, though
I. took no more than I wanted for the present.
My eyes were chiefly on tools to work with; and
after long search, I found out the carpenter's chest,
which I got safe down on my raft. I then looked
for arms and ammunition, and in the great cabin
found two good fowling-pieces, two pistols, seve-
ral powder-horns filled, a small bag of shot, and
two old rusty swords. I likewise found three bar-
rels of powder, two of which were good, but the
third had taken water, also two or three broken
bars, two saws, an axe, and a hammer. I then
put to sea, and in getting to shore had three en-
couragements, t. A smooth calm sea. 2. The
tide rising and setting into the shore. * 3. Thelit-
tle wind there was blew towards land. After I
had sailed about a mile, I found the raft to drive
a little distance from the place where I first land-
ed, and then I perceived an opening of the land,
with a strong current of the tide runing into it;
upon which I kept in the middle of the stream. But
.great
great was my concern^ when on a sudden the fore
part of my raft ran aground; so that had I not,
with great-difficulty; for near half an hour, kept my
back straining against the chests to keep my effects
in their places, .all I had would have gone into the'
sea. But after some time, the rising of the water
caused the raft to float again, and coming up a lit*
tie river, ^irfi land on both sides, I landed in a lit-
tle cave, as near the mouth as possible, the better
to discover* a sail, if any such providentially pat-
fed that way. .
Not far off, I espied a hill of a stupendous height,
surrounded with lesser hills about it, arid thither I
was resoved to go and view the country, that I
miglit see what part was best to fix my habitation
in. Accordingly, arming myself with a pistols a
fowling piece, powder and ball, I ascended the
mountain. There I perceived, I was in an island,
encompassed by the sea; no distant lands to be seen,
but scattering rocks that lay to the west: that it
seemed to be a barren place, and, as I thought,
inhabited only by wild beasts. I perceived abun-
dance of fowls, but ignorant of what kind, x>v
whether good for nourishment. I shot one of them
at my return, which occasioned a confused scream-
ing among the other birds; and I found it, by its
colours arid beak, to be a kind of a hawk, but its
ilefli was perfect carrion.
When I came to my raft, I brought my effects
on shore, which work spent that day entirely; arid
fearing that some cruel beasts might devpur me in
the night time while I slept, I made akindofhutor
barricade with the chests and boards I had brought
on shore. That night-I slept very comfortable;
and the next morning my thoughts were employ,-
ed to mal^e a further attempt on the sliip, and bring"
away what necessaries I could find, before another
storm shopld break her * to pieces. Accordingly I
: 0. got
got on board as before, and prepared a second raft,
far more nice than the first; upon which I brought
away the carpenter's stores, two or three bags
full of nails, a great jack-screw, a drzen or two of
hatchets, and a grindstone. I also took away seve-
ral things that belonged to the gunner, particular-
ly two of three iron crows, two barrels of muftet
bullets, another fowling-piece, a small quantity of
powder, and a large bagful of small shot. Besides
these, I took all the men's cloaths I could find, a
spare foretop-sail, a hammock, and some bedding;
and thus, compleating my second cargo, I made all
the haste to shore I could, fearing some wild beast
might destroy what I had there already. But I
only found a little wild cat sitting on one of the
chests, who not scemingto fear me, or the gun *
that I presented at her, I threw her a piece of bis-
cuit, .which she instantly ate and departed.
, When,I had gotten these effects^on -shore, I went
to work, in order to make me a little tent with the
fail and some poles, which I had cut for that pur-
pose; and having finished it, what things might be
damaged by the weather, I brought in, pilihgallthe
empty chests and casks in a circle, the better to for-
tify it against any soddjiii attempt of man or beast.
After this, I blocked up the doors with some boards,
and an empty chest, turned the long way out. I
.then charged my gun and pistol, and laying my bed
on the ground, slept as comfortably, till next mor-
ning, as though Ihadbeen in a Christian country*
Now, tho' 1 had enough to subsist me along time,
yet despairing of a sudden deliverance, or thai;
both ammunition and provision might be spent be-
fore such a thing happened, 1 coveted as much as
I could; and so ldng as the sliip remained in that
condition, I daily brought away one necessary or
other; particularly the rigging, fails, and cordage,
and some twine, a? barrel of wet powder, some ft**
;. .  •.»"*- . ga
gar, a barrel of meal, three caiks of rum, andf
what indeed was most welcome to me, a whole
hogshead of bread.
The next time I went, I cut the cables in pieces,
carried off a haulser whole, with a great deal of
iron work, and made another raft with the mizen.
and sprit-sail-yards; but this being so unwieldy, by
the too heavy burden I had upon it, and not being
able so dexterously to guide it as the former, both
my cargo and I were overturned. For my part,
all the damage I sustained was a wet skin: and at
low water, after much labour in diving, I got
most of the-cables, and some pieces of iron.
Thirteen days had I now been in the island, and
eleven times on board, bringing away all that was
possible; and, 1 b€lieve, had the weather been calm,
1 should have brought away the whole ship piece
bypiece. As 1 was going the twelfth time, the
Wind,began to rife; however, 1 ventured at low
water, and rummaging the cabin, in a locker I
found several razors, scissars, and some dozens of
knives and forks; and in anotherthirty -six pounds
in pieces of eight, silver and gold. Ah I Jims It
vanity, said I, whom this world Jo much dotes on^
where if now thy virtueWjM&y excellency to me P
you cannot procure me one wing needfuls nor remove
me from this desolate ijland to a place of plenty. Owe
of these knives, so meanly ejl earned, is to me more
preferable than all this heap. E'en therefore re*
main where thou art, to Jink in the deep as. unre*
garded, even as a creature whose life is not worth
preserving. Yet, after all this exclamation, I
wrapt it up in a piece of canvas, and began to
think of making another raft; but I soon percei-
ved the wind begin to arise,- a fresh gale blowing,
from the shore, and the flcy overcast with clouds
and darkness. So thinking a raft to be in vain,
I let myself into the water with what things I had
C 2 , --. about:
about me; and it was with much difficulty I got a>
shore, when soon after it blew a fearful storm*
That night I slept very contentedly in my littlfc
tent, surrounded with all my effects; but when I
looked out in the mornings no more sliip was to
be seen. This much surprised me for the present:
yet, when I had considered I had lost no time, a-
*bated no pains, and had got every thing useful
out of her, I comforted myself in the best manner:,
and entirely submitted to the will of Providence.
My next thoughts were, howl mould defend
and secure myself from savages and wild beasts,
if any such were in the island. At one time I thought
of digging a cave, at another I was for erecting a
a tent, and, at length, I resolved to do both:
The manner or form of which will not, I hopej
be unpleasing to describe. *
When I considered the ground where Iwas, that:
it was moorish, and had no fresli water near it,
. roy resolutions were to search for a soil healthy
and well watered, where I might nor only be wel-
tered* from the sun's scorching heat, but be morfc
conveniently situated, as well to be secured from
wild men, and beasts of prey, as more easily to
discover-any distant fa||| ihould it* ever Ib happen*
And indeed it was not long before I had my de-
sire. I found a little plain near a rising hill, the
front towards which being as steep as a house*
fide, nothing could descend on me from tfie top.
On the fide of this rock was a little hollow place,
resembling the "entrance or door of a cave. Just
before this place, on the circle of the green, Ire-
solved my tent mould stand. This plan did not
much exceed a hundred yards broad, ^nd about
twice, as long, like a delightful green before my
.door, with a pleasing, thoJ irregular descent every
way to tfyef low grounds by the sea-fide, lying on
the N* N* W* side of the bill, so that it was sliel-
tered
tfered from the excessive heat of the sun. After'
this I drew a semicircle, containing ten yards in
its scmidiameter, and twenty yards in the whole,
driving down jtwo rows of strong flakes not six
inches from^each other. Then with the pieces of
cable which I had cut on board, I regularly laid
them in the circle between the piles up to their
tops, which were mare than five feet out of the
earth, and after drove auother row.of piles look-
ing within fide against them, between two or
three feet high, which made me conclude it a lit-
tle impregnable castle for men and beasts. And
for my better security I would have-no door, but
entered in and came * out by the help of a ladder j?
which Ijalso made,
Here was my fence and fortress, into which I
carried all my riches, ammunition, and stores.
After which, working oa the rock, what with the.
dirt and stones I dig out, I not only raised my
ground two seer, but made a little cellar to my
mansion house; and this cost me many days labour
and pains; One day, in particular a shower of rain
falling, thunder and lightening ensued, which put
me in terror iest my powder should take fire, and
not only hinder, my necei&ry subs if rence, by kil-
ling me food, but even Wo\% up me and my htibi--
tation. To prevent which, fI fell to making box-
es and bags, in. order to separate it; having by
me. near 150 weight. And thus being established
as king of the island, every day^ I went out with
my gun to fee what I could kill that was fit to*
eat. I soon perceived numbers of goats, but ve*
ry shy; yet having watched them1 narrowly, and*
seeing I could better ihoot off the rocks than when
in the low grounds, I happened to.slioot a slie-
goat suckling a young kid; which not thinking-it^
dam slain, stood by her-unconcerned 5 and when I-
took the dead creature up, the young one follow^

ed me eveii to the inclosure. I lifted the U\d over
the pales, and would willingly have kept it alive $
but finding it could not be brought to eatt 1 was
forced to slay, it also for my own subsistence.
- Thus, entered into as strange a scene of life as
ever a"hy man was in, I had most melancholy ap-
prehensions concerning my deplorable condition;
ahd many times the tears would plentifully
run down my face, when I considered how I was
_ debarred from all communication with human
kind. , Yet while these desponding cogitations
would seem to make me accuse Providence, other
good thoughts would interpose and reprove me
after this manner: Well, supposing you are so de*»
solate, is it not better to be so than totally pe-
rish? Why were you singled out to Be .saved, and
the rest destroyed? Why should you complain,
when not only your life is preserved, but the ship
driven even into your reach, in order to take what
was neceflary out of her for your subsistence? But
to proceed; It was by the account I kept, the 30th
®f September* when I first landed on this island.
^Soutvtwelve days after, fearing lest I should'lose
my reckoning of time, nay, even forget the. Sab-
bath-days, for want of pen, ink, and paper, I car** ,.
ved with a knife upon a large post, in greatlettersr
-and set it up^ in the similitude of a cross, on the
fea--shore where I landed, I came on shore Sept*,304.
1659* Every day I cut a notch with my^khife on
the sides of this square postr and that on Sabbath:
was as long again as th$ rests and every first day
of the month, as long again as that long one. In
this manner I kept my calendar, weekly, monthly,;
or yearly reckoning of time, Bur had I made a
more strict search, (as I did afterwards,.^ 1 needs
not have set up this, mark. For among the par-
cels belonging to the gunner, carpenter and cap-
tains mate, I found those very thing? I wanted $,;
gacti*-
particularly pens, ink and paper; also \ found two
x>r three compasses, some mathematical instru-
ments, dials, perspective glasses, books of naviga-
tion, three English Bibles, and several othef good
books, which I carefully put up. Here I cannot,
but call to mind our having a dog and two cats on
board, whom I made inhabitants with me in my
castle. Though one might think I had all the ne-
cessaries that were desirable, yet still 1 found se-
veral things wanting. My ink was daily wasting:
I wanted needles, pins, and thread to mend or keep
my cloaths together; and particularly a spade, pick*
axe, or shovel, to remove the earth. It was a
year before I finished my little bulwark; and having
some intervals of relaxation, after my daily wan-
dering abroad for provision, I drew up this plats*
alternately, as creditor and debtor, to remind nit
of the miseries and blessings of my life, under so
many various circumstances.
Evil.
I am cast upon a desolate
island, having no hopes,
no projpecj $f a welcome
deliverance.
How miserably am I Jin-
gled out' from the enjoy-
ment or company of all
mankind.
Like %n hermit {rather
Jhould I fay a lonely an-
chorite), am Iforced from
human conversation.
My cloaths after some
time will be worn out/
and then 'I/halt have none
t& cover me. *
Good.
But yet I am prefer*
ved, while my companions
are periled in the raging
ocean. , > ,
Yet set apart to be spar-
ed from death. And he?
who. has so preserved me^
can deliver me from this:
condition.
However, I have food
to cat^ and even a hap-*
?y prispeft of subsistence
whilst life endures.
At present I enjoy what
is absolutely needful; and
the climate rs'sb hot, that
had I never so many, I
should hardly wear them*

LIFE andADVENTURES'
Evil.
When my ammunition
is wafted^ * then /hall I re-
main without any defence
against 'wild men and
beasts*
I have no creature, no
foul to speak t&; none to

comfort would it be to re-
sound my wo~es where
am understood, and beg
ajjstance where I might
hope for relief

Yet if it does, I fee no

upon that coast.
Is there not God to con~

to relieve thee? Already
has he afforded thee suste-

.' And now easing my mind a little ^y these re~
flections, I began to render my life as easy as pos*
sible. '-. .• . . *
I must here add, ta.the description I have given
©f my habitation, that having rajsed a turf-wall a-
gainst die outside of it,. I thatched it so "close, as^
anight keep it from tHe inclemency of the weather;
1 also improved it within, enlarged my cave, and
made a passage and a door in the uoek, which came
-out beyond the pale, of my fortification- 1 next
proceeded to make a chair and table, and so be--
gan to study such mechanical arts as seemed to me/
practicable. When I wanted a plank or board, I
hewed down a tr£e with my hatchet, making it as
thin with my axe as poifible, and then smooth*
enough with an adze to answer mydesigns: yet
though 1 could make no more this way than one
board out of a tree, in length of time I got boards
enough to shelter, all my stores, every thing being
regularly placed, and my guns securely hanging,
against the side of the.rock. This made it a veryV
pleasant sight to me, and being.the result of vast,
labour and diligence j which leaving for a whiler
and-
and me to the enjoyment of, I shall give the read-
er an account of my Journal from the day of my
landing, till the fixing and settling of my habitat
tion. as heretofore shewn.
JO U R N A L«
SEptember 30th, 1659, I unhappy Robinson
Crusoe^having sufFered shipwreck, was driven
on this desolate island, which I named the Desolatfe
island of Despair, the rest being swallowed up in
the tempestuous oceafi. The next day I spent in
consideration of my unhappy circumstances, having
no prospect but of death, either to be starved with
hunger, or devoured by beasts or merciless savages.
Octob. 1. That mtirhing with great comfort I
beheld-the ship drove ashore. Some hopes I had,
that when the storm yvæ abated, I might be able
ter get some food and necessaries out of her; which
1 conceived were not damaged, because the ship
did stand upright. - At% this time I lamented the
lbss of my companions, and our misfortune in
leaving trie vessel. When I perceived the ship as
it were lye dry, I waded through the sands, then
swam aboard, the weather being very rainy* and
with scarcely any wind. "*
To the 14th of this month, my time was em-
ployed ih making voyages, every tide getting what
I could out of the ship. The weather very wet
and uncertain. '
Octob. 20. My raft and all the goods thereon,
were overset; yet I recovered most again at- low
'Ivater. -'
Octob. 25. It blew hard, and rained n5ght and
day, when the ship went in pieces, so that nothing
was
was seen of her but the wreck at low water. This
day I secured my goods from the inclemency of the
weather, -
Octob, 2.6. I wandered to fee where I» could find
. a place convenient for my abode. I fixed upon a
rock in the evening, marked out a half-moon, in-
tending to erect a wall, fortified with piles, lined
, within with pieces of cables, and covered with turf,.
Nov. i. I erected my tent under a rock, and
took up my lodgings very contentedly in a ham-
mock that* night. * ^' >
Nov. 2. This day I fenced myself in with timber,
chests, and boards.
Nov. 3. I sliot two wild fowl, resembling ducks,
which were good to eat, and in the afternoon
made me a table.
Nov. 4. I began, to live regularly. In the morn-
ing I allowed myself two or three hours to walk
out with my gun; I then worked till near eleven
o'clock;* and afterwards refreshed myself with what
I had to eat. From twelve to two I would lye.,
down to sleep. Extreme sultry weaiher. In the^
evening go to worJc again.
Nov. 5. Went out with my gun and dog, shot
a wild cat with a soft skin,, but her flesh was good
for nothing. The lkins of those I killed I preser-
ved. In my return J perceived many wild b rds,
and was terrified by some seals which made off to
sea, . ** • .'
Nov. 6., Compleatedmy table*
. Nov. 7. Fair weather.. I worked till the 12th,
but ommitted the nth, which according to my cat
culation, I supposed to be Sunday.
, Nov. 13. Rain in abundance, which, however,
much cooled the earth; with thunder and lighten-
ing, caused in me a terrible surprise. The wea-
ther clearings I secured my powder in separate
parcels.
Nov..
'INJpv. 14;—16. I made little boxes for ray powder,
lodging'them in several places. I also mot a large
fowl, which proved excellent meat.
Nov. 17. I began to dig in the rock, yet was
obliged to desist for want of a pick-axe, shovel, and
wheel-barrow. Iron crows I caused to supply the
place of the first; but with all my*art I could not
make a wheel-barrow.
Nov. 18. It was my fortune to find a tree, re-
sembling what the Brasilians call an iron-tree, t
had like to have spoiled my axe with cutting it,"be-
ing very hard and exceeding heavy: yet with much
labour and industry, I made a sort of a spade out
of it. - 
Nov. 23. These tools being made, I daily car-
ried on my business; eighteen days I allowed for
enlarging my cave, that it might serve me, not
only for a ware-house, but kitchen, parlour, and
cellar. I commonly lay in the tent, unless: the
weather was rainy that I could not lye dry. So
wet would it be at certain seasons, that I was o-
bliged to cover all within ths pale with long poles,
in the form of rafters, leaning against the rock,
and load them with flags and large leaves of trees,
resembling a thatch.'
Dec. 10. No sooner did I think my habitation
finished, but suddenly a great deal of the top broke
in, so that it was a mercy I was not buried in the
ruins. This occasioned a great deal of pains and
trouble to me, before I could make it firm anddu*
rable.:
Dec. 17. I nailed up some shelves, and drove
nails and staples in the wall, and posts to hang
things out of the way.
Dec. 20. Every thing I got into its place, them
made a sort of* dresser, and another table.
Dec, 2^. 25. Rain in abundance.
'Dec^.ao^ Vfiry fair weather.
Dec
Dec. 27. I chanced to-light on some goats, staot
pne, wounded another; I led it Jiome in a strings
^ bound up his leg, and cured it in a little time; at
length it became so tame and familiar as to feed
before the door, and follow me where-1 pleased.
This put me in mind to bring up tame creatures,
in order to supply me with food after my ammu-
nition was spent,
Dec, 28, 29, 30* The weather being excessive
hot with little air, obliged me for the most part to
keep within doors*.
Jan. 1. Still sultry. However, obliged by ne-
cessity, I went out with my gun, and found a great
fibre of goats in the valleys; they were exceed-
ingly shy, nor could any dog hunt them down.
/ Jan. 3, to 14. My employment this time was
to finish the wall before described, and search the"
island. I discovered a kind of pigeons like our
house-pigeons in a nest among the rocks. I brought
them home, nursed them till they Qould fly, and
then they left me. After this I shot some, which
proved excellent food. Some time I spent vainly
in contriving to make a cask; I may well say it
^as vain, because I could neither join the staves,
or fix the heads, so as to makelt tight; so leaving
that, I took some goats' tallow I had by me, and
a little oakum for the wick, and provided myself
\yith a lamp, which served me instead of candles.
But now a very strange event happened. For
faeing in the height of my search, what should come
into my hand, but a bag which was used to hold
corn (as iTupposed for the fowls,) so immediate-
ly resolving to put gunpowder in it, I shook all
the husks and dirt upon one fide* of the rock, little
expecting what the consequence would be. The
rain had fallen plentifully a few days before; and
about a month after, to my great amazement, some-
thieg began to look out very green and flourish-
ing;
ing: and when I came to view it more nicety,* every
6ayas.it gr-ew, I found about ten or twelve ears
of green barley appeared in the very fame shape
and make as that in England.
I can scarce express the agitations of my mind
at this fight. Hitherto I had looked upon the ac-
tions of this life, no otherwise than only as the
events of blind chance and fortune. But now, the
ap'pearance of this barley, flourishing in a barren
foil, and my ignorance in not conceiving how it
mould come there, made me conclude, that mira-
cles -were not yet ceased: nay, I even thought that
God had appointed it to grow there without any
feed, purely for my sustenance in this miserable
and desolate island. And indeed such great affect:
this had upon me, that it oft€n made me melt into
tears, through a grateful fense of* God's mercies;
and the greater still was my thankfulness, when I
perceived about this little field of barley, some
rice stalks, also wonderfully flourishing.
While thus pleased in mind, I concluded there
must be more corn in-the island; and therefore
made a diligent search nafrowly among th® rocks;
but not being able to find any, on a sudden it camie
into my mind, how I had maken the husks of doru
out of the hag, and- then my admiration ceased,
with my gratitude to the divine Being, as thinking
it was but natural, and not to be conceived a mi-
racle; tho* even the manner of its-preservation
might have made me own it as a wonderful event
of God's kind providence.
It was about the latter end of June .when the
ears of this corn ripened, which I laid up-very
carefully, together with 20 or 30 stalks -of rice/
-expecting one day I mould reap the fruit^of mf
labour; yet four years were expired before-I'cduld
allow-myself to eat any barley bread, and much
longer ;tirue before I had any flcQ,; -After"this*
% t> with
with indefatigable pains and industry for three or
four months, at last I finished my wall on the 14th,
of April, having* no way to go into It, but by a .
ladder against the wall. '« . •
; April 16th I finished my ladder, and ascended it;
afterwards pulled it up, then let it down on the
other side, and descended-into my new habitation,
\v,here I had space enough, and so fortified, that
nothing could attack me, without scaling the walls.
But what does all human pains and industry a-
vail, if the blessing of God does not* crown our
labours?- Or, who can stand before* the Almighty,
when he slretGheth forth his arm? For one time,
;as I was at the entrance of my cave, there happenedx
such a dreadful earthquake, that not only the roof
of the cave came tumbling about my ears, but the
jthe posts seemed to crack; terribly at the same time%
This put me in.great amazement; and running to
xbe ladder, and getting over the wall, I then plain-
ly knew it was an earthquake, the placed stood
on sustaining three terrible sliokes in less than three
aninutes; But judge of my terror when I saw the
top of agreat rock*roll into the sea; I then expec*
ted the island would be swallowed up every mo-
ment: And what made the scene still more dread-
ful, was tp see the sea thrown into the most violent
agitations anddisorders by this tremendous accident.
For my part, I stood like a criminal at the place
of execution, ready to expire. At the moving of
she earjth,- I was, as it were, sea-tick; and very
Touch afraid Jest the rock, under which was my
'fence afid habitation, should overwhelm me and it
in a lasting tomb.
, .When the third dreadful shock had spent itself,
my spirits began to revive; yet still 1. would not
venture to; ascend the ladder, but continued sitting
mot knowing what I should do. So little grace had
;I then,, as only .to (^yJ>Lord) have mercy upon 1M. I
and
and no sooner was the earthquake over, but that
pathetic prayer left me.
It was not long after, when a horrible tempest;
arose, at the fame time attended with" a^urricane*
of wind. The sea seemed .mountains high, and thev
waves rolled so impetuously, that l|^£ing could*
be pef ceived but froth and foann Tfe-ff-fiours did^
^ this storm continue, and in so violent k manner,
as to tear the very trees up by the roots, which*
was succeeded by abundance of rain. When,-the
tempest was over, I went .to my tent? but" the'rain1
cdming on in a furious manner, I was obliged to.
take shelter in the cave, *where I was forced to
cut a channel through my fortification to let the
water Out. It continued raining .'alt that night,
and some time the next day. These accidents made
me resolve, as soon as the weather cleared up, to-
build me a little hut in. some, open place, walled-
round to defend me from wild-creatures and sava- .
ges ; not doubting, but, at the next earthquake, the-
mountain would fall upon my habitation and me,,
and swallow up all in its bowels.
April 16, t-,20, These days I spent in con-
triving how and in what manner I should' six my
• place of abode. A41 this while I was £md,er the*
"mqst dreadful apprehensions. When I looked rounds
my habitation, every thing I found in its proper
place. 1 had several resolutions \vbether I should*
move or not: but at length I resolved, to stay
wherel was, till I found out a convenient place-
where I might pitch my tent.
^pril 22. When I bdgan to put my resolutions-
in practice, I was stopt for want of tools and in-
struments to work with. Most of my axes-and
hatchets were useless, occasioned by cutting the
hard timber that grew on the island;- It took me
up a fujl week to make my grindstone of ,use lo-
me} and at last I found out a way to turn it a-

April 30. My bread falling short, I allowed my-
self but one biscuit a day.
May 1. As I walked along the sea-more, I found
a barrel of gunpowder, and several pieces of the-
wreck,'which the sea haa* filing up. Having se-
cured those 1 made to the ship, whose stern wa&
torn off, * and washed a great distance aslidr'e; but
the rest lay in the sands. These 1 supposed was-
occasioned by the earthquake. I now resolved to
keep my old place of abode: and also to go to the
ship that day," but then found it impossible.
May 3 This day 1 went on boards and with my
saw sawed off one of the beams, which kept her
quarter deck. I then cleared the sand till flood.
May 4» I caught some fish, but they werenot whole-
some. The same day I also catched a young dolphin.
May 5. This day I also repaired to the wredt,

flood came, I made a float of three great planks,,
which >vas driven ashore by the tide. . -

Prayed to God'in these word;>; Lord^ in pity, loob
upon me 1 Lgrd have mercy upon me; have mercy
upon me! After this I fell asleep, which 1 found'
had much refreslied me when I awaked. T.fell a~
k steep a second time, and fell into this strange and1*
terrible fort of dream::
Methought I was sitting on the fame spot of
ground* at the outside of the wall where! sat when-
the storm blew after the earthquake; and that P
sow aman descending from a great black cloud,
arid light upon the ground. He'w all over: as*,
bright as a flash of fire that a little before surroun-
ded him; his countenance inconceivably terrible^
the-earth as it were trembled when he stept upon
the ground, andflasties of fire seemed to fill all*'
the air. No-sooner I thought him landed upon-
the earth, but with a long spear or other weapon
he made towards me; but first ascending a rising
ground, his voice added to my amazement, when* -
1 thought I heard-him pronounce these dreadful
words, Unhappy wretch! seeing all these things*
tiave not brought tltee to rtpentanc-e, thouJJwlt im-
-Mediately, die. In pronouncing this dreadful sen-
tences I thought he went to kill me with the spear
that was in his hand.
Any body may think it impossible for me to ex-
press the horrors of my mind at this vision; and
even when I awaked, this very dream made a deepi
impression upon my mind. The little divine know^-
ledgel had, I received from my father's instruc-
tions, and that was worn out by an uninterrupted
ieries of seafaring impiety for eight years space*
Except what sickness forced from, me, I do not re*
member I had one thought of lifting up my heart*
towards God; but rather had a certain stupidity
of foul, not having the least fense of fearof the
J. - omnipotent
omnipotent Being when in distress, hor of grati-
tude^ to him for his deliverances. ,Nay, when I
was on the.desperate expedition on the delart A-
frican shore, I cannot remember I had one thought
of what would become of me, or to beg his conso-
lation and assistance in my sufferings and distress*
When th,e Portugal captain took me up, and ho-
uourably used .me; day, farther, when I was evert
delivered from drowning by escaping to this islands
I never looked upon it as a judgment, but only
said "I was an unfortunate dog, and that's alh~ In-t
deed some secret transports of foul I had, which
was not through grace, but only a common flights
of joy, that I was yet alive, when my companions
were all drowned, and no other joy could I con-
ceive hut what is common with the sailors over a
bowl of punch, after they have escaped the great-
est dangers* ^ .
The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor*
conveniences, might have called upon me for a
thankful acknowledgment to Providence^ Indeed;
the growth "of; my corn tonched me "with some
sense; but that soon wore off again. The terrir
ble earthquake pointed to me as it were the finger
of God, but my dreadful amazement continued no
longer than its duration. But now, when my spi-
rits began to link under the burthen of a strong
distemper, aocll could leisurely view the miseries
of death present themselves before my eyes; then
my awakened conscience began to I'eproach me
with my past life,, in which 1 had so wickedly pro-
voked the justice of God, to pour down his ven*
geance'upon me.
Such reflections-as these oppressed me even in
the violence of my distemper. Some prayers I
uttered which only "proceeded from my fear of
death* But when I, considered my father's advice
and prophecy, I could not forbear weeping $ for
\. "- • he
he tojd me, That if I did persist In my folly i I should
not only be deprived of Gad's blessing, but have time
enough to nested upon my despising his instructions?*
and this in a wretched time, ivhen n6\re could helpi
me. And now concluding it to be fulfilled, having;
no soul in the island to administer any comfort to
me, I prayed earnestly to the Lord, that He would
help me in this ray great calamity. And this, I
thinly was the first time I prayed in sincerity Cor
many years. But now I must return to my jour-
nal. . . ,
June 12.8. Something refreshed with sleep, and^
the fit quite off," I got up.. My dream still occa>
fioned m me a great consternation; and fearing:
thatube agtte might return the succeeding day^ I
concluded it time to get something to comfbrt:mc^
I filled a eaft-bottle with water, and set it withiri-
the reach of my bed; and to make it more nourish* *
frig, and less cfhilly, I put some rum into it. The"
next thing I did was to hoil me a piece of goat*-
flesh, of which I ate but little, I was very weak ;,
however, walked about, dreading the return of
my distemper; and at night I supped on three of
the turtle's eggs, which I roasted and ate, beg-
ging God's blessing therewith.
* After I had eaten, I attempted to walk again>
put of doors with my giin; but was so weak, that
I sat down, and Idoked at the sea, which was *
smooth and calm.1 While! continued here, theses
thoughts came into my mind: *" ' v
'^ In what manner'is the production of the earth,
and sea, which I have seen so much of? Fromr
-whence came-myself, and all other creatures Ji*
ving, and of what are w^e made?
Our beings were assuredly created by -some al-
mighty invisible powers who framed the earth, the -
sea, and air, and all therein. But what is that;
power?
Certainly
Certa'nly it must follow, that God has created
it all. Yet, said I, if God has made all this, he
roust be the ruler of them Jill, and what is rela-
ting thereto; for certainly the power that makes,
must indisputably have a power to guide and di-.
reel: them. And if this be so (as certainly it must,)
nothing can happen without his knowledge or ap-
pointment. Then surely if nothing happens with-
out God's appointments certainly God nas appoint-
ed these my sufferings to befal me. And here -I
fixed my firm belief, that it wa§ his will that it
ihould be so; and then proceeded to inquire, why
should God deal with me in this manner? Or
What have I done thus to deserve his indignation?
Here conscience flew in niy face, reprehending*
me as, a blasphemer; crying with a loud and pier-
cing voice, Unworthy'wretch"! dare you a/k what
you have done P Look upon your fast life-y and sec-
what you have left undone P Aik thyself,* why, thou
wcrt'not long ago m the merciless hands of Dcrtth?
Why not drowned in Yarmouth roads, or killed
in the fight when the ship was taken by the Sallee
man of war? Why not intombed in the bowels of
wild'beasts an'the African coast, or drowned here
when all thy companions, suffered shipwreck in the
ocean-? - > -... • "•'-.'/ .• vf 'r >•-,,.
Struck, dumb with these reflections, I: rose up in
a pensive manner, being so thoughtful that I could
not go-to steep; and fearing the dreadful return
of my distemper, it caused'me to remember that
the Brasilians used tpbacco for almost all diseases.
I then went to my chest, in order to find some,
where Heaven no doubt directed me to find a cure
for both/oui and body; for there 1 found one of
the Bibles, which till this time I had neither lei-
sure iior inclination to look into; 1 took both the
tobacco and that out of the chest, and laid them
on tlje table. Several, experimentsdid! try with
,.. .;. ."* -; '' . V-  .-?. . sthe
the tobacco': First I took a piece - of leaf, and
chevy ed'it\* but it being very green and strong, al-
most stupifi ed* trie* I^ext I steeped it in some rum
an hour or two* resolving when I went to bed to
take a dose of it; "and in the third place, I burnt
some over a pan of fire, holding my nose over it
so Jong as I could* endure it without suffocation. -
In the intervals of this-operation, though my
head was giddy and disturbed1 at the tobacco, I took
up the Bible to read. No sooner did I open it,
but there? appeared to me these wotds> Call on me
in the day of trouble, and I will deliver theei and
thou fly alt glorify me.
At first this sentence made a very deepnmprest
sion on my.heart; but it soon-wore, off again,
when I considered the word deliver was foreign
to me. And as the children of Israel.said, when
they were promised flesh, to eat, Can God spreads
tablet in the wilderness P in like manner I began tq
say, Can God himseif deliver me from this desolate
island? However, the words would still return
to my mind, and afterwards made a greater im-
pression upon me. As it now was very late, and
the tobacco; had dozed*my head, I was inclined to
sldep? butbeforel would lyiedown^ Ifelhdnmy
knees, and implored the promise that God had
maderto me* in the holy scriptures, that if I called
upon him in the-day of trouble, he would deliver me*.
With milch difficulty I after drank the* rum,* where*
in Is had steeped the ttbaccoj which'flying in my
head, threw me 'into such a profound sleep, jthatr
|r was three o'clock the. next day before Lawata
ed; or rather, I believe, I slept two days, having
certainly lost a day in my account, and I could
n€ver tellany other way. When I "got up, myr
spirits were lively and cheerful; my stomach much
betters being; very hungry; and in short, no fit
returned the next day; which was the 2$th, :but
If bund myself much altered for the better.
The 30th, I went abroad with my gun, but not'
far, and killed a sea-fowl or two, resembling a.
brand-goose, which, however I .cared not to eat
when I brought them home, but dined on two
more of /:he turtle's eggs. In the evening I re-
newed my medicine, excepting that I did not take*
so large a quantity, neither did I chew the leaf,
or hoW my head over the smoke: but next day,
which was the-ist of July, having.a little spice of
the cold fit, I again took my medicine as I did the
n<U time.
'July 3I The^ fit quite left me, but v,ery weak.
In this condition, I often thought of*these words,
/ will: deliver thee; and while at some times I
would think of the impossibility of it, other thoughts
would reprehend me9 for disregarding the deliver-
ances I had received, even from the most forlorn,
and distressed condition. I asked myself, what re-
gard have I had to God for his abundant mercies?
have I done my part? He has delivered me, but I
have not glorified hint ;—as if I had said, I had not
owned and been thankful for these as deliverances,
and how could I expect greater? So much did
this sensibly touch my heart, that 1 gave God
thanks for,my recovery from sickness in the most
laumble prostration. -
July 4. This morning I began seriously to pon-
der pn what is written in the New Testament,
resolving to read a chapter every morning and
night as long as my thoughts would engage me.
As soon as I set about this work seriously, I found
my hears: deeply affected with the impiety of my
past life; these .words that4 I thought were rpq-
lœri to me in my dream revived, Ail these things
have "..not brought thee to repentance. After th&,
I begged of - God to assist me with his Holy Spi-
rit in returning to my duty* One day, in per-
.using the scriptures, I .same to these words, He
is
is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give re*,
fentance, and to give remission: Immediately
I laid down the book, and, with uplifted hands
'to heaven, loudly cried, 0 blejsed Jesus, thou son
,$£ David, Jesus, thou exalted Psince and Saviour,
•give me repentance h And npw indeed J prayed
with a true fense of my condition, and a more cer-
tain hope, founded on the word of God. Now I
had a different sense of these "words, Call on me,,
and I will deliver thee, that is, from the dreadful
load of gnilt, which oppressed my sinful foul,, and
not from a solitary life, which might rather be
/ called a blessing, (seeing I wanted neither food nor
raiment,) when compared with living among the
human race, surrounded with so much oppresiion,-
misery, and affliction: In a word, I came to this
conclusion, that a deliverance from sin was a much
.greater blessing than a deliverance from affliction,.
But again I rJroceed to my journal.
To the 14th of July, I walked about with my
gun little and little at a time, having been redu-
ced to the greatest extremity of weakness. The
applications and experiments I used were perfec-
tly new; neither could I recommend them to any
one's practice. For though it carried off the fit,
it very much weakened me; and I had frequently
.convulsions in my rierves and limbs for some time.
From hence I learned, that going abroad in rainy
weather, especially when it was attended with
flprms and hurricanes of wind, was moit^ pernici-
ous to health. 1 had now been above ten months
in the istand; and as 1 never had seen any of the
humankind, I therefore accounted myself as sole
monarch; and as I grew better, having secured
my habitation to my mind, I resolved to make a
.tour round my kingdom, in order to make new
discoveries,
The 15th of July I began my journey. I"£Mt_
went to the creek, where I had brought mr rafts
on stiore; and. travelling farther, fouml the tide
went no higher than two miles up, where there
was a little bnook of running waters on the bank
of which were many pleasant Savannas or mea-
dows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass. Un
the rising parts, where I supposed the water did
not reach, 1 perceived a great deal of tobacco grow^
'infe to a very strong stalk. Several other plants
I likewise found, the virtues of which 1did not
understand. 1 searched a long time for the Cafla-
va root, which I knew the Indians in that climate
made their bread of; but all in vain. There were
several plants of aloes, though at that time I
knew not what they were; likewise I saw several
sugar-cane, but imperfect for want of cultivation.
With these few discoveries I came back that night,
and slept contentedly in my little castle.
The next day, being the i6th, going the-fame
way, but.farther than the day before, I found the
country more adorned with woods and trees. Here
I perceived different fruits in great abundance.
Melon* in plenty lay on the ground, and clusters
of grapes, ripe and Very rich, spread over the trees.
You may'imagine 1 was glad of this discovery, yet
ate very sparingly, lest I should throw myself in-
to a flux or fever. The grapes I found of excel*
lent use, for when I had dried them in the sun,
which preserved them as dried raisins are kept,
they proved very wholesome atid nourishing, and;
served me in those seasons when no grapes were
-tobehadi . ^ ~
The night drawing on apace, I ascended up u
tree, and slept very comfortably, though it was
the first time I had lien put of my habitation. And
, when the morning came, I proceeded with great-
pleasure'on my way, travelling about four miles,
as I imagined by the length of the vallpyj" direct*
ing my course northwards there being k ridge of
hills on the south and north side of me. At the
end of this v alley, I came to an opening, where the
country seemed todescend tothe west; there I found
a little spring of fresh water, proceeding oat, of
the side of a hill, with its chrystal streams running
directly east. And indeed here my fenses were
charmed with the most beautiful landscape nature
could afford; for the country appeared so flou-
rishing, green, and delightful, that to me It seemed
like a planted garden. I then descended on the
side of that delicious vale, when I found abundance
of cocoa, orange, lemon, and citron trees, but ve-
ry wild and barren at that time. As for the limes,
they were delightful and wholesome, the juice-of
. which I after used to mix in water, Which made it'
yery cool and refreshing. And now I was resolved to
carry home and Jay up a store of grapes, limes
and lemons against the approaching-"wet season.
So laying them up in separated parcels, and then
taking a few of each with me, I returned to my
little oastle, after having spent three days in this
journey* Before I got home, the grapes were so -
bruised that they utterly spoiled; the limes indeed
were good, but of these-? could bring only a few.
- July 19. Having prepared two bags, I returned
thither again; but to my great surprise found all
t}ie grapes spread aboiit, trod to pieces, and abun-/
dance eaten, which made me conclude there were
V/ild beasts thereabouts. To prevent this happen-
ing again, I gathered a large quantity of the grapes,
and hung them upon the out-branches of the^trees,
both tdkeep" them unhurt, and that they might
cure atid dry in the fun: and having well loaded
tnyself with limes and lemons, I returned once
more to my old place of residence.
And now con tempi atihg on the fruitfulness of
this valley, the pleasantness of its situation, its
security
security from stormsr and tlie delightfulnels of rife
adjacent woods, I concluded 1 was settled in the*
worst part of the. country, and therefore was
thinking to remove my habitation. But when I
considered again, that though it was pleasant, it
was off from the sea-side where therfi was a possi-
bility, some time or other, a ship might either be
driven or sail by; and that to inclose myself among
hills and woods must certainly put an end to my
hopes of deliverance; I resolved to let my castld
remain where Providence had first assigned it. Yet
so ravished was I with this place, that I made me,
a little kind of bower, surrounding it with a double
hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked, and
filled with bulrushes; arid having spent a great
part of the month of July, I think it was thd first
of August before 1 began to enjoy my labour.
Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes tb be dry, I took ,
them from the trees, and they proved excellent
good raisins of the fun f the most of which I car*
ried to my cave; and happy for me I did so, by
which I saved the best part of my winter food.
Aug. 14. This day it began to rain; and tho*
I; had made me a tent like the other, yet having no
shelter of a hill to keep rae from storms, nor &
cave behind me to retreat to, I was obliged to ,re«*...
turn to my old castle. The ;ram continued more
or less every day, till the middle of October; and
sometimes so violently that I could not stir out of
my cave for several days*
This season I found my family to increase? for
one of my cats that ran away from me, and who 1
thought had- been dead, returned about August,
with three kittens at herheels, like herself, which
I thought strange, because both my cats were fe-
males, and the wild cats, of the island seemed to
be of a different kind from our European cats $
but from these cats proceeded such numbers, that
E. a . , I was
I *wa$* forced to kill and destroy them as I would
do wild beasts or vermin*
To the 26th of this month I could not stir out,
• it raining incessantly; when beginning to want
food, I was competed to venture twice, the first
?of which I shot a goat, and afterwards found a
very large tortoise. The manner of my regula-
'ting my fobd was thus: A bunch of raisins* served
me for breakfast; a piece of goat's flesh or turtle
broiled for' my dinner, and two or three turtle
'£ggs\farmy supper. While the rain lasted, I daily
worked two or three hours at enlarging my cave,
and by degrees worked it on towards one side, till
I came to the outside of the hill, and made a door
1 ot way out, which canie beyond my fence or wall,
and so I came in and out this way.- But after I
had done this, I was troubled to fee myself thus
enposed; thoiigh 1 could not perceive any thing to
fear, a goat being the biggest creature I had seen
upon fchis iflnnd. - •- .
• Sept. 30. Casting up my notches on my post,
which amounted to 365, I concluded this tq be the
anniversary of my landing; and therefore humbly
prostrating myself on the ground, confessing my
fins, acknowledging God's righteous judgments
.uponrme, and praying to. Jesus Christ to have
mercy on me, I fasted for twelve hours till the
going down of the fun; and then eating a biscuits
• and a bunch of grapes, laid, me on the bed, and
with great comfort took my night's repose. Till
this time I never had distinguished the Sabbath day;
but now I made a longer notch than ordinary for
the days of rest, and divided the weeks as well as
I could, though I found I had lost a day or two in ,
my account. My ink failing loon after, I omitted
in my daily memorandum things of an indifferent
mature, and contented myself to write down only
:the most remarkable events of my life. The rainy
.. ., . :, 'and
and dry seasons appeared now regular to me, and
experience taught me how to provide for them;
yet, in one thing I am going to relate, my expe-
rience very much failed me. You may call tof/
nrnd what I have mentioned of some barley and:
rice which I had saved; about thirty, stalks of the
former, and twenty of the latter; and at that
time the fun being in its- southern position, going
frdm me, together with the rains, made me con-
clude it a very proper season to sow it. Accord--
ingly I dug up a-piece of ground, with my wooden
spade, and dividing it in, two parts, sowed about-
two-thirds of my feed, preserving by me about a^
handful or each. And happy it was I did so; fojp
no rains falling, it was choked up, and never ap-
peared above the earth till the wet season came
again, and then part of it grew, as" if it had been,
newly sovyn.
I was resolved still to make another trial; and
seeking for a moister piece of ground near my
bowei> I- there sowed the rest of my seed in Fe-
bruary, a little before thh vernal equinox; which
having the rainy months of March* and* April to
water it, yielded a noble crop, and sprung"up very
pleasantly. I had still saved part of the seed, not
daring to venture all; and by the' time T found*
out the proper seasons to sow in, and that I might;
expect everyyear two seed-times "and two harvests,
my stock amounted to above half a peck of each-
sort of grain.- ' \
No sooner were the rains over j but the slajces
which I had cut from the trees,'.shot out like wil-
lows the first year after lopping their heads. I
was ignorant 'of the tree I cut them from:-but
they grew ib regularly beautiful, that they made
a most lively appearance, and so flourished in three
years time, that I resolved to cut more of them;
E 3 and
and these soon growing, mao!e a glorious fence, as
afterwards 1 shall observe.
And now I perceived that the seasons of the
year might generally be divided, not into summer
and winter, as in Europe, but into wet and dry
seasons as in this manner.

JThe wet seasons would continue longer or short-
-er as the winds happened to blow* But having
found the ill consequences of being abroad in the
rain, I took "care,before handjto furmih myself
\vith provisions ^and, during tlie wet months, satJ
%ithin doors as much as possible. At this time I
Jflpfa-ived to ma,ke many things that I wanted, tho7,
.tfePB: me much, labour and pains, before I cotilct
accomplish them* The first 1 tried was to make a>
basket; but all the twigs I could get proved so
brittle, that I could not then perform it. It now^
proved of great advantage to m€, that, when a
boy, I took great delight m standing at a baskets
maker's in the fame town where my father lived,
to
to view them at work: and, like other bo)rs, cu-
rious to fee the mariner of their working these?
things, and very officious to assist, I perfectly learn-
ed the method of it, aud wanted nothing but the
tools. And it coming into my mind, that the twigs*
of that tree of which I made my stakes, might be*
as tough as sallow, willow, or osiers, growing in
England, I resolved to make an experiment, and*
went the next day to my country-seat, and found-
some fit for my turn; and after cutting dov/n a*
quantity with my hatchet, I dried them in my pale,
and, when fit to work writbr carried them to my
cave, where I employed myself -in making several,
sorts of baskets, insomuch that J could put in what-*
soever I pleased. It is true, they were not cle-
verly made, yet they served my turn upon alh-oc^
casions. . ^
But still-1 wanted two necessary things. I hacfc
no caik to hold my liquor, except two rundlets*
almost full of rum, a few bottles of an ordinary
size, and some square cafe-bottles; neither had £
a pot to -boil any thing in, only a large kettley.
unfit to make broth, or stew a bit.of meat: I want*'
ed likewise at the .beguiling of this dry season a>
tobacco pipe;, but for this i afterwards found an*,
expedient.
I kept myself employed in planting my second'
row of stakes. But remerobrjng. that-when I tra*
veiled up to the-brook, I had a mind to fee the
whole 'island, I now resumed my intention, and
taking ray dog, gunT hatchet, two biscuil-cakes, a*
great bunch of raisins, with a larger quantity of:
powder and shot than usual, I began my journey.
Having passed the vale where my bower stood, I
came within view os the sea lying to the wests
when, it being a clear day^ I fairly descried land,
extending from the W. to the S. WV about id or
*5 leagues^ as I concluded \ but could not fay
whe*
whether it was an island or a continent* Neither
could I tell what this place might be; only thought
it was part of America, and where I might have
been in a miserable^ condition, had Handed. Again,.
I considered, that if thU was the Spanilh coast,,
certainly, oiie time or other, I should fee some
ihip pass by y and if it was not, then it must be
the Savage coast, between the Spanish country
and Brasi], which abounds with cannibals or man-
eaters. .
As I proceeded forward, I found this side of the.
island much more pleasant than mine; the fields
fragrant, adorned with sweet flowers and verdant
grafs together with several very fine woods. There-
were parrots in plenty, which made me long for
one to be my companion; but it was with great:
difficulty I could knock one down with my stick;
and I kept him at home some years, before 1 could,
get him to call me by my name*
In the low grounds I found various forts of hares
and foxes as I took them to be, but. much different;
from those in England. Several of these I killed,,
but never ate them; neither indeed had I any oc-
casion; for abounding with goat?, pigeons, turtle,
and grapes-, I could defy Leadeiihall. market jto:
furnish me a better table. In this journey I did"
not travel above two miles a-day, because J took,
several turns and windings to fee what discoveries;
1 could make, returning weary enough to the place
where I designed to rest-all night, which was either
in a tree, or to a place which I surrounded with-
stakes, that no wild creature might suddenly sur-
prise me. When 1 came to the sea shore,* I was
amazed to fee the splendor of it. Its. strand was-
covered with sliells of .the most beautiful fish, and-
constantly abounding with innumerable turtles,,
and fowls of many kinds, which i was ignorant of,
except those called Penguins, I might have shot
as
as many as I pleased, bittwas sparing of my ammu-
nition, rather chusing to kill a she-goat, which I
did with mitch difficulty, on account of the flatness
of the country. . ,
Now, though this journey produced the most
pleasing satisfaction; yet my habitation was so much
to my liking, that 1 did not repine at my being
seated on the worst part of the island* I cpnti-
nued my journey, travelling about twelve miles
further towards the east, where I set a great pile
on the shore for a mark, cor eluding that my next
journey should bring me to the other side of. the
island, east from my castle, and sd round till I
came to my post again. As I had a constant view
of the country, t thought I could riot miss my'
way; but scarce had I. travelled three tniles, when
I descended into a very large valley, so surround-
ed with hills covered with wood, that I having no
guidebut by the fun, nor even then, unless I knew
well the position of the fun at that time of the day?
and to add to my misfortune, the weather proving
very hazy, I. was obliged to return to tny pbst~by*
the sea fide, and so backwards the fame way L.
jeame. In this journey my dog surprised a kid;
and would have killed it, had I not prevented him.
As I had often been thinking of getting a - kid or
two, and so raising' a breed of tame goats to sup-
ply me after my .ammunition was spent, I took this
opportunity of beginning:,and having made a col-
lar for this little creature with a string msde of
rope-yarn, I brought it to my bower, and-there
inclosed and left him; and having spent a month
in this journey, at length I returned to my old ha-
bitation. -•-•-.. \'
No body can doubt of my satisfaction, when I
returned to my little castle, and reposed myself in
my hammock. After my journey I rested myself
a week, which time I employed in making a cage
•_ for
for my pretty poll. I now began to consider of
the poor kid I had left at the bower, and I imme*
diatdy went to fetch it home; When I came there,
I found the young creature almost starved; I gave
it some food, and tied it as before: but there was
Ho occasion^ for it followed me like a dog; And
as T -constantly fed it, it became so loving, gentler
and fond, that it commenced one of my domestics,
v and would never leave me.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox be-
ing now come, I kept the 30th of September in
the most solemn manner, as usual, it being the
third year of my abode in the island. I spent the
whole day in acknowledging God'§ mercies; in
giving him thanks for making this solitary life as
agreeable, and less sinful, than 'that of human so*
ciety; and for the communications of his grace to
my foul, in supporting, comforting, aiid encou-
raging me to depend upon his providence, and
hopafof his eternal presence in the world to come*
'Indeed I often did consider how much more hap-
py I was in this state of life than in that accursed:
manner of living I formerly used: and sometimesr
when hunting, or viewing the country, the an-
guish of my foul would break out upon me, and-
my very heart would sink within me, to think of
the woods, the mountains, the desarts I was in:
and how I was a prisoner locked up within the e«f
ternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninha-
bited wilderness without hopes, and without re-
demption* In this condition, Fwould often wring
my hands, and weep like a child: And even some-
times in the middle of my work this fit would
take me 1 and then I would sit down and sighf
looking on the ground for an hour or two toge-
ther, till such time as my grief got vent in a flood
of tears. ~
One morning as I was sadly employed in thi&
man-
manner, I opened my Bible, when immediately I
fixed my eyes upon these words; / will never* leave
ihee, nor forsake thee! Surely, thought I, these
words are directed to me; or else why ssiodid they'
appear just at a moment when I am bemoaning
ttiy forlbrn condition! and if God does not for-
sake me, what matters it, iince he can make me^
more happy in this state of life, than if I enjoyed
the greatest splendor in the'world? But while I
was going to retiirn God thanks for.my present
state, something seemed to shock my mind, as if it
had thus said: Unworthy wretch!* can you pre-
tend to be thankful for a condition, from* which
you would pray to be delivered! Here I stopt;--i-
and though I could not say, I thanked the Divine
Majesty for being there, yet I gave God thanks
for placing to my view my former wicked course
Of life, and granting me a true knowledge of re-
pentance. And whenever I opened or shut the
Bible, I blessed kind Providence, that directed my
good friend in England, to send it among my goods
without my order, and for assisting me to save it
from the power of the raging ocean, -
And now beginning my third year, my several
daily employments were these, First, My duty to
Heaven, and diligently reading the holy scriptures,
which 1 did twice or thrice every day. Secondly,
Seeking provision with my gun, -which commonly
took me up, when it did not rain, three hours
every morning. Thirdly^ The ordering, curing,
^preserving, and cooking what I had killed, or
patched for my supply, which took me up 41 great
part of the day: for in the middle of the day the
sun being in its height, it was so hot, that I could
ttot stir out; so that I had only but four hours in
the evening to work in: and then the want of
tools, of assistance, and skill wasted a great deal
<xf time to little purpose. I was no less than two
and
and forty days making" a board jit for a long shelf,
which two sawyers, with their-tools? and sew-pit,
Would have cut put of the fame tree in half a day*
It was* of a large tree, as my board was to be
broad. I was three days in cutting it down, and
two more in lopping off the bows, and reducing^
it to a piece of timber. Thus I hacked and hew-
ed off each fide, till it became light to move; then
I turned it, made one side of it smooth and flat as
a board from end to .end, then turned it downwards-
cutting the other side, till I brought the plank to
be about three inches thick, and sinooth qn both
sides. Any body might judge my great labour and
fatigue in such a piece of work; but this 1 went
tnrough with patience, as also many other things
that my circumstances made necessary for me to dOr:
The harvest months, November, and December,:
were now at handy in which I had the pleasing*
prospect of a very good crop. But here! met
with a new misfortune'; for die goats and hare's,
having tasted of the sweetness of the blade, kept-
it so short, that it had no strength to shoot up in-
to a stalk. To prevent this, I inclosed it wither
hedge, and by day shot some of its devourers; and
my dog., which I had tied to the field-gate, keep-
ing barking all night, so frightened these creatures,'
that J got entirely rid of them. , .
But no sooner did I get rid of these, than, other;
enemies appeared, to wit, whole flocks of several
sorts of birds, who only waited till my back was
turned to ruin me. . So much did this provqke me,
that I let fly, and killed three of the malefactors;
and afterwards served them as they do notorious
thieves in England, hung them up in chains as a
terror to others. And indeed so good an effect had
this, that they not only forsook the corn,- but alL ,
that part of the island, so long as these criminals*
hung there. - j
%
My corn having ripened apace, the latter end
of December, which was my second fiarvest; £
reaped it with a scythe, made of one of my broad
swords, I had no fatigue in cutting down my first
crop, it was so slender. The ears I carried home
in a bajket, rubbing it out with my hands instead
of threshing it; and when my harvest was over,
found my half peck of feed produced near two
bushels of rice, and two bushels and a half of
barley. And now I plainly foresaw, that, by
God's goodness, I should be furnished with bread t
but yet I was concerned, because i knew not how
to grind or make meal of my corn, nor bread,*
neither knew how to bake it. I would not how-
ever taste any of the crop, but resolved to pre-
serve it against next season, and in the mean while
use my ijest endeavours to provide myself With
other food.
But where were my labours «to end? The want
of a plough to turn up the earth, or shovel to dig
rt, 1 conquered by making me a wooden spade:
the want of a hairtfw, I supplied myself with drag-
ging over the com a great bough of a tree. When
k was growing L was forced to fence it$ when
ripe to mow it, carry it home, thresh it, part it
from the chaff, and save it. And after all, I want-
ed a mill to igrind- it, sieve to dress it', yest and
salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it.
*Fbis set my brains on work to find some expedi-
ent for every one-of these necessaries against the
next,harvest.
And now hav/ing,more feed, my first *t;are was'
, to prepare'me more land. 1 pitched Upon two
large flat pieces of ground near my castk for that
purpose, in which I sowed my seed, and fenced it
with a good hedge. This took me up three months?
by which time the wet season coming on, and the
i-ain keeping me within doors, I fouhd' several oc-
- - • , Jf cafiofts
c^sipnsto employ myscjf; and while at work, used
to divert myself with talking to my parrot, learn-
ing him to know and speak his own name /V/, the
Jjrst welcome word I ever heard spoke in the island.
I "had been a Jong time contriving how to make
earthen vessels, which I wanted extremely; and
when I considered the heat of the climate, I did
notJoubt but if I could find any such clay, I rnight^
bqtch up a pot, strong enough when dried in the
spn to bear handling* and to hold any thing that
^ was-dry^ as corn, mea], and other things.
To be short," the clay I found; but it would oc-
casion the most serious person to smile to see what
auk>vard Ways I took, and what ugly mifhapen
things I made,? how many either sellout or crack-
ed by the violent heat of the fun, and self in pieces
^he,n th^y were removed; so that I think it wasr
two months time before I could perfect any-thing; <
and evei? theitbpt too slumsey things in imitation
of earthen jar^s.. These^however I very gently,
placed in wicker baskets, made on purpose fori
them, and between the pot and the balkets* stuf-
fed it-full of rice and barely straw: and these 1
presumed, wquld hold my dried corn, and perhaps
the meal/when the corn was bruised. As for the
smaller, things,! made them with better success;
foch as little round,pots, flat dishes, pitchers, arid
pipkinsi the fun baking them very hard.
Yet still I. wanted one thing absolutely necessa?'
ry, and that was an earthen pot^ not only to hold
my liquid, but also to bear the fire, which none
of these could do. It once happened, that as I
was putting out my fire, I found therein a broken
piece pi one of. my vessels burnt bard as a rock,
and red as a tile; This made me think of burning -
some pots; 4ind having no "notion of kiln, or of
'glazing them with lead, I fixed three large pi plans,'
and twoor three pots in a pUeone upon another*
The
^Tfie fire I piled round the outside, and dry -wood*
on the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red
hov and found that they did not crack at all; and
when I perceived them perfectly red* 1 let one of
them stand in the fire about five or fix hours, till
the clay melted by the extremity o£"the heat, and
would have run to glass, had I suffered it; upon:
twhich I flacked my fire by degrees till the redness*
abated; and watching them till the morning, vl
found I bad three very good pipkins, and two-
earthen pots, as well burnt and fit for roy turn a%
I could dfefire. '.
No joy could be greater than mine at this dis*
covery. For after this, I may-fay^ I wanted fdr
too sort of earthen Ware. I filled one of my pip-
kins with water to boil me some meat, which is
did admirably well, and with a piece of kid I made
in'e some,good bi*oth, as well as my circumstances
woukl afford nie at;, that time-
The next concern I had was to get me a fton&
Wortar to beat some corn in, instead of a mill to
grind it. Here indeed I was at a great loss, as not
being fit for a stone-cutter; and many days! spent
$b find &m a great stone big enough to cut hollow
^nd make fit for a mortar, and strong enough to-
bear -.the' weight of a pestil, that would break tfrd*
torn without filling it with sand. 'But.aH thfc stones
rofthe island being of ^ mouldering naturfc, i-en*
.dered my search fruitless; and then iVesolved to*
4ook Oiit^a^great^block of hard wood; Which havi%
soon found, I formed it With hy axs ^atid tammer>
^nd then with infinite labour made a hollow in it,,
tost is the Indians b? SraTtl make their caiioes/
When I had finished this, I made a great pistil" of
ir4n wood, and then kid them up against^ my sod-
ceeding harvest* .
My next business war to shake nife I siWe, to
•lift my,meal, and part it from the bimn and hufkV
Fa Having, ,
Havingno fine thin canvas to search the meal
through, I could not tell what to do. What linen
I had was reduced to rags: I had goats hair enoughs
but neither tools to work it, nor did I know how
to spin it: At length I remembered I had some
-neckcloths of callico or muflin of the sailors^ which
I had: brought out of the ship, and with these I
made tthree small sieves, proper enough.for the
work/1 .- .- * 
I come .now to consider the baking paYt. The
want of an oven I supplied by making some earthen
pans very broad, but not deep. Wherr I.had a
niindto bake, 1 made a great fire upon the hearth,
the tiles of which I made myself; and when the
wood was burnt int6 live coal9, I spread them
over it, .till it became very btit; then sweeping
them away, ;I set down my loaves, and whelming
down the earthen pots upon them, drew the alhes
andj coals all around the outside of the pots to con-
twae the heat; and in this manner I baked my
barley loaves, as well as if I had been a complete
pastry-cook, and alfa made of the rice, several
cakes and puddings. .,
It is no wonder, that all these -things took me '.
#up the best part of a; year, since what intermedia
ate time I had was bestowed in managing my new
harvest: and husbandry; for in the proper season I
reaped my <?orn, carried it home, and laid it up in
,th$ ear in my large baskets, tilM had tune to rub>
instead fof thresliing it.. And now indeed my corn
increased so much, that it produced me' about
twenty bushels of barley, and 3s much of rice^
that I n0t oaty began to use. it freely, but was
thinking how to enlarge my barns,, and resolved
to sow, q$. much;at aitime as .would be sufficient for.
meJbr a whole year.

This disappointment however idid riot frighten

I first cut down a cedar-tree, which wasfivfe
F 3; , fee£
feet ten inches diameter at the lower part next"
. the slump* and four feet eleven inches diameter at
the end-of twenty-two feet, after which itleflened
for a spaGCj and then parted into branches. Twen-
ty days was I hacking and hewing this tree at the
bottom^ fourteen more in cutting off the branches
and limbs, and a whole month in shaping it like
the bottom of a boat. As for the inside,. I was
three weeks with a mallet and chiffel, clearing it
t Jn such a manner, as that it was big enough to
r^ar^ry 26 men, much bigger than any canoe lever

yards fromjt^ To remedy the first inconvenience,,
which was a rising hill between this boat and the*
, creeks with wonderful pains and labour I duginto^
.the surface of the earth, and made a declivity. But
when this was done, all the strength-1 had was as
insufficient to" move it, as.it was when I attempted*
to move the boat. I then- proceeded to measure
the distance of grounds resolving to make-a canal,,
in order, touring the water to the canoe, since I
could not bring the canoe to the water.: But as
rthjs seemed, to be impracticable to myself alone,,
under- the space of eleven op twelve years, it
brought me into some fort of considerations so*
that I concluded this, also to be impossible, and the-
attempt altogether vain. L now saw, and not be>

At this time 1 did not fprget my anniversary;. but
Reptit; with rather greater devotion than before.

For now my hopes being frustrated, I looked upon
this world as a thing I had nothing to do with-.;
and very well might I fay, as father Abraham said
unto Dives, Between me and thee there is a gulph
fixed. And indeed I was separated from its wic-
kedness too, having neither the lust of the flesh,
the lust of the eye, nor the pride of life; I had
nothing to covet, being lord,.king, and emperor
over the whole country I had in my possesiTorf,
^without dispute, and without control: I had loacU
ings of corn, plenty of turtles, timber in abun-
dance, and grapes above measure. What was all
the rest to me? The money I had by me lay as
despicable dross, which I would freely have given
for a gross of tobacco pipes, or a hand-mill to
grind my corn: in a word, the nature and cxpe-
- rience of these things dictated to me this just re-
flection; That the good things of this world are
no farther good to usr than they are for our use;
and that whatever we may heap up to give others^
we can but enjoy as much as we use, and no more.
These thoughts rendered my mind more easy
than usual. Every time I sat down to meat, I did
it with thankfulness, admiring the providential
;hand of God who in,this wilderness had spread a
table ttt*me. And now I considered what I enjojs-
ed, rather than what I wanted; compared my pre^
sent condition with what I at first expected it should
be; how I stiQuld have done, if I had got nothing
out of the ship; That I must have perished before
I had caught-fifh or.turtles; or lived, had I found
them, like a*mere savage, by eating them,r^w,'
and pulling them in pieces with my claws, like a
.beast. I next compared my station to that which
I deserved; how undutiful I had been to'my pa-
rents; how destitute of the fear of God; hojtf void
of every thing that was good; and how ungrate-
ful for those abundant mercies. I had receivedfrom,
_ Heaven^

as.great as Elijah's being fed by ravens; and esist

I relinquished kll sadness, and gave way to con-

convert them to jackets.- To preserve my head*
I made me a cap of goat-skins, with the hair out-
wards to keep out the rain; which indeed served
me so well, that afterwards I made me a waistcoat
and open kneed-breeches of the fame: And then
I contrived a fort of an umbrella, covering it with
skins, which not only kept out the heat of the funy
but the rain also. Thus being easy and settleddri
my mind, my chiefest happiness was to converse
with God, in most heavenly and comfortable eja-
culations. » •
For five years after this I. cannot fay any extra-
ordinary thing occurred to me, My chief employ-
ment was to cure my raifins,and plant my barley
and rice, of both which 1 had a year's provision
before-hand. But though I was disappointed in
my first canoe, I made it, at intermediate times,
my business to make a second,'of much inferior,
size; and it was two years before I finished it.
But as I perceived it would nowise answer my de-
sign of sailing to the other more, my thoughts
were confined to take a tour round the island, to
see what further discoveries I could make. To this
intent, after having moved her to the water, and
tried how she would fail, 1 fitted up a little mast
to my boat, and made a; fail of, the ship's fail that
lay by me. I then made lockers or boxes at the
end of it, to put in necessaries, provisions, and
ammunition, which would preserve them dry ei-%
ther from rain, or the spray of the sea; and in the
inside of the froat, <I cut me a long hollow place
to lay my gun, and to keep it dry made a flag to
hangover it., My umbrella I fixed in a step in
the stern, like a mast, to keep the heat of the sun
qfsme. And now resolving to see, the circumfe-
rence of my little kingdom, I victualled my ship for
the voyage, putting in two dozen of my barley-
bread Iayes, an earthen j>ot full of parched rice,

|t little bottle df rum, half a goat, powder and
shot, and c\Voiwatch*cqats. It was the 6th of No-
vember, in the. 'sixth year of my reign, or capti*
vity, that I set out on this voyage, which was much
longer than 1 expected, being obliged to put far*
ther out, by reason of the rocks that lay a.great
^way in the sea. And indeed so much did these rocks
surprise sue, tl\at 1 was for putting back* fearing
that if I ventured farther, it would be out of rny
power to return: in this uncertainty I came to an
anchor just off shore, to which I waded with my
gun on ray slibulder, and then climbing up ,a hill,
which overlooked that points I saw the full .ektent
of it, and sol resolved to ri\n all hazards.* .
In this prospect froih the hill, I ^perceived a-vio-
lent current running to the east, coming A^ery close
£q the point; which I the more carefully observed^
„ thinking it dangerous, and that when I came to it,
I might be drove into the; sea by its force, and not
-able to return to the island? and *certainly it mufl
have been so, had I made this observation 5 for on
*the other side was the like current, with %his dis-
ferencre, that at set off \ar greater distance} antkl
perceived there *wa$ a strong e$dy under the land $
to that iriy shies businessi was to workiout of ;the
first current, and convehientlyrget into the eddy;
Two days.I staid here, the wind blowing vers
JbriftJy^E. S.>fe which being contrary tp the ctiiv
^fent, leaves a gr6at bfceach of the sea upontthe
qpoint 5 so it iwas iieitherfiti for tne^to keep too neat
tthe sliore'onaicohntaaf the breach; nbr stand at
too great a distance, for sear of the^streams. That
aright the wind abating, it grew sojcalm^nhdt t
veintured out $ and here I may be a monument to*
-all rash and ignorant pilots? For I twas no sooneir
rotae to the point, and not above theiboat^ length
from shore, but I was got into a de^p water with
•» current like a mill, which drove, my boat along
7 fa
so violently, that it was impossible for me to keep
her near the edge of it, but forced me more and
more out from the eddy to the left of me; and
all I could do with my padlers was useless, them
being no wind to help me.
Now I began to look upon myself as quite lost,
since as the current ran on both iides of the island,
1 was very certain they must join again, and then;
I had no hopes but of perifliingfor want in' the
spa, after what provision I had was spent, or be-*
'fore, if a storm sliould happen to arise. .
Who can conceive the present anguish of my
miftd atthis calamity? With longing eye§ did I
look upon my little kingdoms and thought the island
the pleasentest place in the universe. Happy, thrice
happy dejarty laid Iy shall I never see thee more?
Wretthed creature! whither ani I going? Why
did I murmur at my lonesome condition, when now
X would give the whole world to "be thither again?
While I was thus ctimplainirig, I found myself to
be driven about two leagues into the sea; how^
ever, I laboured till my strength was far spent, to:
keep my boat as far northas possibly I could, to
tjiat fide of the current where the eddy lay on,"
About noon I perceived a little breeze of wind,
spring up from the S. S. E. which overjoyed my:
heart; and i was still more elated, when, in about
Ijalf an hour, it blew a gentle fine gale. Hadanjb
thick weather sprung upy I had been lost another
way; foif having no compass on board, I should
never have fotfnd the way/to steer towards the1:
island, if once it had disappeared? but it proving
the contrary* I jet up my mast again, spread my?1
sail, and stoodiaway northward as much as 1 could»
to get rid of the current- And no sooner did the'
boat begin to stretch away, but I perceived by the;
dearness of the Watery a change of the current
was near,: for where it wa* strong, the water was
i foul4P
foul: and where it was clear, the current abated*
To the east; I soori saw, about half a mile, a breach-
of the sea upon some rocks, which caused it again,
to separate; and as the main force of it drove a Way
more southwardly, leaving the rocks to the north-
east, So the other came back by the repulse of the
rocks, making a sharp eddy, which returned back
again to the north-west with a very swift stream.
They who have experienced what it is to be re-
prieved 'upon the ladder, or to be saved from
tfreves just going to take away their lives, or such
as have been in the like calamities with my own,
may guess my present excess of joy* howieartily
I run my/boat into the stream of this eddy, and
how joyfully I spread my sail to the refreshing wind,
standing chearfuljy before it, with a smart tide un-
der foot. By the assistance of this eddy, I was
carried above a league home again, when being lit
the wake of the island, betwixt the two currents,
I found the water to be in a fort of a stand A-
bout four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached with-
in a league of the island, and perceived the points
of the rock, which caused this disaster, stretch-
ing out, as I observed before, to the southward,
which throwing oft the current more southwardly,
had occasioned another ed3y to the north. But
having a fair brisk gale, I stretched across this ed-
dy, and in an hour came within a mile-of theihore,
where I soon landed, to my unspeakable comfort;
and after an humble prostration, thanking God
for my deliverance, with a resolution to^ lay all
thoughts,of escaping aside, I brought my boat safe
to a'little cove, and laid me down to take a wel-
come repose.; When I awoke, I was considering
how I*might" get my"boat home; and coasting a-
long the shore, I came to a good bay, which r^an
, tip to a rivulet or brook, whe^e finding a safe har-
bour," I itowed her as safe as if ihe bad .been in a
dry diotk made on purpose for her. *
k.i now perceived myself not far from the place
where before I had travelled Sa foot; so taking
nothing ^vith me except my gun and umbrella, I
began my journey, and in the evening came to my
bowert where I again laid me down to rest. I
had not flept long before I was awakened in great
surprise, by a strange voice that called me several
times, Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe, poor Robin !
Where are you, Robin Crusoe? where are you?
where have you been?
So fast was *I asleep at first, that I did not a*
wake thoroughly, but half asleep and half awake,
I thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me^
But as the voice repeated Robinson Crusoe several
times, being terribly affrighted, I started up in
the utmost confusion; and no sooner were my eyes
fully open, but I beheld my pretty Poll sitting on
the top of the hedge, and soon knew that if wa^s
he that called me; for just in such bewailing lan-
guage I used to talk and teach him; which he so
exactly learned, that he would sit upon my,finger,
and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, Foot
Robinson Crusoe, where are you P where have you
been? how came you here? and such like prattle I
had constantly taught him. But even tho' I knew
it to be the parrotr it was a great while before I
could adjust myself; being amazed how the crea-
ture got thither, and that he should fix about that
place, and no where else. But now, being as-
sured it could be no other than my honest Poll,
my wonder ceased; and reaching out my hand, and
calling familiarly Poll, the creature came to me,
and perched upon my thumb, as he was wont, con-
stantly pratting to me, with Poor Robinson Crusoey
and how did I come here, and where had I been P
as if the bird was overjoyed to fee me; and so I
took him home along with me. t \ ,
1 was now pretty well cured of my rambling to
G sea j
sea; yet I could wish my boat* which had cost me
so much trouble a$id pains, on this side the island
once more, but which indeed .was impracticable.
I therefore began to lead a very retired life, living
near a twelve-month in a very contented manner,
wanting for nothing except conversation. As to
mechanic labours, which my necessities obliged me,
to, I fancied I could upon occasion make a tolerable
carpenter, were the poor tools I had to work with-
. al but good. Besides as I improved in my earth-
en ware, I contrived to make them with a wheel,
which I found much easier and better; making my
, work shapely, which before was rude and ugly.
But I think I was never so elevated with my owir
performance or project, than for being able to
make a tobacco-pipe; which tho' it proved an auk-
ward clumsy thing, yet it was Very sound, and
carried the smoke perfectly well, to my great sa-
tisfaction. . t . *
I also improved* my wicker-ware, making me a-
bundance of necessary baskets, which, though not .
very handsome, were very handy and convenient
to fetch things home in5 as also for holding my
stores, barley, rice, and other provisions.
My powder beginning to fail, made me examine
after what manner 1 mould kill the goats or birds
to live on, after it was all-gone. Upon which I
contrived many ways to ensiiare the goats, and
fee if I%could catch them alive, particularly a slie-
goat with young* At last I tiad my desire: for
making pit-falls and traps baited with barley and
rice, I found one morning in one of them an old
•he-goat, and in the other thr^e kids, one male,
the other two females.
Sq boisterous was the old one, that I could riot
bring him away. But I forgot the old proverb,
Thai hunger will tame a lion: for had I kept him
three or four days without victuals, and then given
en him some water with a little corn, he would
have been as tame as1 a young kids: The other crea-
tures I bound with strings together; but I had great
difficulty before I could bring them to my* habita-
tion. It was some time before they would feed;
but throwing them sweet corn, it so much tempted
them that they began to be tamer; from hence I
concluded, that if I designed to furnish myself with
goats fieffi, when my ammunition was spent, the
tamely breeding them up, like a flock of sheep, a-
bout my settlement, was the only method I could
take. I concluded also I mult separate the wild
from the tame, or else they would always run
wild as they grew up; and the best way for this,
was to have some inclosed piece: of ground well
fenced, either with hedge pr pale, to keep them so
effectually, that those within might not break out,
or those without break in. Such an undertaking
was very great for. one pair of hands? but as there
was an absolute necessity for doing it; my first care
was to find a convenient piece of ground where
there was likely to be herbage for them to eat,
wa^er to drink, and cover to keep _them from the
fun.
Here again I gave'another instance of my igno-
rance and inexperience, pitching upon a piece of
meadow land so large, that had I inclosed it, the
hedge or pale must have been at least two miles a-
bout. Indeed had it been ten miles, I had time
enough* to do it in: but then I did not consider
that my goats would be as wild in so much com-
pass, a,s if they had had the whole island, and con-
sequently as difficult for' me to catch them. This*
thought came into my head, after I had carried it.
on, I believe, about fifty yards: I therefore al-
tered my scheme, and resolved to inclose a .piece
bf ground about 150 yards in length, and iqo in
breadth, sufficient enough for as many-as would
G z maht*
maintain me till such time as my flock increased,,
and then I could add more ground. I now vigor-
ously prosecuted my work, and it took me about
three months in hedging the first piece; in which
time I tethered the three kids in the best part of it,
feeding them as near me as possible, to make them
familiar: and indeed I very often would carry
some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed
them out of my hand; by which they grew so tame,
that when my inclosure.was finished,, and I had let
them loose, they would run after me for a hand-
ful of corn. This indeed answered my end; andt
in a year and a half's time I had a flock of about
twelve goats, kids and all; and In two years af-
ter, they amounted to forty-three, besides what
I had taken and killed for my sustenance* After-
which I inclosed five several pieces of ground to
feed them in, with pens to drive them into, that I
might take them as I had occasion.
.J. *i,*j»-project jl likewise found acunnoriai bleK
sings, for I not only had plenty of goats flesh, but
v milk too, which in my beginning I did h6t so much
as think of." And indeed, though I never had milk-
ed a cow, much-less a goat, or seen butter or
cheese made, yet, after some essays and miscar-
riages, I made me both, and never afterwards
wanted.' :. -
.How mercifully can the Omnipotent Power com-
fort his creatures, even lit the midst ,of their
greatest calamities? How can he sweeten the bit-
terest providences, and give us reason to magnify
him in dungeons and prisons? What a bounteous
table was here spread in a wilderness for me, where
I expected nothing at first but to perish for hunger?
s •' Certainly a Stoic would have smiled to have seen
me at dinner. There fat my royal majesty, an ab-
solute prince and ruler of my kingdom, attended
bpmy dutiful subjects, whom, if I pleased, I could
*.'.* either
cither hang, draw, quarter, give them liberty, or
take it away. When I dined, I seemed a king,,
eating alone, none daring to presume to do so Hill
I had done. Poll, as if he had been my principal-
court-favourite, was the only person permitted to
talk with me* * My old but 'faithful dog, now
grown exceeding crazy, and who had found no
species to multiply his kind upon, continually fat
on my right hand; while my two cats fat on each:
side of the table, expecting a bit from my hand, as
a principal mark of my royal favour. These _
were not the cats I had brought from the ship £
they had been dead long before, and interred near *
my habitation by mine own hand;. But one of ttipm,,
as*l suppose, generating with a wild cat, a couple
of their young I had made tame;. the rest run
wild into the woods, and in time grew so impu-
dent as. to- return, and .plunder me of my stores,. .
tilHuch time as I shot a great many,* and the reft
left me without troubling me any more. In this,
plentiful manner did I live, wanting for nothing
but conversation. One thing indeed concerned'
me, the want of my boat; I knew not which way
to get her round the island. One time I resolved to
go along the shore by land to her-; but had any
one in England met such a figure, it woiikLeither
have affrighted them, or made them burst irito^
laughter: nay, I could not but smile myself at*
my habit, which I think in this place will be very
-proper to describe. *
- The cap I wore upon my head was great, htghy
and shapeless,, made of a goat's skin, with a flap;
or pent-house hanging down behind^ not only to
keep the sun from me^ but to shoot the rain off:'
from running into my neck, nothing being more
pernicious than, the rain falling upon the flesh in
these climates- I bad a short jacket of goats skin,,
whose.hair hung dawn such a. length on either side,-
G^ / that.
that it reached down to the calves of my legs. As
for shoes and stockings, I had none, but made a
resemblance of somethings I know not what to
call them; they were made like buskins, and laced
on the sides like spatterdashes, barbarously shaped
like the rest of my habit. I had a broad belt of
goats skin dried, girt round me with a couple of
thongs, instead of buckles; on each of which, to
supply the deficiency of sword and daggers hung
. my hatchet and saw* I had another belt, not so
broad yet fastened iiithe samemanner, which hung
over my shoulder, and at the end of it, under my
left arm hung two pouches, made also of goats
ikin, to hold my powder and shot. My basket I
carried on my back, and iny gun on my shoulders
• and over my head a great clmnfey ugly goat-skin ^
umbrella,, which, however next to my gun, was*
the most necessary thing about me* As for my
face, the colour was not ib swarthy as the Mulat-
toes, or as might have been expected from one
who took so little care of it, in a climate within
nine" or ten degrees of the Equinox. *At one time^
my beard grew so long that it hung down above as
quarter of a yard; but as 1 had both razors and:
seissars in store, I cut it all off, and suffered none
to grow, except a large pair of Mahometan whis-
kers* the like of which I had seen worn by some
Turks at Sallee, not long enough indeed to hang
* a hat upon, but of such a monstrous-size, as, would*
have amazed aiiy in England to have seen.
But all this'was of no consequence heret there-
being none tq observe my behaviour or habit. And:
so without fear, and without control, I proceeded
on my journey, the prosecution of which took me
up five or six days. I first travelled along the sea-
iliore, directly to the place where I first brought,
my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks; but.
having now no boat to take care of,, 1 went over
"* •' larid:
land 9 nearer way tcrthe same height that I was
before upon; when looking forward to the point
of the rock, which lay out,., and which I was for-
ced-to double with my boat, I was amazed tosee
the sea so smooth and quiet, there being no ripling
m otion, nor current any more than in other places,.
This made me ponder some time to guess the rea-
son of it, when at last I was convinced, that the;
ebb setting from the west, and joining with the
current of water from some great river on shore,
must be the occasion of these rapid streams; and
that consequently, as the winds ble^w more west-
wards, or more southwardly, so the current came
the nearer, or went the farther from shore. Tp
satisfy my curiosity, 1 waited there till evening,
when the time of ebb being made, I plainly per-
ceived from the rock the current again as beforey
- with this difference, that it ran farther off, near
half a league from the shore j whereas, in my ex-^
pedition,, it set close ivpon it, furiously hurrying
me and my canoe along with it, which at another.
..time it would not have done. And now I was
convinced, that, by observing the ebbing and flow-
ing of the tide, I might easily bring my boat round
the^island again. :But when I ;began to think of.
putting it in practice, the remembrance of tlfe late
danger struck me with such horror, that I changed
my resolution, and formed another, which was
more safe, though more laborious; and this was
, to make another canoe, and so have one for cme
side of the island,, and Qne for the other.
\I had now two plantations in the island,; the
first -my little fortification* f°rti or castle, with;
many large and spacious improvements: for by
this time I had enlarged the cave behind me with
- several little caves, one within another, to hold
my baskets, corn, and straw. The piles with
-which I made my wall y/ere grown so lofty and
great
» "great as obscured ray habitation. And near^ this*
commodious and pleasant-settlement, lay my well
cultivated and improved corn fields, which kindly
yielded me its fruit in the proper season. My se-
cond plantation was that near* my country-feat, or
little bower, where my grapes flourished, and
where having planted many stakes, Lmade inclo-
sures for my goats, so strongly fortified by labour
and time, that it was much stronger than a wallt
and consequently imposliblefor them to-break thro'.
As for my bower itself, I kept it constantly in re- ,
pair, and cut the trees in such a manner as made
them grow thick and wild^-and form a most de-
lightful shades In she centre of this stood my tent,
thus erected: I had driven four piles in the ground, ,
spreading over it a piece of the ship's sail; be-
neath which I made me a sort of couch, with the-
skins of the creatures I had slain, and other things;,
and having laid therepn one of the sailor's blank-
ets, which I had saved from,the wreck of the shipr
and covering myself with a great watch*coat, I;
took up this place for my country retreat.
Very frequently from this settlement did I use*
to visit my boat, and kept her in very good order;.
And sometimes I would venture in her a, cast or
two from shore,, but no farther,, lest either a strdng^
currents a sudden stormy wind, or some unlucky ac-
cident, should hurry me from the island, as before.^
-But now I intreat your attention, whilst J pro-;'
ceed to inform you of a new, but most surprising;
scene of life which here befell me.
You may easily suppose, .that, after having beeii,
here so long, nothing could be more amazing than;
to see a human creature; ^ One day- it happened*,
that going to my boat, I saw the print of a man's
naked foot on themore, very evident on the sand, as,
the toes, heels, and every part of it* Had I seen an;
apparition in the most frightful mape^I could, not
haven*
have been more confounded. My willing ears
gave the strictest attention, I cast my eyes around,
but could satisfy neither the one or the other* I
proceeded alternately to every part of the ihpre, _
but with equal effects neither could I fee any o-
ther mark, tho' the sand about it was as suscepti-.
ble to take impression, as that which was so plainly
stamped. Thus struck with confusion and horror,
I returned to my habitation, frightened at every
bush and tree, taking every thing for men; and pos-
sessed with the wildest ideas! That night my eyes
never closed* I formed nothing but thfe most dis-
mal imaginations-, concluding it must be the mark
of the devil's foot which I had seen. For other-
wise how could any mortal come ta this island?
Where was the ship that transported them? and
what signs* of any other footsteps? Though these,
seemed very strong reasons for such a supposition,
yet (thought I) why fhouidthe devil make the pnAt
of his foot to no ptirp;:s*j 21 I can fee, when he
might have takeii other ways to have terrified me?
Why should he leave his mark on the other side of
the ifla'nd, and that too on the sand, where the
surging waves of the ocean might foots have erased
the impression. Surely this action is ndt consist-
ent With the subtilty of Satan, said I to myself, but,
rather must be some dangerous creature, .some
wild savage of the main land over-against me, that
venturing too far in the ocean, has been driven
here$ either by the violent currents, or contrary-
winds; and not caring to stay on this desolate
liUnd* has gone back to sea again.
Happy indeed, thought I to .myself, that none of
the savages had seen me in that place: yet I wa$
not altogether without fear, lest, having found my
bpat, they ssiould reiurn in numbers and devour
me,- or atileatt earry away all my cornr and des-
troy my flock of tame goats: in a word* all my
religious
religious hopes vanished, as though I thought God
could not now protect pie by his power, who had
so wonderfully preserved me so long.
What various chains of providence are there in
the life of man? How changeable are our affections,
according to different circumstances? We love to-
day what we hate to-morrow; we shun one hour
what we seek the next. This was evident in me
in the most conspicuous manner: for I, who before
Jiad so much lamented my condition, in being ba-
nished from all human-kind, was now even ready
to expire, when I Considered that a rnan had set
his foot on this desolate island; But when I consi-
dered my station of life, decreed by the infinitely
wise and good providence of God; that I ought
not to dispute my Creator's sovereignty, who had
an undoubted right to govern and dispose of his
creatures as he thinks convenient; and that his
justice zvA mej'cy could either punish or deliyer
me: I fay, when I considered all this, I comfort-
ably found it my duty to trust sincerely in him,
pray ardently to him, and humbly resign myself to
% nis divine will.
One:morning,-lying"on my bed, these words of
the sacred writings came again into my mind, Call
upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver ,
thee, and thou/halt glorify me. Upon this sentence^
rising more chearfully from my bed, I offered up
my prayers in the most heavenly manner: and
when I had done, taking up my Bible to read, these
words appeared first in my sight: Wait o'n the Lord,
and he" of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy
heart: Wait, I say, on%ihe Lord. Such divine com-
fort did this give me, as to reniove all cause of
sadness upon that occasion.
Thus, after a world of apprehensions and fears,
for three days and nights, I at last ventured out
of my castle, and milked my goats, one of which
'*' . .' was-.
was almost spoiled for want of it. I next (though
in great fear) visited my bower, and milked my
flocks there also; when growing bolder,, I went
down to the shore again,, and measuring the print
of the foot to mine, to see perhaps whether I my-
self had not occasioned that mark, I found it much
superior in largeness; and so returned home, now
absolutely convinced, that either some men had
been ashore, or that the island must be inhabited;
and therefore that I might be surprised before 1
wai aware.
I now began to think of/providing for my secu-
rity, and revolved in my mind many different
schemes for that purpose: I first pr©poscd to cut
down my inclosures, and turn my tame cattle
wild into the woods, that the enemy might not
find them, and frequent the island in hopes of kil-
ling the fame. Secondly, I was for digging ,up my
corn-fields for the very fame reason. And, Lastly,
I concluded to demolisli my bower, lest seeing a
place of human contrivance, they might come far-
ther, and find out and attack me in my little castle.
Such notions did the fear of danger suggest to
me; and I looked, I thought, like the unfortunate
king Saul, when not only oppressed by the Phili-
stines hut also forsaken by God himself. And it is
strange, that a little before, having entirely resign-
ed myself to the will of God, I should now have so
little confidence in him, fearing those more who
could kill this fading body, than he who could de-
stroy my immortal foul. . , --.
Sleep was an utter stranger to my eyes that
night; yet nature spent and tired, submitted to a
silent repose the "next morning. And then, join-
ing reason with my fear, I considered, that this
delightful and pleasant island might not be sq en-
tirely forsaken as I might think; but that the im
habitants from the other shore might fail either
* -' With
with design, or from necessity, by> cross winds;
and if the latter circumstance, I had reason to be-
lieve they would departthe first opportunity. How-
ever, my fear made me think of a place for retreat
upon an attack, I now repented that I had made
my door to come out beyond my fortification; to
remedy which, I resolved to make me *a second
one: I fell to work, therefore, and drove betwixt
that double row of trees, which I planted about
twelve years before, severaHfrong piles, thicken-
ing it with pieces of timber and old cables* and
strengthening the footof.it with earth which I
dug out of my cave; I also made me seven holes,
wherein I planted my muskets like cannon, fitting
them into frames resembling carriages. This be-
ing finished with indefatigable industry, for a great
Way every where, I planted slicks of qfier like a
wood, about twenty thousand of them, leaving a
large space between them and my wall, that I might
have room to see an enemy, and that they might
not be -sheltered among the young trees, if they
offered to approach the outer wall. And indeed
scarce two years had passed over my head, whejti
there appeared a lovely sliady grove, and in fix
years it became a thick wood perfectly impassible.
For my safety I left no avenue to go in or out;
instead of which I set two ladders, one to a part
of the rock which was low, and then broke in£
leaving room to place another, ladder upon that;
so .that when*!" took those down, it was impossible
for any man to descend without hurting himself;
and if they had, they would still be at the outside
of my outer wall. But while I took all these mea-
sures of human prudence for my own preservation^ -
I was 'hot .altogether unmindful of other affairs.
To, preserved my slock of tame goats, that the
enemy should not take all at once, I looked out for
the most retired part of the island, which was the
/ % * place
place where I had lost myself before mentioned, and
there finding a clear piece of land, containing three
acres, surrounded with thick woods, I wrought fa
hard, that, in less than a month's time, I fenced
it so well round, that my flocks were very well se-
cured in it, and 1 put therein two he goats and ten
ilie ones.
All this labour was occasioned purely by fear-
ful apprehensions, on account of seeing the print
of a man's foot. And not contented yet with what
I had done, I searched for another place towards
the west point of the island, where I might also
retain another flock. Then wandering on this er-
rand more to the west of the island than ever I had
yet done, and casting my eyes towards the sea, nie-
thought I perceived a boat at a great distance;
but could not possibly tell what it was for want of
my perspective glass. I considered that it was no
strange thing to fee the print of a man's foot;
and, concluding them cannibals, blessed God for
my being cast on the other (ide of the island, where
none of the savages, as I thought, ever came. But
when I came down the hill to the more, which was
the S. W. point of the island, I was soon confirm-
ed in my opinion; nor can any one describe my
horror and amazement, when I saw the ground
spread with sculls, hands, feet, and bones of hu-
man bodies; and particularly I perceived a space
like a circle, in the midst of which had been a sire,
afcout which I conjectured these wretches fat, and
unnaturally sacrificed and devoured their fellow-
creatures.
The horror and loathsomeness of this dreadful
spectacle, both confounded my senses, and made
me discharge from my stomach in an excessive man-
ner. 1 then returned towards my habitations and
fcin my way thither shedding floods of tears, and
falling down on my bended knees, gave God thanks
- H for
for, making my nature contrary to these wretches,
t and delivering me so long out of their hands.
Though reason and my long residence here had
assured me, that these savages never came up to
the thick woody parts of the country, and that I
had no reason to be apprehensive of a discovery ; *
yet such an abhorrence did I still retain, that for
two years after I confined myself only to my three
plantations; I mean my castle, country feat, and
inclosure in the woods. And though in process of
time, my dreadful apprehensions began to wear
away, yet my, eyes were more vigilant for fear of
being surprised, and I was very cautious of firing
my gun, lest being heard by those creatures, they
mould vproceed to attack me. I resolved, how-
ever, manfully to lose ray life if they did, and,
went armed w'th three pistols stuck in my girdle;
which, added to the-description I have given of my-
self before, made me look with a very formidable
appearance.
Thus my circumstances for some time remained
-very calm and undisturbed; and when 1 compared
my condition ;to others, 1 found it was far from
being miserable. And indeed would "all persons
compare their, circumstances, not with those above
them, but with those innumerable unhappy ob-
jects beneath them, Lam sure we should not hear
those daily murmurings and complainings that,are
in the world. For my part, I wanted but few
things. Indeed the terror which the savages had
put me in, spoiled some inventions for my own
conveniences. One of my projects was to brew
nie some beer; a very whimsical one indeed, when
it is considered, -thaxt I had neither casks sufficient,
nor could I make any to preserve it in; neither
had I hops to make it keep, yest to make it work,
nor a copper or kettle to make it boil. Perhaps,
;indeed, after some years, I might bring'this to'
bear.
Sear, as I had done other things. But now my
inventions were placed another way 5 and day and *
night I could think of nothing but how I might
destroy some of these cannibals, when proceeding
to their bloody entertainments; and so saving a'
Tictim froin being sacrificed, that he might after
become my servant. Many were my contrivan-
ces for this purpose, and as many more objections
occurred, after I had hatched them. I once con-
trived to-dig a hole under the place where they 
made their fire, and put therein five or six pounds
of gun-powder, which would consequently Iflow
up all those that were near it; but their I was loath
to spend so much upon them, lest it should not do
that certa'n execution I could desire; and but on-
ly affright, and not kill them. Having laid this
design aside, I again proposed-to myself to lye"
privately in afnbuÆr, in some* convenient place,
with my three gtmfe double loaded, and let fly at
them in the midst of their dreadful ceremony;
and having killed two or three of them at every
shot, fall upon the rest suddenly with 'my three
pistols, and not let one mother's son escape. This
imagination pleased my fancy so-much; that I used
to dream of it in the night-time^ To put my de-
sign in execution, I was not long seeking for a
, place very convenient for my purpose, where un-*
seen I might behold every action of the savages.
'Here I placed my two muskets, each of which was\
loaded with a brace of slugs, and four or five
smaller bullets about the size of ^pistol bullets;
the fowling-piece was charged with near a handful
of the largest swan shot; and m every pistol were
about four bullets. And tlftis all things being pre-
pared, no sooner would th£ welcome light spread
over the element, but like a giant refrefljed with-
miine, as the scripture has it, would I issue forth
from my castle, and from a.lofty hill, three miles
H 2 distant^
88 L IF E a sr» A 1> V E NT\JK%S
distant, View if I could fee any invaders approach
unlawfully to my kingdom. But having waited in
vain two or three months, it not only grew very
, tiresome to me, but brought me into some consider*
ation, and made me examine myself, what right:
1 had to kill these creatures in this manner : »
If (argued I to myself) this unnatural custom of
theirs be a fin offensive to Heaven, it belongs to
the Divine Being, who alone has the vindictive
power in his hands, to shower down his vengeance
upon them. And perhaps he does so, in making
them become one another's executioners. Or, if
not, if God thinks these doings just, according to
the knowledge they conceive, what authority have*
I to pretend to thwart the decrees of Providence^
which has permitted theft actions for so many agesi
perhaps frojn almost the beginning of the creation?
They never offended me, what right have I then
to concern myself in their shedding one another's
blood? And indeed I have since known,,they va-
lue no more to kill and devour a captive taken in
war, then we do to kill an ox, or eat muttom I
then concluded, it necessarily followed, that these
people were no more murderers than Christians,
who many times put whole troops to the swords
after throwing down their arms. Again I confix
dered, that if 1 fell upon them, I should be as much
in the wrong as the Spaniards, who had commit-
ted the greatest barbarities upon these people who
never had offended them in their whole lives; as
if the kingdom of Spain was eminent for a race of
men without common compassion to the miserable^
a" principal sign of the most generous temper*
These considerations made me pause,.and brought
me to think I had taken wrong measures in my re-
solution; I now argued with myself, that it was
better for me never to attack, but to ^remain jun-
discovered as long as poffibly I could j that an* op-
posite
posite conduct would certainly prove destructive ;:
for as it was scarcely to be supposed 1 could kill
them all, I might either be overpowered by the? -
remaining, or that some escaping, might bring" ~
thousands to my certain destruction. And indeed •
religion took their part so much as to convince m&''
how contrary it was to my duty to be guilty of
shedding human blood, innocent as to my particu- -
lar, whatever they are to one another; that I had*
nothing to do with it, but leave it to the God of*
• all power and dominion, as I said before, to dpr *
therein what seemed convenient to his- heavenly
wisdoms And therefore on my knees I thanked* <
the Almighty for delivering me from blood-guiltier*
'ness, and "begged h;s protection that I might-neverv
fall into their hands*-..
Thus giving over an attempt which*J had rashly r
begun,,! never ascended the hill on that occasion *
afterwards; I only removed my boat, which lay on
the other fide of the island; and every thing that.,
belonged to her, towards the east, into a little cove,:,
that there might not be the least shadow of disco-. -
very of any boat near, or habitation upon. the €
island. - My castle then became my cell, keeping,
always retired in it, except when I went out to •
milk my she-goats, and order my little flock in the*
wood; which was quite out of danger; for sure:
Liwas, that these savages never came here with*,
expectations to fred-any thing, and consequently .*
never -wandered from the-coast: hdweverj-as they-.'
might have several times been on shore as. well-be-
fore as after, my dreadful apprehensions, I looked *
back with horror to think in what state J might j
have been, had I suddenly met~them slenderly arm-
ed, with one gun xmly4oaded with small shot; and
, how great would have been my amazement, if in-.-
stead of seeing the print of one, man's foot, I rad A
perceived fifteen or twenty, savages,, wh? ha*, hip- -.••

once set their eyes upon me, by the the swiftness
of their feet, would have left me no possibility of
escaping? These thoughts would link my very foul,
so that I would fall into a deep melancholy, till
such time as. the consideration of my gratitude to
the Divine Being moved it from my heart. I then
fell into a contemplation of the secret springs of
providence; and how wonderfully we are deliver-^
ed, when insensible of it; and when intricated uv
uncertain mazes or labyrinths of doubt or hesita-
tion, what secret hint directs us in the right way,
when we intended to go out of it; nay, perhaps,
, contrary to our business, fense, or inclination. U~
pan which, I fixed within me this as a certain rule,,
never to disobey those secret impressions of mind
to the acting or not acting any thing that offered,,
for which I yet could assign no reason. But let
it be how it will, the advantage of this conduct
very eminently appeared in the latter part of my
abode on this island: I am a stranger in determin-
ing whence these secret intimations of Providence
derive* yet methinks they arenotonly some proof
of the converse of spirits, but also of the secret
communications they ^re supposed to have with
> those that have not palled through the gloomy vale
of death, *
These anxieties of mind, and the care of my^
preservation, put a period to all future inventions,
and contrivances, either for accommodation or con*
venience; I now cared not to drive a nail, chop a
stick, fire a gun, or make a fire, lest either the:
noise should he heard*, or the smoke discover me.
^ind on this account! used to burn my earthen
ware privately in a cave which I found in thej:
wood, and which I made convenient for that pur-
pose; the principal cause that brought me here was-
to make charcoal, so that I might bake and dress,
my bread and meat without any danger. At that
time'
time a curious accident happened me/which I
shall now relate.
While I was cutting down some wood for ma-
king my charcoal, I perceived a cavity behind' a<
very thick branch of underwood. Curious to look
into it, I attained its mouth, and perceived it sufe
ficient sot4 me to stand upright in it. But when I*
had entered, and took a further view, two rollings
shining eyes, like flaming stars, seemed to dars
themselves at me; so that I made all the haste out
that I could, as not knowing whether it was the de-
vil or a monster that had taken his residence in that
place. When I recovered a little from my surprise,.
I called myself a thousand fools, for being afraidi
to see the devil one moment, who had now almost
lived twenty years in the most retired solitude*
And therefore resuming all the courage I 1 ad, I
took up a flaming fire-brand, and in I rushed agaim
ihad not proceeded above three steps when I wa&
more affrighted than before;, for then I heard a ve-
ry loud sigh, like that of a human creature in the
greatest agony, succeeded with a broken noise, re-
£erabling~ words half expressed^ and then a broken
sigh again. Stepping back, Lord! (thought I to*
myself,) where am I got? Into what inchanted-
place have I plunged myself, such as are reported*
to contain miserable captives, till death puts an^
end to their sorrow? And indeed, in such a great*
amazement was If that it struck me into a cold-
sweat; and had my hat been on my head,, I believe'
my hair would have moved it off. But again en-!
couraging myself with the hopes of God's protec-
tion, I proceeded forward* and, by^the light of
my firebrand, perceived it to be a monstrous he-
goat, lying on the ground gasping for life; and
dying of mere old age. At first I stirred him, think-
ing to drive him out, and the poor ancient crea*
ture strove to get upon his feet3 but was not able;
so
soTe'en let him lie sti'l, to a Fright the -savages*
should they venture into this cave, I now look-
ed round me, and found the place but small and
shapeless*. At the farther fide^of it I perceived a'
fort of an entrance, yet so low, as must'oblige me*
to creep on stiy hands and^knees to it; so, having
no candle, I suspended my enterprise till die next
day, and then I came provided with two large ones
. of my own making*
Having crept upon my hands and feet through?
this strait,! found the roof rose higher up,, I think?
about twenty feet. But surely never mortal saw
such a glorious light before! The roof and walls
of this cave reflected a hundred thousand lights to-
me from my two candles, as though they were in,-*
dented with stiining gold, precious stones, or spark-:
ling diamonds. And indeed it was the most delight-:
•fill cavity or grotto of its kind that could be desi-*
red, though entirely dark. The floor was dry;
and levels and had a kind of gravel upon it; no?
nauseous venomous creatures to- be seen there,:
neither* any damp or wet about it* I could find no»
fault but in the. entrance,-and. 1 began to think
that even this might be very necessary for my de-:
fence* and therefore resolved to make it my most:
principal magazine/ I brought hither two fowl-
ing pieces, and three muskets^ leaving only five>
pieces at my castle, planted in the nature of can-*
non. Ina barrel of gunpowder, whrch I,tookup^
out of. the sea, I brought away about sixty pounds:
of good powder, which were not damaged; and;
these, with.a.great quantity of lead for bullets, h
removed from my castle to this retreats now so ra-
tified both by art and nature/
1 fancied myself now like one of the giants of*
old^ who were said to live in caves and holes a->
naqngthe rocks,- inaccessibleto any but themselves,!
or, at leasts most dangerous to attempt. . And now/
I despised
I despised both the cunning and strength of the
savages, either to find me out, or to hurt me.
But I must not forget the old goat, who caused
my late dreadful amafcement. The poor creature
gave up the ghost the day after my discovery 5" and
it being very difficult to drag him him out, I dug
his grave, and honourably intombed him in the
fame place where he departed, with as much cere*
mony as any Welch-goat that has been interred a*
bout the high mountain Penmcnmoure.
I think I was now in the twenty^third year of
my reign, and my thoughts much easier than for-
merly, having contrived several pretty amuses-
ments and diversions to pass away the time in a
pleasant manner. By this time my pretty Poll had
learned to speak English, and pronounce his words
very articulately and plain; so that for many hours
we used to chat together after a very familiar man*
jier, and he lived with me no less than twenty-six
years. My dog, who was nineteen years old, fist-
teen of which he lived with me, died sometime a»
go of mere old age. As for my cats, they multi-
plied so fast, that I was forced to kill or drive
them into the woods, except two or three, which
became my particular favourites. Besides these,
I continually kept two or three household kids a-
bout me, whom I did learn to feed out of my hand^
and two more parrots who could talk indifferent-
ly, and call Robinson Crusoe, but not so excel-
lently as the first, as not taking that pains with
them. I had also several sea-fowls which I had
wounded and cut their wings; and growing tame,
they used to breed among the low trees about my
castle walls; all which njade my abode very agreed-
able.
But what unforeseen events suddenly destroy* the
enjoyments of this uncertain state of life, when
-we least expect thejn! It was now the month of
December,
December, in the southern solstice, and partscir-
lar time of my harvest, which required my atten-
dance ixi the fields; when going out pretty early
one morning, before it was day-light, there ap*
peared to me, from the.sea-shore, a flaming lights
about two miles from me, at the east end of the
island, where 1 had observed some savages had been
before, not on the other side, but to my great af-
fliction it was on my fide of the island.
Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual
apprehensions, that the savages would perceive my
improvements, I returned directly to my castle^
pulled up the Jadcler after me, making all things
look as wild and natural as poslibly I could. In
the next place, I put myself in a posture of de-
fence, loading my muskets and pistols, and con>
mjtting myselr to God's protection, I resolved to
defend myself till my last breath. Two hours af-
ter, impatient for intelligence, I set my ladder up
to tjae side of the hill, where there was a flat
place, and then pulling the ladder after me, ascendr
ed to the top, where laying myself on my belly^.
with my perspective glass I perceived no less than
nine naked savages sitting round a small fire, eat-
ing, as I supposed, human fleslif with their two
canoes haled on sliore, waiting for the flood to
carry them off again. You cannot easily express
the consternation I was-in at this sight, especially
seeing them near me; but when I perceived their
coming must be always with the current of the ebby
I became more easy in my thoughts^ being very
fully convinced, that I might go abroad with secu-
rity all the time of flood, is they were not before
landed. And, indeed this proved just as I imagined;
for no sooner dui they all take boat and paddle a-
way, but the tide made N. W. Before they went
off they danced, making ridiculous postures and'
gestures,, for above .an hour, all stark naked.; but
* whether.
**»
^whether men or women, or both, I could not per-'
ceive. When I saw them gone, I took two guns
upon my moulders, and placing a couple of pistols
in my belt, with my great sword hanging by my
side, I went to the hill, where at first I made a
discovery of .these cannibals, and then saw there
had been three canoes more of the savages on more
at that place, which, with the rest, were making
over, to the main land.
But nothing could be more horrid to me, when
going to the place of sacrifice, the blood, the bones,
^ind other mangled parts of human bodies appear-
ed, in my fight: and so fired was I with indigna-
tion, that I was fully resolved to be revenged on
the first that ca'me there, though I ,lost my life in
the, execution. It then appeared to me, that the
visits, which they make to this island are not very
frequent, it being fifteen months before they came
again: but still I was very uneasy, by reason of
the dismal apprehensions I had of their surprising
"me unawares: nor dared I offer to fire a gun on
that side of the island, where they used to appear,
lest taking the alarm, the savages might return
with, many hundred canoes", and then God knows
in what manner I should have made my end. Thus'
was I a year or mdre before I saw any of these
devouring cannibals again.
But to wave this, the following accident, which
demands attention, for a while, eluded the force
of my thoughts in revenging myself on those Hea-
thens.
*' Pn the 16th of May (according to my wooden
'calender) the wind blew exceeding hard, accompa-
nied with abundance of lightening and thunder all
day, and succeeded by a very stormy night. The
seeming anger of the heavens made me have re-
course to my Bible: Whilst I was seriously pon-
dering upon dt, I was suddenly alarmed with the
'' noise
* "• •' < *
H. -
noise of a gun, which I conjectured was fired upon
the ocean. Such an unusual surprise made me fWt
up in a minute, when with my ladder ascending the
mountain as before, that very moment a flash of
fire presaged the report of another gun, which I
presently heard, and found it was from that part
of the sea where the current drove me away. I
could not but then think, that this must be a ship
in distress, and that these were the melancholy sig-
nals for a speedy deliverance. Great indeed was my
sorrow upon this occasion; but my labours to assist
them must have proved altogether vain and fruit-
less. However, I brought together all the dry
wood that was at haiid, and making a pretty large
pile, set it on fire on the hill. I was certain they
plainly perceived it, by their firing another gun
as soon as it began to blaze, and after that seve-
ral more from the same quarter. All night long
I kept up my fire: and when the air cleared up, I
perceived something a great way at sea, directly E.
but could not distinguish what it was, even with
my glass, by reasori the weather was so very fog~
gy out at sea. However, keeping my eyes direct-
ly fixed upon it,.and perceiving it not to stir, I
presently concluded it must be a ship at anchor, and
so very hasty I was to be satisfied, that taking my
gun, I went to the S. E. part of the island, to the
fame rocks where I had been formerly drove away
by the current; in which time the weather being
perfectly cleared up, to my great sorrow, I per-
ceived the wreck of a ship cast away upon those
hidden rocks I found when I was out with my boit;
and which, by making a kind of an eddy, were the
occasion of my preservation.
Thus, what is one man's safety is another's ru-
in; for undoubtedly this ship had been driven oh
them in the night, the wind blowing strong at E.
N. E. lijd they perceived the island, as I now..
,•« • guessed
guessed they; had not, ^.certainly, instead of having
fired theij? guns for help, they would rather have'
ventured in their bqat, and saved themselves that
way. I then thought, that perhaps they had done
so, upon seeing my fire, and were castaway in the
attempt; for #I-perceived no boat in the ship. But
then again I imagined, that perhaps they had ano-
ther vessel in company, which, upon signal, saved
their lives, and took the boat up; or that the boat
might be driven into the main ocean* where these'
popr creatures might he In the most miserable con-
dition. But as all these conjectures were very
Uncertain, I could do no more than commiserate
t^eir distress* and thank God for delivering me, la
particular, when so nlany periihed in the raging
ocean. ,
WhenI considered seriottfly.every thing concern*
iug this wreck, and could perceive no^room to
suppose any of them saved, I .cannot explain by a-
ny possible force of words, what longings my foul
felt upon this sight, often breaking out in this,
manner: O that there had been but two or three,
nay even one person saved, that we'might have
lived together, conversed with, &nd comforted one
another! And so much were my desires moved,
thatwhen I repeated these words j " Oh! that there
had been but one!" my hands would so clinch to«
gether, and my fingers press the palms of my hands
so close, that, had any soft thing been between,
it*would have crushed it involuntarily, while my*
* teeth would^strike together, and set against each/
other so strong, that it required some time for me-
to part them. .'
,: 'Till the last year of my being on this island, I
never knew whether or^not any had been saved
out of this ship, I had the affliction some time
after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on
Jhore, at the end o£the island which was next the .
I sliip"
fliipwreck: there was nothing on him but a sea*
man's waistcoat, a pair of operi-kneed linen draw-
ers, and a blue linen shirt; but no particular mark
to guess what nation he was of. In his pocket
were two pieces of eight, and a tobacco pipe, the
last of which I prefer red much more than I did the
first. Ajld now the calmness of the sea tempted
me to venture out in my, boat to this wreck, not
* only to get something necessary out of the-fhip,
but perhaps some living creature might be qn
board, whose life I might preserve. This had such
an hifluence upon my mind, that immediately I
wenthdme^ and prepared every thing necessary fof
the voyage, carrying on boardmy boatprovifions of
all forts, with a good quantity of rum, fresh ya-
ter, and a compass: so putting of, I paddled the
canoe along the shores till I cime at last to the
north east part of the island, from whence I was
to launch into the ocean; but here the currents
ran so violently, and appeared so terrible, that
niy heart began to fail me; foreseeing, that-if I was
driven into any of these currents, I might be, car-
ried not only out of the reach or sight of the ffland
-but even inevitably* lost in the boiling surges of the
ocean.
So oppressed was I at these troubles, that I gave
over my enterprise, Jailing to a little creek on the
shore, where stepping out, 1 sat me down on a ri
sing hill, very pensive and thoughtful. 1 then per-
ceived that the tide was turned, and the flood came
on> which made it impracticable for me to go out
for so many hours. To be more certain how the
sets of the tides or "currents lay when the flood
came in, I ascended a higher piece of ground, which
overlooked the sea both ways; and here I fo^nd,
that as the current of the ebb set out close by the
south-point of the islands so the current of the
''..-. -flood
flood set in close by (bore of the north fide; and
all that I had to do, was to keep to the north of
thejfland in my return.
That night 1 reposed myself in my canoe, cover-
ed with my watch-coat instead of a blanket, the
heavens being my tester. I set out with the first
of the tide full north, till I felt the benefit of the
current, which carried me at a great rate ^eastward,
yet not with such impetuosity as before*, as* to take
from me all government, of my canoe; so that in
two hours time I came up to the wreck, which
appeared to me a most melancholy sight. It seem-
ed to be^i Spanish vessel by its„bxiildiug, stuck fast
"between two rocks; her stern and quarter beaten
to pieces by the sea; her mainmast and foremast
were brought off by the board; that is; broken
short off. As 1 approached nearer I perceived 4
- dog on board, who seeing me coming, yelped and
pried; and no sooner did I call him, but the poor
creature jumped into,the sea, out of which 1 took
him up, almost famished with hunger and thirst;
so that when I gave him a cake of bread, no raven-
ous wolf could devour it more greedily: arid he:
0rank^o that acgi-xrc-uf-frefli water, tliat fte would"
have burst himself, had I suffered, bim.
The first sight I wet with in the ship, were two
men drowned in the cook-room or forecastle, inclo-
sed in one another's arms: hence I very probably
supposed* that when the vessel struck in the storm,
so high and incessantly did the waters break in and
over her* that the men net being able to bear it/
were strangled by the constant rushing in of the
waves. There were several casks of liquor, whether
wine or brandy I could not be positive, which lay an
'the lower hold, as were plainly perceptible by "the
ebbing out of the water, yet were tpb large forme
to pretend to middle with: likewise I perceived se-
veral chests, which I supposed to belong to the
I % seamen*
seamen^ twc* of which I got into my boat, without
examining what was in them. Had the stern of
the ship been fixed, and the fore part broken off,
I should have made a very prosperous voyage\
since, by what I after found in these two chests, I
could not otherwise conclude, but that the ship mi|st
have abundance of wealth on board; nay, if I must
guess by the course she, steered, she must have
been bound from the Buenos Ayres, or the Rip
de la Plata, in the southern past of America, be-
yond the Brazils to the Havannah, in the gulph
of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. What be-
came of the rest of her sailors, I could not certainly
tell; and all her riches signified nothing at that
time to any body.
k Searching farther, I found a calk, containing a~
bout twenty gallons, full of liquor, which, with
some labour, I got into my boat; in a cabin were
several muskets, which Ilet remain there; but took
away with me a great powder-horn* with about
four pourids of powder in it. I took* also a fire-
fhbvel and tongs, two brass kettles, a copper pot
tQ isdfcs chocolate, and a grid-iron; all which were
Extremely necessary to me, especially the fire-sho-
vel and tongs. Andk so with this cargo, accom-
panied With my dog, I came away, the tide serving,
for that purpose; and the same evening, about an
hour withjn night, I attained the island, after the
greatest toil and fatigue imaginable.
*' That night I reposed my wearied limbfc in the
boat, resolving the next morning to harbour what
I had gotten in my new-found subterraneous grot-
to; and not carrying my cargo home to my,anci-
ent castle. Having refreshed myself, and got all
my effects on shore, I next proceeded to examine
the particulars; and*so tapping the cask, I found
the liquor to be a kind of a rum, but not like what
we had at the Brasils, nor indeed ,near so good.
^ "At
At the opening of the chest, several things appeared
very useful to me; for instance, I found in one æ
.' very fine case of bottles, containing the finest and
best forts of cordial waters; each bottle hekka-
bout three pints, curiously tipt with silver. £
found also two pots full of the choicest sweatme~atsr
and two more which the water had utterly {poiled-
Thef e were likewise several good ihirtsy exceed-
ing welcome to me, and about one dozen and a
half of white linen handkerchiefs and* coloured
neckcloths, the former of which were absolutely
necessary for wiping my face in a hot day;, and in-
the till, I found three bags of pieces of eight, about'
eleven hundred in all, in one of which, decently
wrapt, up in a piece of paper, were six doubloons,
of gold, and some . small bars and . wedges of the
fame metal, which 1 believe might weigh near a
pound. In the other chest, whichl guessed to be-
long to the gunnerVmate, by the mean circum-
stances that attended itr I only found some clothes-~
of very little value, except about two pounds of
fine glazed powder,, in three flasks,, kept, as I be-
lieve, for charging, their fowling-pieces on any oc-
casion;, so that, on the whole, I had no great ad-
vantage, by this voyage, t The^mortey was indeed;
as mere dirt tg- me,; useless and unprofitable, alL
which I would have freely parted with for two or
three-pair of English (hoes and stockings, things,
that for many years I had not worn, except late:
ly^ those which I had taken^off the feet of those un-
fortunate men I had found drowned in the wrecks
yet not so good as English shoes, either for ease ot?
service. I also found in the seamen's chest about fif-
ty pieces of eight in rials, but no gold; so conclu-
ded that what 1 took from the first belonged to an
officer, the latter appearing to have a much infe-
rior person for it's owner* However, as despica-
ble, as the money seemed, I likewise lugged it to,
, . I. 3 m^
my cave, laying it up securely, as Tdid the rest of
my cargo; and after I haddoneall this I returned-
back to my boaj, rowing or paddling her along
till Icame to my old harbour, where I carefully
laid her up, arid so made the best of my way to
ftiy castle. When I arrived there, everything
seemed safe and quiet: so that now my only' busi-
ness was to repose myself after my wonted manner,
and take care of my domestic affairs. But tho* I
might have lived very eafy, as wanting for nothing
* absolutely needful, yet still I was more vigilant
ihan usual upon account of the savages,-never gp-
Jng niuch abroad; or, if I did, it was to the east
part of thfe island,- where I was well assured that
the savages never came, and whete 1 might not be
troubled to carry that heavy load of weapons for
my defence, as 1 was obliged to do if I went the
other way.
Two years did I liv£ in this anxious N condition
in all which, time, contrary to my former refold
tioris, my head was filled with nothing but projects
and deiighs, how I'might escape from'this island;
and so much were my wandering thoughts bent on
a rambling disposition, that had I had "the same
boat that I went from Sallee in, I fhotildhave ven-
tured once trio-re to the uncertainty of the raging
ocean. *
I cannot however but consider myself as one of
the unhappy persons, who make themselves wretch^
ed by their dissatisfaction with the stations which
God has placed them in; for, rot to take a review
of my primitive condition and my Father's excel-
lent advice, (the going contrary to which was,, as
I may fay, \ray wiginal Jin), thefollowing mistakes
of the fame nature certainly had been the meani
of my present unhappy station. What business
had I to leave a settled fortune, and well stocked
^plantation, improving and increasing, where, by
thi&
this time, I might have been worth a Jiundred thou-^
sand moidores, to turn supercargo to Guineas to
fetch negroes, when time and patience Would have
so much enlarged my stock at home, as to be able
to employ those whose more immediate business it
was to fetch them home, even to my own door?
But as this is commonly the fate of young heads^
so a serious reflection upon the folly of it oi*dina- _
rily attends the exercise of future years, when
the dear bought experience of time; teacHes us re-
'pentancer Thus was it with* me; but notwith-
standing the thoughts-of my deliverance ran so
strongly in my mind, that it seemed to check all the
dictates of reason and philosohy. And now to usher
in my kind reader with great pleasure to the remain-
ing part of my relation^ I flatter myself it will
not be taken amiss, to give him an account of my
first conceptions of the manner of escaping, and *
upon what foundation I laid my foolish schemes.
Having retired to my castle, after my fate voy-
age to the Ihip, my frigate laid up and secured, a&
usual, and my condition the same as before, except
being richer, though I had as little occasion for
4 riches as the Indians of Peru had for gold, before
the cruel Spaniards came among them: on£ night
in March, being the rainy season, in the four and
twentieth year of my solitude, J lay down to sleep,
very well in health, without distemper, pain, or
uncommon uneasiness, either of tody or mind;
yet notwithstanding, I'could not compose myself
to sleep all the night long. All this tediefus while,
it is impossible to express what innumerable thoughts
came into my head. I traced quite over the whol&
history of my life in miniature, from my utmost
remembrance of things till I came to this island;
and then proceeded to examine every action and
passage that had occurred since I had taken posses-
sion of my kingdom. In my reflections upon the
latter,
latter^ I was comparing the happy posture of my
affairs in the beginning of my ..reign*, to this life of
anxiety, fear, and concern, since I had discovered
the print of a foot in the sand, that while I con-
tinued without apprehension, I was incapable of
feeling the. dread and terror I now suffered. How;
thankful rather ought I to have been for the know-
ledge of my danger, since the greatest happiness one
can~be possessed of is to have sufficient time to pro*--
vide against it ? How stupendous is the goodneis of
1 Providence, which* sets such narrow bounds to the
fight and knowledge of r human nature, that while
men walk in the midst of so many dangers, they
are kept serene and calm, by having the events-of
things hid from their eyes, and knowing nothing,
of those many dangers that surround them, till, <
perhaps they are dissipated and vanish away.
When I came more, particularly to,consider of
the real danger had for so marry^years escaped;,
how X had walked about in the greatest security
and tranquillity, at a time, perhaps, when even
nothing but the brow of the kill, a great tree, or
the common approach of night, had interposed
- between me and the destructive hands of the can-
nibals,, who would devour me with as good an apr- .
pedte, as I would a pigeon or curlieu; surety all
this, I fay, could not but make me sincerely thank-
ful to my great Preserver, whose singular protec-
tion I acknowledged with the greatest humility*
and without which I must inevitably have fallen.-
into the cruel hands of those devourers.
Having thus discussed my thoughts in the clear-
est manner, according, to my weak understanding*
I next proceeded to consider the wretched nature
of these destroying savages, by seeming, though-
with great reverence* to inquire, why God should'
give up any of his creatures to such,inhumanity*
even to brutality itself, to devour its own kind?
But:
But as this was rather matter of abstruse specula*
tion, and as my miserable situation made me think
this of mine the most uncomfortable situation in
the world, I then began rather to inquire what
pan of the world these wretches lived in $ how
far off the coast was from whence they came $ why
they ventured over so far frctn home $ what kind*
of boats conveyed them hi then and .why I could
not order myself and my business so, that I mights
be as able to attain their ^country, as they were
• to come to my kingdom?
- But then, thought I, how shall I manage myself
when I come thither 5 what will become of me if
I fall into the~ hands of the savages? or how ihall
I escape from them, if they make an attempt upon'
me? and supposing I should not sal) into their
powers what will I do for provision, or which way
mail I bend my course: These counter-thaughts
threw me into the greatest horror and confusion
imaginable; but then#I still looked" upon my pre-
sent condition to be the most miserable that possi-
bly could be, and that nothing could be worse, ex>
cept death. For (thought l)f could I but attaint
the shore of the main, I might pex*haps meet with
some relief, or coast it along, as I did with my boy
Xnry, on the African shore, till I came to some
inhabit id country, where I might meet with some
relief, or fall in with someChristian ship that m ghfe
take me in; ana* if I failed, Why thea I could but
meet with death, which would pufc an end: to all
my njiseries. These thoughts I must confess, were
the fruit; of a distempered mind; an impatient tem-
per, made desperate, as it were, by long contihif*
ance of the troubles and the disappointments I, had
met with in the wreck, where I hoped to have
found some living person to speak to, by whom I
might have known what place I was, arid of the.
probable means of my deliverance. Thus, while
my
my thoughts were agitated, my resignation to the
will of heaven was intirely suspended !; so that I
had no power to fix my mind to any thing, but to
the project of a .voyage to the main land* And
ipdeed so much was I inflamed upon this account,
that it set my blood into a ferment, and my pulse
beat higfy as though I had been in a fever, till
nature oeing, as it were, fatigued and exhausted
with the very thoughts of it, made me submit
myself to a silent repose.
In such a situation it is very^ strange, that I did *
iidt dream of what I was so intent upon; but, in-
stead of jt,- my mind roved on a quite different
thing,? altogether foreignr I dreamed, that as I
was issuing from my castle; one jmorning, as cu-
stomary, I perceived upon the store, two canoes*
and eleven HTavagei, coming to land, who had
brought with them another Indian, whom they de-
signed to make a sacrifice of, in order to devour j
but just as they were going to give the fatal blow,
inethought the, poor designed victim jumped away,
and ran directly into my little thick grove before .
my fortification, to abscond from his enemies j
when perceiving that the others did not follow Inrii
that, way, I appeared to him; that he humbly <
tneeled down before me, seeming to pray for my ,
assistance; upon which I shewed him my dadder,
made him ascend, carried him to my cave, and he
became my servant; and when I had gotten this »
man,; Z said to myself* Now surely I may have
some hopes to attain the main-land 5 for this fel-
low will serve me as a pilot, tell mewhat to do,
and where I must go for provision^; what .places
to shun, whast to venture to, and what to escape.
But when I awaked, and found all these inexpres-
sible impressions of joy entirely vanished, I fell in-
to the,greatest dejection of spirit imaginable.
• Yet this dream brought me to reflect, that one
sure
sure way of escaping wa& to get a savage; that
after I had ventured my life to deliver him from
the bloody jaws of his devburers, the natural fense
he might have os such a preservation, might in-
spire him with a lasting gratitude and most sincere
affection. But then this objection reasonably in-
terposed i How can I effect this (thought I) with-
out I attack a whole caravan of them, and kill
them all? Why should I proceed on such a despe-
rate attempt, which my scruples before had sug-
gested to be unlawful; and indeed my heart trem-
bled at the thoughts of so much blood, though it-
were a means to procure "my deliverance. 'Tis
true, I might reasonably enough suppose these men
to be real enemies to my life,~men who would de-
vour me, was it in their power, so that it was self-
preservation in the highest degree to free myself
by attacking them in my own defence, as lawfu-ly'
as if they were actually aflaulting me: though all
these things, I fay, seemed to me to be of the
greatest weight, yet, as I just said before, the
dreadful thoughts of shedding'human blood, struck
such a terror to my soul, that it was a long time
before I could reconcile myself to it.
- But how far will the ardency of desire prompt
^jus on? For, notwithstanding the many disputes
and perplexities! had vvith myself, I at length re-
solved, right, or wrong, to get; one of these sava-;
'ges into my hands, cost what it would, or even
though I should lose my life in the att.empt. In-
spired with this firm resolution, I set all my wits
,at work, to, find out what methods I should take
to answer my design; this indeed was so difficult u
task, that 1 could not pitch upon any probable
means to execute it: I therefore resolved conti-
nually -to be in a vigHant posture, to perceive
when the savages came on more, and to leave the
rest
Test ter the-event; let theropportunities offer as they
would. ;" 
Such were my fixed resolutions; and accord-
ingly I set myself upon the scout, as often as I
could, till such time as I was heartily tired * of it*
I waited for above a year and a half, the greatest
part of which time I went out to the west and
south-west corner of the island, almosbevery day^
to look for canods ; but none appeared. This was
•a very great' discouragement; yet^ though I was
very much concerned, the edge of my desire* was
as keen as ever, and the longer it seemed to be
delayed, the more eager was I for it: in a word I
never before was so careful to shun the loathing
sight of these savages, as 1 was now eager to be
with them: and I thought myself sufficiently able
to manage onfe, two, or three savages, if I had
them, so as to make them my entire slaves, to do
whatsoever I should direct them, and prevent their
being able &t ^ny time to do me a mischief. Many
times did I use to please myself with thesp thoughts,
with long and ardent expectations; but'nothing
presenting, all my deep projected schemes and
numerous fancies, vanished away, as tho% while
I retained such thoughts, the decree of Provi-
dence was such, that no savages were to come
near me.
About a year and a half after, when I was seri-
ously musing of sundry Other ways how I should
attain my etid, one morning early I was very much
surprised by seeing no less than five canoes all oh.
shore together ©tl my side the island, and the savages
that belonged to them all landed, andout of my sights,
Su ch a number of them disconcerted all my measiurfes$
for seeing so many boats, each of Which could .con-
tain fix, and sometimes more, I could not tell what
to^thinkofitjor how to order my measures, to ar?
tack twenty or thirty men single handed: upon
; which,

Havingiwaited for some time, my impatient* ten**
.per would let me be^ar \% #o longer; J set my:gnns
at the foot of my .ladder* and, as usual,, ascended
*ip to the top of the lull at Jtwo stages^ standing
however in such a* mafririer that my ,head did not
appear above the hi$, so that they could not easi-
ly perceive me: and here, by the assistance of my
perspective glase, I observed no less than thirty in
dumber around,a sfire, feasting upon; what rmeat
they hfid dressed: how they cooked it, or what it
was, I could not then .perfectly tell^ but they were
•all dancing and. capering about the flames, using
-many ^rightful and bar bar out? gestures.
But while, with a curious eye, I was beholding
these wretches, my spirits funk within me, when
I perceived them drag two ^miserable creatures,
from the boats, to act afresh the dreadful tragedy^
•as I supposed they had done before* It Was not
iong,hefpre one of them fell upon the ground,
knocked down, as 1 suppose, with a club or wood-
men sword, for that was their manner; while two
yor three others went immediately to work," cutting
him bpen fprtheir cookery,, and then fell to de*-
!vour him as they had done the former; while,the
last unhappy captive was left by himself till such
Itirae as they were ready for hira.^ The poor crea-
ture looked round him* with a wishful eye, trem-
bling at the thoughts of dea;th$ yet feeing himselsa
little at liberty, nature that, very moment, as it
•wete, smspired him with hopes of life; he started
,away fronvthem, and ran wit^ia£redihleswiftnefe
".along; the sands,,directly to that <par£ ef the coast
wherte my ^aciemt and yener^bbeastk stood*  .
You may well imagine I was dreadfully affrighted
upon this occasion, when, as I thovight, they pur-
sued him in a whole body* all running towards my
paja/ce. And now, indeeo,^\expEcted that part of
my dream was going to be fulfilled, and that he
would certainly fly to my grove for protection,
but for the rest of my dream, I could depend no-
thing on it, that the savages would pursue^ him
thither and find him there. However, my spirits
beginning to recover, I still kept upon my guard;
and I now plainly perceived there were but three
men out of the number that pursued him. I was
infinitely pleased with what swiftness the poor
creature ran from his pursuers, gaining so much
ground of them, that 1 plainly perceived, could he
thus hold it for half an hour, there was not. the
least, doubt but he would save his life Jxom the
potyer of his enemies.
Between them and my castle there was a creek,
the very fame which 1 failed into with all my ef-
fects from the wreck of the ship, on, the steep
banks of wliich livery much feared the poor victihi
would be taken, if he could not swim for his escape:
but soon was I out of pain for him, when I per-
ceived he made nothing of it, though at full tide;
but with an intrepid courage, spurred on by the
sense of danger, he plunged into the flood, swim-
injng over in about thirty strokes, and then land-
ing, ran with the same incredible strength and
swiftness as before. When the tjiree pursuers
came to the creek, one of them, who! perceived
could liot swim (happily for his part,) returned
back to his company; while the others, with as
equal courage, but much less swiftness, attained
the other side, as though^ they^werejpesolyednever
Æogiye over, their pursuit. And now, :br^never,
| thought was the time for me to procure me a
servant, companion, or assistant j and that 1 was
decreed
 
decreed by ^ Providences be-the instrument that
ctioiiid'fafe this poor creature's life. I immedi-
ately 'descended my two ladders with tbe^ greatest
fcpeiftticm; 1 took up my two guns, which 1 soici
Veforfrwere'at the bottom- of them; and getting
tip again with the fame haste towards the hill, 1
made hearer the sea. In a wordy taking a short
cut down the bill* I interposed between the pur*
filers aod pursued, hallooing aloud to the latter,
who venturing to look back, was no doubt at first
Its much terrified at me as I at them. 1 beckoned
to him wish my hand to return back, in the mean
time advancing towards the pursuers, and rustling
on the foremost, I knocked him- down with the
frnrk of mv piece, nnd laid Mat fiat an the ground*
1 was -scry unwilling to fire, lest the rest slioukt
hear, thongh at that di'iance I questioned whether
fhev could or no; and being out of light of the
smokf., they could not easily have known \^hat ta
make oi it." The other savage seeing his fellow
fall, flopped a fe if he had been amazed; when, ad-
vancing towards him, 1 could perceive him take
1ns bow from his back, ?<m\ fixing an arrow to itf
was preparing to ihoot at me, and without dispute
might have lodged the arrow in my breast; but,
in this absolutely neecfury cafe of self-preserva-
tion, I immediately fired at him, and ihot him dead,
just as his hand was going to draw the fatal string.
All this while the savage who had fled before stood
still, and had the satirda-ilion to see his enemies
killed, as he thought, who designed to take away
hh life: so arlrighced was he with the fire and
noise ot" my piece, that he stood as it were like
Lot's wile, fixed and immoveable, without either
$?nrv or motion. This* obliged me to halloo to
him again, making the; plainest signs I could to him
v.* draw nearer. I pei eeived he understood these

several times did lie advance, and as often" stop in
this manwer, till, coming'more to my view, I per-
ceived him trembling, as if he was to> undergo-the
fame fate. Upon which 1 looked upon him with
a. smiling conntenance, and still beckoning to him;
at length he came close to me, and" kneeled down,
killed the ground, laid his head upon it, and taking
me:- by my. foot, set the'fame upon his head: and"
this,, as i' understood afterwards, was a token- of
swearing to be my slave for ever. _ I took him up,.
and' making much of him, encouraged bite in the
best- manner I could. But my work was not yet
finished; for 1 perceived the savage whom I knock*'
ed down, was not killed, but., shinned with the'
Blow,, and began to come to himself. Upon which
1 pointed to my new servant, and shewing "him that*
bis "enemy was not yet expired, bespoke some'
"nwds to me,' but which I could not understand j
yet being the 'first sound of a man's voice 1 had
heard for above twenty-live years, they were very
pleasing to me. But there was no time foe refiee-
tion 'now, the wounded savage recovering'himself
lo far "as to sir upon t^e grenmd, tthkh - m<Kle my

token of triumph, delivered me my sword again*
with abundance of surprising gestures, laying it'
along, with the blooding and ghastly head of the-
Indian at my'feet.'
The greatest astonishment that my new servant
conceived, was the manner of killing, the savages*
at such a distance, without a bow and arrow: and^
such was his longings desire to know it, that he first"
pointed to the dead carcase, and then made signs
to me to grant him leave to go to, him.- Upon*
which* I bid him go, and as-well as I could, made;
him sensible I granted his request. But when he
came there, how-wonderfully was he struck with
amazement! First he turned him on one side, then
on another, wondering he Gould perceive no quan-
tity of blood, he bleeding inwardly: and after
sufficiently admiring the wound the Bullet had
made in his breast, he took up his bow and arrows,
and came back again j upon which/1 turned*to go
away, making many signs to him to follow, lest,
the rest mining their companions, might come in
pursuit of him. % And this-1 found he understood
very well, by his making me to understand that
his design v/as to bury them, that they might not
be seen if it happened; dnd which by signs agaitv
I made him sensible I very much approved of* In>
mediately he fell to warky and never was grave*
digger more dexterous in the world than he was 5,
for in an instant, as I might fay he scraped a large
hole in the sands with his liandsr sufficient to bury
the first in;- there he dragged himr and without,
any ceremony he covered him-over;, in like man-
ner he served the others so that I am sure no un-
dertaker could be more expert in his business;,for
all this was done m less than a quarter of an hour.
J then called him away, and instead of carrying
6im directly to my castle at firstr I conveyed him
to my caver on the further par£ of the island:,
K 3 aria*
and so niy dream #as not fulfilled* hi that partlctl*
lar, that my grove should prpve an asylum or fane*
iuary to him.
Weary and fahrt^ hungry and thirsty, undoubt-
edly nrast tills* poor creature be, supported chiefly
by that vivacity of spirit, and uncommon trans*
forts of joy that his deliverance occasioned. Here>
I gave him bread, and a bmidi of raisins to eat,
and water to drink, on whick he fed very chear^
fully, to his1 e&ceedirig refreshment* 1'thda made
him a convenient bed, with a parcel of rice straw,,
and a blanket upon*it, (a bed which 1 used myself
sometimes,) and then pointing to it, made fign^
fbr him to lye dcAvri to sleep, upon which the poor
creature went to take a Welcome repose.
Indeed he wafs Pt very comely handsome young
bellow, extremely well made,* with straight long
limbs, not too large, tali and well shaped, andr
as near as I- could reckon, about twenty-six years
of age. His countenance had nothing in it fierce
or surly, but rather a sort of majesty in his-face?
and ^ei, especially when he sins led, he had all the
, sweetness and softness 6f an European Hh hair
was not curled like wool, as mariy of the blacks*
aref but ldng.and black, with the most bedutiful^
yet careless, treflesi spreading over his shoulders.
He had a very high and large foreheads \vith a,
great vivacity and sparkling sharpness In His eyes.
His ifein was-notso tawny as the Virginians,: Bra-
silians, or other Americans, but rrtther-of a bright
Am olive colour, that had something agreeable itifc
it,, though riot very easy to giVe T:description of*
Bi& face wasTdirad a;nd prutrip, with a small nose,:
very different from the flatness of the negroes, a^
pretty small mouth, thin jfpsy fine teeth; very welE
se>, and white ai the driven snow. In a <vord/ -
such handsome features, and e>tac"r/ symmetry in
every part, made i&e consider, f has I had sav^d the1;
life
at %Oi}ltt$CsS$ CHU'S'tfB.' its
Bf£ of an Indian prince, tto lese graceful and ac-
complishedthan^ the great Grbonoko, whose me-
morable behaviour and- unhappy contingencies of
life have charmed the world, both to admiration*
of his person/ and eompaffidn to his sufferings.
But let him be either prince or peasant, all my
Bappiness centered in this, that I had now got a*
gdbd servant or companion* to whom, a*s he de-
served,, I Was resolved to prove a kind master and?
lasting friend. He had not, I think, slept above
an hour, when he awakened again, and while I
was milking my goats hard by, out he runs from,
the cave towards me in my inclosure,- and layings
himself down on the ground in the lowest prostra-*
tidn, made all the antic gestures imaginable, to
express his thankfulness to me for being his deln
terer. I Confess, though the manner of his belia*
vibur seemed to be ludicrous enough to occasion*
laughter, yet I was very much moved at hi* affec-
tion, so that my heart melted within me, fearing
Be might die a Way in excess1 of joy$ like reprieved5
malefactors; especially as I Was incapable either
to let him blood, or administer physic. It were
tobewiihed, that Christians would take exampse
fey this Heather*, to hav'6 a lasting remembrance
of the benefits and deliverances they have recei-
ved, by the kind mediation aud powerful interpo-
sition of their beiiefactdf^ and deliverers: and it
\tould likewise be happy sdi* mankind, were there1
no occasion to blame marly, who, instead of thank-
fully acknowledging favours ard benefits, rathet* *
abuse and conreriin those Who have-been the in-
struments to safe them from destruction.
But, leaving these just reflections^ I rfctufii to
the. object that occallbnett theiii; for my man, tc* 
doiielude the last cefembny of obedietide, laid
dbwti his head agairi on the grbuftd, close to niy
feot^ arid set my other foot upon his head) as b£ *
had
had done*before, making all the signs of subjec-
tion, servitude, and submission imaginable, to let,
me understand he would serve me as long as his
life endured* As I understood him in many things,
I made him sensible I was very well pleased with}
him; and in a little time! began to speak to him,
and learn him how to talk to me again. In the:
first place, I made him understand his name was*
to be Friday, because it was upon that day I saveefc
bis life: then I taught him to fay Master, which
I made him sensible was to be my name. I like-
wise taught him to say Yes and No, and to know-
what they meant* I gave him some milk in an
earthen pot, making him view me while I drank:
it before him, and soaked^ my bread in it f I gave,
him a cake of bread, and caused him soak it like-*
wise, to which he readily consented, making signs-
of the greatest satisfaction imaginable.
AU that night did I keep him- there; but nor
sooner did the morning light appear, when I order-
ed him to- arise, and come along with me, with-
certain tokens that I would give him some clothes,
like mine, at which he seemed very glad, beings
stark naked, without the least covering whatever.
As we passed by the place where the two men had
been interred, my man pointed directly to their-
graves, shewing me the marks that he had made-
to find them again, giving me to under stand, bp
signs, that he would dig them up, and devours
them* At this I appeared extremely displeased, ex^
, pressed my: utmost abhorrence,, as if 1 would vomit-
- at. the apprehensions of it, beckoning with my-
hand to cbme away, which he did with the greatest
reverence and submissions After this. I conducted-
him to the top of the hill, to view if the rest of
the savages were yet remaining thereof, bufc when,
I looked through my perspective glass, I could see.
no appearance of them,, nor of their canoes; so.

jdeceasedcompanions whom I had slain; which, if
they had, they wonidijurely have searched fot% ot?
left one boat behind for them to*foilo^7 after they
returned from their piwsurt. -
Curiosity, and a desire of satisfaction, anima*
tiiig me with courage to fee this- scene of barbari-
ty, I took my* man Friday with me, putting an
sward into his* hand^ -with the bow and arrows at* 1
hrs-bark, which 1 perceived he* could use very dex«^
terousty, causing rhim to. carry ^one gun for me,
and I two for myself; aud thug equipped against'
all attacks, away we marched directly to the place,
of their bloody entertainment. But when I came:*
there, I was struck with the utmost horror atsoi
dreadful a* spectacle, whilst Friday was ncr w&y*
concerned about it, being no doubt in his turn one
of these devourers. Here lay several humanbones,
there several pieces of mangled fteffo, half eaten,*
mangled and scorched, whilst4 streams -of- bldod rar*
promiscf*oufty as waters fronr a fonifitain- As I-
, wa$ muling on this dreadful iight,*TFriday took all?

rae: understand/that they had brought ^ver^fouf-
prisoners to feast upon, three of whom .they h&df
esttenup, arid that he* was the? fourth pointing ta
himself? rhat there having been* a, bloody battle*
between 4hem and his great king, hx the just dew
fence of whom he was1 taken prisoner^ with many
others i'all 4f these were carried ©if to different1
places, to be devoured by their conquerors j/ani
that it w** his-misfortune to be brought hither by
these wretches *for the fame purpose, - >
; -After I was made sensible of these things, I cau-
sed Friday i& gather tihesehorrid remains,, and lay
tjietrr together upon a he^p; *whieh I ordered to bb
Ut on fire, and burnt th^m to^ ashes t-roy man,-
J^wever, 4UU retained the nature as a cannibals
!v ,f having
u8 X*IFE .a v i> AD VINTURfiS
having a hankcring stomach asCer some of the flesh;
but such an extreme abhorrence did I express* at
the least appearance of.it, that hedurst not but
conceal it; for I made him very sensible*- that if
he offered any -such thing, I would certainly flioot
him. - - .
This being done, I carried my man with me to
my castle, and gave him a pair of linen drawers^
which I had- taken* but of the poor gunner's chest
before mentioned^ and which, with a little alter-
ation, fitted him very well; in* the next place, t
made him a jerking of goat-skin, such as my skill
was able to manage, and indeed I thought myself
then a tolerable good tailor. I gave him also a?
cap, which I made of a hare?s ikin, very corive-*
nient and fashionable. Thus being eloathed toler
rable well, my man was no less proud of his habits
than I was in seeing him in it. Indeed he went
very aukwardly at first, the drawers being toa
heavy on his thighs, not used to bear any weight,
and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his fhoul-
cjers, and the inside of his arms; but by a little*
easing where he complained they hurt him, and by
using himself to them, at length he took to then*,
lfery well.
My next concern was,, where I should lodge
him: and that I might do well by-hintya^d yet be
perfectly easy myself, I erected a tent for him in
the vacant place between my two,fortifications,*m
the{ inside of the last, and the outside of the first:
and as there was an entrance or door intp my cave,<
I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to
open on the inside; I barred it up in the nights
time, taking in my ladders too; so that, was my
man to prove treacherous, there could be ho w&y
to come at me in tjie inside of my innermqst wall*
without making so much noise in gettingover, that
it, must needs waken me j for my first >vajy| .had now
- a com?-
~ ot R O B VNS ON CRUS O^. it?
a complete roof over it of long poles, spreading
over my tent, and leaning up to the side of thp
inountain; which was again laid cross with smaller
sticks instead of laths, and thatched over a great
thickness with rice straw, which was as strong as
reeds: and at the hole of the place, left on pur-
pose to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a
kind of a trap-door, which, if it had .been attempt-
ed on the outside, would not have opened at all,
but have fallen down, and made a great noise;
and as to my_ weapons, every night I took them
all to my bed-side.
But there was-no occasion for this precaution;
for surely never master had a more sincere, faith-
ful, and loving servant than Eriday proved to me.
Without passion, sulknness, or design, perfectly
obliging and engaging, his affections were as much
tied to me, as those of a child to his parents: and
1 might venture to fay, be would have sacrificed
his life for the saving mine, upon any occasion
whatsoever. And indeed the many testimonies he.
gave me of this, sufficiently convinced me that I
had nb occasion to use these precautions* And
here I could not but reflect, with great wonder,
that however it has pleased the Almighty in hfe
providence, and in the government of the creation,
to take from so great a part of the'world of his
creatures, the noblest uses to whkh their facul-
ties, and the powers of their fouls are adapted,
yet that he has bestowed upon them the fame reav
son, affections, sentiments of kindness, and oblk
gation, passions of resentment, sincerity, fidelity,
and all the capacities of doing and receiving good
that he has given us; arid that when he is graci-
ously pleased to offer them occasions of exerting
these; they are as ready, nay, more ready, to ap-
Ely them to the proper uses for which they werje
estowedr/tban we ofteit are. These thoughts
would
,itt> I?IFE-AKb ABVEVNTURES
would make me radahcholy, especially when icon*,
•iidered how mean a aise we make of all these,-even
though we have these powers enlightened by the
Holy Spirit of God, und by the knowledge of his
word, as an addition to our understanding $ and
why it has pleased the heavenly Wisdom to con-
æealithe like saving knowledge from so many mil-
lions oFfouls, wlio could certainly make a much
.better use of it than generally mankind do at this
time. These reflections would sometimes lead mie
so far, as to invade the sovereignty <rf provi-
dence, and, as it were, arraign the justice of
rsuchan arbitrary disposition of (things,* that should
obscure that light from some* and; reveal it to
others, and yet expecl: a like duty from all. JBut
I closed it tip, checking my thoughts with this
iconclusion; firsts That we,were ignorant of that
right and law by which these mould be condemn-
ed; but that as the Almighty was necessarily, and
iby the nature of his essence, infinitely just anil
rholy; so it could. not be otherwise,, but that if
Ithese creatures were all destined to absence from
Oiimseif, it was on account of iinnkig against that
Jight, "which, as the scripture says, was a law to
themselves, and by such rules as their conscien-
ces would acknowledge to be just, though the first
foundation was not discovered to us. And, second-
ly, That still as We were the clay in the hand of
the potter, nowessel could tbus,say to him, Why
•hast thou faifliioned me after this ;mannef?
I had not been above two or three days return-
ed to my castle, but my chief design was, how I
sliauld bring Friday off from his horrid way o£
•feeding; and to take from him that inhuman relish
ll\6 ;by nature had been accustomed to, I thought
-it m*/ duty toilet him.taste other flesh, which might
the vather certipt him to1 the fame abhorrence l.Xp
^ften^pr^M against 4heir accursed way of Hv-
l S . * ". ''ing,
ing. Upon which one morning I took him out
with me, with an intention to kill a kid out of
the flock, and bring it home, and dress it. As I
was going, I perceivecl a she-goat lying down in the
shade, and two young kids sitting by her. Imme-
diately I catched hold of my man Friday, and bid*
ding him stand still and not stir, I presented my piece,
and sliot one of the kids. My poor servant, who had
at a distance perceived me kill his adversary, and
yet did not know by what means, or how it was
done,- stood trembling and surprised, and looked
so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk in-
to the earth, He did not see the kid I aimed at,
or beheld I had killed it, but ripped up his waist-
coat to fee if he was not wounded, thinking my
resolution was to kill him; for coming to me, he
fell on his knees earnestly pronouncing many
things which I did not understand the meaning of;
which at length I perceived was, that I would not
take away his life. ~
Indeed I was much concerned to fee him in that
condition, where nature is upon the severest trial,
when the immediate hand of death is ready to put
for ever a period to this mortallife: and indeed so
much compaffion had I to this creature, that it was
with difficulty I refrained from tears. But how-
ever, as another fort of countenance w7as necessa-
ry, and to convince him that I would do him no,
harm, I took him, smiling, by the hand, then laugh-
ed at him, and pointing to the kid which I had
slain, made signs to him to fetch it, which accor-
dingly he did. No less curious was he in viewing
how the creature was killed, than he had been be*
fore in beholding the Indian; which, while he was
admiring at, I charged my gun again, and present-
ly perceived a great fowl like a hawk, perching u-
ppna tree within shot; and, therefore, to let Friday
uriderstand what I was going to do, I called him to
K' L me
me again* pointing at the fowl, which I found to
be a parrot. I made him understand that I would
shoot and kill that bird; accordingly I sired, and
bid him look, when immediately he saw the1 par-
rot fall down. Again he stood like one amazed,
notwithstanding all I had said to him; and the more
confounded he was, because he did not perceive nie
put any thing into my gun.. Undoubtedly a thing
so, utterly strange, carrying death along with it,
far or near, either, to man or beast, must certain-
ly create the greater astonishment to one who had
never heard of such a thing in his whole life: and
really his amazement continued so long, tjiat had
I allowed it, he would have prostrated himself be-
fore me and my gun, with the greatest worship and*
adoration. As for the gun in particular, he would
not so much as suffer his fingers to touch it for se-
veral days after; but would come and communi-
cate his thoughts to it, and talk to it, as if the
senseless piece had understood and answered him:
all this I could perceive him do, when he thought
my back was turned, the chief intent of which was,
to desire it' not to kill him, as I afterwards came
to understand. -
I never strove to prevent his admiration, nos
hinder him from" those comical gestures he used on
such occasions; but when his astonishment was a
little over, I made tokens to. him to run and fetch
the parrot that I had fhr>t; which he accordingly
did, staying some time longer than usual, by reason
the bird, not being quite dead, had fluttered some
way farther from the place where (lie fell. In the
mean time, as he was looking for her, I took the
advantage of charging my gun again, "that so' I
might be ready for any other mark that offered;
but nothing more occurred at that time. Sol

coulcl. Part of this flesh I stewed and boiled, in a
pot I had for this purpose. And then spreading
my table, I sat down, giving my man some of it
to eat, who was wonderfully pleased, and seemed
to like it very well; but what was most surprising
to him was to fee me eat salt with it: upon which
he made me to understand, the salt was very bad
for me; when putting a little into his mouth he
seemed to nauseate it in such a manner, as to spit
and sputter at it, and then washed his mouth with
fresh water: but to shew him how contrary his
opinion was to mine, I put some meat into my
mouth without salt, and feigned to spit and sput-
ter as much for the want of it, as he had done at
it: yet all this proved of no signification to Fri-
day; and it was a long while before he could en-
dure fait in his meat or broth, and even then but
a very small quantity.
Thust having fed him sufficiently with boiled
meat and broth at that time, the next day I was
resolved to feast him with a roasted piece of the
kid. And. having no spit to fasten it, nor jack to
turn it, I made use of that common artifice which
many of the people of England have, that is, to
set two poles upon each fide of the fire, and one
cross on the top, hanging the meat thereon with
a string, and so turning round continually, roait
it in the same manner as we read bloody tyrants
of old cruelly roasted the holy .martyrs. This
practice caused great admiration in my man Friday,
being quite another way than that to which the
savages were accustomed. But when he came to
taste the sweetness and tenderness of the fleKh, he-
expressed his entire satisfaction above a thousand
different ways. And as I could not but understand
his meaning, you may he sure I was as wonder-
fully pleased, especially when he made it also very
, L 2 plai&i
plain to me, that he would never, while, he lived,
eat man's flesh more.
It is now high time I should set my servant to
work 5 so next day I put him to beat cut some
corn, and lift it in tne same manner as I had
done before. And really the fellow was very
quick and handy in the execution of any thing I
ordered him to go about. I made him understand
It was to make bread for us to eat, and afterwards
let him fee me bake it. In short, he did every
thing as I ordered him in a little time as well as I
could perform it myself.
But now considering I had two mouths to feed
instead of one, it was necessary that I must pro-
vide more ground for my harvest, and plant a lar-
ger quantity of corn than I commonly used to do;
Upon which I marked out a larger piece of land,
fencing it in, in the same manner as I had , done
before; in the execution of which I must give
Friday this good word, that no man could work
more hardy,, or with better^wili than he did: and
when I made him sensible that it was for bread to
serve him as well as me, he then very passionately
made me understand, that he thought I had much
more labour on his account, than I had for myself;
and that no pains or diligence should be wanting
in him, if I would but direct him in those works
wherein he might proceed.
I must certainly own, that this was the most
pleasant year I ever had in the island; for after
some time Friday began to talk pretty well, and
'understand the names of those things which I was
wont to call for, and the places whqre I used to
send him. So that my long silent tongue, which
had been useless so many years, except in an ex-
clamatory manner, either for deliverance, or bles-
sings, now began to be occupied in teaching, and
talking to my man Friday; for indeed I had such
a singular
£ singular satisfaction in the fellow himself, so in*
nocent did his simple and unfeigned honesty appear1
more and more to me every day, that 1 really be-
gan entirely to love him, and for his part, I bei
lieve there was no love lost, and that his nature
had been more charmed with my exceeding kind-
ness, and his affections more placed upon me, than:
any oth^r object whatsoever among his own coun-
trymen. I once had a great mind< to try if he had
any hankering inclination to his own country again I
and by this time having learned him the English so*
well, that.he could give me tolerable answers tc*
any question which I demanded, I asked him, whe*
ther that nation to which he belonged ever con-
quered in battle? This question made Friday to
smile, and to which he answered, Yes, yes, We
always fight the better; as much as to fay, they
always got the better in fight. J£Jpon which we:
proceeded on the following discourse.' You %,
laid I, that you always fight the better; why then,,
Friday, how came you to be taken prisoner?
.Friday. But for alf that, my nation beat much.*
Master. How, sayyod, beat! if your natioru
beat them,, how came you to be taken?
Friday. They more many mans than my nations
in the place where me was, they take one, twor
three, and me: my nation much overbeat them m.
the yonder place where me now was,, there my:
nation mans beat one, two, three,. great tout
Master. Then why did'not your men recover-
you from the^hands of your enemies?
Friday. They run one, two, or three, and me:;

canoo that time.
* Master, >Tis very well, Friday; but what does:
yaur nation do-with the prisoners-they take? Dai

L 3J
they carry them away and eat them as these have
done?
. Friday. Yes, yes, my nation eat mans too, eat
•up all.
Master. To what place do they carry them to
be devoured.
Friday. Go to other nations where they think.
. Master. Do they bring them hither?
: Friday. Yes, come over hither, come over
other place,
,' Master. And have you been with them here
Friday? - • -. ._
„ Friday. Yes, me been here, {pointing to the
north weft of the island, being the side where jhey
wftd to land.)
Thus having got what account T could from my
Hian, I plainly understood, that he had been as
bad as any of the rest of the cannibals, haying
been formerly among the savages who used to come
on shore on the farthest part of the island, upon
the sajne bloody occasion as he was brought hither
for : and sometime after I carried him to that place
where he pointed; and no sooner did he come
there, but he presently knew the ground, signify-
ing te me that he was once there when they ate
up twenty men, two women, and a young child f
but as he could not explain the number in Englijhr
he did it by so many stones in a row, making a
fign to me to count them.
This passage I have the rather mentioned, be-
cause it led to things more important and useful
for me. to know: for after I had this satisfactory
discourse with, him, my next question was, how
far it was from the island to the shore, and whe*
ther the canoes were not often lost in the ocean?
To which he answered, there was no danger; that
no canoes were ever lost; but that after a little
way out to the sca? there was a strong current*
- . * *" and
and a wind always one way in the afternoon. This
I thought at first to be no more than the sets of
the tide, of going out or coming in; But I after-
ward understood it was occasioned by the great
draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko,
in the mouth or gulf of which I imagined my king-
dom lay; and that the land which I perceived to
the W. and N. W. must be the great island Trini-
dad, on the north of the river, A thousand ques-
tions (if that would satisfy me) did I ask Friday
about the nature of the country-, the sea, the
coasts, the inhabitants, and what nations were
nearest them; to which questions the poor fellow
declared all he knew, with the greatest opennesa
and utmost sincerity. When I demanded of h.ni
the particular names of the various nations of his
fort of people^ he could only answer me in gene-
ral, that they were called Carabe. Hence it was
I considered that these must be the CaribbeeS, so
much taken notice of by pur maps, to be on that
part of America, which reaches from the mouth
of the river Oroonoko to Guiania, and so;on to
$t„ Martha. Then Friday proceeded to tellme,
that up a great way beyond the moon, as much as
to fay, beyond the setting of the moon, which must
be W. from their country, there dwelt white-
bearded men such as I, was, pointing to my whis-
kers, and that they kill much maiis. I was not ig-
norant with what barbarity the Spaniards treated
these creatures; so thai: I presently concluded it
must be them, whose cruelties had spread through-
out America, to be remembered even to succeeding
generations.
. Weil, you may be sure, this knowledge, which
the imperfect: information of my man had led me
to, was very comfortable to me, and made me so
curious as to ailc him, how I might depart from
this island, and get among those white men ? "He
told
told me, Yes, yes, I might go in two canoes. In
two canoes, thought I what does my man mean j
Surely he means one for himself, and another for
me; and if not, how must two eanoes hold me
without being joined, or one part of my body
being put in one, and another in the other? And
indeed it was a l'ong while before I understood his
meaning, which was, that it must be a large boat,
as big as two canoes, able to bear with the waves*
and not £6 liable to be overwhelmed" as one musk
be.
1 believe there is no state of life but what may
be happy, if people would but endeavour for their
part to make it so. He is riot the happiest man
that has the most riches, but hi. that is content
with what he hath. Before I had my servant, I
thought myself miserable till I had him; and now
that I enjoyed the hsppy benefits of him* I still
complained, and begged a deliverance from a place
of retirement, ease, and plenty, where Providence
had sufficiently blessed me. In a word, from this
time I entertained some hopes, that one time or
other I might find an opportunity to make my
escape from this island, and that this poor savage,
might be a great furtherance thereto
AU the time since my man became lo intelligent:
as to understand and speak to me, I spared no *
pains nor diligence twinstruct 1iim, according tp4
my poor share of knowledge, in the principles of
religion, and the adoration that he ought to pay
to the True God, One time, as Ir very well re*
member, I asked him who made him? At first the
innocent creature did not understand what I rneantf,
but rather thought I asked him who was his-fa-
ther; upon which I, took another way to make:
himTenstble, by demanding from him an answer
to this question, Friday, said I, who is it that
made the sea, this ground whereon we walk- and.
. alii
all these hills and woods whjch we behold? And
here indeed I did not miss of my intention; for
he told me, it was old Benamuckee (the god whom
I supposed these savages adored) who lived a great
way beyond all. But as for his attributes, poor
Friday was an utter stranger. He could describe
nothing of this great person ; and all that he could
say was, that he was very old, much older than
the sea and land, the moon, or the stars* Friday,
(said I again,) if this great and old person has
made all things in the world, how comes it to p'ass^
that all things, as you in particular, do not adore
and worship him? Upon this* looking very grave,
with a perfect sweet look of innocence, he replied,
Master, all things say 0 to him, by which it may
reasonably be supposed he meant adoration. And
where, said I, do the people of your country go
when they die? He answered, they all go to l$e-
namuckee* What, and those people that are eaten
up, do they go there? Benamuckee, said he, love
\erri dearly; me pray to Benamuckee in de canoe,
and Benamuckee ivou'd love me when dey^eat a me
[all up.
Such discourses as these had I with my man, and
such made me sensible, that the true ©od is wor-
sliipped, though under imperfect similitude; and
that the false adoration which the Heathens give
to their imaginary deity, is as great an argument
of the divine essence, as the most learned Atheist
(falflysb^ called)^ can bring against it: for^ God will
;be glorified in his works, let the denomination be
.what it will; and I cannot be of that opinion
which some conceive, that God should decree men
to be damned for want of a right notion of faith,
in a place where the wisdom of the Almighty has
not permitted it to be preached; and therefore
.cannot but conclude, that since obedience is the
best sacrilice, these poor creatures^ acting by that
/ Kg*1*
light and knowledge which they are possessed with,
may nndoubtedly obtain a happy salvation, tho*
not that enjoyment wjth Christ, asiiis faints, con-
fessors, and martyrs must enjoy.
But laying these determinations aside, more fit
- for divines than me to discuss, I began to instruct;
my servant in the saving knowledge of*the true
Deity, in which the directions of God's Holy Spi-
rit assisted me. I lifted up my hands to heaven,
and pointing thereto, told him, that the great
Maker of heaven and earth lived there: that as
his infinite power fashioned this world put of a
confused chaos, and made it in that beautiful frame
which we behold, so he governs and preserves it
by his unbounded knowledge, sovereign greajnessy
and peculiar providence; that he was omnipotent,
could do every thing for us, give every 'thing to
us, and take every thing away from us: that he
was a rewarder and punislier of good and evil ac-
tions: that there was nothing but what he*knew,
no thoughts so secret but what he could bring to
light; and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes,
and described to him the manner of the creation
of the world, the situation of paradise, the trans-
gression of our first parents, the wickedness of
God's peculiar people, and the universal sins and
abominations of the whole earth. When^these
things were implanted in his mind, I told him,
that as God's justice was equal to his mercy, he
resolved to destroy this world, till his Son Jesus
Christ interposed in our behalf; and, to procure
our redemption, obtained leave of his heavenly
Father to come down from heaven into the world,
where he taok human nature upon liim, instructed
us in our way to eternal life, and died as a sacri-
fice for our sins; that he was now ascended into
heaven, mediating for our pardon, delivering our
petitions, and obtaining all those good benefits
which
which we ask in his name, by humble and hearty
prayers, all which were heard ar the throne of
heaven. As * very frequently I used to inculcate
things intd his mind, Friday one day told me, that
if our great God could hear us beyond the fun, he
must surely be a greater God than their Benamuc-
kee9 who lived but a little way off, and yet could
not hear them till they ascended the great moun-
tains where he, dwelt, to speak to him. What,
said I, Friday, did you go thither to speak to him
too? He answered, No, they never went that
were young men, none but old men called their
Oowakakee, meaning the Indian priests, who went
to fay 0, (so he called faying their prayers,) and
they returned back, and told them what Benani.c-
kee said. From hence! could"not .but observe how
happy we Christians are, who hath God's immedi-
ate revelation for ottr certain gui^e; and that our
faith is neither misled, nor our reason imposed
upon, by any set of men such as these Indian im-
postors.
But, to clear up this palpable cheat to my man
Friday, I told him, that the pretence of their an-
cient men going up to the mountain to fay O to
their god Benamuckee was an imposture, and that
their bringing back an answer was ail a sham, if
not worse; for that if there was any such thing
spoken to them, surely it must proceed from an
infernal spirit. And here I thought it necessary
to enter into a long discourse with *him, which I
did after this manner:
Friday, (said I,) you must know that before this
world was made, there was an almighty power ex-
isting, by whose power all things were made, and
whose majesty shall have no end. To be glorified
and adored by beings of a heavenly nature,.he cre-
ated angels and arch-angels, that is, glorious spi-
rits resembling himself, to encompass his throne,
eternally
*
eternally finging forth his praise in the most hea-
venly sounds and divine harmony. . And, among
this heavenly choir, Lucifer bore a great sway, as
being then one of the peculiar favourites of these
celestial abodes; but he, contrary to that duty he
owed his heavenly sovereign, with unbounded in-
gratitude to his divine Creator, not only envied
him that adoration which was his due, but thought
to usurp that throne which he had neither power
to keep, nor title to pretend to, Jfle raised a dis-
sension and civil war in heaven, and had a num-
ber of angels to take his part.^ Unbounded folly!
stupendous pride! thus to hope for victory, and
aspire above his powerful Creator! the Deity, not,
fearful of such an enemy, yet justly provoked at
this rebellion, commissions his arch-angel Michael
to lead forth the heavenly host, and give him bat-
tle; the advantage of which was quickly percei-
ved, by Satan's being overthrown, and the prince
of the air (for so the devil was called) with all his
fallen angels, driven headlong into a dismal place, '-
which is called Hell.
The recital of this truth made my man give the
greatest attention, and he expressed a great satis-
faction by his gestures, that God had sent the de-
vil into the deep hole. And then I desired him to
give great heed to what 1 had further to say.
No sooner (proceeded I) was God freed from,
and the heavens clear of this arch-traitor, but the
Father speaks to the Son and Holy Spirit, who be-
longed to his essence, and,were equal to him in pow-
er and [glory, Come let us make man, .(said he) .
in our own image, after our own likeness, Gen. i. ',

tended should glorify him in heaven, according to
their obedience in this state of probation on earth

them tip for those heavenly mansions. Now Sa-
tan seeing himself foiled, yet that God had not ta-
ken the power from him as prince of the airr which
power Heaven designed he should retain, whereby
his creatures might be tried5 in revenge for the
disgrace he had received, he tempts Adam's wife
/Eve to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and
evil, which God had forbidden; He appears to
her in the shape oF £ serpent, then a most beauti-
ful creature, and tells her, that it was no better
than an imposition which God had put upon her
and her husband, not to eat of that fair fruit which
he had created; that the taste thereof would make
them immortal like God himself; and consequently
as great and «ppwerful as he. Upon which she not
'only eat thereof herself,-but made her husband eat
also, which brought .them both under the heaven-
ly displeasure. ,
Here Friday expressed a great concern; M~9
poor indnsl (cried he) -naughty womansl naughty
.devil! make God not love dt mans, make mans like,
dtvil himself. r f.
Friday, said I, God still loved mankind: and
though the devil tempted human nature so far, he
would not suffer him to have an Absolute power
over them. I have told*you before of his tender
love to his people, till they, like Lucifer, diso-
beyed his commands and rebelled against him ; and
; even then, how Jesus Christ, his only Son, came
to save,sinners. But: still every man that lives in
the world is under temptation and trial. The de-
yil has^yet a power, f as prince of the air, to sug-
gest evil cogitations into our minds, and prompt
us on to wicked actions, that he might glory in
our destruction. Whatever evil thoughts we have
proceed froni him; so that God, in this our di-
stress^expefts we should apply ourselves to him by
* ferveitt prayer for speedy redress. HetenotTike

. Benamucketyto let none come near him but Oow#<>

offer themselves at. his feet, thereby to be deliver-
ed from the power arid temptation of the devil.
But though at first my man Friday expressed
some concern at the wickedness of Lucifer, I found
it not so easy to imprint the right notions of him
•in his mind, as it1* was about the divine essence of
. God: for their nature assisted me in all my argu-
ments, to 4hew to him plainly the necessity of a
, great first cause, and over-ruling governing power,'
of a secret directing Providence,4 and of the equi-
ty and reasonableness of paying adoration to our
Creator,; whereas there appeared. nothing of all
this in the notion of an evil spirit, of his first be-
ginning, his nature, and above all, of his inclin-
.ation to evil actions, and his power to tempt us to
the like. And indeed this x unlearned Indian, by
the mere force of nature, puzzled me with one
particular question^ more than ever I could have
, expected.
I had, it seems, one day been talking to him of
the omnipotent power of God* and his infinite ab-
horrence.of sin, insomuch that the scriptures sty-
Jed him a consuming fire to all the workers of ini-
quity \ and that it was in his power, whenever he
pleased,- to destroy all the world in a moment,
thp greater par.t of which are continually offending
.huii,
, When, with a serious attention, he had listened -
a great while to what I said, after 1 had been tel-
ling him how the devil was God's enemy in the
hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill to
defeat the good design of Providence, and destroy
the kingdom of Christ in the world, and so forth t
^ Very well,, master, (said Friday>,) you say God is
£o strong, so great, is he not jtnuch, strong,, ranch
mightier than the naughty jievil? To bet furje, FrJr
;v . -  * _ • •-.'•* **y%
day, said I, God is more wife, and stronger than
the serpent: he is above the devil, which makes
us pray to him, that he would' tread down Satan
under our feet, enable us to resist his violent
temptations, and quench his fiery darts. Why then,
answered Friday quickly, if God, as you fay, has
much strong, much might as the devil, why- God no
kill devil, make nc more tempt, no more d$ wicked?
You may be certain I was strangely surprised at
this question of my man's; and tho' an old man,
1 was but a young doctor, and consequently very
ill qualified for a casuist, or a resolver of intricate >
doubts in religion. And as it required some time
for me to study for an answer,. 1 pretended not to
hear him, nor to alk him what he said: but so
earnest was he for an answer, as not to forget his
question, which he repeated in the very same bro-
ken'words as above. When I had recovered my*
self a little, Friday, said 1, Gad will at last punifj
him severely, being reserved fdr judgment, and is
to be cast into the bottomless fit, to remain in fire
everlasting. But all this did not satisfy Friday %
for returning upon' me, he repeated my words^
reserve At last, me no understand;. but why
not kill devil now, not kill devil,.great, great while,
ago P Friday, said I, you may as well ask me why
God does not kill you and me, when by our wicked
actions we {q much offend his Divine Majesty ? He
gives us time to repent of our sins, and thereby
we may obtain pardon. At these words, obtain
pardon, Friday mused a great whiles and at last*
looking me stedfastly in the face; Well well, said
he, that's very well; soyour I, devil, all wicked
mans, all preserve, repent God, pardon all.
indeed here I was run down to the last extremi-.
ty, when it became very evident to me, how mere
natural notions will guide reasonable creatures td*
%b$ knowledge of a Deity, and to the homage due?
M z
ta the supreme being of a God \ but however, no- 4
thing but divine revelation can form the know*;
ledge of Jesus Christ, and of a redemption pur-
chafed.for us, of the Mediator of ,the new cote-
nant, and of ait Intercessor at the footstool of
God's throne; and therefore the gospel of„,our

sahctifier of his people, are the jnost necessary in-
structors of the fouls of men, in the faying knpwn*
ledge of the Almighty, and the means, to attain?
eternal happiness* - ^ • ?.
And now I found it necessary to put an end to.
this discourse between my man and me; for which
purpose I rose up.hastily, and made as if I had
some- occasion to go out, .fending Friday for some- .
thing that was a good way off., I then fell on my >
knees, and beseeched God that- he- would;-inspire;
me so fit* as to guide the poor savage in,the know-*.•

ly, that his conscience might be convinced, his
eyes opened, and his foul saved. When \it rettirp-n
-€d again, I entered into a yery long discourse with*
him; lipon the subject of;the. world's redemption'
by the Saviour ofuty and the doctrine of repen-
tance preachdd from heaven, together with an "ho- •.
ly faith in our blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ i and
then I proceeded to explain "to him, according to

t\iki he caiiie only to the lost ffieep of the house of
Israel, and the like. God knows 1 had more sin-
cerity than knowledge in all * the ways I took for
this poor Indian's instruction ; and I > must acknow*
ledge^ what I believe everybody that acts upom
tfhc ftgie principle iwill find, that in laying heaveuM
. ;.-. ly
fy truths open before him, I informed and instruct-
ed myself in many things, that either I did not
know, or had not perfectly considered befbrer ft»
that however thts^ poor creature might be impro-*
ved, by my instruction, certain it is, that I myself-
had great reason to be thankful to Providence for
fending him to me. His company allayed my griefs
and made my habitation Comfortable; and when £
reflected, that* the'solitary life to which JL had been
fo lbn|r confined that made me to look further to-
wards heaveny by making me the instrument, un-
der Providence, to save the life, and for aught I-
know, the foul of this poor savage, by bringing
him to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, it caused a .
secret joy to spread through every part of my sous?
arid Is frequently rejoiced, that ever I was brought
into this place, which I once thought the most mi-
serable* part of the world. #
In this thaiikfulrframe of mind dies I afterwards*
continue, while I abode on the island; and for
three years did my man and I live in the greatest
enjoyment of happiness. . Indeed I believe the sa-
vage was as good a Christian as I; aud I hope we
were equally penitent; and such penitents as were
comforted arid'restored by God's Holy Spirit ;,for
now we had the word of the Lord to instruct us
in the right way, as much as if we had been onu
the Englisli shore.
By the constant application I made of the Scrip-
tures, as Iread them to my man Friday, I eai>
nestly endeavoured to make him understand every
part of it, as much as lay in my power. He
also," .on the other hand, by his very serious ques-
tions and inquiries, made me a much better pro-
ficient in scripture-knowledge than I should have
been by my own private reading and study. } must:
not omit another thing, proceeding from the ex-
perience I had in my retirement: it was that irt-
M 3^ finitej.
finite and inexpressible bjeflirig, the: knowledge of
God through Jesus Christy which wasrso pl^inasti
easy tobe understood, as immediately to direfkmeF
to carry on the great work of sincere repentance
for my fins,.and laying hold of a Saviour for?eter-
nal life, to a practical stated reformation, and obe-
dience to. all God's institutions, without the assist-
ance of a reverend arid orthodox divines and espe- ,
cially byf this, fame instruction, so to enlighten this,
fovage creature, as to- make hiniiso,good^Gbrisrl
tian as very few couldc exceed him. And there
was only this great thing wanting, that I.had no au-
thority to administer the holy sacrament, that hea-
venly participation of Christ's body and blopd |-
yet however we rested ourselvesiconcent, that God;
-wbuld accept1 our* desires, and according to ouj?;
faith have mercy ori usv !, , r j i'*
*"• But what we wanted ohevway was, made-up j 1*
another^ and that was universal peace in, our lit-
tle church. We had no disputes and wrangling*
about the nature and quality of the holy* blessedy
and undivided Trinity, no.niceties in doctrine,} for.
schemes of church-government; np.four and n*o~
'rose dissenters to impose more sublimated notions
upbn us, no pedant sophisters to confound us w;th
unintelligible mysteries: but, instead of all this*
we enjoyed the most certain guide to Heaven, that
is, the word of God; besides which, we had the
comfortable views of his Spirit leading us to the
truth, and making us both willing and obedient to
the instruction of his word. As the knowledge:
and practice of this are the principal means of-sal-
vation, I cannot see what it avails any; Christan,
church, or man, in the world, to amule himself
with speculations and opinions, except it be to dis-
play their particular vanity and affectation. »>:i
You may well suppose, that, by the frequent
discourse we had together, my man and me be-
_ came

c$me most intimately acquainted, and that ?there
was but very little tha,t L€0111(1/3,7, butfwhat Fri-
day understood: and indeed,he, fppke very.fluently,
though it was,but bjjjken. English. I now took a
particular, pleasure in relating all my adventures,
especially those that occurred since my being cast
on this island. ;I, made him understand jthat^won-
derful mystery, as he conceived, of gun powder
and bullet, and taught, him how to shoots ^alfb
presented ia him. a, knife, 1 which pleased him- ex-
ceedingly, making.hhn a belt, with atfrog hanging
thereto, like those in which we wear hangers in
England; and instead of a hanger to put in the
frqgv I gave him a hatchet, which was not Quly a
gQpd, but gven a better,weapon Upon many occa-
sions,^ In a word, my man thusfaccquteretl, look-
ed upon J^imielf as great as Don Quixote, .when,
that celebrates champion went to combat the wind-
mill./ ; , / ^ .' • .
Inext gave him a very particular description of
th^4|erritQries of ^Europe, and in a particular
mannertQfrOid;^£ngland, the.place of my nativity*
J laidbefore him the manner of pur worshipping
God, -our behaviour .one to another, and how wq
trade in (hips to; every part-in the universe. I
then told him my misfortunes in being fhipwreck-
eds fhowjng him, as, npar as J could, the. place
where the ship lay,^ which had been gone long be-
fore: but I brought him to/tae ruins of my boat$
which before my, whole strengili could not move,
but now Ayas almost rotten, and fallen to pieces^
I .observed my man Friday to viesw this boat with
an uncommon curiosity 5 which when he had donef
he stood pondering a great while, and said nothing.
At last, said I, Friday, what makes you ponder so
much*? Pe replied, 0 Master, me see like boat con%e
to peace qt my nation. <
- It was fortes time indeed before I understood
. ;,  what
what my man meant; but examining strickly into'
it, r plainly found, that stich another boat* re-
sembling mine had come upon the country where4
He dwelt; that ts tp*k}\™hy*bis<farther explana-*
tion, that the boa^was driven there through vio-
lent storms and stress of weather. It then came*
into my mind, that some European ship having been-
castaway, the poor distressed creatures were for-
ced to have recourse to the boat to save their lives;
and being all, as" I thought, drowned*, Inever con-
cerned myself to ask any thing concerning them,. •
but my only inquiry was about the boat, and what:
description my man could give of it.
Indeed Friday answered my demands very well^
making every thing very plain to mf understand-
ing; but beyond measure was I satisfied; when he
 told me, with great warmth and ardour, OMaster^.
we save white mans from dr&wn $ upon which I!
immediately asked him, if there were any white-
mans, as he called them, in the boat; ¥es, yesr
said he, the boat full, very full of white mans* How-
many, Friday? said I, hereupon he numbered hisv
fingers, and counted seventeen. And when Task-
ed him,what became of them all^ and whether they-
lived or not? he replied, Yes master, they zlllive^
they be live among my nation. This information:
put fresh thoughts into my head, that these must be
those very men who before I concluded had been
swallowed up in the ocean after they had left their
ship, that had struck upon the rocks of my Icings
dom, and after escaping the fury of the deep, land-
ed upon the wild more,, and committed themselves^
to the fury of these devouring Indians;
The manner of their cruelties to one another,-
which consequently, as I thought, must be acted
with greater barbarity to strangers, created4n me
a great anxiety, and made me still more curious
to ask Friday concerning them $ he told me he was-
sure.*
sure they still lived there,, having resided among*
theify above sour years, and that die savages gave
them,.victuals to live upon. But pray, Friday,,
said 1, whence prp^^eded-alLthis good nature and,
generosity ? How came it to pass that they did not;
kill and eat them, to please their devouring, appe-
tites, 5 and /occasion so- splendid an entertainment
araoug them? No, no said Friday,, they not kill
9en%r they make brother, wilfi^em^by which I un-
derstood there was a truce rbet>veen them. , And
then; I had a more favourable opinion of the Indi-r
ans, upon FridayVuttering*these words. My na*

: Spnip considerable tiine after, upon a very plea*
ftnt day> in most serene weather, my man apd I;
stood upon the top of a hill, on the east side of,
the ifland, whence-1 had once before beheld tbe|
Continent of America* I cpuld not t^U immediately;
\yhat was the matter; for suddenly Friday, fell as
jpmping and dancing as if he had be^n mad; and-
upon-my demanding the reason of his behaviour,?
Q jov, Taid he, 0 glad! there fee my country, theret
my nation, there live white mans gether. And in-(
djeed sueh a xapturpus sepse qf pleasure appeared
ip his* countenance* .that his eyes had:an Uncom^
ipofc spark)ilittf ai\d; brightness,': and*such; a slrafige"
eag£rnels,-as if he hfid. a Jopgipg desire tabe inhis>
4wn Country again. This piade me not so well;
satisfied with my man Friday as before; for, by
tjiis appearance, I made no dispute, but that if heS
could get back thither again, he would not only
he unniindfui;of jwh^t religion I had taught IspnU
bu€ likewise of the great obligation be owed me
for his,wonderful deliverance : nay, that he would
not only inform his country-men of'me, but ac*
company hundreds of them to my kingdom, and
make me a miserable sacrifice like those unhappy
wretches taken in battle.
-. Indeed I was very much to blame tafrave these"
cruel and unjust suspicions, arid must freely own;
I wronged the poor creature very much, wha was
of a quite contrary temper. And had he had that'
discerning acuteness which many Europeans havey
he would certainly have perceived my coldness
and indifference, and also have been very much
concerned upon that account; as I was now more;
circumfpected, I had much lessened my kindness
and familiarity with him, arid while this jealousy
continued, I used that artful way (now too much
in fashion, the occasion of strife and dissension) of
Eumpinghim daily, thereby to discover whether •
e was deceitful in his thoughts and inclinations:
but certainly he had nothing in him but what was
'consistent with the best principles, both as a reli-
gious Christian and a grateful friend,; and indeed
I found every thing he said was so ingenuous and:
innocent, that I had no room for suspicion; aridt
in spite of all uneasiness, he not only made me.
entirely his own again, but also caused me much»
to lament that I ever conceived one ill thought of
him.
As we were7 walking up* the fame hill another*
day, when the weather was so ha-zy at sea, that I
could not perceive the continent, Friday, said'l*,
don't you wish yourself to be in your own coun-
try, your own nation, among your old friends and
acquaintances? Yes> said he, me much 0 glad to bc>
at myy own nation* And what would you do there,
Friday? Would you turn wild again eat man's5
fleih, and be a savag;e as. you were formerly? No>
no*
no, (answered he, full of concern, and shaking
his head,) Friday now tell them to live good, tell
4hem -pray God, tell them to eat corn bread, cuttle
fie/h, milk, w eat man again. But surely, replied
I, if you should offer to do all this, they will kill
you, and to manifest their contempt of such instruc-
tion, eat you up when they have *done. He then
put on a grave, yet innocent and smooth cotmte-
Vnance, saying, No, they no kill me, they willing
Jove* learn: that is, that they would be very wil-
ling, to learn : adding withal, that they had learn*
\td much df the bearded mans that come in the boat*
Will you, said I, go back again, Friday? tie smi-
led at that, and told me, that he could not* swim
so far. But* said I, I will make a canoe for you:
Y$s, Master, said he, me go if you go, me no go if
you stay t I go, Friday! why, would you have
them eat me up, and devour your kind master?
No, no, said he, me make them mt eat master, mi
make they much love you; that is, he would tell
them how I had stain his enemies, and thereby la-
ved his life, for which reason he would make them
love, me: and then he related to me, as well as he
-was able, how exceeding kind those of his nation
were to the white, or bearded men, as he called
them, who, in their great calamity, were driven
into their country.
,, It was from this time, indeed, I had strong in-
clinations to venture over, and use my utmost ef-
forts, if possible, to" join these white-bearded men,
who undoubtedly were Spaniards or Portuguese;
for thought I,- it must be certainly a better and
safer way to escape when there is a gdod company,'
than for me alone, from an island forty miles off
the shore, and without any assistance. Some days
after, Friday and I being at,work, as usual, at the'
same time diverting ourselves with Various discour-
ses, I told him I had a boat which I would bestow
.' upon
iipon him, whenever he pleased to t*eturri?to his
own nation: and to convince hi hi of the truth of
what I said, I took him with me to the othei4 side
of the island, where my frigate lay, and then ta-
king it from under the water,* (for I always kept
it funk for fear of a discovery) we boih went in-
to it to see how it would manage such an fexpedi-
"tion. ''' _  .'. v>   ;;r"
'And really never could any be more dexterous
in rowing than my faithful servant, making the
boat go as fast again as I could. Well} how, BYi-
*day, said 1, shall we now go to your so much de-
sired nation? But instead of meeting with that
"chearfulness I expected, he looked very dull and
; melancholy at my saying so; which indeed at first
surprised me, till he made me sensible, that his
concern was about the boat's being too small to
go so far a voyage. Upon which 1 let him under-
stand I had a much bigger; arid accordingly the
next day went to the place where the firstboat
lay, which I had made, when all the strength I
Tiad, or art I could use, failed me in my attempt
to get it into'the water; but now iti having kin ih
the sun two and twenty years^ and no care being
taken of it all that while, it became in a manner
rotten. My man told me, that such a boat would
do very well to the purpose, sufficient to carry
enough vittlc, dring, bread, for that was his -man-
ner of talking. In short, my mind being strong-
ly fixed upon my design of going over with him
; to the continent, I very plainly told him, that We
would both go and make a boat fiill_as big, arid
more proportionable than that, wherein he might
safely return to his own nation.
These words made Friday look so very pensive,
that I thought he would have fallen at my feet.
It wa,s some time before he could sjpeak a word,
'which made me alk him what was the matter with
.*-• him?
or R &31 NS ON CRU$0 E, ±4$

What hm $Mr Friday d&ne? why are- you angry?

not you wish to be there when from a mountain*

if not to satisfy your desires that lam willing. to>
give you leave to return thkher? Yes*, yet, /hid

rather live' in thia solitude than venture among
such inhuman' savagesi Go your way, since you
desire* it, and leave me alone by myself, afc I was
before I* saved your life;
Never was any creature more thunder-struck
than Friday was at these w.ords; Go me away$
leave master away, said he, after a long, silence^
wo, noix Friday die,% Friday live not, master gone;
as though lie hadsaidi i neither can nor will live,
. . n ' if
if ray master sends me from him. And here I can-
not but take notice of the strong ties of friend-
ship which many times surpass those of consangul?"
nity: for oftefi we find a great disagreement a-
niong kindred; and when there is any seeming re-
gard for each other, it is very seldom true, and
scarce ever lasting, if powerful interest does not
bear the sway; and that alone is^ often the occa-^
sion of the greatest hatred in the world, which is
to desire the deaths of parents and relations, for'
the fake of acquiring their fortunes: but there
was no such thing between my servant and me:
instead of which there was the greatest gratitude,
and the most "sincere love; he found me not only
his deliverer, but his preserver and comforter;
not a severe and cruel tyrant, but a kind, loving,
and affable friend. He wanted for no manner of
sustenance; and when he was ill, or out of drder,
I was his physician, not only for hss body, but
his foul; and therefore no wonder was it, that
such-ah innocent creature, long since divested of
his former natural cruelty, should have an un-
common concern at so cruel a separation from nie^
which •pierced him to the very soul, and made him
desire even to die, rather than live without me.
After I had told Friday, in a very careless man-
'ner, thathe sliould:be at his liberty as soon as the
boat was made, the language of his eyes expressed
all imaginable confusion; when immediately run-
ning to one of his hatchets, which he used to wear
as a defensive weapon, he gives it into my hand,1
with a heart so full, that he could ^scarcely speak.
Friday, said I, what is it you mean? what must I
do with this? Only kill Friday, said he, Friday
care not live long. But what must I kill you for?
replied I again. Ah! dear-master, ivhat made you
Friday save fromeat a me up, so keep ioifg Friday ±
make Friday love God and not love BeHamuckeei
.'.-.' and
and now Friday.send away, never see Friday more*
As though the poor creature had said, Alas,-my*
dearest kind master* how comes it to pass, that
aster having ventured your precious life to savd
me from the jaws of the devouring cannibals like
myself, after such,a tender regard to provide for
me such a comfortable nourishment, and' continu-
ing so long a kind master, and a most sincere?
friend; and after making me forsake the false .no-
tion of an Indian Deity, and worship the\true
God in spirit and in truth: after all this, how
comes it now, that you are willing to fend me a-
way to my former course of living, by which means*
undoubtedly we (hall be dead to each other; but
greater .must be my misfortune, thati shall never1
behold my best friend I have in the world any more*.
And this undoubtedly, though he could not express
"himself so clearly, must be hh sentiments; for tl^e
jtears ran down his cheeks in such a plentiful man-
ner, that I had much ado to refrain from weeping
also when I beheld - the poor creature's affection;
so that I was forced to comfort him/in the best
manner I could, which I did, by telling him, if
he was content to abide with me, iihould be ever
willing to keep him.
After Friday's grief was something abated, more*
fully to convince me of his affection, he said, U
master, me not care to be in my nation, leave you
here; me desire nation learn good, thass all;
meaning, |that his desire was for the conversion of
that barbarous people. Btit as I had no apostolic
mission, nor any concern about their salvation, so
*I had not the least intention or desire of under-
taking it: and the strength of my inclination, in,
order to escape, proceeded chiefly from my late
discourse with Friday, about these seventeen white*
bearded men that had been driven upon the bar-
barian coast, whom I designed to join, as the on-
N 2 ly
Jy m^aps to further our escape. To which intent
my man and I went to iJeami for a -proper tree to
fell, whereof we .might make a large periagua or
canoe, to undertake the voyage; and indeed we
nyere not long-in folding one fit for our. purpose,/
tihere being enough of wood in the island tp have
Unlit a >fle,ejt of large vessels, but the thing we
principally waited was, to get one Co near thie
syater^ that M^e might launch it after it was finish-
ed, janxUiot commit so horrid a mistake as I had
cjpjie cp£e before.
. Well, after a great search for what wa$ best
ind most convenient, Friday at last, whose judge-
ment in such affairs y/$s much superior to mine,
pitches upon a kind of wood the most fitting for
i£. Toidiis day I cannot tell the name of the
tree^ <&pr. describe it any other way, than only
by %j% tfesc it Is rcrj like what we call fustic j.
©r betwixt that and the Nicaragua wood, being
much .of the fame colour and smelL But though
my man exceeded me in the knowledge of the
most proper tree, yet I shewed him a mudh better
and cleaner way to make a canoe than ever he knesr
before i for he was for burning the hollow or car
vity of the tree, in order to make this boat; but
Ithtn told him how we might do it with tools,
learning him at the fame time how to nse them,
.which indeed he did very,dexterously; so that ia
a month's labour we finished it, making ?it very
handsome, by cutting the outside into the true
sliape of a boat. After this it took ms a full fortr
night before we could get her into the water,
^which, we did, as it were, inch by inch, upoa
great rollers: but when she was hi, slie would
have carried twenty men; with all the ease imar
ginable.
Asl was very well pleased, you may be sure,
at thelaunching of this man of w.ar of mine, I was,
sto less amazed to behold with- what dexterity my
man would manage her, turn her, and paddle her
along. -Well,--Friday, said I, what do'you think*
of it now? Do'you thjnk this will carry us over?
Yes, Master, said he, "me venture over well, though
great blow wind* But my design was yet farther,,
which he was insensible of; and that was to make
a mast and fail, and to provide her with an anchor
and cable. As to a mast, that was no difficult
thing at all to procure; so I fixed upon a straight
young cedar-tree, which I found near the place,,
great plenty of it abounding in the island; and set-
ting Friday to, cut it down, /1 gave him particular
directions how to shape and order it; but as to the
sell, that I managed myself. I very well knew £
had some old ones, or pieces of sails enough, which
had lain six and twenty years by me; but not be*
gin careful to preserve them, as thinking I should
have no occasion to use them any more, when I
came to look them over, I found them* almost all
rotten, except two; and with these Iwenj: to work,
and after a great deal of pains and awkward tedi- ,
ous stitching for want of needles, at length I finished
t;hree'cornered ugly thing, like what we call in Eng-
land a shoulder of mutton sail, to go with a boom
at bottom, and a little small'sprit at the top, like
those which our longboats useT and which I very,
well knew how to manage: especially since it was
like that which I had in my patron's fishing boatr
when with my boy Xury I made my escape from
the Barbarian more*
It was near two months, I think, before I com*
pleated this work, that is, the rigging, and fitted1
my mail and fails; and indeed they* were nicely
done, having made a.small stay, and a sail, or fore-
fail to it, to assist, if we mould turn to the west-
ward; and, which was still more, I fixed a rudder
to the stern of her, to steer with;, and though L
N 3, was
was'but a very indifferent shipwright, yet, as I
was scnsibje of jt^e great usefulness and absolute
necessity of a thing like this, I applied myself to-it
with such a constant application, that at last I ac-
complished my design: but what with the many
dull contrivances I had about it, and the failure of
many things, it cost me as much pains in ordering
as in making the boat- Besides, when all this was
done, I had my man to-teach what belonged to its
navigation: for though he very well understood
how to paddle a canoe along, he was an utter stran-
ger to a fail and rudder, and was amazed when
he saw me work the boat to and again in the sea,
by them, and how the sail gibbed and filled this
way or that way, as the course we sailed changed.
After some time, and a little use, I made all these
things very familiar to him, so that he became an
expert sailor, except in relation to the compass,
and that I could make him understand but little of.
But as it hapenned, there was seldom occasion for
it, there being but little cloudy weather, and scarce
ever any fog in those parts; the stars were always
visible in the night, and the (bore perspicuous by
day, except in the rainy -season, which confined
every one to his habitation.
Thtis entered in the seven and twentieth year
of my reign, or captivity, which you please, (the
last three of which, blessed with the company of
my man Friday, ought not to be reckoned, j I kept
the anniversary of my landinghere, with tne same
thankfulness to God, for his tender mercies, as I
did before; and certainly, as I had great cause for
a thankful acknowledgment for my deliverance at
first, I had much greater now, for such singular and
additional testimonies of the care of Providence over
me, in all my distresses, both of body and mind^ and
the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedi-
ly delivered; for I had a ctr-jang impression upon my
mindj.
mind, that I should not be another year in this
island. But, however, I .still conUfhied on with my
husbandry, digging, planting, and fencing, as usual;
gathering and curing my grapes, and doing all other
things that were neceflary.
And now the rainy season beginning to come
on, obliged me to keep the longer within doors 5
but before this, I brought my new vessel into the
creek, where I had landed my rafts from the ship,
and haling her up to the shore, I ordered my man
Friday to dig a dock sufficient to hold her in, and
deep enough to give her water, wherein she might
float; and then, when the tide was out, we made
a strong dam cross the end of it, to keep out the
water; by which means she lay dry, as to the
tide from the sea j and to keep the rain from her,
we thatched her over, as it were, with boughs of
trees, like a house 5 and so we waited for the
months of November and December, in which I
designed to venture over the ocean.
No sooner did the seasonable weather begin to
draw near, but so much was I elevated with this
new designed adventure, that I daily prepared for
the voyage. The first thing I thought oh was, to
Jay by a certain quantity of provisions, as a suf-
ficient store for such%an expedition, intending in a
week or fortnight's time to open the dock, and
launch out the boat for that purpose. But one
morning as I was very busy upon something neces-
sary for this occasion, I called Friday to me, and
bid him go to the sea-shore, and see if he could
find a turtle or tortoise, a thing which we com*
monly had once a week, as much upon aecount of
the eggs, as for the fake of the flesh, He had not
been long gone, but he came running back, as
though he was pursued for life, and as if were flew
over my outward w'all,- or fence, like one that
felt not the ground, or steps, he set his feet on;
and
and before! had time to enquire the reason of his-
precipitation, henries out, 0 dear master, Osar-
row! sorrow! Bad! Obad! Why, what's the mat-
ter, Friday .^seid I; 0 yonder, yonder, said her
there be one, two, or three canoes I two, three.
Surely (thought I) there must be fix, by my man's
way of, reckoning; but, on a stricter inquiry I
found there were but three. Well, Friday, said
I, don't be terrified, I warrant you we will not,
only defend ourselves against 'em; but kill the
most of ,thesc cruel savages. But though I com-
forted him in the best manner I could, the poor
creature trembled ib, that I scarce knew what £0
do with him: 0 master\ said he, they come look
Friday, cut pieces Friday, cut a me up. Why,,
Frida}', saicf I, they will eat me up as well as you,
and my danger is as great as yours. But since it-
is so, we must resolve to fight for our lives. What-
fay you? can you fight, Friday? Yes said he very
faintly, mestoot, me kill what I can, but there come,
greatmany number. That's no matter, said I again,,
pur guns will terrify those that we do not kill a
I am very willing to stand by you to the last drop-
of my blood? now tell me, if you will do thelike
bv me, and obey my orders in whatsoever I com-
mand? Friday then answered* 0 master,, me lost*
life for you, me die when you bid die. Thus con-*
eluding all questions concerning his. fidelity, im-
mediately I fetched him a .good dram: of rum, (of
which I had been a very good husband,) and gave
it him to comfort his heart. After he had drank
it, I ordered him to take the two fowling pieces,.,
which we always carried*'and load them with large
swan mot, as big as small pistol bullets 5. then J
took four muskets, and loaded them with.two flags,
and five small bullets each, charging my two pis-
tols each with a brace. I hung; my .great sword,
as customary, naked to my side, and gave Friday
- his
bis 'hatchet, as a most excellent weapon for defence.
Thus prepared, I thought as well of myself a&
any knight^errant that ever Handled a sword and
spear. I took my perspective glass, and went tip
to the side ^>f the hill, to fee what I could disco-*
ver; and I perceived very soon, by the glass, that
there were one and twenty savages, three prison-
ers, and three canoes; and that their chief con**
oerai seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon
the three poor human bodies; a thing which by
this time I had observed was (very-common with
them* I also remarked, that they did not ilaod at
that place from whence Friday sraade his escape,
but nearer to the creek, where thesliore was low,
and where a thick wood came very close to the
sea* My soul was then filled with indignation and
abhorivence at such 'inhuman wretches, which put
a period to all my former thoughts in their via*
dication: neither would I give myself time to con*
lider tibeir right of conquest, as I had done (before;
hut descending from* the mountain, I came down
t<o Friday, and told him, I was resolved to go
speedily to ttbem and kill them all; aMng him a#
gain, m the same breath, if the would ^fiand by me?
When lay this time beisg recovered fre-m hi* fright,
aiad hissjsrk anuch cheered wkh the dmm I had
given him, he was very pleasant, yet seriously tel-
Ungme,Ws hedidfeefore, When Ibid die, he would
die.
And now it was, having fixed my resolution in
so slr-ang* manner, that nothing could digest my
breast jof its uncommon fury, 1 immediately di*
vided the loaded arms betwixt us. To my man
Friday 1 gave a pistol to -stick in his girdle, with
three guns upon his ilioulder, a weight too great
I confess to bear; but what must a poor king do,
who had but qne soldier in the world? But to
fliew I mvde him be#r no naore thim what I wv&H
lay
lay on myself, I stuck the other pistol in my girdle,,
and other three guns upon my shoulders; nay*
. something more, but that was like Æsop's burdenr
a small bottle of rum, which was soon lightened
to our exceeding refreshment. Thus we marched
out, under a ponderous load of armour, like twa
invincible* champions, with a quantity of powder
and bullets to stand our battle, and load again,
when the pieces were discharged. And now my
orders being to be obeyed, I charged Friday to
keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or
attempt any thing till I commanded him; and, in
the interim, not to speak so much as one word.
. It was in this order I fetched a compass to the right
hand, of near a mile, as well to get over the creek,
as to attain the wood; by this I thought to come
Vithin shot of them before I could be discerned;
as I found by my glass would not be difficult to ac^
complifh.
But how fickle and wavering is the. mind of
men* even in our greatest fury and strongest in-
clination? For while I was talcng this march, my
resolution Began to abate, not through fear of
their numbers, who were a parcel of naked un-
armed wretches, but those reflections occurred to
my thoughts; What power was I commissioned
with, or what occasion or necessity had I to go
and imbrue my hands in human blood, and murder
'people that had .neither done nor intended to.,do
me any wrong? They were innocent in particu-
lar as to me; and their barbarous custom was not
only their misfortune, but a sign that God bad
left them in the most immense stupidity; but yet
did not warrant me to be a judge of their actions,
much less a% executioner of his righteous judg-
ments; that, on the contrary, whenever, he thought
fit, he would take vengeance on them himself, and
puniih them-in a national way,, according to them
national
national crimes; but that was nothing at all to mej
who had no concern with them. Indeed my man
Friday might justify himself, because they were his
declared enemies, of that very fame nation that
went to sacrifice him1>efore, and indeed it was
lawful for him to' attack them, which I could not
fay was so with respect to me. So warmly did
these things press upon my thoughts all the way I
went, that I only resolved to place iriyselfso as
to behold their bloody entertainment, without
falling upon them, except something more than
ordinary, by God's special direction, ihould oblige
me thereto.'
Thus fixed in my resolution, I entered in the
thick wood, (my man Friday following me close
behind,) when with all possible weariness and silence
I marched till I came to the skirt of it, on that
side which was the nearest to them; for only one
end of the wood interposed between me and them.
Upon which I called very softly to Friday, and
shewing him a great tree, that^was just at the cor-
ner of the wood, I ordered him to repair thither,
and bring me word, if he could plainly perceive
their actions: Accordingly, he did,as I Command-
ed him, and came back with this melancholy story,
that they were all about their fire, eating the flesh
of one of their prisoners; and that another lay
bound upon the sand, a little distant from them,
which they designed for their next sacrifice; and
this, he told me, was not one of their nation^
. but one of those very bearded men, who wa3 dri-
ven by a storm into their country, and of whom
he had so often talked to me ab6ut. You may "be
sure, that upon hearing this, my foul was ready
to sink within me; when ascending up into a tree,
I saw plainly by my glass, a white man, who lay
upon the beach of the sea, with his hands and feet
ty'd with flags, or things resembling ruslies, be-
|5<? LIIE *n d AI>VE«N:TUItES
ingj covered with cloaths*, and seemed to* be an
^European* From the tree where: I took this pro-
spects I perceived another tree, and a thicket be-
yond it*; about fifty yards nearer to them, than
where I wa^j which, by taking a small circle
round, I might come at undiscovered,, and then*I
sliould be within half a shot oft these devourers*
And this consideration alone, to be more per-
fectly revenged uponi them, made me with-hold my
passion,, though I was enraged' to the- highest de-
gree imaginable; when-going back about twenty
paces, I got behind' some bushes, which held all
the way tilL t came to the other tree; and then;!* a*
seendedi ta a* little rising grounds not above eigh-
teen yards distance, and therq I»hadra full view of
these creatures,, and 1 could perceive all their ac-
tions.
Such a sigjit did then appear, as* obliged me not?
to lose a moment's time. No lefk than nineteen
.of these* dreadful* wretches sot upon the ground}
close, huddled together, expressing all the delight
imagi;nabl& at fa barbarous* an entertainment; and
they had just font other two to murder this poor
unhappy Christian*, and*bring him limb by limb to
their fire; for they were just then going, to untie
the bands from his feet, in order for deaths as-set*
ters are knocked off the feet of malefactors before
they go to the ..place of execution. ^ Hereupon^
immediately turning to my man, Now, Friday,
said J* minds what I say,* fail in nothing, but do
exactly as you fee me- do* All which he promising
he would perform^ I set downi one of my mulkets*
and the fowling-piece upon the grounds and Friday
did the fame by his; and with the other musket I
took ray aim at the savages, bidding him do the
like: Are you ready, said I? Yes, master, said he;
Why then fire at them, said I; and that very mo*
ment I gave fire likewise.
I only
I only killed one, and wounded two; but i?iy man
"Friday, taking his aim much better than I, killed
two, and wounded three. You may be sure they
^were in a dreadful consternation, at such an un-
expected disaster; and those who yet had escaped
, our penetrating shot, immediately jumped upon
their feet, but were.in such confusion, that they
knew not which way to run or look, not knowing
from whence their destruction came, We then
threw down our pieces, and took up others, giv-
ing a second dreadful volley; but as they wefe
loaded only with svvan-fhot; or small pistol bullets,
we perceived only two of them fall; though ma-
ny were wounded, who run yelling and screaming
'about like friad creatures. Now Friday, said 1,
lay down your piece, and take up the musket, and
follow me. ^He did so, with great courage, when
shewing ourselves to the savages, we gave a great
shout, and made directly to the poor victim, who
would have been sacrificed, had not our first fire*
obliged the butchers, with three others, to jump
into a canoe. By my order, Friday fired at them,
at which shot I thought he had killed them all, by
reason of their Tailing to the bottom of the boat;
however, he killed two, and mortally wounded a
third. In the mean time, I cut the flags that tied
the hands and feet of the poor creature, and lift-
ing him up, asked him in the Portuguese tongue,
What he -was? He answered me in Latin, Chrifti-
anus; but so very weak and saint, that he could .
scarce stand or speak. Immediately I gave him a
dram, and a piece of bread to cherish him, and ask-
ed him what countryman he was? He said, E/par
; niola, and then uttered all the thankfulness imagina-
ble for his deliverance. Signior, (said I with as
much Spanish as I was master of,) let us talk after-
wards, but fight now; here,, take this sword and
pistol, ^and do what you can. And indeed he did
O fo
so with such courage and intrepidity, that he cut
two of them to pieces in an instant, the savages
not having the power to fly for their lives. I or-
dered Friday to run for those pieces we had left at
phe tree, which he brought me with great swift-
ness, and then I gave him my musicet, while I load-
ed the rest. But now there happened a fierce en*-
counter bet ween the Spaniard and one of the sava-
ges, who had made at him wirh one of their wooden
swords; and though the, former was as brave as
could.be expected, having twice wounded his ene-
my in the head; yet, being weak and faint, the In-
dian had thrown him upon the ground, and was
wresting my sword out of his hancj* which the
Spaniard very Wifely quitting, drew out his pistol,
and shot; him through the body before I could crime
near him, though, I was running to his assistance.
As to Friday, he pursued the. flying wretches with
Ills hatchet, dispatching three, but the rest,were
too nimble for him. The Spaniard taking one of
the fowling-pieces, wounded two, who running in-
to the wood, Friday pursued and killed one; but
the other, notwithstanding his 1wounds, plunged
himself into the sea, and swam to those two who
were left in the canoe, which, with one wounded,
were all that escaped out of one and twenty. The
account is as follows: .

The savages in the canoe worked very hard to
, get
get out os our reach, and Friday was as eager in
pursuing them; and indeed I Was no less anxious
about their escape, left after thejiews had been
carried to their people, they should return in mul-
jdtudes, aftd destroy us. So being resolved to pur-
sue them, I jumped into one of their canoes, anp!
bid Friday follow me; but no sooner was I in,
than, to my surprise, I found another poor crea-
ture, bound hand and foot for the slaughter, just
as the Spaniard had been, with very Httle life iii
him. Immediately 1 unbound him, and would have
helped Trim up; but he could neither stand nor
speaks but groaned so piteonsly, as thinking he
was only unbound in order to be stain. Hereu-
pon 1 bid Friday speak to him and tell him of his
deliverance; when pulling out my bottle, I-made
the poor wretch drink a dram, which, with the
joyful news he had received, so revived his hearts
that he set up in the boat. As soon as Friday be-
gan td hear him speak, and look more fully in his
face, it would have moved any one to tears tcj
perceive his uncommon transports of joy; for he
kissed, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed
hallooed, jumped about, danced, lung, then cried
again, wrung his hands, beat his face and head,
* then fung and jumped about again, like a distrac-
ted creature: so that it was a great while'before
I could make him speak to me, or tell me what
was the matter with him: but when he came to-
the liberty of his speech, at la$ he told me it was
his father, - " :'
Here indeed I was infinitely. moved to fee that
dutiful and tender affection this poor savage had
to his aged parent. He would lit down by him it*
the boat, open his breast, and hold his father's
head close to bis bosom, half an hour together^ to
cherish it; then he took his arms and ancles,
which were stiff and numbed with binding, and
O 2 chaffed
chaffed and rubbed them with his hands,; by which
means perceiving what the cafe was, J gave him
some rum, which proved of great benefit to him..
While we were busy in this action, the savages
bad gotten, aimed out of fight; and happy it was
we did not pursue them rfor there arose-from the
nortli-west, which continued all night long, such
a violent storm, that I could not suppose otherwise
but that they were all drowned* After this, I call-
ed Friday to me, and asked him if-he-had given his.
father any bread? He shook his head, and said,
None, not one bit, me eat a up all? so J gave him
a cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried for-
this end. I likewise gave him a drain for himself,
vand two or three bunches of raisins for his- fa*
ther. Both these he carried to him, for he wpuld
make him drink the dram to comfort him. -r
Away he then runs out of the boat as if he wa$
bewitched, with such an extraordinary swiftness,
that he was out of sight as it were in an instant i
but at his return I perceived him slacken his-pace,
because he had something in his hand.. And this
I found to be; as he approached nearer, an earth?
ca,jug.with some water to his, father, with two
more cakes of bread, which h^ delivered into my
hands/ Being very thirsty myself, I drank some
of the water, of which when his fatlier had drank
sufficiently, it more revived his spirits than all the
run* I had given him.
I then called Friday to me,, and ordered him to
carry the Spaniard one of the cakes, kand sonj$
water, who was reposing himself up0n a green
place under the shade of a tree> b\\t so jweak, thai
thpugh he exerted hjmself, he could not stand upon
his fee£ Upon which 1 ordered Friday to rub and
bathe his ancles with rum, as he did Ijis father's*
But every minute he was employed in this, hg
would cast a wishful eye towards the boatj where
. . he
he left his father sitting; who suddenly disappear-
ing-, he flew like lightning to him, arid finding he on-
ly laid himself down to ease his limbs, he return-
ed back to me presently; and then I spoke to the
Spaniard to let Friday help him, and lead him to
the boat, in order to be conveyed to my dwelling,,
where I would take care of him. Uporr which,
Friday took him upon'his back, and so carried hint
t"0 the canoe, setting him close by his father; and
presently stepping out again, launched the boat off,
and paddled it along the shore faster than I could
walk, though the wind blew very hard too: and1
haping^ brought them safe to the creek, away he
runs,to fetch the other canoe; which he brought
to the* creek almost as soon as I got to it by land ^
when wafting me over, he took our new guests*
out of the boat ^ but so weak were they> that I
was forced to make a kind of a hand-barrow j and
when I came to my castle, not being willing to
.«iake an entrance into my wall, we made them a
handsome tent, covered with old sails, and bought
of trees, making two good beds of rieevstrawr
with blankets to lye upon and cover them. Thus-,
like an absolute king, over subjects who owed
their lives to me, I thought myself very confide^
rable, especially as- I had now three religions in
riiy kingdom, my man Friday being a Protestant,/
his father a Pagan, and the Spaniard a* Papists
but I gave liberty of conscience to them all-.
To get provisions for my poor weak subjects, I
ordered Friday to kill me a yearling goat; which,
when he had done, I cut t>fF the hinder quarters,,
£nd chopping it into small pieces,, boiled and stew*
ed it, putting barley and rice into the broth;
This I carried into' their tent, set a tables dined
with them myself, and encouraged them. Friday
was my interpreter to his father, and indeed to
tke Spaniard too, who spoke the language of the-
'O j savages
ftvages pretty well. After dinner I ordered Frl~,
day to fetch home1 all pur arms from the field of
battle, and the next day to bury the dead bodiesr
which he did accordingly.
And now 1 made Friday inquire of his father
whether lie thought those savages had escaped the-
late storm in their canoe $ and if so, whether they
would not return with a power, too great for us
to' relist? Hfc answered, that he thought it rm-
possible they could outlive the storm.; or if they
were driven southwardly^ they would come to a
land where they would as certainly be devoured,,
as if they were drowned in the sea. And suppose
• they had attained their own country, the strange-
ness of their fatal and bloody attack, would make
them tell their people, that the rest of them were/
killed by thunder and lightning; not" by the hatuk
of man, but by two heavenly spirits (meanings
Friday and me) who were sent from above to de-
stroy them. And this, he said, he knew, because,,
heheard them say the same to one another* And
indeed he was in the right on't $ for I have heard
since, that these four men gave out, that whoever
went into that inchanted island, would be destroy-
ed by fire from the gods.
No canoes appearing some time after, as I ex-
pected, my apprehension ceased: Instead of'which
my former thoughts of a voyage took place, espe-
cially when Friday*s father *affured me I should
have good usage in his nation. As to the Spani-
ards U& told me, that; sixteen more of his country-,
ment and Portuguese, who had been shipwrecked,,,
made their escape thither j that though they were,
in union with - the savages, yet they were very,
miserable for want of provision and other neces-
saries. When I asked him about the particulars
of his voyage, he answered, that their ship was^
bound from Rio de la Plasa to the Havannah p
"- - that
that; when the (hip, was loll, only five-men perish-
ed in the ocean 5. the.rest having saved their live*
i^,the boat, were now landed on the main cptitLV
nerjt.... And what do they intend to do there? said
I. He replied, they have concerted measures to
escape, by building a vessel* but that they had nei-r
ther tools, nor provisions, so that all their designs
came to nothing* Supposing (said 1) I mould make
a,proposal, and invite them here, would they not,
canvy me prisoner to New Spain F He answered,,
No/: for he knew them to be such honest men, as?
would scorn to act: such inhuman baseness to their
deliverer: That if I pleased, he and the old sa>.
vagewcmld go over tp them, talk with them a-*
'' tout itT and buing me an answer; That they should
. all swear fidelity to me as their leader, upon the
holy sacrament: andt%r his part, he would not.
only dp the fame, but standby me to the last drop
of his blood, sliould there be occasion.
These solemn assurances made me resolve to*
grant them reliefs and to send these two over for
that purpose: but when every thing was ready, the
Spaniard raised am objection, which carried a greats
deal of weight in it: You-know, Sir, said,he,, tb*tt
having been same time with you* I cannot but b^
sensible of your flock of rice and com, sufficient
perhaps, for us at present, but mt for them, Jhoutd,
they come over presently; much less toviftualfy
vessel for an intended voyage. Want might he as
great an occasion for them to disagree and rebels
as the. children of Israel, did against God himself4
nphen they wanted bread in the wilderness, ^nd^
therefore, my advice is to wait another harvest, an$
in the mean time cultivate and improve fpme more\
land, whereby we may have plenty of provisions^ *
//; order to execute our design. ,
This advice of the Spaniard*s I approved ck-i
tremely 5 and so satisfies was I of his fidelity, that>
I esteemed
f esteemed him ever after. And thus wi a|l*four
went to work upon some more land, arid agdinft
seed-time we had gotten so much cured and Jtriitf-'
meet up, sufficient to sow 22 bushels of barley on,;
and 16 jars of rice, which was in short all the feed
we had to spare. .  *
As we were four in number, and "'by this time-
all in good health, we feared not a hilhdred In-
dians, should they Venture to attack us ; and while
the corn was growing, I pitched upon some trees,
fi^ to build us'a large vessels in cafe the Spaniards'
came over; which being marked, I ordered Fri-
day and his father to cut them down, appointing;
the Spaniard% who was now my privy counsellor,,
to oversee and direct the work. I likewise in-
creased my flocks of goats, by shooting the wild
dams, and bringing home their kids tcVmy inclo-
sure: nor did I neglect the grape-season, but ctP-
red them as usual,* though I had such a quantity^
now, as would have filled so barrels with railms*
And thus all 6f us being employed," they in work-"
ing, and I in proving for them, till harvest caiiie^
God Almighty I^lessed the increase of Ft so. trmch,,
tliat from twenty-two barrels of barley, we threfh-
edout two hundred and twenty, and the like quan-
tityNof rice, sufficient to victual a ship, fit to car-
ry me and all the Spaniards to any part of Airies
rica. * '"'..'
Thus the principal objection Being-answered'by*
a sufficient stock of pTovificm, I sent my two am-
bassadors over to the main-land, 'with a regal au-
thority* to administer the oaths of allegiance and"
fidelity, and have an instrument signed tinder their.
Bands, though I never asked whether they had'penr
ink ox paper; when giving each of them a- mus-
ket, eight charges of powder and ball, and provi-
sion enough for eight days, they failed away with?
a fair gale* on a day syhen the moon was at sulk-
Scarce
 
Scarce a fortnight had passed over roy head,
but,j impatient for their return, 1 laid me down'
to sleep one morning, when a strange accident
happened^ which was ushered in by my man's coming
running to uie, and calling aloud, Maflsr, maj-^
ten they are come, they are come* Upon which,'
not .dreaming of' any danger, out I jumped from,
my bedt ptyt. on my cloaihs, and hurried through,
my little grove; .when looking towards she lea, 1
perceived a host about a league and a half distant,
Handing in for the shore, with.the wind fair. I,
beheld they'did not come from the fide where the
land lay on, but from the southermost end of the
island',* ,'&> these being none of the people we want-
ed, ,i .ordered Friday to lie still, till such time as
J came dpwn from the mountain, which with my lad*
der;ltiow ascended, in order to discover more ful-
ly what they were; and now, with the help of
my perspective glass, I plainly perceived an Eng*
Jifnili|pf which I concluded it to be, by the fa--
Ihion of its longboat; and which filled me with
such, uncommon transports of joy, that 1 cannot
tell hipw to 'describe; and yet some secret doubts*
hung* about. me, proceeding from 1 know not what
causey as though I had reason to be upon my guard,,
Andlpdeed; I would have no man contemn the fe-
cref'hints^ and intimations of danger, which very.
oft (in'1 ire given, when he may imagine there is no
possibility of its being real; had not 1 been warn*
ed by this silent admonition, 1 had been in a worse,
situation! than before, and perhaps inevitably ruin-,
ed.: ""{ .' 9 -: ,
Nat .long, it was,, before I perceived the boat t.q
approach the shore, as though they looked for a
.place where they mightco#v tillep.tl^ Japd,; and at
last they ran their boat on shore upon the beach,,
about half a mile's distance; which proved so much
the happier for nip, since, had they come into the
creek,
creek, they had landed just at my door, and mjghs
not only have forced me out of my castle, but
plundered me of all I had in the world. Now I
was fully convinced they were all Englishmen,"
three of which were unarmed and bound; when
immediately the first four or five leapt on shore
-and took those three out of the boat as prisoners;
onfe of whom I could perceive used the most pas-
sionate gestures pflntreaty, affliction, and despair,
while the others, in a lesser degree, shewed abun-
dance of concern.
Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very
much astonished, and I beckoned to Friday, wha
was below, to ascend the mountain, and likewise
vievy this light. 0 Master, fays he to me, yousee
English mans eat prisoners as -well as Sava*ge rnans* 8
And do you think they will eat them, Fridays
said I, Yes, slid Friday, they eat a all up: No,,ho,
said I, Friday^ I am much more concerned lest
v they murder them; bnt as for eating them up,
that I am sure they will never do.~
And riow I not only lamented my misfortune,,
in not having the Spaniard and Savage with me^
But also that 1 could not come within lhat of them
unperceived, (they having no fire arms among
them,) and save these three men, whom I thought
they were going to kill with their swords. But
some comfort it was to me, that I perceived they*
were set at liberty to go where they pleased, the
rascally seamen scattering about as though they'
had a mind to fee the place: and so long didnthey
negligently ramble, that the tide had ebbed so low,
as to leave the boat aground. Nor were thid two
men that were in her more circumspect: for ha--
ving drunk a little too much liquor, they fell fast
asleep; but one of them waking before®the other,
and perceiving the hoat too fast a-ground for his-
strength tQ move it^ he hallooed out[t6 the rest^
< •*'•- who
who made all possible expedition to come to him:
but, as Providence ordered it, all their force was
ineffectual to launch her, when I could heat; them .
speak to one another, Why, let her alone; Jack,
can't ye, fie'll float next tide i by which words I
was fully convinced they were my own country-
men. All this while I lay very quiet, as being
fully sensible it could be no less than ten hours
before the boat would be afloat, and then it would
be so dark, as that they could not easily perceive
me, by which means I should be at more liberty to
hear their talk, and observe all their motiuns: not
but that I prepared for my defence: yet as I had
now another fort of enemies to cdtnbat with, I
acted with more caution. I took two fusees on
my shoulders, and gave Friday three muskets;
besides, my" formidable goat-skin coat, and mon- v
slrous cap, made me look as fierce and terrible
as Hercules of * old, especially when two pistols
were stuck in my belt, and my naked sword hang-
ing by my side.
-' It was my design at first not to make any at-
tempt till it was dark, but it being now two oV %
clock, in the very heat of the day, the sailors
wei*e all straggling into the woods, and undoubt-
edly were lain down to steep. The three poor
distressed creatures, too anxious to get any re-
pose, were, however, seated under the shade of *
a great tree, aboutf a quarter of a mile from me.
Upon which, without any more ado, I approach- •
ed towards them, with my man following behind
me, and, before I was perceived, I called aloud
to them in Spanish, What are ye, Gentlemen?
At these words they started up in great confusion,
when they beheld the strange figure I made, they
returned not answer, but seemed as, if they would
fly from me; Gentleman, (said fin EhglifJ?,) don't

-between you and these brutes since your landing, on-

Am I talking with God ^r man?.said' he, in
melting tears. Are you of .human kind,5 or an an-
tgei? Sir, said I, my poor habit may tell you I am
a man, and ass Englishman, willing to ajfist you,
having but this servant only: here are arms and
ammunition: tell freely your condition, can we
save you? The story, said he, is too long to re-
bate, since our butchers are so near: but, Sir, I
was master of that mlp,: my men have mutinied,
and it is a favour they have put my mate, this
passenger and me, on shore, without murdering
us, though we exjjefr nothing but perishing here.
Are your enemies goneP said L No, replied he,
(pointing to a thicket,) there they lye, while my
-heart trembles, lt!st, having seen and heard us,
•they should murder us all. Have they fire-armsf
'said J. -They have but two pieces, said he, ode
-of which is left in the boat He also told me,
there were two enormous villains among them,
•that were the authors "of this mutiny, who, if
they were killed or seized^ might induce the rest
to return, to their obedience. Well, well, said I,
let us retire farther tinder the covering of the
woodsy and there it was I made these conditions
with him:
I. That white they staid in the island, they
/should not pretend to any authority; but mould
entirely conform to my orders, and return to me
• the arms which I mould put into their hands.
II. That if the ship was recovered, they should
afford Friday and myself our passage gratis to
England. . When
When he had given me all the satisfaction I could
desire, I gave him and his two1 companions each
of them a gun, with powder and ball sufficient,
advising them to sire upon them as they lay sleep-
ing. The captain modestly said, that he was sor-
ry to kill them; though, on the other hand, to let
these villains escape, who were the authors of his
misery, might be the ruin of us all. Well, said
he, do as you thirit^fit: and so accordingly I fi-
red, killing one of, trie captain's chiefest enemies,
and wounding the other, who eagerly called for
assistance; but the captain (who had reserved his
piece) coming up to him, Sirrah, said he, rtis tod
late to call sot assistance, you Jhould rather cry t&
God to pardon your villainy; and so knocked him
down with the stock of his gun: three others were
also slightly wounded, who at my approach cried
out for mercy. This the captain granted, upot*
condition that they would swear to be true to'him*
in recovering the sliip, which they solemnly did:
however, I obliged the captain to keep them bound.
After which I sent Friday and the captain's mate
to secure the boat, and.bring away the oars and
fails; when, at their return, three men coming
hack, and seeing their late distressed captain now
their conqueror, submitted to J^e bound also. And
then it was, that having more liberty, I related
the adventures of my whole life, which he heard
with a serious and wonderful attention. After
this I carried him'^nd his two companions into my
little fortified castle, sliewed them all my conve-
niences, and refreslied them with such provisions
as I could afford. When this was over, we be-
gan to consider about regaining the ship: he said,
that there -were twenty-six hands on board, who
knowing their lives were forfeited by the law, for
conspiracy and mutiny, were so very hardened,
that- it would be dangerous for.our small company *
P to
to attack them. This was a reasonable: inference
indeed; but something we must resolve oh, and
immediately put in execution s we therefore hea-
ved the boat upon the beach so high, that she could
not shoot off at high water mark, and broke a
hole in her not easily to be stopped; so that all
the signals they gave for'the boat to come on board
were jji vain. This obliged tirem to send another
boat ashore, with ten men armed, whose faces the \
captain plainly descried, the boatswain being the
chief officer.; but he said there were three honest
lads among them, who were forced, into the ^con-
spiracy. Hereupon 1 gave him fresh courage, (for
I had perceived he was in concern;) in the mean ,
while securing our prisoners, except two, whom
we took to our assistance, we thought ourselves
able enough to adventurjs a battle. When the
fVilqrs landed, and beheld their boat in that con-
dition, they not only halooed* but fired for their
companions to hear, yet they received no answer.
This struck them wkh horror and, amazement,
thinking their companions were murdered, they"
made as if ihey would return to the ship. I could
perceiye the captain's Countenance change at this,
till of a sudden three men were ordered to look
aster the boat, while the other seven leapt on shore,
in order-to searph for their companions: and in-
deed they came to the brow of the hill, near my
aucient castle, from whence they could fee to a
-great distance in the woqds, and there {houting
arid hallooing till tired and weary, they at lengths
seated themselves under a spreading tree. My o-
pinion was, that nothing cotild bti done till night,
"when I might use some artifice to get them all out
of the boat; but of a sudden they started up, and
made to the sea-side; hereupon I ordered Friday
aud the captain's mate to go over the creek, and
halloo as loud4as they could? and so .decoying them,
4 into
Into the woods, come- round to me again. And
this indeed had a good effect; f®r they followed
the noise, till coming westward to the creek, they
called for their boat to carry them over, and tak-
ing oneof the men out of her, left two to look
after her, having fastened her to the stump of a
little tree on more. Hereupon . immediately the
captain and our party passing the creek, out of
their flight, we surprised them both, by the cap>
tain's knocking down one, and ordering the other
to surrender upon pain of death, and who, being
the honestest of them all, sincerely joined with us#
By this time it was pretty late j when the rest re*
turning to their boar, which they found aground
in the creek, the tide out, and the men gone, they
ran about wringing their hands, crying it was aa
Indian ted island, and that they should be all mur-
dered by spirits or devils. My men would willingly
have fallen upon them, but I would not agree to
hazard any of our party. But to be more cer~
tain, Friday and the captain crawled upon their
hands and feet as near as possible; arid when the
boatswain approached in light, so eager was the*
captain, that he fired, and killed him on the spot*
Friday wounded the next man, arid a third ran a-
'way. Hereupon I advanced with my whole armyy
and it being dark, I ordered the men we had sur-
prised with the boat, to call them by their names,,
and to parley with them. Accordingly he called
out albttd, Tom Smiths 7om Smith? He answered,
Who's that P Robinson, answered the other, for
God's fake ^ Tom, surrender immediately^ or you're
all dead men. V^ho must we surrender to, says
Smith. To our captain and fifty men here, who*
have iaken me prisoner, wounded Will Fry es, and
killed the boaijwuin. Shall we have quarters then?"
said^ he. Hereupon the captain calls out, Your
Smith, you know my voice, surrender immediaielyr
P 2 and
and you shall alt have your lives granted except
Will Atkins. Hereupon dtkins cries out, What
have I done\ Captain^ more th'an the reft, who have
keen as bad as me P but that was a lie, for he was
the person that laid hold of bin*, and bound hirru
However* he was ordered to submit to the go-
vernor's mercy, for such was I called. And so
laying down their arms, we bound them all, and
seized on tjieir boat.
After this, the captain expostulated with them*
telling them, that the governor was an English"
man, who might execute them there; but he
thought they would be sent to England* except
Will Atkins, who was ordered to prepare for
death next morning. Hereupon Atkins implored
the captain to intercede for his life, and the rest beg-
ged that they might not be sent to England. This an-
swer ed our projectsor seizing the snip. For after send-
ing Atkins, and two of the worst* fast bound to the
cave, and the rest being committed to my bower, I
lent the captainto treat with them in the governor's
name, offering them pardon if they would assist in
recovering theihip. Upon which they all promised to
standby him till the lastdropof theirblood; and whom-
ever acted treacherously, mould be hangedin chains
upon the beach." They were all released on these
assurances; and then the captain repaired the other
boat, making his passenger captain of her, and
gave him four men well armed; while himself, his
mate, and five more, went in* the other hoat. By
midoight they came within call of the ship, when
the captain ordered Robinson to hail her, and tell
them, that with great difficulty they had found the
menatlaste But while they were discoursing, the
captain, his mate, and the rest entered, and knock-
ed down the second mate and carpenter, secured
those that were upon the deck, by putting them
uadex hatches, while the other boat's crew enter-
ed
fcd and secured the foreca'stle; they then broke in-
to the round-house, where the mate, after some re-
sistance, shot the pirate captain through the head;
upon which all the rest yielded themselves prison'*
ers. And thus the ship being recovered, the joy-
ful signal was fired, which I heard with the great-
est joy imaginable: nqr was it longbeforehebrought
the ship to an anchor at the creek's mouth, where*,
coming to me unawares, There, fays he, my deaf-
*st friend and deliver er^ there isyourJiipi tind we
are your servants; a comfort so unspeakable, as
made me swoon in his arms, -vyhiie, with gratitude
to Heaven, we were tenderly embracing each o-
tlietv
Nothing iiow remained, but to consult whiat we
fliqifld ^do with the prisoners, whom he thought it
was not safe to take on board. Hereupon, con-
certing v/ith the captain, I dressed myself in on&
of his suits, and fending for them, told them, that
as. I was going to leave the island with all my peo-
ple, if they would tarry there, their lives should
be spared; if not,, they should be hanged at the first
port they cam>,at* They agreed to stay* Here*
upon I told them my whole story, charging them
to be kind to the Spaniards that Were expected^
gave them a limy arms, and informing them of e"-
yery thing necessary for their subsistence, I an9
t my man Friday went on board. But the next
morning two of the men came swimming to the »
ship's fide, desiring rne captain to take ihim oft
board, though he hanged them afterwards, cbirf-
plaining mightily how barbarously the others used
them. Upon which I prevailed With thecaptdm
• to take them in, 'and being severely whipt and
•pickled, they proved more honest for'the future.
And so I bidfarewel tothis island, carrying alqirg

ter twerity-eight years, two months, and nineteen
days residence, that fame day and month that I es-
caped from Sallee, landing in England^ June u
1687, aster five and thirty years absence from
my own country, which rendered me altogether
a stranger there.
# Here I found my first captain's widow alive,
who had buried a second husband, but in very
mean circumstances, and whom I made mighty ear
fy upon my account. Soon after I went down to
Yorkshire, where all my family were expired, ex-
cept two sisters, and as many of one of my bro^
ther's children. I found no provision had been
made for me, they concluded I had been long since
dead; so that I was but in a very ^slender station*'
Indeed the captain did me £ great kindness, by his
jeport to the owners, how I had delivered their
ship on the desolate island* upon which they made
me a present of 2001. Sterling., I next went to
Lisbon, taking my man Friday with, me, and there
arriving in April, I met the Portuguese captain,
-who had taken me on board on the African coast;
but being ancient, he had left off the sea, and rea-
ligned all his business'to his sonr who followed
the Erazil trade. So altered both of us were, that
we did not know each other at first* till I disco*
ver ed myself more fully to him.' After a few em*-
braces, I began to inquire of jny concerns^ and
.then the old gentleman told me, that it was nine
years since he had been at Brazil, where my part-
ner was then living, but my trustees were* both
dead; that he believed I should have a good account
of the prbduct of my plantation; that the imagine
tion of my being lost had obliged my trustees to give
an estimate of my share to the procurator-fiscal,
who, in caseof niy not returning, he had given one
thrrdf^the JKing, and the rest to the monastery oi^
St. Augufjtine; b&tif Iputinmy claim;.or any onefor
me, it woutdbe returned, except the yearly products
•which was given to the poor. I then desired him to tell
me what impr6vement he thought had been made of
my plantation, and whether he imagined it was
worth my while to look after it? He answered,
he did not know how mugh it was improved; but
„this he was certain of, that my partner was growti
vastly rich upon his half of it; and that he had
been informed, that the king had 200 moidores
per annum for his third part. He added, that the
survivors of my trustees were persons of an inge-
nuous character; that my partner could witness
my' title, my naine being registered in the country,
by which means I mould indisputably recover, a
considerable sum of money. . But, answered I, how
could my trustees^ dispose of my effects, when I
made you only my heir? This he said was true;
but thsir being no affidavit made of my death, he
could not act as my executor. However, he had
ordered his son (then at Brasil) to act by procu~
ration upon my account, and he had taken posses-
sion of my sugar-house, having accounted himself
for eight years with my partner and trustees for
"the profits, of which he would give me a very
good account. - \, ..
And indeed this he performed very faithfully in
a few days, making himself indebted to me 470
moidores of gold, over and above what had been
lost at sea, after I had left * the place. And then
he recounted to me what misfortunes he had gone
through, which forced my money out of his hands,
to buy part in a new ship: but, fays he, you Jhali
not want, take this, and when my fin returns, eve*
ry farthing shall be said you. Upon which he put
into my hand a purse of 150 moidores in gold^ as
likewise the instrument containing the title to the
ship which his son was in, and which he offered as
security for the remainder. But really when I
* saw

England; wjien, as it happened, I got a ydung%
English gentleman, a merchant's son at Lisbon, to
accompany me, together with two English, and
two Portuguese gentlemen} so that with a Portu-
guese servant, an English sailor, and my man Fri-
day, there were nine of us in number.
Thus armed and equipped, we set out, and
came to Madrid, when the summer decaying, we
liasted to Navarre; where we were informed, that
there was scarcely any passing, by reason of thepro-
digious quantity of snow; so^that we were obliged to
&bide hear twenty days at Pampeluna, and at last to
take a guide to conduct us safe towards Tholouse.
And now twelve other gentlemen joining with us^
together with their servants, we had a very jolly
company. Away our guide led us by the fright-
ful mountains, and through so many intricate
mazes and windings, that we insensibly passed them,
which, as we travelled along, ushered us into the
Erospect of the fruitful and charming provinces-of
ianguedoc and Gascogne.
But now came on two adventures, both tragi-
cal and comical., First, our guide was encounter-
ed by three wolves and a bear, who set upon him
and his horse, and wounded him in three pla-..
ces: upon which my man riding up to his assist-
ance, shot one of them dead upon the spot, which
made the others retire to the woods But tjh&
pleasantest adventure was, to behold my man at-
tack the bear. 'Tis such a creature, that if you1
let him alone, he will never meddle with you: and
this my man very well knew, and so begging leave
of me in broken "Englissi, he told us he would make
good laugh. Why, you silly fool, said I he'll eat
you up at a mouthful. Eatee me up, replied he,
by way of scorn, me not onty eatee him, hut make
much good laugh. Upon which, pulling off his boots^
be ckps on his pumps> and running after the mon-
strous
»strous beast, he called out, that he Wanted to dis-
course with him, and then throwing stones on purr
pose to incense him, the beast turns about in afury^
and with prodigious strides shuffles after him* But
though he was nor swift enough to keep up. pace
with Friday, who made up to us as it were for
help, yet being angry, You dvg, said I, immediate*
ly take horse, and let as shoot the creature. But
he cried, Dear Master, nostoot, me make you laugb
much. And so he turned about making signs to
follow, while the bear ran after hirii, till coming
to a ^reat oak, he ascended in a minute,•. leaVittg
his gun at the bottom of it. Nor did the bear
make any difficulty of it, but ascended like a cat*,
though his weight was Very great. You must con-
sider I was not a little amazed at the folly of my
tttan, as not perceiving any thing to occasion our
laughter, till such time as we rode upnearer, and
beheld the beast riiounted upon the oak, on the be-
ginning of the fame branch, to which Friday clung
at the farther end, where the bear durst riot come.
Hereupon Friday cried.out, Now master, me niakt
much laughy me make de bear dance. Upon which
he fell a-sliaking the bough, which made the crea-
ture look behind him, to.fee how he could retreat*
Then, as if the bear had understood his stammer-
ing English: Why you no come farther, Mr Bear^
said he, pray j Mr Bear, come farther: and then
iirdeed we ail burst into laughter, especially when
we perreived Friday dro#p like a squirrel upon the
grounds leaving the oeast to make' t;he best of his
way down the tree. Arid now thinking it the
most convenient time to {hoot the creature, Friday
cried out j 0 dear master, no Jlioot, me stooot hy and
by; when taking up the gun, Me no shoot yet, laid
he, me make once more much laugh. And accord-
ingly he was as good as his word;, for the creature
descending backwards from the tree very leisure-
ly; .before-he cpuld lay one foot on the grounds
Friday (list him through the ear, stone dead: and
looking to fee whether we were pleased, he burst
out into a hearty laughter, saying, So w kill dc
bear in yny country', not with the gun but with much .
long arrows* Thus ended our diversion, to our
great satisfaction; especially in' a place where the
terrible bowlings struck us \yith a continual ter-
ror. But the ihows now growing Very deep, par-
ticularly qn the mountains, the ravenous creatures
wer©~obliged to leek for sustenance in the villages,
where, coming by surprise on the country people,
they killed several of them* besides a great num.
ber of tlieir slieep and^ horses.
* Our guide tgld us, Ve had yet one more danger-
ous place to pass by; and if there were any more
wolves in the country, there we should find them.
This was a small .plain* encompassed with woods,
to get through a long lane, to the village where*
we were to lodge. When we entered the wood,
the fun was within half an hour of setting; and a
little after it was* set, we came into the plain,"
which was riot above two furlongs over, and then'
we perceived five great wolves crose the road,
without taking notice of Us, and so swift as though
they were pursuing after jheir prey. Hereupon-
our guide believing there were more coming, de-
sired us to be upon oiir guard. Accordingly our
eyes were very circumspect:, till about half a league
farther, we perceived a d^d horse and near a do^en
of wolves devouring i?s carcase, lyly manlTridajr
fain would have fired at them, but I would not
permit him; nor had wi gone half oyer ithe plain,
but we heard dreadful frowlings in a wood on put
left* when presently we j*awv an hundred tconte up
against ufc, as though they had beeti an .experien-
ced arnty. This (©bilged M to form ourselves in
thebectmanner; aiiuithen I cgrcieiWt&a|.gyery other
: - man
man should fire, that those who did not might
be ready to give a second volley should they ad-
vance upon us and then, every jnan should make
use of his pistols. But there was no necessity for
• this;'for the enemy being terrified, stopped at the
noise of the fire; four of them were shot dead, and
several others being wounded, went bleeding a«<
tvay, as we could very plainly discover by the
snow. And now remembring what had been often
told me, that such was the majesty of man's voice,
as to strike terror even into the fiercest creatures,
I ordered all our companions to halloo as loud as
possible; and in this notion I was not altogether
mistaken, for they immediately turned about upon
the first halloo, and began to retire; upon which
ordering a second volley in their rear, they galloped
into the woods with great precipitation.
Thus we had some small time to load our pieces
again, and then made all the haste we cousd on
our wTay; but we had not rode far, before we
were obliged to put ourselves in a posture of de-
fence as before,* being alarmed with a very dread-
ful noise in the fame wood, on xmr left hand, the
fame way as we were to pass, only that it was at
some distance from us. By this time the darksome
clouds began to spread over the elements, and the
night growing very dusley, made it so much the
more to our disadvantage; but still the noise in-
creasing, we were fully assured, that it was the
howling and yelling of those ravenous creatures 5
when presently three troops of wolves, on our
front, appeared to our sight, as though a great
number of them had a design to surround us and
devour us in spite of sate. But as they did not
fall upon us immediately, we proceeded on our
journey in as swift a manner as the roads would
permit our horses, which was only a large trot.
It was in this manner we travelled^ tilKsuch time
, - < •- . '' a?
as we discovered another wood, and had the pros-
pect of its entrance' through which we were to;
pass, at the farthest fide of the plain. But surely
none can express the terror we were in, whea,
approaching the lane, we perceived a confused
number of the fiercest wolves standing, and as it
were guarding its entrance. Nor were we long
in this amazement, before/another occasion of hor-
ror presented itself; for suddenly we heard the re-
port of a,gun at another opening into the wood,
aikl looking that way, out ran a horse bridled and
saddled, flying with the greatest swiftness, and no
less than sixteen or seventeen wolves pursuing af-
ter hint, in order to devour the poor creature;
arid unquestionably they did so, after they had run
him down, not being able" to hold out that swift-
-ness with which he at first escaped~them.
When we rode up to thaf entrance from whence
the horse came- forth, there lay the carcases of ai>
other horse and two men, mangled and torn by
these devouring wolves: and undoubtedly one of
these men was the person who fired the gun whfch
we had heard, for the piece lay by him; but alas!.
most of the upper part of his body and }iis head
were entombed in the bowels of these ravenous
-creatures.
What course to take, whether to proceed or re-
treat, we could not tell; but it was not long be-
fore the wolves themselves made us come to a re-
solution: for such numbers surrounded us, every
one of whom expected their prey, that, were our
hodies to be divided among them, there would not
be. half a mouthful a-p'iece." But happy, very hap-
py it was for us that but a Jittle way from the en-
trance, there lay iome very, large timber trees*
which t supposed had been cut down and laid there
for sale; amongst which I drew my little troop,
placing ourselves hi^ixiine behind'one long tred,
Q which
which served us for a breast-work, when desiring
them to alight, we stood in a triangle, or three
fronts, inclosing our horses injhe centre, the on*
ly place where we could preserve them.
Never certainly was there a more furious charge
than what the wolves made upon us in this place?
and the light of the horses, which was the princi-
pal thing they aimed at, provoked their hunger,
and added to their natural fierceness. They came
on us with a dreadful noise, that made the woods
to ring again; and beginning to mount the pieces
of timber, I ordered every other man to fire as be-
fore directed, and indeed so well did they take their,
aim, that they killed several of the wolves at the
first volley; but still we were obliged to keep a con-
tinual firing, by reason they came on like devils,
pushing one another with the greatest fury. But,
our second volley something abated their courage,
when stopping a little, we hoped they would have
made the best of their way; however} it did not
prove so, for others made a new attempt upon us:
and though in four firings we killed seventeen or
. eighteen of them, laming twice as many, yet they
several, times successively came on, as though they
valued n ot ^ their lives for the fake of their prey.
Unwillingly was I to spend our last shot too sud-
denly, and therefore called my other servant, and
giving him a horn of powder, bid him lay a large
train quite along the timber, which he did, while
Friday was charging my fusee and his own, with
the greatest dexterity. By thisrtime the wolves
coming up the timber, I let sire to the train, by
snapping a discharjged pistol close on the powdeiV
This so scorched and terrified them, that some fell
down, arid others jumped* in among us; but these
we immediately dispatched, when all the rest frigh-
ted witls the light, which the darksome night 'cau-
sed to appear more dreadful, began at length to re-
tirej
vj
tire; upon which, ordering our last pistols to be
- fired at once^ giving at the fame time, a great
shout, the wolves were obliged to have recourse
to their swiftness, and turn tail; and then we sal-
lied out upon twenty lame ones, cutting them in
pieces with our swords, which obliged them to
howl lamentably, to the terror of their fellows*
who resigned to us the field as victorious conquer-
ors. And indeed I question whether Alexander
king of'Macedonia, in any of his conquests, had
more occasion for triumph than we had; for he was
but attacked by numerous armies of soldiers;
whereas our little army was obliged to combat a
legion of devils, as it were, worse than the canni-
basl, who, the samemoment, had they (lain us would
have sacrificed us, to satisfy their voracious appe-
tites. 
Thus ended our bloody battle with the" beasts, ha-
ving killed threescore of them, and saved our lives
from their fury.. We still had a league farther to go,
when, as we went, ours ears were ialutde with their
most"unwelcome howlings, and we expected every
moment another attack. But in an hour's time
we arrived at the town where we were to lodge;
and here we found the place strictly guarded, and
all in terrible confusion, as well they might, for
fear of the bears and wolves breaking into the
.village, in order to prey upon their cattle and
people; The next morning we were obliged to
take a new guide, by reason the other fell very-
bad of hjs wounds, which he had received, as be-
fore mentioned; After he had reached Thoutoufe,
we came into a warm, pleasant, and fruitful coun-
try, not infested with wolves, or any fort of ra-
venous creatures: and when we told our story
there/they much blamed our guide, for conducting
us through the forest at the foot of the mountain^
in such a severe season, wlien the snow obliged the

wolves to, seek fpr shelter in the \voads, When
we informed them in what manner we placed cntr-
ielves, and the horses in the centre, they exceed-
ingly reprehended us, and told us, it was an hun-
dred to one, but we had all been destroyed; for
that it was the very .fight of the .horses* their lo
much desired prey, that"made the wolves more
xagingly furious than they would have been, which
was evident, by,their being at other times really *
afraid of a gtfn; but then being exceeding -hungry
ynd furious, upon that account, their eagerness to
come at the" horses made tt}em insensible of their
danger; and that if we^hadjriQt by a continual
fire, and at last by. the cunning stratagem of tlie
train of powderr got the .better of them, it ha|d
been great odds if their number had not over-
powered us ; besides, itwas a great mercy we alight-
ed frqm,. our horses, and fought them with that
courage and conduct, which, had we failed to do,
every man of us, with our. beasts, had been de-
voured: and, iiv3ee;d,this„ was nothing but truths
for never in my life wa$ I so sensible of danger,
^as,when,three hundred devils„came roaring upon
vis, to^fhuii whose unwelcome company, if I was
sure to meet a storm-every week, 1 wquW rather

from thence to Calais, where I took shipping, and
landed at Dover the 14th of January, in a very
cold season, ,

discovered my new found estate, and all the bills

The good, ancient widow, my .only privy counsel-
lor,
lor, thought no pains nor care great enough to\
procure my advantage ; nor had I ever occasion to
blame her fidelity, which drew from me an ample
reward. I was for leaving my effects in her hands*
intending to set out for Liibon, and so to the Bra-
"fils ; but as in the Desolate IJland I had some doubts
about the Romish religion, so I knew there was
little encouragement to settle there, unless I would
apostatize from the orthodox faith, or live in con-'
tirmal.fear of the inquisition". Upon this account
I resolved to fell my plantation; and for that in-
tent I wrote to my old friend at Liibon, who re-
turned me an answer to iny great satisfaction;
\vhich was, that be could fell it to good account:
however, ,if I thought it convenient to give him
"liberty to offer it in my name to the two merchants,
the survivors of my trustees, residing at the Bra*-
fils, who consequently understood its intrinsic va-
lue,* having lived just uporr the spot, and who I
was sensible were very rich, and therefore might'
be the more willing to purchase it 4 he did not in
the least doubt, but that I mould make four or
five thousand pieces of eight more of it, than I
could do, if I disposed of it in any other manner
whatsoever. «
You may Be sure I could 'riot but agree witlithfs
kind, and ingenious proposal 5 and immediately I
sent him an order to offer it to them, which he- ac-
cordingly did j so that, about eight ^months after,
the ship being in that time returned, he gave me a
satisfactory account, that they not only willingly
accepted the offer, but that they had also remitted
33,000 pieces of eight to a correspondent of their
own at Lisbon, in order to pay for the purchase.
Hereupon in return I signed the instrument of
sale according to form, which they^ had sent from
.Lisbon, and returned it again to my old friend,
he having sent me for my estate, bills of three
O o hundred
hundred twenty-eight thousand pieces qf eight, re*
serving the payment of on? hundred tnoidores per
annum, which I had allowed him during life, like-
wise fifty to his son during his life also, according
to my faithful promise, which the plantation was
to make good as a rent, charge.^
And thus having led my reader to the know-
ledge of the first part of my life,'so remarkable
for the many peculiar providences that attended
it, floating in an ocean of uncertainty and disap-
pointment, of adversity and prosperity, beginning
foolishly, ^nd yet ended happily, methinks now that
I am come to a safe and pleasant haven, it is time
to cast out my anchor, and laying up my vessels
bid for a while adieu to foreign adventures. I
had no other concerns to look after, but the ear p
of my brother's two sons, which, with the good-
widow's persuasions, obliged me to continue at
home seven years. One of these children I bred
lip a gentleman, and the other an experienced
sailor, remarkable for his courage and bravery.
Besides this, I married a virtuous young gentle-
woman, of a Tery good family, by whom I had
two sons and one daughter. But my dear, and ten-
der wife leaving this earthly stage, (as in the se-
cond part of my life you will hear,) which rent
my soul as it were asunder, my native country
Became weary and tiresome to me: and my ne-
phew happening to come from the sea, tempted
me .to venture another voyage to the East Indies,
which I did in the year 1694, at which time I vi-
sited my island, and informed myself of every thing
that happened since my departure.
. One might reasonably imagine, that what I had
suffered, together with ait advanced age, and the
fear of losing, not only what I had gotten, but my
life also, might have choked' up all the seeds qf
youthful ambition and curiosity, and put a lasting
period

. thing but death can fully allay the active part of
my life, no less remarkable for the many various
contingencies of it; you will next perceive bow
I visited my little kingdom, saw my successors the
Spaniards, had -an account of the usage they met
with from the Englishmen, agreeing and disagree-
ing, uniting and separating, till at last they were
subjected to the Spaniards, who yet ilsed them very
honourably, together with the wonderful and sucr
cessful tattles over the Indians, who invaded, and
thought to have conquered the island, but were
repelled by their invincible courage and bravery,,
having taken eleven men and five women prison-
ers, by which at my return I found about twenty
young thildren on my little kingdom. Here I
.staid twenty days, left them supplies of a)l neces-
sary things, as also a carpenter and smith, and
sharing the island into parts, reserving the whole
.property to myself. Nor will yon be insensible,,
by the account otthesq things, of several new ad-,
ventures I have been engaged in, the battles I have.
fought, the deliverances I have met with: and
while, in the surprising relation of such remark-
able occurrences, I slialI describe many of God's
kindest providences to me in particular, no less
conspicuous in the fame goodness, power and ma*
jesty of. our great Creator, shewn, one way or
other, over the face of the earth, if duly advert-
ed to.

WHEN we consider the puissant force of Na-
ture, and what mighty influence it ha$
many times over the temper of the mind, it will
be no such great wonder to t'hink, that my power-
ful reason should be overcome by a much stronger
inclination. My late acquired kingdom ran con-
tin uaiiy in my thoughts aH the day, and I dream-
ed of it in the night; nay, I made it the continual
, subject of my talk, even to impertinence^ when I
was awake. I had such vapours in my head, that
I actually supposed myself at my* castle; that I not
only perceived Friday's father, but the old Spa-*
niard, and the wicked sailors, but that I talked aud
discoursed with thern about their manner of li-
ving; that I heard these things related to me,
which T found afterwards to be but too true: and
that I executed my judgments with the greatestfeve-
rity'upon the offenders. And indeed, this antici-
pating all the .pleasing joys of my life, scarcely af-
forded me one pleasant hour: my dear-and tender
wife could not but take notice of it, which drew
these affectionate speeches from her: My dear,
said Jhe, / am realty persuaded that some secret im-
pulse from heaven occasions in you a deteHninatidn
to fee the island again: nor am I less sensible, but
your being engaged to me, and theft dear chiidrenr
is the only hindrance of your departure. I knowr
my dear, if I was in the grave, you would not.
long continue at home ; prevent not your happiness
upon my account, whose only comfort centers in you."
All that I can object is, that such an hazardous un-<
dertaking is no way consistent with a person of your
years $
years; but if you are resolved; to go% added ,flie,
weeping, only pennitme to bear you corns any, and
that is all that I desire. Suchs endearing tender-
ness, graced with the most innocent, and yet moil
powerful charms,, brought me inseqsiblyinto my
right understanding; and when I considered all
the transactions of my life,, and particularly my
new engagement; that Lhad now one child alrea-
dy born, and my wife big of another 5 and that.I
had no occasion to, seek for rnpre riches, "who al-r
ready was blessed with,,sufficiency, with muqh
struggling I altered my"resolutions at last, resol-
ving to apply myself to sonie business or other,
whicbu might /put a period to such wandering incli-.
nations. Hereupon I bought a little farm in tjie
cp\mty gf Bedford, witl^a resolution to move thi-
ther: upon this there was a pretty convenient
house, surrounded with land, very capable of im-
provement, which suited my temperas to plant-
ing, managing, and cultivating. Nor was I, long
before I entered upon my new settlement, having
bought ploughs, harrows, carts, waggons, horses,
Sows, and-sbeep; so that I now led the life of a
country -gentleman, and as happy in my retire-
inent as t^e greatest monarch in the world. An4
what made me think my happiness the greater was,
that I was in that middle pate oflife, which my
father had so often recommended, much resembling
the felicity of a, rural retirement, which is elc-
* gantly described, by the poet in these lines:
Free from all vie el, free from care,
Ag$ has no pain% *and youth no snare*
.But, in the midst of this my happiness, I was sud-
denly plunged into the greatest sorrows that I
could possibly endure: for, when I least expected
it, my dear and tender wife was forced to submit
- to
to the irresistible power of death, leaving this
transitory lite fora better. It is impossible for
me to express the beauties of her mind, or the
loveliness of her person; neither can I too much
lament her loss, which-my latest breath shall re-
cord: her influence was greater over me than
the powers of my own reason, the importuni-
ties of friends, the instructions of a father, or the
melting tears of a tender and disconsolate mother:
in a word, ihe was the spirit of all my affairs, and
"thfc centre of my enterprises. But now, since the
cruel hand of deatfi had closed my dearest's eyesf
1 seemed in my thoughts a stranger to* the world;
my privy counsellor being gone, I was like a /hip
without a pilot,' that could only run before the
wind. And when I looked around me inlfhis busy
world, one part labouring for bread, and the other
squandering away their estates, this put me in
mind how 1 had lived in my little kingdom, where
both reason and religion dictated to me, that there
was something that certainly was the reason and
end of life, which was far superior to what could
be hoped far on this side the grave. IVIy coun-
try delights were now as insipid and dull, as mu-
sic or science to those who have neither taste nor
ingenuity.. In short, resolving to leave off house-
keeping, I left my farm, and in a few months re-
turned to London.
But neither could that great city, so famous for
its variety of entertainment, afford me any agree-
able delight: a state of idleness I found to be the
very dregs of life, and most hurtful to body and
foul. It was now the beginning of the year 1694,
at which time my nephew (who, as I before ob-
served,, had been brought up to the sea, and ad-
vanced to be captain of a sliip) was returned from
a short voyage to Bilboa, the first he had made in
that station. He comes .to me one morning, tel-
ling me, that some merchants of his acquaintance
had proposed to him to go a voyage for them," to
the East Indies and China, in the manner of pri-
vate traders: and now, uncle, said he, if you'll
accompany me thither, I'll engage to land you upon
your old island, to visit the slate of your little king-
dom.
Just before he came in, my thoughts were fixed
to get a patent for its possession,. and then to sill
it with inhabitants. After 1 had paused a littld'
while, and looked stedfastly on him, What devil,
or spirit, said I, sent you with this unlucky errand?
He started at first, but recovering himself, when
he perceived I was not offended, Sir, replied he,
what I have proposed cannot, I hope, be styled
unlucky, since certainly you must be desirous to
fee your little territory, where you reigned,with
more content than any of your brother-kings in
the universe. Nephew, said I, if you will leave
me there, and call for me as you come back, I
care not if I give my consent: but he answered,
that the merchants would not allow their vessel,
loaden with an,infinite value, to return there again,
which was a month's fail out of the way: besides,
Sir, said he, if I should miscarry, was your re-
quest granted, why then you would be locked up
as before. This indeed carried a great deal of
reason in it, but we found out a remedy, and that
was, to carry a framed sloop on board, ready to
be set up in the island, by the assistance of some
carpenters, which we should carry with us, that
might be fitted in a few days to go to sea. I was
not long in forming my resolution, which over-
swayed my good friend the widow's persuasions,
and the natural affection I bore to my young chil-
dren. I made my will, and settled my estate in
such a manner, that I was perfectly sure that my
poor infants would have justice done them. The
- '" "godd
good widow not only undertook to make provision
for my voyage, but also took the charge of my
domestic affairs, and to provide for my children's
education; and indeed no mother could take more
care, or understood that office better; for which
I lived to reward, and return her my hearty thanks.
The beginning of January 1694-5, my nephew
being ready to fail, I and Friday went on board
in the Downs on the 8th, having, beside that sloop
already mentioned, a very considerable cargo for
my new colony. Fit ft, I had some servants, whom
I proposed to leave there, as inhabitants, or to.
work while I staid there, as they mould appear
willing: there were two carpenters, a smith, and
a very ingenious fellow who was Jack of aUtrades;
for he was not'oply a cooper by trade, but also
he was dexterous at making'wheels and hand mills
to grind corn, likewise a good turner, and a good
pot-maker. I also carried a tayfor, who consent-
ed to stay in my plantation, and proved a most ne-
cessary fellow in the island. As to my cargo, jt
cdnsisted of a sufficient quantity of linen, and
English stuffs, for cloathing the Spaniards that I
expected to find there; as likewile gloves, hats,
slioes, stockings ; together with beds, bedding, and
household stuff, especially kitchen utensils, with
pots, kettles, pewter^ brase, &c. also nails, tools
of all sorts, staples, hooks, hinges, and all other
things necessary ; all which, I think,'cost me about
three hundred "pounds. Nor was this all; for I
carried an hundred spare-arms, muskets and fusees,
besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of
several sorts of mot, two brass cannon, besides
swords, cutlafles, and the iron part for some pikes
and halberts. I made my nephew take with us
two small quarter deck guns,- more than' he had
occasion for in his ship, to leave behind, if there
was a necessity $ that so we might build a fort
there,
there, and man it against all opposers whatsoever,
Well, we pat out to sea; and though I can't
say this voyage was so unprosperous as my others
had been, yet contrary winds drove us so far
northward, rhat we were obliged to put in at
Gal way in Ireland, where we lay wind-bound two
and twenty days. Here indeed* our provisions
were very cheap, and we added to our ship's stores,
by taking in several live hogs, two cows and calves,
which I then resolved to put on shore in my island,
if our necessities did not call for them. On the
^th of February we sailed from Ireland, with a
yery fair gaieT" which lasted for some days; and I
think it was about the 20th of the fame month,
late in the evening, when the mate informed us,
that he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired;
and when he was speaking, a boy came in, and told
us, that the boatswain had heard another. Upon
which we all ran to the quarter deck, from whence
in a few moments we perceived a terrible fire at
a distance. We had immediately recourse to our
reckonings, in which we were all of opinion, that
there could be no land that way, it appearing to
be at N. N. W. Hereupon we concluded that
some ship had taken fire at sea, and that it could
not be*far off, by the report of the guns which
we had heard. We made up diredly to it, and
in half an hour's time, the wind being fair, we
could plainly perceive a great ship on fire in the
middle of the sea. Touched with this unhappy
disaster, and considering my former circumstances,
when the Portuguese captain took me up, I imme-
diately ordered live guns to be fired, that the poor
creatures, not seeing us, it being dark, (though
we could perceive their flame,) might be sensible
there was deliverance at hand, and consequently
might endeavour to save themselves in their boat.
Nor was it long before the ship blew up in the
R air,
^if, arid the fire was extinguished in the ocean.
But supposing them all to be in their boats, we
hung out our lanterns, and kept firing till eight1
o'clock in the morning; when, with our perspec-
tives, we beheld two boats, full of people, making
towards us, though the tide was against them;
then spreading out our ancient, and hanging but
a waft, as a signal for them to come on board, in
half an hour's time, we came up to them, and took
them all in, there being no less than sixty-four
men, women and children; It was a French mer-
chant ship of 300 tons, homeward bound from
<3uebeqk in the river of Canada. The master in-
formed me how, by the negligence of the steers-
man, the. steerage was set on fire; that, at his
outcry fov help, the fire was, as they thought, to-
tally extinguimed; but that fame sparks getting:
between the timber, and within the ceiling, it
proceeded into thejiold, where there was no re-
listing it; that then they got into their boats, as
creatures in the last extremity, with what provi-
sion they had, together with oars, fails, and a
compass, Intending to go back to Newfoundland,
the wind blowing at S. E. and by E. though there
were several chances against them, as storms to
overset and founder them, rains and colds, to
benumb aud perish their limbs, and contrary winds
to keep,them.back and starve them: but, said he,
iti this our great distress, we heard the welcome
report of your guns, when, with unspeakable
jojr, taking, down our masts and fails, we were
resolved to lye by till morning; but perceiving
your light, we set our oars at work to keep our
* boat a-head, the sooner to attain your ship, the
happy instrument qf our deliverance.
Indeed.no one can express the joy of these poor
creatures on this occasion; fear and grief tare ea-
sily set forth .j sighs and tears, with.a few. motions.
of
of thie hands and head, are all the demonstrations
of these passions 5 but an excess of joy carries in
it a thousand extravagancies; especially, I think,
amongst the French, whose temper is allowed to be
inore volatile, passionate, sprightly, and gay, than
that os other nations. Some v/ere weeping, tear-
ing themselves in the greatest agonies of sorrow*,
and ruhning'stark "tnad about the ship; while the
rest were stamping with their feet;, wringing their
hands, singing, laughing, swooning away, vomit-'
ing, fainting, with a few returning hearty thanks
to the Almighty, and Crossing themselves. I think,
if 1 am not mistaken, our surgeon was obliged to
Jet thirty of them blood. But among the passen-
gers, there were two priests, the one an old, and
the other a young man; but what aniazed mfe
more, wa*s, that the oldest was irt the worst plight*
for no sooner did he perceive himself freed from
da gerv but he drop's down, as it were without
life, and, to every one's appearance, quite dead';
but the surgeon, chaffing and rubbing his arm, open-
ed a vein, which at first dropped, and then flow^-
ing more freely, the old man began to open his
eyes, and in a quarter of an hour was well again.
But soon remembering his, happy change, thejojr
of whrch whirled bis blood a bo utr faster than the
vessels could convey it, he became so feverish, as
Inade him more fit for bedlam than any other place %
but the surgeon giving him a sleepy dose, he was^
perfectly composed the next morning.
Remarkable indeed wiis the behaviour of the
young priest; At his entrance on board the fhipV
he fellon his face in the most humble prostration
to the Almighty, 1 thought indeed he had fallen
into a swoori^ and so ran to help him up; but her
modestly told me, he was retiirning his thanks to
the Almighty, desiring ine to leave him a few mo-
ments^ and that, next to*his Creator, he would
1 , R 2 return;
return me thanks also; Arid indeed he did* fo^
about three minutes after, with great seriousness
and affection, while the tears stood in his eyes,
which convinced me of the gratitude of his foul.
Nor did he less mew his piety and wisdom, in ap-
plying himself to his country people, and labour-
ing to compose thtrn, by the most powerful rea-
sons, arguments, and persuasions. And when, in-
deed, those people had taken their night's repose,
in such lodgings as our ship would allow, we found
nothing but the best of manners, and the most ci-
vil acknowledgments,, for which the French are
eminently remarkable. The ne^it day the captain,
and one of the priests, desired to speak with me,
and my nephew, the commander. They told us,
that they had saved some money, and valuable
things out of the ruined vessel, which was-at our
service; only that they desired to be set on shore
some where in our way. At the first my nephew
was for accepting the money; but I (who knew
how hard my cafe would have been, had the Por-
tuguese captain served me so) persuaded him to
the contrary ; and therefore told them, that as we
had done nothing but what we were obliged to do,
by nature and humanity, and what we ourselves
might expect from others in such calamity.; so we
took them up to save them, not to plunder them,.
or leave them naked upon the land, to perish for
want of subsistence, and therefore would not ac-
cept their money: but as landing them,, that was
a great difficulty ;_ for, being bound to the East
Indies, it was impossible wilfully to change our
voyage upon their particular account, nor could
jny nephew (who was under charter-party to pur-
sue* it by way of Brasii^answer it to the freighter's.
AU that we could do, was to put ourselves in the
way of meeting some ships homeward bound from
the Wsst Indies^ that if possible they might get a
passage

pafifoge to Fr&iice or England. Indeed they were
very thankful for our first kindness; but were
under great concern, especially the passengers^ at
, their being carried to the East Indies* They beg-
ged therefore I would keep on the banks of New-
Ftiuridlja'nd, Where probably they might meet With
some ship or sloop to carry them to Canada^ whence
they came. As this was but a reasonable request,
I was inclined to grant it, since it wds no breacli
cif charter-party, and that the laws, of God and
tiatlife obliged us to'dd whWgbbd wecbttld to our
^lioW-tfeatlires; and besides, the danger we our-
-felve^ftibuld b$ ittfbr want of pfbviiidns; so wecori-

Icind of square sail upon a jury foremast, because
they could not come near the land, were endea-
vouring to stand for the Canaries; nay, what was
worse, besides aH their fatigue, they were almost
starved for want of provision, having ate nothing .
for eleven days j all that they had aboard was su-
gar, a barrel of fresh water, and ..seven casks of
rum. In this ship were three passengers, a youth,
his mother, and a maid-servant, who were in a
most deplorable condition for want of food. If I
had not gone on board their ship, the knowledge
^Ftheir misery had been concealed from me, and
. they would have inevitably perished; though in-
deed their second mate (who was captain, by rea-
son the true captain was not on board when the
hurricane happened) had before informed me that
there were such persons on-board, whom he sup-
posed to be dead, being afraid to inquire after
them, because he had nothing to give them for
relief. Hereupon we resolved to let them have
what we could spare, ordering the mate to bring
some of his men on board us, which he did accord-
ingly; as he and they looked.like skeletons, when
meat was set before thern^ I ordered them to eat
sparingly. But, however they soon fell sick j,
which obliged the surgeon to mix something in their
broth, which was to be to them, both food and
physic. When they were fed, we ordered our
mate to carry them a sack of bread, and four oir
five pieces of beef; but the surgeon charged them
to see it boileo*, and to keep a guard on the cook-
rocfm, to prevent the men from eating it raw,, and*
consequently killing themselves with what was de-
signed for their relief. But particularly I desired
the mate to fee what condition the poor passengers
were
were in^ and the surgeon gave him a pitcher of the
same broth which he had prepared for the men.
And being curious to fee this scene of misery my-
self, I took the captain (as we called th$ mate of
the ship) in our own boat, and sailed after them.
'Here was a fad fight indeed! scarce were the
victuals half boiled in the pot, but they were rea-
dy to break open the cook-room door. To stay
their stomachs, the mate gave them biscuits, which
were dipped in, and softened with the liquor of
the meat, which they call Breulse; telling them,
it was for their pwn safety, that he was obliged
to give them but a little at a time i and so feeding
them gradually, their bellies were comfortably
filled, and the men did very well again. But when
they came-to the poor gentlewoman in the cabint,
who for several days had continued without food^
giving what she had to her son, they found her as
it were in the arms of death. She was sitting up-
on the floor of the deck, with her back up against
the (ides, between two chairs, which were lashed-
fast, and her head shrunk between her shoulders,
like a senseless corpse - Nothing was wanting in
my mate to revive and encourage her; opening
her lips, and putting some broth into her mouth
with a spoon. But not having strength to speak,
she lifted up her head with much difficulty,, inti-
mating that it was now too late i at the fame time
pointing to the youth her son, a& though she desi-
red him to do what he could to save the lad; and
in a little after (he died.
The youth indeed was not so far gone, yet lay
stretched out in a cabin bed, like one that had
-scarce any life. In his mouth was a piece of an
old glove^ the rest of which he had ate up. At
first he vomited what the mate had given him; but
at length began sensibly to revive, though in the

them on board with all their goods, except eleven
hogsheads of sugar; but the youth having a bill of
lading, I made the commander oblige himself to
deliver a letter and the deceased widow's goods to
Mr. Rogers, a merchant in Bristol; but I believe
the ship was lost at sea, for we could never hear
what became of her afterwards. We were now
in the latitude of 19 deg. 32 min. having as yet a
tolerable good voyage. But, passing by several
little incidents relating to wind and weather, I
shall relate what is more remarkable concerning
my little kingdom, to which I was then drawing
near. I had great difficulty in finding it; fcfr as
I came to, and went from it before, on the south
and east fide of the island, as coming from the
.Braiils; so now approaching between the main
and the island, not having any chart for the coast,
nor land-mark, it obliged us tol go on shore
on several islands in the mouth of the river O-
roonoko, but to no purpose. This I percei-
ved, that what I thought was a continent before,
was no such thing, but a long island,. or rather a
ridge of sands. On one of these islands 1 found
some Spaniards, but they belonged tp the isle de
Trinidad, who came hither in a stoop to make salt,
and to try to find some pearl musles. But at
length I came fair on the south fide of my island,
and then I presently knew the countenance of my
little kingdom, so we brought the ship safe to an
anchor, broadside wjthin the little creek, where
stood my ancient and venerable castle.
"No sooner did I see the place, but calling for
Friday, I asked "him where he was? But when he
looked a little, he clapped his hands, crying, 0
joysy 0 there, 0 yes, 0 there! pointing to our old
abode.

abode, and then fell a dancing and capering as if
he was Mad, and I had much ado t6 keep him from
jumping into the sea, to swim ashore. Friday,
said I, what do yoti thirik, shall we go see ydur
father? At the nieiitibning his fathers name the
poor affectionate creature 'fell a weeping; -N~o no,

spective glass, was true, by Svhat the men therif-
.-selves told Me the next day.
When the English ancient was spreads and thfefe
gu'fts fired as a signal of friendship; we perceived
a smoke rise from the creek; upon which I order-
ed the boat out, tkkittg Friday with me, and hang-
ing but h whfte fkg, of truce, I went on shore, ac-
companied also by the young friar, to whom I had

they ndt let the boat go. -No footer was he oh

would lye upon the ground, strode,,his legs, and
Mss them, then get-up and "stare at him, as though
i\e was; bewitched i bus the next day; one could
not forbear lighter to fee his hehaviqu/r,, for he
woujd walk several hours with his father along
the shore, leading nimby the hand, as,though he
was a lady 5 while, every now and then he would,
r.un to the boat, to get something for him, as a
lump of. sugar, dram, biscuit, or something or o-
tjier that was good. His froliqs ran in another
channel- in the afternoon,- for when he set old;
Friday on the ground, be would dance, round Ivm,
leaking c6mical postures ana1 "gestures:, and allthis
while would be telling him one story or other of
his travels and.adventures*
It was on the 10th of April* anno 1695, that I,
, set my foot upon the island a second lime. When
ray faithful Spaniard, accompanied by one more,
approached the boat, he little knew who I was%
till I discovered myself to him: Signior, Aud I,
in Portuguese, don't you know me? he spoke ne-
ver a word^ but giving his musket to his attend-
ant, extended his arms, and saying something in
Spanish, that I did not then Understand, he came
forward and embraced me, saying, he was inex-
cuscable, not to know-.his deJiverer; who, like
an angel.sent from fyeaven, had saved his life. He
then beckoned to. the man to call out h»s^compa-
nions, asking me, if 1 would walk to my own ha-
bitation, and tajee possession, where I mould find:
sprae mean improvements: but indeed they were
extraordinary ones; for they had planted so raa.
ny trees so close together, that the place was like
a labyrinth, which none could find out, except
themselves, who knew its intricate windings, I;
asked him the meaning of all these fortifications;
he
lie told me he would give me a large account of
•what had passed since my departure to this time,
and how he had subdued some English, who thought
to be their "murderers* hoping I would not be dis-
pleased, since necessity compelled them to it. As
I knew they were wicked villains, so I told him,
that I was not only far from finding fault with it,
but was rather heartily glad that they had subdu-
ed them. While we were thus talking, the man
whom he had sent returned, accompanied by ele-
ven more, but in such habits, that it was impos-
sible to tell what nations they werev of. He first
turned to me, and pointing to them; These, Sir,
said he, are some of the gentlemen who owe their
lives to your goodness; then turning-to them, and
pointing to m£, he made them sensible who I was:
and then indeed they saluted me one by one; not
as ordinary men, but as though they bad been
ambassadors or noblemen, and I a triumphant con-
queror; for their behaviour not only agreed with
a manlike, majestic gravity, but at the fame time
was To obliging and courteous, as made them ad-
mirable to the last degree.
Before I relate the history of the transactions
of my kingdom, as I had it Troni the Spaniard's
own mouth, I must here insert what I omitted in
my former relation. The matter is this: Just be-
fore we weighed anchor to set sail, there happen-
ed a quarrel on board the ship, which had like to
have occasioned a second mutiny, till such time as
the courageous captain taking two of the most re-
fractory prisoners, laid them in irons, threatening,
as they were concerned in the former disorders,
to have them hanged in England for running a-
way with the ship. This frightened some of the
rest, as thinking the captain would serve them in
the fame manner, though he seemed to give them
good words for the present. But the mate having
; intelligence.
6V ftOBINSON C RijSOt. itos
intelligence of tftiis, made me acquainted wMi their
fears'; To that, to make them more easy, and our-
selves more safe from their conspiracies, I was p-
bliged to go down, arid pass niy honour's word
for it, that, upon their good behaviour, all that
was palIfhoutd be pardoned; in testimony of which
1 ordered the two men's irons to be taken off, and
themselves forgiven. But as this had brought us
to an anchor that night, in which there was a
calm, the two men that ha& been in irons, stole
each of them a nfuiket, and some other weapons,
and taking the strip's pinnace, not yet haled up,
fan away to their brother rogues* The next
morning; we sent the lopg-boat, with men to pur-
sue them; but all in vain: the mate, in revenge,
would have demoKmed my little castle, burnt its
furniture, and deftroyed their plantations; but
having no orders for it, he did not put it in exe-
cituon. And thus there were five Englishman in
the iflarid, which caused great differences, as my
faithful Spaniard gave me a perfect account of, in
the following manner:
You cannot, Sir, but remember the embassy you
lent me about, and what a disappointment we met
with, by your absence, at our return. There is
but little variety in the relation of our voyage,
being blessed with calm weather, and a smooth sea.^
Great indeed was the joy of my cbuntrymen, to
x fee me alive, having acted as the principal man
onboard, the captain of the ship wrecked vessel
dying before; nor was their surprise less, as know-
* iiig 1 was taken prisoner by the savages of ano-
ther nation, they thought me long since entombed
in their monstrous bowels. But when I /hewed
them the arms, ammunition, and provisions I had
brought for them, they looked upon me as a £e-
>cdi$ Joseph advanced in Pharoah's court, and im-
mediately prepared to come along with me. In-
S de£d
deed they were obliged to trespass upon their friend-
ly savages by borrowing two of their canoes, un-
der a pretext for fishing: and they came away
the next morning, but without any provisions of
tlieir own$ except a few roots, which served them
instead of bread. After three weeks absence, we
arrived at your habitation. Here we met with
three English sailors, who, I confess, gave us pro-
visions, and that letter of direction you had left
for us, which informed us how to bring up tame
goats, plant corn, cure grapes, make pots; and
in short, every thing that was necessary for our
use; as, in particular, 1 knew your method best,
so tajung Friday's father to assist me, we managed
all the affairs; nor were the rest of the Spaniards
wanting in their kind offices, dressing food for the
Englishmen, who did nothing but ramble and di-
vert themselves in the woods, either mooting par-
rots, or catching tortoises. But we had not been
long ashore, before we were informed of two more
Englishmen, unnaturally turned out of their com-
mon place of residence by the three others above
mentioned: this made my Spaniards and me (whom
they now looked upon as their governor in your
absence) endeavour to persuade them to take them
in, that we might be as one family; but all our
intreaties were in vain, so that the poor fellows,
finding nothing to be done without industry, pitch-
ed there tents on the north side of the ifland, a
little inclining to the west, for fear of savages.
Here they, built two huts, one to lodge, and the
other to lay their stores in; for my good hatured
Spaniards giving them some seeds, they dtig and
planted as 1 had done, and began to live prettily.
But while they were thus comfortably going on,
the three unnatural brutes, their countrymen, in
a mere bullying humour, insulted them, by say-
ing, the governor (meaning you) had given theni
possession
possession of the islands and d-4htr 'enij 'they
should build no houses upon their ground, with-
out paying rent. The two honest men*(for so let
me now distinguish them) thought their tm:ee
countrymen only jested, and one of them invited
them in, to see their fine habitations ^ while the
other facetiously told them, that since they built
tenements, with great improvements, they should,,
according to the custom of landlords, give them a
longer lease; at the same time desiring them to
fetch a scrivener to draw the-writings. One of
the Wretches swearing he should pay for the jest,
snatches up a firebrand, and clapping it to the
outside of their hut, very fairly set it on fire,
which would soon have consumed it, had not the
honest man thrust him away, and trod it out with
with his feet.' Hereupon the fellow returns with
a pole, with which he would have ended his days,
had not the poor man avoided the blow; when
fetching his musket, he knocked down the villain
that began the quarrel. The other two coming
to assist their fellow^ obliged the hpnest man to
take his musket also, and both of them presenting
their pieces, bid the villains stand off; and if they
did not lay down their arms, death should decide the
dispute oneway or other. This brought them to a
parley, in which they agreed to take their wound-
ed man and be~gone; but they were In the wrong
that they did not disarm them when they had the
power, and then make their complaint to me and
my Spaniards for justice, which might have pre-
vented their farther designs against them. And
indeed so many trespasses did they afterwards com-
vmit;, by treading,down their corn, shooting their
young kids and goats, and plaguing them night and
day, that they resolved to come to my castle, chal-
lenge all the three, and decide their right by one
plain battle, while theSpaniards stood by to fee

Spaniards (one of whom upd(|r%qd English,) t>e~"

men* who complained how barbarous their couo-

them of their subsistence; th^t if we did not grant
them relief, they must be inevitably starved; andi
so they parted: buj: when my Spaniards qame hom#

them began to reprehend the Englishmen, but irt

tion; not by sire, as they attempted before, but
pulled down their houses, limb from limb, not lea-
ving stick nor stone on the ground where they stood,'
broke their household stuff in pieces, tore up their
trees, spoiled their inclosures; and, in fliort, quite
ruined them of every thing they had. Had these
people met together, no doubt but there would
have been a bloody battle; but Providence order-
ed it for the better; for just as the three were*
got thither, the two were at our castle; aud when
they left us, the three came back again, but in a
great ragfc, scoffingly telling us what they had
done; when one taking hold of a Spaniard's hat,
twirls it round, saying, And you, Seignior, Jack
Spaniard, Jhall have the same sauce; if you dont
mend your manners. My Spaniard, a grave, but
courageous man, knocked him down with one
blow of his fist; at which another villain fired his
pistol, and narrowly missed his body, but wound-
ed him a little in the ear. Hereat enraged, the
Spaniard takes up the fellow's musket whom he'
had knocked down, and would have shot him, if I
and the rest had not come out, and taken their arms
from every one of them.
These Englishmen perceiving they had made all
df us their enemies, began to cool % but notwith-
standing their better words, the Spaniards would
not return them their arms again, telling them,
they would do them no manner of harm, if they,
would live peaceably; but if they-offered any in-
jury to the plantation or castle, they would moot
them as they would do ravenous beasts. This
made them so mad, that they went away raging
like furies of hell. They were no sooner gone,

the other three fhoujd make them restitution, by
building their two huts, and fencing their ground

this arpresent, and lived some, time: regularly er
^ouglv except as to the working part, whkh they
did not cars for, but the Spaniards would ba\?e:

scarce had them a week, when they became a&

things are not to be slighted; foi? certainly there
is sotee mischief plotting near us. Where ^re the
Englishmen 3 said I. Me answered,, in their huts \
for they lay separate frcmi us, Sir, since the last
mutiny. Weil), said I, some kind spirit gives this
information for our advantage. Come let us get
abroad, and fee if any thing offers to justify our
fears. - Uppji which, I and some of my Spaniards
went up the mountain, not by the ladder^ but
through the groove; and then we were struck with
a panic fear on feeing a light, as though it were a
£re, at a very little drstancey and hearing the voice
of several men. Hereupon we retreated immedi-
ately, and raising the rest of our forces, made
them sensible of the impending danger: but, with
all ray authority, I could not make them stay where
they were, so earnest were they to see how things
went. Indeed the darkness, of the night gave them
opportunity enough to view them (by the light of
their fire) undiscovered. As they were in differ-
ent parties, .and straggling over the shore, we
were much afraul that they should find out our ha*
bitations, and destroy our flocks of goats; tp pre-
vent which, we sent an Engineman and two Spa?
niards to> drive the goats into the valley-where the
eave lay; or, if there was occasion, into the cave
itself. As to ourselves, resuming 6ur native eoii-
uage,< and prudent conduc\ had we not been divi-
ded, we durst venture to attack a hundred of
^them j but before. it#was yet light, W& resolved to
send

ly stripped himself naked, gets among them undis«r

they were two parties of two different nationsti
Who lately having a bloody battle with one ano-
ther, happened to land by mere chanee in tne fame
island, to devour their miserable prisoners i that
they were entirely ignorant of any person's inha-
biting here; but rather being filled with rage and
fury against one another, he believed, that as soon
as day-light appeared, there would be a terrible
engagement. Old Friday had scarce ended his re-
lation when we heard an uncommon noise, and
perceived that there was a horrid engagement be-
tween the two armies.
Such was the curiosity of our party, especially
the Englishmen, that they would not lye close,'
though Old Friday told them their safety depend-
ed upon it"; and that if we had patience, we should
behold* the savages kill one another. However*
they used some caution, by going further into the
woods, and placing themselves in a convenient
place to behold the battle."
Never could there be a more bloody engage-
ment,-nor men of more invincible spirits, and pru-
dent conduct, according to their way and manner
of fighting. It lasted near two hours, till that
party which was nearest to our castle began to de-
cline, and at last to fly from their conquerors.
We were undoubtedly put into a great consterna-
tion on this account, lest they should run into our
grove, and consequently briag us into the like
danger* Hereupon we resolved to kill thp first
that came, to prevent discovery; and: that too
with our swords, and the butt end of our mus-
kets^ fpr fear the report of our guns should be
heard.  •.••...•;,, -v "•"'"•• • '" >'. "•

was,
was, whether, as we perceived the savages haunt-
ed that fide of the island, and there being more
retired parts of it, and yet as well suited to our
manner of living, and equally to our advantage,
we ought not rather to move our place of residence,
and plant it in a much safer place, both for the
security of our corn and cattle.
After a long debate on this head, it was resol-
ved, or rather voted ncmine contradtcente, not to
remove our ancient castle, and that for this very
good reason, that-some time or other we expected
to hear from our supreme governor (meaning you
Sir,) whose messengers not finding us there, might
think the place demolished, and allhis subjects de-
stroyed by the savages.
As to the next concern relating to our corii
. and cattle, we consented to have them removed
to the valley where the cave was, that being most
proper and sufficient for both. But yet, when we
considered further j we altered one part of our re-
solution; which was, to remove part of our cattle
hither, and plant only part of our com there: so
that in case one part was destroyed,' the other
might be preserved. Another resolution we took,
w^hich really had a great deal of prudence in it;
and that was, in not trusting the three savages
whom We had taken prisoners, with any know-
ledge of the plantations which we had made in the
valley, of what number4 of cattle we had there,
much less of the cave, wherein we kept several
arms, arid two barrels of powder you left for us,
at your departure from this island. But though
we would not change oiir habitation, we resolved
tdiiiakeit more fortified and more secret. To
thftfend, Sir, as you had planted trees at some di-
stance before the entrance of your palace; so we,
imitating your example, planted and filled up the
whole space bf< ground, even to the banks, of the -
creek,
creek, nay, into the very ooze, where the tide
flowed, not leaving a place for landing: and a-
mong, those I had planted, they had intermingled
so many short ones, all of which growing wonder-
fully fast and thick, a little dog scarcely could find
a passage through them. Nor was this sufficient,
as we thought; for we did the fame to all the,
ground, to the right and left hand of vis, even to
the top of the hill, without so much as leaving sk
passage for ourselves except by the ladder: which
being taken down, nothing but what had wings or
witchcraft could pretend to come near us. And
indeed this was exceedingly well contrived, espe-
cially to serve that occasion, for which we after-
wards found it necessary.
Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement,
having all this time not one visit from the sava-
ges. Indeed one morning we had an alarm, which
put us in some amazement; for a few of my Spa-
niards being out very early, perceived no less than
twenty canoes, as it were coming on shore; upon
which, returning home, with great precipitation,
they gave us the alarm, which obliged us to keep
at home all that day and the next,.going out only
in the night-time to make our observation : but
as good luck would have it* they were upon ano-
ther design, and did not land that time upon the
island., /
But now there happened another quarrel be-
tween the three wicked Englishmen, and some of
my Spaniards. The occasion was, this: One of
them being enraged at one of the savages, whom
he had taken prisoner, for not being able to com-
prehend something which he was shewing him,
snatched up a hatchet in a great fury, not to cor-*
rect, but to kill him; yet missing his head, gave
him such a barbarous cut in the shoulder, that he
had like to have struck off his arms at which one
of
2.i6 Ll¥fe A:isr d AtovfeN^liiiES
bis'my gbcxKnkturgd Spaniards int£rp6sed between
the Englishman and savage, beseeched the former
tidt to murder the ptoor creature; but this kind-
ness had like to have cost the Spaniard his life,
for the Englishman struck at him in the fame man-
ner, which he ftiirfbfy and Wisely avoiding, return-*
fed suddenly 'upon him with his shovel (be'irfg all at
toork about their Cdnv-lana1,) and v'ery raiHy knoclc-
€d she brutish creatiire down. Hereupon another
Englishman, coming to his fellow's assistance, laid
the good Spaniard cm the earth; when immediate-
ly two others coming to his relief, were attacked
by the* third Englishman, arnied With aii old cut-,
lass, who wounded them both. This Uproar sddii
reached our ears, when we rumlhg ont Updn then/,
took the three Erfglfmniert prisoners; arid then
our next question Was', what should be dorte to
such mutinous arid itnpuderit Fellows, Ib furiotis,
desperate, auditive, that^hey wer'e mischi'eVo'us to
tfie highest degree, and consequently riot safe for
Æe 'society to let them liv'e afm6ng them.
Now,- Sir, as I was governor in ycmr absences
so I also tdok the authority4 of a jud#e; and ha-
ving them brbught before me, 1 told them, that if
, they had been of my country, I would have hing-
ed every Mother's son of them; but Once it was an
Englishman (meaning you, kind Sir,) to whom
we were indebted for our preservation and delive-
rance, I wduld in gratitude use them with all pos-
sible mildnese; hiit at the fanie time leaving them,
to the judgment 'of the otheV two Englishmen, who,
I hopetl, forgetting their resentments, would deal
iihpartiallyby them.
Hereupon one of his countrymen stood up: 5/r,
said life, leave ft hot to us, for < you piky be sensible
itiehkvt rehfoh to sentence them to the galloivs:
Besides, &tr,*ih'is felloe] Will Atkins arid tbxe*t<wo
(fibcrr, frbptised to us7 that *we thigfat murder you
all
all In your fleep^ which we would not consent to;
hut knowing their Inability, and your vigilance, we
did not think fit to discover it before now..
How Seignior, said I, do you hear what is aU
ledgqd against }'ou? what can ypu sey to justify
so horrid an action, as to murder us in cold blood?
p.p far, Sir, was the wretch from denying it, -that
he swore, d-mn him but he would do it still• But
what have we clone to you Seignior Atkins, said 1^
or what will you gain by killing us? What shall
we do to prevent you? must we kill you, or you
kill us: Why will you, Seignior Atkins, (saidvE
smiling,) put us to such an unhappy dilemma, such
a fatal necessity? But so great a rage did my scof-
fing, and yet seyer-e jest, put him into, that" he
was going to fly at me, and undoubtedly had at-
tempted to kill me if he had been possessed of wea-
pons, and had npt been ,prevented by three Spa-
niards. This unparalleled and villainous carri-
age, made us, seriously consider what was to be
done, The two Englissirperi and the Spaniard, .
.who had saved the poor Indian's life mightily pe-
titioned me to hang one of them, for an example
to the others, which should be him that had twice
attempted to commit murder with his hatchet, it
being at that time thought impossible the poor slave
fhouId recpver. But they could xiever gain my
consent to put him to death, for the reasons above-
mentioned, lince it was an Englishman (even your-
self) who was my deliverer, and as merciful coun-
sels are most prevailing, when earnestly pressed,
so I got them to be of the same opinion as to cle-
mency. But, tp prevent tbeir doing us any fur*
ther mischief, we a|l agreed, that they {hould have
•no weapons, as swor4, gun, powder, or shot, but
he expelled from the society, to live as they plea-
4ed, by themselves; frhat neither the two Englifh-
i^en, ptGr the res} of the Spaniards,: should have
T conversation
conversation with them upon any account whatso-
ever: that they should be kept from coming with-
in a certain distance of our castle; and if they da-
red to offer us any violence, either by spoiling,
burning, killing, or destroying any of the corn,
plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belonging
to the society, we would shoot therh as freely as
we would do beasts of prey, in whatsoever places
we should find them.
This sentence seemed very just to all but them-
selves; when, like a merciful judge, I called out
to the two honest Englishmen, faying, You must
consider they ought not to be starved neither;
and since it will be some time before they can raise
corn and* cattle of their own, let us give them
•some corn to last them eight months, and for feed
to sow, by which time they'll raise somefor them-
selves: let us also bestow upon,them fix milk-
goats, four he-dties, and six kids, as well for their
present support, as for a further increase; with
tools neceflary for their work, as hatchets, an axe,
saw, and other things convenient to build them
huts: all which were agreed to; but before they
took them in possession, I obliged them solemnly
to swear, never to attempt any thing against us
or their countrymen for the future. Thus dis-
missing them from our society, they went away,
sullen and refractory, as though neither willing to
go nor stay j however, seeing no remedy, they
took what provision was given them, proposing^
to chuse a convenient place, where they might live
by themselves.
About five days after, they came to those limits
appointed, in order for more victuals, and sent me
•word by one of my Spaniards, whom they called
to, where they had pitched their tents, and mark-
ed themselves out an habitation and plantation, at
..the'N. E. and most remote part of the island. And
indeed
indeed there they built themselves two very hand-
some cottages, resembling our little castle, being
under the side of a mountain, with some trees al-
ready growing on three fides of it, so that plant-
ing a few more, it would be obscured, from-sight,
unless particularly sought for. When these huts
were finished, we gave them some dry goat-skins
for bedding and covering; and upon their giving
us fuller assurances of their good behaviour for
the future, we gave them some pease, barley, arid
rice for sowing, and whatever tools we could spare.
Six months did they live in this separate condi-
tion, inwjiich they got their first harvest in, the
quantity of which was but small, because they liad
planted but little land: for indeed, all their plan-
tations being to form, made it the more difficult,
especially as it was a thing out of their element:
and when they were obliged to make their boards
and pots, &c. they could make little or nothing
of it. But the rainy season coming on, put them
into, a greater perplexity for want of a cave to
keep their corn dry, and prevent it from spoiling:
and so much did this humble them, that they beg-
ged of my Spaniards to help them, to which the
good-natured men readily consented, and in four
days space worked a great hole in the side of the
hill for them, large enough for their purpose, to*
secure.their corn and other things from the rain,
though not comparable to ours, which had several
additional apartments.
But a new whim possessed these rogues about
three quarters of a year after, which had like to
have ruined us and themselves too: for, it seems
being tired and weary of this fort of Jiving, which
made them work for themselves, without hopes of
changing their condition, nothing would serve*
them, but they would make a voyage to the con-
tinent, and try if they could seize upon some of
T 2. tte
the savages, and bring them over as slaves, to do*
their-drudgesy, while they lived at ease and plea-
sure.
Indeed the project was not so preposterous, if
they had not gone farther; but they neither did,,
iior proposed any thing, but what had mischief in
the design, or the event. One morning these three
fellows came down to the limited station, and hum-
bly desired to be admitted to talk with us: which
we readily granted *, they told us; in short, that
being tired of their manner of living, and the la*
bour of their hands, in such employments, nor be-
ing sufficient to procure the necessaries of life,,
they only desired one of the canoes we came over1
ify with some arms and ammunition, for their de-
fence, and they would seek their fortunes abroad,,
find never trouble us any more To be sure, w&
were glad enough to get rid of such wretches
plagues; but yet honesty made us, ingenuously re*
present to them, by what w& ourselves had suffer-1
fed, the certain destruction they were running into,,
either of being starved to death, dr murdered by
the savages. To this they very audaciously fe*
plied, that they neither could nor would work J;
$nd consequently, that they-might as well- be star-*
ved abroad as at home: and as to their falling in*
to the hands df the savages, why, if they were
murdered, that was nothing to us, there was an
fend of them, neither had they any wives or chil*
dren to cry after them; nay, so intent were they
Upon their vdyage^ that if the Spaniards had not
given them arms, so they had but the canoe, they
Wdtikl have gone without them.
Though we could not well spare our fire-arms,
father then they should go like naked men, we let
them have two muskets, a pistol, a cu lass, and
three hatchets, which were thought very sufficient i*
we gave them also goats flesli, a great basket foil
of
of dried grapes, a pot of fresh butter, a young
live kid, anda large canoe sufficient to carry twen-
ty men. And thus, with a matt made of a long
pole, and a fail of fix large goats skins dried, ha-
ving a fair breeze, and a flood tide with them,
they merrily failed away, the Spaniards calling af-
ter them, Bon veyajo, no man ever expecting to-
fee them more.'  -W 
When they were gone, the Spaniards and Eng-
lishmen would often say one to another, 0 haw'
peaceable Jo, we now live, since those turbulent fel-
lows have'left us? Nothing could be farther from
their thoughts, than to behold their faces any more;
and yet scarce two and twenty days had passed
over their heads, but one of the Englishmen, being
abroad a-planting, perceived at a distance, three
men well armed, approaching towards him. Away
he sties with speed to our castle, and tells me and
the reff, that we Were all undone, for that, stran-
gers were landed upon the island, and who they
were he could not tell; but added, that they were
not savages, but men habited, bearing arms* Why
then, said I, we have the less occasion to be con-
cerned, since, if they ^are not Indians, they mi*ft
be friends; for I am sure there is no Christian
people upon earth, but what will do us good ra-
ther than harm* But while we were considering
os the event, up came the three Englishmen, whose
voices we quickly knew, and so all our admira-
tion of that nature ceased at once. And our won-
der was succeeded by another sort, of inquiry,
which was, what could be the occasion of their re-
turning so quickly to the island, when we little ex-
pected, and much less desired their company? But
as this was better toybe related by themselves, I
ordered them to be brought in, when they gave
me the following relation ot\their voyage:
. After two days fail, or something less, they
T 3 reached
reached land, where they found the people comings
to give them another sort of reception than what
.they expected or desired: for as the savages were
armed with-bows and arrows, they durst not ven-
ture on shore, but steered northward, iix or seven
hours, till they gained an opening, by which they
plainly perceived, j:hat the land that appeared from-
this place was not the main land, but the island..
At their entrance into the opening of the sea^,
they discovered another island, on the right hand-
- northward, and several more lying to the west-
ward; but being resolved so go on shore some-
where or other, they put over to one of the wes-
tern islands. Here they found the natives very
courteous to them, giving them several roots and
dried fish;. nay, even their women too were as
willing to supply them with what they could pro-
cure them to eat, bringing it a great way to them
upon their heads. Among these hospitable Indians
they continued some days, inquiring by signs and
tokens, what nations lay around them; and wrere*
informed, that there were several fierce and ter-
rible people lived every way, accustomed to eat
mankind.: but for themselves, they never used
such diet, except those that were taken in battle,,
and of them they made a solemn feast'l
The Englislimen inquired how long it was since
they had a feast of that kind? They answered, a.-
"bout two moons ago, pointing to the moon; and
then to two fingers; that, at this time, their king
had two hundred prisoners, which were fattening
up for the slaughter. The Englislimen were mighty
desirous of feeing the prisoners, which .the others-
mistaking, thought they wanted some of them for
their own food: upon which they beckoned to
them, pointing to the rising, and^ then to the set-
ting of the sun; meaning, that by the time it ap-
peared in the east next morning, they would bring
them
them some: and indeed they were as good as their
word; for by that time they brought eleven men
and five women, just as so many cows and ox era
are brought to sea*port towns, to victual a ship.
But as brutish as these Englishmen were, their
stomachs turned at the sight. What to do in this
cafe, they could not tell: to refuse the prisoners^
would have been the highest affront offered to the
savage gentry; £nd to dispose of them, they knew
not in what manner: however, they resolved to
accept them, and so ga\»e them, in return^ one
of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and fix or
seven of their bullets: things which though they*
were wholly ignorant of, yet seemed entirely corn-
tented with; and dragging the poor wretches irita
the boat, with their hands bound behind them, de*-
livered them to the. Englishmen* But this obliged
them to put off as soon as they had these presents,
lest the donors should have expected two or three
of them to be killed, and to be invited to dinner
the next day: and so'taking leave with all possible
respect and tharjks, though neither of them under-
stood what the other said, they sailed away back
to the first island, and there set eight of the pri*
soners at liberty. In their voyage they endeavour-
ed to comfort, and have some conversation with
the poor captives; but it was impossible to make
them sensible of any thing; and nothing they could
say, dr give, or do for them, could make them
otherwise persuaded, but that they were unbound
only to be devoured: if they give them any food,
they thought it was only to fatten them for the
slaughter; or looked at any one more particular-
ly, the poor creature supposed itself to be the first
sacrifice: and even when we brought them to our
island, and began to use them with the greatest
humanity and kindness, yet they expected every-
day that, their new masters would devour them. -
And
And thus, Sir, did these three strange wander*
ers conclude their unaccountable relation of their
voyage, which was both amazing and entertain-
ing. Hereupon 1 asked them, where their new
family was? They told me, they had , put then*
into one of their huts, and they came to beg some
victuals for them. This, indeed, made us all long
to fee them; and so taking Friday's father with
us, leaving only two at our castle, w« came down
to behold those poor creatures.
When we arrived at the hut, (they being bound
again by the Englishmen* for fjsar of escaping,)
we "found them stark naked, expecting their fatal
tragedy: there were three lusty men, well shaped,
with straight and fair limbs, between thirty and
five and thirty years old; and five women J two of
them might be from thirty to forty,, two more,
not above four and twenty ; and the last a comely
tali maiden of about, seventeen. Indeed, all the
women were very agreeable, both in their pro-
portion and features, except that they were tawny,
which their modest behaviour and other graces
made amends for, ?when they afterwards came to
be cloathed.
~ This naked, appearance, together with their mi-
serable circumstances, was no very comfortable
light to my Spaniards, who, for their parts, I may
venture, Sir, without flattery, to fay, are men
of the best behaviour, calmest tempers* and sweet-
est nature, that can possibly be; for they imme-
diately ordered Friday's father to fee if he knew
any of them,, or if he understood what they could
fay. No sooner did the old Indian appear, but,fye
looked at them with great -seriousness-; yet, as
they were not of his nation, they were utter stran-
gers to him, and none could understand, his speech
or signs, but one woman. This was enough to
answer the design, which was to assure them they
would
#ould not be killed, being fallen into the hands
of Christians, who abhorred sudh barbarity. When
they were fully satisfied of this, they expressed
their j oy* by such strange gestures, aitd imcom*
iritfn tones, as it is not possible for me to describe.
But the woman, their interpreter, was ordered
next to inquire, whether they were content to
be servants, arid would work for the men, who
had brought them hither to save their lives? Here-
upon (being at this time unbound) they fell a ca-
pering and dancing, one taking this thing upon her
moulders, and the other that, intimating, that?
they were willing to do any thing for them. But
now, Sir, having women among us, and dreading
that it might occasion some strife, if not blood, I
asked the three men what they would do, and hoW
they intended to use these creatures, whether as
servants or women? One of them very pertly
and Readily answered, they would use them as
both. Gentlemen, said I, as you are your own
masters, I am not going to restrain you from that}
but, metbinks, for avoiding dissension among you,
I would only desire you to engage, that none of
you will take more than one for a woman or a
wife, and that having taken this one, none else
should presume to touch her; for though we have
not a priestly authority to marry you, yet It h
but reasonable, that whoever thus takes a woman*
sliouid be obliged to maintain her, since nobody
else has any thing to do with her: and this indeed
appeared so just to all present, that it was unani-
mously agreed to. The Englishmen then afk&l my
Spaniards, whether they designed to take any of
them? but they all answered. No; some decla-
ring they had already wives in Spain j and others,
that they cared not to join with infidels. On the
reverse, the Englishmen took each of them a ten>
porary wife, and so setup a new method of living*
As
As to Friday's father, the Spaniards, and the
three savag^ servants we had taken in the late bat-
tle, thpy all lived with me in our ancient castle;
and indeed we supplied the main? part of the island-
with food, as necessity required. But the most re-
markable part of the story is, how these English-
men, who had been so much at variance, should
agree about the choice of these women; yet they
took a way good enough to prevent quarrelling
among themselves. They set; the five women in
one of their huts, and going themselves to the o~
ther, drew lots which should have the first choice.
Now, he that had thg first lot went to the hut,;
and fetched out her he chose, and it is remarkable,
that he took her that was the most homely and
eldest of the number, which made the rest of the
Englishmen exceeding merry* The Spaniards
themselves could, not but smile at it: but, as it
happened, the fellow had the best thought, in
chusing one fit for application and business: and
indeed she proved the best wife of all the parcel.
But when the poor creatures perceived ,them-
ves placed in a row, and separated one by one,
they were again seized with an unspeakable ter-
ror, as now thinking they were going to be (bin
in earnest: and when the Englishmen came to
take the first, the rest set tip a lamentable cry,
clapt their arms around her neck, and hanging
about her, took their last farewell, as they thought,,
in such trembling agonies, and affectionate embra-
ces, as would have softened the hardest heart in
the world, and made the dryest eyes melt into
tears; nor could they be persuaded, but that they
were going to die, till such time as iFriday's fa-
ther made them sensible that the Englishmen had
chosen them for their wives, which ended all their
terror and concern upon this occasion.*
, Well> after this, the Englishmen went to work*
, and
arid being assisted by my gbod-natured Spaniards,
in a few hours they erected every one of them a
new hut or tent, for their separate lodging, since
those they had already were filled with tools,
household stuff, and provision. They all continu-
ed on the north share pf the island, but separate
as before; the threewicked ones pitchiug farther
off, and the two honest men nearer oiir castle; so
that the island seemed to be peopled in three pla-
ces, three towns beginning to bet built for that
purpose. And here I cannot but remark, what is
very common, that the two honest men had the,
worst wives, (I mean as to industry, cleanliness,
and ingenuity,) while the three reprobates enjoy-
ed women of quite contrary qualities.
But another observation I made was, in favour
of the two honest men, to mew what disparity
there is between a diligent application to business
on the one hand, and a slothful, negligent, and
idle temper, on the other. Both of them had the
fame parcel of ground laid out, and corn to sow,
sufficient for them ; but both did not make the same
improvements, either in their cultivation, or in
their planting. The two honest men had a multi-
tude of young trees planted about their habitations,
so that when you approached near them, nothing
appeared but a wood, very pleasing and delight-
ful. Every thing they did prospered and flourifh-
»ed; their grapes planted in order, seemed as tho*
managed in a vineyard, and were infinitely pre-
ferable to any of the others. Nor were they
wanting to find out a place of retreat, but dug a
x:ave in the mqst retired part of a thick wood, to
secure their wives and children, with their provi-
sion and chiefest goods, surrounded with innume-
rable stakes, and having a most subtle entrance,
in case any mischief should happen either from
theif > fellow-countrymen, or the devouring sa-
vages.
$23 LIFE imp Any^NTUHES
As to the reproh&tes, (though I mast own they
were much civilised than before,) instead of a
delightful wood surrounding their dwelling w$
found the words of King Solomon too truly veri*
fied;. I went by the vineyard of the Jlothful, and
it was all overgrown with thtrns* In many places
their crop was obscured with weeds; the hedges
having several gaps, in them, the wild goats had
got in, and ea^en up the corn, and here and ther?
was a dead bush, to stop in those gaps for the prer
sent, which was no more than {hutting the stabler
door after the steed was stolen away. But as to
their wives, they (as I observed before) were more
diligent, and cleanly enpugh, especially in their
victuals, being instructed by one of the hone/j
men, who had been a cook's mate pn board a flijip:
and very well it was so 5 for as he cooked himself,
"Jiis companions and their families lived as well as
she idle husbands, who did nothing but loiter ar
bout, fetch turtles eggs, catch fish and birds, an$
do any thing hut work, and lived accordingly,
while the diligent lived very handsomely and plen-
tifully, in the most comfortable manner. And
now, Sir, I come to lay before your eyes a scenes
quite different from any thing that ever happened
us before, and perhaps ever b^fel you jn all the
time of your residence on this island. I shall in-
form ypu of its original in the following manner:
One morning, Sir, very early, there came fiv£
or six canoes of Indians on shore, indisputably
upon th§ir old custom of devouring their priso-
ners. All that we had tto do upon such an occa,-
iipn, was tp lye concealed, that they, not having
;any notice of inhabitants, might depart quietly,
after performing their bloody ex^cutipiM who?-
ever first discovered the savages, was to give no-
tice to all the three plantations to keep wijh|n.
doors j and then a proper scout was to be pla<ce4
to give intelligence of their departure. But, not*
withstanding these wife measures, an unhappy dis-
aster discovered us to the savages, which.was like
to have caused the desolation ot the whole island;
for, after the savages were gone ofF in their canoes,
some of my Spaniard* and i looking abroad, and
being inflamed with a curiosity to see what they
had been doing, to our great amazement, beheld
three savages fall asleep on the ground, who, either
being gorged, could not awake when the others
went off, or having wandered too far into the
woods, did not come back in time.
What to do with them at flrlt we could not
tell; as for slaves, we had enough of them already;
and as to kill them, neither Christianity nor hu-
manity would suffer us to shed the blood of per-
sons who never did us wrong. We perceived they
had no boat left them to transport them to their
own nation; and that by letting them wander
about, they might discover us, and inform the first
savages that should happen to land upon the fame
bloody occasion, which information might entirely
ruin us; and therefore I counselled my Spaniard
to secure them, and set them about some work or
other,' till we could better dispose of them.
Hereupon we all went back, and making them
awake, took them prisoners. It is impossible to
express the horror they were in, especially when
-bound, as thinking they were going to be murder-
ed and eaten, but we soon eased them of their
fear as to that point. We first took them to
the bower where the chief of our country-work
lay, as keeping goats, planting corn, &c. And
then carried them to the two Englishmen's habita-
tion, to help them in their business; but happy it
was for us all," we did not carry them to our cas-
tle, as by the sequel will appear. The English-
men indeed found them work to do 5 but whe-
U tber
ther they did not guard thera strictly, or that they
thought they could not better themselves, I can-
Ttot tell; but certainly one of them rarn away in-
to the woods, and they could not hear of him for
a long time after.
Undoubtedly there was reason enough to sup-
pose he got home in some of the canoes, the sa-
vages returning in about four weeks time, apd
going off in the space of two days. You may be
certain, Sir, this thought could not but terrify
tns exceedingly, and make us justly conclude that
this savage would inform his countrymen of our
abode in the island, how few and weak we were
in comparison to their numbers; and we expected
it would not be long before the Englishmen would
be attacked in their habitations; but the savages
had not seen their places of safety in the woods,
nor our castle, which, it was a great happiness
they did not know.
Nor were we mistaken in our thoughts upon
this occasion; for about, eight months after this,
fix canoes, with about ten men in each canoe,
came sailing by the north side of the island, which
they never were accustomed to before, and land-
ex] about an hour after sun rise, near a mile from
the dwelling of the two Englishmen, who, it seems,
had the good fortune to discover them about a
league off: so that it was an hour before they
could attain the sliore, and some longer time be-
fore they could come at them. And now being
confirmed in this opinion, that they were certain-
ly betrayed, they immediately bound the two slaves
which were left, causing two of the three men,
whom they brought with the women, and who
proved very faithful, to lead thera with their
wives, and other conveniencies, into their retired
cave in the wood, and there to bind the two fel-
lows hand and foot, till they had further orders.
They
They then opened their fences, where they kept
their milk goats, and drove them all out, giving
the goats liberty to ramble in the woods, to make
the savages believe that they were wild ones; but
the slave had given a truer information, which
made them come to the very inclosures. The two
frighted men sent the other slave of the three who
had been with them by accident, to alarm the Spa-
niards, and desire their assistance; in the mean
time, they took their arms and ammunition, and
made to the cave, where they had sent their wives,
and securing their slaves', seated themselves in a
private place, from whence they might-behold all'
the actions of the savages. Nor had they gone
far, when ascending a rising ground, they could
see a little army of Indians approaching to their
beautiful dwelling, and, in a few moments morer
perceive the fame, and their furniture, to their
unspeakable grief, burning in a consuming flame:
and when this was done, they spread here and
there, searching every bulh and place for the peo-
ple, of whom, it is very evident, they had infor-
mation. Upon which the two Englislimen, not
thinking themselves secure where they stood, re-
treated about. half a mile higher in the country,
rightly concluding, that the farther the savages
strolled, there would be lesser numbers together;
upon which they next took their stand by the trunk
of an old tree, very hollow and large^ whence
they resolved to see what would offer: but they
had not stood long there before two savages came
running directly towards them, as though having
knowledge of their being there, who seemed re-
solved to attack them; a little farther were three
more, and Rve more behind them again, all run-
ning the same way. It cannot be imagined what
perpkxity the poor men were in at this sight,,
thirildngj that if assistance did not speedily come,,
-i?? It 2. theirs
their cave in the wood would be discovered, ancf
'consequently all therein lost: so they resolved to
resist them there; and when overpowered, to as-
cend to the top of the trees, where they might
defend themselves as long as their ammunition
pasted, and fell their lives as dear as possible to-
those devouring savages. Thus fixed in their re-
solution, they next considered, whether they should
fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so
take the middle party, by which the two first and
the five last would be separated. In this regula-
tion the two savages also confirmed them, by turn-
ing a little to another part of the Wood; but the
three, and the five after them, came directly to-
wards the tree. Hereupon they resolved to take
them in a direct line, as they approached nearer,
because perhaps the first shot might hit them all
three; and upon this occasion, the man who was-
*to fire, charged his piece with three or four bul-
lets. And thus, while they were waiting, the sa-
vages came on, one of them was the runaway, who
had caused all the mischief: so they resolved he
should not escape, if they both sired at once. But
however, though they did not fire together, they
were ready charged; when the first that let fly/
was too good a marksman to miss his aim; for he
killed the formost outright, the second (who was;
the runaway Indian) fell on the ground, being
shot through the body, but "not dead, and the third}
was a little wounded on the moukjer, who, fitting
down on the ground, fell a screaming in a most
fearful manner. The noise of the gunsr which
not only made the most resounding echoes, from
one Tide to another, but raised the birds of ail
forts, fluttering with the most confused noise, so
much terrified the five savages behind, that they
stood still at first, like so many inanimate images.
But whefi all things were in profound silence, they
caiixe
came to the place where their companions lay:
and these, being not sensible that they were liable
to the same fate, stood over the wounded man,,
undoubtedly inquiring the occasion of this sad ca-
lamity; and 'tis as reasonable to suppose, he told*
them, that it came by thunder and lightning from
the gods, having never seen nor heard of a gun
before^ in the whole course of their lives. By
this time, the Englishmen having loaded their
pieces, fired both together a second time, when
seeing them all fall-immediately upon the ground,
they thought they had killed every creature of *
them: This made them come up boldly before
they had charged their guns, which indeed was a
'wrong step; for when they came to the place,
they found four alive, two of them very little*
wounded, and one not at all, which obliged them
to fall upon them with their muskets: they first
knocked the runaway savage on the head, and a-
nother that was but a little wounded in the arm,,
and then put the other languishing wretches out
of their pain; while he that was not hurt, with
bending knees, and uplifted hands, made piteous,
moans, and signs to them to spare, his life: nor
indeed were they unmerciful to the.poor wretches,,
but pointed to them to sit down at the root of a*
tree hard by; and then one of the. Englishmen,,
with a piece of rope twine he had in his pocket
by mere chance, tying hh two feet together, and-
his two hands behrd him, they left him there,
making all the haste they could after the other
two, fearing they should find out their cave: but
though they could not overtake them, they had 1
the satisfaction to perceive them, at a distance,.
cross a valley towards the sea, a quite contrary
way#to,their retreat; upon which they returned;
ta thectree, to look after their prisoner j but when.:

they came there he was gone, leaving the piecepf
rope-yarn wherewith he was bound behind him.
Well, now they were as much concerned as e-
ver, as not knowing how near their enemies might
be, or in what numbers: immediately they rer
paired to their cave, to fee if all was well therer
aud found every thing safe, except the women,
who were frighted upon their huf.tnn.ds account,
whom now they loved entirely. They had not
been long here, before seven of my Spaniards came
toassist them; while the other ten, their servants,
and Friday's father, were gone to defend their
bower, corn, and cattle, in cafe the savages should'
have rambled so fan ^ There accompanied the se-
ven Spaniards, one of the three savages that had
formerly been taken prisoners; and with them al-
so that very Indian whom the EngHmmen had a
little before left under the tree; for it seems,
they passed by that way where the slaughter was
 made; and so carried along with them that poor
wretch that was left bound. But so many prison-
ers now becoming a burden to u% and fearing the
dreadful consequence of their escaping, moil: of
the Spaniards and English urged the absohite ne-
cessity.there was of killing them for our common,
preservation: but, Sir, the authority I bore as a
governor, over-ruled that piece of cruelty; and
then I ordered them to be sent prisoners to the
old cave in the valley, bound hands and feet, with
two Spaniards to guard them.
So much encouraged were the Englishmen at
the approach of the Spaniards, and so great was
their fury against the savages, for destroying their
habitations, that they had not patience to stay any
longer; but, taking five Spaniards along with
them, armed with four muskets, .a pistol, and a
quarter-staff, away they went in pursuit of their
enemies. As they passed by the place where th&
savages
235
savages were slain, it wa^ very easy to be percei-
ved that more of them had been there, having at-
tempted to carry off their dead bodies, but found
it impracticable, From a rising ground, our party
•had the mortification to fee the smoke that pro-
ceeded from the ruins; when coming farther in
fight of the shore, they plainly perceived that the
savages had embarked hi their canoes, and were
putting out to sea. This they were very sorry
for, there being no coming at them to give them
a parting salute; but, however, they were glad
enough to get clear of such unwelcome guests.
Thus the two honest, but unfortunate English-
men, being ruined a second time, and their im-
provements quire destroyed, most of. my good na-
tured Spaniards helped them to rebuild, and we
all assisted them with needful supplies; nay, what
is more remarkable, their three mischievous coun-
trymen, when they heard its, (which-was after aM
these disasters were over,, they living remote east-*
ward,) very friendly sympathised with them, and
worked for thpm several days: so that in a little
time their habitation was rebuilt, their necessities
supplied, and themselves reilored. to their former
tranquillity
Though the savages had nothing to boast of in
this adventure, (several canoes being driven a-
fhore, followed by two drowned creatures, having,
undoubtedly met with a* stprm at sea that very
night they departed,) yet it was natural to be fup»
posed, that those, whose better fortune it was to
attain their native shore, would inflame their na-
tion to another ruinous attempt, with a greater
force, to carry all before them. And indeed so it
..happened; for, about seven months after, our
iflandb was invaded with a most formidable navyf
no lets than eight and twenty canoes full of sava-
ges,farmed with wooden swords, monstrous clubs,
bows.
bows, and arrows, and such like instruments of
war, landing at the east side of the island. You
may well, Sir, imagine, what consternation our
men were in upon this account, and how speedily
they were- to execute their resolution, having on-
ly that night's time allowed them. '1 hey knew
that since they could not withstand their enemies,
concealment was the only way to procure their
safety: and therefore they took down* the huts
that were built for the two Englishmen, and drove
their flock of goats, together with their own at
the bower, to the old cave in the valley, leaving
as little appearance of inhabitants- as possible; and
then posted themselves w"ith all their force, at the
plantation of the two men. As they expected, so
it happened; for early the next morning, the In-
dians, leaving their canoes at the east end of the
island, came running along the shore, about two
hundred and Hhy in number, as near as could be
guessed. Our army was but little indeed; and:
what was our greatest misfortune, we had not
arms sufficient for them. The account, as to the,;
men, Sir, is,as follows:

besides the fire arms: nay, two of the women, in-
spired with Amazonian fortitude, could not-be
dissuaded from fighting along with their dearest
husbands, and if they died, to die swith them.
Seeing their resolution, we gave them hatchets
likewise,; but what pleased them best, were the
bows and arrows (which they dexterously knew
how to use) that-the Indians had left behind them,
after their memorable battle one against another.
Over this army, which, though little,'was of
great intrepidity, 1 was constituted chief general
and commander; and knowing Will, Atkhis, tho'
exceeding wicked, yet a man of invincible courage,
I gave him the power of commanding under me:
he and six men;, with their muskets loaded, with
lix or seven bullets apiece, were plantedjuit be- .
hind a small thicket of bushes, as an advanced
guard, having orders to let the first pass by; and
then, when he fired into the middle of them, make
a nimble retreat round part of the wood, and so
come in the rear of the Spaniards, who were sha-
ded by a thicket of trees; for though the savages
canie on with the fierceness of lions, yet they
wanted the fubtilty of foxes, being out of all
manner of order, and straggling in heaps every
way: and indeed when Will. Atkins, after fifty
of the savages had passed^by, had ordered three of
his men to give fire, so great was their consterna-
tion, to fee so many men killed and wounded, and
hear such a dreadful noise, and yet not know
whence it came, that they were frightened to the
highest degree; and when the second volley was
given, they concluded no less but that their com-
panions were slain by thunder and lightning from
heaven. In this notion they would have continue
ed, had Will. Atkins and his men retired as soon:
as they sired, according to order; or had the rest
l^een near them, to pour in their inert; continually, .
there
there might have been a complete victory obtain-*
ed; but (laying to load their pieces again, disco-
vered the whole niatter. They were perceived by
some of the scattering savages at a distance, who
let fly their arrows among them, wounded Atkins
himself, and killed his fellow Englishman, and one
of the Indians taken with the women. Our party
did not fail to answer them, and in their retreat
killed, about twenty savages. Here I cannot but
take notice of our poop dying slave, who, though
stopt from his retreat by a fatal arrow, yet with
his staff and hatchet desperately and gallantly as-
sailed the pursuers, and killed five of the savages,
before his life submitted to a multiplicity of wounds.
Nor is the cruelty or malice of the Indians to be
less remarked, in breaking' the arms, legs, and
heads of-the two dead bodies With their clubs and
wooden swdrds, after a most wretched manner.
As Atkins retreated, our party advanced, to in-
terpose between him and the savages; but after
three volleys,, we were obliged to retreat also:
for they were so numerous and desperate, that they .
came up to our very teeth, shot their arrows like,,
;a cloud, and their wounded men, enraged with
cruel pain, fought like madmen. They did not,
however, think fit to follow us," but drawing them-
selves up in a^ circle, they gave two triumphant
ihouts in token of victory, though they had the
grief to fee several of their wounded men bleed to
death before them.
Aster I h^d, Sir, drawn up our little army to-
gether upon a rising ground, Aitkins, wounded as
'In? was, would have had us attack the whole body
of the savages at once. I was extremely well
pleased with the gallantry of the man; but upon
consideration I replied, You perceive. Seignior,
Aitkitis, how their wounded men fight; let them
alone till morning, when they will be faint, stiffs
and sore, and then we /hail have fewer to combat
with. To which, Will. Aiikins, smiling, replied,
That's very true, Seignior, and so J}) all I too; and
thafs the reason I would fight them, now s am warm.
We all answered, Seignior Aitkins, for your part^
you have behaved very gallantly; and if you are
not able to approach the enemy in the morning*
we will fight for you; till then we think it con-
venient to wait; and so we tarried.
By the brightness of the moon that night, we
perceived the savages in great disorder abouwheir
dead and wounded men. This made us change our
resolution, and resolve to fall upon them in the
night, if we could give them one volley undis-
covered. This we had a-fair opportunity to do*
by one of the two Englishmen's leading us rounds
between the woods and the sea-side westwards and
turning short south, came privately to a place
where the thickest'of them were. Unheard and
unperceived, eight of us sired among them, and
did dreadful execution; and in half a minute after,
eight more of us let fly, killing and wounding a-
bundance of them; and then dividing ourselves in-
to three bodies, eight persons in each body, we
marched from among the trees to the very teetli
of the enemy, sending forth the greatest shouts,
and acclamations. The savages hearing a diffe-
rent noise from three quarters at once, stood in
the utmost confusion; but coming in sight of us,
let fly a volley of arrows, which wounded poor
old Friday, yet happily it 'did not prove mortal.
We did not however give them a second opportu-
nity, but rushing in among them, we fired three
several ways, and then fell to work with our
swords^ staves, hatchets, and the butt-end of our
muskets, with a fury not to be relisted; so that,
with the most dismal screaming and howling, they
had recourse to their feet, to save their lives by a
speedy
speedy flight. Nor must we forget the valeur of
the two women; f\;r they exposed themselves to
the greatest dangers, killed many with their ar-
rows, and valiantly destroyed several more with
their hatchets.
In fighting these two battles^ we were so much
tired, that we did not then trouble ourselves to
pursue them to their canoes, in which we thought
they would presently put to the ocean: but there
happening a dreadful storm at sea, which continu-
ing all that night, it not only prevented their
voyage, but dashed several of their boats to pieces
against the beach, and drove the rest so high upon
the shore, that it required infinite pains to get
them off. After our men had taken some relrelh-
mentatid a little repose, they resolved early in
the morning td go towards the place of their land-
ing, ^and fee whether they were gone off, or in
what posture they remained. This necessarily led
them to the place of battle, where several of the
savages were expiring;, a light no way pleasing to
generous minds, to delight in their misery, though
obliged to conquer them by the law of arms: but
our own Indian slaves put them out of their pain,
by dispatching them with their hatchets. At length,
coming in view of the remainder of their army,
we fount! them leaning upon their knees, which
.were bended towards their mouth, a^d the head
between the two hands. Hereupon, coming within
musket-fhot of them, I ordered two pieces to be
fired without ball, in order to alarm them, that we
might plainly know whether they had the courage
to venture another battle, or were utterly dispi-
rited from such an attempt, that so we might ac-
cordingly manage them. And indeed the project:
took very well; for no sooner did the savages hear
the first gun, and perceive the flash of the second,
but they suddenly started upon tjieir feet, in the
'. '. . - greatest
greatest consternation; and when we approached
towards them, they ran yowling and screaming a-
way up the hill into the country. %
- We could rather, at first, have wished, that the
weathei5 had permitted them to have gone off to
the sea; but when we considered that their escape
might occasion the approach of multitudes, to our
utter ruin and dissolution, we were very well
pleased the contrary happened: and. Will. Atkins
(.-who, though wounded, .would not part .from us
all this w"hile) advised us inototo let'ostip this ad-
vantage, but clapping between them and their
boats, deprive them of the capacity of ever re-
turning to-plague the island: J knowr (said he,)
there is but one objeclhn.you can make, which is,
ihat these creatures, living like he cist s'in the }wood9
may make excursions, riffle the plantations, and de-
stroy the taine goats: hut then consider^ we had bet-
ter to do with an hundred men, whom we can kill,
or make staves of, at leisure* than with an hundred
nations, whom it is impossible we stjouldsave our*
selves from, mud) less subduem This advice, and
these arguments being approved of, we set fire to
their boats; and though they were so \vet that
they would not burn entirely, yet we made them
incapable for swimming in the, seas. As soon as
the Indians perceived what \ve were doing, many
of them ran out of the woods, in sight of us, and
kneeling down piteously cried out, Oa, Oa,Wa~
ramakoa, intimating, 1 fuppqse^ that is we would
fetit spare their canoes,, they would never trouble
us again. .; « *
/But all their i complaints,, submissions, and in-
treaties, :\vbrb in Train:'for self-preservation obli-
ging u$ to the contfrrry, we destroyed every one
of them that had ^fc&ped the fury of the ocean.
When the Indians perceived this, they raised* a la-
merit able-cry, and!ran into the woods, where they
X -con-
continued running about, making the woods ring
with their lamentation. Here we should have con-'
sidered, that making these creatures thus desperate,
We 6ught, at the same time, to have set a suffici-
ent1 guard upon the plantations: for the savages,
in their ranging about, found out the bower, de-
stroyed the fences, trod the corn down under their
'feet, and tore up the vines and grapes. It is true,
we were always able to fight these creatures; but
aY they were too swift for us, and very numerous,
we durst not go out single, for fear of them;
though that too was needless, they having no
weapons, nor any materials to make them; and
indeed their extremity appeared in a little time af-
ter. *' - * <*
Though the savages* as already mentioned, had
destroyed our bower, and all our corn, grapes, &c.
yet we had still Jest our stock of cattle in the val-
ley by the cave, with some little corn that grew
there, and the plantation of Will. Aitkins and his
companions, one of whom being killed by an ar-
row, they wdre now reduced to twp: it is re-
markable, that this was the fellow who cut the
poor Indian with his hatchet, and had a design to
murder me* and my countrymen the Spaniards.
As our condition was so low, we came to the re-
solution to drive the savages up to the farther part
of the island, where no Indians landed :~ to kill as
many of them as we could, till we had reduced
their number; and then to give the remainder
some corn to plant, and to teach them how to live8
by their daily labour. Accordingly we pursued
them with our guns, at the hearing of which, they
were so terrified, that they would fall. to the
ground. Every day we killed and wounded some?
of them, ^an^ many we found starved to death, so
that our hearts began to relent at the sight of such
miserable objects. At last, with great difficulty,
,*•*_-' -'' taking
taking one of them alive, and using him with
kindness and tenderness, we brought him to Old
Friday, who talked to him, and told him how
good we would be to them all, giving them corn
and land to plant and live in, and present nourish-
ment, provided they would keep within such bounds
as ihould be allotted them; and not do prejudice to
others: Go thens said he, and inform your country-
men of this; which, if they will not agree to, every
one of them/hall be slain.
The poor creatures, thoroughly humbled, being
reduced to about thirty-seven, joyfully accepted
the offer, and earnestly begged for food; hereup-
on we sent twelve Spaniards and two Englishmen,
welltarmed, together with Old Friday, and three
Indian slaves, who marched to the place where they
were. The slaves were loaded with a large quan-
tity pf bread, and rice cakes, with three live goats:
and the poor Indians being ordered to sit down on
the side of the hill, they ate the victuals Very
thankfully, and have proved faithful to the last,
never trespalfing beyond their bounds, where at
this day they quietly and happily remain, and
where we now and then visit them. They are
confined to a neck of land about a mile and a half
broad, and three or four in length on the south-
east corner of the island, the sea being before, and
lofty mountains behind them, free from the ap-
Eearance of canoes; and indeed their countrymen
ave never made any inquiry after them* We
gave them twelve hatchets, and three or four
knives4 have taught them to build huts, make
wooden spades, plant corn, make bread, breed
tame goats, and milk them, as likewise to majee ,
wickerworks, in which, I must ingenuously con-
fess, they infinitely outdo us, having made them-
selves several pretty necessaries and fancies, as
bafleets^ sieves, bird cages, and cup-boards, as

Thus^ kind Sir, have I given you, according to
my ability, ah impartial account of the various

your departure, to this day; and we have great
reason to acknowledge the kind providence of Hea-

were these people less pleased with those necessary *

they addicted themselves to wickerwork propipted

that when I viewed the. Englishmen's colonies*
they seemed at a distance as though they had lived
like bees in a hive: for Will* Aitkins, who wqs
now become a very industrious and sober man, had
made himself a tent of bajket-work round the out-
side; the walls were worked in as a basket, lit
pannels or strong squares of thirty-two in min>
ber, standing about seven feet high: in the mid*
die was another, not above twenty paces round*
but much stronger built, being of an octagonal
form, and in the eight corners stood eight strong
posts, round the top of which he laid strong pieces,
pinned with wooden pips, from which he raised a
pyramid for the roof, mighty pretty, I assure you,,
and joined very well together with ir6n spikes,
which he made himself;, for he had made him a
forge, with a pair of wooden bellows and char-
coal fur his workr forming an anvil out ©f one of
the iron-crows, to work upon, and in this manner
would he make himself hooks, staples, spikes, bolts,/
and hinges. After he had pitched the roof* of his
innermost tent, he made it so firm between the
rafters with basket-work, thatching that over a-
gain with rice straw, and over that a large leaf of
a tree, that liis house was as dry as if it had been
tiled or fiated. The outer circuit was covered as
a lean-to quite round this inner apartment,, laying,
long rafters from the thirty-two-.angles, to the*
top-posts of the inner house, about twenty feet
distance: so that there was a space like a wa41 be-
twixt the outer and inner wall, near twenty feet
in breadth. The inner place he partitioned ostT
with the fame wicker-work, dividing it into fo£
neat apartments^ every one of which haa1 .a door,

into the space and walk that was round it, riot on-

was 'a passage directly to the door of the inner
house; on either side was a wicker partition, and
a door, by which you go first into a large room
twenty-two feet wide, and about thirty long, and
through that into another of a smaller length, so
that in the outward circle were ten handsome
rooms, fix of which werepnly to be come at thro*
the apartments of the inner tent, serving as re-
tiring rooms .to the respective chambers of the
inner circle, and four large warehouses, which
went in through one another, two on either hand
of the passage that led through the outward door
to the inner tent* In short, nqthing could be built
more ingeniously, kept more neat, or have better
conveniencies; and hdre lived the three families,
Will. Aickins, his companion, their wives anct
children, and the widow of the deceased As to*
religion, the men seldom taught their wives the-
knowledge of God; any more than the sailors
custom of swearing by his name. The greatest,
improvement their wives had, was, they taught
them to speak English, so as to be understood.
None of their children were then above six years,
old; they were all fruitful enough; and, I thinks
the cook's maters wife was big of her sixth child.
When I inqirred- of the Spaniards about their-
circumstances while among the savages, they told
iiie, that they abandoned themselves to defpahy
reckoning'thenisdves a poor and miserable people,,
that had no mean put into their hands, and conse-
quently must soon be starved to death* They
owned, however, that they were in the wrong to<
think so, and for refusing the assistance that reason,:
offered^or their support, as well as future deli-?
veranc^ f cons effing that grief was a most insigni-
ficant passion, as it looked upon things as without
i*emedy, and having no hope of good things to>

Nor did his-remarks,end herej sow making oB*
servations upon my improvements, and on my
condition at first, infinite y worse than theirs, he
told ,tne, that Englishmen had, in their distress^
greater presence of mind than those of any other
.country that he had met with; and that they anc}
the Portuguese were the worst men in the world
to struggle under misfortunes. When they landed
among the savages, tney found but little provision^
except they would turn cannibuls, there being hut
a few roots and herbs., with little substance tta
them, and of which the natives gave them bup
very sparingly. Many were the ways they took
to civilize and teach the savages, but in vain 2.
for they would not own them to be their instruc-
tors, whose lives were owing to their bounty..
Their extremities were very great,, many days,
^beings entirely without* food,, the savages there
Being more indolent and lei's devouring than those
who had better suppliers. When thdiy went.out tp
battle, they were obliged to assist these people,; in
one of which my faithful Spaniard being taken,,
had like to have been devoured. They had lost
their amurution, which rendered their firearm^
useless; nor could they use the bows and arrowy
that were given them, so that while wbe armies
were at a distance, they had Ho* chance,, but when*
close, then they could be of service with halberts
aiid iharpened sticks, put into the muzzles of their
OTufketQ. They made themselves targets of wood,,
covered with the ikins of wild beasts; and when
one happened to ke knocked down, the rest of the.
company fought over him till he recovered; and
then standing close, ,in a line, they would make
: their way through a thousand savages*. At th,et
". return
return of their friend, who they thought had been
entombed in the bowels of their enemies, their
joy was inconceivable. Nor were they less sur-
prised at the light of the loaves of bread I had
sent them, things that they had not seen for seve-
ral years, at the fame time crossing and blessing it,
as though it wa& manna sent* from heaven: but
when they knew the errand, and perceived the
boat which was to carry them to the person and
place from whence such relief came, this struck
them with such a surprise of joy as made some of
them faint away, and others burst out into tears.
This was the summary account that 1 had frpm
them. I shall now inform the reader what I next
did for them, and in what condition I left them.
As we were all of opinion that the savages would
scarce trouble them any more, so we had 1 a appre-
hensions on that score. I told them I was come
purely to establish, and riot to remove them; andr
upon that occasion, had not only -brought then*
necessaries for convenience and defence, but also*
artificers, and other persons, both for their ne-
cessary employments, and to add to their number*.
They were all together when I thus talked to
them; and before I delivered to them the stores I
had brought, I asked them one by one, if they had
entirely forgot their first animosities,, would en-
gage in the strictest friendship, and shake hands^
with one another? On this, Will, Atkins, with:
abundance of good humour, said, they had afflic-
tions enough to make them all sober, and enemies
enough to make them all friends: as for himselfr
he would live and die among them, owning, that
what the Spaniards had done to him, his own mad
humour had made necesiary for them to do. Nor
had the Spaniards occasion tojustify their proceed-
ing to me; but they told me, that, since Will. At-
kins had behaved himself so viliantly in sights and
at
at other times (hewed such a regard to the common
interest of them all, they had not only forgotten,
all that was past, but thought he ought as much
to be trusted with arms and necessaries as any of
them, which they testified by making him next in
command to the governor: and they most heartily
embraced the occasion of giving me this solemn
asturance, that they would never separate their
interest again as long as they lived.
After these kind declarations of friendship, we
appointed all of us to dine together the next day;
upon this I caused the ship's cook and his mate
come on shore for that purpose, to assist in dressing
our dinner. We brought from the ship six pjecesi
of beef, and four of pork, together with our:
punch-bowl, and materials to fill it; and .in par-
ticular, I gave them ten bottles of French claret,-
and ten pf English beer, which was very accept
table to them. The Spaniards added to our feasti
five whple kids, which being roasted, three of them;
w<b?e sent as fresh meat to the sailors on board,,
and the other two we atfe ourselves*. After oim
merry and innocent feast was over, I began tot
distribute my eargoe among them. First, I gave!
them linen sufficient :to make every one of thenu
foui: shirts, and at the Spaniards request made
them up six. „ The thin English stuffs I allotted to^
make every one a light coat like a frock agreeable?
to the qlhnatt, -and left them such a quantity, as
to make more upon their decay; as also pumps*-
shoes, hats, and stockings. It is not to be ex*i
pressed the pleasing satisfaction which fat upon the?
countenances of these poor men, when they per-;
chived what care I took of them, as if I had been;?
a common father to them .all; and they all enga-t
ged never to leave the island, till I ga*vel my con*;
lent for their departure. I then presented to themi
the people I .brought,, to-wit, the tailor, smiths
and;
and the two carpenters ; but my Jack of all trades
was the most acceptable present I could make
them* My tailor fell immediately to work, and
made every one of them a shirt; after which, he
learned the women -how to sew and stitch, there-
by to become the more helpful to their husbands,
Kfeither were1 the carpenters less useful, taking in
pieces their clumsy things, instead of which they
made convenient and handsome tables, stools, bed-
steads, cupboards, lockers and shelves. But when
I carried them to fee Will. Atkin's basket-house,
they owned they never saw such a piece of natu-
ral ingenuity before; I am sure, said one of the
carpenters, the man thatbuUt this has no need of
us i you need, S/r, do nothing, but give himJools*
I divided the tools among them in this manner:
to every man I gave a digging-spade, a shovel, and -
a rake, as having no harrows or ploughs; and to
every separate place a pick-axe, a crow, a broad
axe, and a saw, with a store for a general supply,
should any be broken or worn out. I left them
also nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisseb, knives^
scissars, and all forts of tools and iron work; and
for the use of the smith, gave them three tons of
un wrought iron for a supply: and as. to arms and
amunition, I stored them even to profusion, or at
least to equip a Efficient little army against all
opposers whatsoever. *
The young man (whose mother was unfortu-
nately starved to death,) together with the maid, a
pious and well educated young woman, seeing
things so well ordered on shore (for I made them
accompany me,) and considering they had no oc-
casion to go so far a voyage as to the East Indies,
they both desired of me, that 1 would leave'them
there, and enter them among my subjects. This I
readily agreed to, ordering them a plat of grounds
tii which were three, little houses erected, environ-
ed
ed with basket-work, pallisadoed like Atkins', and
adjoining to his plantation. So contrived were
their tents, that each of them had a room apart to
lodge in, while the middle tent was not only their
storehouse, but their place for eating and drinking.
At this time the two Englishmen removed their ha-
bitation to their former place; To that now the
island was divided into three colonies;firft, Those
1 have just now mentioned, secondly, That of Will.
Aitkins, where there were four families of Eng«*
lifhmen, with their wives and children, the widow
and her children: the young man, and the maid,
who, by the way we made a wife of before our.
departure; three savages, who were slaves; the
taylor, smith, (who served also as a gunsmith,)
and my other celebrated person called Jack of all
trades. Thirdly % My chief colony, which consist-
ed of the Spaniards, with Old Friday, who still
remained at my old habitation, which was my ca-
pital city: and surely never was there such a me-
tropolis, it now being hid in so obscure a grove,
that a thousand men might have, ranged the island
a month, and looked purposely for it, without be-
ing able to find it, though the Spaniards had en-
larged its boundaries, both without and within,
in a most surprising manner.
But now 1 think it high time to speak of. the
young French priest of the order of St. Benediciy
whose judicious and pious discourses, upon sundry
occasions, merit an extraordinary observation:
nor can his being- a French Papist priest, I pre-
sume, give offence to any of my readers, when
they have this assurance from me, that he was a
person of the most courteous disposition, exten-
sive charity, and exalted piety. His arguments
were always agreeable to reason, and his!conver-
sation the most acceptable of any person that I
had ever yet met with inr my life.
Sir,
-Sir, said he to me one day, finee under God (at
the fame time crofllng.his breast) you have not only
saved my life, but, by permitting me to go this voy-
age, have granted me the happiness of free conver-
sation, I think it'my duty, as my profession obliges
me, to save what fouls I can, by bringing ihetn to
the knowledge of some Catholic doctrine,-necessary
to salvation; and since these people are under your
Immediate government, in gratitude, justice, and
deceny for what you have done for me, I offer no
farther points- in religion, than what shall merit
your approbation. Being pleased with the modesty
of his carriage, I told him he should not be the
worse used for being of a different persuasion, if,*
upon that very account, we did not differ in points'
6f faith, not decent in a part of the country,
where the poor Indians ought to be instructed in
the knowledge of the true God and his Soil Jesus^
Christ. To this he replied, that conversation
might easily be separated from disputes? that he
would discourse with me rather as a gentleman,
than a religious: but that if.he did enter upon re-
ligious arguments, upon my desiring the fame, I
would give him liberty to defend my own princi*-
pies. He farther added, that he would "do all that
became him in his office, as a priest as well as a
Christian, tp procure the happiness of all that was
in the ship: that though he could not pray with,-
he would pray for us, on all occasions: and then
behold me several extraordinary events of his life,
within a few years past, but particularly in this-
last, which was the most remarkable: that in this
voyage he had the misfortune to be five times ship-
ped and unshipped: his first design Was to have
gone to Marftinico, for which taking ship at St.
Maio, he was forced into Lisbon by bud weather,
the vessel running aground in the mouth of the
Tagus: that from thence he went ou board a For*
, . tuguelp
tugueselhip, Bound to the Maderas, whose master
<being but an indifferent mariner, arid out of his
reckoning, they were drove to Fial, v^hefe felling;
their commodity, which was corn, they resolved
to take in their loading at the iste of May, and to
sail to Newfoundland 5 at the banks of which,
meeting a French ship bound to Quebec, in the
fiver of Canada, and from, thence to Martinico j
in this ship he embarked, the master of which dy-
ing at Quebec, that Voyage was suspended r and
lastly, shipping Himself for France, this last ship
was destroyed by fire, as before has been related.
* At this time we talked no further : but another
morning he comes to me, just as I \vas going to
visit the ,Englislimen's colony, and tells me, that
as he knew the prosperity, of the island was my
principal desire, he had something to communicate,
kgreeable to my design, by which perhaps he might
put it, more than he yet thought it was, in the
way of the benediction of Heaven. How, Sir?
said I, in a surprise, are we not yet in the way*
of God's Messing, after all these signal providences
and deliverances, of which' you have had such au
ample relation? He replied/l hope, Sir, you are
hi the way, and that your good design will pros-
per: but still there qre some among you that are
hot equally right in their actions: and remember,
I beseech you, Sir, that Achan, by his crime, re-
moved God's blessing from the camp of the chil-
dren of Israel; that though six and thirty were
entirely innocent, yet they became the objects of
divine vengeance, and boxe the weight of the pu-
nifhment accordingly, / . /
* So sensible was I touched with this discourse, and
so satisfied with that ardent piety that, inflamed his
foul, that I desired him to accompany-me to the .
Englishmen's plantations, which he was very glad
6f> by reafdn these'were the subjects of what he
Y desigued
designed to discourse with me about; and while
we walked oh together, he began in the following
mariner:
Sir, said he, I must confess it is a great unhap-
piness that we (disagree in fey era] doctrinal articles
of religion ; but surely both of us acknowledge
this, that there is a God, who having given us
some stated rules for our service and obedience,
we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend
him, either by neglecting what he has command-
ed, or by doing what he has forbidden us. This
truth every Christian owns, that whenever any
one presumptuously fins against God's command,
the Almighty then withdraws his blessing from him;
every good man therefore,ought cerrainly to pre-
vent such neglect of, or sin against God andsiis
commands. I thanked the young priest for ex-
pressing so great a concern for us, and desired him
to explain the particulars of what he had obser-
ved, that, according to the parable of Achan, I
might remove the accursed thing from among us.
Why then, Sir, said he, in the first place, you
liavfe four Englishmen, who have taken savage
women to their wives, by whom they have several
children, though none of them are legally mar-
ried, as the law of God and man requires; they,
>I fay, Sir^are no less than adulterers, and as they
still live in adultery,, are liable to the curse of
God. I know, Sir, you may object the want of a
priest, or clergyman of any kind; as also, pen,
ink, and paper, to write down a contract of mar-
riage, and have it signed between them. But nei-
ther this, nor What the Spanish governor has told
you of their chusing by consent, canbe reckoned
a marriage, nor any more than an agreement to
keep them from quarrelling among themselves;
for, Sir, the essence cr sacrament of matrimony
(so he galled it) not only consists in mutual con-
sent,
sent, but in the legal obligation which compels
them to own and acknowledge one anpther to
abstain from other persons, the men to provide
for their wives and children, and the women to
the fame an^ like conditions, mutatis mutandis on
their side: whereas, Sir, these men, upon their
own pleasure, on any occasion, may forsake those
women, and marry others, and by disowning their
children suffer them utterly to perish. Now, Sir,
added he, can God be honoured in such an unlaw-
ful liberty^ this? how can a blessing succeed the
best endeavours, if men are allowed to live~ in so
licentious a way? 1 was indeed struck with the
thing myself, and though that they were much to
blame, that no formal contract had been made,
though it had been but breaking a stick between
them, to engage them to live as man and wife,
never to separate; but love, cherish, and comfort
one another all their lives? yet, Sir, said I, when
they took these women, I was not here; and if it
is adultery, it is past my remedy, and I cannot
/help'it.' True, Sir, answered the young priest, you
cannot be charged n&ith that^paft if the crime which
was done in your absence; but1beseech you, don't
flatter your/elf, that you are tinder n6 obligation
now to put a period to it; which, if you negleSl t&
do, guilt will be entirely on you alone^ since it is
certainly in nobody's power but. yours to alter their
condition. I must confess, I was so dull, that I
thought he meant I should part them, and know-
ing that this would put the whole island in. consu-
sion, I told him I could not consent to it upon any
account whatsoever. Sir, said he, in a great sur-
. prise, I do not mean that you should separate, bus
marry them, by a written contrast, signed by both
man and woman, and by all the witnesses presents
which all the European laws decree to be of suffix
cient efficacy. Amazed with such true piety and
Y 2 since-
sincerity, and considering tlja validity of a'writ*
ten contract, 1, acknowledged all tha$he said to-
be Very j,ustfand kind 5 and that I would discourse
with the men about it; neither could 1 see what
reason they could have not to let him marry them,
whose authority in that affair, is owned to be as
authentic, as if they were married by any of our
clergymen in England,
, The next complairit he had to make to me, was
this; that though these English subjects of mine
had lived with these women seven years, and tho^
they were of good understanding, and capable of
instruction, having learned not only to. speak, bus
to read English, yet all this while they had never-
taught them any thing of the Christian religion;
or the knowledge, of God, much less in what man-
ner he ought to be served. And is not this an un7
accountable neglecl? said he, warmly. Depend upon
it, God Almighty will call them to account for such
contempt. And though I am not of your religion^
yet I should be glad to see these people released fron\
the devlfs power*, and he saved by the principles of
theChristian^ejtgionytl^' knowledge $fyGpd, of a,
Redeemer,, the resurne&ion, and of a future state.
But as it Is not Uo% la\e^ if you please togiyemv

fly tins great des ecl^ by bringing' them into the

. v I covtld hold no longer, bilt embracing him^
told him, with a thousand thanks, I would grant
whatever he requested,; and desired him to proceed
in the third atticley whidh he did in the following
jnanner;

into Persia, India, and China, men who are wil-
ling to die for the sake of God and the Christian
faith, in order to bring poor infidels into the way
of salvation. Now, Sir, as here is an opportu-
nity to convert seven and thirty poor savages, I
wonder how you can pass by such an occasion of
doing good, which is- really worth the expence of
a man's whole life.
I must confess I was so confounded at this difc
course, that I could not tell how to answer him.
Sit, Jat^ nei seeing me in disorder, IJball be very
firry if I have given you offence, No^ Sir, said Ir
I am rather confounded,; and you know my cir-
cumstances, that being bound to the East Indies in
a merchant ship, I cannot wrong the owners so
much, as to detain the ship here, the men lying,
on victuals and wages on their account. If I stay
above "twelve days, I must pay 31. Sterling per
diem demurrage, nor must the; ship stay above-
eight d,jys more; so that I am unable to engage
in this work, imleiVI would leave the ship, and
be reduced to my former condition. The priest,
though he owned this was hard upon me, yet laid
it to my conscience, whe her .the blessing orsaving
seven and thirty souls was not worth venturing,
all that I had in the world? Sir, said I, it is very
true 1 but as you are an ecclesiastic, it naturally
fails into your profession:. why therefore don't
you rather offer to undertake it yourself, than
press me to it? Upon this he turned about, ma- ,
king a very low bow, I most humbly thank God
and you, Sir, said he, for so blessed a call; and
most willingly undertake so glorious an office,
which will sufficiently compensate all the hazards,
and difficulties I have gone, through in a long and
uncomfortable voyage.
While be was thus speaking, I coulB discover ai
rapture in, his fate; by his colour goings and go*

ming: at thte.same time hi& eyes sparkled like fire,
with all the signs of the most jealous transports.
And when I aft ed whether he was in earnest; Sis,
said he, it was to preach to thejndians, I consent-
ed to come along with you; these infidels, even
in this little island, are infinitely of rrore worth
than my poor life: if sothat I should prove the ">
Happy instrument of saving these poor-creatures
spuls, I care not if 1 never fee nfy native country
again. One thing I only beg of you iiicfre^ is, that^
you would leave Friday with me, to be my inter-'.
preter, without whose assistance neither of us will*
understand each other.
This request very sensibly troubled me, firsts
upon Fridays being bred a protestant, and second-
Ivy for the affection I bos e to him for his fidelity;
hut Immediately the remembrance of Friday's fa- >
ther coming into my head, I recommended him t&
him as having learned Spanish, which the priest
also undrestood, and* so was thorcugly satisfied •
v/ith him.
When we came to the Englishmen, after I had
told them what necessary things I had done for
them, stalked to them of the scandalous life they
led, told them what notice the clergyman had ta-
ken of it, and asked thdm if they were married
men or batchelors? They answered, two of them i
were widowers, and the other three single men.
But, said I, with what conscience can you call i
these your wives, by whom you 'have so many
"children, and yet are not lawfully married? They
all said, that they took them before the governor <
as such, having nobody else to marry them, which *
they thought as legal as if they had had a parson*'
No doubt, said I, but in the eye of God you are:
so: but unless I am assured of your honest inten-
tion never td desert these poor creatures, lean
do nothing more for you> neither can you expect-
God s
. God's blessing while youlive in sucbah open course'
of adultery. Hereupon Will Atkins, who spoke?
for the rest, told ine, That they believed" theirs
wives the most innocent a-d virtuous creatures-
in the world ^ that they would never forsake them5
while they had breath: and that if there was a'
clergyhian in the ship; they would be married to'
them with all their heart. .1 told you before, said!
I, .that I have *a minister with me, who shall mar-
ry you to-morrow morning, if you are willing;
so I would have you consult to-night, with the*
rest about it. I told him, the clergyman was a*
Frenchman; and knew not a word of English, but1
that I would act as a clerk between them. Anth
indeed this business met with such speedy success,"
that they all told me* in a few minutes after, that"
they were ready to be formslty married as soon"
as I pleased; with which informing the priest, he*
was exceedingly rejoiced.
Nothing now remained, but that the women*
should be made sensible of the meaning of the*
thfngr; with which being well,satisfied, they withr
their husbands attended at my apartment the next
morning: there was my priest, habited in a black
vest, something like a cassoc with a sash round it,^
ximch resembling a minister, and I was his inter-
preter. But the seriousness of his behaviour, and1
the scruples he made of marrying the women, who
were not baptized, gavethem an exceeding reve-
rence for his person: nor indeed would he marry
them at all, till he obtained my liberty to dis->
course both wash the men and women, atfd then/;
lie told them, That in the sight of all indifferent;
men, and in the sense of the laws of society, they
had lived in open adultery, which nothing now
but' their consent to marry* or final separation^
could .put an "end to ;<and' even here was a difficult
ty with xespect to the laws of Christian matinmo-i
ny, in marrying a professed Christian to a hea-
then idolater, unbaptized; but yet there was time
enough to make them profess the name of Christ,
without which nothing could be done: that, be-
sides, he believed themselves very indifferent Chri-
stians; and consequently had not discoursed with
their wives upon that subject; and that unless they
promised him to do so, he could not marry them,
as being expressly forbidden by the laws of God.
All this they heard attentively, and owned rea-
dily, But, Lord, Sir I said Will Atkins to me,
how stoould we teach them religion, who know no-
thing of it ourselves? How can we talk to our wives
of God, Jesus Christ, heaven and hell? why, they
would only laugh at us, who never yet have prac-
tised religion, but on the contrary, all manner of
"wickedness. Will Atkins, said 1, cannot you tell;
your wife, she is in the wrong, and that her-gods
are idols, which can neither hear, speak, nor un-
derstand; but that our God, who has made, can
destroy all things; that he rewards the good, and:
punishes the wicked;.and at last will bring us to*,
judgment.? cannot you tell her these things ?.
That's true, said Atkins, but then she'll tell me,
it is utterly false, since I am not puni/hed and*
sent to -the devil, who hath been such a wicked
creature. These words I interpreted to the priest I
O! said he, tell him, his repentance will make
him a very good minister to his spouse, and qua*-
lify him to preach on the mercy and long-suffering,,
of a merciful Being, who delires not the death of
a sinner, and even defers damnation to the last
judgment; this will lead him to the above doc-
trine, and will make him an excellent preacher to
his wife. I repeated this to Atkins, who, being;
more than ordinarily affected with it, replied, I
know all this,- Sir, and a great deal more; but
how can I have the impudence to talk thus to my
wife* when my conscience witnesses against me?
ALAS! said he, (with tears in hU eyes and gi-
ving a great sigh,) as for repenting* that is for
ever past me. Past you! Atkins, said I, what do
you mean? You know, well enough, said he> what
I nrean; / mean it is too late.;
; When I told the priest what he said, the poor
affectionate man could not refrain from weepings
, but recovering himself, Pray, Sir, said he, ask
him if he is contented that it is too late; or is he.

fion, How can I be easy in a slate .which I know

every word the priest had said, who then: parted
from jis to talk to his .wife* while we discoursed
with the rest. But these were, very stupid in re-*
ligious matters, yet * all of them promised to do
their endeavours to make their wives turn Chri-
stians; dnd upon which promises the priest marri-
ed'thefthree couple. But as Aitkins. was the on-
Jy sincere convert, and of more fense than the
rptty my clergyman was earnestly Inquiring after*
him: SiVyfaid he, let us walk out of this iaby-s
rinth, and X dare fay we shall find^ this poqr man
preathing to his wife already. And indeed w6
found it^i'ue; for coming to the edge of the vvood^
we perceived Aitkins and his saVage whVsittihg
under the lhaide of a bush, in very .earnest'dis-
•> ~ '' '* course*
course: he pointed to the sun, to the quarters of
the earth, to himself, to her, the woods, and the
trees. Immediately we could perceive him star|
upon his feet, fall down upon his knees, and lift
up both his hands; at which the tears ran down
my clergyman's cheeks; but our great misfor-
tune was, we could not hear one word that pas-
sed between them. Another time he would em-
brace her, wiping the tears from her eyes, kissing
her with the greatest transports, and then both
kneel down for some minutes together. Such rap-
tures of joy did this occasion in my young priest,
that he could scarcely contain himself: And a lit-
tle after this, we observed by her motion, a3 fre-
quently lifting up her hands, and laying them on
her breast, t;hat she was mightily affected with his
discourse, and so they withdrew from our sight*
When we came back, we found them both wait-
ing to be called in; upon which we agreed to ex-
amine him alone, and so I began thus to discourse
him. Prithee, Will. Aitkins, said I, what educa*
tiori had you, What was your father?
JVJ A, A better man than ever I shall be; he
was, Sir, a clergyman, who gave me goodinstruc-
tion, or correction, which I despised like a brute,
as I was, and murdered my poor father.
Pr. Ha! a murderer!
[Here the priest started and looked sale, as
thinking he had really killed his fathers
K. C. What, did you kill him with your hands?
IF. A, No, Sir, I cut not his throat, but broke
his heart, by the most unnatural turn of disobe-
dience to the tenderest and best of fathers.
K C: Well, I pray God grant you repentance j
I did not ask you to extort a confession; but I
asked you, because I see you have more knowledge
of what is good than your companions.
W* A. O, §ir, whenever I look back upon my.
past
past life, conscience upbraids me with my father*
the sins against our parents make the .deepest
wounds, and their weight lyes the heaviest upon
the mind. *
R. C. You talk, Will, too feelingly and sensibly
for me; I am not able to bear it.
JV. A. You bear it, Sir! you know nothing of
,it.
R* C. But yes, Aitkins, I do; and every shore,
-valley, and tree in this island, witness the anguish
tof my foul for my undutifulness to my kind -fa-
ther, whom I have murdered likewise: yet my re-
pentance falls infinitely short of yours. But,
Will, how comes the fense of this matter to touch
you just now? . •* •
z IV. A. Sir, the work you have set me about has
occasioned it i for talking to my wife about God
and religion, she has preached me such a sermon
that I shall retain it in lasting remembrance.
* K* C No, no, it is your own moving pious ar-
guments to her, has made conscience fling them
back upon you. But pray, Aitkins, inform us
what passed between you and your wife, and in
what manner did you begin. *
W. A: I talked to her of the laws of marri-age,
the reason of such compacts, whereby order and
justice Is maintained; without which men would
run from their wives and children, to the dissolu-
tion of families or inheritances.
R. C. Well, and what did she fay to all this?
W. A. Sir, we began our discourse in the fol-
lowing manner, which I shall exactly repeat ac-
cording to my mean capacity, if you think it worth
your while to honour it with your attention.

W. A. My dear, God is in. heaven, which he
made; he ajso made the earth, the sea, and all that
is therein.
Wife. Why you not tell me much long ago?
W. A. My dear, i" have been a wicked wretch,
having a long time'lived without the knowledge)
of God in the world. •
Wist. What, not know great God in own na-
tion; No no good ting? No fay O to him? that's
strange! * • *
W. A. But, my dear, many live as if there was
no God in heaven for all that.
Wife. Why God suffer this? why makee not

W. A. It is our own faults, child. •*
Wife. But, if he much great, can makee kill,
why no makee kill when to serve him? No be
good mans no cry O to him?

Wife. Did not you tell God tankee for that?
r W. A. No, I have neither thanked: him for his*
mercy, nor feared him for his power.:
Wife. Then me not believe your God be good,
nor makee kill, when you makee him angry.
W. A. Alas! must my wicked life hinder you
from believing in him?

Wife, Where then makee power strong, when
ht hears you curse, swear de great damn?
W. A. My £ear this shews he is indeed a God
and not a man,* who has such tender mercy?
Wife. Mercy! \\;ha;t dp you call mercy?
e W. A. Be pitied and spares', us: as he is ou,r
great Creator, so is he a lit) our tender father.
Wife. So God never angry, never kill wicked,

ment and vengeance.

course thus.)

Wife. When did he bid you pray? What, do you

W» A No my dear, but God has spoken former-

book.
Wife. O where dat goodbpok?
W. A. I have it not now by me: but one time
or other I shall get it for you to read. 7hen he em-
braced her with great ajffeclion.
Wife. Pray tell a mee did God teachee them write
that book? -
W. A, Yes, and by thatrrule we know him to
be God.
Wife. What way, what rule you know him?
W. A. Because he teaches what is good, just,,
and holy; and forbids all wicked and abominable
actions that incur4 his displeasure,
Wife. O me fain understand that, and if he do
all things you fay he do, surely he hear me say O
to him 5 lie makee me good if I,wish to be good;
he no kill me if I love him; me tink,( believe him

Here the poor man fell upm his knees, and made
her kneel down by him, praying with the greatest
fervency,
fervendyf shut' God would inflrucl her by his Holy
Spirit: and that God by his proVidencr would fend
them a Bible for both their inftru&ions* An J such
was the early piety of this new convert, that/he
made him promise never to forsake God any more,
hst, being made dead as Jhe called it, Jhe jhould
Hot only want her inflruclor, but himself be misera-
ble in a long eternity.
Such surprising accotint as this 'Ws, proved
very affecting to us both, but particularly to the
young clergyman, who was mightily concerned he
could not talk to her himself. Sir, said he, there
is something more to be done to this woman than
tbinarry her i I mean, that me ought to be bap-
tized* To this I presently agreed': Pray, said he;
a|;ain^ ask h^r husband, whether he has ever talk-
ed to her of Jesus Christ, the salvation os sinnersj
the nature of faith, and redemption in and by him,
of the Holy Spirit; the resurrection, last judge-
nient, and a suture state; but the poor fellow
melted into tears at this question* saying, that he
had said something to her of these things, but his
inability to talk of them,, made him afraid lest
her knowledge of them should rather make her
contemn religion, than be benefited by it: but
that if I would discourse with her, it would be
very evident my labour would not be in vain. Ac-
cOrdingly Icalled her in, and placing myself as in-
terpreter between the religious priest and the Wo-
man, 1 intreated him to go on: but surely never
was such a sermon preached by any clergyman in
these latter days, with so much zeal, knowledge,
and sincerity~ts in ihort, he brought the woman to
embrace the knowledge of Christ, and of redemp-
tion'by him, with so surprising a degree of under-
standing, that she made it her own request to be
baptized,
He then performed his office in the sacrament

of baptism^ firsts by; saying .some \yprds_ overttO
himself in Latin, ami then asked me to give her at*
xiame^ as being her godfather ^ and pouring a whole,
dish full of water upon the woman's head, he said
MARY, I baptize thee in the name of the Father,:
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost j so that*
none could know os what religion he was, After*
ibis he pronounced the benediction, in Latin.. Thus,
the woman being made a Christian, he married
her to Will.' Atkins; which being, finimed, he af£y
fectionately exhorted him to lead a holy life for *
the future; that since the Almighty, by the con<->
victions of his conscience, had honoured him toj
be the instrument of hi§ wife's conversion, he;
should not dislioqour the grace of pod* that wihjl&r
the savage was converted,, the instrument should^
be cast away. Thus ended a ceremony, to me>
the most pleasant and agreeable I Sever passed hit
my life. f }
The affairs of the island being settled, I was;
preparing to go> on board, when the young man?
(whose mother was staryed) came to 3ne,- faying, j
thai as he understood I had a? clergyman with irte^;
who had married the Englishmen with lavagejs, [
he had a match to, make between two Christians,»
which he desired might be finished before I de£art-f;
ed. /Thinking that it was he himself that had/
courted his mother's maid, I persuaded him not tq^
do any thing rashly upon the account of his soli-?
tary circumstances;. that the n^aid was an unequal-
match for him, both in respect to substance apd
years; and that it was very probable he would,
live to return to his own country, where he might .
have a far better choice. At these words, smiling, .
he interrupted me, thanking me for my good .ad-
vice; that as he had nothing to beg of .me, but a
small settlement, with a servant or two, or some
few necessaries; so he hope'd'I would; not be un-
mindful
mindful of him when I returned to England, but
give his letters to his friends; and that when he
was redeemed, the plantation and all its improve-
ments, however valuable, should be returned to
me again. Bus as for the marriage be proposed,
that it was not himself, but that it was between
my Jack of all trades, and the maid Susan, -
] I was indeed agreeably surprised at the mention-
ing this match, which seemed very suitable, the
one being a very ingenious fellow, and .the other
-*h excellent, dexterous, and sensible housewife,
fit to be governess of the whole island : so we mar»
ried them the same day; and as I was her father,
and gave her away, so I gave her a handsome por-
tion, appointing her and her husband a convenient
large space of ground for their plantation. The
sharing out of the land I left to Will. Atkins, who
really divided it very justly to every person's sa-
tisfaction: they only desired one general writing
under my hand for the whole, which I caused to
*;be drawn up, signed, and sealed to them, setting
out their bounds, and giving them a right to the
whole possession of their respective plantations,
- with their improvements, to them and their heirs,
reserving all the rest of the island as my owfl pro-
perty, and a certain rent for every particular
plantation aft6r eleven years. As to their laws and
government, 1 exhorted them to love one another:
and as to the Indians who lived in a nook by them-
selves, I allotted three or four of them planta-
tions, and the rest willingly chose to become ser-
vants^ to the other families, by which means they
were employed in useful labour, and fared much
better than they did before Besides, the savages
being thus mixed with the Christians, the work of
their conversion might be set on foot by the latter,
in the clergyman's absence, to our equal satisfac-
tior. The young priest, however, was a littlfc
Z 3 >  / anxi0USl
anxious lest the< ehriltiatls fliould not be swilling
to do their pai*ts in instructing those poor Indians:;
I therefore told him, we fh.ould call them all toge-
ther; that he should speak to the Spaniards who
were Papists^ and I to the English who were Pro-?
testants, and make them promise that they .would
never make any distinction in religion, but teacfy.
the general true knowledge os God, and his sop
Jesus Christ, in order to convert the poor sava-
ges: and this indeed they all promised us accord*
When I came to Will Atkin's house, I found!
his bapti^d wife, and the young woman newly
married tq iny Jack of all trades, were become
great intimates, and discoursing of religion toger
the-r. O Sir, says. Will. Atkins, when God ha$
sinners to reconcile to himself, he never wants an
instructor: I knew I was unworthy fdr so good a
work, and therefore this young woman has been
sent hither as it were from heaven, Who is suffi-
cient:to convert a whole island of savages. The
young woman blushed, arid was: going td rife; bti%
I desired her to sit still, and'hoped that God vVduld
bless her in so gooda work: and then pullulg out
a bible, (which I brought on purpose in my poc-
ket for him $ Here Atkins, se id I), here is an'afr
distant that perhaps you had not before. So con-
founded was the.popr man, that it w^sibme time
before he could, speak; at last turning to his wife,.
My dear, he said, did I not tell you that God
could hear what tye said? Here's4 the book I pray?
ed for, when ydu and 1 kneeled under the bush *
God then heard us, and now* has! sent it. The
woman was surprised, and thought really God had
sent that individual bodk from heaven it but I turn-
ed to the young woman, arid desired her to explain
to the new convert,* that God;* may properly b£
said to answer our petitions, whe% in the course
of
•rff-ROBINS'ONCK-USWiE.-. 27c
of his providence, such particular things* come to*
pass as we petitioned for. This ^hc young wd^'
mari did effectually; but sur.ely Will. Atkins's joy!
cannot-be expressed.; no man being more thankful
for any thing in the world, than he was for hisi
Bible, nor desired it from a better principle,
i After several religious? discourses, I. desired-the*
ypung;woman to give me an account of the an-?
guifh slie felt when ihe was starving to death for
hunger; to which ihe readily consented, and be-
gan in the following manner r
."' Sir," said she, "all our victuals being gone*
after I had fasted one day^ my stomach was very;
fickifli, and at the approach of night, I was incline
ed to yawning,, and sleepy.. When I slept upon
the couch three hours, I awaked a little "refreshed £
three hours after my stomach being more and more
sickisli, 1 lay down again, but could not sleep, be*
ing very faint and ill. Thus I passed the second
day with a strange variety, first hunger, theii lick
again, with reaching* to vomit: that night 1
dreamed I was at Barbadoes, buying, plenty of
provisions^ and diiied heartily* But when 1 awa*
Iced, my spirits were exceedingly, funk, to find my-*
self in the extremity of famine. There was but
one glass of wine, which being mixed with sugar*
I drank up: but for want of substance, to digest
Upon, the fumes of it got into my head, and made
me senseless for some time. The third day 1 was
so ravenous and furious, that I could have eaten
a little child if it had comeiin ~my way; during
which time I was as mad as any creature in bedV
lam. In,one of these sits I fell down, and struck
my face against the corner of a pallet bed, where
my mistress lay :. the blood gushed out of my nose^
but by my exceflive bleeding, both the violence of
the fever, and the ravenous part of the hunger a»
bated. After this I grew sick again^ strove: to vo~
m/itj,
mit, but could not 5 then bleeding a second time^
I swooned away as dead; when I came to-myself I
had a dreadful gnawing pain in my stomach, which
went off towards night, with a longing desire for
food. I took a draught of water and sugar, but
it came up again; then I drank water without
sugar, and that staid with me, :1 laid hie down on
the bed, praying God would take me away; after
1 had slumbered, 1 thought myself a-dying, there-
fore recommended my soul to God, and wished
some body would throw me into the sea, All this
while my departing mistress lay by me; the last
bit of bread ihe hacj, she gave it to her dear child,
my young master. The:morning after, I fell in-
to a violent passion of crying, and after that into
hunger. I-espied the blood that came from my
nose in a bason, which I immediately swallowed
up. At night I had the usual variations, as pain
in the stomach, lick, sleepy, and ravenous; and
I had no thought but that 1 mould die before mor-
ning In the morning came on terrible gripings
in my bowels. At this time I heard my young
master's lamentations, by which I understood his
mother was dead: £oon after the sailors cried, A
sail, a foil, hallowing as if they were distracted,
for joy of that relief, which afterwards we re-
ceived from your hands."
. Surely never was a more distinct account of
starving to death than this. But to return to the
disposition of things among my people, 1 did not
take any notice to them of the sloop that I had
framed, neither would 1 leave them the two pieces
of brass cannon, or the two quarter-deck guns
that I had on board, lest, upon any disgust, they
sliould have separated, or turned pirates, and so
made the island a den of thieves, instead of a plan-
tation of sober pious people: but leaving them in
a flourishing condition, with a promise ta tend
them
them further frelief from [Brasil^ as sheep* hogs^
and cows, (being pbliged to kill the latter iatsea^
having no hay to feed them,,) I went on board the
ship again, the first of May 1695, after having
been twenty days ^mong them* and next mor-;
ning, giving them a salute of five guns, at partings
we .set fail for the Brasils, The .third day, tot
wards evening, there> happening a ca!rp, and the*
current being very strongi we were drove to theJ
N. N. E. towards the land. Spriie hours after we?
perceived thesea covered as it^ were with some*-;
thing very black, not- easily at first to be discover-/
ed: upon which our chief mate ascending the!
shrouds a little way, and taking a view with a!
perspecBve glass,-he cries out, an Army! An am
my, you fool^ said I, what do you -mean ?; Nay^'t
Sir, said he, dpn't be angry,! I a(IUre;you it is not|
only an army, but a fleet too; for I believe-thero
are a thousand canoes paddling along* and making?
with great haste towards us, , {
Indeed every one: of us^were surprised at( thisj
relation: and my nephew the, captain;could not?\
testwhattq think,pf ijy but thmight we nho^ld alb
be devpured> Nos vyas I free feom concern* whenl
I considered how nptuch w*e Were. ibe.c^Imed,. aLndi
what a strong current set towards the shores now-i
ever, I- encouraged him not to be^afraid, but bring*
the ship to an anchor, as soon as wo were certain)
that we must engage them. Accordingly* we did \
so, and furled all our sails; as to the savages,- wet
feared nothing, but ortly that they might (et the/
sliip on fire, to prevent which Ir ordered them tori
get their bdats out, apd fasten them, one close by I
the head, and the other by the stern, well man-,
ned, with fkeets and buckets to extinguish the
flames, should it so. happen. The savages soorii
came up with us, but there were not so many as*
the mate had said; for instead of a thousand canoes^
there
there were only'one hundred and twenty; tocr
many indeed for us, several of their canoes con-
taining abouc sixteen or seventeen men.
As they approached us, they seemed to be in
the greatest amazement, not knowing what to
make of us. They rowed round the ship, which
occasioned us to call to the men in the boats not'
to'suffer them to come near them. Hereupon they'
beckoned to the savages to keep back, which they J
accordingly did; but at their retreat they let sty
about fifty arrows among us, and very much-
* wounded one of our men in the longboat. I cal-!
led to them not to sire upon any account, but
handing them down some deal boards, the carpen-
ters made them a" kind, of a fence to fhifcld theta1
from the arrows. In half an hour alter th£y came
so near astern of us? that we had a perfect sight
of them; then they rowexl a littlfe farther out, till*
they came directly alongside of us, a'nd then ap-;
proached so near us, as they could hear us speak;
this made me order all our men to keep close, and
get sheir guits ready; In the mean time I order-'
ed Friday to* go Out* Upon deck, and ask them in :.
his language what they meant? No sooner did he
db so, but -ik of the savages, who were in the
foremost canoe, stooping down, shewed us their
naked backsides, as much as to fay in English, kiss'
our—: but Friday quickly knew what this meant,
by immediately cryfng out they Were goirig to:
shoot; unfortunately for "him, poor creature!
who fell under the cloud of three hundred arrows,
not less than seven piercing*through his body, kil-
ling one of the best servants, and faithfullest of
companions in all my solitudes and afflictions.
So enraged was I at the death of poor Friday,
that the guns, which before were charged with *
only powder, to frighten them, I ordered tb be
loaded with small shot; nor did the gunners fail *
in
in their aim, but at thisrbroadfide split and over-,
set thirteen or fourteen ot their canoes, which
killed numbers of them, and set the rest a-swira-
.raing: the others, frightened out of their wits,
little regarding their fellows drowning, scoured
away as fast as they could. One poor wretch our
people took up, swimming for his life, an hour
after. He was very sullen at first, so that he
would neither eat nor speak: but I took a way-to
cure him, by ordering them to throw him into the
sear which they did, and then he came swimming
back like a cork, calling in his tongue, as I sup-
pose, to save him. So we took him on board, but
it was a long time before we could make him
speak or understand English; yet when we had
taught him, he told us, they were going with,
their kings to fight a great battle: and when we
asked him, what made them corne up to us? he
said, to makee de great wonder look : where it is to
be noted, that those natives, and those of Africa,
always add two tf's at the end of English words,
as makee, takee, and the like, from which it is a
very difficult thing to make them break off. ]
Being now under fail, we took our last farewel
of poor honest Friday, and interred him \vith all
possible decency and solemnity; putting him into
a coffin, and committing him to the deep, at the
same time causing eleven guns to be fired for him.
Thus ended the life of one of the most grateful,
faithful, honest, and affectionate servants, that e-
ver any man was blessed with in the world.
Having now a fair wind for Brasils, in about
twelve clays time we madeland; in the latitude of
five degrees south of the line. Four days we kept.
on S. by E. in sight of shore, when we made cape
St. Augustine, and in three days we came to an
anchor off the bay of AIL Saints, I had great diffi-
culty here to get leave to hold correspondence on,
shore; for neither the figure of my partner, my
two
two merchant trustees, nor the fame of my won-
derful preservation in the island, cduld: procure me
. the favour, till such time as the prior of the mo-
nastery of the - Alignstines (to whom I had given*
500 moidores) obtained leave from the governor,
for me personally, with the cdptain and one more,
together with eight sailors, to come on shore; up*
6n &hs conditions that we ihoiild not land any
gofods Oiit of the ship, of carry any person away
without licence: I fotmd liieans however to get'
Oil ihdre three bales of English goodl, such as fihej
broad cloths, stuffs, and Tome 'linen,f which I
brought as a present for my partner, Who had
sent me on board a present of frdh provisions,
wine, and sweetmeats, worth above thirty moi*
dbres, including some tobacco, ah<f three or four
fih£ gold medals.' ,; f
'Here I delivered my partner in good's to the va-;
lUe of iobi. Sterling, arid obliged him to fit up*
the sloop I bought, for theufe of my island, iri%r-
der to send them refreshments: and so active was
be in this matter, that he,had the vessel finished in
a fqw days, to the master of which I gave parti-
cular instructions to find the'place. I soon load-
ed him with a small cargo; and one of our sailors
dffered to settle there, upon my letter to the Spa-;
nisli governor, if I would allot him tools and a
plantation. This I willingly granted, and gave
him tjie savage we had taken prisoner to be his
slave. All things being ready for the voyage, my
old partner told me, there was an acquaintance
of Ills, fa Bratil planter, who having fallen under
the displeasure of the church, and ifi fear of the
Inquisition, which obliged him to be concealed,
would be glad of such an opportunity to make his
escape, with his wife and two daughters; and if
I would allot them a plantation in my island, he
Wbuld give them a small stock to begiri with, for
•" * '::' * '• ; '"''' ' '* that
that the officers had already seized his effects and
festate, and *left him nothing but a little houihold
stuff, and two slaves. This request I presently
granted, concealing him and his family on board
our ship, till such time as the sloop (where all the
effects were) was gone out of the bay, and then
we put them on board, who carried some materi-
als, and plants for planting sugar-canes, along
with them. By this floop, among other things, 1
sent my subjects 3 milk-cows and 5 calves, about
22 hogs, 3 sows big with pig, 2 mares and a stone-
horse. I also engaged three Portugal women to
go for sake of the Spaniards, which, with the per-
secuted man's two daughters, were sufficient,'since
the rest had wives of their own, though in ano-
ther country: all which cargo arrived safe, no
doubt, to their exceeding comfort, who, with*
this addition, were about sixty or seventy people,
besides children.
At this place my truly honest and pious clergy-
man left me; for a ship beingready to set sail for
Lisbon, he aiked me leave to go thither 5 but I
assure you, it was with the grearest reluctancy I
parted from a person, whose virtue and piety me-
rited the greatest esteem.
From the Braiils we made directly over the At-
lantic ocean to the Cape of Good Hope, having a
tolerable good voyage, steering for the most part
S. E. We were on a trading voyage, and had a
supercargoe on board, who was to direct all the
ship's motions after she arrived at the Cape; only
being limited to a certain number of days, or stay,
by charter-party, at the several ports "she was to
go to. At the Cape we only took in fresh water,
and then sailed for the coast of Coromandel: we
were there informed, that a French man of war
of 50 guns, and tw*o large merchant ships, were
A a failed
sailed for the Indies, but we heard no more of
them.
In our passage we touched at the island of Mada-
gascar, where, though the inhabitants are natu-
rally fierce and treacherous, and go constantly
..armed with bows and lances, yet for some time
they treated us civily enough; and, in exchange
for knives, sciflars, and other trifles, they brought
'us eleven good fat bullocks, which we took part-
ly for present fresh victuals, and the remainder to
salt for the ship's use.
So curious was I to view every corner of the
world where I came to, that I went on shore as
often as 1 could. One evening, when on shore,
we observed numbers of .the people standing ga-
zing at us at a distance. We thought ourselves
in no danger, as they had hitherto used us kindly.
However, we cut three boughs out of a tree,
sticking them at a distance from us, which, it seems,
in that country, is not only a token of truce and
.amity, but when poles or boughs are set up on
the other side, it is a sign the truce is accepted.
In these treaties, however,.,there is one principal
thing to be regarded, that neither party come
beyond one another's three poles or boughs; so that
the middle space is not only secure, but is also allow-
ed,as a market for traffic and commerce: when the
truce is thus accepted, they {lick up their javelins
and lances at the first poles, and come on unarm-
ed; but if any violence is offered, away they run
to their poles, take up their weapons, and then
the truce is at an end. This evening it happened
that a greater number of people than usual, both
men and women, traded among us for such toys
as we had, with such great civility, that we made
us a little tent of large boughs of trees, some of
the meif resolving to lye on more all night. But,
for my part, 1 and some others took our lodging-
in
in the boat, with boughs of trees spread over it,
having a sail spread at the bottom to lye upbri.
About two o'clock in the morning, we were awa^
kened by the firing of muikets, and our men cry-
ing out for help, or else they would all be mur-
dered. Scarce had we time to get the boat ashore,
when our men came plunging themselves into th£
water, with about four hundred of the islanders
at their heels. We took up seven of the men;
three of them very much wounded, and one 1 esc
behind killed, while the enemy poured their ar-
rows so thick among us, that we were forced to
make a barricade, with boards lying at the fide of
the boat, to shield us from danger: and having
got ready our fire-arms, we returned them a vol-
ley, which wounied several of them, as we could
hear by their cries. ]h this condition \Ve lay till
break of day, and then making signals of distress
to the ship, which, .my nephew the captain heard
land understood, he weighed anchor and stood as
near the shore as possible, and then sent another
boat with ten hands m her to assist us; but we cal*
led to them not to come near, informing them of
our unhappy condition. However, they ventu-
red; when one of the men taking the end of a
tow-line in his one hand, and keeping our boat
between him and our adversaries, swam on board
us, and made fast our line to the boat; upon* this,
slipping our cables, they towed us out of the reach
of their arrows^ and quickly after, a broadside
was given them from the ship, 'which maa!e a most
dreadful havock among them. When we got on
board, we examined into the occasion "of this fray;
the men who flea1 informed us, that an old wo-
man, who fold milk within the poles, had brought
a young woman with her, who carried roots or
herbs, the sight of whom so much tempted our
men, that they offered rudeness to the maid* at
A a 2, which.
which the old woman set up a great cry; nor
would the'sailors part with the prize, but carried
her among the trees, while the old woman went
and brought a whole, army down upon them. At
the beginning of.the attack one of our men was
killed with a lance, and the fellow, who began
the mischief, paid dear enough for his mistress,
though as yet we did not know what had .become
ofjiim; the rest luckily escaped. The third night
aster the action, being curious to understand how
affairs stood, I took the supercargo, and twenty
stout fellows with me, and landed about two hours
before midnight, at the fame place where those
Indian's flood the night before, and there we di-
vided ouc men into two bodies, the boatswain
commanding one, and I another. It was so dark,
that we could see nobody, neither did we hear
any voice near us: but by and by the boatswain
falling over a dead body, we agreed to halt till
the moon should rise, which we knew would be
in an hour after* We perceived here no fewer
than two and thirty bodies upon^ the ground,
whereof two were not quite dead. Satisfied with
this discovery * I was for going on board again;
but the boatswain, and the rest told me, they
would make a visit to the Indian town^ where
those degs, so they called them, resided, asking
me at the same time to go along with them; for
they did not doubt, besides getting a good bootyt
but they should find Tom Jeffery there, for that
was the unhappy man we missed. But I utterly
refused to go, and commanded them back, being
unwilling to hazard their lives, as the safety of
the ship wholly depended upon them. Notwith-
standing all I could fay to them, they all left me
but one, and the supercargo: so we three return-
ed to the boat, where a boy was left, resolving
-to stay till they returned* At parting I "told theip
-. . I sup-
I supposed most of them would' run the same fate
with Tom. Jeffery. To this they replied, Come
boys, come along, we'll warrant we'll come off safe
enough: and so away they went, notwithstanding,
all my admonitions, either concerning their own
safety, or the preservation of the strip. Indeed
they were gallantly armed, every man having æ
musket, bayonet, and a pistol, besides cutlasses,
hungers, pole-axes, and hand-granadoesv They
came to a few Indian houses at first, whicH not:
being the town they expected, they went farther,
and finding a cow tied to a tree, they concluded
that slie would be a sufficient guide, and so it pro-'
"fred; for- after they mired her, slie led them di*
rectly to the town, which consisted of above two
hundred houses, several families living in some of
the huts together. .At their arrival, all being in
a profound sleep, the sailors agreed to divide them-.
selves info" three bodies, and set three parts of
the town on fire at once, to k\i those that were
escaping, and plunder the rest of the houses* Tims
desperately resolved: they went to work; but the
first party had not gone far, before they called
out to the rest, that they had found Tom. Jaf-
fery; whereupon they all ran up to the place,,
and found the poor fellow indeed hanging up na*
ked by one arm, and his throat cut almost from
ear to ear: in a house that was hard by the tree
they found sixteen or seventeen Indians, who had:
been concerned in the fray, two or three of them,
being wounded, who were not gone to steep;.this
house they set on slie first, and in a few minutes
after, Eve or six places more in the town appear-
ed in flames* The conflagration spread like wild-
fire, their houses being all of wood, and covered
with flags or rushes. The poor affrighted inhabi-
tants endeavoured to run out to save their lives,,
but; they were driven back inta the flames by the
'" . A. a 3 sailors,.
sailors, and filled without mercy* At the first
house above mentioned, after the boatswain had
(lain-two with his pole axe, he threw a hand gra-
nade into the house, .which bursting, made a ter-
rible havock, killing and wounding most of them 5
and their king and most of his train, who were
then in that house, fell victims to their fury 4 eve-
ry creature of them being either smothered or
burnt, All this while they never fired a gun, lest
the people should awaken faster than they could
overpower them. But the fire awakened them
fast; enough, which obliged our fellows to keep
together in bodies. - By.this time the whole town
.was in a flame, yet their fury rather increased/
calling out to one another to remember Tom,
Jeffery. The terrible light of this conflagration
made me very uneasy, and roused my nephew the
captain, and the rest of his men, who knew no*
thing of the matter. When he perceived the dread*
ful smoke, and heard the guns go off, he readily
concluded his men were in danger; he therefore
takes another boat, and comes ashore himself, with
thirteen men well armed. He was greatly sur-
prised to seeme and only two men in the boat,
but more so when I told him the story; but tho*
I argued with him, as 1 did writh his men, about
the danger of the voyage, the interests of the:
merchants and, owners, and the safety.of the ship,,
yet my nephew, like the rest, declared, that he-
would rather lose the ship, his voyage, his life^
and all, than his men should be lost; for want of
help : and so away he .went. For my part, seeing
him resolved to go, I had not power to stay be-
hind. He ordered the pinnace bac)* again tor
twelve men more, and then we marched directly'
.as the flame guided us.. But surelyv never wm3
such a scene of horror beheld, or more dismal'
cries beards except when Oliver Cromwell took
Drogheda"
Drogheda in Ireland, -where he neither spared'
man, woman, nor child.
The first, object, I think, we met with, was the
ruins of one of their habitations, before which,
lay four nien and three women killed, and two
more burnt to death among the sire, which was
now decaying. Nothing could appear more bar-
barous than this revenge; none more cruel than
the authors of it. As we went on, the fire in*
creased, and the cry proceeded in proportion. We*
had not gone much farther, when we beheld three
naked women, followed by sixteen or seventeen
men, flying with the greatest swiftness.from our
men, who (hot one of them in our light. When
they perceived, us whom they supposed also their*
murderers, they set up a most dreadful shriek, and
both t>f them, swooned away in the fright. This
was a light which might have softened the hardest
neart; and in pity we took some ways to let them
know we would not hurt them, while the poor
creatures with bended knees, and lift-up hands,,
made piteous lamentations to us to save their lives.
I ordered our men not to hurt a,ny of the poor-
creatures whatsoever j but being willing to un-
derstand the occasion of all this,, 1 wenr among
these unhappy wretches, who-neither understood
me, nor the good I meant them However, be-
ing resolved to put an^ end to this barbarity, I
ordered the men to follow me. We had not gone
fifty yards before we came up with the boatswain^,
with, four of our men at his heels, all of them-
covered with bloodand dust, and in searchof more
people,to satiate their vengeance. As soon as we
sew them we called out, and made them Understands
who we were; upon which they came up to usv
setting up a halloo of triumphs in token that more
fielp was come. Koble captain, said he to my
J^ephewj I'm glad you're come t. we have not half
donjQ
done with these villa-nous hell-hound dog?, we'lF
root out the Very nation of them from the earths
and kill more than poor Tom has hairs upon his
head: and this he Went on till I interrupted him.
Blood-thirsty dog! laid I, will your cruelty never
end? I charge you touch not one creature more;,
stop your hands, and stand still, or you're a dead
man^ this moment. Why, Sir, said he, you neither
know whom you are protecting, nor what they
have done; but pray come hicher, and behold an
instance of compassion, if such can merit your
clemency; and with that he-shewed me the poor
fellow with his throat cut, hanging upon the tree;
Indeed here was enough to fill their breasts withb
rage, wh'ch however I thought had gone too far,
agreeable to these words of Jacob to his sons Si-
meon and I.evi : Curstd he their anger for it was
fierce; and their -wrath'for it was cruel. But this,
sight made my nephew and the rest as bad as they;
nay, my nephew declared, his concern was only
for his men; as for the people, not a foul of them
ought to live. Upon this the boatswain aild eight
.more directly turned about, and went to finish* the
intended tragedy; which being out of my power
to prevent, I returned back both from the dismal,
sight, and'the piteous cries of those unfortunate
creatures, who were made victims to their fury-
Indeed it was an eggregious piece of folly inme to
return to the boat with but one attendant; and I
had very near paid for it, having narrowly esca-
ped forty armed Indians, who had been alarmed
by the conflagration; but having passed the place
where they stood, I got to the boat accompanied*
with the supercargo, and so went on board, send-
ing the pinnace back again, to assist the men ifi
what might happen. When I had got to the boat,,
the fire was almost extinguished, and the noise was*
abated; but I hadscarce been half an hour on board
the
the (hip, when I heard' another volley given by
our sailor^ and a great smoke, which, as I after-
wards found, was our men falling upon those houses
and persons that stood between them and the sea:
but here they spared the wives and children, and
killed only the men, to the number of about six-
teen or seventeen. By the time they got to the*
shore, the pinnace and the (hip's boat were rea-
dy to receive them, and they all got safe on board,
not a man of them having received the least hurt,,
except two, one of whom strained his foot, and
the other burnt his hand a little; for they met
with no resistance, the poor Indians being unpre-
pared, amazed, and confounded.
I was extremely angry with every one of them,
but particularly with the captain, who, jnstead of
cooling the rage of the mcn^ had prompted them
on to farther mischief, nor could he make me any
other excuse, but that as he was a man he could
not master his passions, at the light of one of his
men so cruelly murdered. As for the rest:, know-
ing they were not under my command, they took
no notice of my anger; but rather boasted of their x
revenge. According to all their accounts, they
killed or destroyed about one hundred and fifty
men, women, and children, besides burning the
town to aslies. They took their companion Tom
Jeflfery from the tree, covered him with some of
the ruins, and so left him. But however this ac-
tion of our men might seem to them justifiable,
yet I always openly condemned it with the appel-
lation of the Majsacre of Madagascar. For tho'
they had (lain this Jeflery, yet certainly he was
the first aggressor, by attempting to violate the
chastity of a young innocent woman, who ven-
tured down to them on the faith of the public ca-
pitulation^ which was so treacherously broken.
While we were under sail, the boatswain would
oftea
often defend this bloody action, by saying, that
the Indians had broke the truce the night before, by
Jhooting one of our men without provocation; and
tho' the poor fellow had taken a little liberty with
the wench, he ought not to have been murdered in,
so x^illainous a manner: and that they had attcd
nothing but what the divine laws* commission ed'to be
done to such homicides* However, I was in the
fame mind "as before, telling them that they were
murderers, tapcl bid them depend upon it, that
God would blafl: their voyage for such an unpa-
ralleled piece of barbarity.
When we came into the gulf of Persia, five of
our men, who ventured on shore, were either kil-
led or made slaves by the Arabians, rhe rest of
them having scarce time to escape to their boat.
This made .me upbraid them afresh with the just
retribution of Heaven for such actions: upon
which the boatswain very warmly allied me, whe-
ther those men, on whom the tower of Siloam
fell were greater sinners than the rest of the Ga-
lileans; and besides, Sir, said he, none of these
five poor men that are lost were with us at the
massacre of Madagascar, as you call it, and there-
fore your reprehension is very unjust, and your
application improper, Besides, added he, you are
continually using the men very ill, upon this ac-
count, and being but a passenger yourself, we are
not obliged to bear it; nor can we tell what ill
designs you may have to bring us* to judgment for
it in England; and therefore if you do not leave
this discourse, as also not concern yourself with
any of our affairs, 1 will leave the ftip, and not
fail among such dangerous company.
AU-this I heard very patiently; but it being of-
ten repeated, lat length told him, the concern I
had on board was none of his business; that I was
3 considerable ~owner in the ship, and therefore
had
liad a right to speak in common, and that I was no
way accountable to him, nor to any body else." As
no more passed for some time after, I thought all
had been over. At this time we were in the road
of Bengal, where, going on more with the super-
cargo, one day, in the evening, as I was preparing
toNgo on board, one of the men came to me, and
told me, I need not trouble myself to come to the
boat, for that the cockswain and others had order-
ed him not to carry me on board any more. This
insolent message much surprised me» yet I gave
him no answer to it, but went directly and ac-
quainted the supercargo, intreating him to go on
board, and by acquainting the captain with it,
prevent the mutiny which I perceived would hap-
pen, But before I had spoken this,-the matter
was effected on board: for no sooner was he gone
off in the boat, but the boatswain, guihier, car-
penter, and all the inferior officers, came to the
quarter-deck, desiring to speak with the captain;
and there the boatswain made a long harangue,
exclaiming against me, as before mentioned; that
if I had not gone ashore peaceably for my owa di*
Version, they by violence would have compelled
me for their satisfaction; that as they had shipped
with the captain, so they would faithfully serve
him; but if I did not quit the ship, or the captain
oblige me to it, they would leave the ship imme-
diately ; hereupon, turning his face about by way
of signal, they all cried out, O^vE and ALL,
LNE and ALL.
You may be sure, that though my nephew was
a man of great courage, yet he could not but be
surprised at their sudden and unexpected behavi-
our: and though he talked stoutly to them, and
afterwards expostulated with them, that in corn-
men justice to me, who was a considerable owner
in the ship, they could not turn me, as it were,
out
out of ray own house, which might bring their
lives in danger, should they ever be taken in En-
gland: nay, though he invited the boatswain on
shore to accommodate matters* with me, yet all
this, I fay, signified nothing.: they would have
nothing to dp with me, and they were resolved to
go on shore, if I came on board. Well, said my
nephew, if you are so resolved, permit me to talk
with him, and then I hav£ done: and so he came
to me, giving me an account of their resolution,
how one and all designed to forsake the ship when
I came on board, for which lie was mightily con-
cerned. I am glad to fee you, nephew, said I,
and rejoice it is no worse, 'since they have not re-
belled agamst you: 1 only desire you to send my
necessary things on shore, with a sufficient sum of
money, and I will find my w^ay to England as well
as I can. Though this grieved my nephew to the
heart, yet there was no^remedy but compliance;
in short, fill my necessaries were sent me,* and so
this matter was over in a few hours.
I think I was now near a thousand leagues far-
ther off England by sea than at my little kingdom,
except this 'difference', that I might travel by land
over the Great Mogul's country to Surat, from
/thence up to Bassora, by scaup the Persian gulpb,
then take the way bf the caravans over the Ara-
bian desert to Aleppo and Scahderobn, there rake
shipping to Italy ?aiid so travel by-land into France,
arid*from thence'crofs th'efea torEngland.: ,
My nephew left me two persons to attend me;
one qf^theiii. was his servant, and'the other ;cierk
to the purser, \Vhb engaged 'to be mine. I took
lodgings In^anE^glifliwoman^ houses where se-
Vefal F^ehch^ one English, and two Italian mer-
chants *riesided." The handsome entertainment I
met with here, occasioned me to staynine moriths,
considering what course I should take. Sbtne En-
* : glisli
glifli goods I had with me of great Value, besides
a thousand pieces of eight, and a letter of credence
for more, if there was any such necessity. The
goods I soon disposed of to advantage, and bought
here several good diamonds, which I could easily
carry about with me. One morning the English
merchant came to me, as being very intimate to-
gether,, Countryman, said he> I have a project to
communicate to you, which, I hope, will suit to both
our advantage. To he fiort, Sir, we are both in a
remote part of the world from our country, but yet
in a place where nlen of, business may get a great .
deal of money 4 Now, if ymi will put a thousand
pounds to my thousand pounds, we will hire aflrip
to our satisfaclion ; you shall be captain, I will bs
merchant, and we'7/ go a trading voyage to China;
for why should we lye fit 11 like drons, while the
whose world is in a continual ntotion.
This proposal soon got my consent, being very
agreeable to my rambling genius; and the more
so, because I looked upon my countryman lobe a
very sincere person; it required some time before
we could get a vessel to our mind, and sailors to
man it according!^; at length we bought a ship,
and got an English mate, boatswahi, and gunner,
a Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese foremast-
tnen; and, for want of others, made shift with
Indian seamen. We first sailed to Achin, in the
island of Sumatra, and then to Siani, where we
bartered otir wares for some arrack and opium,
the last of which bore a great pride among the
Chinese; in a word, we went up to Sufkan, ma-'
king a very great 'Voyage; and, after eight months
time, I returned to Bengal, very well* satisfied
with* this adventure^ having not only got a"suffi-
cient quantity of money, but an insight of getting
a great deal more.
Tlie next voyage my friend proposed to me, %
B b was
was to go among the Spice islands, and bring homd
a load of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts,
islands belonging partly to Spain, but where the
IJutch trade very considerably* We were not
long preparing for this voyage, which we made
no less successful than the last, touching at Bor-
nea, and several other places which I do not per-
fectly remember, and returning home in about five
months time. We soon sold our spices, which
were chiefly cloves, and some nutmegs, to the
Persian merchants, who carried them away for
the gulph; and, in short, making five to one ad-
vantage, we were loaded with money*
Not long after my friend and I had made up our
accounts, to our entire satisfaction, there came in
a Dutch coaster from Batavia, of about two hun-
dred tons. The crew of this vessel pretended
themselves so sickly, that there were not hands
sufficient to undertake a voyage, and the captain
having given out that he intended to go to Europe, 1
public notice was given that the ship was to be
ibid. No sooner did this come to our ears, but
we bought the ship, paid the master, and took
possession. We would also haye very willingly
entertained some of the men: but they having
received their share of booty, were not to be
found, being all together fled to Agra, the great-
city of the Mogul's residence; and from thence
Were to travel to Surat, and so by sea to the Per-
sian gulph. And indeed they had reason to fly in
this manner: for the truth of it was, the pre-
tended captain was the gunner only, and not the
commander: that having been on a trading voy-
age, they were attacked on shore by the Malay-
ans, who killed three men, and the captain : after
whose death the other eleven men run away with
the ship to the bay of Bengal, and left the mate
and other five men more on shore; but of this af-
'•&• • "* fair
fair we (hall have occasion to speak at more length
hereafter.
• However they came by the ship, we thought
we bought it honestly; neither did we suspect any
thing of the matter; when the man shewed us a
bill of sale for the ship (undoubtedly forged) to one
Emanuel Clostershoven, which name he went by.
And so without any more to do, we picked uj>
some Dutch and English seamen, resolving-for
another voyage for cloves among the Philippian
and Malacca islands: in short, we continued thus
five or fix years, trading from port to port with
extraordinary success; in the seventh year we
undertook a voyage to China, designing to touch
at Sianiy and buy some rice by the way. In this
voyage, contrary winds beat us up and down for
a considerable time among the islands in the straits .
of Malacca. No sooner were we clear of those
rugged seas but we perceived our ship had sprung
a leak, which obliged us to put into the river
Cambodia, which lyes northward of the gulph, and
goes up to Siam.
One day as I was on shore refreshing myself,
there comes to me an Englishman, Who >vas a
gtrnner's mate on board an English East India ship,
riding up the river, near the city of Cambodia,
Sir, laid he, you may wonder at my business, having
never seen me in your life ,• but though I am a
stranger, I have something to tell you that very
nearly concerns you ; and indeed it is the imminent
danger you are in has moved me to give to you this
timely notice. Danger! said I, what danger ? I
_ know of none, except my ship being leaky, for
which I design to have run her aground to-morrow
morning. Sir, said he, / hope you will be better
employed, when you shall hear wbat I have to fay
to you. You know the town of Cambodia is about
lg leagues up this river: about three leagues on this

side of it, there, lyes two Dutch and three English
flips. Aad would you venture here, without consi-
dering what strength you have to engage them? I
knew not what he meant by this discourse, and
turning lhort upon him, bir, said I, I know no
reason I have to be afraid either of any English or
Dutch ships. I am no interloper,- and what busi-
ness have they then with me? Well, Sir, said the
man, «if you do think yourself secure, all as I can
fay, you mist tajze your chance; however, 1 am.
very sorry you are so deaf to good advice^ hut 1 as-
sure you, if you do not put to sea immediately, you
will be attacked by five long boats full of men, hang-
ed yourself for a pirqt^ if you are taken, and the
particulars examined afterwards I thought, Sirr

for fitch a singular piece of service* Sir, said If

plain yourself, and I'll go on board this minute,
whether the leak be stopped or no. Why, Sir,
ftid; he, to be slioxt, because time is precious, the-
'matter fs this: You know well enough that you was >
lifith the ship at Sumatra, whereby our captainJuas
murdered by the Malayans, with three of his sai-
lors, mid th&t either you, orsxme who were oh board!*
you, ran away with the Jhip, and are since turneds
pirates at sea. 4 AVus Sir, this is the sum tf what
I had to say $ and I can positively assure you, that
if you be taken^ you will be executed without much
ceremony ;fdr undoubtedly you cannot but be sensibly
what little law merchant foips foew to. pirate^ when^
ever they fall into their unmerciful hands*
Sir, said I, I thank you for your kind informal
-tion: and though 1 am sure no man could conic
more horiestly by the ship than I ha\{e done; yet
knowing their enterprise, and being satisfied of
your honest intention, 111 be upon my defence*
Prithee Sir^ said the man,, don't talk of being upon*
your defence, the best you can make is to be out of
danger; and therefore, if you have any regard to
your life, and the Hues of your men, take the ad'
vantage, without fail, of -putting out to sea at high
•water; by which means, as you have a whole tide
before you, you will be gone too far out of their
reach before they can come down.
I am mighty well satisfied, said I, in this parti-
cular, and of your kindness, which merits my
greatest esteem? pray, Sir, what amends shall I
make you; He replied, / know not what amends
you are willing to make, because you may have some
doubts of its certainty shut to convince you of the
truth of what I say, I have one offer to make to you.
On board one of the Engli/h Jhips, I have nineteen
months pay due to me, and this Dutchman that is
with me has seven months pay due to him, which if
you will make good to us, we will go along with you*
If you shall find, that there is nothing in what we
have said, then we Jhall desire nothing; but when
you are convinced that we have saved the ship, your
life, and the lives of the men, we will leave the
whole t$ your generosity.
So reasonable did this every way appear, that
I immediately consented, and we went directly on
board. As soon as we came on board, my part-
ner calls joyfully out, That they had stopped the
leak! Well, thank God, said I, but pray let us
weigh anchor forthwith. Weigh! said he, what'
is the meaning of this hurry? Pray ask no ques-
tions, said I, but all hands to work, without lo-
sing a moment's time: upon which in great sur-
prise, the captain was called, who immediately
ordered the anchor to be got up; and though the
tide was not quite down, yet being assisted with a
little land breeze, we stood out to sea. I then
called my partner into the cabin, and related the
story at large, which was confirmed, and more
B b,3 . ampli-
amplified.by'the two men I Had brought on boards
Scarce had we finished our discourse, upon this*
head, but a sailor came to the cabin-doorr with a
message from the captain, that we were chased'
by five sloops full of armed men. Very well, said
J, it Is plain now there is somethipg in it. And
so-going upon deck, I told all the men there was
a (Jesign for seizing the ship, and of executing us
for pirates; and alked them, whether they would
faithfully stand by us, and by one another?* Ter
which they unanimously replied, that they would
fight to their last drop of blood. I then asked the
. captain, which way he thought best for us to ma-
nage the battle? Sir, laid he, the^only method h
to keep them off iviih our great/hot as long as we
are able, and then have recourse to our small arms:
and when both these fail us, then retire to close
quarters, when perhaps the enemy, wanting mate-
rials, can neither break open our balk headr, nor
get in upon us. Mean time the gunner was order-
ed to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out of
the steerage, and so load them with musket bulletsr
and small pieces of old iron; and the deck being
cleared, we prepared for the engagement, still
however, keeping out at sea. The boats follow-
ed us with all the fail they could make, and we
could perceive the two foremost were Engli(br
which outsailed the rest by two leagues, and which
we found would come up with us: hereupon we-
fired a guri without ball, intimating that they should
bring to, and we put out a flag of truce, as a
signal for parley; but finding them crouding after
us," till they came within shot, we took in our
white, and hanging out the red flag, immediately
fired at them with ball > we then called to then*
with a speaking trumpet, bidding them at their
peril keep c*ff.
But all this signified nothing 5 for depending up-
'* OH.
on the strength that followed them, they were
resolutely bent for mischief: hereupon 1 ordered
them to bring the ship to, by which means, they
laying upon our broadside, we let fly at them at
once, one of whom carried away the stern of ^the
hindermost boat, and obliged them not only to
take down their fail, but made them all run to the
head of the boat, to keep them from sinking i and
lo she lay by, having enough of it. In the meart
time we prepared to welcome the foremost boat
in the fame manner. While we were doing this;
one of the three hindermost boats came up to the
relief of that which was disabled, and took the
men out of her. We again called to parley with
them; but instead of an answer, one of the boats
came close under our stern; whereupon our gun-
ner let fly his two chace-guns, but milling, the
men in the boat shouted, and waving their caps,
came on with greater fury. To repair this seem-
ing disgrace, the gunner soon got ready, and firing
the second time, did a great deal of mischief among
the enemy. We waved again, and bringing our
^.quarter to bear upon them, fired three guns more,
when we found the boat a-sinking, and several
men already in the sea; hereupon, manning our
pinnace, I gave orders to save as many as they
could, and instantly to come on board, because
the rest'of-their boats were approaching: accord-
ingly they did so, and took up three of them, one
of whom was almost past recovery; and then
crouditig all the fail we could, after our men came
on board, we sto6d out farther to sea, so that the
other three boats gave over their chace,'when they
came up to the first two. Thus delivered from
imminent danger, we changed our course to the
eastward, quite out of the course of all European.
#iips.
Being now at sea, and inquiring more partiem
larly
larly of the two seamen, the meaning of all this,,
the Dutchman, at once, let us into the secret.
He told us, that the fellow who sold us the ship,
was an arrant thief, who had runaway with her;
that the captain was treacherously murdered on
the coast of Malacca by the natives there, with
three of his men; that he, the Dutchman, and
four more, being obliged to have recourse to. the
woods for their safety, at length escaped by means
of a Dutch ship, in its way to China, which had
sent their boat on shore for fresh water: That, af-
ter this he went to Batavia, where two of the
seamen belonging to the ship (who had deserted
the rest in their travels) .arrived, and there gave
an account that the fellow who ran away with
the ihip had fold her at Bengal to a set of pirates,
who went a cruising, and had already taken one
English and two Dutch ships richly laden*
ISiow, though this was absolutely false, yet con-
cerning us directly, my partner truly said, that
our deliverance was to be esteemed so much the
more by reason, had we fallen into their hands,
we could have expected nothing from them but
immediate death, considering our accusers would
have been our judges: and therefore his opinion
was, to return directly to Bengal, where being
known, we could prove how honestly we came by
the ship, of whom we bought her, and the like,
and where we were sure of some justice; at least
would not be hanged first, and judged afterwards,
I was at first of my partner's opinion; hut when
J had more seriously considered, of the matter, I
told him we ran a great hazard in attempting to
retura^ being on the wrong side of the straits of
Malacca, and that if, upon alarm given, we mould
be taken by the Dutch ofFBatavia or Englisti else-
where, our running away would be a sufficient
evidence to condemn us, This danger indeed
startled
startled not only my partner, but likewise all the
ship's company 5 so we changed our former reso*
lution, and resolved to go to the coast of Ton-
quin, and so to that of China, where pursuing
our first design as to trade, we might likewise have
an opportunity to dispose of the ship some way or
other, and to return to Bengal in any,country
vessel we could procure. This being agreed to,
we steered away N. N. E* about 50 leagues off
the usual course to the east, which put us to some
incoriveniencies. As the wind blew steadily a-
gainst us, our voyage became very tedious, and
we began to be afraid of want of provision; and
what was still worse, we apprehended, that as •
those ihips, from whose boats we had escaped, were
bound to China, they might get before us and
have given fresli information, which might create
another vigorous pursuit. Indeed I could not
help being grieved, when I considered that I, who
had never wronged or defrauded any person in
my life, was now pursued like a common thief j
and, if taken-, to run the greatest danger of being
executed as such; and, though innocent, I found
myself under the necessity of flying for myJTafety t
and thereby, escape being brought to shame, of
which I was even more afraid than of death itself^
It was easy to read my dejection m my counte-
nance. My mind was oppressed, like those un*
happy innocent persons, who, being overpower-
ed by blasphemous and perjured evidences, wick-
edly resolved to take away their lives, or ruin*
their reputation* have no other recourse in this
world to ease their sorrow, but sighs, pray er s>
and tears. My partner seeing me so concerned,
encouraged me as well as he could r and, after
describing to me the several ports of that coast,
he told me, he would either put in on the coast
of Cechinchina, or else in the bay of Tonquin,
from
from whence we might go to Macao, a town once
possessed by the Portuguese, and where still many-
European families reside.
To this place we steered, and early next morn-
ing came in fight of the coast; but thought it ad-
visable to put into a small river, where we could
either over-land, or by the ship's pinnace, know
what vessels were in any ports thereabouts. This
happy step proved our deliverance; for next morn-
ing there came to the bay of Tonquin two Dutch
ships, and a third without any colours; and, in
the evening, two English ships steered the fame
course. The river where "we were was but small,
and run but a few leagues up the country north-
ward: the country was wild and barbarous, and
the people thieves, having no correspondence with
any other nation, dealing only in fi/h, oil, and
such gross commodities} and one barbarous cus-
tom they still retained, that when any vessel was
unhappily shipwrecked upon their coast, th^y make
the men prisoners or slaves; so that now we might
fairly say we were surrounded by enemies both*
bj sea and land. ^
As the (hip had been leaky, we took the oppor-^
tunity, in this place, to search her, and to stop *
up the places which let in the water* We accor-
dingly lightened her, and bringing our guns and
other moveable things to one side, we essayed to
bring her down, that we might come at her bot-
tom: but, upon second consideration, we did not*
think it safe to let her lye on dry ground, neither^
indeed was the place convenient for it. The in-
habitants, not uled to such a sight as to fee a ship
lye down on one side, and heel in towards the
ihore, not perceiving her men, who were at work •
on her bottom, with stages and boats on the off-
side, presently imagined the ship had been cast a-
way, and lay fast on the ground. Agreeable to
this
this supposition they surrounded us with ten or
twelve large^boats, with a resolution, undoubted-
ly, to plunder the (hip, and to carry away those
they found alive for slaves to their king. But
when they perceived our men hard at work on the
strip's bottom and side, washing, graving, and flop-
ping her, it silled them all with such surprise, that
they stood gazing, as tho* they were confounded.
Nor could we imagine what their design was;
however, for fear of danger, we handed down
arms and ammunition, to those at work, in order
to defend themselves; and indeed this precaution
was absolutely necessary; for, in a quarter of an
hour after, the natives, concluding it was really
a sliipwreck, and that we were saving our lives
and goods, which they thought belonged to them,
came down upon our men, as though it had been
in a line of battle. We lay at present but in a
very unfit posture to fight; and before the stages
could be got down, or the men in the boat come
on board as they were ordered, the Cochincljineses
were upon them, and two of their boats boarding
our longboat, they began to lay hold of our men
as prisoners. The first they seized was a stout
English sailor, who never fired his musket, like a
fool, as I imagined, but laid it down in the boat;
but he knew what he was doing; for by main force
he dragged the Pagan out of the boat into ours,
by the two ears, and knocked his brains out against
the boat's gunnel: A Dutchman that was next
him snatched up" the musket, and knocked down
five more with the butt end of it; however, this
was doing very little to their number^ but a. strange
unexpected accident, which rather merits laughter
than any thing else, gave our men a complete vic-
tory over them.
It seems the carpenter, who was preparing to
grave the outside of the ship, as well as to pay
the
the seams, where he caulked, to stop the leaks,
had gotten two kettles just let down in the boat,
one filled with boiling pitch, and the other with
rosin, tallow, oil, and such stuff as the shipwrights
use: the carpenter's man had a great iron laddie
with which he used to supply the workmen with
hot stuff, and as two of the enemies entered the
boat where the fellow stood, he saluted :hem with a
full laddleof thehot boiling liquor, which,*the poor
creatures being half naked, made them roar out,
and jump into the sea. Well done, Jack, says the
carpenter, give them the other doze: and so step-
ping forward himself, takes a mop, and dipping
it into the pitch-pot, he and his man so plentifully
flung it among them, as that none escaped being
scalded r upon which they all made the belt of
their way, crying and howling in such a frightful
manner, that in all my adventures t never heard
the like. And indeed nevdr was I better pleased
with any conquest than I was with this, there be-
ing so little bloodshed, and having an aversion to
killing such savage wretches, (more than was ne-
cessary,) as knowing they came on errands, which
their laws and customs made them think were just
and equitable. By this time all things being in
order, and the ship swimming, they found their
mistake, so they did not venture a second attack:
Thus ended our merry fight; and having got some
rice, bread, roots, arid sixteen good hogs on board
the day before, we set sail, not daring to go in-
to the bay of Tonquin, but steered N. E. towards
the isle of Formosa, or as though we would go to
the Manillas, or Philippine islands, for fear of
meeting with any European ships. When we an-
chored at the isle Formosa, the inhabitants, not
only courteously supplied us with provisions and
freshwater, but dealt very fairly and honestly
with us in their bargains and agreements. From
this
this place we (leered north, keeping still off the
coast of China, till we were beyond all its ports
where European ships usually come; and at length
being come to the latitude of thirty degrees, we
resolved to put into the first trading port we
should come at ; and standing for the shore, a boat
came off two leagues to us with an old Portuguese
pilot on board, who offered his service; we very
gladly accepted him, and sent the boat back again.
And now, having the old man on board, I talked
to him of going to Nanquin, the rcost northward
part of the coast of China. What will you do
there? said he, smiling, 1 told hrm we would sell
our cargo and purchase calicoes, raw and wrought
iilks, tea, &c. and so return the same way back,
O, said he, you had better put in at Macao, where
you may buy China wares as cheap as at Nanquin,
and fell your opium at a greater advance. But?
said T, we are gentlemen as well as merchants,
and design to fee the great city of Pekin, and the
magnificent court of the monarch of China, Why
then, said he, you should go to Ningpo, where
there is a navigable river that goes through the
heart of that vast empire, two hundred and seven-
ty leagues from the sea, which crosses all the ri*
vers, passes considerable hills, by the help of the
sluices and gates, and goes even up to the city of
Pekin. You may go to Nanquin, if you please,
and travel to Pekin, and there is a Dutch flup just
before bound that way. At the name of a Dutch
or English ship, I was struck with confusion f. they
being as great a terror to me in this Vessel, as an
Algerine man-of war is to them in the Mediter-
ranean. The old .man finding me troubled, Sii%
said he, 1 hope the Dutch are not now at war
with your nation: No, said I, but God knows
what liberty they may take when out of the reach
of the law. Why, fays he, what occasion is there
C c for
.for peaceable merchants to fear? For, believe
me, they never meddle with any but PIRATES,
At the mentioning of the word pirates, my
countenance turned to that of scarlet; nor was it
possible for me to conceal it from the old pilot;
who taking notice of it, Sir, said he, take 'what
course you please, Is 11 do you all the service I can.
Signior, said 1, 1 am a little concerned at your
mentioning pirates; I hope there are none such
in these seas, because you see in what a weak con-
dition we are to defend ourselves. 44 O, Sir,"said
he" "if that's all, don't be concerned, I don't
44 remember one in these seas these fifteen years,
44 except about a month ago one was seen in the
44 bay of Siam, but she is gone to the south-
44 ward ; neither was she built for a privateer, but
44 was.run.away with by a reprobate captain, and
-u some of his men, the right captain having been
44 murdered by the Malayans"
What! said I, (as though ignorant of what had
happened,) did they kill the captain! 44, No,"said
he,' u it is generally thought the Malayans
44 murdered him; but perhaps they might procure
44 them to do it, and therefore they justly deserve
44 hanging. The rogues were lately discovered
44 in jthe bay of Siam, in the river of Cambodia,
44 by some Dutchmen who belonged to the fhip$
*4 and had much ado to escape the five boats that
44 pursued them, but they have all given such an
44 exact description of the ship, that wherever they
44 find her, they will be sure to know her, and
44 they have solemnly swore to give no quarter to
44 the Qaptain or the seamen, but hang them every
44 one up at the yard arm, without any formal
." business of bringing them to a court of judica-
"ture."
Being sensible, that, having the old man on
board; he was incapable of doing me any mischief,
Well,
Well, Signior, said I, it is for this very reason I
would have you carry us up to Nanquin, where
neither English nor Dutch ships come: and I must
tell you their captains are a parcel of rash, proud,
insolent rascals, that neither know what belongs
to justice, nor how to behave themselves as the
laws of God or nature direct. Fellows that would
prove murderers to punish robbers, and take upon-
them to adjudge innocent men to death, without
any proof to prove them guilty 5 tut perhaps I
may live to call them to account for it, in a place
where they may be taught how justice is to be exe-^
cuted. And so I told him all the story of buying
the ship, and how we were saved by the means of
two men: that the murder of the captain by the
Malayans, as also the running away wiih the ship,1
I believed to be true; but that we, who bought it,
were turned pirates, was a mere fiction, to cover
their cowardice and foolish behaviour, when they
attacked us, and the blood of those men "we kill in?
our own just defence, lay to their dooiywho sent
to attack us by surprise.
S/r, said the old man amazed, "you have ta-*
44 ken the right course to steer to the north, andt
44 if I m'ght advise you, I would have you sell
44 your ship in China, and buy or build another inr
44 that country; and I'll procure people to buy
44 the one and sell the other." Well, butSigniorr
said I, if i sell the ship in this manner, I may-
bring some innocent persons into the fame danger
as I have gone through, perhaps, worse, even
death itself, whereby 1 should be as guilty of their
murder as villainous executioners. "That need
44 not trouble you," (fays the old man ;):" Fllr
44 find "a* way to prevent that; for these command*
44 ers you talk of I know them very well, will in*
44 form them rightly of the mat ter as you have rela-
u ted, and I am persuaded they will not only believe
C c 2, "me.
"me, but act more cautiously for the suture."
And will you deliver one message from me to them?
41 Yes, (said he,) if you will give it under your
"hand, that I may prove it is not my own pro-
44 duction." Hereupon I wrote a large account
of their attacking me in their long-boat, the pre-
tended reason and unjust design of it; thgt they
had done what they might be asliamed of, and
could not answer for at any tribunal in England.
But this letter was written in vain. Providence
ordered things another way. We sailed directly
for Nanquin, and in about thirteen days fail, came
to an anchor at the south-west point of the great
jrulf of that place, where we learned that two
Dutch ships were gone the length before us, and
that we should certainly fall into their hands. We
were all at a great Joss in this exigency, and would
very gladly have been on sliore almost any whgre;
but our old pilot told me, that if I would fail to
the southward about two and forty leagues, there
was a little port called Quinchange, where no
European ships ever came, and where we might
consider what was further to be done. According-
ly we weighed anchor the next day,, calling only
twice on sliore by the way to get fresh water. The
country people very courteously fold us roots, tea^
rice, fowls, and other provisions. After five days
fail we came to the port, and landed with un-
speakable joy. We resolved to dispose of our-
selves and effects in any other way possible, than
enter on board that ill-fated vessel more; for no
state can be more miserable than a continued feart
which is a life of death, a confounder of our un-
derstandings, that sets the imagination at work to
form a thousand frightful things that may never
happen. And we scarce slept one night, without
dreaming of halters, yard-arms, or gibbets; of
fighting, being taken, and being killed; nay, so
violent
violent were our apprehensions, that we would
bruise our hands and heads against the sides of the
cabin, as though actually engaged* The story of
the Dutch cruelty at Ampona often came into our
thoughts when awake; and, for my part, I thought
my condition very hard, that, after so many dif-
ficulties, and such signal deliverances, I should be
hanged in my old age,, though innocent of any'
crime that deserved such punishment; but then re-
ligion Xvould seem to represent to me, as though
the voice of it had said, Consider, O man! what
fins you have been formerly guilty of, which now
thou art called to an account for, to expiate with
thy blood! And as to thy innocence, what art
thou more innocent than thy blessed Redeemer
Jesus Christ, who suffered for thy offences, ancf
to whose providence you ought to submit, let
what will' happen? After ttiis natural courage
would inspire me to resist to the last drop of blood*
and sooner die than suffer myself to be taken by,
boorish, rascally. Dutchmen, who had.arts to tor*
ment beyond death itself.
But now, thank kind Heaven, beingasliore, our.
old pilot procured us a lodging and a warehouse
for our goods; it was a little hut with a large
"warehouse joining to it, ail.built with canes, and
pallisadoed round with large ones$ to keep, out
pilfering thieves, which are very numerous in
that country. The magistrates allowed us a little
guard during, the night, and we employed »a senti-
nel with a kind of halbert for threepence* a-day.
The fair or mart, we found, had been over fop
some-time;, however, there remained in, the i*iver
four Junks and two Japan ships, the merchants of
the latter being on shore. In the first place, our-
old pilot brought us acquainted with the missionary *
Roman priests, who were converting the people
to. Christianity: two of them were-reserved, rigid,
C c 3 *" and.
and austere, applying themselves to the work they
came about with great earnestness; but the third,
who was a Frenchman, called father Simon, was
of a freer conversation, not seemingly so serious
and grave, yet no worse Christian than the other
two, one of whom was a Portuguese, and the other
a Genoese. Father Simon,-it seems, was appoint-
ed to go to Pekin, the royal feat of the Emperor
of the Chinese: and he only waited for another
priest, who was ordered from Macao to accom-
pany him. We never met together, but he was
prompting me to keep him company in his jour-
ney: Sir, said he, I will shew you the glorious
things of this mighty Empire, and a city, the city
of Pekin, far exceeding London or Paris, put
them both together. One day in particular, being
at dinner with him, I shewed some inclination to
go 5 which made him press the more upon me and
my partner, to gain our perfect consent. But,
father Simon, said my partner, what satisfaclion
can you have in our company, whom you e/leem as
heretics, and consequently objeels not worthy your
regard} Oh! said he, you may; be as good Catho-
lics in time as those I hope to convert to our re-
ligion. And so, said I, we fiall have you preach-
ing to us all the way, instead of pleasing us with a
description of the country. Sir, said he, however
our religion may be vilified by some people, it is
very certain it neither divests us of good manners
or Christian charity ; and as we are gentlemen, as
such we may converse together, without making
one another uneasy.
But we shall leave him a while, to consider our
ship and the merchandise which we had to dispose
of. There was but very little trade in the place
& where we were; and I was once resolved to ven-
ture to sail to the river Kilam, and so to the city of
Nanquin: but Providence ordered it otherwise,.
by our o!d pilot's bringing a Japan merchant to
us, to fee what goods we had. He immediately
bought our opium, for which he gave us a very
good price in gold by weight, some wedges of
which were about ten or eleven ounces. It came
into my head, that perhaps he might buy the ship
too; and I ordered his interpreter to propose it
to him. He said nothing then, but shrunk up his
shoulders; yet in a few days after he came ac-
companied by a missionary priest, who was his in-
terpreter, with this proposal, That as he had bought
a great quantity of our goods, he had not money
enough to -purchase our J hip; hut if I pleased, he
would hire her with all my men, to go to Japan,
and from thence with another loading to the Philip*
pian islands, the freight of both which he would
very willingly pay to us before; and at their return
to Japan, would buy the ship. Upon this we asked
the captain and his men, if they were willing to
go to Japan; to which they unanimously agreed.
While this was in agitation, the young man my
nephew left to attend me, told me, That as I did
not care to accept this pro/peel of advantage^ he
would manage it for me as I pleased, and render
mea faithful account of his success, which fould
be wholly mine. Indeed I was very unwilling to
part with him : but considering it might be for the,
young man's good, I discoursed my partner about
it,-who, of his own generosity, gave him his share
of the vessel, so that I could do no otherwise than
give him mine; but however, we let him have but
the property of half of it, and reserved a power,
that when we met inEngland, if he had obtained
Cuccese, he should account to us for one-half of
the profits of the ship's freight, and the other
should be his own* Thus having taken a writing
under his band, away he failed to Japan, where
the merchant dealt very honesUy by him, gof him
a licence to come on shore, sent him loaded to*
the Philippines with a Japanese supercargo, from
whence he came back again loaded with European
goods, cloves, and other spiceries. By this voy-
age he cleared a considerable sum os money, which
determined him not to sell his (hip, but to trade
on his own account: so he returned to the Ma-
nillas, where getting acquaintance, he made his
ship free, was hired by the governor privately to
go to Acapulco in America, on the Mexican coast,
with a licence to travel to the great city of Mex-
ico. . This traffic turned out greatly to account,
and my friend finding means to get to Jamaica,
returned nine years after exceeding rich into En#
gland.
In parting with the ship, it comes in course to
consider of those men who had saved our lives*
when in the river of Cambodia: and though, by;
the way, they were a couple of rogues^ who
thought to turn pirates themselves, yet we paid
them what they had- before demanded, and gave
each of them a small sum of money, making the
Englishman a gunner, aud the Dutchman a boat-
swain, with which they were v^ry well contented;
We were now above iooo leagues farther from
home than when at Bengal; All the comfort we
could expect was, that there being another fair
to be kepr in a * month's time, we might not only
purchase all sorts of that country's manufactures,,-
but very possibly find some Chinese junks, or ves-
- sels from Tonquin, to be fold, which would carry
us and our goods wheresoever we pleased* Upon^
these hopes, we resolved to continue *T and to di-
vert ourselves, we took several little journeys in
- the country. About ten days after we parted with
our ship, we travelled to fee the city of Nanquin,.
This city lyes in latitude 30 deg« north of the.
line 1 it is regularly built? and the streets are ex-?
'* '- actly
astly straight, and cross one another, in direct
lines, which sets it out to the greatest advantage.
At our return, we found the priest was come from
Macao that was to accompany father Simon to-
Pekin. That father earnestly solicited me to ac-
company him, and I referred him to my partner.
In short, we both agreed, and prepared accord-
ingly 5 and we were so lucky as to have liberty to
travel ^mong the retinue of one of their Manda-
rines, who is a principle magistrate, and much
reverenced by the people.
We were five and twenty days travelling thro*
this miserable country, infinitely populous, but as,
indifferently cultivated; and yet their pride, is in-
finitely greater than their poverty, insomuch that
the priests themselves derided them. As we passed
by the house of one of tlieir country gentlemen,
two leagues off Nanquin, we had the honour, for-
sooth, to ride with the Chinese squire about two
miles. Never was Don Quixote so exactly imi-
tated, never such a compound of pomp and pover-
ty seen before!
< His habit, made of calico, was ditty, greasy,
and very proper for a Merry Andrew or Scara-
mouch, with all its tawdry trappings, as hanging
sleeves, tassels, £rc, though torn and rent in almost
every xpart: his vest underneath it was no less
dirty, but more greasy, resembling the most ex-
quisite sloven, or greasy butcher. His horse (worse
than Rofinante, of the famous steed of doughty
Hudibras) was a poor starved, decrepit thing, that
would not fell for thirty sliillings in England: and
yet this piece of worshipful pomp was attended
with ten or twelve slaves, who guarded their ma-
ster to his country-seat. We stopped at a little
village for refreshment: and when we came by
the country-seat of this great man, we found him «
sitting under a tree before his door, eating a meft,
of
of boiled rice, with a great piece of garlic in the
middle, and a bag filled with green pepper by him,
and another plant like ginger, together with a
piece of lean mutton in it; this was his Worship's
repast: but pray observe the state of the fool 1
two women slaves brought him his food; which
being laid before him, two others appeared to per-
form their respective offices; one fed him with a
spoon, while the other scrapped off what fell upon
his beard and tassety vest, and gave it to a particu-
lar favourite to eat. And thus we left the wretch
pleased with the conceit of our admiring his mag-
nificence, which rather merited our scorn and de-
testation.
At length we arrived at the great city of Pekinr
accompanied by two servant?, and the old Portu-
guese pilot, whose charges we bore, and who ser-
ved us as an interpreter by the way. We had
scarce been a week at Pekin, but he comes laugh-
ing to us, Ah I Signior Inglise, said he, me some*
thing tell you make your heart glad, but make me
sorry ; for you bring me here 25 days journey, and
now you leave me go back alone: and -which way
Jhall I make my port after, without de ship, with*
out de horse, without pecune? so he called money
in his broken Latin. * He then informed me, that
there was a great caravan of Muscovite and Polish
merchants in the city, who were preparing to set
out for Muscovy by land within fix weeks; and
that he was certain we would take this opportu*
nity, and. consequently that he must go home by
himself. Indeed this news infinitely surprised and
pleased me. Are you certain of this? said 1, Yes^
Sir, said he, me sure it's true. And so he told
me, that having met an old acquaintance of his, an
Armenian, in the street, who was among them, and
» who had come from Astra can, with a design to go
tq Tonquin, but for certain reasons having altered
.,. JhiA.
9 o
his resolution, he was now resolved to go with the
caravan, and to return' by the river Wolga to
Astracan. Well, Signior, said I, don't be discon-
tented about your returning alone; and is by this
means I can find a passage to England, it will be
your own fault if you return to Macao at all. And
so consulting with my partner what was best to
be done, he referred it to me as I pleased, having
our affairs so well settled at Bengal, that if we
could convert the good voyage we had made in
China silks, wrought raw, he would be satisfied to
go to England, and so return to Bengal in the
company's ships. Thus resolved, we agreed, that
if our pilot would go with us, we would bear his
charges either to Mufcow or England; and to
give him in a present the sum os 170 pounds Ster-
ling. Hereupon, we called him in, and told him
the cause of his complaint should be removed, if
he would accompany us with the caravan; and
therefore we desired to know his mind At this
he shook his head, Great long journey, said he, me
no pecune, carry me to Mufcow, or keep me there.
But we soon put him out of that concern, by ma-
king him sensible of what we would give him here
to lay out to the best advantage: and as for his
charges, we would set him safe on shore, God wil-
ling, either in Muscovy, or England, as he plea-
sed, at our xswn charge, except the carriage of
his goods. At this proposal he was like a man
transported, telling us, he would go with us all
the world over; and we made preparations for
our journey; but it was near four months before
all the merchants were ready.
In the. mean time, my partner and the pilot
went express to the port where we first put in,
to dispose of what goods had been left there, while
1 accompanied a Chinese merchant, who was going
to Nanquin, and there bought 29 pieces of damask,
with
4|*
with about 300 more of other fine silks; and by
the time rny partner returned to Pekin, I had them
all carried thither: our cargo.in silks amounted
to 45001. Sterling, wticb, together with tea, sine
calicoes, nutmegs, and cloves loaded 18 camels
for our share, besides what we rocie upon, with
two or three spare horses, and two more loaden
with provisions: the company now was very great,
making about 400 horse, and above 120 men, well
armed and provided. We were of several nations,
among whom were five Scots merchants inhabiting
in Mufcow, and well experienced in trade.
We set out from Pekin the beginning of Febru-
ary our style; and in two days more, we passed
through the gate of the, great China wall, which
was erected as a fortification against the Tartars,
being 108 English miles long. We then entered
a country not near so populous, chiefly under
the power of plundering Tartars, several compa-
nies of whom we perceived riding on poor starved
horses, contemptible as themselves, without order
or discipline. One time our leader for the day
gave us leave to go a hunting. But what do you
think we hunted, only a parcel of slieep, which
indeed exceeded any in the world for wildness and
swiftness; but while we were pursuing this game,
it was our chance to meet with about forty Tar-
tars, who no sooner perceived us, but one of them
blew a horn, at the found of which there soon ap-
peared a troop of forty or fifty more, at about a
mile's distance. Hereupon one of the Scots mer-
chants (who knew their way) ordered us to ad-
vance towards them, and attack them immediately.
As we advanced, they let fly a volley of arrows,
which happily fell a little short of us: this made
us halt a little, to return the compliment with bulT
lets; and then being led up by the bold Scot, we
fired our pistols in their faces, and drew out our
ifwords 1
swords; but there was no occasion; for they flew
like timorous sheep, and only three of them re-
mained, beckoning to the rest to come back. But
our brave commandtr gallops up to them by him-
self, shot one dead, knocks another off his horse,
while the third ran away; and thus ended our
battle with the Tartars. *
We travelled a month more through the emper-
or of China's dominions; and at length coming
to one of their towns about a day and a hall's
journey from the city of Naum,**I wanted to bus
a camel. The person I spoke to would have
brought me one, but, like a fool, 1 must go along
with him, about two miles from the village. My
old pilot and I walked on foot, forsooth, for some*
variety, when coming to the place where the ca-
mels were kept as in a park guarded by Chinese
soldiers, we there agreed and bought one, which
the Chinese man that came with me led along the
road. But we had not gone far, before we were
attacked by five Tartars, mounted on horseback,
two of whom seized the man, took the camel from
him, and rode away, while the other three ap-
proached us, the first of whom suddenly seized
me as I was drawing my sword, the second knock-
ed me down; but my old trusty Portuguese, ta-
king a pistol out of his pockets which I .knew no-
thing of, and coming up to the fellow that struck
me, he, with one hand, pulled him off his horse,
and then shot him dead upon the spot; then taking
his scymitar, he struck at the man that stopt us,
but milling him, cut off one of his horse*s ears,
the pain of which made him throw his rider to the
ground. The poor Chinese, who had led the ca-
TRel, seeing the Tartar down, runs to him, and
seizing upon his pole-axe, wrenched it from his
hands, and knocked his brains out. But there
was another Tartar to deal with, who* seeming;
*, * 'X) d neither
neither inclined to sight, nor to fly, ^and my old
nian having begun to charge his pistol, the very
sight of it struck such a terror into the wretch,
tint away he icoured, leaving my old pilot, ra-
ther my champion and defender, an absolute vic-
tory.
By this time being awakened from my trance, I
began to open my eyes, wondering where I was,
having quite forgot all that passed ; but my fenses
returning, and feeling a great pain in my head,
and feeing the blood was running over my cloaths,
I instantly jumped upon my feet, and grasped my
sword in my hand, with a resolution to take re-
venge; but no enemies now remained, except the
-dead Tartar, with his horse standing by him. The
old man seeing, me recovered, whom he thought
(lain, ran towards me, and embraced me with the
greatest tenderness, at the fame time examining
into my wound, which was far from being mortal;
when we returned to the village, the man demand-
ed payment for his camel, which I refusing, we
brought the cause before a Chinese judge, who
acted with great impartiality: having heard both
sides, he alked the Chinese man that went with
me, whose servant Nhe was? Sir, said he, I am
nobody's, but went with the stranger, at his re-
quest: why then, said the judge, you were the
stranger's servant for the time, and the camel be-
ing delivered to his servant, it is the fame as tho*
delivered to.himielf, and accordingly he must pay
for it. Indeed the cafe was so fairly stated, that
I had nothing to object to it: so having paid for
that I was robbed of, I sent for another, but did not
go myself to fetch it, as I had enough of that sport
before.
The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese
empire, so fortified, as some will tell you, that
millions ©f Tartars cannot batter down their walls;
* by
by which certainly one-might think one of our
cannons would do more execution than all their
legions.
When we were within a day's march of that
city, we had information that the governor had
sent messengers to every part of the road, to in-
form the travellers and caravans to halt, till a
guard was sent to protect them from the numerous
bodies of Tartars that lately appeared about the
city, This news put us into great consternation j
but, obeying the orders, we stopt, and two days
after, there came two hundred soldiers from a
garrison of the Chinese, and three hundred mere
from Naum: thus guarded both in the front and
rear, with our men on the flanks, we boldly ad-
vanced, thinking we were able to combat with ten
thousand Mogul Tartars, if they appeared.
Early next morning, in our march from a little
well situated town called Changu, after having
passed a river, and entered upon a desert of about
15 or 16 miles over, we soon beheld, by a cloud
o£ dust that was raised, that the enemy was ap-
proaching. This much dispirited the Chinese.
My old pilot took notice of it, and called out;."
Hgnior lnglese, those.fellows must be encouraged,
or they will ruin us all; and I am afraid, if the
Tartars attack us, they will all run away. Why
Signior, said I, what shall be done in this cafe *
Done, fays he, why, let fifty of our men advance,
and flank them on each wing. I know the fellows*
will fight well enough in company. We accord-
ingly took his advice, and marched fifty to the
right wing, and the fame number to the left, and
with the rest made a line of reserve, leaving the
last two hundred men to guard the camels, or to*
assist us as occasion required.
Thus prepared, a party of the enemy came for-
ward, viewing pur posture, and-|ra versing the
n d, 2. ground
ground on the front of our line. Hereupon we
ordered the two wings to move on, and give them
a salute with their shot; which accordingly was done.
This put a stop to tneir proceedings; for im-
mediately wheeling off to their left, they all march-
ed away, and we saw not more of them. They
'had undoubtedly given an account to their compa-
nions of what reception they might expect, which
made them so easily give over their enterprise.
When we came to the c-ty of Naum, we re-
turned the governor hearty thanks, and dispersed
a hundred crowns among the soldiers that guard-
ed us. We rested there one day, and then pro-
ceeded on our travels, passing several great rivers
.and desarts; and on the 13th of April, we came
-to the frontiers of Muscovy, the first town of
which was called Argun.
This happy occasion, as I thought, of coming
into a Christian country, made me congratulate
the Sects merchant upon it t he smiled at that,
telling me not to rejoice too soon; for, said he,
except the Russian soldiers in garrison, and a few
inhabitants of the cities upon the road, all the rest
of this country, for above a thousand miles, is in-
. habited by the most ignorant and barbarous Pa-
gans.
We advanced from the river Arguna by mode-
rate journeys, and found convenient garrisons on
the road* filled with Christian soldiers, for the se-
curity of commerce, and for the convenient lod-
, gings of travellers; but the inhabitants of the coun-
try were mere Pagans, worshipping the moon,
fun, and stars. We particularly observed this
idolatry near the r'ver Arguna, at a city inhabited
by Tartars and Russians, called Nerifinkey. Being
curious to fee their way of living, while the cara-
van continued to rest themselves in this city, I
went to one of their villages, where there was to
be
he one of their solemn sacrifices. There I beheld?
upon the flump of an old tree, an idol of wood,
more ugly than the representation of the devil
himself: its head resembled no living, creature:*
its ears were as big and as high as a goat's horns,
a crooked nose, four cornered mouth, and horri-
ble teeth: it was clothed in flieeps lkins, had a;
great Tartar bonnet, with two horns growing-
through it, and was,eight foot high, without feet,
legs, or proportion. Bqtore this* idol there lay
l6 or 17 people, who brought their offerings, and
were "making their prayers, while at a distance
flood three men, and: one bullock, as victims to.*
this ugly monster.
Such stupendous sacrileges as this, in robbing",
the true God of his honour, filled me with the -
greatest astonishment and. reflection; which- loom
turning to rage and fury, I rode up to the image,
and cut in. pieces the bonnet that was upon his
head with my sword, so that it hung down by one.
of the horns, while one of my men that was with.
me, pulled at it by bis sneep-fkin garment* Immedi-
ately an hideous howling and outciy ran through:
the village, and two or three hundred people,
coming about our ears^ we were obliged to fly/
for it*
But I had not done with the monster; for tbe
caravan being to rest three nights in the town, I:
told the Scots merchant what 1 had seen, and that,
Is-was resolved to take four or five men well arm-
ed with me, in order to destroy the idol,- and shew
the people how little reason they had to. trust in-;
a god who could not save himself. At first he
laughed at me, representing the danger of it^ and'
when it was destroyed, what time had we.to preachi
to them better things, whose zeal and ignorance:
was in the highest degree, and both unparalleled?:'
that if IJhould.be taken by,.thjemr;I should heifer*-
D d 3^ veil
ved as a poor Russian, who contemned their wor-
ship; that is, to be stripped naked, and tied to
the top of the idol, there shot at" with arrows till
my body was full o^ them, and then burnt a sa-
crifice to the monster t but, Sir, said he, since
your zeal carries you so far, rather than you
should be alone, I will accompany you, and bring
a stout fellow equal to yourself, if you will, to
assist you in this design: and accordingly he brought
one captain Richardson, who hearing the story,
readily consented; but my partner declined it^
being altogether out of his way: and so we three,
and my man-servant, resolved, to execute this ex-
ploit about midnight; but upon second thoughts
we deferred it to the next night, by reason that
the caravan being to go from thence next morn-
ing, we should be out of the governor's power.
The better to effectuate my design, I procured a
Tartar's fheep-fkin robe, a bonnet, with a bow
and arrows, and every one of us got the like ha-
bits. The first night we spent in mixing combus-
tible matter with aqua-vitæ, gun-powder, &c. ha-
ving a good quantity of tar in a little pot; next
night we came up to the idol about eleven o'clock,,
the moon being up. We found none guarding.it;.*
but we perceived .a light in the house, wherewe
had seen the priests before. One of our men was
for firing the hut, another for killing the people,
and a third for making them prisoners, while the
idol was destroyed. We agreed to the latter; fa
knocking at the door, we seized the first that open-
ed it, and stopping his mouth, and tying his feet,
we left him. We served the other two in the like
manner; and then the Scots merchant set sire to
the composition, which frightened them so much,
that we brought them all away prisoners to their
wooden god. There we fell to work, with him,
daubing him all over witk tar mixed with tallow
- ano!
and brimstone, slopped his eyes, ears, and mouth
full of gun-powder, with a great piece of wild fire
in his bonnet, and environed it with dry forage.
All this being done, we unloosed and ungagged the;
prisoners, and let the idol on fire, which the gun-
powder blowing up, the shape of it was deformed,
rent, and split, which the forage utterly consu-
med; for we staid to see its destruction, led the
ignorant idolatrous people mould have throwa
themselves into the flames* And thus we came
away undiscovered, the morning appearing as bu-
sy among our fellow-travellers, as no body could-
have suspected any other, but that we had been in
our beds all night*
Next morning we set out, and had gone but a
small distance from the city, when there came a
multitude of the people of the country to the
gates of the city, demanding satisfaction of the
Russian governor for insulting their priests, and
burning their great Cham Ghi-Thaungu^ who dwelt
in the fun, and no mortal would violate his image,,
but some Christian miscreants; and being already
no less than thirty thousand strong, they announ-
ced war against him and all hi& Christians.
The governor- assured them he was ignorant of
the matter, and that none of his garrison had been
abroad; that indeed there was a caravan that
went away that morning, and that he would fend
after them to inquire into it; and whoeyer were
the offenders, should be delivered into their hands#
This satisfied them for the present, but the gover-
nor sent to inform us, that if any of us had done
it, we should make all the haste away possible,,
while he lcept them in play as long as he could.
Upon this we marched two days and two nights^
stopping but very little, -till- at last we arrived at
a village called Plothus, and hasted to Jarawena,
another of the Czar's colonies. On the third day,
." ~ having
having entered the desart, and passed the lake cab-
led biiaks User, we beheld a numerous body of
horse on the other fide jof it to the. north, who •
supposed we had passed on that fide of the lake;
but having either found their mistake, or being,
certainly informed of the way we took, they came
upon us rowarjds the dusk of the evening, just as
we had pitched our camp between two little but
very thick woods, wirh a litcle river running be-
fore, our front, and some felled trees, with which'
we covered our rear; a precaution we always
took, and which we had just finished, when the*
enemy, came up. They did not fall on us imme-
diately, but sent three messengers, demanding the-
men who had insulted their priests, and burnt,
their god Cham Chi Thaungu, that they might be
burnt with fire, that if this was complied with, .
they^ would peaceably depart;, but if not, they*
would destroy one and all of us. Our men sta*
red at one another on receipt of this message, but-
Nobody was the word,, as indeed nobody knew it,,
but he who did it. Upon which the leader of the;:
Garavan returned, for answer, That they were
peaceable merchants, who meddled with none of*
their priests,and>gods; and therefore desired them
not to disturb us, and put us to the, necessity of\
defending ourselves. But so far was this from*
satisfying them, „that the next morning, coming*
to our right, they let fly a volley of arrows a~
mong us, which happily did not hurt any, because
we sheltered ourselves behind our baggage. We
expected howevehto come to. a closer engagement j\
but were happily, saved by a cunning fellow, a.
Gossack, who obtaining leave of the Reader to go
out, mounts his horse, rides directly from' our.
Bear, and taking a circuit, comes up to. the- Tar-
tars, as though he had been sent express, and tellss
tfrenra.formal story, that the wretches who hack
burnt:
burnt the Cham Chi Thaungu, were gone to Siheil-
ka, with a resolution to burn the god Shal Isar,
belonging to the Tonguescs. Upon which, belie-
ving this cunning Tartar, who was servant to
our Muscovites, away they drove to Siheilka*
and in less than three minutes were out of our
fight, nor did we ever hear of them more.
When we came to the city of Jarawena, we
rested five days, and then enured into a frightful
•desert, which held us twenty-three days march,
infested with several small companies of robbers,
or Mogul Tartars, who never had the courage
to attack us. After we had passed over this de-
fart, we found several garrisons to defend the ca-
ravans from the violence of the Tartars. In par-
ticular the governor of Adinikoy offered us a
guard of fifty men to the next station, if we ap-
prehended any danger. The people here retained
the,fame paganism and barbarity, only they were
not so dangerous, being conquered by the Musco-
vites. The clothing both of men and women,
is of the skins of beasts, living under the ground
in vaults and caves, which have a communication
with one another. They have idols almost in e-
very family; besides, they adore the fun and stars,
-water and snow; and the least uncommon thing
that happens in the elements, alarms them as
much as thunder and lightning does the unbe-
lieving Jews.
Nothing remarkable occurred in our march
through this country. When we had got through
the desart, after two days further travel, we came
tojenezo, a Muscovite city, on the great river
so called, which, we were told, parted Europe,
from Asia, The inhabitants here were very little
better, though intermixed with the Muscovites *
but the wonder will cease, when I inform my rea-
der of what was observed to me, that the Czar
ratbes
rather converts the Tartars with soldiers than
clergymen, and is more proud to make them faith*
fol subjects, than good Christians.
From this city to the river (Jby, we travelled
over a pleasant, fruitful, but very uncultivated
country, for want of good management and peo-.
pie, and those few are mostly pagans. This is
the place where the Muscovite criminals are ba- -
nifhed to, if they are not put to death. The next
city we came to, was the capital city of Liberia,*
called Tobolfki, when, having been almost seven
months on our journey, and winter drawing on
fcpace, my partner and I consulted about our par-
ticular affairs, in /what manner we should dispose
of ourselves. We had been told of fledges and
rein-deer to carry us over the snow in the winter
season, the snow being frozen so hard, that the
sledges can run upon the surface without any dan-
ger of going down. As I was bound to England,
I now behoved either to go with the caravan to
Jeroiiaw, from thence west to Narva, and the
gulf of Finland, and so by land or sea to Den-
mark; or else I-must leave the caravan at a little
town on the Dwiria, and so to Archangel, where
I was certain of shipping either to England, Hol-
land, or Hamburgh, line night I happened to
get into the company of an illustrious but bant-
slied prince, whose company aad virtues were such
as made me propose to him a method how he might
obtain his liberty. My dear friend, said he, as I
am here happily free from my miserable greatness,
with all its attendants of pride; ambition, avarice,
and luxury; if I foould escape from this place,
these pernicious seeds may again revive, to my last-
ing disquietude; therefore let me remain in a blefi
fed confinement, for I am but flejlo, a mere man,
with passions and affections as such; 0 be not my
friend and tempter too I Struck dumb with sur-
pdso.
prise, I stood silent a while, nor was he in less dis-
order ; by which perceiving he wanted to give vent
to his mind, I desired him to consider of it, and so
withdraw. But about two hours after he came to
my apartment: Dear friend, said he, though 1 can-
not consent to accompany you, I Jliall have this sa-
tisfaction in parting, that you have me an honefl
man, still; but as a testimony of my affeclion to
you, be pleased to accept this present of sables.
In return for this compliment, I lent my ser-
vant next morning to his Lordship, 'with a small
present of tea, two pieces of China damask, and
four little wedges of gold: but he only accepted
the tea, one piece of damalk, and a piece of gold,
for the curiosity of the Japan stamp that was upon
it. Not long after, he sent for me, and told me,
That what he had refused lrmself, he hoped upon
nis account I would grant to another, whom he
should name; In short, it was his only son, who
was abou" 200 miles distance from him, on the
other side of the Oby, whom he said he would
send for, if 1 gave my consent. This I soon com-
plied with: upon which he sent his servants next
day for his son, who returned in twenty days time,
bringing seven horses loaded with valuable furs..
At night die young lord Was conducted incognito
into t>ur apartment, where his father presented
him to me. We then concerted the best ways for
travelling, and after having bought a considerable
quantity of sables, black fox skins, fine erminies,
&c. (which I fold at Archangel at a good piece*)
\ve set out from this city the beginning of June,
making a small caravan, being about thirty-two
Horses and camels, of which 1 represented the head.
My young lord had with him a very faithfui Sibe-
rian servant, well acquainted with the roads: we
ihunned the principal towns and cities, as Tumen,
Soli Kamofkbi, and several others, by reason of
their
their strictness in examining, travellers, lest any of
the banished persons of distinction should escape.
Having passed the river Kama, we carne to a city
on the European side, called Soloy Komofkoi,
where we found the people mostly Pagans as be-
fore. We then passed a desart of about two hund-
red miles over; but in other places, it is near
seven hundred. In passing this wild place, we were
beset by a troop of men on horseback, and about
five and forty men armed with bows and arrows.
At first they looked earnestly on us, and then pla-
ced themselves in bur way. We were above six-
teen men, and drew up a little line before our
camels. My young lord sent out his Siberian ser-
vant to know who they were; but when he ap-
proached them, he neither knew a word they said,
nor would they admit him to come near them at
his peril, but prepared to moot him. At his re-
turn he told us he believed them to be Calmuck
Tartars, and that he thought there were more of
them upon the desart. This was but a small com-'
fort to us; yet feeing a little grove about a quar-
ter of a mile's distance, we moved to it, by the
old Portuguese pilot's advice, without meeting
with any opposition. Here we found a marshy
piece of ground, and a spring of water running
into a little brook on one side, which joined ano-
ther like it a little farther off, and these two form-
ed the head of the river called Writfka. As soon*
as we arrived, we went to work, cutting down
great arms off the trees, and laying them hanging
(not quite off) from one tree to another. Jn this
situation we waited the motions of the enemy,
without perceiving any advancement they made
towards us. About two hours "before night, be-
ing joined by some others, in all ^bout fourscore
horse, among whom we fancied were some wo-
men, th^y came upon us with great fury. We
fired
fired without ball, calling to them in the Russian
tongue to know their business; but they, either
not knowing, or seeming not to understand u$f
came directly to the wood-side, not considering
that we were so fortified, as that they could not
t>reak in. Our old pilot the Portuguese proved
both our captain and engineer, and desired us not*
to fire, till they came within pistol-shot; and when,
he gave the word of command, then to take the
surest-aim: but he did not bid us give fire, till
they were within two pikes length of us, and then
we killed fourteen of them, wounded several, as
also their horses, having every one of us loaded
our pieces with two or three bullets at least. So
much were they surprised at our undaunfedness,
that they retired about a hundred roods of us. In
the mean while, we loaded our pieces again, and
sallying out, secured four or five of their horses,
. whole riders we found were killed, and perceived
them to be Tartars. About an hour after, they
made another attempt, to fee where they might
break in; but finding us ready, to receive them^
they retired.
AR that night we wrought hard, in strengthen-
ing our situation, and barricading the entrance*
into the woods; but when day-lignt came, wehad
a very unwelcome discovery; for the enemy be-
ing encouraged by their assistance, had set up ele-
ven or twelve tents in form of a camj*, about three
quarters of a mile from us. I must confess, I was
never more concerned in my life, giving myself
and all that I had over for lost. And my partner
declared, that as the loss of his goods would be
his ruin, before they should be taken from him, *
he would fight to the last drop of iiis blood. As
we could not pretend to force our -way, we had
recourse to a stratagem; we kindled a large fire,
^which burnt all night $ and no sooner 'was it dark,
E e + bu{
but we pursued our journey towards the pole, or
north star, and travelling all night, by fix o'clock
in the morning we came to a Russian village, cal-
led Kertza, and from thence came to a large town
named Ozonoys, where we heard that several
troops of Calmuck Tartars had been abroad upon
the desart, but that we \y#re past all danger. In
five days after we came to> Veuslima, upon the ri-
ver Witzedga; from thence we came to Lawren-
Ikoy, on the third of July, where, providing our-
ijplves wkb two luggage boats and a conve-
nient bark, we embarked the seventh, and arrived
at Archangel the eighteenth, after a year, five
months, and three days journey, including the
.eighth months and odd days at Tobolfki. We
came from Archangel the twentieth of August in
the fame year, and arrived at Hamburgh the thir-
tieth of September. Here my partner and I made
a very good sale of our goods, both those of Chi-
na and Siberia; when, dividing our effects, my
share came to 3475 1. 17 s. 3 d. after all the losses
/we had sustained, and charges we had been at.
Here the young Lord took his leave of me, in or-
der tp go to the court of Vienna, not only to seek
.protection, but to correspond with his fathers
friends. After we had staid four months in Ham-
burgh, I went from thence over land to the Hague,
•where, embarking in the jacket, I arrived in Lon-
don the tenjth of January 1705, after ten years
* and toitfe months absent from England,

Chap, I. Of SO LITUD E.
TJOw ever solitude is looked upon as a restraint
J | to the pleasures of the world, in company
and conversation, yet it is a happy slate of ex-
emption from a lea of trouble, an inundation of.
vanity and vexation, of confusion and disappoint-
ment. While we enjoy ourselves, neither the
joy nor sorrow of other men affect: us: we are
then at liberty, with the voice of our soul, tc*
speak to God. By this we shun such frequent tri-
vial discourse, as even becomes an obstruction to*
virtue; and how often do we find, that we had
reason to wish we had not been in company, or
said nothing when we were there? for either we
offend God by the impiety of our discourse, or lay
ourselves open to the violence of designing peo-
ple byour unguarded expressions; and frequently
feel the coldness and treachery of pretended friends,.,
when once involved in trouble and affliction; of
such unfaithful intimates si should fay enemies)
who rather by false innuendoes would accumulate
miseries upon us, than honestly assist us when suf-
fering under the hard hand of Adversity. But in;
a state of solitude, when our tongues cannot be
heard, except by the great Majesty of heaven,
how happy are we, in the blessed enjoyment of
conversing with our Maker J It is then we make
him our friend, which sets us above the envy and
contempt of wicked men. When a man converses
with himself, he is sure that he does not converse
wish an enemy. Our retreat should be to good
company, and good books. I mean not by soli-
E e 2 tude,,
tude, that a man should retire into a cell, a de-
sart, or a monastery: which would be altogether
an useless and unprofitable restraint: for as men
are formed for society, and have an absolute ne-
cessity and dependence upon one another 5 4b there
is a retirement of the foul, with which it.converses
in heaven, even in the midst of men; and indeed
1X0 man is mora fit to speak freely, than he who
can, without any violence to himself, refrain hi&
tongue, or keep silence altogether. As to reli-
gion, it is by this the foul gets acquainted with
the hidden mysteries of the holy writings; here
file finds those flood of tears, in which good men
wash themselves day and night, and only makes a
visit to God, and his holy angels. In this con-
versation the truest peace and most solid joy are
to be found; it is a continual feast of contentment
an earth* and the means of attaining everlasting
happiness in heaven.
Chap. II. Of HONESTY.
Honesty is a virtue beloved by good men, *n<f
pretended to by all persons. In this there are se-
veral degrees; to pay every man his own, is the
•common law of honesty; but to do good to all
mankind, is the chancery law of honesty: and this
chancery-court is in every manas breast, where
Iiis conscience is a lord chancellor. Hence it isf
that a miser, though he pays every body their
own, cannot be an honest man, when he does not
discharge the good offices that are incumbent
on a friendly, kino', and generous person; for,
faith the prophet Isaiah, chap, xxxii. ver. 7, 8.
The instruments of a churl are evil: he devise th
wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words,,
even when the needy speaketh right. But the libe-
ralsoul deviseth liberal things^ and by liberal things:
shall
Jball he /land. It is certainly honesty to do every
thing the law requires ; but should we throw eve-
ry poor debtor in prison till he has paid the ut-
most farthing, hang every malefactor without
mercy, exact, the penalty of every bond, and the
forfeiture of every indenture, this would be down-
right cruelty, and not honesty: and it is contrary
to that general rule, To do to another that which
you would have done unto you. Sometimes necessi-
ty makes an honest man a knave: and a rich man
an honest man, because he has no occasion to be
a knave. The trial of honesty is this: Did! you:
ever want bread, and had your neighbour's loaf
in keeping; and would starve, rather than eat it?
Were you ever arrested, having in your custody
another man's cash, and would rather go to goal,
than break it? if so, this indeed may be reckoned'
honesty. For King Solomon tells us, that a gooes
name is better than life, and is a -precious ohtt*
'ment, and which when a man has once l$ffy he has
nothing left worth keeping.
Chap. IIL Of suffering AFFLICTIONS.
Affections are common to all mankind ; and'
whether they proceed from losses, disappointments,
or the malice of men, they often bring their ad-
vantages along with them : for*this shews man theJ
vanity and deceitfulness of this life, and is an oc-
casion of rectifying our measures, and bringing
us to a more model! opinion of ourselves :• it tells
us, how necessary the assistance of divine grace is*
unto us, when life itself becomes a burden, and
death even desirable: but when the-greatest op-
pression comes upon us, we must have recourse to
patience, begging of God to give us that virtue;
and the more composed we are under any trouble,
the more commendable is our wisdom, and* the:
E e 3 larger
larger will be our recompense* Let the provo*
cation oe what it will, whether from a good-na-
tured and conscientious, or a wicked, perverse,
and vexatious man; all this we should take as
from the over-ruling hand of God, as a punish-
ment for our fills. Many times injured innocence
may be abused by false oaths, or the power of
wicked, jealous, or malicious men; but we often
find it, like the palm, rife the higher, the more
it is depressed; while the justice of God is eminent-
ly remarkable in punishing those, one way or o-
Slier, who desire to endeavour to procure the
lownfal of an innocent man: nor does God fail 
comforting an afflicted person, who with tears and
prayers solicits the throne of Heaven for deliver-
ance and protection. David fays, that his foul
<was full of trouble j and his life drew near unto the
grave. But certainly David's afflictions made him
eminently remarkable, as particularly when pur-
sued by King Saul, and hunted as a partridge o-
ver the mountains. But one thing which stands
by innocence, is the love of God; for were we
to suffer disgrace, nay, an ignominious death it-
self, what consolation does our innocence procure
at our latest conflict, our last moments I
Chap, fy. Of the immorality of conversation^ anal
the vulgar errors of behaviour*
As conversation h a great part of human trap*
pinessT so it is a pleasant sight to behold a sweet-
tempered man, who is always fit for it; to fee an
air of humour and pleasantness sit ever upon hi$
brow, and even something angelic in his very
countenance: whereas, if we observe a designing:
fcian, we shall find a mark of involuntary sadness-
break in upon his joy, and a certain insurrection
in
in the foul, the natural concomitant of profligate
principles.
They err very much, who think religion, or a
strict morality, discomposes the mind, and renders
it unfit for conversation; for it rather inspires us
to innocent mirth, without such a counterfeit joy
as vitious men appear with; and indeed wit is as
consistent with religion, as religion is with good
manners; nor is there any thing in the limitation
of virtue and religion that should abate the plea-
sures of this world, but on the contrary rather
serves to increase them.
On the other hand, many men, by their own vice%
and. intemperance, disqualify themselves- for con-
versation. Conversation is immoral, where the
discourse is indecent, immodest, scandalous, slan-
derous, and abusive. How great is their folly,
and how much do they expose themselves, when^
they afiront their best friend, even God himself,
who laughs at the fool when his fear cometh?
The great scandal atheistical and immoral dis*,
course gives to virtue, ought methinks, to be pu-
nished by all good magistrates: make a man once
cease to believe a God, and he has nothing left
to limit his foul. How incongruous is it to good
government, that a man shall be punished for
drunkenness, and yet have liberty to affront, and
even deny the Majesty of heaven? when if, even
among men, one gives the lie to a gentleman in
company, or perhaps speaks an affronting word,
a quarrel will ensue, and a combat, and perhaps
murder be the consequence: at the least, he will
prosecute him at law with the utmost virulence
and oppression.
The next thing to be refrained, is obscene dis-
course, which is the language only of proficients
in debauchery, who never repent but in a goal of
hospitals and whose carcases relish no better than*
their
their discourse, till the body becomes too nasty
for the foul to stay any longer in it. v
, Nor is false talking to be less avoided; for ly-
ing is the sheep's cloathing hung upon the wolf's
1 back: it is the Pharisee's prayer, the whore's
buss, the hypocrite's paints the murderer's smile,,
the thief's cloak, it is Joab's embrace, and Judah's
- kifo; in a word, it is mankind's darling finr and
the devil's distinguishing character. Some add lies,
% to lies, till it not only comes to be improbable,
but even impossible too: others lie for gain, to de-
ceive, delude, and betray: and a third lies for sport,,
or for fun. There are other liars, wro are per-
sonal and malicious; who foment differences, and
carry .tales from one house to another, in order
to gratify their own envious tempers, without
any regard to reverence or truth.
Chap, V. Of the present state of religion in the-
ivorla.
I doubt, indeed, there is much, more devotion:
than religion in the world, more adoration than
supplication, and more hypocrisy than sincerity i
and it is very melancholy to consider, what num^-
befs of people there are furnished with the powers
of reason and gifts of nature, and yet abandoned'
to the grossest ignorance and depravity. But it:
would be uncharitable for us to imagine (as some
Papists abounding with too much ill-nature, the
only scandal to religion, do) that they will cer-
tainly be in the state of damnation after this life j;*
for how can we think it consistent with the mer-
cy and goodness of an infinite Being, to damn-
those creatures, when he has not furnished them
with the *ight of his gospel; or how can such proud,,
conceited, and cruel bigots^ prescribe rules to the,
justice and mercy of God?;
We
We are told by some people, that the great
image which King Nebuchadnezzar set up to be a-
dored by his people, held the representation of
the sun in its right hand, as the principal object
of adoration. But to wave this discourse of hea-
thens, how many self-contradicting principles are
tliere held among Christians? and how do we
doom one another to the devil, while all profess
to worship the fame Deity, arid do expect the
fame salvation.
When I was at Portugal, there was held at that
time^the court of justice of the inquisition. All
the criminals were carried in procession to the
great church, where eight of them were habited1
in gowns and caps of canvass, whereon the tor-
ments of hell were displayed, and they were con-
demned and burnt for crimes against the catholic
faith and blessed virgin.
I am sorry to make any reflection upon Christi-
ans; but indeed in Italy the Roman religion seems
the most cruel and mercenary upon earth: and a
very judicious person, who travelled thro* Italy
from Turkey, tells us, "That there is only the
44 face and outward pomp of religipn th^re; that
u the church protects murderers and assassins, and
u then delivers the civil magistrates over to Sa*
44 tan for doing justice; interdicts whole king-.
44 dbms, and shuts up the churches for want of
4* paying a few ecclesiastical dues, and so puts a
u stop to religion for want of their money; that
44 the court of Inquisition burnt two men for
44 speaking dishonourably of the blessed virgin:
44 and the missionaries of China tolerated the wor-
44 shipping the devil by their new eon vert s: that
44 Italy was the theatre, where religion was the
li grand opera; and that the Popish clergy were *
*4 no other than the stage-players."
As to religion in Poland, they deny Christ to
Tae
be the Messiah, or that the Messiah has come m
the flessi. And as to their Protestants, they are
the followers of Lælious Socinus, who denied our
Saviour's divinity; and have no concern about
the divine inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
In Muscovy their churches are built of wood,
and indeed they have but wooded priests, though
of the Greek church: they pray as much to St.
Nicholas, as Papists do to the Virgin Mary, for
protection in all .their difficulties and afflictions.
* As to Lutherans, they only differ from the Ro-
mans in believing confubstantiation, instead of
tranfubstantiation; but, like them, they are much
pleased with the external gallantry and pomp, „
more than the true and real practice of it,
, In France I found a world of priests, the streets
every where crouded with them, and the churches,
full of women; but surely never was a nation so:
ftjll of blind guides, so ignorant of religion, and
even as void of morals, as those people who con-,
fess their fins to them*
Does it not seem strange, that while all mer*
own the Divine Being, there should be so many
different opinions as to the manner of paying him
obedience in the Christian church? 1 know not,
\yhat reason to assign for this, except it be theif.
different capacities and faculties.
And indeed, upon this account, we have per-
ceived in all Christian countries what mortal feuds,
have been about religion: what wars and blood-j
shed have molested Europe, till the general pacific
cation of the German troubles at the treaty of,
Westphalia; and since those times, what persccu?*
tion in the lame country among the churches of.
the Lutherans: and should I take apj-ofpectat.
home, what unhappy divisions are between Christi-
ans in this kingdom, about Episcopacy and Pres-
bytery, the church of England men and the dis-
"V seaters j
senters 5 opposing one another like St. Paul and
St. Peter, even to the face; that is, they carry
on the dispute to the utmost extremity.
It might be a question, why there are such dif-
ferences in religious points, and why these breaches
mould be more hot and irreconcilable? All the
answer 1 can give to this, is, that we inquire more
concerning the truth of religion, than any other
nation in the world; and the anxious concern we
have about Jt, makes us jealous of every opsnion,
and tenacious of our own: and this is not because
we are more furious and,rash than other people;
but the truth is, we are more concerned about
them, and being sensible that the scripture is the
great rule of faith, the standard for life and doc-
trine, we have recourse to it ourselves, without
submitting to any pretended infallible judge upon
£arth.
There is another question, pertinent to the for-
mer, and that is, what remedy can we apply to
this malady? And to this I must negatively an-
swer, Not to be less religious, that we may dif-
fer the less. This is striking at the very root of*
all religious differences; for certainly, were they
to be carried on with a peaceable spirit, willing
to be informed, our variety of opinions would npjt
have the name of differences; nor should we sepa-
rate in communion of charity, though we did not
.agree in several articles of religion.
Nor is there a less useful question to start,
namely, where will our unhappy religious differ-
ences end? To which, I hope, I may answer, in
Heaven; there all unchristian and unbrotherly
differences will find a period; rfiere. we shall em-
brace many a (inner, that here we think it a dis-
honour to converse with; and perceive many a
heart we have broken here with censures, re-
proaching, and revilings, made whole again by
the
the balm of the same Redeemer's blood. Here
we shall perceive there have been other flocks
than those of our fold; that those we have excom-
municated, have been taken into that superior
communion: and, in a word, that those contra-
dicting notions and principles, which we thought
inconsistent with true religion, we shall then find
reconcilable to themselves, to one another, and
to the fountain of truth. If any man ask me, why
our differences cannot be ended upon earth; I
answer, were we all thoroughly convinced, that
then they would be reconciled, we would put an
end to them before; but this is impossible to be
done: for as mens certain convictions of truth
are not equal to one another, or to the weight or
fignificancy of such veracity; so neither can a ge-
neral effect of this affair be expected on this fide
of the grave.
Before I conclude tnis chapter, I shall beg leave
to discourse a little of the wonderful excellency
of negative religion and negative virtue* ,The
latter sets out like the Pharisee, with, God, I thank
thee; it is a piece of religious pageantry, the hy-
pocrite's hope: and, in a word, it,is positive vice:
for ft is either a mask to deceive others, or a mist
to deceive ourselves. A man that is clothed with
negatives, thus argues: lam not such a drunkard
as my landlord, such a thief as my tenent, such a
swearer as his neighbour: neither am I a cheat,
an atheist, a rakish fellow, or a highwayman: no!
I-live a sober regular retired life: I am a good
man, I go to church, God I thank thee. Now,
though a man boasts of his virtue in contradiction
to the vices mentioned, yet a person had better
have them altogether^ than the man himself; for
he is so full of himself, so persuaded that he is
good and religious enough already, that he has no
Noughts of any thing, except it be to pull off his
hai
hat \o God Almighty now and then, and thank
htm, that he has no occasion for him; and has the
vanity to think t*iat his neighbours mull imagine
well of him too.
The negative man, though he is no drunkard,
is yet intoxicated with theprideof his own worths
a good neighbour and peace-maker in other*fami-
lies, but a tyrant in his own: appears in church
for a show, but never falls upon his knees in his
closet; does all his alms before menv to be seen
of them ; 'eager in the duties of the second table,
but regardless of the first; appears religious, to
be taken notice of by men, but without inter-'
course or communication between God and his
own foul: Fray, what is the man? or what com-
fort is there of the life he lives? he is insensible
of f.urh, repentance, and a Christiati mortified
life; in a word, he is perfectly a stranger to the
essential part of religion,
Let us for a while enter into the private and
retired part of his conversation: What notions
has he of his mifpent hours, and of the progress,
of time to the great centre and gulf of life, eter-
nity? does he know how to put a right value on
time, -or esteem the life blood of his foul,-as it
really is, and ac~hin all the moments of it, as one
that must account for them ? If then you can form
"an equality between what be can do; and what he
ihall receive; less can it be founded upon his ne-
gative virtue, or what he has forborn to do, and
if neither his negative nor positive piety can be
equal to the reward, and to the eternity that re-
ward is to last for, what then is to become of the
-Pharisee,when he is to bejudged by the sincerity
of his repentance, and rewarded according to the
infinite grace of God, with a state of blessedness
to an endless eternity .\ „ .. .*•-•
When the negative man converses, with the in-
. -. . Ff visible
visible world, he is filled with as much dread and
horror as Felix, when St. Paul reasoned to him
of temperance, righteousness, and of judgment to
come: For Felix, though a great philosopher, of
great power and reverence, was a negative man,
and he was made sensible by the apostle, that as a
life of virtue and temperance was its own reward,
by giving a healthy body, a clear head, and a com-
posed life; so eternal happiness must proceed from
another spring; namely, the infinite unbounded
grace of a provoked God, who having erected a
righteous tribunal, Jesus Christ would separate
such as by faith and repentance he had brought
home and united to himself by the grace of adop-
tion, and on the foot of his having laid down his
life as a ransom for them, had appointed them to
salvation, when all the philosophy, temperance
•and righteousness in the world besides had been
ineffectual. And this, I fay, it was that made
Felix, this negative man, tiemble.
Chap, VI. Of liflning to the voice 'of Providence.
The magnificent and wife King Solomon bids'
us'cry after knowledge, and lift up our voice for
understanding; by which is meant, religious know*
ledge; for it follows: Then Jl?alt thou understand
the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of
God, By which undoubtedly he meant, to inquire
after every thing that he has permitted us to know,
and not to search into those ways, that are un-
searchable, and are effectually locked up from our
knowledge. Now, as liftning to the voice of -pro-
vidence is my present subject, I intend, in the first
place, to write to those who own, i. That there
is a God, a first great moving cause of all things,
and eternal power, prior, and consequently siir
perior to all .created power or being. 2. That
this
this eternal power, which is God, is the sovereign
creator and governor of heaven and earth..
To avoid all needless distinctions, what persons
in the Godhead exercise the creating, and what
the governing power, I offer that glorious text,
Psal. xxxiii, 6. where the whole Trinity-is intit-*
led to the whole creating work; and therefore^
in. the next place, I shall lay down these two pro-
positions.
I< That the eternal God guides by his providence"
the whole universe^ which was created by his
power*
IL That this providence manifests a particular
care over, and concern in the governing and
directing manr the most noble creature upon
earth*
It is plain, that natural* religion proves the
first* by intimating the Necessity of a providence
girding and governing the world, from the con--
sequence of the wisdom, justice, prescience, and
goodness of the Almighty Creator: for otherwise*
it would be absurdto think, that God should cre-
ate a world, without any care or providence over
it, in guiding the operations of nature,* so as to-
preserve the order of his creation.
Revealed religion gives us a light into the care;
artd-eoncern of his providence, by the climafeV
being made habitable, the creatures subjected and
made nouri(hingf and all vegetative life made me--
dicinal; and t all this for the fake of man, who is
made viceroy to the King of the earth. The short-
description I shall give of providence is this: '1 bat
it is that operation of the power, of the Avisdbm,
Justice, and goodness of God, t>y which, he influen-
ces, ^-governs, and; directs, not: only the means,
but the events of all things^ which concern us in*
F f 2 this
$his sublunary world; the sovereignty of whicR
we ought always to reverence, obey its motions,
observe its dictates, and listen to its voice. The'
prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth hin>
self; that is, as 1 take it, there is a secret provi-
dence intimates to us, that some danger threatens,
if we strive not to shun it.
. The fame day that Sir John Hot ham kept out
Hull against the royal martyr King Charles I. the
fame day Sir John Hotham was put to death by
the parliament for that very action; the fame day
that the king himself signed the warrant for the
execution of the Earl of Stafford, the same day
of the month was he barbarously murdered by the
blood thirsty Oliverian Grew: and the fame day
that King James the Second came to the crowa
against the bill of exclusion, the fame day he was
voted abdicated by the parliament, and the throne
filled with King William and Queen Mary.
The voice of signal deliverance from sudden;
dangers, is not only a }ust call to repentance* but
a caution against falling into the like danger} but
such who are utterly careless of themselves after,,
ffjew a lethargy of the worst nature, which seems,
tome to.be a kind of practical atheism, drat least
a living in a contempt of Heaven, when he re-
ceives good at the hand of his Maker, but is un-
concerned from whence incomes, or to thank the
bountiful hand that gave it; neither when he re-
ceives evil% does it alter his manner of life, or
'bring him to any state of humiliation.
We have a remarkable story of two soldiers be>
ing condemned to death in Flanders, ..The gene-
rai being prevailed upon to spare one of them-,,

We read in the holy writings, how God speaks
to men, by appearance of angels, or by dreams
and visions of the night. As God appeared to A*
braham, Lot, and Jacobs so angels have appear-
ed to many in other cafes, as to Manoah and Iris
wife, Zachariah, the virgin Mary, and to the a-
pestles; others have been warned in a dream, as
king Abimelech, the false prophet Balaam, and
many others.1
. It is certainly a very great and- noble inquiry,
what we shall be after this life? for there is scarce
a doubt, that there is a place reserved for the re-
ception of our, souls after death: for if we are to
be, we must have a where, which the scriptures
assert by the examples of Dives and Lazarus. The
doctrine of spirits was long believed before our
Saviour's time; for when the disciples of the bles-
sed Jesus perceived our Saviour walking on the
sea, they were much surprised, as though they

* Abundance of strange notions possessed me, when:
I was in the desolate island; especially on a moop-
.fhine night, when every bush seemed a man, and
every tree a man on horseback. When I crept
into the dismal cave, where the old goat lay expi-
ring, whose articulate groans even resembled those
of a man, how was I surprised! my blood chilled
in my veins, a cold sweaty dew set on my fore-
head, my hair stood upright, and my joints, like
Belflia&fcar's knees, struck against one another.
And indeed, though I afterwards found what it
wast the remains of this surprise did not wear off"
for a great while; and I had frequently returns
of those vapours on different occasions,, and some-
times without any occasion at alL
One night, after having seen some appearance
in the air, as I had just lain down in my bed^ one
of my feet pained me4; after that came a numb-
ness, succeeded with a tinkling in my blood; when*
on a sudden I thought something alive lay upon?
me, from my knee to above half my leg. Upon
"* this I flung myself out of bed where I thought the
creature lay: but finding nothing, Lord deliver me
from an evil spirit, said I, what can this he? When.
I lighted a candle, I could perceive no living crea-
ture in the place with me but the poor parrot,,
who being frighted, cried out, Hold your tonguer
and, What's the matUr with you}'which words I
taught him, by saying so to him', When he made
such screaming noises as I did not like, Lord, said

How intelligences are given or received, we do*
iiot know; nor are we sensible how they are con*
veyed from spirits unembodied, to ours that are-
in life; or on the contrary from us to them:, the
latter certainly is done without the help of-.the:
organs, and the former is conveyed by the under-
standing, and the retired faculties of the foul. i

Dreams of old were the ways by which Gocfc
himself was pleased to warn men what services to
perform, and what to shun. Joseph was directed-
of God in a dream to go to Egypt j: arjdtso were:
she wise^men warned in a dream to depart into*
their own country another way, to avoid the fury
of Herod. 1 am not like those who think dreams
are the mere dofings of a delirious ;head, or the*
relics of a day's perplexities or pleasures 5 but,,
on the contrary, I must beg leave to fay, I never
met with any capital mischief in my life, but 1 had
some notice of it by a dream; and had I not been^
a thoughtless unbelieving creature, I might have
taken many a warning, arid avoided many of the-;
evils I afterwards fell into^ merely by total ne*
glect of those dreams,
I was
I was once present at a dispute between a lay-
man and a clergyman, upon the subject: of dreams..
The first thought no regard should be given unto>
them: that their communication from the* invisi-
ble to the visible world was a mere chimera ; with-
out any solid foundation. For, i. said he, if
dreams were from the agency of any prescient
being, the motives would be more direct:, and the
discoveries more plain \ and not by allegories and
emblematic fancies, expressing things imperfect and
obscure, 2. Since, with the notice of evil, there
was not a power given to. avoid it, it is not likely
to proceed from a spirit, but merely fortuitous.
3. That the inconstancy of such notices, in cafes
equally important, proves they did not proceed
from any such agent. 4. That as our most dis-
tinct dreams had nothing in them of any, signifi-
eancy, it would be irrational and vain to think
that they came from heaven. And, 5 that as men
were not always thus warned or supplied with
notice of good or evil, so all men are not alike^
supplied with them; and what reason could we
give, why one man or one woman fhouldnot have
the same hints as another.
To all this, the clergyman gave answer; 1. That,
as to the signification of dreams, and the objec-
tions against them as being dark and doubtful^
they are expressed generally by hieroglyphical
representations, similies, allusions, and figurative
emblematic ways, by which means, for want of
interpretation, the thing was not understood, and
consequently the evil not shunned. 2. That we
charge God foolishly, to say, that he has given
the notice of evil without the power to avoid it;
for if any one had not power to avoid the evil, it-
was no notice to him; and it was want of giving
due heed to that notice, that first men neglected
themselves, and then charged the Judge of all the
'earth.
earth with injustice, 3. *That we ought not to
find fault with the inconstancy, of these notices,
hut rather with our weak, understandings, by pre-
tending dreams were not to be regarded^ and ne-
gligent when the voice really spoke to us for our
good* Jt is a mistake to fay, dreams have np im-
pqrt at all: we-nrght with more reason have said,
none that we could perceive the reason of, owing
to our blindness and supine negligence, too secure
at one time, and too much alarmed at another; so
that the spirit* which we might be said to be con-
versing with in a dream, was constantly and equal-
ly kind and careful ;*but our powers are not al-
ways in the fame state of action, not equally at-
tentive to, or retentive to the. hints that were,
given. And, 5. to answer the last question^, why
people are not equally supplied? This seemed -to.
be? no question; for Providence itself might havft
some share in the direction .of it, and then ^thafc
Providence might be limited by a superior direc-^
•tion; That as to. the converse of spirits, he could
i}ot call it a stated^ converse; such a thing there
wa^ by why there was so much of }ty ajnd na
more,, w&s none of his business, and that no, such
discovery had ever yet been made to. marikinoV
Nor.were we t0 imagine leiV of waking dreams*
trances, visions, ^noises, hints, Jmpulses*. and. all
the^yaking testimonies of an invisible wqitld,, and
qf the communication thsit there is^ betw.een us
apd them, which commonly entertain us with our
eyes open. * • *
Onetime my fancy.soared on high, to see what*
discoveries I- could make in those.clearer regions.
/I found that such immense bodies as the fun, starsr
planets, and moon, in the great circle of the low-
er heaven, are far from being found in the study
of nature on the surface of the earth. Here I la^w
inany things that we cafi entertain little or.no
not: or
notion of in a state'of common life, and the emp-
tiness of our notion, that the planets are habita-
ble worlds, that is, created like ours for the sub*
fislence and existence of man and beast, and the
preservation of the vegetative and sensitive life:
iro, no; this is, I allure you, a world of spirits j
for here I saw a clear demonstration of Satan beings
the prince of the power of the air, keeping his
court or camp, with innumerable angels to attend
him; but his power is not so great as we imagine,
he can tempt us to the crime, but cannot force us
to commit its Humattum esil peccare. Neither has
the devil power to force the* world into a rebellion
against Heaven*, though his legions are employed'
among savage nations to set up their master for a
god, who make the Heathens either worship him
in person, or by his representatives, idols, and
monsters, with the cruel sacrifices of human blood.
Now, as to the limitations of the devil's power,
you must understands that as there are numbers
of evil spirits employed in mischief, so there are1
numbers of good angels sent from the higher and
blessed abodes to disconcert and oppose their mea~
sures j and this every Christian, I hope, believes,
when he prays to God, the Father of spirits, to
give his angels charge over him while he slumber-
eth and fleepeth. For if these preventing powers,
the devil was not restrained, the earth would,be
subjected to dearth, droughts, and famine*; the*
air infected with ndkious fumes; and in a word,
mankind would be utterly destroyed, which might
oblige our Maker (if I may be allowed the expres-
sion) to the necessity of a new Fiat, or else have^
no more creatures to honour and worship him; ^
As the devil never wanted iniinuatai s, I shalt
observe, that I learned a way how to make man
dream of what I pleased. For instance les us sup-
pose one to be sound asleep; let-another lay his*
'•'  • * * . moiith
mouth close to his ear, and whisper any thing so
softly as not to awake him, the sleeping man shall
dream of what has been so whispered in his ear;
nay, J can assure you, those insinuating devils can
do this even when we are awake, which I call im-
pulses of the mind; for from whence, but from
these insinuators, come our causeless passions, in-
voluntary wickedness, or sinful desires ? Who else
form ideas in the mind of man when he is asleep,
or presents terrible or beautiful figures to his fan-
cy? Mr, Milton represents the devil tempting Eve
in the shape of a toad, lying just at her ear, when
in her bower she lay fast aQeep; and brings in,
Eve telling Adam what an uneasy night's rest she
had, and relating her dream to him.. And likewise
I believe that good spirits have the fame inter-
course with us, in warning us against those things
that are evil j and prompting us to that which is
good* -
Were we to have the eyes of our fouls opened,
through the-eyes of our bodies, weihould fee this
very immediate region of air. which We breath in,
.thronged with spirits now invisible, and which
otherwise would be the most terrible: we should
view the secret transactions of those messengers
who are employed when the parting foul takes its
leave of the reluctant body, ami perhaps fee things
nature would shrink back from with the utmost
terror and amazement. In a word, the curtain
of• providence for the disposition of things here^
and the curtain* of judgment for the determination
of the state of fouls hereafter would be alike drawn
back; and what heart could support here its future
state of "life, much less that of its future state after
life, even good £>r bad.  • .
A gentleman of my acquaintance, being about
seven,miles distant from London, a friend that
came to dine with him, solicited him to go to the
rcjty.
city. What, said the gentleman, is there any
occasion for me? No, Sir, said the other, nothing
at all, except the enjoyment of your good com-
pany; and so gave over importuning him. Just-
then a strong impulse of mind urged the gentle-
man, and pursued him like a voice, with Go to
London, Go to London. Hark ye. says he to his
friend, is all well at London? Am.I wanted there?
Or did you ask me to go with you on any particu-
lar account? Are all my family well? Yes, in-
deed Sir, laid he, I perceived them all very hearty?
and I did not ask you- to go to London upon any
particular account whatsoever, except it was for
the fake of your good company. Again he put
off Bis resolution: but still the impulse suggested
to him, Go to London, and at length he did so.
When he came there, he found a letter and mes-
senger had been there to seek him, and to tell him
of a particular business, which was first and last
sibove a thousand pounds to him, and which might
inevitably been lost, had He not gone to London
that night.'
The obeying of several hints, or secret impul-
ses argues great wisdom. I know a man that was
under misfortunes, being guilty of misdemeanors
against the government; when, absconding for
fear of his ruin, all his friends advising him not
to put himself in the hands of the law, one morn-
ing as he awaked, he felt a strong impulse darting
into his mind thus, Write a letter to them: and
this was repeated several times to his mmd, and
at last he answered to it, as if it had been a voice,
Whom Jloatl I write to P Immediately it replied,
Write to the judge; and this impulse pursued him
for several days, till at length he took pen, and
ink* and paper, and fat down to write to him;
when immediately words flowed from his pen, like
£;reams
streams from a fair fountain; that charmed 'evert
himself with hopes of success. In short, the letter
was so strenuous in argument, so pathetic in its
eloquence, and so persuasively .moving, that when
the judge had read.it, he sent him an answer he

matter light to him; and indeed never A eft e&hort«,
