5 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



FOURTEENTH EVENING. 



^ il//^. BILL. Yesterday I gave you the 

^ particulars of Robinson's manner of liv- 
ing. Three years passed away, and it was 

ci> still the same. In all that time, and with 
such persev^ering constancy in labour, how 
V far do ye think was he advanced in the 
making of his conoe ? Alas ! he had scarcely 
cut through half the trunk of the tree, and 
it now seemed a matter of doubt to him 
whether he could cut down the tree in less 

»-- Vol. II. B than 

I' 



•m the neav 

than three or four years more, though he 
were to w(n'k with the same constant regu- 
larity as before. 

In the mean time he never slackened the 
Avork. What else, indeed, coidd he have 
undertaken? And, then, lie was neitlier 
AV'illing nor able to remain idle. One day 
the thought struck liim, that as long as he 
liad lived in this island, he had seen but a 
very small part of it. Hq was angry with 
himself for his own weakness, when he re- 
flected that fear was the cause which had 
prevented him from traversing the whole 
of it. " Perhaps," said he, ** had I been 
less afraid, I might have discovered many 
things which would at present be very use- 
ful to me." 

This consideration determined him to 
set out the very next morning by day-break 
i:i order to take a view of the whole island. 

Edw. How large might this island be? 

Mr, BilL Perhaps much about the ex- 
tent of the county of Middlesex. The 
saniJ day he made every requisite prepara- 
tion 



ROnjLNSON CRUSOE. 3 

lion for his departure; and the next morn- 
ing, having loaded one of his lamas with 
provisions for four days, having armed and 
accoutered himself, and prayed for the di- 
vine protection, he set out on his journey 
Avitli confidence. His design was to keep 
as much as possible to the sea-side, and to 
avoid forests, that^he might be less liable: 
tb meet with wild beasts. 

His first day's journey was remarkable 
for no extraordinary accident. He tra- 
velled about twenty miles. The farther 
he wei]t the plainer he could perceive that 
the situation of his dwelling-place was in 
the barrenest part of the island. In many 
parts he found trees, such as he had never 
seen before, which appeared to bear fruits 
capable of furnishing him with a nourish- 
ment as wholesome as it was agreeable. It 
was not until some tiine after that he knew 
the usefulness of them, and learned their 
names. 

Amongst these trees was one called the 
B 2 paper 



4 TftE NEW 

paper mulberry tree, the bark of which is 
M'rought into a fine sort of paper by the 
people of Japan, and makes a handsome 
summer stuff for the inhabitants of Ota- 
heite. I will shew you a piece of it, which 
I received as a present from a gentleman 
who had been with Captain Cook. Ro- 
binson slept the first night in a tree, that 
he might be the more secure from wild 
beasts, and at the first dawn of day he set 
out again. 

He had not travelled far before he found 
himself at the southern extremity of the 
island. In some places the soil wifs sandy. 
He had a mind to walk out upon a neck of 
land which extended pretty far into the sea, 
but suddenly starting back, he grew as pale 
as death. He looked round him all iu 
a tremble, and then, hanging his head, 
stood stock still and incapable of motion, as 
if he had been struck by a thunderbolt. 

Rich, What was the matter with him? 

Mr.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6 

Mr, Bill, His eyes discovered what be 
never expected to find there, the tracks of 
man's feet imprinted in the sand. >'^^-- F 

Edw, What! does that frighten bm? 
I think he should rejoice at thesi^htl 

Mr. Bill. I will explain to yon the rea- 
son of his fright. Upon hisiirst behoUiing 
these tracks, he did not. represent to himself 
the men, whose- steps had left the impres- 
sions he saw, as civilized, humane, com- 
passionate beings, ever ready to assist their 
fellow- creatures according to their power; 
but he imagined them to be barbarous, 
cruel, ferocious, ready, if they met him, to 
fall upon him, cut his throat, and devour 
him: in a word, he did not suppose that 
civilized Europeans had been upon the spot, 
but savages and cannibals; that ts, as I be- 
fore explained it to- you, and which you 
could not hear without being shocked, meii 
whose horrible custom it was to feed upon 
human flesh. 

Rick. That idea is enough, indeed, to 
shock one.

6 THE NLW 

K 

Mr. Bill, It wouKl have been better for 
Robinson, had he been accustomed from 
his childhood not to give way to the im- 
pulse of terror, even in the greatest dan- 
gers, and had he, at this moment, preserved 
more coolness and presence of mind. We 
can all bring ourselves to it, if we will but 
pay an early and constant attention to the 
rendering of our bodies, as well as our 
minds, sound and vigorous. 

Rich. But I do not rightly understand 
how we can bring ourselves to this temper. 

Mr. BilL By f o r t i fy i n g our bodies ^v i t h 
sobriety, regularit}^ and exercise, confor- 
mably to the intent of nature, and by pre- 
serving our minds k\tQ from blemish, by a 
steady and enlighteneil piety. Thus forti- 
fied, we shall be able to bear every change 
of fortune, and look upon danger with an 
tyo, of indifference, Thus, my dear chil- 
dren, if you will always temperately con- 
fine yourselves to those sorts of food which 
are by so much the more wholesome, as 
they are more plain and natural than otliers, 

and

aiul prepared with less luxiirioiis nicety ; 
if you wili abstain more and more every 
day from delicacies, those poisons in dis- 
<5uise, as pernicious to the health as they 
are agreeable to the taste; if you will avoid 
idleness, which is equally destructive to the 
body as the soul ; if, as far as lies in your 
power, yon will accustom your minds to 
a habit of attention and reflection, and 
strengthen your bodies with a degree of ex- 
ercise that inures you to motion without ex - 
haustingyou; if sometimes, on purpose, and 
of your own free choice, you will abstain 
from a thing which would be very agrec- 
abl G to you, which you even desire, and 
which it is perfectly in your own power to 
procure yourselves ; if, upon other occa- 
sions, you contentedly bear with things tliat 
seem disau'reeable, though vou could avoid 
doing so; if, farther, you contract the habit 
of not having recourse to others-, hut, oii 
the contrary, of finding in yourselves a re- 
source for all your w^ints, thus, as far as lies 
in your power, doing without the assistance

of other hands, and using your own judg- 
ments in order to receive from your own 
faculties advice and assistance in every trou- 
ble and difficulty; if, lastly, you labour with 
care to acquire and preserve to yourselves 
the precious treasure of a conscience free 
from reproach, which assures you of the 
protection and favour of the Almighty: 
then, my dear children, you will gain, and 
you will feel yourselves possessed of, all the 
strength of body and mind that you are ca- 
pable of possessing. The most whimsical 
and most undeserved changes of fortunewiH 
not trouble nor discompose your souls. The 
most disagreeable events may cause you 
some surprise, but will not have power to 
shake your fortitude, nor to alter the sere- 
nity of your minds; persuaded that, under 
tlie government of a Providence as Mnse as 
powerful, nothing can possibly happen 
which will not turn to your greatest advan- 
tage. 

Robinson, as you see, had not yet reach- 
ed, by his progress in true piety, that de- 
gree of fortitude go necessary to his happi- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9 

iiess and repose. This may be imputed to 
the Hfe which he had led for some years, 
so tranquil and so unexposed to dangers. In 
a state of constant tranquillity, (mark well 
this truth, my dear children,) in a situation 
of perfect security, man never acquires all 
the energy nor all the courage of which his 
mind is susceptible. Does it so happen that 
he is suddenly placed in circumstances un- 
usual and terrifying? He is weak, timidy 
and overpowered with terror. Nay, too 
much ease sometimes serves no other pur-- 
pose than to render a man vicious. Wo 
ought, therefore, to receive as blessings < 
those trials which Heaven sends us from 
time ta*time, be they ever so severe, since 
they are the means of knowing, of exer 
cising, and strengthening our courage by' 
experience. 

You remember into what a consternation: 
the unexpected sight of some tracks of 
men's feet threw the poor affrighted Robin 
&on. He looks round to every quarter; at 
the noise of every leaf he feels fresh terror. 
B5 i^ 



10 THE NEW 

■ In the confusion of his spirits, he knows not 
what to resolve on : :it hist, mustering up all 
his strength, he takes to flight, with the ut- 
most precipitation, like a man who is pursu- 
ed ; and so great is his teiror, that he dares 

• not, even once, look back. But suddenlyhe 
stops: his fear is changed into horror. 
What an object strikes his eye ! Ahl my 
dear children, prepare yourselves for the 
most shocking spectacle in nature! the 
horrible consequences of man's depraved 
state when totally abandoned to himself, 
and deprived of all education. He sasv a 

V^emul hole, in the middle of which was a 
space whereon a fire seemed t© have b(^en 
kindled, though it was tlien out*"»AlM>dAnd 

this hole 1 shudder while I relate it-- — 

he perceived hands and feet, skulls, and 
other human bones, scattered about, which 
presented the horrible remains of an unna- 
tural feast, where a human body had been 
devoured. 

The Children. How shocking ! What, 
by men ? 
Mr, Bill. Can they be called men ? They 



ROBIXSOX CRUSOE. II 

have only the outside of men: without 
education, degraded, rendered brutal, and 
like the most ravenous animals, neither the 
loathing which such an action would na- 
turally produce, nor thq compassionate 
feelings of humanity, prevent them from 
foUowins: the abominable custom of mur- 
dering their fellow-creatures to feed on 
them. These were their prisoners of war, 
on whom, after they had cut their tliroats 
and roasted them, they made a horrible 
feast, in which their savage joy manifested 
itself by dances and songs, or rather the 
bowlings of gorged cannibals. H^^fk.ojrZa^t'i 

C^iarlotie^ Oh! the detestable creatures ! 

Mi** Bill"* Let us, my dear Charlotte, de- 
test their atrocious manners, and not their 
persons : they have received no education, 
no instruction. If you had been so unfor- 
tunate as to have received your birth 
amongst these savage people, you would, 
i'ke them, run about naked in the woods, 
without the least shame, stupid and fierce 
as a brute beast: you would paint your body 
B Q ^ and 



12 THE NE^r 

and yowr face with various colours, par- 
ticularly red : you would inake holes in your 
nose and ears, and be very proud to carry 
in them, for ornament, birds feathers, sea 
shells, and other tritles: you would, then, 
make one of the abominable feasts of your 
depraved relations, and there take your 
share with as much pleasure as you do now 
at our best dinners. Rejoice, therefore, all 
of you, and bless God that you belong to 
parents who were born and bred up in po- 
lished society, where they have learned, 
from their infancy, to be humane, civil, 
-polite, *^a3d friendly, and not to neglect 
any thing that may render you also mrld, 
agreeable, compassionate, and susceptible 
of every virtue. Pity the unhappy lot of 
those men who, being left to themselves, 
still lead a savage life, like that of wild 
beasts in the woods. 

Htnrij, iVnd are there any such still? 

Rich. Far off, very far off from hence, 

in an island called New Zealand. Papa 

read us sometliing about it last winter in 

Captain Cook's Voyages. The natives of 



ROBINSON ClitfSOE. 15 

that island eat human flesh vbut^ it is to 
be hoped, their intercourse with our people 
will, by degrees, bring them to leave off 
so barbarous a custom. 

Henry. That would be well done. 

Mr, Bill, Robinson turned his eyes away 
from the hideous spectacle ; it made him 
quite sick, and he would, in all likelihood, 
have fainted, if nature had not relieved her- 
self, by forcing him to throw up whatever 
Avas upon *his stomach. As soon as he was 
a little recovered, he fled away again with 
so much precipitation, that his lama could 
scarcely keep up with him ; for this faithful 
animal followed close at his heels wherever 
he went. Fear had so taken possession of 
Robinson's faculties, that he quite forgot 
his lama, and hearing its steps close by him, 
as he ran, had not the least doubt but there 
was a cannibal behind in close pursuit of 
him. Filled with this notion, he fled with 
redoubled speed, to escape from the imagi- 
nary savage at his heels, and, in order to be 
less incumbered and jightcr in his flight, 

he 



l^ THE NEW 

h-e threw away Ills spear, his bow, his arrows, 
and his liatchet. This miglit have been the 
moment to make use of th'em, but he never 
once thought o^' doing so; in flight alone 
he placed all his dependence. But in his 
flight, he forgets whither he is running; he 
regards not which way betakes : theopenest 
ground is tliat which he prefers, let it lead 
liim where it will. Thus^ after he h?x\ run 
for near an hour, it happened that he made 
a circuit, which brought him back to the 
very spot from whence be had set out. 

Here was new terror 1 new perplexity I 
He forgot the place ; he had no idea that it 
was the same which he had seen before ; 
he takes it for a second proof of the horrible 
cruelty, the sight of which he was endea- 
vouring to avoid. He turns away, there- 
fore, from the spot, and continues his flight 
as long as he has strength to carry him. 
At length, quite exhausted, he falls down 
without sense or motion. Here his lama, 
having overtaken him, lies down beside 
him, spent with fatigue. By mere chance 

it 



ROBINSOX CRUSOE. \5 

it was the very spot where Robinson had 
thrown away his arms ; and these were 
the first objects that struck his eyes the 
moment he opened them. Seeing his arms 
scattered about on the grass, he imagined 
himself in a dream, and that whatever had 
passed was no more. He could not con- 
ceive by what means ihey were conveyed 
tliere, nor how he came there himself; so 
nrach had his fright disturbed all the 
faculties of his mind. 

He rose now to leave the place, but his 
confusion being somewhat abated, he was 
not so imprudent as to forget his arms : he 
gathered them up, and firmly resolved to 
part no more with the only means of his 
defence. He was so weakened, that it was 
impossible for him now to make so much 
haste as before, though equally urged by 
fear. He had no appetite for the remain- 
der of the day, and he never stopped but 
once, which w^as only for a moment, at a 
spring to quench his thirst. 

He hoped to be able to get home that 

same 



1^ THE NEW 

same day, but found it impossible. At 
night-fall he was within a couple of miles of 
his own dwelling, at a place which he called 
his country seat. It was a pretty large en- 
clobure, which he had chosen as a kind of 
park for one part of his flock, because the 
grass was better there than in the neigh- 
bourhood of his cave. The year before, 
he had lain there several nights in the sum- 
mertime, being grievously tormented with 
muskitoes at his old dwelling-place. For 
this reason he called the spot his country 
seat. His strength being quite gone, he 
was not able to go any farther. Whatever 
danger there might be in passing the night 
in so unsafe a place, necessity obliged him 
to stop there. Quite worn out with fatigue, 
and his mind still agitated with fear, he 
lay down to take some repose; but scarcely 
was he half asleep, when a fresh subject 
of terror had nearly deprived him of his 
senses once more. 

Rich. Poor fellow ! to what alarms he 
is exposed ! 

Edzv. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 17 

''■.., i 

Edw, \y bat was the matter, then? 

Mr, Bill. He lieanl a vb|ce in the air, 
^vhich very distinctly uttered these words, 
"Robinson, poor Robinson! where have 
/ou been ? How came yovi here ?" 

Rich, Bless me! what could it be? 

Mr. Bill. Robinson started up, all in a 
tremble, not knowing what to think. He 
hears the same words repeated , he ven- 
tures to turn his eyes towards the quarter 

from which the voice came, and finds 

what think ye? 

The Children, Nay, we can't tell. 

Mr, Bill, He found what a coward, if 
he would take the pains to examine before 
he gave way to his fears, would almost al- 
ways find — that he had no reason to be 
alarmed ; he found that it was no voice in 
the air, but the voice of his own parrot, 
which was perched upon the branch of a 
tree close by. 

The Children, Ha! ha! ha! that is 
droll enough. 

Mr. Bill No doubt the bird was tired 

of 



18 THE NIIAV 

of being left alone in the cave, and as il 
had many a time before followed its master 
to the place where he now was, it came 
thither to seek him, and pronounced the 
same words which Robinson had repeated 
to it hundreds of times. 

His fright was now turned to joy at hav- 
ing found out the cause of the false alarm. 
Robinson stretches out his hand and calls 
^'Poll !" The bird flies to him, and wel- 
comes him with a hundred fond caressess, 
all the while crying, ** Robinson! poor 
Robinson ! where have you been ?" 

Still restless and apprehensive, Robinson 
scarce closed his eyes the whole night. He 
had for ever before him the horrid spot 
which first occasioned hisfright. He strove, 
but in vain; to banish it from his imagina- 
tion; all his endeavours were to no purpose. 
When once the imagination receives a vio- 
lent shock, to what extremities docs it cause 
a man's thoughts to wander? What a cloud 
of darkness does 'passion spread over his 
reason? Robinson thought of a thousand 

plans 



ROBIKSON C-RUSOE. 19 

plans for bis futore security, every one 
raiorcextravaganltlian theother. Amongst 
the rest — would you believe it ? — he had 
formed the resokition of destroying, as 
soon as it was day-light, all the works that 
he had made, and not to leave a trace re- 
maini-nfr of all that had cost him so much 
labour. The copse in which he now lay, 
and tlie hedge enclosing the whole park, 
were to be destroyed; his lamas turned 
loose; his dwelling place at the cave, and 
th ' willow row, to be all demolished; his 
garden and trees to be grubbed up ; in 
short, every thing was to be sacrificed to 
his safety. He would not have the smallest 
appearance remaining of any thing that 
miglit seem to be the work of man's hand^. 

Bic/i, For what reason ? 

M?\ Bill. That if the savages should 
chance to pay a visit to this side of the 
islanil, they might not perceive, nor even 
suspect, that there was a man there, 

•Let us now leave him to liis apprehen- 
sions, as we can be of no assistance to him; 

and 



20 THE NEW 

and while we go to rest, sheltered from the 
danger to which he thinks himself exposed, 
let us be sensible of our own happiness. 
Let us return thanks to the Supreme Being, 
that we were born in a country, where, 
living amongst men who are civilized, and 
willing to afford us friendship and assist- 
ance, we may x:ompose ourselves to rest, 
without having anything to fear from the 
barbarity of inhuman savages. 

The Children. Good night, papa; much 
obliged to you. How agreeable has this 
evening's entertainment been I 



FIFTEENTH EVENING 



My dear children, it is a good proverb 
which advises us to consult our pillozv 
before we take any important resolution. 

Robinson 



ROBINSON GRUSOE. 21 

Robinson found the advantage of con- 
forming to this advice. 

You remember the strange resolutions 
which his excessive fear made him form. 
He was very happy that he put off the per- 
formance of them until the next day. 
Scarce had the mild light of morning dis- 
persed the shades of night, when he saw 
things in quite a different view. What he 
before judged prudent and necessary, ap- 
pears to him a senseless and extravagant 
project. In a word, he rejects all the 
hasty schemes that fear had put in his head, 
and he forms other plans which his sober 
judgment approves. 

Let his example teach you, that, in affairs 
which may be put off, you should not pass 
from resolving immediately to performing; 
defer this latter till the next day, as often 
as you conveniently can. 

Robinson now saw and acknowledged 
that his fright, the day before, had been 
carried to an extravagant pitch. ** I have 
been here," said he, *^a long tinpie^ and. no 
savage has ever yet come near my habita- 



tion, M'liicli is proof enough tl^at they are 
not settled in this island. It is most likely 
that they are inhabitants of another island, 
from whence some of tliem come here now 
and then, to celebrate their victories by a 
horrible feast; and probably they neverland 
but at tlie southern point of the island, and 
return to their own country without havi^ig 
the curiosity to come any farther. It is, 
therefore, by the particular direction of 
Heaven that I have been thrown on this 
part of the coast, the least fertile in the 
whole island. This very disadvantage is 
now the cause of my security. 

**Why sliould I not hope that the same 
good Providence will continue to protect 
me against all dangers, since I have hither- 
to been so remarkably preserved from the 
greatest?" He then reproached himself 
bitterly for having the night before shewn 
so little confidence in his heavenly Father. 
Filled with sorrowand repentance, he threw 
himself prostrate on the ground, to implore 
pardon for thi« new fault. Having now 

reco- 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 9,5 

recovered liis strength, he walked towatds 
his cave to put in execution the new de- 
signs which he had just formed. 

Rich, What did lie propose to do? 

Air. Bill. He intended to take some pro- 
per measures for his greatersecurity,Mdiich 
was very reasonable: for although it be 
our duty to depend on Providence, being 
persuaded, that, while we conform our lives 
to the divine precepts, we shall not be for- 
saken in time of need, yet, on our sides, 
we should neglect nothing that may con- 
tribute to our happiness or security ; for 
we certainly were never endowed with 
reason, nor our minds, nor even our bodies, 
enriched with such various facukies and 
powers, for any other purpose, but that 
we should, as far as in us lies, make them 
all unite towards rendering us more se- 
curely happy. 

"The lirst thing that he did, was to plant, 
without side, at a small distance from the 
trees which enclosed the front space before 
his cave, a thick wood which might cover 

it 



24 THE NEW 

it at a distance, and hinder it from being 
seen. 

With this design, he planted, one after 
another, near two thousand shps of that sort 
of willow which he had before observed to 
take root and grow up in so short a time. 
He took good care not to plant them in 
rows: on the contrary, he avoided all re- 
gularity, on purpose to give the whole the 
appearance of a natural growth rather than 
of artificial arrangement. He resolved next 
to dig a subterraneous passage from the 
bottom of his cave to the other side of the 
hill, that, in a case of extremity, as, for 
instance, when the enemy should have 
scaled his barricade, he might have a back- 
way to escape by. This was also a trouble- 
some and tedious task ; and you must un- 
derstand, that, in order to have leisure for 
it, he was obliged to give up the making 
of the canoe for a while. 

In opening this subterraneous passage, 
he began exactly as miners do> who first 
dig a pit, and then a gallery. 

Geo. 



no Ell^ilsON CRUSOE. 25 

Geo. What' sort of a gallery ? 

Rich. Do you forget? I can tell you. 
The miners, in making a mine, first dig 
into the earth straight down, as those db 
who are digging a well; and this perpendi- 
cular opening tliey call a pit. When they 
are come to a certain depth, they begin to 
hollow it out horizontally; and this pas- 
sage they call a gallery. Thus they go on 
from pits to galleries, and from galleries to 
pits, until they come to the vein or bed of 
metal which thev are seekins*. 

Mr. Bill. Very well explained. Ob- 
serve, that, when they dig thus sideways, 
or horizontally, the earth which is over 
their heads would soon crumble down, if 
they did not take care, as they went on, to 
keep it up: this they db by mean s-of cross 
planks, which reach from one side of the 
passage to the other, and rest upon uprights. 
BiSbinson took the same precaution. 

Whatever earth he cleared out of it, he 
carried close to the edge, and took care to 
level it. Thus, by degrees, he raised ater- 

VoL. II. C race. 



^26 THE NEW 

race, about ten feet liig-li, and almost eight 
thick. At convenient distances he had 
left openings, or port-holes, that he might 
see the out-counti y. He iiad, besides, made 
steps to go up to the top of the terrace, in 
case he should, one day or other, be ob- 
liged to defend the little fort from the top 
of his rampart. 

He seemed now sufficiently secured 
against a sudden or short attack. But, then, 
if the enemy should be obstinate, and block 
him up for some time, what are to be his 
resources ? 

This blocking up was not a vain fancy; 
it was by no means impossible that such a 
thing might happen some day or other. He 
thought it, therefore, necessary to provide 
also against such an event, and to contrive 
means whereby he might avoid the necessity 
of surrendering for want of provisions, or 
else dying of hunger. To prevent aky 
such extremity, he resolved to keep con- 
stantly withip the enclosure, at least one of 
his lamas that gave milk, and to have, by 

way

"way of reserve for the support of this ani- 
mal, a small rick of hay, M'hich M^as not 
to be touched unless in case of necessity. 
He v/as moreover resolved to lay up a stock 
of cheese, fruits, and oysters, and recruit 
it from day to day, according as tlie one 
or the other became unfit to keep. 

He had thought of another design, but 
was obliged to give it up, foreseeing that it 
would be too tedious in the execution. He 
was desirous that the water of the neio-h- 

o 

bouring spring, which formed a small rivu- 
let, might be conveyed, if possible, to the 
very door of his cave, that, in case of a 
siege, he might not be deprived of so ne- 
cessary a couveniency.- To effect this, he 
would have been obliged to cut through a 
small hill, which, however, was large enough 
to require a very considerable time before 
the labour of a single man could complete 
such a cut. He thought it, therefore, bet- 
ter to give up the idea, and return to the 
making of his canoe. 

For some years there happened nothing 
C 2 worth 



!2S THE NEW 

worth relating. I hasten now to an event 
which had more influence on the lot of Ro- 
binson, than all that had happened to him 
in his island as yet. 

One fine clear morning, as he was work- 
ing at his canoe, he perceived a very thick 
smoke rising at a distance. The terror with 
which he was at first seized upon sight of 
this, gave way to curiosity. He hastened 
to the top of his little hillock to discover 
the true cause of the smoke. Scarcely was 
he arrived there, when he was struck with 
consternation, at the sight of five or six 
canoes drawn up on the beach, and a score 
or two of savages dancing round a great 
fire, with the most fantastic motions and 
horrid cries imaginable. 

Though Robinson ought to have expect- 
ed such a sight one time or other, yet here 
again he was near falling into a swoon with 
terror. However, this time he quickly re- 
covered his spirits, by placing his confi- 
dence in his Maker. He ran down the hill 
to put himself in a posture of defence, took 

his 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 29 

..his arms, implored the assistance of Hea- 
Ten, and firmly resolved to defend his life 
to the last extremity. Fortified in this re- 
solution hy his piety, hefonnd himself mas- 
ter of sufficient courage and presence of 
mind to go up again hy his ladder of ropes 
to the top of the hill, from whence he was 
desirous of viewing all the enemy's motions. 
Presently his indignation and horror were 
raised to the highest pitch, when he heheld 
them drag two unfortunate wretches fiom 
the canoes towards the place where the fire 
wats. He suspected, at first sight, that they 
were going to disj)atch them; and he very 
soon found that he was not mistaken. Some 
of these monsters kill one of the captives^ 
and two others fall upon him, no doubt, in 
order to cut him into pieces, and. prepare 
their abominable feast. During this shock- 
ing execution, the other prisoner sat a me- 
lancholy spectator of what was doing, -in the 
expectation of very soon receiving the same 
treatment in his turn. But while these 
barbarians, were busily taken up with the 
C 3 butcherv

butcliery of his companion, lie watches il 
moment when nobody had an eye upon 
liim, and, with the hope of escaping* death, 
he suddenly starts away, and flies with 
astonishing swiftness directly to\yards Ro- 
binson's dwelling place. 

Joy, hope, fear, and horror, alternately 
seized onllobinson's heart; they appeared 
successively in his countenance, which was 
pale and red by turns. He felt a joy min- 
gled with hope, when he observed the pri- 
soner to gain ground considerably on his 
pursuers; he was filled with fear and hor- 
ror when he saw both parties coming as 
straight as possible towards his habitation. 
They v/ere separated from it only by a 
small creek, wliich the savage, who fled, 
must cross, by swimming, to avoid falling 
into the enemy's hands. As soon as he came 
to the bank of it, he threw himself in with- 
out hesitation, and crossed it with the swift- 
ness that he had exerted in running. Twd 
of those who were nearest to him threw 
themselves in after him, and all the rest re- 
turned

turned to their abominable feast. Robinson 
perceived, with much satisfaction, that 
these two last were not, by a great deal, 
such expert swimmers as he whom they 
pursued. He was landed before tliey had 
half crossed the creek.' At this moment. 
Robinson was animated with a courage and 
zeal, such as he had never felt before: his 
eyes sparkled; his heart throbbed, and 
seemed to urge him to the assistance of the 
weaker party. He takes his spear, and, 
without hesitating, runs down from the top 
of the hillock. In the twinkling of an 
eye he passes through the grove, and com- 
ing out on the other side, finds himself just 
between the pursuers and the pursued. He 
cries to the latter, '' Stop! stop!*' but he, 
turning about, is terrified at the looks of 
Robinson drest up in skins; he takes him 
for some superior being, and hesitates whe- 
ther to fall at his feet or run away from 
him. Robinson stretchinq^ out his hand 
gives him to understand, by signs, that he 
was his friend, and then, turning about, 
marches towards the enemy. When within

vcacli of the foremost savage, be tbrowfc ^ 
bis spear at bim, and strikes liini to tbe 
ground. Tbe other savage, being about 
one hundred yards belli nd, stops, quite sur- 
prised, fixes an ^rrow to bis bow, and dis- 
eharges it at Robinson, who was coming up 
to bim. The arrow struck him on the left 
breast, where the heart lies; but bickily it 
came with no great force, and the skins kept 
it off as well as a coat of armour could have 
done. The arrow fell at Robinson's feet, 
and he felt not the smallest hurt from ft. 

Our hero does not give his enemy time 
to shoot a second arrow ; be- rushes uj)on 
him, and, before the savage can draw the 
bow-string, Robinson lays bim lifeless in 
tbe dust. 

He now turns towards him whom he had 
protected, and sees him still on the same 
spot motionless, betwixt hope and fear, 
doubting whether the action that he had 
just been witness to, m as meant for his pre- 
servation, or whether he himself must fall 
in his turn, beueath the mighty blows of 

this 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 33 

this unknown being. The conqueror calls 
him; makes him understand by signs^ that 
he is to come nearer. He at first obeys, 
then stops, Afalks on a little way, stops 
again, advances slowly Muth evident marks 
of fear, and in the attitude of a suppliant. 
Robinson makes him every sign of friend- 
ship possible, and invites him to come close 
up to him. The savage approaches ; but at 
every ten steps prostrates himself on the 
ground, at the same time to thank him antl 
to testify his submission to him. 

Robinson takes off his mask, and looks at 
him with a mild^ humane, and friendly air. 
At this sight the savage hesitates no more, 
but flies towards his deliverer, prostrates 
kimself, kisses the ground, takes one of Ro- 
bins:on's feet and puts it on his rieck, to sig- 
nily th*t he \tas' \m s^kve. Buif our hero,

be well used. However, there still remain- 
ed something to be done. 

The first savage was wounded, but not 
killed. Being now come to himself, he was 
gathering herbs and applying them to his 
wound to stop the blood. Robinson made 
the savage who stood near him observe 
this, who immediately spoke some words in 
return. Though Robinson did not under- 
stand them, yet they pleased his car by 
their novelty, being the first sound of the 
human voice that he h.ad heard for many 
years. The Indian fixing his eyes alter- 
nately upon Robinson and his hatchet, 
pointing to it with Iiis finger, and then 
drawing his hand back again shily, gave 
him to understand that he desirq.d this 
weapon to dispatch the enemy. Our hero, 
though loth to shed human blood, yet sen- 
sible of the necessity of killing the wound- 
ed savage, gives his hatchet, and turns 
his eyes from seeing the bloody use that is 
going to be made of it. The Indian runs 
up to his adversary, strikes oif his head at 

a blow, 



1 6 




ROBINSON CRUSOE. 35 

a blow, and returns with the cruel smile 
of gratified revenge. Then, making a thou- 
sand wry faces, and throwing himself into a 
thousand odd postures, he lays at Robin- 
son's feet, by way of a trophy, the hatchet 
together with the bleeding head of the sa- 
vage he had killed. 

Robinson made signs to him to gather 
up the bows and arrows of the slain, and 
to follow him. The Indian, in return, 
gave him to understand, by signs, that, be- 
fore they went away, it would be proper 
to bury the two dead savages in the sand, 
that, if their companions should afterwards 
come to seek them, they might not find 
any remains of them. 

Robinson having signified that he ap- 
proved his precaution, the Indian fell to 
work with the assistance only of his hands', 
but with so much activity and dispatch, 
that in less than a quarter of an hour the 
two bodies were buried. They then set 
out together towards Robinson's abode, 
and went up to the top of the hillock.

Charlotte. But, papa, was not Robinson 
guilty of murder? 

Henry. Oh ! those that he had killed 
were savages; there was no harm in kill- 
ing them. 

Charlotte, Yet still they were men. 

Mr, Bill. Certainly they were men, my 
dear Henry; savages or civilized is not tlie 
point. The question is, Had Robinson a 
right to take away their lives? 

Rich, I think he did very right. 

Mr, Bill. And why ? 

Rich. Because they were inhuman crea- 
tures, and would have murdered a poor 
wretch who perhaps had never done them 
any harm. 

Mr, Bill. How did Robinson know that? 
Might not the savage who was pursued have 
deserved death? The others were, perhaps, 
officers of jul&tice, acting under the autho- 
rity of their superiors. Besides, who hadi 
made Robinson judge between them.?

Geo, And thev would all have come in 
a body, and have murdered our poor Ro- 
binson. 

Henrif, And devoured his body. 
M7\ BilL Why that is a prett}? good 
reason. You are not far wrong : he had 
a right to'do it for his security. But am I 
excusable in taking away another man's 
life that I may preserve my own ? 
'The Children, Yes, certainly. 
Mr. BilL Why so ? 
Rich, Because it is the will of ou^r Ma- 
ker that we preserve our lives as long as 
it is in our power: whenever, therefore, any 
one goes about to deprive us. of hfe, it must 
certainly be just to prevent \\\Vfh by tia,king 
away his, if there be no othcii means. 

Mr, Bill, Without doubt, my dear chil- 
dren, such a forced defence of ourselves is 
allowable by all laws divine and human ; 
provided, however, that we have absolutely 
no other means of saving our lives, than hy 

depriving 



38 THE NEW 

depriving the unjust aggressor of his. But 
if, on the other hand, we destroy our ene- 
my, when we have it in our power to pre- 
serve ourselves without doing so, either by 
flight or by the protection of others, or, 
lastly, by putting it out of hispower to hurt 
us, we are then guilty of murder, and ame- 
nable to the law. 

Remember, my dear children, to thank 
God that you were born in a country where 
the government has taken such proper 
steps for the security of our persons, that 
there is scarcely one in one hundred thou- 
sand under the disagreeable necessity of 
using such a legal defence for the preser- 
vation of his life. 

This is enough for to-day. When we 
assemble to-morrow evening, I shall, per- 
haps, find something more to relate to you.

SIXTEENTH EVENING 



Mr. bill. What shall I read to you 
this ev^ening? 

The Children. The New Robinson Cru- 
soe! 

Mi\ Bill. Robinson's lot, my dear chil- 
dren, in which we are all so deeply con- 
cerned, is still very uncertain. He went 
up, as I told you yesterday evening, along 
with thesavagewhom he had just delivered, 
to. the top of the hill behind his dwellino- 
being both of them exceedingly uneasy as 
to what might still befall them. The pos- 
ture of their affairs was dangerous and cri- 
tical ; for, was it not very likely, that the 
savages, after their horrible feast, would set 
out to seek their two companions who were 
missing, as well as the victim that had es- 
caped from them ? In such a case^ it could 
not be doubted but they would discover 
ik'i. Robinson's 



40 THE NEW 

Robinson*shabitation, and, uniting all their 
forces, have broken into it, and massacred 
him, together with his new companion. 

All these thoughts came into his mind, 
while from the top of the hillock, and shel- 
tered by a tree, he took a view of the sa- 
vages, who, by their extravagant dances 
and horrid bowlings, expressed the joy that 
they felt after their barbarous feast. He 
deliberated how he should act ; whether to 
fly, or shut himself up in his fort. His 
thoughts rising to the Almighty Protector 
of innocence, he found in himself courage 
and resolution enough to choose the latter 
determination. In order not to be per- 
ceived, he slipped behind the bushes, crept 
to his ladder of ropes, made a siign to his 
companion to follow him and do as he did, 
and very soon they were both at the bottom. 

The Indian seeing the commodious ar- 
rangement of every thing in his deliverer's 
dwelling-place, was s^zed Mnth surprise. 
His eyes had never beheld' any thing so 
well laid out. Hje felt the same SKDrt of ad- 
miration 



17 




ROBINSON CRUSOE. 41 

miration which a husbandman would, who, 
from the wildest part of the country, 
should find himself all of a sudden in the 
mid;st of a palace. 

Robinson endeavoured by signs to make 
him understand what they had to fear from 
the savages, if united, and that, in case they 
should come to attack him, he was resolved 
to defend himself to the last extremity, and 
even to death. The Indian understood him, 
and immediately, with a resolute air, bran- 
dishes the hatchet, which he still held, seve- 
ral times over his head, looks with a threat- 
ening countenance towards the enemy, as 
if challenging them to combat, and thus en- 
deavours to assure his deliverer that he was 
ready to defend himself courageously, Ro- 
binson applauded these marks of intrepidity, 
armed the Indian with a spear, a bow and 
arrows, and placed him sentinel at a kind 
of port-hole which he had made in hie ter- 
race, that he might have a view of whatever 
passed in the empty space between that 
and the wood which he had planted. 

Abcfut 



42 THE NEW 

About an hour afterwards, they heard, 
all at once, strange and dreadful cries at a 
distance, which seemed to come from many 
savages together. They both prepared for 
combat, and, by their looks, mutually en- 
couraged each otl^er to make the most vi- 
gorous defence. The cries ceased — pre- 
sently they began again, louder and nearer 
— they are succeeded by a deep silence. — 
Quite near at hand — 

Charlotte, Oh ! papa, if they come I 
shall run away. 

Henry. What nonsense 1 

Geo, Do not be uneasy, Charlotte; 
Robinson will contrive to defend himself. 
I am not in pain for him. 

Charlotte, You will see ; they are going 
to murder him. 

Rich, Pshaw, hold your tongue. 

Mr, Bill. Quite near at hand shouted 
a terrible hoarse voice, which was repeated 
by the echo of the hillock. Already our 
two champions were in a posture of defence; 
already their bows were bent ; the tirst sa- 
vage

vage that shew'ed himself must infallibly 
have receiv^ed a mortal -svound. Their eye?, 
all attention and sparkling with courage, 
were fixed on that quarter of the wood 
from whence the voice had been heard. 
Here. I stop. 

The Childrm, But what is the reason of 
this long silencer why does not papa go 
on with the story ? 

Mi\ Bill. To furnish you with a fresh 
opportunity of exercising yourselves in the 
art of conquering your desires. You are 
all impatient to know the success of the 
bloody fight in which Robinson seems on 
the point of engaging. If you absolutely 
desire it, I am ready to satisfy your cu- 
riosity. But let me see, suppose you were, 
of your own accord, to suspend it for to- 
day; suppose you were freely to give up 
the gratification of your curiosity until to- 
morrow? However, you are at perfect li- 
berty to do as you please, and decide either 
way. Speak ; do you consent or not ? 

The Children, Yes, papa, we agree to it. 



44 THE NEW 

— We shall be in some pain about Robin- 
son — but never mind, to-morrow evening 
will make amends — Heaven preserve poor 
Robinson ! 

Mi\ Bill, Your compliance, my dear 
children, fills me with joy. Amuse your- 
selves, for the remainder of the evening, 
in whatever way is most agreeable to you. 
I am never apprehensive that your time 
\n\\ hang heavy on your hands; on the 
contrary, I rather suppose that you will 
think the call for supper too early. 



IWilllliHIII 



SEVENTEENTH EVENING, 



Mr. bill. We last night left Robinsoi 
and his companion on the watch, to observe 
whatever might be going forward on the 
outside of the barricade. They continued 
on guard till it was almost night; but 

having 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 45 

having perceived no enemy, nor heard 
any voice for some hours, it seemed very 
probable, thai the savages, disappointed in 
their search, had returned to their canoes, 
and were gone back to their own island. 
They laid down thetr arms, therefore, and 
Robinson brought out something for sup- 
per. 

As this day, so particularly remarkable 
iu the adventures of our hero, happened 
to be a Friday, he resolved, in some measure, 
to perpetuate the remembrance both of the 
day and the events which distinguished it, 
by giving to the savage whose life he had 
saved the name of Friday. 

Till now, Robinson had scarce time to 
look at him with attention. He was a 
well-made young man, about twenty years 
of age ; his complexion was swarthy, his 
hair black and long, not woolly like that 
of the negroes ; his nose was short, though 
not very flat, his lips small, and his teeth 
as white as ivory. In his ears he; wore va- 
rious feathers and shells, an ornament on 

which 



46 THE NEW 

which he seemed to lay no small value; ni 
other respects he was naked. 

Robinson, who had a proper regard for 
decency, would not go to supper, though 
hunger called him pressingly, until he had 
fitted a skill for his new guest, which serv- 
ed him l)y way of apron. He then made 
signs to him to sit down beside him and eat 
his supper. Friday, as we shall now call 
him, approaches Robinson with all the to- 
kens imaginable of respect and gratitude; 
he falls down on his face before him, and 
places the foot of his deliverer on his own 
neck, as he had done before. 

Robinson, whose heart could scarce con- 
tain his joy on having found at length a 
companion and a friend, which he had so 
long and earnestly wished for, would have 
been glad to express it by a thousand marks 
of kindness; but, not knowing the charac- 
ter of his new guest, bethought it prudent, 
for his own security, to keep him in a state 
of respectful subjection, to receive his ho- 
mage as due to him, and, in a word, to act 

as 



ROBIXSON CRUSOE. 47 

as his sovereign for some time. He made 
him, therefore, understand by signs that he 
Av^ould take him under his protection, but 
on condition of perfect obedience; that 
he should perform whatever he was ordered, 
and abstain from every thing which he, his 
lord and master, should, of his good will 
and pleasure, forbid him. While he in- 
structed him thus by signs, he pronounced 
the word Cacique, Fortunately he remem- 
bered to have once heard that the savages 
of South America call their chiefs and 
princes by that name. 

By this word Friday understood, much 
better than by the signs which accompanied 
it, what his master meant; and, to shew 
that he accepted the condition of obeying, 
he repeated the word Cacique several times 
with a loud voice, intimating that he ap- 
plied it to Robinson, and fell down prostrate 
at his feet once more. To signify what re- 
spect he bore to the royal authority, he put 
a spear into Robinson's hands, and fixed the 
point against his own breast, shewing and 
acknowledging thereby that his master had 



48 THE NEAV 

the power of life and death over him. Ro- 
binson, with the dignity of a monarch, held 
out his hand to him, assuring him of his 
protection, and ordered him again to sit 
down beside him and eat his supper. Friday, 
out of respect, sat down on the ground, 
while Robinson was placed on a seat of turf. 
Here, my dears, you may see an example 
of the first beginning of kingly power in the 
world. Men, who e-xcelled others in wis- 
dom, strength, and courage, were the first 
kings. Weak men implored the protection 
and help of the stronger, either to defend 
them from the danger of wild beasts, whicli 
were in early times more numerous than at 
present, or to secure themselves against the 
injustice of violent men. In return, they 
promised to submit entirely to them, and 
to pay them every year a certain partof their 
fruits and flocks, that the protectors, not 
having to provide for their own subsistence, 
might be ^v holly at leisure to defend their 
subjects. This yearly payment, which the 
subjects obligedthemselves to make good to 

their 



ROBINSON CJaUSOE. 49 

their king was called by the name of triz 
bute, impost, public taxes, and the like. Such 
is the origin both of the power and riches 
wliich all the difterent sorts of rulers in 
the world enjoy, and of the duty and sub- 
mission which their subjects pay them. 

Robinson was now, therefore, m effect a 
king. The island was his kingdom, his la- 
mas and his fruits were his treasure, and 
Friday his subject ; his only one, it is 
true, but a valuable one. His parrot was 
the only courtier that he had, and almost 
useless in that character. Nevertheless, 
his majesty of the island vouchsafed to de- 
scend ev€n to his vassal as far as his dig- 
nity would permit him. 

Henry, What i^ a vassal? 

Mr, Bill, The same as a slave. — After 
supper, it pleased his majesty rery graci- 
ously to give orders concerning everything 
that he chose to have observed in the cere- 
mony of going to bed. It was not prudent 
that Friday, who had been so lately advan- 
ced to the stations of his subject a^ndprifne^ 

Vol. II, D 7?ii/2 istcr 



^0 THE NE^y 

viimstei\ his commander in cliiefdind his whole 
army^ his master of th^ /wrse 'dud steward of' 
the household, his chamberlain and grooju of 
the stole; it was not prudent, I say, that this 
new servant should so soon repose in the 
same chamber with his majesty. He there- 
fore judged it proper that he should pass 
the night not in the cave, but in the cellar. 
|iow could he resolve to trust his life, and 
the secret of the subterraneous passage, to 
a stranger, whose fidelity, having not been 
yet sufficiently tried, was far from being 
established ? He therefore ordered Friday 
to make up a bed of hay for himself in the 
cellar, whilst his majesty took the wise pre- 
caution to carry, with his own hands, all 
the weapons into his bedchamber. 

Afterwards he was not ashamed to appear 
publickly, before all his people, in the most 
humble and rustic employment possible. 
This action, perhaps the only one of its 
kind, will' no doubt surprise you, and you 
would hardly believe it, if I did not assure 
you t lat it is found in clear and express 

terms

UOBlNSOiT CRUSOE* 51 

terms in the annals of Robinson's reign, 
■^vhich have been made public to the wliole 
world many years ago. Robinson Crusoe, 
king of a whole island, absolute master of 
the life and death of all his subjects, did not 
blush in the least to descend, in the pre- 
sence of Friday, to a servile office. He went 
"to the lamas that were kept in his enclo- 
sure, and with his own'kingly hands began 
to milk them. It vv'as meant for the in- 
struction of his prime minister, and to 
show him how to do the same, as he in- 
tended, for the future, to commit the care 
of this business to him. 

Friday, with all his attention, could not 
understand what his master was doing ; for 
neither he nor his stupid countrymen had 
ever suspected that the milk of animals 
might be proper food for man, and as 
wholesome as it was nourishing. He had 
never tasted any, and was agreeably sur- 
prised at the sweetness of it, wh^n Robin- 
son persuaded him to put some to his lips 
for a trial. 

D2 After 



52 THE NEW 

After the fatigues which the}^ had suf- 
fered during the day, they both found 
themselves in want of repose. Robinson, 
therefore, ordered his slave to go to the 
place of rest which he had pointed out to 
him, and lay down himself, blessing Hea- 
ven for having, in one day, preserved him 
from so many dangers, and given him one 
of his fellow creatures to be his companion, 
and, perhaps, his friend. 



EIGHTEENTH EVENING. 



Richard. I am curious to know what 
Robinson will undertake now with his 
man Friday. 

Edw, Now that he has assistance, he 
will be able to perform many things which 

he could not before. 

Mr. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 53 

Mr. Bill. My dear children, you wil^ 
see every day more clearly what great ad. 
vantages man derives from society, and 
what reason we have to thank Heaven for 
having so deeply engraven on our hearts 
the inclination that leads , us to seek the 
company and friendship of our fellow- 
CFeatures. 

The first thing that Robinson did the 
next morning was to go with Friday and 
examine the spot where the savages had 
held their abominable feast the day before^ 
In their walk, they came to the place where 
the two Indians were buried, wliom they 
liad slain the day before. Friday pointed 
it out to his master, and plainly hinted that 
lie was desirous of digging up the dead bo-^ 
dies, and satisfying his unnatural appetite- 
upon them. Robinson, with a look of de- 
testation and horror, shewed him how much 
he disliked such an inclination, and lifting 
up his spear in a threatening manner, sig- 
nified to him that he would run it through

■ submitted withdut hesitation to his orders; 
yet he eould not conceive why he was for- 
bidden to taste a sort of food, of which, 
from iiis earHest youth, lie had always been 
extremely fond. 

They soon arrived at the place of the 
feast. What a sight! the ground stained 
Avith blood! Bones scattered about! Ro- 
binson turns his eyes away from it, and 
ordered Friday immediately to make a 
hole, and bury tliese loathsome remains of 
barbarous voracit3\ 

While Friday was at work according- to 
his orders, Robinson was carefully stirring 
the ashes backwards and forwards, in the 
hopes of finding some fire still amongst 
them: but to no purpose; the whole was 
extinguished, much to Robinson's dissatis- 
faction, who next to the valuable gift which 
Heaven had lately made him in his compa- 
nion, had now scarce any thing left to wish 
for, except a fire. While he hung his head 
and looked sorrowfully upon these ashes, the

remains off] re totally extinguisheci, Frlda}, 
seeing him so melancholy, made several 
sio'ns which Rohinson did not at all com- 
prehend ; then he snatches up th.e hatcher, 
flies off like lightning, darts into the wood, 
and leaves Rohinson, who knew not hisde- 
^'gn, in the greatest astonishment possihle. 
Having followed him with his eyes as 
long as he could, '* What can this mean?" 
said he. *' Can the ungrateful fellow intend 
to forsake me? Can he be treaciicrous 
enough to take possession of my dwelling 
place, and keep me out of it by force ? Or 
would he have tlie barbarity to dehver me 
up by stratagem to his savage conn tr}''- 
men ?" — Horrid thought! — Transported 
with rage, be seizes his spear, and sets out 
in pursuit of the ungrateful traitor, at once 
to punish and prevent his base attempts. 
Already he was running full speed, when, 
suddenly, he perceived Friday returning 
as fast. Robinson stops in a surprise ; he 
sees, to his no small astonishment, the ima- 
ginary traitor holding up in the air a small 

bundle 



^t> TII£ NEW 

bundle of dried grass, which first appeared 
to smoke, |nd then to be on fire. Friday 
^liiows it down, and hastily gathers round 
it other grass and dried branches, and 
kindles a bright clear fire, which fills Ro- 
binson with joy and astonishment. He 
tlien understood the reason of Friday's 
siidden absence. Not able to contain his 
joy, h^ flies, with transport, to Friday, 
embraces liim with ardour and aiTection, 
and in his own mind asks him pardon a 
thousand times, for the injurious suspicions 
that he had entertained of him. 

Edw. But where could Friday have 
found the lire?. 

Mr. Bill. He had hastened into the 
wood on purpose to cut two dry branches. 
These he bad rubbed together with such 
dexterity and dispatch, that they took fire 
quickly. He then wrapped them up in dry 
grass, and running swiftly with this bundle 
lield up in the air, the fire soon kindled 
the grass, and broke out in a blaze. 

Mr. MerecL Here, again, Robinson 
appears to me to be very much to blame. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 57 

Rich. In what respect, pray? 
Mr. Alered. In this: that, without hav- 
ing any sufficient proof of Friday's trea- 
chery, he forms, in an instant, the blackest 
suspicion of him. How is it possible to 
be so excessively distrustful ? 

Rich. What he feared might very well 
be true ; so that he had a right to be upon 
his guard against Friday. 

Mr. Mered.. Understand me right, my 
dear little friend. I do not blame him ei- 
ther for thinking it possible that he was be- 
trayed by Friday, or for running after him 
to prevent the fatal designs that he might 
have formed. This precaution was allow- 
able, naynecessary, with respect to a person 
totally unknown to him. But what I am 
angry with him for, is, that he never 
doubted a moment the truth of his odious 
suspicions; that he suffered himself to be 
transported with rage; that he M'as so 
wholly mastered by his passion as never 
even once to think that Friday's intentions 
might be harmless. Now our distrust of 
D 5 other 



^8 THE NEW 

Other men should never go so far as that, 
unless we had already received certain 
proofs of their treachery. In a doul^tful 
case, let us see the evil of another man — 
till then let us judge well of him. 

Mr, Bill, A good maxim. Attend to 
it, my dear children, that you may put it 
in practice hereafter. 

Robinson, as I told you, was transported 
with joy to find his ill suspicions ground- 
less, and himself once more in possession of 
fire, of which he had been so long deprived, 
and which he had so long and so earnestly 
wished for. He delights to behold the 
waving motion of the flames. At last he 
snatches up a burning branch, and hastens 
with Friday to the cave'. 

He instantly lights up a large fire, and 
places potatoes round it to roast. He next 
runs to his flock, chuses out a young lama, 
kills it, and, having skinned and cut it up, 
puts a quarter of it on the spit, which he 
instructs Friday how to turn. 

While he is thus employed, Robinsdn 

CUt^i 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 59 

cuts off a piece of the breast of the lama. 
He then peels a few potatoes, bruises and 
grinds some maize between two flat stones 
to make flour of it, and puts the wliole into 
one of his pots, which after he had poured 
in a sufficient quantity of wat^r, not for- 
getting salt, he sets over the fire. 

Geo. I know what he was going to 
make — some broth. 

Mr, Bill, The very thing. He had not 
tasted any for eight years past. You may 
guess how much he longed for some. 

Friday looked on while all these prepa- 
rations were making, but did not under- 
stand to what purpose they were made. He 
Vas acqXiainted, indeed, with the custom 
of roasting meat ; but, as to all the rest of 
Robinson's cookery, he was entirely in the 
dark. He knew not even the effect which 
fire would produce on a vessel full of wa- 
ter. The pot began to boil just as Robin- 
son went into the cave upon some occasion 
or other. Friday, surprised at this odd ap- 
pearance, had no idea what could thus put 
D 6 the 



60 THE NEW 

the water in motion. But when he saw it 
bubhie up and boil over the sides, he ima- 
gined, in the simplicity of his heart, that 
there must be some living creature at tlie 
bottom of the pot, which occasioned this 
tumult in the water : and therefore, lest it 
should boil away entirely, he put his hand 
in to seize the creature, whatever it was ; 
but, instead of finding that, he felt some- 
thing which made him roar loud enough 
to shake the wbole hillock. 

Robinson was startled, on hearing him 
cry out. His first notion was that the sa- 
vages had surprised them, and that Friday 
was already taken. Fear, and the natural 
instinct of self-preservation, urged him to 
escape, and save his life by the secret pas- 
sage under ground; but he quickly re- 
jected this idea, considering how base it 
would be thus to abandon his subject, or 
rather friend. Without hesitating, there- 
fore, he sallied forth from the cave, firmly 
resolved to shed the last drop of his blood, 

if 



19 




ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6l 

necessary, in rescuing Friday, once more, 
from the hands of his barbarous enemies. 

Mr, Mered, Now I like you, my friend 
Robinson. 

Mi\ BilL He springs out, with his spear 
in his hand : but, to his utter astonishment, 
finds Friday all alone, crying, twisting 
himself about, and making a thousand wry 
faces. Robinson stood motionless, not 
knowing what to think ; at length he 
found, after a few signs, by way of expla- 
nation, that all this outcry was occasioned 
by poor Friday's scalding his hand. 

Robinson had no small.difficulty in quiet- 
ing him. But that you may know what 
Robinson did not learn until a year after, 
-when they were both able to understand 
each other; that you may know> I say, why 
Friday had made such a noise and so much 
ado, I must first inform you what notions 
ignorant people, in some countries, who 
have had no instruction in their childhood, 
commonly entertain when an accident hap- 
pens 



152 THE NEW 

pens to them of which they know not the 
reason. 

These poor people imagine that some in- 
visible being, or some spirit, is the cause of 
every thing for which they cannot assign 
a reason. According to them, this spirit 
never does any thing but by the orders of 
a person to whose service it is bound. 
They distinguish, by a particular name, 
those whom they suppose to possess such 
a power over one or more spirits : if it be 
a man, they call him a conjurer; if a wo- 
man, a witch. 

For instance, in some places, if an ig- 
norant countryman has either of his cattle 
fall suddenly ill, and cannot guess its dis- 
order, he, perhaps, will be weak enough 
to think that some old person in the neigh- 
bourhood has bewitched the beast; that 
is, made it fallsick by means of an evil spirit. 

Charlotte. Yes, papa; just so Nanny, 
our dairy-maid, said the other day, Avhen 
one of the cows went dry all of a sudden, 

Mr, Bill Jvlydear Charlotte, you should 

try 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6$ 

try to convince the poor girl of her error; 
it vvill certainly be better for her to be 
undeceived. 

If, on the one hand, ignorant people give 
credit to these silly notions, there are not 
wanting, on the other, impostors who turn 
such credulity to their own advantage, and 
cunningly trick those out of their money 
who are so weak as to believe in witchcraft, 
or conjuring: for, by pretending to the 
art, they confirm the others in the notion 
that there is really such a thing. Under 
the name^of conjurers and fortune-tellers, 
they promise, with an air of confident gra- 
vity, to break the charm, and force the evil 
spirit to loose its hold; but they always 
demand for their trouble a certain recom- 
pense, which is to be paid them before- 
hand. In return for this, they amuse their 
employers witl^ empty words, ridiculous 
grimaces, unmeaning gestures, and non- 
sensical mummery. If the beast's illness 
ceases of its own accord, the fortune-teller 
triumphs, and the credulous man, whom 

he 



64 



THE NE^V" 



he has deceived, is disposed, more tlian ever, 
to be the dupe of such imposture. On the 
contrary, if the bickness gets the better, 
and the beast dies, the conjurer will, by 
his evasions and uninteUigible cant, impose 
on the ignorant owner, who will afterwards 
be as ready as ever to consult a fortune- 
teller upon the same occasion. 

In proportion as men's understandings 
are narrowed by prejudice and darkened 
hy ignorance, the more they are inchned to 
this ridiculons superstition : you may ima- 
gine, therefore, that it is pretty generally 
received amongst savage nations. What- 
ever cross accidents happen to them, of 
which their weak reason cannot point out 
the cause, they attribute them to evil 
spirits; and this was*€xactly Friday's case^ 

He had never heard it said, nor discovered 
by his own experience, tha*^^ water could be 
made to boil; nor had he ever. felt the ef- 
fect of it in that state, by putting his hand, 
into it: so thathe could not conceive whence 
tbatacute and sudden pain proceeded, which 

he 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 65 

he felt on touching the boiling water, and, 
therefore, firmly believed that there was 
enchantment in it, and that Robinson was 
a conjurer. 

I am going to put you on your guard, 
my dear children, that you may not be de- 
ceived in these matters. You will often, in 
the course of your lives, have occasion to 
see effects of which vou will not be able to 
discover the causes. You will meet with 
jugglers, persons who deal in slight of 
hand, who will frequently surprise you with 
the ingenious tricks and devices that they 
shew, but oftener by the dexterity with 
which they perform them. For instance, 
they will change, to all appearance, a bird 
into a mouse ; they will cut a bird's head off, 
and afterwards shevv^ it to you alive and 
well; in short, they will perform several 
tricks of the same natiire, and you shall ne- 
ver be able, with the greatest attention, to 
find out the manner of performing them. 
If, on such occasions, you should be tempted 
to believe that there is witchcraft in the 

matter, 



€6 THE NEW 

matter, remember Friday, aiul be assured 
tbat you are in the same error with him, 
and take that for supernatural, wiiich when 
explained, appears perfectly natural and 
easy. But, to give you a proper idea of this 
subject, we will, at some convenient oppor- 
tunity, shew you one or two of these tricks, 
and, at the same time, explain to you how 
they are performed, that you may be a])le 
to form a judgment of all others of the 
same nature. 

Robinson, as I told you before, did not 
easily succeed in comforting Friday, and 
persuading him to take his place again at 
the spit. He consented to it, however, at 
last, but could not help looking still at the 
pot with a mixture of curiosity and horror. 
As to Robinson, whom he took for a super- 
natural being, he could not lift his e^es. to- 
wards him without shewing the most timo- 
rous respect. What confirmed him in his 
opinion was his master's ruddy complexion 
and long beard, which gave him an appear- 
ance 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 0/ 

ance so different from that of Friday and 
his tawny, beardless countrymen. 

Edw, Have the savages of South Ame- 
rica no beard? 

Mr. Bill. No; and it has been long* 
thouglit that they were beardless by nature. 
But some pretend lately to have observed 
that the reason of their seeming to have no 
beard, is their taking the greatest care imi- 
ginable to pluck it up as it grows. 

But the broth, the potatoes, and the roast 
meat, \vere now ready. As they had no 
spoons, Robinson poured out the broth in 
two pipkins, but nothing could induce Fri- 
day so much as to taste it; he had not the 
least doubt of itsbeingan enchanted liquor. 
It made him shudder to see Robinson sup 
it with so much appearance of satisfaction; 
but he helped himself to the roast meat and 
potatoes, which made him amends. 

You may easily imagine how delicious 
these nourishing victuals, drest properly on 
the fire, must seem to Robinson. They 
made him forget all his past troubles and 

hardships 



6s 



THE NEW 



hardships. He imaoined himself not in a 
desert island, but transported lo some po- 
pulous country. Thus Providence, in an 
instant, by a flow of unexpected happiness, 
cures those wounds which have been made 
in our hearts, and which, though intended 
for our good, the sense of pre^^ent pain 
makes us ever regard as the most incurable 
evils. I hardly need tell you, that Robin- 
son, in that happy moment, remembered 
the Giver of all good things, and thanked 
him from the bottom of his heart. 

The meal being finished, Robinson re- 
tired to meditate seriously on the happy 
change of his situation. Every thing round 
him wore a more smiling face. He was no 
longer solitary; he had a companion, with 
whom, it is true, he was not able to con- 
verse as yet; but the very company of this 
man was some satisfaction to him, and pro- 
mised to afford him the most valuable 
assistance. Besides, being no longer de- 
prived of fire, he might enjoy as wholesome 
and agreeable victuals as he could wish. 

'' What 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 69 

*' What is there to hinder you now," said 
he, " from living contented and happy? 
Enjoy in peace the many henefits which 
you have received from Heaven. You 
have fruits in ahundance, and a numerous 
flock, which will always he more than suf- 
ficient to furnish your rahle with whatever 
you desire. Make amends to yourself now, 
by ease and* good cheer, for the fatigues 
you have suffered, and the scantiness of 
your provisions for these several years past. 
Let Friday, who is young and stout, work 
for you. His services you have a right to 
claim, as you have saved his life at the risk 
of your own." 

Here an idea occurred to him which to- 
tally changed the complexion of his 
thoughts. 

" But," said he to himself, *' what, if you 
were very soon to see an end of all this 
prosperity ? If Friday were to die r If your 
fire were to go out again?" This reflection 
made Jiis blood curdle with horror. 

** And if, moreover, by being accustom- 
ed to an easy, delicate, inactive life, you 



70 THE NEW 

>vere to render yourself incapable of sup-? 
porting a hard, solitary, and laborious way 
of living, such as you have already experi- 
en trd? If you should be forced to return 
to it?'* — He sighed heavily. 

'* To what, then, are you principally in- 
debted for getting rid of the many faults 
and weaknesses which once disgraced you? 
Is it not to the sober and laborious life which 
circumstances forced you to pursue? And 
now, by indulging yourself in sensuality 
and idleness, you would run the risk of los- 
ing that health and strength of body and 
mind which temperance and exercise have 

procvired you. Heaven forbid!'* With 

these words, he rose hastily, and walked 
about in a thoughtful mood before the 
mouth of his cave. Meantime, Friday put 
away the remains of the'dinner, and, by his 
master's order, went to milk the lamas. 

Robinson continued to reason with him- 
self. ^* If you were to renounce labour 
and temperance, you would soon forget 
both the adversity which you surmounted 

and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 71 

and thefriendly hand which assisted you. 
Very soon you would become ungrateful, 
presumptuous, and, perhaps, impious." 
Horrid idea! and falling on his face to the 
ground, he prayed to be preserved from so 
dreadful a state of depravation. This led 
him to take a resolution as prudent as it 
was unalterable. 

'* I will,'* said he, ''partake of the gifts 
of Heaven, but always with the greatest 
temperance. The most simple victuals shall 
be my favourite food, let my provisions be 
ever so abundant and. various. I will per- 
severe in my labours with the same assi- 
duity, though they will.no longer be so ne- 
cessary to me as formerly. One day in each 
Aveek I will live on the same cold victuals 
with whrch I have hitherto subsisted my- 
self; and the- last day of each month I will 
confine myselfto the same solitude as I have 
experienced ever since I have been on tjjis 
island. I will send Friday to my country- 
seat, and he shall pass that day there." 
' Having formed these resolutions of self- 
denial. 



72 THE NtW 

denial, be felt the pleasing and pure satis- 
faction which ever accompanies the efforts 
that we make to attain a higher degree of 
perfection. He foresaw the happy conoC- 
quences of tliese voluntar} sacrifices ; his 
countenance, therefore, becoming more se- 
rene, sjioke the pleasing sentiments of a 
heart o\ erflowlng with joy. But he was 
sufficiently acquainted, from experience, 
Avith the inconstancy of the human heart, 
not to be on his guard against the fickle- 
ness of his own. He thought it best to 
make som€ visible mark, v hich, frequently 
meeting his eyes, might make him recollect 
his laudable resolutions every day. For 
this purpose, he engraved, with his hatchet, 
in the rock over the entrance of his cave, 
these words — Labour and Temperance. 

My dear children, I give you Until to- 
morrow to reflect upon these instructive 
particulars in the life of our friend Robin- 
ton. Try if you cannot find some amongst 
them, which you would do well to imitate. 
You will communicateyour thoughts to me, 
and I will also acquaint you with mine.

NINETEENTH EVENING, 



IvOBINSON had never been in so happy 
a situation since his arrival on the island 
as he is now. The only thing that renaain- 
ed to trouble him, was his apprehension 
lest tlie savages should return to seek for 
their two countrymen, in Mhich case he 
might probably be exposed to the necessity 
of shedding blood. He shuddered at the 
thought of being reduced, once more, to 
the dreadful choice of either destroying 
his fellow creatures or perishing cruelly 
himself. 

Things being, therefore, in this situation, 
it was incumbent en him to labour for his 
security, and to put himself into a state of 
defence. He had long been desirous of for- 
tifying his habitation still more; but, while 
he was done, the execution of this design 
appeared impossible. Now, with the as- 

VoL. II. E sistancc 



74 THE NEW 

distance of a companion, he thouglit liim- 
self capable of undertaking it He mounts, 
therefore, to the top of his hillock, to form 
a plan of further fortification, which he 
very soon did, as his situation enabled him 
to have the whole ground under his eyes at 
one view. He resolved, therefore, on the 
outside of the barricade of trees which en- 
closed his habitation, to dig a broad deep 
trench, the inner bank of which should be 
defended with a strong row of paling*. 

He, moreover, conceived the design of 
dividing the neighbouring rivuletinto two 
branches, one of which should run in this 
trench, and the other through the middle 
of the enclosed space before his cave, that, 
in case of a siege, he might not be in want 
of water. 

It was not easy to make Friday compre- 
hend, by signs, the whole of this plan; but 
as soon as he had some idea of it, he ran to 
the sea-side, and came back loaded with 
great shells, and with flat and sharp stones 
fit to serve for digging. They both; there- 
fore, fell to work immediately. 



^HOBINSOM CRUSOE. 75 

1 dare say you can easily imagine that 
this was no slight undertaking. The trench, 
to be of any use, must be, at least, six feet 
deep and eight broad ; the length might be 
about fourscore or one hundred yards. 

To execute such an undertaking as this 
without any instrument of iron — no pick- 
axe — no shovel — think what a difficulty it 
must be. Besides, it required little less 
than four hundred pales ; to cut these and 
shape them with only one hatchet of stone, 
was a labwious task. Lastly, in order to 
turn the rivulet into this trench, there was 
a necessity of digging a canal, which,-iii 
one place, must cross a rising ground; and 
this, to crown the difficulty of the work, it 
was absolutely necessary to cut through. 

All these obstacles, did not discourage 
our friend Robinson, who had taken a re- 
solution that was not to be shaken. By lead- 
ing a life of temperance and continual la- 
bour, he was in the executionof<lifficult un- 
dertakings, master of a degree of courage 
M'hich is not possessed by men brought up 
E2 ia 



76 THE NEVy' 

in idleness, used to delicate living, and 
enervated by effeminacy. JVith God's help, 
and with perseverance, was his motto, in be- 
ginning a work of labour and time; and, 
you know, when once he was determined 
on a matter, he never rested until he com- 
pletely finished it. 

He was the same on this occasion. Fii- 
day and he worked every day with equal 
pleasure and earnestness, from sunrise to 
•sunset; so that, in spite of the awkward- 
ness of their instruments, they advanced the 
work every day surprisingly. Fortunately 
during two whole months the savages ne- 
ver appeared ; a contrary wind hindered 
them from coming over to Robinson's island. 
All this time he was able to work M'ithout 
being obliged to take any precautions 
aa'ainst the fear of an attack. 

Robinson, who was earnestly desirous of 

beinir able to converse with Friday, took 

the opportunity to teach him a iew words 

of English every day, while they were both 

'employed at work; and Friday, on his part^ 

1 ■ was 



HOIUNSON CRUSOE. 7T 

was so aWentive, that in a short time he 
made a considerable progress. Robinson 
took the most natural and easy way to 
communicate the language to him : Avhen- 
ever it could conveniently be done, he 
placed the object before his eyes, and then 
pronounced the name of it distinctly; but 
M'hen it was necessary to communicate the 
names of things which could not be made 
perceptible in this manner, Robinson ac- 
companied the name with gestures and 
signs so expressive that Friday could i\ot 
possibly misunderstand. And, by these 
means, in less than six months he was able 
to explain himself tolerably well in English. 
This was a fresh addition to Robinson's 
happiness. Hitherto Friday had been no • 
better than a dumb man to him; now they 
are able to communicate their thoughts to 
each other as friends. How frivolous did 
the pleasure seem which Robinson used to 
enjoy in the senseless chatterof his parrot, 
in comparison M'ith the real satisfaction, 
which he felt at present ! 

E 3 1h^> 



78 TIIfi^LW 

The more he knew^Friday the more lie 
liked liim. The young; man was frank and 
good-natured, and had the greatest aftec- 
tion possihle for his mxister: so that Rohin- 
son grew fonder of him every day, and 
made him take share of his cave, that they 
might pass the nights together. 

In less than two months they finished: 
the trench; and now they saw themselves 
capahle of defying the savages, or even of 
beating them oif should they venture to 
attack them; for before any one of them 
could cross the trench and; the paling, it 
was an easy matter for the two besieged 
to send an arrow or a spear through his 
body. They looked upon themselves, there- 
fore, as sufficiently guarded against all 
danger of this sort. 

RoDinson and Friday, being one day near 
*Mie sea-side upon a rising ground, from 
Av^hence tliey had an extensive prospect all. 
over the sea, perceived, at a distance, som§ 
islands, which appeared like small clouds. 
Friday fixed his eyes attentively on that 
quarter. All of a sudden he starts np, falls

a (lancing, and throws liinisclf into so 
many extravagant attitudes, that Robinsou- 
thought he wasseized \rith asudden frenzy^ 
'' Good! good 1" cried lie, still continuing 
to skip about. Robinson asked bim the 
cause of this extraordinary transport. 
'^ Yonder is my country !" answered he, al- 
most breathless M'ith joy; *' that is where 
my people live !" His countenance, his eyes> 
his gestures, all expressed the love which 
he bore, his country, and his desire to see 
it once more. Robinson was not at all 
pleased with this disposition of Friday's :'it 
was certainly a laudable one, as it shewed 
that he loved his country, his friends, and 
hisrelations; nevertheless, Robinson feared 
lest he should leave him some day or other, 
and return to his own island. In order to 
be certified on this head. Ire resolved to 
sound his intentions, and, therefore, be- 
gan the following conversation, which will 
shew you the excellent disposition of 
Friday. 

Robmso?h Would 3^0 u be glad, then,^.to

return to your countrymen, and Irvt 
amongst them? 

Frid. Oh, yes; I should be very glad to 
see them again. 

Rob. Perhaps you long to eat man's flesh 
>vith them again r 

FrkL No, certainly. I would teach them 
not to be savages, hut to live on milk and 
the flesh ofaniuials, and, above all, to ab- 
stain from eating men.

Frid. Ay, hut only their enemies. 

Rob. Could you make a canoe that would 
carry you to them ? 

Frid. Yes, certainly. 

Rob. Well, then, make one, and set out

What is the matter with you? Why do you 
look so sorrowful ? 

Frid.

ROBIKSON CFvUSOE. ST- 

FriJ. Because my dear master is angry 
\vith me. 

Rob. Angry ! what makes you think so? 

FriJ. Because he wants to send me away. 

Rob. Well, hut did you not wish just 
z\o\v to he in your own country ? 

Frid. Yes; hut if my master does not' 
go there, I will not go — no — no more. 

Rob. Your people would take me for an -

you lay down your head, and stretch out 
your neck ? VV'hat would you have me do ? 

FricL Kill me: I would rather die than, 
be sent asvay from you. 

Saying these' words he shed a flood of 
tears. 

Robinson was melted: with tenderness, 
and embraced himv Be comforted; my dear

was equal to mine. These tears of joy and 
affection which you see me shed arc. 
pledges of my shicerity. Come to my 
arms once more. Let us dry up our tears, 
and never part. 

Tq dissipate the sorrowful ideas tl^.at ht 
had excited in Friday's mind, he spoke to 
him aa'ain of a canoe, and asked him several 
questions upon that suhject. Being satisfied 
with his answers, he took him by tlie hand 
and led hini to sec the canoe that he had 
began some years ago. Friday on exaniin- 
inff it, lauo-hed heartily to find 'the work so 
little advanced for the time. The tre\2 was 
scarce cut into the third of its thickness. 
Robinson asked him what fault he found in 
the work. Friday ansvvTred him, that he 
could see a vast deal of time had been lost, 
and labour thrown away, which n^Jghthave 
been spared; for that a tree like this could 
be hollowed in a few days with fue, and 
that much better tlian by any other means 
whatsoever. At these words Robinson was 
transportisd with joy : he fancied the canoe

already finished; he fancied liimselfah^eady 
sailing in it on the open sea ; ah'eady, after 
a happy voyage, lie fancied himself landed 
on the continer.t, and conversing with Eu- 
ropeans. Ljovv de.iglitful were all these 
ideas ! He resi>[^ exi that the work should be 
begun th^i vt^ry next morning by break of 
day. 

Geo. Ah ! then, our amusement will 
30on be at an end. 

Mr, Bill, How so? 

Geo. When he has a boat he will soon 
set sail, and then, when he comes home, 
papa will have nothing more to tell us 
about Robinson. 

Mr, Bill. An-d would you not give up 
that amusement for Robinson's sake? 
Would you not freely procure him, at that 
small price, relief from the hardships he 
labours under in his desert isle? 

Geo. Why, yes — very true- — I did not 
think of that. 

Mr, Bill, Besides who knows what may 
happen r Whether he may not be obliged 
to put off the working at the canoe, or his

tain; it brings with it so many changes, 
that, for the most part, it deceives our ex- 
pectations. We often ^ .8^ e our best ibund-

-nVENTIETH EVENING. 



Mr. bill. My dear children, I men- 
tioned to you last night, tiiat, in the affairs 
of life, the best founded liopes frequently 
vanish and end in disaj)pointnient. Tlie 
adventures of Robinson Crusoe have fur- 
nished you with frequent instances of this 
truth, and you have learned, I hope, from 
them, and the instructions tliat I have 
given you, to bearcahiily whatever events 
may happen contrary to your expectations^ 
But I have someiliing farther to propose 
to you, while we c«'e upon the subject of 
self-denial, as proper to accompany the 
practice of that virtue. It is an exercise 
of the greatest utility, and, with your 
consent, I will mention it. 

The- Children. Oh, yes, papa! yes, papa! 

.j^)\ Bill, If, then, you desire in the fii-* 

lure part of your lives to labour in strengths 

ening 



85 THE NEvr 

ening your bodies, and exalting tlie powers 
of your minds, to the end that you may 
become distinguished characters, and ca- 
pable of contributing effectually to the 
happiness of your fellow-creatures, and 
thereby to enhance your own, I offer to 
you, for that purpose, the following plan. 
I will, on my side; read to you, for your 
instruction, the writings of the ancient phi- 
losophers who v/ere preceptors to the illus- 
trious persons whom you so much admired 
when I went over the ancient history v/itii 
you. These writings contain the precepts 
which such philosophers gave to their scho- 
lars, and by the observance of which their 
scholars became great men. Every week 
I will write down one of these precepts upon 
a table covered with white paper; 1 will 
explain it to you, and shew you how, in 
the course of the week, you may acquire, 
in an easy and agreeable manner, the prac- 
tice of it. Yet you must not expect that 
this can be done without sometimes cost- 
ing you a sacrifice : you must, at one time, 

resolve 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 8/ 

csolve to deprive yourseif of a favourite 
anuisement; at another, to bear with things 
very disagreeable. This is the true way 
to acquire that niascuhne courage which 
is to assist us in conquering our irregular 
inclinations, and in preserving a prudent 
equanimity upon all occasions' of loss, dis* 
appointment, and danger. As to us who 
are advanced in life, we shall not be con- 
tented with merely pointing out the path 
to you, we will walk in it ourselves, and 
be your guides: in short, we shall advise 
you to nothing of which we shall not at 
the same time shew you the example. 
What say you, my dear children, to this 
proposal ? 

The Children, We agree to it ; we agree 
to it. 

Air. Bill, Very well, then we shall be- 
gin the first convenient day. It is now 
time to return to Robinson, What I 
hinted to you yesterday merely as possible, 
did, however, happen in reality. 

The Ckiklren, What was that,. papa? 

Mr, 



8^ THE SEW 

M)\ Bill. I said, that whatever reason 
Robinson miglU have to liope for a proba- 
ble and speedy departure from his island, 
tliere might, nevertheless, ha[)pen some 
unforeseen obstacle which would cause liim 
to remain on it longer. This obstacle ap- 
peared the very next day. 

On that day tlie rains began, and set in 
with great violence. Robinson, during his 
stay on tlie island, had remarked that they 
take place regularly tvv'ice a year, and al- 
ways about the time of the equinoxes. 
^ During this rainy season, which generally 
lasted a month or two, it was impossible 
to do any work in the open air, it rained 
so hard and so incessantly^ He had alsa 
experienced, that nothing was more pre- 
judicial to the health than to go much out 
of doors, or to get wet during this season. 
What Mas lie to do now? He found it ab- 
solutely necessary to put off the building 
of the boat, and to find some employment 
without goin^' out of his cave. 

What a happiness for Robinson, duviu 

th^s 



ROBINSON CRLSOE. 89 

tFiese wet days and the long. dark evenings 
of tilts season, to have fire and light, be- 
sides the company of a friend, wii'h whom, 
while they were both at work together, he 
might converse familiarly, and fill up the 
weary hours with agreeable employiiicnt I 
Formerly, he used to pass these dull even- 
ings all alone, in the dark, and without any 
thing to do; whereas now, sitting with Fri- 
day before a good fire, and cheered with 
the light of a lamp, he converses with a 
fellow-creature, and is not afraid of time 
hanging heavy upon his hands. 

He learned from Friday all the methods 
which the savages have for procuring them- 
selves any conveniency, and Robinson, in 
his turn, taught him a thousand things of 
which savages have not the least idea. Thus 
they both enlarged the extent of their know- 
ledge and industry. By mutual assistance, 
each exerting his particular talent, they 
succeeded in making several small pieces 
of work which would have been impossible 
lo either of them singly: and this con- 
vinced 



90 THE VEW 

vinced them how infinitely advantageous 
it is for men to be united by society, and 
held together, as it were, by the bonds of 
social affection and love of their fellow- 
creatures, in comparison to being dis- 
persed, and wandering oa the earth, each 
by himself, like brute beasts. 

Of the bark of trees Friday could make 
mats of a texture sufficiently fine and firm 
at the same time to make a -sort of stuff 
proper for clothing. Robinson, having 
learned the manner of this work, made, in 
conjunction with Friday, a stock sufficient 
for clothing them both. And it was no 
small satisfaction to him that he was now- 
able to quit those inconvenient garments 
made of hard raw hides, which he had 
hitherto been obliged to wear. 

Friday had also the art of making cord- 
age out of the stringy covering of t^^e co- 
coa-nut and the bark of plants resembling 
fldx; and this cordage was far superior to 
any that Robinson could make. He- had, 
also, a particular method of making nets 

with 



KO BIN SOX CRUSOE^ 91 

with thread; an occupation which seemed 
to render many an evening short that would 
otherwise have been insupportably tedious. 

During these sedentary employments, 
Robinson, took pains to clear up the dark- 
ness of his friend's understanding. He 
endeavoured, particularly, to give him just 
ideas of the Supreme Being. You will 
easily judge how great was Friday's igno-. 
ranee, and how gross his errors upon the 
article of religion, from the following dia- 
logue between Robinson and him. 

Robinson. Tell me, Friday, do you know 
who made the sea, the land, yourself, and 
all living creatures? 

Friday, Oh, yes, very well, Toupan 
made every thing. 

Rob. Who h Toupan? 

Frid. He that makes the thunder. 

Rob. Well, then, who is he that makes, 
the thunder? / 

Frid. It is a very, very old man, thatlived 
before any thing else in the world, and he 
nakes the thunder. He is older than the 

sun,. 



9^ THE NXW 

sun, inoon, or stars; and all the creatures 
in the world say O to liim (that is, accord- 
ing to Friday's meaning, worship him). 

Rob. Where do your countrymen go 
when they die ? 

Frid, They go to Toiipan, 

Rob. And where is Toiipan ? 

Frid, He liv^es upon the high moun- 
tains. 

Rob. Has any man ever seen him upon 
these high mountains? 

Frid. None but the Owokakeys (that 
is, the priests) are allowed to go up to him. 
They say O to him, and they bring us 
word what he says to them. 

Rob. Do those enjoy any happiness 
who go to him after they die? 

Frid. Oh, certainly, if they have killed 
and eaten a great many of their enemies. 

Robinson shuddered at this discovery 
of an opinion as erroneous as it was bar^ 
barous, and from that moment belaboured 
seriously to give him juster notions both 
of the Supreme Being and of a future 

state. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. Q3 

>tate. He taui^lit hini that God is an in- 
visible beino^, almighty, infinitely wise and 
good; that he created all things; governs 
and upholds all things; that he himself is 
without beginning, is everywhere present, 
knows all our thoughts, hears our words, 
and sees all our actions; that he delights 
in good and abhors evil, and that he will 
make happy in this life, and in that which 
is to come, those who endeavour, with all 
their heart, and ^\ itli all their strength, 
to become better and better every day. 

Friday heard those sublime and comfort- 
ing doctrines with a respectful attention,' 
and lodged them deeply in his memory. 
As the zeal of the master to instruct was 
equal to the scholar's desire to learn, the 
latter was very soon clearly convinced of 
the principal truths of religion, at least as 
far as the former v/as capable of explaining 
them to him. From that moment Friday 
esteemed himself infinitely happy inhaving 
been transported from his own country to 
this island; nor did the refiection escape 

him, 



9^ ^ THE NEW 

him, that the intentions of Providence to- 
Avards him were favourable in suffcrino- 
him to fall into tlie hands of his enemies, 
since, had it not been for that event, he 
should 'never have known Robinson. 
** Thus,'* added he, ^' I should always 
have lived in ignorance of the being who 
is all-good and all-powerful." 

Ever afterwards Robinson accustomed 
himself to pray in Friday's presence; and 
it Vv^ould have been an affecting sight to 
see with what joy and devotion mixed ihe 
poor Indian repeated the words of his 
master's prayers. They were. now both 
of them as happy in their way of life, as 
two men can be who were totally separated 
from the rest of the human species. 

The dull rainy season })assed away with- 
out appearing heavj^ to them. The sky 
now cleared up, the winds abated, the 
stormy clouds were dispersed; Robinson 
and his companion once more breathed the 
mild and temperate air of spring, and felt 
their spirits enlivened afresh ; they now, 

therefore, 



-21 




ROBINSON- CRUSOE. g'5 

therefore, joyfully set about the important 
work vv'hicli they had designed before the 
rains came en. 

Friday, as being head carpenter in this 
business, hollowed the trunk of the tree 
by means of lire. This method was so 
effectual and expeditious, that Robinson 
could not lielp blamJng his own stupidity 
for never having thought of it. But he 
satisfied himself by saying, "Yet, if I had 
thought of it, I could not have made use 
of it, as I had no fire." 
. You will excuse me from describing to 
you the daily progress that they made in 
this work, as an account so particular would 
have nothing in it either entertaining or 
instructive. I shall only tell you, that 
the boat which Robinson alone would sxiarce 
have finished in several years, was entirely 
completed, with the assistance of Friday, 
in two months. Nothing was wanting 
now but a sail, which Friday undertook to 
provide, and oarS; which Robinson pro- 
mised to furnish. 

Rich. 



50 Til£ NEW 

Rich. Ay! how could he make a saii.- 
He slioiild have cloth for that. 

J\Ir. BilL lie certainly did not know 
how to make cloth; nor had he a loom; 
but, as I told you before, he couTd make 
mats of the bark of trees, and this matting 
the savages use for sails. 

They both fiaiishe^l their tasks nearly at 
the same time; Robinson the oars, and 
Friday the sail. But now, though the 
canoe was finished, it was still to be 
launched. 

Henry. What is tliat, papa? 
Mr. Bill. Were not you with your uncle 
once to see a, ship launched at Deptford .^ 
Henry. Oh! yes; I remember, 
Mr. BilL Then you must have observed, 
that the ship rests upon a hollow frame of 
wood-worl% which is called the stockl 
When they strike away the side stays that 
keep the vessel from moving, it slides 
along the frame (which is now called the 
stanchions) into the water^ and this is 
termed launching a ship. 

Unfor- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 97 

Unfortunately, the place where they h^d 
made the boat was more tlian half a mile 
from the seaside. How were they to get 
it thither? iNIust they carry it, or drag it, 
or roll it along? Each of these ways seemed 
equally impracticable ; the canoe was too 
heavy to be so managed. What are they 
to do? Here they were at a full stop: 
how were they to get over it? 

Edw, Why, Robinson need only have 
made a couple of levers, like that with 
which he rolled two great pieces of rock 
out of his cave when he was all alone. 

Mr, Bill, He had not forgot the use 
that might be made of so sinfple an instru- 
ment ; in fact, he had recourse to it upon 
this occasion ; but the method was so tedi- 
ous, that Robinson expected to be a month 
before he should convey the canoe to the 
sea-side. Fortunately, he thought of ano- 
ther method, to the full as simple, which 
is used by carpenters and other tradesmen 
ill Europe, for carrying the heaviest bur- 
thens. They use rollers for the purpose. 

Voj.. H. F Henry 



;;S 



THE NEW 



Henry' What are rollers? 

Mr. Bill, They are. pieces of wood made 
long and round, something like a rolling- 
stone. They are placed under the loads 
which are to be conveyed from one place 
to another. A man pushes the load at one 
end, which yields without mucli resistance, 
and moves on towards the place whither 
it is to be conve3'ed, the rollers turning 
under it all the while, as if of themselves. 

Robinson no sooner made trial of this 
method, but he was highly pleased to see 
with what ease and dispatch the boat could 
be moved along, and in two days time i 
was launched in the sea. His joy was 
doubled when he saw that it sailed with 
the greatest steadiness. 

It only remained now to make prepara- 
tions for their departure; that is, to lay 
in a stock of provisions, as much as the boat 
could carry, and then to set sail, both being 
equally eager to begin the voyage. But 
where were they to go ? Friday's wishes 
were to return to his native island; Robin- 
son, 



ROBINSOxV CRUSOE. 9^ 

son, for his part, would have been glad to 
land on the continent of South America^ 
where he hoped to meet either ^vith Spani- 
ards or other Europeans. Friday's island 
was only about four miles off, and the con- 
tinent was more than a dozen or fourteen. 
If they landed first on his island, they wewt 
some miles farther off from the continent, 
and, by so doing, increased the danger of 
sailing thither afterwards. Friday knew 
nothing^of the sea thereabouts, but barely 
to sail towards his own island ; he was quite 
unacquainted with the passage to the con- 
tinent, and Robinson knew it no better, 
having never sailed upon these seas. 

At length Robinson's uncertainty gave 
place to a fixed desire of seeking to land on 
some civilized country. In spite of all Fri- 
day's objections, and whatever he could 
urge, it was determined that they should 
prepare to depart the next morning, and 
set sail, under God's protection, with the 
first favourable wind, for that quarter 
F ^ where 



TOO THE NEW 

where Friday expected the nearest part 
of the coiilinent \a.y. 

But this is enough for to-day. It is 
rime lor us to make our preparations for 
retiring to rest. 



TWENTY-FIRST EVENING. 



3^R. BILL. Rohinson and Friday have 
now put all their provisions on board the 
canoe, and the Avind is favourable to them; 
50 that, my dear children, you have now 
to bid them farewell, perhaps, for ever. 
Who knows if we shall ever see them again ; 
or, more properly speaking, whether we 
shall ever hear of them more? 

The Children. Oh ! how sorry we are 
that they are going away ! 

Mr. Bill Such is the lot of men. They 

cannot 



ROBINSON. CRUSOE. 101 

cannot flatter themselves thst they shall 
always live with those who are most clear 
to them. They must, perhaps, more than 
once, enckire the torments of inevitable 
separation. It is, therefore, wise to pre- 
pare one's self beforehand for these part* 
ings, which are as painful as they are, at 
times, indispensable. 

Robinson, on coming out of his cave for 
the last time, stopped upon the top of the 
hillock to indulge meditation foramoment, 
and suffered his companion to go on before 
him. He reviewed, in his own iiiind, the 
various situations in which he had been 
during his solitary stay on this island ; and 
when he recollected the singular cave with 
which Providence had supported hini in a 
most extraordinary man-ner, his heart w^as 
moved with gratitude. He shed tears of 
joy, and, lifting up his hands and ej^es to 
Heaven, he addressed the Almighty with 
the most fervent devotion. 

" Oil ! heavenly Father, how shall I suf- 
ficiently thank thee for all that thou hast 
F 3 hitherto

liitherto cicjne fur me ! Unable as I am to 
express in words the whole ardour of my 
thoughts, suffer nie to manifest them also 
hy the lowly posture of adoration. On my

ground, or rolling in the dust, let me, as 
it were, sink into nothing before thee. But 
every thing is open tolhy eyes; thoureadest 
my heart; thou seest it lilled with inex- 
pressible sentiments of the liveliest- grati- 
tude. This heart, M'hich thou hast vouch- 
safed to amend, and which breathes but for 
tkee; this heart, so often filled with sor- 
row, and so often comforted by thee ; this 
lieart, Oh Lord ! is all that I can offer thee 
in return for thy innumerable kindnesses : 
accept it, therefore, accept it whole, and 
iinish the work which thou hast begun in 
it. Oh ! heavenly Father, receive me in 
thy arms, to which I commit m\sclf with 
confidence, and dispose of me according 
to tliy fatherly mercy. IVIay I never for- 
sake the road of virtue in which thy good- 
ness ha^ placed me ! Suffer me not, Oh 

Lord ! 



ROBINSON CKUSOE. H^S 

Lord ? to abandon it. In this hope I yield 
myself up to thee ; govern me according 
to thy wise and good pleasure ; I will go 
wherever thou shalt conduct me. I go, 
Avith equal tranquillity and confidence in 
thee, to expose myself, perhaps, to fresli 
dangers. Vouchsafe still to accompany 
me, and grant me thy invisible, but effec- 
tual safeguard I Watcli over my immortal 
soul, and strengthen it in the trials to 
which it may be exposed ! Preserve my 
heart from weakness, impatience, and in- 
gratitude towards thee ! Oh, heavenly and 
eternal object of my soul's love, my Crea- 
tor, my preserver, my all, my God !" 

Here the power of utterance yielded in 
Robinson to the force of hisfeelings; with his 
face to the ground, lie had only strength to 
weep. Encouraged, however, at length, by 
secret consolations from above, he rose up 
and cast his eyes once more upon the coun- 
try which he was going to leave, and which 
seemed on that account to become more 
dear to him. Like a man who is quitting his 
F4 native 



104 THE NLW 

native land without hopes of ever seeing it 
agaiiijhisinoibt and sorrowful eyeswandered 
still with affection over every tree which 
had once afforded him shelter or an agree- 
able sliade, and over every one of those 
w^orks which OAved their being to the labour 
of his hands and the sweat of his brow. All 
these objects seemed like so many friends 
from whom he was going to be separated. 
What were his feelings, when he perceived 
his lamas feeding at the foot of the hillock 1 
If he had not quickly turned his eyes from 
these dear animals, his resolution to depart 
\rould liave been shaken. 

However, at length, his fortitude got the 
better of his tenderness; he recovered his 
courage. With his arms open and stretch- 
ed out towards the country, as if he would 
liave embraced it, together with all the ob- 
jects that it contained, " Farewell," cried 
he, with a loud voice, ''farewell, ye' wit- 
nesses of my past sufiferings; for the last 
time farewell !" But this last farewell was. 
lost in sobs. Lifting, once more, his eyes 
to Heaven, he went on without farther he- 



ROBINSON CUUSOE, lUJ 

sitation towards the sea side. As he went 
along, he perceived his faithful Poll, who 
accompanied him, flying beside him from 
.tree to tVee. He felt an irresistible desire 
of taking Poll with him: he, therefore, held 
out his hand, and calls the parrot by its 
name. Poll comes flying to him as svvift as 
an arrow, lights upon his hand, runs swiftly 
up his arm, and rests upon his shoulder. 
Robinson now overtook Friday, who was 
waiting for him with impatience; and they 
both went aboard without farther delay. 
[See the Frontispiece.] 

It was the 30th of November, at ei<>*ht 
o'clock in the morning, the ninth year of 
Robinson's stay upon this desert islaixl, that 
they set sail, with clear weather and a fresh 
and favourable breeze. They had hardly 
got a few miles out to sea before they met 
with a reef o-f rocks. 

Harriet, Oh ! dear, let us know first 
wjiat a reef of rocks is. 

M7\ Bill. Seamen give this name to a 

immberof rocksjoined together, andeither

106 THE NEW 

entirely covered with water, or, in some 
])laces, rising" above it This reef or chain 
of rocks readied from a promontory of the 
island more than four leagues out into the 
sea. It seemed dangerous to sail over these* 
rocks: they, therefore, tacked; that is, 
placed tlieir sail in another position, that, 
by taking a sweep round, they might get 
on the outside of the reef. 

Ech(\ But if the water covered this reef, 
how could they know how far it reached 
into the sea? 

J/r. Bill. They could judge of that by 
tlie waves which they saw break over it; 
i'or in places where there are hidden rocks 
under the water, the waves rise higher, 
and appear whiter with fo im, because these 
rocks, ill stojjping then), make them rise 
and break them. 

Scarce had they gaiaed the outmost 
point of the reef, when, all at ouce, their 
canoe was carried away wit,h as much rapi- 
dity as if they liad many sails set and went 
before a strong gale of wind. They were 

both 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 107 

both terrified, and made haste to furl their 
sail, because they thought they had been 
surprised by a smart breeze. But this was 
in vain ; for the canoe was carried over the 
billows no less rapidly than before; and 
from thence they concluded that they were 
in the middle of a strong* current, which 
forced them along. 

Henry. What ? are there currents in the 
sea? 

Mi\ Bill. The bottom of the sea is no 
less rugged and uneven than the surface of 
the land ; and under the water there are 
mountains, hills, and vallies,-as well as upon 
land. Now, the water naturally runs with 
more swiftness towards the parts that are 
lower; whence it comes to pass, that there 
are currents in the sea as lar«e as the 
Thames, and often exceedingly rapid. It is 
very dangerous for small boats to fall into 
these currents, because tliey ^nd it difficult, 
not to say impossible, to get out of them 
again; so that they are frequently carriexl 
a hundred leagues out of their course.

Rich. Ah ! poor Robinson, what is to 
become of you now? 

Harriet. Why did be not stay in his 
island ? I thought sometliing would happen 
to him. 

M?\ Bill. In undertaking this voyage; 
be cannot be accused either of levity or 
ri^sluiess. He was moved to it by reasons 
of the greatest pru<l-ence, and most ma- 
turely weighed. Whatever liappens to 
him now, he may look upon as a decree of 
Providence, and to that he resigns liimself 
entirelv. 

They tried, in vain, to force themselves 
outof the Gurrentby rowing: an irresistible 
power carried tliem along with the swift- 
ness of an arrow : and they were now so 
far out at sea- as to- have lost sight af the 
coast of their island. Their destruction 
appeared ine\itable; for, in less than 3udf 
an hour more, they would lose sight ot tlie 
tops of the liighcst hills upon the island : 
after that, let the impetuosity of the cur- 
y^^nt cease sr-oner or later, it was all over

with thein; for tbey could not possibly re- 
cover tb.e island, having no compass to di- 
rect their course. 

Henri/. What sort of a compass ? 
Mr. Bill A mariner's compass. Ed- 
ward, who has made choice of a sea life, 
will tell you what it is. 

Edw. (laughing) I wish I knew every 
thing that a good sailor should know as 
well as 1 do that. A compass, Henry, is a 
magnetic needle in a round box. 

Houy. Dut what is a magnetic needle? 
Edz(\, It is a long thin piece of steel 
that has been touclied and rubbed with a 
sort of stone called a magnet, or loadstone; 
from which rubbing it acquires this sur- 
prising property, that, if balanced upon a 
copper ])ivot, one end of it will turn con- 
stantly towards the North. By means of 
this compass navigators can steer, their 
proper course, even when- they see nothing 
but the 3ky and the sea; otherwise they 
would soon lose themselves, nnd net know 
which way to saiL

Mr, Bill. DoyouuiulerstaiKl, Henry? 

Henry, Pretty well. But to return to 
the boat in clanger. 

Mr. Bill. Robinson, having no com- 
pass, could not possibly recover the island, 
if once he lost sight of it. What a dread- 
ful situation was he threatened with ! To be 
rolled and tossed about upon a vast ocean 
in a slight skiff, with provisions only for a 
few days ! Can any thrng be imagined more 
hopeless of safety ? It then appeared clearly 
tbat a true piety and a conscience void of 
reproach are an inestimable treasure in 
time of distress. Without this valuable re- 
source, howcouklRobinson havesupporteeJ 
the weight of despair which threatened to 
overwhelm him? He would have acted as 
a person destitute of hope, and, perhaps, 
deprived himself of life, to avoid the dread- 
ful alternative of [perishing with hunger. 

His companion, whose piety was neither 
so firmly established, nor so well tried by the 
number and duration of his distresses, as 
that of his master, was in the height of de 

spaijv 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 1 I 

spair. Unable to work, and absolutely be- 
reft of all courag-e, he rests his oar, looks 
at his master with a iiopeless disconsolate 
air, and asks him whether they shall plunge 
themselves into the sea, to prevent, at once, 
by a speedy death, the cruel terrors of 
that linirerins: one which seemed inevita- 
biy to await them. Robinson, at first, 
spoke to him affectionately, and endea- 
voured to reanimate his courage: he, then, 
mildly reproached him for not patting his 
trust in the wisdom of Providence^- which 
disposes of every thing for the best; and 
briefly reminded liim of all that he had al- 
ready taught him uj)c)n this subject. " Is 
it onlj' upon land," sakl he, *' that we are in 
the hands of the Almighty? Is he not also 
master of the ocean? If he thinks riuht, 
can he not order these waves, which are 
now so dangerous tons, to carry i;s to a 
place of safety ? Do you think that, by 
throwing yourself into the sea, you could 
escape from the lotto which he has destin- 
ed you? Learn, inconsiderate young man, 

that 



IliJ! ...THL NEW 

that your immortal soul will, during eter- 
nity, be under the boundless empire of the 
Almighty, and that it cannot hoj)e for hap- 
piness, if, rebellious to its sovereign, it 
counteracts his orders, by consenting vio* 
lently to break the bunds which unite it to 
the body." 

Friday was sensibly affected with the 
truth of these wholesome exhortations, and 
blushed for his own weakness. He imme- 
diately took up his oar again, and they both 
continued to row, although they had not 
the smallest hope that all their efforts could 
save them. Robinson said, *' We are but 
doing our duty ; for while we have a spark 
of life remaining, w^e are bound to do every 
thing in our power to save it. If we fail, 
we die with the Comfortable assurance that 
such is the will of the Supreme Being, and 
his will, my dear friend,*' added he, raising 
his voice to a tone of generous animation, 
** his Vvill is ever wise, even when we mi- 
serable worms cannot interpret it." 

The rapidity of the current continued 
5till the same: they could now sec no more..

of the island than the tops of the hills ; and 
now, even of them, they could discover but 
one, the very highest, and that was lessen- 
ing to their view very fast: in short, all hope 
of being saved was vanished. 

But when all human assistance fails, when 
thedistressoftheunfortunate is at its height, 
then, my dear children, then comes in aid 
the powerful hand of Him who governs all 
things; and the man who was on the point 
of perishing, is placed wholly out of danger, 
by means which he never would have fore- 
seen. This appeared in the present critical 
moment. Robinson had lost all hope of 
avoiding a'speed}^ death ; but, at the very 
moment when, exhausted with fatigue, he 
was obliged to cease rowing, he perceived 
tliat the swiftness of the boat's motion 
abated all at once: he observed aho, that 
the water did not appear so muddy as be- 
fore ; and, casting his eyes over the surface 
of the sea, he farther remarked that the 
current parted into two unequal branches, 
the largest of which ran violently towards 

the 



114 THE NLW 

the North, while the other, less rapid, 
turned short to the South; and in this lat- 
ter the canoe happened to take its course. 
Transported with joy, he addresses him- 
self to his companion, who was half dead 
with fear. ** Courage, Friday ! It is the 
will of Heaven that we shall still be pre- 
served!" And immediately he pointed out 
to him the circumstances upon which he 
founded his hope. They both, therefore, 
took up their oars again, which fatigue 
had made them let go. Re-animated with 
the sweet and unexpected hope of escap- 
ing from death, they exerted their last 
efforts to get out of the current, and saw, 
with infinite satisfaction, that, for once, 
their labour was not ineffectual. Robin- 
son, who, from a long series of disappoint- 
ments, was accuston^ed to let nothing slip 
his attention, observed, at this moment, 
that the wind would be of service to them 
he, therefore, quickly unfurled the sail, 
, which, catching the breeze, helped, toge- 
ther with their redoubled exertions in row- 

i 11 <>' 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 115 

ing, to carry tliem very soon out of the 
current into a smooth sea. 

Friday was ready to jump for joy; he 
rose up to embrace his master, who, how- 
ever, begged him to suspend his transports 
for a moment, as there remained a good 
deal still to be done before they could think 
themselves completely out of danger. In 
fact, they had been carried out to sea so 
far, that they could barely perceive their 
island, like a very small cloud in the far- 
thest extremity of the horizon. 

Henry. Horizon ! What is that ? 

Mr. Bill. When you are in an open 
country, does not the sky seem, like a great 
arch, to touch the ground before you, 
which way soever you turn? 

Henri). Yes, it does. 

Mr. hill. Well, then, the circle which 
thus bounds our view on all sides, where 
the eartli seems to end and the sky to be- 
gin, is called the horizon. You will soon 
learn more about this. 

Our two. intrepid sailors rowed with so 

much

much perseverance,an(l a prosperous breeztr 
pushed them on so favourably towards the 
eastern coast of the island, for which they 
were making, that they very soon began to 
see the mountains again. '' Come, my 
friend," said Robinson to Friday, who sat 
tOM^ard the head of the boat, with his back 
to the island, ^' come, Friday, we are near 
the end of our toil." He had scarce finish- 
ed these words before the canoe received 
so violent a shock, that the two rowers 
were thrown from their seats, and fell down 
at their length in the bottom of the boat, 
which now stuck fast, and was sqon cover- 
ed with waves that broke over it. 

Mrs. Bill, Well, my dear children, I 
would give up my supper, and, I suppose, 
you would do the same, to save our poor 
friend , but it is all over with him. Come, 
supper is ready in the next room. Nanny 
has been twice to tell me so.

TWENTY-SECOND EVENING. . 



Several of the children at once. Well • 
papa^ let us know quick what is become 
of poor Robinson. 

Mj\ BilL You remember, that, at the 
very moment when bethought himself free 
from every clanger, he fell into a fresh one, 
of a much more threatening nature than 
that from which he had just escaped. The 
canoe stuck fast all at once, and the waves 
broke over it. If it has struck upon a rock, 
there is no more to be said — our friends are 
lost. 

Robinson made haste to feel all round 
the canoe with his oar, and finding no more 
than about two feet depth of water, and a 
tolerably hard bottom, hejumped, without 
more ado, into the sea. Friday did the 
same, and they both recovered their spirits, 
on finding that the canoe had struck upon a 

bank 



lis THE NEW 

bank of sand, and not upon a rock. They 
united their strength to free the boat from 
the sand, by pushing it towards that side 
where the water was deepest. Tliey suc- 
ceeded, and when it was afloat they got into 
into it again. 

Harriet. But poor Robinson will catch 
cold — he has wetted his feet. 

Mr, Bill. My dear, when a man has 
strengt])ened his constitution by a simple 
and laborious life, as Robinson had, he does 
not so easily catch cold; so do not be un- 
easy on that account. 

, Rich. We ourselves do not so easily 
catch cold as formerly. How often had 
Me our feet wet last winter, without feel- 
ing the least inconvenience from it ? 

Mr. Bill. A proof that your manner of 
living has already strengthened yoa a little. 

After they had emptied the boat of the 
water that was in it, using for that purpose 
their oars and the hollow of their hands, as 
well as they could, they resolved to be more 
careful, and to use only their oars without a 

sail? 



ROBINSOX CRUSOE. - 119 

sail, that they might be better able to guide 
the boat at their pleasure. They rowed, 
Lheretore, to clear the sand bank, keeping 
close by the side of it, in hopes of soon 
coming to its end. This, however, they 
did not reach till after four hours rowings 
to such a leiigth the bank extended from 
north to south. Robinson remarked that 
it reached to the very spot where he was 
shipwrecked nine years before, and, in- 
deed, that this bank was really the same 
upon which the ship had struck. 

Henry. Struck, how ? 

Rich. Oh ! you are always interrupting. 

Mr. Bill. He does right in wishing to 
be informed, and you are wrong, my dear 
Richard, to take his questions amiss. Do 
so no more. A ship strikes, Henry, when 
it comes full against a sand bank, or a rock, 
from which it cannot disengage itself. 

Henry, Thank you, papa, for the expla- 
nation. 

Mr. Bill. At length, as they were come 
into a part of the sea that was open and na- 
vigable, 



120 THE NLVV 

vigable, they rowed with all their strength 
to arrive at the island, which they now 
saw pretty near them. They came up to 
it just as the sun was setting, and his 
beams only to be seen upon the tops of the 
hills; and they landed, quite spent witli 
fatigue, but intinitely pleased to be out of 
danger. 

They had neither of them taken any food 
the whole tlay; therefore, without waiting 
until they should arrive at the cave, for a re- 
freshment so absolutely necessary to them, 
they sat down upon the beach, and ate 
heartily of the provisions that they had put 
into the boat. When their meal was ended 
they drew up the boat into a creek. You 
know, I suppose, what that is ? 

Rich. Oh, yes: itis a small opening, as 
it were, in the shore, somewhat resembling 
the shape of a bay or gulf. 

Mr. Bill, Yes, but with this difference, 
that a bay is much larger, and a gulf still 
more so. — They drew up their canoe in a 
creek, and set out for their habitation, car- 
rying 



ilOBINSON CRUSOE. 121 

rylng back every thing that they had be- 
fore put aboard the boat. 

Edzv. Come, the story is not quite 
finished yet. 

M)\ Bill, Robinson and Friday are gone 
. to bed. Frida}^ is by this time fast asleep: 
Robinson, after returning God hearty 
tlianks for this fresh instance of preserva- 
tion, is preparing also to compose himself 
to rest. We might very well do the same, 
but as it is not late, .1 will tell you what 
happened the next day. 

Robinson, at breakf^ist time, spoke to his 
companion thus: *' Well, Friday, do you 
find yourself disposed to make a second 
attempt with me to-day, like that which 
we made yesterday ?" 

Frid. Heaven forbid ! 

Rob. Then you are determined to spend 
your days with me in this island? 

Frid. Ah ! if my father was here witti 
us ! • \ 

Rob, Then your father is still alive? 

Frid. Unkss he has died since I left him. 

Vol. ir. G Here 



122 THE ^SE^S' 

Here Friday, who was deeply affected, 
let fall tlie potatoe that he held in his hand, 
and, sitting motionless, he shed a flood of 
teais. Nor could Robinson contain his, 
Aviien lie thought of his parents. Lost in 
the tender recollection of former scenes, 
tliey both maintained a long and deep 
silence. 

Rob, Be comforted, Friday; your fa- 
ther is probably still alive. We will go 
and find him out the first convenient day, 
and bring him hither. 

This was joyful news for Friday; it put 
liim almost beside himself: his exclama- 
tions, his attitudes, were such as expressed 
the transports of his joy: he falls at Ro- 
binson's feet to thank him, but, in the ful- 
ness of his heart, he is not able to utter a 
word. 

Mrs. Bill, Ah, my dear children, what 
an admirable pattern is this of filial love in 
a savage, who has received no education, 
no instruction from his father; who is in- 
debted to him for nothing but barely life, 

and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1'13 

and even that a life which is really mise- 
rable ! 

Air. Bill. So true it is that God has en- 
graven in the hearts of all men principles 
of affection and gratitude to their parents. 
Alas! what a horrible monster must that 
man be, if it were possible for such to exist 
amongst us civilized beings, who should 
stifle in his heart these first workings of 
nature, who should feel no more than in- 
difference for his parents, and who should 
knowingly give them cause of sorrmv and 
vexation! If ever you meet with such a 
monster, my dear children, remain not 
with him under the same roof: avoid him, 
lie is the pest of society; he is capable of 
the most dreadful crimes, and will not fail 
to experience the terrible effects of hea- 
venly vengeance. 

When the transports of Friday's joy w^ere 
a little calmed, Robinson asked him if he 
knew the passage over to his father's island 
so well as to be certain, that, if they under- 
took it, they should not be exposed to dan- 
G 2 , gers 



r:24 THE NEW 

gers like those which they had experienced 
the day before. Friday assured him that 
he knew the passage perfectly, and would 
undertake it with confidence even by 
night; that he liad sailed it several times 
with his countrymen, when they came to 
this island to feast after their victories. 

Rob. Then you were amongst them 
when they killed men and ate them? . 

Frid. Certainly. 

Rob, And you took your share with 
them too.'^ 

Frid, Alas ! I knew not that there was 
any harm in it. 

Rob, On which side of the island did 
you generally land ? 

Frid, Always on the south side, as being 
nearest to our island, and also because co- 
coa-nuts are to be found there in plenty. 

Tills was an additional proof to Robin- 
son that he had good cause to thank God 
for having suffered him to be shipwrecked 
r.ither upon the northern coast than the 
southern, as, in this latter case, he would 

soon 



' ROBINSON CRUSOE. ] Q5 

soon have fallen a prey to the savages. He 
then repeated his promise to Friday that 
he would shortly cross over with him to his 
. island, and endeavour to find his father. 
He made him sensible, however, that this 
was not to be done immediately, as the 
present season was precisely the season for 
working in the garden, and thisjmportant 
business would by no means permit tlicm 
to be absent. 

They, therefore, setaboutthiswork with- 
out delay, Robinson and Friday strove to 
surpass each other in the art of digging'. 
During the intervals of rest, they emj)loycd 
themselves in finding out means to improve 
their gardening tools. Robinson, M'hose 
patience and invention were equally iiiex- 
liaustible, succeeded in making a rake, 
though he had no more than a sharp -point- 
ed stone to make the holes which. were to 
receive the teeth : from the nature of t'ne 
instrument that he used, one may guess how 
long he was in making them. Friday, for 
his part, contrived with a sharp stone to 
G 3 make 



]^G 'THE NI-:W 

make twospadesof soveryliard a\vood, that 
tliey were nearly of the same strength and 
effect as if they had been made of iron. 

Robinson was not content with providing 
merely for his wants ; he thought of making 
some improvements about his habitation, 
iun\, by degrees, of ornamenting it. Such, 
my dear cliildren, has ever been the natural 
consequence of the progress of the arts. 
Wliile men were obliged to think of nothing 
l)ut the means of providing for their sub- 
sistence andsecurity, they had not the least 
idea of cultivating those arts which serve 
meiely to adorn the objects that surround 
them, or to procure them pleasures more 
refined than those which they enjoy in 
common with other animals; but no sooner 
were they assured of their subsistence and 
safety, than they sought to unite the 
agreeable with the necessary, the beautiful 
with the nseftd. Hence arose, and were 
gradually brouglit to perfection, architec- 
ture, sculpture, painting, and all the other 
arts known by the general dcnominatiou 
of the fine arts. 



ROBINSOX CRUSOE. 127 

Robinson began by improving and orna- 
menting his garden. He divided it regu- 
larly into different quarters by pretty broad 
walks, which he marked out with a hue. 
He planted hedge-rows, and madesummer- 
houses and dark walks. One quarter was 
designed for a flower garden, another for a 
kitchen garden, and the third for an orchard. 
This last he enriched with all the best of 
the young lemon-trees that he found scat- 
tered over the island, besides a. variety of 
other young trees, which he grafted with 
scions from the bread tree. I had forgot 
to tell you, that in one of his walks he had 
discovered a second tree of this species. 
Friday, who was present at the operation 
of grafting, could not sufficiently express 
his surprise; he bad no idea of the intent 
of it,and would have (ioubted its success, 
had any other person but Robinson men- 
tioned it to him. 

They planted potatoes and^owed ii^aize, 
both in great quantities; and, as the soil 
had probably lain fallow since the creation 
of the world, whatever they sowed sprung 



128 THE NEW 

up as favourably as they could wish, and 
brought them a plentiful crop. 

At times ihey M'ent a fishing with the 
nets which Friday had made during the 
rainy season, and always caught more of the 
finny tribe than they could consume : they, 
therefore, released those which they thought 
superfluous,, throwing them back into their 
own element. ^' It is abusing God's gifts," 
E-obinson sensibly observed, " to grasp at 
more than is necessary to satisfy our wants; 
and it is an odious cruelty to take away the 
lives of harmless animals, when we are 
about to use them for our nourishment." 

After fishing they generally bathed. Ro- 
binson could not sufficiently admire Friday's 
cleverness in swimming and diving. He 
commonly ch.ose some steep rock against 
which the waves broke. He would cast 
liimself headlong from the top of this rock 
into tiie sea, remain some minutes under 
water, and by the time that Robinson was 
become uneasy about him, he would pop 
Ins head up all at once, and then throw 
himself into a thousand different positions^ 



23 




ROBINSOX CRUSOE. 1^9 

now stretched on his back, he let the waves 
roll him about; at another time — but, were 
I to tell you the particulars of his perform- 
* ance, it would ahiiost appear incredible to 
you. On these occasioifs Robinson reflect- 
ed with admiration upon the surprising di- 
versity of men's natural dispositions, capa- 
ble, in a manner, of arriving at any perfec- 
tion, if rightly exercised from their infancy. 
Sometimes they went a fowling or hunt- 
ing. Friday was no less skilled in using 
the bow and arrow than in making them. 
They killed birds and young lamas, but 
never more than were requisite for their 
table. Robinson, I observed before, con- 
sidered as a vfery blameable degree of 
cruelty the odious passion of kiUing any 
animal whatsoever for mere amusement, 
and without a view to conveniency. 

Whatever superiority Robinson might 
have over Friday with respect to undcr- 
standLigandindustry, theLntter, inhisturn, 
was possessed of much skill and dexterity, 
to which his master had hitherto been a 
G5 stranger, 



13(5 THE ]^]:.^V 

«traiig'er, but wliich, howtiver, were of in- 
finite service to them. He had the art of 
making, out of bones, shells, stones, &c. all 
sorts of tools, v/hich he used very dexte- 
rously in carvins: wood, thew^ork of whicli 
seemed almost as well executed as if it had 
been cut with iron. For instance, having 
found a long hone, he made a chisel of it; 
of a branch of coral he made a rasp; a 
knife he made out of a shell, and a file of 
a fish's skin» With these tools he provided 
for their apartment many httle pieces of 
furniture, which contributed to render 
their situation much more commodious. 

The art of reducing the fruit of the 
bread- tree into a kind of ^paste or dough, 
"Was of the greatest importance. This paste 
was as nourishing as our bread, and had 
nearly the same taste. The savages use 
this paste raw, but Robinson gave it a little 
toasting on the fire, which made it eat 
almost as agreeable as any bread. 

He learned, also, from Friday, the use of 
the chocolate-nuts, which having formerly 
found in one of his excursions, he had 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 131 

brought home a small stock of them for trial. 
When they were roasted before the fire, they 
afforded a food very agreeable to the taste, 
and as wholesome as it was nourishing. 

Robinson, who was fond of making ex- 
periments, pounded a few handfuls of these 
nuts between two flat stones, and, having 
reduced them to powder, he boiled them 
with milk. What an agreeable surprise ! 
The moment he tasted it he knew it to be 
chocolate. 

Henry, Ay ! 

Mr, Bill, Yes, like our chocolate in every 
respect, but that he had no sugar ^vith it. 
Thus every day Robinson found new re- 
sources to supply his wants and gratify his 
palate. But I must say, to his praise, that 
he persevered nevertheless in his resolution 
and habit of living temperately, and of con- 
fining himself to the plainest sorts of food. 

From this time they began to undertake 
longer and more frequent excursions all 
over the island, particularly when they ob- 
served that the wind was unfavourable for 
the savages to come over. In these excur- 



J:32 THE KtVV 

sions they made several discoveries whieh . 
they easily turned to tlieir advantage. 

When their work in tlie garden was finish- 
ed, they fixed upon a day to go in quest of 
Friday's father ; hut the nearer the time 
cipproached, tlie more Rohinson's anxiety 
increased. " Wliat if tliese savages^'* said 
he to himself, ''should treat you as an ene- 
my ? V/hat if they should pay no regard to 
any thing that Friday could say? In short, 
what if you should fall a prey to their mon- 
strous appetites ?" He could not help com- 
iiiunicating all these apprehensions to his 
friend, Friday protested to him, by every 
thing the most sacred, that these fears were 
ill-founded; that he knew his countrymea 
well enough to assure him that they were 
incapable of using those ill who were not 
their enemies. Robinson was convinced 
that Friday would by no means speak so po- 
sitively, if there was tlie smallest room for 
dgubt. He, therefore, banished all fear and 
suspicion, depended upon Friday's good 
faith, and resolved to set sail the very next 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 133 

With this intention they again floated 
their canoe, which had been drawn up on 
the beach, and moored it to a stake fixed in 
the ground. The same evening they roast- 
ed a quantity of potatoes, and prepared 
other provisions, intending to lay in a stock 
for at least eight j^lays. Friday shewed 
upon this occasion that he was not igno- 
rant in the art of cookery. As they had 
just killed a young lama, he proposed to his 
master a method of roasting it whole in 
less time than they could on the spit, and 
engaged that its flesh should eat more ten- 
der and juicy when drest after this manner. 
He went to work thus. 

He dug a hole in the ground about two 
feet deep; this he filled with several layers 
alternately of dry wood and flat stones. Here 
he made the Are, over which he held the 
lama, to singe it, or burn its hair entirely 
off: he then scraped it with a shell, and made 
it as clean as if it had been scalded iir boil- 
ing water. With the same shell he cut it 
open, and then took out the bowels. In the 
mean time the wood was burnt to charcoal^ 



134 * THE NEV; 

the hole was completely heated, and the 
stones red hot. He took out the wood and 
the stones as fast as possible, only leaving 
as many of the latter as were sufficient to 
CDver the bottom of the hole. On these 
stones he spread a layer of leaves of the 
cocoa-nut tree, and on, these leaves placed 
the lama, which he covered again with 
other leaves; and, lastly, over these he laid 
what remained of the hot stones. The 
whole was covered with earth. 

When they took up the lama after it had 
lain there some hours, Robinson was curi- 
ous to taste it, which he did, and found 
that the meat of it was really more tender, 
morejuicy, and more savoury, than if it had 
been roasted on the spit. From that time, 
therefore he constantlv used this method. 

Rich. It is exactly the same way that 
the people of Otaheit^ bake their dogs. 

Mr. Bill. Very true. 

Geo, Their dogs? Do they eat theirdogs.^ 

Rich. Certainly. We read of them last 
winter. Captain Cook's people tasted some 

of

of the flesh of their dogs drest in the man- 
ner, and found it excellent. 

Harriet. Excellent indeed ! 

3Ir. Bill, You know, I suppose, that 
tliese dogs do not feed as ours; they do 
not eat flesh, hut fruits; so that the meat 
of them may taste quite different from the 
flesh of our dogs. 

Well, children, all the preparations for the 
voyage is made. Let our two voyagers rest 
for this night, and to-morrow evening we 
sliall see what may have happened to them. 



TWENTY-THIRD EVENING. 



Robinson andFriday might have been 
asleep about half an hour, when the former 
was suddenly awakened by a violent storm, 
which began and was at the height almost 
in the same instant. The roaring of the 
wind was dreadful, and the earth shook with 
repeated claps of thunder. '*Doyou hear 
this? "said Robinson to Friday, awaking him. 



]36 THE NEW 

*' Heavens ! "replied he, ^'^what would have 
become of us if we had been surprised at sea 
in such weather?" Just at that niomeni tiiey 
heard the report of a gun at a great d i.^tance. 
Friday thought it was thunder; Robin- 
son was firmly persuaded that a gun had 
been fired, and this belief filled him with 
joy. He starts up from bed, runs to the 
fire-place, bids Friday follow him, snatches 
up a burning piece of wood, and mounts 
his ladder of ropes. Friday followed l)is 
master's example, without knowing what 
his intentions were. 

Kobinson made haste to kindle a large 
fire upon the top of the hillock, to signify 
to the people at sea in distress that they 
would find a safe refuge upon that island; 
for he had not the least- doubt that there 
was some ship in distress near at hand, and 
that the report of the gun which he had 
heard was a signal of their danger. Rut 
scarce had the fire began to blaze up before 
there came such a shower of rain as put it 
out in a moment. Robinson and Friday 
were obliged to hasten to the cave, for fear 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. * 137 

of being carried away by the water, which 
ran in floods. The whistling of the wind, 
the roarins: of the waves, the loud bursts of 
thunder, all sound with redoubled tumult; 
and though, in the midst of this tremendous 
"agitation of the elements, Robinson thought 
he could distinguish now and then some re- 
ports of cannon, yet he doubted whether 
it might not be the bursting of thunder 
iit a distance. However, notwithstanding 
hisdoubts, he indulged himself with theflat- 
terring thought that there might be a ship 
near at hand, the captain of which, if he 
escaped the danger of this dreadful storm, 
might take him and his faithful Friday on 
board, and carry them to Europe. Ten 
times he attempted to light the fire, and 
ten times the rain put it out. All that 
remained in his power to do for the unfor- 
tunate people who were struggling against 
shipwreck and death, he did : he prayed 
for them with the greatest devotion. 

Rich, He was not afraid, then, of the 
Storm, as formerly r 

Mr. 



138 THE NEW 

Mr •Bill. No; you see him now per- 
fectly cured of that senseless fear. But how 
was this cure wrought? 

Rich, By his having a clear conscience, 
which reproached him with no crime» 

Mr. Bill. Right; and,[morepver, by a 
firm persuasion that the Almighty is a being 
of the purest benevolence, and that, conse- 
quently, nothing happens to those who are 
endowed with true piety and virtue but what 
conduces finally to their greatest happi- 
ness. — It was day-break before the storm 
ceased. As soon as it was clear, Robinson, 
suspended between hope and fear, went to 
the sea-side, accompanied by Friday, to 
ascertain whether his conjectures were well 
or ill founded. But the first discovery 
that they made filled Robinson with grief, 
and almost plunged Friday into despair. 
The wind had driven their boat out to sea. 
It would have melted any one with com- 
passion 1.0 be witness of Friday's excessive 
grief, when he sawliimself disappointed in 
the pleasing hope of soon returning to his 

father. 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 139 

father. His natural complexion forsook 
his face, and was succeeded by a ghastly 
paleness: he could not utter a single word; 
his eyes were mournfully fixed upon the 
ground ; his whole body was agitated as 
if his soul were striving to part from it, 
and to break the bonds which held them 
united. Suddenly his grief burst forth in 
a flood of tears, and he beats his breast and 
tears his hair, sobbing all the while as if 
his heart would break. 

Robinson had learned from his omti mis- 
fortunes, to feel for those of others, and 
particularly to calm and sooth the sorrows 
of the afflicted. He was touched with 
Friday's excess of grief; he felt for his si- 
tuation, and endeavoured to comfort him 
by exhortations full of tenderness and good 
sense. "Who knows," said he, *' whether 
the loss of our canoe may not be for our 
advantage? Or who can tell of what ser- 
vice this storm, which has carried away our 
boat, may be in its consequences either to 
us or to others?'* '' What service 1" said 

Fridav 



140 THE NEW 

Friday tartly; '* it has deprived us of out- 
canoe, that is all." 

"Then because neither you nor T, narrow 
minded, sliort-sightcd beings as v/e are, can 
perceive a,\iy other effect of the storm than 
the loss of our canoe, do you suppose that 
God, Avhose wisdom is unbounded, had no 
other purpose in view when he stirred up 
this tempest? How can thy feeble under- 
standing dare to judge of and limit the im- 
mense designs of Omnipotence !*' ^' That 
is right," said Friday, '* in a general view ; 
but, as to us in particular, of what service 
can the storm be to us?" ** You must not 
ask me that question. Nothing less than 
omniscience can comprehend the bound- 
less plans of that Being who rules the uni- 
verse. I may, indeed, exhaust myself in 
conjectures, but who will satisfy me whe- 
ther they are just or not? Perhaps there 
might have been raised or gathered over 
our island so great a quantity of dangerous 
exhalations, that nothing less than such a 
storm could disperse them, and thus pre- 
serve

or even from, death itself.. Perhaps this 
boat, the loss of which grieves us so much, 
might only have served to convey us to

hapses ? Is it not sufficient for us to know 
that it is God who raises and lays tlie tem- 
pest at his will, and that in him all crea- 
tures have a M'ise and tender father?" 

Friday, recovering his composure, was 
ashamed of his error, repented of liis mur- 
murs, and submitted to the decree of Pro- 
vidence. In the mean time, Robinson did 
not cease to cast his eyes round to every 
part of the vast ocean that was open to his 
view ; he could not help looking out for 
some vessel ; but there was not the smallest 
appearance of one. He concluded, there- 
fore, that he had been mistaken, and that 
what he had supposed to be the report of 
guns had certainly been thunder. Grieved 
at the thought of giving up so agreeable a 
hope, he returned sorrowfully towards his 
habitation. 

But 



142 THE NEW 

But even here he was not at ease; his 
fancy still ran upon a vessel at anchor near 
the island. He went up, therefore, to 
the top of the hillock, from whence there 
was a full view of all the Western coast, but 
lie could discern nothing that flattered his 
liopes. Still vexed and uneasy, he went to 
a very high hill, from the top of which he 
could view the Eastern coast, and climbing 
with all speed up to the summit, he casts 
his eyes round the sea — But heavens ! 
what is his joy when he discovers that he 
has not been mistaken ! 

The Children. Oh dear ! 

Mr. Bill. He sees a ship, and notwith- 
standingthedistance, he sees it sodistinctly 
as to be convinced that it is one, and of 
pretty large burthen. You will excuse me, 
my dears, if I forbear attempting to de- 
scribe the excessive transports of his joy. 
He flies like lightning to his cave, and ar- 
rives quite out of breath. He snatches 
up his arms, without which he never went 
to any great distance, and unable to say 

any

any more to Friday, who was astonished to 
see him in such a hurry, than these words, 
** There they are! quick ! quick !" he 
remounts the ladder of ropes, and sets off 
again with the utmost precipitation. 

From his master's Imrry and confusion, 
and the few words that he spoke, Friday 
supposed the savages to be at hand ; 
taking up his arms, therefore, he followed 
him with all speed. 

They had at least twelve miles to go be- 
fore they came to that part of the shore 
off which the vessel seemed to lie at an- 
chor ; nor did Frida}' learn the cause of his 
master's hurry until he arrived at this spot. 
Robinson shewed him the ship at a dis* 
tance. Friday could not conceal his asto- 
nishment; for, notwithstanding the dis- 
tance, he guessed it must be at least a hun- 
dred times bigger than any thing which he 
had ever seen of the kind. 

Robinson expressed hisjoy in a thousand 
different ways; sometimes he danced, some- 
times 



144 THE N^EW 

times he baUoo'd, ^ind sometimes he em- 
braced Friday with tears in his eyes, and 
congratulated the good fortune of both. 
Now, indeed, they should' setf off for Eu* 
Vope, and come to England ! Now Friday 
should see how the people live in that 
country ! what houses they inhabit, and 
how they pass their time in peace, enjoy- 
ing all the conveniences and pleasures of 
life ! Thus he ran on withiOiit stopping, and 
would perhaps have talked for an hour, had 
hettot recollected, that to lose the precious 
time in useless words was now particularly 
unreasonable, and that he ought, by every 
method in his pov^er, to endeavour to make 
himself 'visible to the people in the ship^ 
But how was this to be done? Here was 
what puzzled him. 

He endeavoured to make them hear him, 
but to no purpose, though the wind had 
changed during the, storm, and blew, at 
present, off the island towards the ship. 
He then begged his friend to make a fire 
directly, which might be seen by the people 

on 



ROBIKSOK CRUSOE. 145 

on boanl. This was quickly done; and they 
kindled a blaze that rose as high as the tops 
of the trees. He had his eyes constantly 
fixed upon the ship, expecting every mo- 
ment to see them lower a boat, and send 
it to\rards the shore. But his expectations 
were all in vain. 

At last, as the fire had been lighted now- 
more than an hour M'ithout any appearance 
of a boat, Friday oftered to swim to the 
ship, notwithstanding its distance, and in- 
vite the crew to come on shore. Robinson 
joyfully consented to this, on condition, 
however, that he should take care not to 
expose himself rashly, nor neglect any 
thing for the preservation of his life. Im- 
mediately Friday strips off his cloaths of 
matting, cuts a branch, and, holding it be- 
tween his teeth, springs boldly into tl>€ 
waves. Robinson accompanied him with 
his eyes and most friendly wishes. 

Charlotte. But why the branch, papa? 

Air, Bill, A green branch is, among the 
savages, a sign of peace. He who ap-

proacl)es them with a bougli in his liand 
lias notliing to fear from them. It was for 
Ills security, therefore, that Friday took 
this precaution. 

lie arrived safe at the vessel, and swam 
round it twice or thrice, calhng the people, 
but nobody answered. Perceiving the lad- 
der at the ship's side, he went up by it, 
holding the branch in liis hand. 

When he was high enough to see all over 
the deck, he was frightened at the sight of 
an animal, such as he had never seen in his 
life; it was covered with black woolly hair, 
and as soon as it saw Friday, it uttered such 
noises as perfectly surprized him. However, 
it soon ceased crying out, and appeared so 
iTiild and so engaging, that Friday was now 
no longer afraid of it: the creature ap- 
proached in a manner so humble, and crept 
along wagging its tail and whining so plain- 
tively, that Friday supposed it to be entreat- 
ing his help and protection. When it had 
crept close up to him, and stopped, Friday 
ventured to pat it, and the creature seemed 

transported 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 14/ 

transported with joy. Friday walked all 
over the deck, calling the peo|)le, but no- 
body appeared. While he was lost in ad- 
miration of the many surprising.objects that 
he saw on the deck, and was standing with 
his back to the hatch wa}'', he received, all 
of a sudden, so violent a blow behind, that 
he fellflat on his face. Getting up in a 
great fright, he looks round him, and 
stands petrified with consternation, on be- 
holding a creature of apretty large size, with 
crooked horns, and a long bushy beard, 
rearing itself upon its hind legs, and pre- 
paring, Avith a threatening air, to make a 
second attack upon him. Friday roared 
out as loud as he was able, and jumped 
into the sea. 

The first of these animals, which. was 
black, and which I need not name, as, no 
doubt, you know vvhat it is, from the de- 
scription that I have given you of it 

lik'h. Oh ! it was a water spaniel. 

Mr» Bi/L You have guessed it. The 
spaniel, in imitation of Friday, jumps also 
into the water, and swims after him, Fri- 



us Tllli: NEW 

(lay, licaring the noise of something that 
fell into the water behind him, imagined 
the horned monster to be pursuing* him. 
lie was so terrified at the thought, that he 
was scarce able to swim, and ran great 
danger of drowning; a fresh instance from 
which we see h.ow hurtful the passion of fear 
is, since it harries us into dangers to whicli 
^vc sliould never be exposed, if we did not 
suffer ourselves to be overpowered by it.' 

He did not even dare to look behind 
him: liowever, after he had a little reco- 
vered from his fright, he swam so fast that 
the spaniel could scarcely keep tip with 
liim. When he reached the shore, being 
unable to speak, he fell down quite s[)ent 
at Robinson's feet. The spaniel landed a 
few minutes after. 

Ivobinson spared no pains to bring liis 
faithful companion to himself He rubbed 
his temples, shook him, and called him 
aloud by his name. But it was some time 
before Friday opened his eyes and spoke. 
As soon as he was able, he began to relate 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 14^ 

the terrible adventure thathad happened to 
him ; how the ship appeared to him a great 
mountain of wood, on which stood up tliree 
large trees (meaning the masts); how the 
black creature had shewn him a thousand 
marks of fondness ; and how the monster 
with the beard and horns had attempted to 
kill him : lastly, he added, that he believ- 
ed tlie monster to be master of the floating- 
mountain of wood, as he sawiio man on it. 
Robinson listened to him with a good 
deal of surprise. The horned monster he 
supposed to be a goat. As to th'esliip, he 
concluded that it was fast upon a rock or 
sand bank, and that the crew, fearing to 
be wrecked, had quitted it, and taken to 
their boats for safety, but he could not 
conceive what was become of them. If 
they had reached the island, the spot where 
he then stood with Fritlay was the most likely 
place for their landing; but he could per- 
ceive no traces of them. If they had pe- 
rislied.yet eithertheir bodies or their boats, 
or both, would, in all probability, have 
II 3 been 



150 



TffE NLW 



been tlirown upon some part of the shore. 
However, at length, he recollected that 
the wind had changed during the storm, 
and from an east^riy gale, had sliifted sud- 
dj^nly to west. This. circumstance seemed 
to explain to him wliat he found so mucli 
•dii^culty in copiiprehcnding at first. 

\' Certainly," said ])e to himself, '' the 
people wlio took to th.eir boats must have 
been driven back by the westerly gale from 
reaching the sljore; the, wind must, have 
carried them eastward; so that, perhaps, 
they have perished in the open sea; per- 
haps they were carried away by some cur- 
rent; or, perliaps, before tlie shifting of the 
wind, they might have touched on one of 
the islands to the westward. Heaven grant 
that tliis last conjecture be true!" cried he 
with a sigh. And he communicated his 
opinion to Friday, ^v]lo thought it not im- 
probable. 

" But what are we to dor" said Robin- 
son. ** Wh.ether the crew have perished, 
or are only tossed about by the winds, in ei-

ther case we can do nothing better than un- 
load the ship of whatever effects we can 
move. ' But how are we to~ attempt this 
now tliat we have no canoe?" At tliat mo- 
ment he felt for the loss of his canoe almost 
as much as Friday had a few hours before; 
he thought of every method possible either 
to replace it, or to substitute something else 
in its room; but lie was along time without 
hitting upon any thing that would answer* 
To build another canoe would take up 
too much time. To swim to the ship was 
an attempt that he durst not undertake on- 
account of the distance. Besides, what 
could he expect to save by doing so? 

Rich, I know very well what I would 
liave done ? 

Air. BilL Well, what would you have 
done? 

Rick, I would have made a raft. 

J/r. BilL That was precisely the idea 
that struck Robinson at last. " A raft/* 
said he to himself, ** will be soonest made." 

He my. Now, what is a raft ? 

H 4 . Rich. 



Rich. A raft' is a huinbtt of beams tied 
close together, so' that' one can walk upon 
them, and this will carry you upon the wa- 
ter as well as a boat. - ' " - 

Aifr. Bill. You are A^er}^ right; and just 
sucli a raft djd Robinson intend to make to 
carry him to the ship, that he might save 
whatever goo^ls he could bring away. It 
was resolved that one oF them should go to' 
the cave and bring back provisions for a 
tlay, as well as all the cordage and tools that'* 
he should find. As Friday was the more 
active of the two, he was charged with this 
business; and while he performed it, Robin- 
son cut down trees proper for the raft. 

Friday could not be back before night- 
fall : in the mean time Robinson was much 
delighted with the spaniel, for which he felt 
a kind regard as coming from Europe. 

The spaniel, for its part, seemed perfectly- 
happy in meeting with so good a master, 
and played a number of amusing'tricks be- 
fore Robinson. At Friday's return, Robin- 
son gave^ Jt.he spaniel part of his supper, 
' ' ' "- thousfh

though this was the first fqpd that he had 
tasted hjpnself the whole. day. Luckily it 
happened to be a moon-Jight night; they 
both, therefore, worked without ceasing till 
near midnight, when they found themselve 
so overpowered with sleep, that they could 
no longer resist its approaches. 

E(lu\ I do not wonder at that; they 
had not slept the whole night before. 

Geo. Besides, theyhad been stirring about, 
so much all the day, especially Friday. 

Mr, Bill, They lay down upon the grass, 
and the spaniel at their feet, as their guard. 
Thus, till the return of the dawn, they re- . 
freshed their bodies, and gathered new 
strength in sound and undisturbed repose.

TWENTY-FOURTH EVENING 



3IR. bill. Scarce had the ruddy morn- 
ing began to appear in the eastern part of 
the horizon, when the wakeful Robinson 
roused his companion to go on with the work 
vhich they had begun the day before. Tliey 
Vorked so incessantly the whole day that 
the raft was finished that very evening. 

They had joined a double roM^ of trunks of 
trees together in such a manner with cords 
and willow twigs, that it formed, as it were, 
a solid floor, fit to lie even on the water, 
and about twenty feet long, with nearly 
tlie same breadth. Thev had also been 
careful to construct this raft upon rollers 
close to the beach, that they might the more 
easily set it afloat without loss of time. 

Fortunately, the tide was on the ebb about 
break of day. They did not delay a mo- 
ment in launching their raft, that they might 

have 



ts 




ROBINSON CRUSOE. 155 

have the advantage of the ebb, which, hke 
a current, would carry them out towardsi 
the ship. They push off, are now upon 
the open sea, and in less than half an hear 
come along side of the ship. 

What were Robinson's teelings when he 
approached thisEuropean vessel! lie would 
have kissed it, and glued his lips to every 
part of it if possible! That it came from 
Europe, was built, manned, and conveyed 
thither by Europeans, were circumstances 
which could not fail to render it dear to 
him But, alas! these Europeans them- 
selves had disappeared — perhaps had been 
swallowed up by the waves; an afflicting 
surmise to Robinson, who would cheerfully 
have sacrificed half the days that he had 
still to live, on condition of finding; the 
crew,ancl setting sail with them for Europe. 
But as he was obliged to give up this hope, 
it only remained for him now to save as 
much of the goods ou. of the ship as he 
could for his own use. 

Geo. But could he take possession of 
goods that did not belong to him ?

out of the ship, and tarry them ashore; but 
if the owners appeared, l^ewas obliged to 
restore them^ ,,, :.r> t 

Mr. Bill Thus justice decrees certainly. 
li he did not take out the goods, tliey would 
be spoiled by degrees in the sea-water; he 
had, therefore, some right to the use of 
them; he might, without any scruple^ take 
10 himself whatever he found most ne-* 
cessar^', and keep it, looking upon it as a 
recompence, which the owners, if ever they 
appeared, could not justly refus^e him for< 
the trouble that he had taken in saving the 
remainder of the cargo. 

As to what concerns shipwrecks in ge- 
neral, the following customs are observed 
in some civilized states. The shipwrecked 
goodsaregencrally divided into three partsf 
the first for the owners, if living, or, if not, i 
lor their heirs; the second is given to those 

who 



»0Blir901f CliUSOE. 157 

who have saved the goods; anil the last 
belongs to the sovereign of the country. ^ 

Edzo. The sovereign! Why has he a 
share ? 

Mr, Bill, That is a cjuestioh to which T 
cannot, at present, give you a very satisfac- 
tory answer; however, I will inform you of 
every thing on the subject that is within 
your comprehension. The prince or sove-' 
reign of the country, by whatever title he' 
is styled, maintains upon his coasts a num-' 
ber of persons who are obliged, by their' 
station, to look after shipwrecked goods,* 
that none of them be carried off, but that 
whatevei* is saved may be lodged in a place' 
of security. Without this precaution, the 
merchant to whom the cargo belongs would 
seldom recover any part of it, because the 
goods would always be either stolen or' 
spoiled. Now, as the sovereign is at the' 
chiarge of maintaining these people, it is » 
but just that be should be indemnified by' 
those who reap the advantage of so experl-^ 
sive an establishment. For this reason, it 
has been regulated in some countries, that 



158 THE NEW 

the third part of shipwrecked goods should 
helong* to the sovereign of the place. 

Consequently, Robinson was authorized 
to appropriate to himself two-thirds of the 
goods that he might be able to recover 
out of the ship, and to apply then) to what- 
ever use should seem best to him, as being 
his lawful property. 

Rich, Two- thirds ? 

Mr. BilL Yes; one-third for his pains 
and trouble, and the other, as being the 
only lawful sovereign of the island near 
which the vessel had been wrecked. 

Edw, But who made him sovereign of 
the island ? 

Mr. BilL Common sense. A country, 
like any thing else, which has no ownen 
naturally belongs to him who first takes 
possession of it ; and such was exactly the 
case here. 

When Robinson was a little recovered 
from the excess of joy which he felt at the 
sight of an European ship, his first wish was 
that it might not prove to be damaged, but 

capable 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1.59 

capable of being set afloat. In this case he 
-was resolved to embark in it with Frida}^ 
and set sail, if not for Europe, at least for 
some European colony in South America, 
or the West Indies^, notwithstanding the 
danger of being in the open sea in a ship 
without sufficient hands to work it, and 
withouthaving the knowledge of navigation 
which a sea-voyage requires. He sailed 
round the ship on his raft, and examined 
the depth of water about it, but had the 
mortification to be convinced that he must 
never expect to see it afloat again. 

The storm had lodged it between two 
rocks, where it was jammed in so fast, that 
there was not the least possibility of moving 
it one way or the other, and it was likely to 
remain in itspresentsituation until theforce 
of the waves should disengage it by dashing 
it in pieces. Disappointed in all his hopes 
for the preservation of the ship, Robinson 
hastened aboard to examine the cargo, and 
see whether that was damaged. Friday still 
remembered his fright so strongly, that.he

could sqarccly persuc^cle^^himself to accom- 
pany his master upon deck. He ventured, 
however, at last, though not without trem- 
bling, as the first object that met his eyei 
was the terrible horned iponster. 

But he was np longer so fierce as before: 
hcAs^as lain down, and seemed exceedingly 
weak and hardly able to rise. The fact 
was, that, for three days past, nobody being 
at hand to give him his usual food, he had 
received little or no nourishment, Robin- 
son, who suspected this to be the case, the 
moment he saw the animal's enfeebled state, 
made it his first care to seek for something 
to appease its hunger. As he was very 
well acquainted with the inside of a ship, 
he was not long in finding what he sought, 
and had the pleasure to see the goat devour 
with the greatest eagerness what he brought 
it : while Friday, for his part, could never 
sufficiently admire the odd figure of the 
animal, as he thought it, having never seen 
any thing like it before. 

Robinson began next to take a survey of 

the

the ship; he \yent ft l>tvi deck i6 cJe'ck, jiticT 
from cabin to cabin, auB foiinc! every wh^re; ^ 
a thousand tilings, which, in Europe, 6ne " 
would scarce think worth looking ixt, but' 
which to him were of infinite importance/ 
In one part was a stock of biscuit, ficle, 
flour, corn, wine, gunpowder, balls, ^hdt^ 
in another place wereship cannon, muskets^ 
pistols, swords, hangers, and cutlasses; 
eUewhere there were hatchets, saws, pin-; 
cers, gimlets, rasps, planes, hammers, iron 
bars, nails, knives, scissars, needles, and 
pins. Farther on, he sees pots, porringers, 
plates, spoons, tongs, bellows, fire-shovek, 
and other kitchen utensils, some of wood, 
others of iron, tin, and copper. Lastly, 
he fitids chests full of cloaths, linen, stock- 
ings, shoes, boots, and a number of other 
things, fof any single one of which, if it 
had been offered to him for sale, Robinson 
would freely have given his lump of gold* 
which he had long since forgotten. 

Friday was lost in amaze at the sight of so 
many objects, all equally unknown to him 
and the uses of which he could not so much 



169, THE NEW 

as guess. Robinson, on tlie other hand, 
could not contain himself; he wept for joy: 
likea child, he touched every thing-, snatch- 
ed up every thing, but laid it down as soon 
as he saw any thing else that he liked bet- 
ter. He was going, at last, down to the 
hold, but found a considerable quantity of 
water in it; a proof that there was a leak 
in the ship's bottom. 

lie considered what he had best carrv 
ashore in this his first trip, and found some 
difficulty in making his choice. Now he 
thought one thing most indispensably ne- 
cessary, now another, and frequently rejects 
what he had just preferred, and makes it 
give place to another, which isalso rejected 
in its turn. At length, however, his choice 
was fixed upon the following objects, as 
"being to him the most valuable of any that 
he could carry away; 1st. two barrels, oneof 
gunpowder, theother of shot: 2d. two mus-u 
kets, tw^o brace of pistols, two hangers, and 
two cutlasses; 3d. two suitsof cloaths, com- 
plete, for himself and Friday; 4th. tv»'o dozen

ot' shirts; 5t]i. two hatchets, two saws, two 
planes, two iron bars, some hammers, and 
several other iron tools; 6th. some books, 
paper, pens, and ink ; 7th. a tinder-box, 
with matches, flint, and steel; Sth.ahogs- 
liead of biscuit; 9th. some pieces of sail 
cloth ; 10th. and last, the goat. 

Henry. The goat ? Oh ! he could have 
done without the goat. 

Mr, Bill. That is very true, Henry; 
but the goat could not so well have done 
without him. Robinson was too compas- 
sionate to leave the poor creature exposed 
to the danger of perishing with the ship, 
which might be sunk before he came back. 
Besides, there was room for her (for it was 
a she goat; on the raft after it had been 
loaded with every thing that seemed to 
claim his greatest regard. No ! he did 
not forget the poor goat — he carried her 
with him. 

But he disdained to take many articles 
which in Europe would have been eagerly 
seized the first of all. A barrel of gold 

dust, 



1^4 ' THE NEW 

dust, and u casket of the most valuabk 
diamonds, he found amongst tlie captain's 
effects, but was in no wise tempted to take 
them away, as they could not possibly be 
of any service to him. 

He had employed so much time in exa- 
mining the ship, in opening and emptying 
the chests, in indulging his joy and admi- 
ration, in chusing and placing upon the 
raft Avhat he had a mind to carry away, 
that, when all was done, lie had only an 
hour to spare before the tide would begin 
to flow again. They were obliged to take 
the advantage of it ; for, without the flow 
of the tide, they would hardly be able to 
gain the shore. Robinson spent this hour 
in (lining afcer the European fashion, which 
he liad not done for a long time. before. 

He brought out, therefore, a piece of 
hung beef, a few herrings, some biscuit, 
butter, cheese, and a bottle of wine, and, 
laid the whole upon a table in the cabin. 
Friday and he sat down upon chairs. The 
very circumstance of dining at a tabic, sit- 
ting 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ]6j 

ting upon chairs, having plates, helping 
themselves with knives and forks ; in short, 
of makind' a meal with theadvantao^e of so 
many European co^iyeniences, gave Robin- 
son a pleasure that it would be impossible 
to express : not to mention the victuals, 
particularly the bread, which had been so 
often in vain the object of his wishes. You 
cannot imagine how delicious tliey tasted 
to his palate. One should, like him, be 
deprived for nine years successively of all 
those sorts of food, and all those conve- 
niences, in order to conceive, in its full 
extent, the luxury that he enjoyed. 

Friday, who knew nothing of the Euro- 
pean manner of eating, was very much puz- 
zled in handling his knife^ and still more his 
fork. Robinson shewed him how to use 
them ; but Friday, endeavouring to imitate 
him, and to put a bit of meat into his mouth 
with the fork, from pure habit lifted uphi^j 
hand with the handle of the fork to his lips, i 
while the piece of meat went oif towards hi*- 
ear. Robinson having made Friday taste 

the 



l66 TliJE NEM^ 

the wine, he firmly refused to drink any 
of it: accustomed, as he was, to spring 
water, his palate could not hear the fiery 
strength of a fermented liquor. The bis- 
cuit, on the other hand, was quite to his 
taste. 

Tlie tide now beginning to flow, they 
get upon the raft, push off, and are carried 
gently towards the island. In a short time 
the}' come to shore, and hasten to land the 
goods with which the raft was loaded. 

Friday was very curious to know the 
meaning of all those things and their uses. 
To satisfy his curiosity, Robinson goes out 
of sight behind a bush, and dresses himself 
in a shirt, stockings, and shoes, togetherwith 
an officer's uniform complete; then, put- 
ting a laced hat upon his head, and a sword 
by his side, he comes, all at once, and shews 
himself to Friday. Seized with astonish- 
ment, Friday starts back a few paces, doubt- 
ing, at first sight, w hether it were really his 
master, or some being above the human 
species. Robinson could not help laughing 

at 



-KOBIXSON GRUSOE. 16? 

at his amazement ; lie held his hand out to 
hiiii in a friendly manner, assuring him that 
he was still the same, still his friend Robin- 
son, though he had undergone a change of 
dress, and, in some measure, of fortune. 
He gave him a suit of sailor's cloaths, shew- 
ed him the use of each part, and desired 
him also to retire behind the thicket and 
change his dress. 

Friday went accordingly; but, how long 
was he dressing ! and how many trials did 
he make ! He put on each part of the d ress 
wrong : for instance, he put his two legs 
through the sleeves of the shirt, ran his 
two arms into the breeches, covered his 
head with the seat of them, and tried 
to button the jacket behind. What awk- 
ward attempts at dressing! However, he 
was fortunate enough to correct all his 
mistakes, and^ at length, dressed himself 
properly at all points.. 

He jumped for joy, like a child, when he 
saw how well he was cloathed, how conve- 
nient and easy his dress was to the body, 

and 



l69 THE NKW 

and how proper to defend him from the 
stings of muskitoes. The shoes alone were 
disagreeable to him; he thought them in- 
convenient and useless. He begged leave, 
therefore, to put them off, and Robinson 
gave him full permission to do in that re- 
spect whatever he pleased. 

He also shewed him the use of the hatch- 
ets and several other tools, with which he 
Avas quite delighted. They began to make 
immediate use of them, in cutting a mast 
for their raft, that, with the help of a sail, 
they might, for the future, be able to go to 
and from the ship without being obliged to 
-wait for the ebb and flow of the tide. Ro- 
binson undertook this task alone, and sent 
Friday to his dwelling place to milk the 
lamas, which they had neglected for two 
days past. 

During his absence, Robinson loaded one 
of the muskets. He proposed to have the 
pleasure of surprising his friend with the 
astonishing effects of gunpowder. As Fri- 
day, at his return, was admiring the dis- 
patch 



ROBINSON CKUSOE. 169 

patch with which llohlnsbn had fihished his 
work, the latter perceived a sea-gull flying 
away with a fish that he had seized out of 
the water. He snatches up his musket, 
and says to Friday, *' Do you see that sea- 
gull? He shall fall this moment/' And so 
saying, he levels at the hird, draws the 
trigger, and fires. The sea-gull falls. 

Imagine, if you can Friday's terror and 
surprise. He fell down as if it were him- 
self that had been shot. Immediately his 
old superstition revived concerning 7b wj&flr;?, 
who produces the thunder. Astonished 
and confused as he was, he took his master 
foi' Toupan. He raised himself up on his 
kiiees, and held out his hands, in a trembling 
and suppliant manner, towards Robinson, 
without being able to, utter a single word. 

Robinson was far from making a joke of 
any thing that concerned religion, though 
ever so erroneous. The moment, therefore, 
that he suspected Friday's superstitious 
notions, he was vexed that he had not pre- 
viously informed him of what he was going 

Vol. ir. I to 



170 THE NEW 

to do wlien he firccl^ and, therefore, liasten- 
ed to clear up his mistake. He raised him 
ill a iVicndly manner, embraced him af- 
fectionately, bid him take courage and 
cease trembling; and added, that he would 
teach him, in a moment, how to make the 
same thunder and lightning ; for there was 
nothing but what was perfectly natural in 
every thing he had seen and heard, lie ex- 
plained to him the nature and effects of 
gunpowder; shewed him the construction 
of the gun ; and, loading it in his presence, 
gave it to him, that he might fire it off. 
Eut Friday was still in too great a fright, 
and begged Robinson to try the experiment 
in his stead. He, therefore, setup a mark 
about a hundred yards off, and fired v^'hile 
Friday stood by his side. 

He was very near falling a second time, 
so terrible did what he saw and heard ap- 
pear to him. There were several grains of 
shot in the mark, which had entered pretty 
deeply into the wood. Robinson, having 
remarked this to him, made him perceive 

how 



ROBINSON CRUSOE* I7i 

how secure they must be for the future 
against all attacks of the savages, while 
they had this artificial thunder and light- 
ning in their power. What he was now wit- 
ness to, and what he had seen in the ship, 
inspired him with so profound a veneratioa 
for Europeans in general, and Robinson in 
})articular, that for some days he could not 
recover that air of familiarity which he had 
usually kept up with his friend. Night 
coming on put an end to the agreeable la- 
bours of this happy day. 



TWENTY-FIFTH EVENING. 



Mr, bill, I suppose it will be agree- 
able to you, my dear children, if I begin 
directly, and without any preface, upon 
our friend Robinson's affairs. . 

I 2 He 



17^ t VIE "HSi&St • 

He had not ever since hi&tGoming to the 
island enjoyed a more Agreeable night's 
rest than the last, because he had not 
seen himself so happy as at present ; and 
never was man more touched with love and 
gratitude towards his Supreme Benefactor, 
to whom he was indebted for this happiness. 
How often, when alone, did he offer up 
his thauks, in the most respectful posture, 
to the Heavenly Disposer of all Things, for 
the blessings that he had vouchsafed him! 
Nor was he content with feeling these seJi'- 
timents of gratitude himself, he endeavour- 
ed also to communicate them to Friday. 
With this view, he taught him, before 
they went to rest, a prayer of thanksgiving, 
which they both repeated with softened 
and grateful hearts, to praise the Supreme 
Being, the Universal Faither of Nature. 

The next morning they rose pretty eaily, 
and carried all their goods into a coppice, 
where they covered them with boughs of 
trees to secure them from the rain if it 

should 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 173 

should fall, and then set off with the first 
ebb to return to the wreck. 

I forgot to tell you that they had provid- 
ed themselves with oars, so that this trip 
was made in much less time than the for- 
mer, and to the full as fortunately. They 
took care, in the first place, to lower doMii 
upon their raft all the planks that thoy 
could find in the ship, with which tlay 
might cover the raft as it were with ano- 
ther floor, and so keep the goods muqh 
drier than those which they had carried 
away the day before, 

Robinson examined the cargo afresh, to 
cliuse whatever he should think prcferal)le 
in so great a quantity of goods, which he 
could not carry away all at once., He wa^s 
not, indeed, so much puzzled this time, as 
he had already secured the most necessary 
articles ; however, he chose nothing with- 
out fully weii>hino' the value of It. 

Amongst other things he resolved to 
carry away one of the six small carriage 
guns that were in the ship. 

13 Rich, 



174 Tin: new 

Etch. A gun ! I t'hink he might liave 
carriefl away sometliiiig more useful. 

J/r BllL Yes, so we may think who 
see things at a distance. Rohinson, on 
the contrary, who ju(l;>"ed of his situation 
from a nciirer viev/ of it, thought this gvm 
a very necessary article, were it only for 
bis ease and security. 

lOclu Ffow so ? 

Mr, Bill, The part of the shore, where 
he was ohjiged for the present to lodge 
what goods lie had brought out of the ship, 
was open on every side, and, unfortunately, 
at no great distance fiom the spot where 
the savages used to land. Hq might, indeed, 
depend with tolerable security upon the use 
of his guns and pistols, in case of an attack, 
but the idea that he should be thereby re- 
duced to thexruel necessity of killing some 
of t-liose unhappy savages, nradc him shud- 
der whenever he thought of it. His de- 
sign was, therefore, in having a piece of 
cannon on the shore, to fire a ball over 
their heads when they approached the island 

in 



ROBINSON CllUSO.^.. 175 

in their canoes, and so terrify them, and 
make them perhaps slieer off and return to 
their own country. 

You see now, my dear Richard, how 
liable we are to be mistaken, when we take 
upon us to giv^e an opinion concerning the 
behaviour of other persons. Wc very Sel- 
dom know^ all the motives that induce a 
man to act; how can wc, therefore, be so 
presumptuous as to set up for judges of 
his actions? A wise man thinks tliat lie 
can never be too circumspect in the judg- 
ment which he passes upon the conduct of 
other persons ; he even forbears to give 
an opinion, unless he be obliged ; he is sen- 
sible tiiat he lias enough to do to look to 
himself and his own affairs; and tlius, my 
dear children, we will endeavour to act 
for the future. 

Besides the piece of cannon, they placed 

also upon the raft the following articles : 

1st. three small bags, one of rye, anotlier 

of barley, and the la^t of pease; 2d. a 

1-4. chest 



J 7^ - THE NEW 

chest of nails and screws ; 3(1. a dozen of 
liatchets ; 4th. a barrel of gunpowder, 
with balls and sliot; 5th. a sail; 6th. a 
grindstone. 

Rich. Why that? 

Mr. Bill. To sharpen knives, hatchets, 
and other tools, when they required it. 

Rich. Were there no btones upon the 
island ? 

Mi\ Bill Yes, plenty; but none fit for 
sharpening their instruments. Have not 
you observed that those stones which ar« 
used for that purpose are of a particular 
sort, and much softer than most others } 

Rich, Yes, I have. 

Mr. BUL'WgI], Robinson had never yet 
found upon his island any of that sort of 
stone, which has less hardness than stone in 
general, and seems composed of grains of 
sand. But a grindstone is not only exceed- 
ingly useful, but indispensably necessary to 
those who make use of sharp iron tools. 
He preferred it, therefore, without hesita- 
tion, 



ROBINSON eRUSOE. 177 

tion, to the gold-dust and diamonds, wliicli 
he had valued so little before, and had left 
behind him in his first trip to the vessel. 

Before he set off to return, Robinson ex- 
amined the condition of the ship. He 
found that the leak was gaining ground, 
and that the rubbing of her sides against 
the rock, occasioned by the motion x)f the 
waves, had already loosened and started se* 
veral planks He foresaw, therefore, that 
the first gust of wind would dash the ship 
to pieces, and concluded that he must be 
expeditious if he wished to save mucli more 
of the cargo. 

As the wind blew then towards sliore, 
they were able to reach it solely by the as- 
sistance of their sajl and oars, thougli the 
ebb, which had scarce run half down, was 
against them. In their way to the shore,. 
Robinson blamed himselt much for one 
thing. His way of thinking here proves hiiu 
to have been a perfect lover of justice. 

Edzv. For what did he blame himself,, 
papa ? 

1 5 Mi\ 



17vS TliE XL\^ 

Mr. Bill, For not. carrying away the 
i>:old-dust and diamonds. 

Ediv. What would he have done witli 
them ? 

Mr, Bill, He had no view of using these 
things liimself, but he reasoned thus: ^'It 
is not absoluteiy impossible," said lie, '*that 
tlie captain of the vessel may be still alive, 
ami come some da}^ or other to examine 
whether he cannot save part of the cargo. 
If a gale of wind were to rise and dash 
the sljip to pieces before you could go 
back to it, and I bus the diamonds and 
gold-dust v/ere to be lost, how could you 
justify yourself to tlie owner and to your 
ou'n conscience, for having thought merely 
of savin [4- what might l^c of use to yourself^ 
wilhoui paying the least attention to his in- 
terest by saving, the goods that would be 
most valuable to him ? Perhaps his fortune, 
and that of nvar.y otlii^r persons,. depend on 
this slight instance of attention which you

himself, " how far art thou still from being 
as just as thou oughtest to be !" 

Ke was on the point of pushing back 
again before he landed, his conscience wa>? 
so touched at his neglecting a duty which 
he with reason looked upon as sacred. 

In the mean time they approached the 
shore, and, just as they were about to land, 
they ran the risk of seeing all their goods 
lost in the sea ; for as it continued still to 
ebb, and the depth of the water lessened 
every moment, the headmost part of the raft 
was soon upon the dry sand, and, conse- 
quently, higher than the sternmost, which 
was supported by the water, that was falling 
every'instant. Luckily Robinson and Fri- 
day were both astern, and, tltei oTorc, abje to 
stop the goods which were slipping oif, and 
to keep them from rolling into the sea. 

After they had nuide all things steady, 
they were obliged to walk in the water and 
mud up to the knees beforethey could get 
them ashore. By their care andprecaution 
in this business, nothing Was either lost or 
I 6 damaged. 



180 THE XEW 

damaged, and they were ready to put to 
sea again before the return of the tide. 

Robinson was no sooner aboard the ship 
but he hastened to convey upon the raft 
the band of gold-dust and the casket of 
jewels; and, having thus relieved his con- 
science ofa loadwhich lay upon it, he thought 
he had now a right to think of himself 

In tliis trip he carried away, among other 
articles, some wheel- barrows which happen- 
eil to be aboard, I know not for what use; 
a great quantity of cloatlis and linen ; a 
number of tools and pieces of furniture ; a 
lantern, and all the papers that were in the 
Captain's cabin. As the tide was now flov/- 
ing up, they set sail, and, having the ad- 
vantage of wind and ; tide, they were 
qaiokly ashore. 

Robinson spent the rest of the day in 
taking a precaution which he thought in- 
dispensably necessary. He trembled at the 
idea, tliat, Avere a heavy sliower to come on, 
hesbouid be disabled from using. what he 
counted the most valuable of all his effects, 

namely. 



ROBINSON CaaUSOE. ISl 

namely, bis gtinp<)vt^derv' To prevent such 
an accident, lie resblv'ed that A'ery day to 
make a tent of a large sailcloth^'hiclr-he 
had saved, and to lodge his treasure lindet* 
it, where it would be S'afely sheltered from 
the rain. 

As he was novv^ provided with scissars'and 
Avith needle and thread, this work was soon 
finished, and Friday was not long before 
he knew enough of it to be able to assist 
him. He could not sufficiently ttdmire the 
admirable invention of the needle and scis- 
sars; and frequently declared, that in com- 
parison of the industrious Europeans, he 
and his countrymen were no better than 
poor idiots. 

They finished the tent before sun-s€t,and 
Robinson had stiM time to shew Friday the 
effect of a great gun. He charged itvvith 
a ball, and pointed the muzzle towards the 
sea, that the ball might skimthe surface of 
the water, and Friday might see'distinctly 
how far the gun would carry. Robinson 
put fire to the touch-hole, and though Fri- 
day 



182 THE NEW 

flay was already in some measure prepared 
for it I)y two shots from tlie musket, yet 
the explosion being now much 1. aider, terri- 
fied him so much, that he tremhied from 
head to foot. The ball marked its course 
on the surface of the water by lightly dip- 
ping and rebounding until it was out of 
sii^ht. Friday affirmed, that a single shot 
like this would be sufficient to turn his 
wiiole nationof couniynjen to sudden 
flight, It they were even approaching by 
thousands: because they would not hiive a 
doubt that he who could produce such 
thunder must certainly be Toupan. 

After nigiit fall, Robinson put a light in 
his lantern to cast -an eye over the paj)ers 
that he had saved, inorxler to discover the 
ship's destination, and to \vhom she belong- 
ed : but, unfortunately, all these papers, as 
well as the books, were written in a lan- 
guao:e tliat he did not understand. Here, 
therelbre he had fresh occasion to be sorry 
for having neglected the study of foreign 
languages when he might have learnt them 

But 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. J 83 

But this sorrow, coming too late, was of no 
use. 

Two circumstances, however, which he 
observed, gave him some information con- 
cerning the ship's destination, and the ob- 
ject of her voyage. He found amongst 
others, some letters for persons in Barba- 
does, an island in the West Indies, where 
there is a great traffic for slaves. 
Henry, Traffic for slaves, papa ? 
Mi\ Bill, I will explain it to you. In 
Africa — ^}^ou remember, I suppose, which 
way that quarter of the world lies ? 
lienry^. Oh, yes; towards the South. 
Mr, Bill. In Africa, which is the country 
of the negroes, men, in ignorance and 
stupidity, do not seem to differ nuich from 
the brutes Their chiefs or kings, who 
are as savage as themselves, treat them 
accordingly. If any Europeans arrive on 
their coasts, wliole crowds of blacks are 
oifered to them for sale, as we sell cattle 
here in tlie market. Even fathers bring 
their children and exchange them for tri- 
fles

fles. , Tl;iq§..the Europeans every year pur- 
chase ag-r4;at uuniber of negroes, and carry 
ihepi to,t|ie West Indies, wi.ere they are 
forced to work at the liard^st labour, and 
are treated in every resj>ect with a great 
deal of severity. The l')t of such a alate 
(for so these.unfortunate people are called 
by their, purchasers) is truly wretched, 
nor can we wonder that many have even 
preferred death to \U 

Rich. It is not well done to use human 
beings in that manner. 

Mr, Bill, Certainly it is very unjust ; 
and we have hopes that in time this iniqui- 
tous traffic of slaves will be al)olished. 

Robinson found also, among the papers, 
an account from which he gathered that the 
ship was bound for Barbadoes, and had a 
hundred slaves aboard. Having communi- 
cated this circumstance to Friday, headded, 
** Who knows if these poor wretches are,

which occasioned the ship to strike ? Who

selves by their t)Oats, and landed on some 
island, where, their tyrants having no lon- 
ger-any power over them, they now live 
after their fashion, happy and contented:" 
Friday agreed that this conjecture was 
not wholly improbable. ** Well, then, 
my friend," replied Robinson with some 
warmth, '' coidd you now repeat the ques- 
tion that you lately asked me ?" 

Frid. What question ? 

Rob, You asked me, of what use could 
the storm be that carried away our canoe ? 

Friday looked down quite ashamed and 
confounded. 

** Oh! Friday," said Robinson, animated 
with pious zeal, ^* acknowledge here the 
hand of an all-powerful and all-wise God, 
which has appeared sensibly in this aftair. 
Consider what the storm has given us, in 
return for the little it has taken away, 
Gastyour eyeson all these different articles; 
they are such as render life commodious 
and happy. Whence should we have had 
them were it not for the storm? It is, in- 
deed. 



186 THE N£W 

deed, an unpleasant thing* to owe one's 
liappiness to the misfortunes of another ; 
yet the greatest number of those who were 
in the ship are now, perhaps, better off 
than before she struck. As this supposi- 
tion is nqt wholly voidof probabihty, what 
fliink you now of the Power which governs 
the world?" 

" I think," answered Friday, ^* the wis** 
dom and goodness of that Power are inex- 
pressible, and I was a senseless idiot in say- 
ing what 1 did." At the same time, he 
lifted up his hands and eyes towards Hea- 
ven, and implored pardon for the fault which 
he had committed through stupidity. 

Robinson took as much care of the pa- 
pers wliich he had been looking over, as of 
the diamonds and gold-dust, that, if ever 
he returned to Europe, he might, by means 
of them, discover the persons to whom he 
should restore the treasure that he bad 
saved out of the ship. 

For six days successively they made two 
or three trips a day to the wreck, and 

brought 



ROBINSOX CRUSOE. 18/ 

broiigiit to land every thing that they could 
possibly convey away. A thousand little 
matters which we would searely think it 
worth while to pick up, because we have 
never felt liow disaoreeable the loss of 
them is, were of infinite value to them, and, 
therefore, they did not neglect to' take 
them away. One part of the cargo con- 
sisted of elephants teeth ; those they did 
not toudi, because they could make no use 
of them. They also left behind seve- 
ral hogsheads of coffee; as Robinson was 
determined not to fall again into the habit 
of using pernicious superfluities though 
ever so agreeable : but they tore up and 
carried away as many of the ship's planks 
as they could, because they seemed likely 
to be useful, and, consequently, valuable. 
They took away even the remaining five 
pieces of cannon, together with all the iron 
thatthey either found loose or could loosen 
from the ship's works. 

After they' had made eighteen trips, all 
with good success, they observed, as they 
were on board the nineteenth time, that a 



188 THE NEW 

Storm was rising very fast. They made* 
haste, therefore, to load the raft and push 
off, hoping to gain tlie shore by rowing be- 
fore the storm should gat her strength. But 
in vain; they were scarce halfway towards 
the shore when a violent gale of wind, ac- 
companied with thunder, lightning and 
rain, swelled and agitated the sea in such 
a manner, that the waves rolling over the 
raft, carried off all the goods that were 
upon it. As to themselves, they held pret- 
ty close for some time to the mast, so that 
the waves could not wash them away, though 
at times they went clean over their heads, 

At length the slightness of the raft be- 
gan to give way to the fury of the waves. 
The cordage and osier bindings, which 
held the pieces of it together, being loos* 
ened, all the beams of which it consisted 
quickly came asunder. 

Harriet, Heavens ! what will become of 
poor Robinson ? 

The Children. Softly ! have patience ! 

Mr, Bill. fViday sought to save himself 



by swimming, afid Rtifcihson siezed a piece 
of wood, with whicK he was sometimes 
plunged into thedeej^- and soaietimes rode 
upon the ridge of the waves. J3ut, being 
longer under water than above, he had lost 
his breath, and could neither see nor hear. 
His strength now forsook him, and he was 
almost insensible; he utters a weak cry^ and 
sinksdown, oppressed by a huge wave, which 
carries away the beam that supported him. 

Happily his faithfiil Friday was not far 
from him, though he might have saved him- 
self and gained the shore sooner if he had 
chosen to do so. When he saw him sink, 
he, without hesitating a moment^ dived 
down, seized him with his left hand, and by 
means of his right rose with him again to 
the surface of the water. He then exerted 
himself with so much success, that in a few 
minutes he reached the shore with his mas- 
ter's body. 

The Children. Ah i his body ! 

Mr. Bill. You all seem to be alarmed. I 
use the word body because Robinson shew- 
ed no signs of life. 



igO THE NEW 

FrHay, who was distracted at liis mas- 
ter's pi esent condition, carried him a little 
farther up on the beach, hung over him, 
called him with a loud voice, shook him, 
rubbed him, and joined his lips to his 
mouth to communicate breath to him if 
possible. At length he had the inexpres- 
sible satisfaction to perceive signs of life 
in him: he, therefore, continued his exer- 
tions, and Robinson quickly recovered the 
use of his faculties. 

Opening his eyes, he asked in a weak 
and trembling voice, ^^ Where am I?" '*Iii 
my arms, my dear master!" answered Fri- 
day with tears in his eyes. An affecting 
scene now took place between them. Ro- 
binson thanked Friday a thousand times, 
and called him his saviour: Friday for his 
part, through joy at seeing hirn restored to 
himself, was almost ready to. run wild. 

My dear children, we cannot finish the 
account of that day^'s adventures with any 
circumstance more interesting than this. 
Enough, therefore, for the present time.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. l^l 



TWENTY-SIXTH EVENING. 



Mr. bill. Well, my clear children, 
our friend Robinson is restored to life once 
more. A good night's sleep in his tent, 
upon a bed that he had saved from the 
wreck, recovered him so M^ell, that he was 
up at day-break; he felt himself possessed 
of his usual strength, and returned thanks 
to God for having preserved both his life 
and health. The stornx had continued the 
whole night, and be waited, with impa- 
tience, until it was broad day-light, to see 
what was become of the ship. 

The sun was now above the horizon, 
and Robinson saw, to his grief, that the 
ship had disappeared. Planks and tim- 
bers, scattered here and there upon the 
beach, were sufficient tokens that the storm 
had dashed it to pieces. This being the 

case, 



\^'Ji THE NEW 

case, he- found some reason to applaud his 
own. foresight in saving every part of the 
cargo that he could. Happy the man 
whose pvLidence and caution always re- 
gulate his conduct, and who, in all the 
accidents which deprive him of any advan- 
tage, can say to himself, with truth, a» Ro- 
binson could upon this occasion, that it 
was not his fault ! How much this inward 
satisfaction will lighten the misfortunes, 
which, without it, would be accompanied 
with the greatest vexation I 

Robinson and Friday were particularly 
careful to gather all the remains of the 
wreck together on one spot of the beach. 
They foresaw that every plank and every 
splinter might be of use another time. 
When they had finished every thing that 
concerned the wreck, they formed a regular 
plan of the employments which were to 
take place next. 

The object was, at present, to convey all 
these goods to their dwelling-place; but 
they thought it dangerous, while they car- 
ried 



vied one parcel, to be at so great a distance 
from the rest. 'Robinson settled it, there- 
fore, that they should carry the goods and 
stand guard alternately, the one in the 
morning, the other in the afternoon. He 
loaded the carriage guns, ranged th^m be- 
side each other, like a battery, and p(3inted 
them towards the sea. Tiiey kindled a 
fire, which he who stood centinel was to 
take care to keep up; and they placed a 
iiiatch beside the guns, that they might be 
ready to fire when ever the case required it. 

Robinson made the first journey to carry 
the goods home. In order to spare his best 
cloaths, he had drest himself like a sailor; 
and instead of the weapons that he formerly 
wore, he had now a cutlass by his side, and 
two loaded pistols in his girdle. He began 
by loading his wheel- barrow with some 
casks of gunpowderandother articles which 
>vere most in danger from the rain. The 
water-spaniel, which had never quitted 
him, was by no means a useless companion 
on this journey. Robinson harnessed him 

Vol. II. K t« 



1^4 THE ^EW 

to the wheel -barrow, and the dog was of 
considerable service to him in conveying 
the burthen forward. As these spaniels are 
very docile, and capable of being taught 
many things, this dog was soon trained to 
his new employment, and acquitted him- 
self in it as well as any beast accustomed 
to the draught. He carried also a parcel in 
his mouth, which he had been taught to 
do bj those to whom he formerly belonged. 

At his return, Robinson brought all his 
Hamas, ready harnessed for carrying bur- 
thens, in order to use them for that purpose. 
As there were seven of them, and each of 
them was able to carry one hundred and 
fifty pounds weight, you may easily calcu- 
late the weight of goods which they, all to- 
gether, conveyed home every journey. 

So many articless could not all be stowed 
m Robinson's cellar. He hastened, there- 
fore, to pitch another lar^e tent in the en- 
closed ground before his cave. This was 
meant as a store-tent for the present, until 
other means should be contrived for secur- 



«r 




ROBINSON CRUSOE, 195 

ing the things. In eight days the \vholo 
was carried home, except a number of 
boards and timbers which they sheltered 
as well as they could with thickets and 
brush- wood. 

Harriet, But, papa, you have not told 
us any thing more about the goat. 

Mr. Bill, Ah! very true; I had nearly 
forgot her. Well, the goat, as you may 
suppose, was brought home also, and put. 
into a little park along with th|e tame lamas, 
and she agreed very well with them. 

What agreeable employments have Ro- 
binson and Friday now before them ! They 
scarce know where to begin. However, 
Robinson, who had contracted a taste for 
regularity, as well as the habit of it, quickly 
distinguished the more necessary labours 
from those which were less so, and did not 
hesitate in giving the preference to the for- 
mer. The most important of all was the 
building of ashed, or storehouse, to shelter 
the goods, which could not be put into the 
cellar, more securely than they were under 
Ka the 



1^5 THE ^EV/ 

the tent. Here it was necessary to do the 
business of a house-carpenter, to which 
they had neither of them served an appren- 
ticeship. 

But what could he difficult to the indus- 
trious and persevering Robinson, now that 
he Mas provided Avith all sorts of tools? 
The most troublesome pieces of work, and 
those in which he had the least experience, 
were no more than a play to him who had 
happily succeeded in so many others with-' 
out assistance or proper tools. The cut- 
ting down and hewing out of the trees, the 
squaring of the beams and rafters, the join- 
ing and fitting of them, building of brick 
walls, making of a double roof, one of 
boards, and the other of the leaves of the 
cocoa-nut tree — were all executed with 
surprising dispatch. 

The little building, when fmished, was 
not much unlike one of our country cot- 
tages. Robinson had taken care to bring 
away with him the ship's cabin windows; 
they served to give light to the building, 

without 



S0BIN5ON CRUSOK. 137 

without the inconveniency of holes that 
would let in the wind. The glass was :an 
object of particular ad iin ration to Friday ; 
he had never seen any before, and he 
learnt, by experience, the commodious 
purposes that it serves. 

When all was put under cover and in 
proper order, Robinson thought of contriv- 
ing for himself a convenient way of enter- 
ing his fortress without weakening it. The 
most secure method for the purpose was by 
means of^ common gate and a drawbridge; 
Being provided with every necessary, for 
this undertaking, as nails, chains, hinges, 
locks, and iron work of all sorts, he imme- 
diately began upon it. They first made the 
gate and the drawbridge; and, afterwards, 
they made an opening in the terrace and 
palisade sufficient for the width of the 
gate, which they next reared up in its 
place; then they laid down the bridge in 
such a manner, that, when raised, it might 
lie against the gate, and cover it. Lastly, 
they loaded the guns, and placed them upon 
K 3 the 



l^ THK NEW 

the terrace, in such positions, that two of 
them should defend the fight flank, two 
the left, and twt) the front of their fortifi- 
cation: so tliat henceforward they niigiit 
be quite at their ease as to the attacks of 
the savages, and had, besides, the advan- 
tage of an easy and convenient way for 
going in and out. 

When harvest lime was come, Robinson 
made use of an old hanger, instead of a 
sickle, to cut down his maize, and his wood- 
en spade served him for digging his pota- 
toes. How easily was the work performed 
with such instruments ! It would have been 
a pleasure to see them gather their harvest, 
and still more to assist them. 

Henry. Oh ! I wish I had been there! 
Ho'vv 1 would have worked I 

Edtv, Nay, you have no occasion to go 
»o for as Robinson Crusoe's island for work. 
Papa will find you plenty, if you are fond 
of it. There is wood to be sawed, to 
be split, and to be carried; there are plats 
in the garden to be dug up; there is weed- 

inir 



ROBINSOX CRUSOE. IQ^ 

ing and watering of the fiotrers; and, in 
short, toil will always find enough to do. 

Mt\ Bill. Why do I set you to work at 
these different employments? 

Bich, To accustom us nererto be idle, 
to strengthen our bodies, and preserve ws 
in good health. 

Geo, For my part, I like it, and you shal! 
always find me, papa, as diligent and in*^ 
dustrious as Robinson himself. 

3ft\ Bill. Well, we shall see that. We 
are very sensible that Robinson was the 
better for it, and every one of us also ex- 
periences more and more the happy effects 
of an active way of life. 

When the harvest was gathered, Robin- 
son made two flails. Friday soon learned^ 
the use of them, and in one day th«^ 
thrashed all their maize. It filled two sacks, 
which might contain about six bushels. 
They had a stock of biscuits which would 
last some months; but as it must, of 
course, lessen everyday, Robinson resolved 
to supply its place occasionly with bread, 
which he intended to make himseif. 



£00 Tin-: new 

He had brought a hand-mill From tlie 
ship, and wanted nothing but a sieve to 
boult tlie flour, and an oven for baking the 
bread. lie found expedients for botli. 
Some fine muslin, of which there was a 
wiiole j)iec€ amongst the goods saved from 
the ship, served him to make the bottom 
of his sieve; and the building of the oven 
gave him very little trouble; so that the 
whole was finished before the rainy season 
came on. 

He made, by way of trial, two sorts of 
bread, one of rye flour, and the other of 
maize. The rye brciKl was by far the bet- 
ter tasted of the two, which determined 
Ilobinson to give it the preference. He 
proposed to sow the greatest part of his 
land with rye, instead of maize, «that he 
might always have a stock of grain suffi- 
cient to supply them with bread; nor did 
this seem an undertaking beyond his power 
to accomplish, assisted as he was by his 
man Friday, since in this island they might 
liave two crops in the course of the year. 

'J here was one article that would have 



R EI N S ON' C PuV S E . G 01 

beeii~ exceeding; lisefut to them,* but, iiii- 
fortiinately, they coiild find nothing of ihc: 
sort amongst tlie goods in the ship; and 
that was an iron spade. It is true, Friday 
had made one of hard wood that might 
serve upon occasion, but still they fourtd 
room to wish for a better; for.it is certain, 
tliat an iron spade is, after all, more handy- 
and effective for breaking up the ground; 
than a wooden one can possibly be, Rt:)brri^' 
son, therefore, wh6 determined, for the fu- 
ture, to make agriculture his- principal em^ 
ployment, as being, of all sorts of labour, 
the most agreeable and most useful, con- 
ceived the design of fixing up a forge to 
make spades himself, and, possibly^ other 
instruments besides. 

This design was not so extravagant as 
perhaps you may think it; for every thing 
necessary for a forge wag to be found in his 
storehouser There was a small anvil, se-* 
veral pair of pincers, a pretty large pair of 
bellov/s, and such a stock of iron, both c 
wrought and in bars, as would probably be 
K 5 sufficient . 



^Ol THE NEW 

sufficient to keep him in M'ork all his life- 
time. This plan was, therefore, immedi- 
ately put in execution. 

By means of a large boarded roof, which 
they put over the kitchen, it was so ex- 
tended that they were able to fix up a forge 
in it, and to work at it even during the 
rainy season. Part of this season, therefore, 
they spent in working smith's work; and if 
they succeeded upon the whole, it was not 
without some disappointments and unsuc- 
cessful trials. When the spades were finish- 
ed, Robinson had a mind to go a litte far- 
ther, and to try his abilities at making a 
plough; and in this also, to his inexpressi- 
ble joy, he perfectly succeeded. 

This plough was, you may suppose, very 
different from ours. It consisted of a single 
tranch of a tree; one end of which, bend- 
ing down, rested on the ground, and was 
furnished with a sock, and also a handle, by 
means of which the person who ploughed 
might guide it at pleasure; at the other 
end they were to harness their oxen, or 

horses; 



ROBINSON^ CRUSOE.

liorscs; but as they had none, they were 
obliged themselves to supply their places. 
In a word, this plough was exactly like that 
in use among the autient Greeks, at their 
first undertaking the practice of agrieuU 
ture, I can ffive vou a sketch of it here. 




Henry. Really, it is a very curious 
plough. 

Geo, Had it no wheek? 

Mr. Bill, No: you see it had not. All 
instnsments were at first as simple in their 
make as this plough. By degrees nieii; 
made additions fjr greater convenience: 
so by altering and improving they increased 
the utility and commodiousness of the tools 
necessary for their diiferent labours. 

In the mean time, Robinson had every 
reason to be proud of this invention; it was 



K6 



wholly;, 



:()i THE NEW 

wholly his own, for he had never seen a 
plan of it. By all that we can learn from 
Instory, many ages of the world elapsed 
before men arrived at the invention even 
of so simple a machine as this plough ; and 
the inventors of it were looked npon by 
posterity as men of such exalted wisdom, 
that^ after their death, they were paid di- 
vine honours. Richard, you remember 
the name of him to whom the Egyptians 
attribute the invention of the plough. 

Rich. Yes ; it was Osiris, whom, for that 
reason, they afterwards worshipped as a 
god. 

Mr. Bill. The Phoenicians ascribed this 
useful invention to one Dagon, whom they 
also regarded as a being of superior order, 
and called the Son of Heaven. 

Eckt\. But Gould not Robinson Tnake the 
lamas draw the plough? 

Mr\ Bill. At first he doubted whether 
they were fit for this work, as they seemed 
rather beasts of burthen than of draught; 
however, he determined to make a trial of 
them, and the success of it exceeded hh 



ROBINSOX CRUSOE. 205 

hopes. They became gradually accustom- 
ed to the work, which, at length, they per- 
formed in every respect as perfectly as if 
Robinson and Friday had been brought up 
ploughmen, and the lamas had been trained 
like our beasts of draught. 

To sow their field according to all the 
rules of art, there wanted but one instru- 
ment, which they could scarcely do with- 
out, and which they had not found in the 
ship. 

Henry. I can guess what that was. 

Mr\ Bill. What do you think? 

Htnri). A harrow. 

Mi\ Bill. You are riglit. Without it 
tillage would be imperfect. By means of 
it we break the clods, throw the grains of 
corn into the furrows, and cover them, 
without which they would never spring up, 
but be devoured b}'^ the birds. 

In the first place, Robinson made as many 
iron teeth as he thought would be neces- 
sary for the harrow. After some unsuccess- 
ful attempts, he at length succeeded in 

making 



206 THE XEW 

making the wooden frame in which these 
iron teeth were to be Jfixed. Lastly, lie 
made as many holes in the frame as it was 
to contain teeth, and when he had driven 
them in, and clinched them, the harrow 
"was finished. 

The rainy season being over, he sowed 
two bushels of rye, one of barley, and half 
a bushel of pease ; and, at the end of five 
months, he had the satisfaction to gather 
a crop of twelve times as much seed as he 
had sown, namely, twenty-four bushels of 
rye, twelve of barley, and six of pease: a 
stock more than sufiicient to last them six 
months. But, like a prudent oeconomist, 
he was willing to have a superabundance 
of every thing, because there might come 
on a season of scarcity; besides, hail or 
other accidents might destroy his crops. 
He resolved, therefore, to have a barn, 
which, being filled every half year, might 
always contain a sufficient stock, in case 
a crop should happen to fail. 

With this intention, when the whether 

was 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 20/ 

was settled fair, they unroofed the store- 
house, in order to add another story to it, 
which might serve as a granary. The huild- 
ing of this required more skill and lahour 
than that of the ground floor; but their 
indefatigable perseverance triumphed over 
all difficulties, and the work was soon hap- 
pily completed. 

During these transactions, the goat yean- 
ed two young ones ; so that the species 
might now be multiplied and kept up on 
the island. The spaniel served as a guard 
by night, and Poll, the parrot, amused them 
at table, and pretty often also when they 
were at work. On the other hand, the la- 
mas were become more valuable to them 
than ever; as, besides affording milk, but- 
ter, and cheese, they assisted in tilling the 
ground. In order, therefore, to be per 
fectly happy, Robinson wanted nothing 
now but — guess. 

Rich. To be with his father and mother. 

Mr. Bill. And to have some more com- 
panions. Being only two upon the island, 

they 



208 THE NEW 

they must expect, sooner or later, one of 
them to die before the other, who would 
then remain a poor liermit, separated from 
all the rest of mankind. Yet Robinson 
looked upon it as a blameable weakness to 
make one's life miserable by the dread of 
evils that are possible, but still concealed in 
futurity. *' The same power," thought he,: 
'' who has hitherto provided for me in all 
things with such unexampled bounty, will 
still continue to exert it in my favour." 
Thus his life passed in tranquillity and con- 
tent. He enjoyed inwardly peace of mind ; 
and, without, every thing ])romised him the 
most perfect security. Happy state! May 
God grant you all to enjoy the samel 

*' Amen," said Mrs. Billingsley.; and th^ 
company separated.

TWENTY-SEVENTH EVENING. 



Mr. bill. Well, my dear children, I 
have a great muiiber of things to relate to 
you this evening. 

The Children. Oh ! so much the better! 
that is charming 1 . 

Mr. Bill. Provided only that I find my-

The Children. Oh ! dear papa, we shall 
take care not to interrupt you, so that you 
will certainly be able to get through it. 

Mr. Bill Well, I shall try; but prepare 
yourselves for a fresh scene of horror, the 
event of which cannot be foreseen — :By 
your motions I can nearly perceive what 
your conjectures are; the sequel will shew 
whether they are just. 

If I were to go on now enumerating to 
you all that Robinson performed everyday 
by the help of the tools witli which he was 

provided, 



210 THE NEW 

provided, the recital would not amuse 3'ou 
very much. 

Jiich. It might be agreeable enough; 
but we can easily imagine all that. 

Mr, BUI. I shall only inform you, that 
they successively attempted many different 
aits, and imitated most sorts of tradesmen 
— the baker, the blacksmith, the taylor, the 
shoemaker, the carpenter, thejoiner, the 
wheelwright, the potter, the gardener, the 
butcher, the fisherman, and several others; 
they imitated them, I say, with so much 
success, that the}'' were soon able to make 
up a hundred things, for which we indolent 
Europeans require as many different work- 
men. Their strength increased in propor- 
tion as they exerted it, and their minds, 
being in a state of constant activity, and 
always in search of some useful object, were 
improved everyday more and more. May 
not this be regarded as a proof that we were 
created for the same activit}^ since health, 
virtue, and happiness, are the necessary 
consequences of it ? 

Six 



ftOBlN50N CRUSOE. 211 

Six months passed away in these agree- 
able employments, during all which time 
Friday durst not revive the scheme of tak- 
ing a voyage to his own country; but fre- 
quently, after finishing his task of work, 
ht would go up the hill from whence he 
could see his native island, and there, bu- 
rred in profound though tfuln ess, he lament--^ 
ed the misfortune of being separated from 
his father, perhaps for ever. Robinson, for 
his paft, had avoided speaking on the sub- 
ject, because it was not in his power to 
comply with his friend's wish while the ne- 
cessary arrangements, which their new way 
of living required, were still unfinished. 

At present the most indispensable parts 
of the business were completed, and Robin- 
son was the first to propose the building of 
another boat, to go and seek Friday's fa- 
ther. At this proposal the young man*s 
joy was as great as formerly on the same 
occasion, and his thankfulness to Robinson 
appeared in the same manner. The work 
was begun the very next day, and, with 

the 



212 ■ THE NEW 

the help of good hatchets, was finislied, 
as you may easily imagine, much better 
and much sooner than the first time. 

One morning that Robinson was engaged 
in the ordinary cares of liis habitation, he 
sent Friday to the sea-side for some turtle, 
which was uow become a rarity to them» 
•After a short absence, he came back run- 
ning at full speed. Out of breath with 
running and with fright together, he could 
but just stammer out these words, ** Here 
they are! here they are!'* 

Robinson, in a fright, asked him hastily 
whom he meant. *' Oh I master ! master !'* 
answered Friday, '^one, two, three — -six ca- 
noes 1" In his flurry he could scarcely bring 
out the number six. 

Robinson ran hastily up to the top of thei 
hillock, and saw, not without shuddering, 
that Friday had counted right. He perceiv- 
ed six canoes full of savages, just ready to 
land. Coming down immediately, he bid 
Friday be of good courage, who stood 
trembling all the while ; and he asked him, 

whether, 



as 




ROBINSONS" CRUSOE. 213 

whether, if they should come to an engage- 
ment with the enemy, he would stand by 
him faithfully, to the best of his power. 

^' Yes," answered he, *^ to the last drop 
of my blood ;'* for, having had time to re- 
cover himself, he felt his courage mount 
by degrees to its usual pitch. *' Well,'' 
said Robinson, ^Met us endeavour to pre- 
vent these monsters from executing their 
horrible designs. I will explain my inten- 
tion to you as we go along ; this is not the 
time to talk — we must act." 

With these words, he wheeled down one 
of the carriage guns, took six muskets, two 
brace of pistols, and two hangers. Each of 
them put a brace of pistols in his girdle, a 
hanger by his side, and three muskets on his 
shoulder, and when they had taken a suffi- 
cient quantity of powder and ball, they har- 
nessed themselves to the gun, aud with a 
iirm countenance took the field under all 
that formidable and warlike apparatus. 

Having passed the drawbridge, they halt- 
ed. Friday went back into the fort to raise 

the 



214 THE NEW 

the bridge and shut the gate, and then, bj 
means of the ladder of ropes, which always 
hung to the rock, he came out again, and 
joined his general. Robinson thought this 
precaution necessary, that, in case their 
undertaking should not succeed, the ene- 
my might not be able to get possession of 
his fortress. 

Here Robinson explained to Friday the 
plan that he had formed. " We will go 
round the hillock," said he, " and walk 
through the thickest part of the wood, tha^ 
we may not be perceived by the enemy; 
and, then, crossing amongst the thickets, 
M^hich extend almost to the sea side, we 
shall approach the savages \vithout being 
perceived by them. When within reach 
of them, we will fire the great gun, and 
the ball passing over their heads, no doubt, 
will terrify the barbarians, make them 
abandon their prey, and take to flight in 
their canoes.'* 

Friday thought the plan not impracti* 
cable. ** Thus," continued Robinson, "we 
shall have the satisfaction of saving the un- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 215 

fortunate wretcbei whom they intend to 
devour, without shedding a drop of blood. 
But if, contrary to our expectations, they 
should be encouraged by their numbers, and 
not take to flight, then, my dear Friday, we 
must shew that we are men, by bravely fa- 
cing the danger to which we shall expose 
ourselves from the most laudable intentions. 
He, from whom nothing is hid, sees what 
induces us to endanger our lives; he will 
preserve them if it be for our advantage : 
therefore, his will be done." 

And so saying, he gave his hand to his 
companion, and they mutually promised 
to assist each other to the last drop of their 
blood. 

Having arrived without noise almost at 
the last of the thickets, they there made a 
halt. Robinson, in a low voice, desired 
Friday to steal with all posible circumspec- 
tion behind a large tree which he shewed 
him, and then to come back and inform 
him whether he could discover the enemy 
from that spot. He brought word back 

that 



21(5 THT. NEW 

that they M'crc easily to be seen sitting 
round a large fire, and picking tlie bones 
of one prisoner whom they had already dis- 
patclied; that, not far from them, he sav/ 
another lying on the gronnd, and tied hand 
and foot, who seemed to be a white man, 
and had the appearance of a beard; and 
that, in all probability, he was going soon 
to share the same fate. 

Robinson was startled at this report, es- 
pecially when he heard mention of a white 
man. Having a prospect glass about him, 
which he had found aboard the ship, he 
went to the tree himself, and from thence, 
by the help of this instrument, could dis- 
cover thatFriday's accoun was piri- cctly 
true. He saw about fifty savages sitting 
round a fire, and could clearly distinguish 
the prisoner to be an European. 

He could scarcely contain himself: his 
heart throbbed, his blood boiled. If he 
were to yield to the fury of his first passion, 
and fall upon these barbarians at once, it 
Avould be the way to shed much blood, 

But, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 217 

But, as the blind instinct of passion should 
never get the better of reason, he restrains 
his transports in order to avoid that un- 
pleasing necessity. 

As there was a spot farther on equally 
sheltered with thickets, he went behind a 
bush pretty near tlie savages, and which 
had an opening in the middle of it large 
enough to see through, though not to be 
remarked at a distance ; there he points his 
cannon in such a manner that the ball 
would pass over the heads of the savages 
high enough not to hurt them. Then he 
told Friday in a low, voice, to imitate 
exactly what he should see him do. 

He lays down two of his muskets on the 
ground, and holds the third in his hand; 
Friday does the same: he then applies a 
lighted match to the touch-hole of the can- 
non, and fires it off. 

At the noise of the report, the savages 
fell backwards on the grass as if they had 
been all shot at once. Robinson and Fri- 
day, on their side, attentive to what passed, 

Vol. IL L aed 



tlS THE NEW 

and uncertain wliat might be the event, 
prepared for engaging if that should hap- 
pen to be necessary. In less than a minute 
the savages rise off the ground, recovering 
from their astonishment ; the most fearful 
run to their canoes, but the boldest take up 
their arms. 

They had been frightened merely by the 
noise of the cannon; unfortunately, they 
did not p erceive the fire, nor hear the 
whistling of the ball. The fright was, 
therefore, not near so great as had been 
expected. After looking round on every 
side without discovering any thing that 
could terrify them again, they gathered 
courage, and those who were running away 
presently returned. They all set up a 
dreadful yell, and began their war dance, 
shaking their weapons with furious looks 
and gestures. 

Robinson was undetermined whatto do, 
but observing with surprise, that, when the 
dance was ended, the whole company of the 
savages not only took their places again, 
but sent two of their number to seize the 



aOBINSON CRUSOE. 219 

unfortunate European, he could not con- 
tain himself any longer. He looked at Fri- 
day, and says to him, in a low voice, *' You 
take the right, I the left, and Heaven be 
our defence!" So saying, he presents and 
fires; Friday does the same. 

The man took much better aim than the 
master; for on the enemy's left there fel[ 
five, and on the right only three : of these 
eight three were killed, the rest wounded. 
The consternation with whicli tUn^e who 
were not hurt took to fligiit, cannot be de- 
scribed. Some ran one way, sonic another, 
all of them yelling in the most hideous 
manner. Robinson was -going to sally out 
from behind the bushes, sword in hand, in 
order to take advantage of their rout, and 
deliver the untbrtunate European, who lay 
bound haml and foot; but he saw, with 
astonishment, a party of the runaways rallv 
all of a sudden, and stand upon their de- 
fence. He made haste to take up a second 
musket, and Friday doing the same, they 
botli fired at oac^. 

L£ At 



220 THE NEW 

At this discharge there fell onlv two of 
the enemy; but several of them being 
wounded, some more, some less dangerously, 
began to runaway, howling dreadfully: 
presently, three of them fell down, but 
still with some remains of life. 

Robinson, when he laid down the gun 
that he had just fired, to take up the third, 
which was still loaded, said to Friday in a 
loud voice, *' Now let us shew ourselves:" 
at the same instant they both start from 
their concealment, and appear before the 
savages. Robinson flies to the unfortunate 
prisoner, to shew him that relief was at 
hand; but as he approaches him, perceives 
that some of the savages, who before were 
running away, now that they discovered 
their enemy, stopped short, and rallied to 
prepare for combat. He noticed this to 
Friday, who perfectly understood his mas- 
ter's meaning, advanced a little way, fired, 
and saw one of the Indians fall. 

In the mean time, Robinson, with his 
knife, cut the bulrushes with which the 

prisoner's 



BOBINSON CRUSOE. 221 

prisoner's hands and feet were tied, and ask- 
ing him in English and Latin, who he was, 
the man answered in Latin, Christianus, 
Hispanus ; that is, a Christian and a Spa 
niard. His excessive weakness hindered 
him from saying any more. Fortunately, 
Robinson had taken care to provide a bot- 
tle of wine, in case of being wounded. He 
gave the Spaniard a little, which revived 
him exceedingly, so that he soon began to 
recover his strength. Robinson then fur- 
nished him with a hanger and a pistol, that 
he might help them to complete the defeat 
of the savages, and, mean time, Friday was 
ordered to bring all the muskets, that they 
might be loaded afresh. 

The moment the Spaniard was armed 
with a hanger and pistol, he fell furiously 
upon his enemies, and dispatched two of 
ihem in the twinkling of an eye. Friday, 
with the sixth musket, which had not been 
fired yet, advanced to support him, while 
Robinson was hastening to load the other 
five. The two champions found some re-^ 
L 3 sistance

distance at first, and were soon separated; 
ioY the Spaniard came to close engagement 
with a very stout Indian, and Friday, on 
the other hand, after firing his last musket, 
pursued, sword in hand, a wliole party of 
runaways, some of whom fell beneatli his 
arm, others jumped into the sea to swim 
to their canoes, and the rest fled and hid 
themselves amongst the bushes. 

iiut the Spaniard was now hard put to it. 
He had, it is true, at first, notwithstanding 
his weakness, attacked the Indian with great 
impetousity, and given him two wounds in 
tiie head with his hanger: but this so en- 
raged the savage, that with his lieavy stone 
falcliion he was near cutting the Spaniard 
(iown, who found it as much as he could do 
to j)arry oft' his blows: nor, indeed, could 
lie at lengiii prevent the furious Indian 
from seizing him by the middle, throwing 
him to the ground, and twisting the hanger 
out of his hand; but in the very moment 
that he was going to cut off his head, Ro- 
binson perceived the Spaniard's danger, 

fired 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 223 

firefl at the savage, and killed him on the 
spot. 

Scarce was the Spaniard raised from the 
ground before he seized a loaded musket, 
and went with Friday in pursuit of the sa- 
vages who had fled into the coppice. As 
they were few in number, and for the most 
part wounded, Robinson thought it best to 
remain in tlie field of battle, and observe 
the motions of those who had escaped to 
their canoes. His two friends were not 
long before they joined him again, with 
the assurance that there were no more of 
the enemy in the wood. 

They were both about to enter one of 
the canoes which the savages had left, and 
to pursue those who were rowing off to 
sea; but Robinson stopped them. *' JMy 
friends," said he,'^' it is enough; we have, 
perhaps, shed more blood than we ought. 
Let us suffer those to live who have no 
longer the intention or the power to hurt 
us." 

J^ But if we sutler them to escape," re- 
L 4 plied 



S24 THt NhW 

plied Friday, '* they will, perhaps, return 
and attack us in greater numbers." 

" Well," answered Robinson, clapping 
him on the shoulder in a friendly manner, 
and pointing to the Spaniard, '* is not our 
army also stronger now by one- third than 
it was in the morning? Thus reinforced, 
we shall be able at any time to cope with 
an army of these miserable enemies, espe- 
cially if we stay for them behind our en- 
trencliincnts." 

Harriet. That was v/ell done of Robin- 
son, to spare the remainder of the savages. 

Mr. Bill It v/as certainly acting with 
prudence, and humanity. It would have 
been too cruel to kill, without necessity, a 
single one of these unfortunate wretches, 
v/ho had not the least suspicion that there 
was any harm in wliat they were doing, and 
who, on the contrary, embraced, as the 
clearest truth, that deplorable error which 
taught them that to kill and eat a great 
number of their enemies was a very meri- 
torious action. 

Edw. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 22^ 

Edw, Yet, I think, they ought to have 
known that it was not right to do so. 

Mr, Bill. My dear friend, how could 
they have known it? 

Edxv. Hey-day! Why any little child 
knows that it is not right to kill a man 
and then eat liim. 

Mr, Bill, But how does the little child 
know this? Is it not by being early so in- 
structed ? 

Edw. Yes, certainly. 

Mr. Bill, And if he had never been in- 
tructed on the subject, if his father, his 
mother, and all those whom he ought to 
love and respect, had always told him. that 
it is a very laudable action to kill one's 
enemy and eat his body? 

Edw, Nay, ivhy— to be sure — then— 

Mr. Bill, Why, then, a child would never 
suspect t\\€, contrary. Me would rather 
partake, as soon as he was of age, in the 
killing and the feasting. This was the case 
with those poor savages. Let us thank God 
that we were not born amongst them, but 
L 5 had

had civilized parents, who early instructed 
us in tile difference hetween good and evil, 
justice and injustice. 

Our hero, tlie friend of liuman kind, 
shed tears of compassion when lie travers- 
ed the field of hattle to assist those who 
were still alive. It was all over with the 
greatest jmrt of iliein, and the rest ex 
pired in his arms while he poured wine 
upon their wounds, and endeavoured to 
recover thtm. The savages lost one and 
twenty men, and the victorious army, far 
from having lost any, had only one 
wounded; the Spaniard, when he was 
thrown down, had received a severe bruise. 
Harriet. But how came the Spaniard 

amongst the savages, papa?

TWENTY-EIGHTH EVENING. 



Harriet, Wjell, papa, now^ for the 
Spaniard; wliat brought him amongst the 
savages ? 

M)\ Bill. Have a little patience, and yon 
shall hear. Some incidents happened in the 
mean time wliicli I must first relate to you. 

Rich, Indeed! well, that rouses my 
cui'iosity. 

Mr, Bill. Robinson, having a mind to 
examine one of the two canoes which the 
savages had left behind them, went towards 
it, and, to his great astonishment, he found 
in it another unfortunate creature, tied 
hand and foot as the Spaniard had been, 
and looking more iXt^d than alive. 

Robinson made haste to cut his cords, , 
and ^vould have lifted him up, but he was 
not able cither to stand or speak. He lay 
I^ 6' groaning. 



-28 'THE NEW 

groaning, no doubt, under the apprehension 
that they were going to put him to death. 

As he was an Indian, not an European, 
Robinson called Friday, who was then busv 
in burying the dead bodies, to speak to him 
in his native tongue. Scarce bad he cast 
eyes on the prisoner before Robinson and 
tlie Spaniard saw a scene take place which 
drew from them tears of benevolent sym- 
pathy. Friday, all of a sudden, like a man 
beside liimself, flies to the prisoner, em- 
braces him, locks him in liis arms, cries, 
laughs, jumps, dances, roars, clasps his 
hands, strikes himself on the face and 
breast, cries out again, and, in short, acts 
like one that is delirious. It was some time 
before Robinson, who questioned and urged 
him repeatedly, could draw from him this 
short answer, ** It is my father!" 

It would be difficult to describe all the 
marks of filial love and affection which this 
excellent young man shewed upon this oc- 
casion. Twenty times he jumped out of the 
cano€ upon land, and from the land into 

the 



29 




EOBINSON CRUSOE. 9,^9 

the canoe again.. Some times, sitting down, 
he opened his jacket, and pressed his fa- 
ther's head to his bosom to warm it; at 
others, he rubbed the joints of his arms and 
legs, which were numbed by having been 
so tightly bound ; and now he embraced 
hini again, and covered him with kisses. 
Robinson, who had still some wine in 
his bottle, gave it to him to wash his fa- 
ther's limbs, which were grievously 
swelled. He then stepped aside to let Fri- 
day indulge his joy with more freedom. 

Returning after some time, he askerl him 
if he had made his father take any nourish- 
ment. *^ The glutton, " answered he, point- 
ing to himself, *Miad before eaten up aH." 
Robinson gave him his breakfast, which h^ 
had not touched, and Friday gave it to his 
father. Scarce had he received it when 
his son started out of the canoe in a hurry, 
and went off so quick, that before Robin- 
son had time to say. Where are you going, 
Friday was already out of sight 

He soon appeared again, but did iK)t eome 

back 



230 ' THE NEW 

back with quite sucli expedition. Wheii 
he was pretty near, they could see that he 
had a pitclier of water in one hand, and 
some victuals in the other. ■ He gave tlic 
water to his father, and the victuals to his 
master in return for the breakfast which he 
])ad received from him. The cold water 
afforded visible refreshmeiitto the old man, 
who was ready to faint with thirst. 

Robinson then turned towards the Spa- 
niard, who, exhausted with fatigue, was 
lyinty stretched upon the grass. lie made 
Friday help him also to some refreshment. 
The Spaniard, by his looks, endeavoured to 
express his gratitude. He strove to rise,, 
but was not able, being prevented by the. 
pain that he felt in the joints of his hands 
and feet, which were swelled from having 
been bound so very tightly. Friday was 
ordered to sit down beside him, to bathe 
his arms and legs with wine, and to take 
the same care of him as he had of his father. 

It was truly moving to behold this affec- 
tionate son, who, while he attended the 

Spaniard, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2 31 

Spaniard, turned his head every moment 
towards his father to see how he was. At 
one time, when the old man, in order to re- 
pose himself, lay down at full length, Fri- 
day, quite uneas3% flew to him without 
speaking a word; but when he saw that 
his father had only lain down to be more 
at his ease, he returned in a moment, and 
continued his attention to the Spaniard. 
Robinson now had a mind to try whether 
he could not, with Friday's assistance, con- 
vey the Spaniard to the canoe; but Friday^ 
who was young and strong, took that task 
upon himself alone, and carried him with 
ease upon his shoulders. When they had 
placed in the other canoe, not only the 
cannon and the muskets, but also all the 
arms of the conquered Indians, Friday 
quickly entered the first, and, though the 
wind began to freshen, and was rather 
against him, yet he made such speed, by 
dint of rowing, that Robinson, who ran un 
foot along the sea-side, could by no means 
equal the swiftness of the canoe. He was 

scarce 



o-y^ THE NEW 

scarce half way hoir.e when he saw Friday 
returning, who passed by him in his way to 
fetch the other canoe j and before Robinson 
could get up to the first, where the Spa- 
niard and Friday's father were, Friday was 
there with a second: with such remark- 
able swiftness did he row. 

Thev were now opposite their dwelling- 
place. Robinson hastened thither for some 
planks and poles, which he put together in 
the form of a litter or bier, to convey the 
disabled men to his habitation with more 
case. He and Friday carried them up, one 
after the other. What a treasure was here 
for Robinson, who longed for nothing so 
much as the happiness of enlarging his 
company! His heart beat with joy when 
he reflected, that, for the future, he need 
not apprehend being forced to lead a life 
of solitude again. His satisfaction was 
complete. -As the two invalids seemed to 
have occasion for nothing so much as rest, 
Robinson presently warmed some wine to 
bathe their bruised iimbs, while Friday 

made 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 233 

made them up a bed, on which, when ready, 
they delayed not to repose themselves. 

The two hosts then prepared a good 
supper. Friday was ordered to go to the 
park, and bring home a young lama; Ro- 
binson undertook all the rest. He could 
not help smiling frequently at the thought 
that he should now resemble a king still 
more than ever. The whole island was 
under his dominion; all his subjects were 
indebted to him for their lives, acknow- 
ledged his will as their supreme law, and 
were bound to expose themselves in his 
cause to the greatest dangers if necessary 
One circumstance was remarkable, that he 
counted in his dominions as many different 
sects of religion as he had subjects. Fri- 
day hud adopted his master's religion, 
which was the Protestant; the Spaniard 
was a Roman Catholic, and Friday's fa- 
^ ther was an idolater. 

** What is to be done in this matter?'*^ 
said Robinson to himself: *' have I not a 
right to oblige them all to embrace the be- 
lief 



234 DIE NEW 

lief which I tliink best ?" He was some 
time refiecting on this subject, because 
it was one that had never engaged his 
thoughts before. 

What answer tliink ye, my dear chil- 
dren, should sound reason have given to 
this question? Ought he to force his sub- 
jects to receive his particular religion, or 
ought he not? 

The Children, He should not constrain 
them in any respect. 

Mr, Bill. Why not? 

Rich. Because a man's behef, or way of 
thinking, is independent of all the world, 
provided he behaves himself inoffensively 
in other respects. 

Mr, Bill. But if a master sees clearly 
that his subject is in an error, may he not 
lawfully force him to renounce it? 

Rich. What would be the conseijuence? 
When a man is forced to believe, he be- 
comes neither the honester nor the wiser 
for it. 

Mr. Bill. That is true, for violence can 

never 



ROBIXfeON CRUaOE. S3S 

never convince hitn that he was in an error 
])efore; and of what use can professing be, 
when it does not proceed from conviction? 
Besides, how is a man certain that he whom 
he would force to embrace his beh'ef, is 
really in an error?' May he not be mista- 
ken himself? 

Henri/, Certainly that might be the case. 

Mr. Bill. How so? 

Henry. Because every man is liable to 
be deceived. 

Mr. Bill. Consequently, no man has a 
right to advance his opinions as incontest- 
able truths. 

In fine, my dear children, it belongs to 
God alone to be the infallible judge of our 
belief: he alone can decide on the truth or 
falsehood of our opinions : none but he can 
know perfectly whether our search after 
the truth has been earnest and sincere, or 
slight and negligent; nor is there any but 
he who can judge how far our errors are 
to be imputed to us. 

Robinson saw this matter nearly in the 

same 



QS6 THE NEW 

same light. "Far from me," said he, ** be 
the indiscreet zeal which endeavours to 
force men into its belief! Far from me be 
the blind frenzy of persecuting and tortur- 
ing fellow-creatures, merely because they 
have the misfortune to be deceived, or the 
virtue to refuse professing publicly that 
of which they are not convinced inwardly. 
In my island, at least, such injustice shall 
never find a place. I will do every thing 
in my power to enlighten my new subjects, 
but if I am not happy enough to convince 
thsni of their errors, or of the truth of my 
religion, then I shall leave the. to believe 
what they ca7t believe, and to give an ac- 
count of their faith, not to me, who am 
their equal and lia ble to error, but to God 
alone, the unerring judge of all." 

He, therefore, resolved, that all, M'ithout 
distinction, should enjoy the free exercise 
of their religion, if it should so happen 
that,notwithstanding previous instruction, 
they could not agree among themselves 
upon one single form of religious worship. 

Friday 



RoniNsaN CRUSOE. 237 

Friday being now returned, they forth- 
with proceeded to get ready the supper. 
*' Let us celebrate this day/' said Robin- 
son, *' as a double festivals on the one 
hand, we have rescued two fellow-creatures 
from the voracity of those monsters in hu- 
man shape; on the other hand, you have 
found your father." 

Friday had no occasion to be exhorted to 
rejoice; indeed, his heart had never ex- 
perienced such joy before, and he shewed 
it continually, by singing, jumping, and 
laughing, all the while that he per- 
formed v/hat he had to do with equal dili- 
gence and exactness. Cheerfulness and 
gaiety, far from being a. fault, is ever an 
amiable quality, when, instead of making 
us absent and neglectful, it dieers us in 
our labours. 

The two guests now awoke. Although 
they still felt some pain, yet they found 
themselves considerably relieved, and able, 
with the assistance of Robinson and Friday, 
to rise and sit at table. The old Indian 
seemed as much struck and astonishe4 at 



238 THE NEW 

every tliino' that lie l)e.hel(l as liis son had 
tomierl y been on his first seeing tl)e effects 
of luiropean industry. 

Fridiiy acted as interpreter in the con- 
versation that iiis master had with the old 
man and the Spaniard. 

Geo. Did Friday understand Spanish? 

Mr. Bill. No ; but ti^.e Spaniard, who 
had been six ninths amongst the savages, 
could speak the hinguage of Friday's conn- 
try tolerably w^W, so that he could under- 
stand him. The following is the substance 
of his account : 

*' Our ship was i)Ound to tlie coast of 
Africa for slaves. We v/ere returning from 
thence, having exchanged all our goods for 
gold dust, elephants teeth, and negroes. 
We had taken a hundred slaves on board, 
and were carrying them to Barbadoes to 
8ell them: twenty of them died on account 
of* our stowing them too close upon one 
another. A violent gale of wind, which 
lasted severa.*^days, drove us out of our 
course, and carried us towards the coast of 

Brasil. 



110 151 ^f SON CRUSOE. ^S9 

Brasil. Our ship sprung a leak, so that we 
durst not trust ourselves out to sea again, 
but coasted along the main land. Suddenly 
we were attacked by another gale from 
the west, that carried us off the coast, and 
in the niiiht we struck ao-ainst some rocks 
not far from an island. We fired several 
guns, and made other signals of distress, 
being resolved not to quit the ship until the 
last extremity. We set the blacks free, 
tliat they might assist us in pumping, as 
the ship leaked in more places than one; 
but the moment they saw tliemselves at 
liberty, they, with one accord, seized our 
boats, being determined, by means of 
them, to save their lives, and escape from 
their masters. 

*' What could we do? It was impossible 
for us to have recourse to force ; we were 
but fifteen against fourscore, aud, besides, 
the greatest |>art of them were armed. On 
the other hand, how coidd we think of re- 
maining on board a wreck without a sin- 
gle boat r This would have been exposing 
ourselves to certain death. We remon- 



240 THE NEW 

strated with them, and even entreated 
them; we endeavoured by our supplications 
to prevail on those who had lately heen 
our slaves, either to remain with us or to 
take us with them. Here I cannot help 
speaking in the highest terms of the hu- 
manity and generosity of :;these blacks. 
Though they had received the most rigor- 
ous treatment from us, yet tliey were moved 
with compassion, and suffered us to get into 
the boats, on condition that we gave up 
our arms. We jumped in, therefore, dis- 
armed, and the boats were so overloaded 
that we expected to sink every moment. 

** However, m'C did every thing in our 
power to reach the island, but suddenly the 
wind changed, aud carried us out to sea 
in spite of the laborious exertions of the 
rowers. Our destruction now appeared no 
lofjo'era matter of doubt : nevertheless, the 
boats, though overloaded and tost about by 
the most violent waves, still had the good 
fortune to live; and, contrary to all expec- 
tation, without losing a single man, we were 

carried

carried to an island jDcrfectly unknown to 
us, where the inhabitants, simple and hu- 
mane, received us with the most hospitable 
benevolence. 

*' We have lived with them ever since, in 
the best manner we could, but still very in- 
diflferentlv. These poor savao-es have no- 
thiup- themselves to subsist on but fishino- 
and a few fruits which the island produces 
spontaneously. They Sihared their little 
stock of provisions with us cheerfully, and 
shewed us their manner of fishing, that \re 
might ourselves provide a part of our sub- 
sistence. The negroes were not so ill off 
as we, both because they were accustomed 
nearly to the same way of living, and also 
because they had recovered their freedom. 

** Some days ago, this island was invad- 
ed by a nation of neighbouring Indians. 
Every one took up arms, and we should 
have thought ourselves wanting in the 
most essential duty of society if we had 
. not assisted people from whom we had re-

fought by the side of tliis brave old man, 
who, like an enraged lion, threw himself 
into the hottest of the combat. I saw him 
surrounded, and would have rescued him, 
hut had the misfortune to l>e made prisoner 
along with him. 

*' In this dreadful captivity wepassed two 
days and twt) nights, bound hand and foot, 
without receiving any nourishment. They

^s>h, «u<:h as the sea kft dead on the beach ; 
•and these they cast to us with as much dis- 
dain as if we had been tl>e vilest of animals. 
'* This morning, at break of day, we were 
^dragged to the canoes, in order to be con- 
veyed to the place where these barbarians 
Av^re accustomed to devour their victims. 
Providence brought you to our assistance ;

-^-se have received more at your hands than

I4e?r€l:l>e Spaniard was silent; being pe- 
netrated

netrated withgratitUcle'j Iie^lied abundance 
of tears. Robinson, for His parf, was dcr 
lighted to find that his fornier conjectures 
Svere amply confirmed, and Friday joined 
him in admiring tlie wisdom and goodness 
of Providence. 

The Spaniard, on being asked M'ho owned 
the ship's cargo, answered, that the vessel 
had been fitted out by two merchants of 
Cadiz ; that one of them had given an or- 
der for the purchase of slaves, but the 
other, detesting this traffic, desired to 
have gold dust in return for his goods. 

Upon this, Robinson took the Spaniard 
by the hand, led him to the cellar, then to 
the storehouse, and shewed him the most 
valuable effects of the wreck safely stowed 
in both places. Friday took upon him to 
recite the particulars concerning them, and 
the Spaniard was so struck with astonish^ 
ment that he could scarce utter a word. 

Robinson enquired also in respect to the 

owner of the diamonds and the officer's 

dress. He was told that they were both part 

M 2 of 



244 THE NEW 

of the effects of an English officer, who,hav 
ing resided maiiy years in the East Indies, 
was returning to England, but, falling sick 
on his way home, he desired to be set ashore 
on the coast of Africa, where he died, and 
his effects were put on board the Spanish 
ship to be conveyed to Barbadoes, whence 
they were afterwards to be sent to England. 
Robinson shewed him also the papers 
that he had taken out of the ship; by 
means of which the Spaniard learned the 
name of the merchant to whom the gold- 
dust belonged, and also that of the officer's 
widow to whom the diamonds and cloaths 
should be restored. From that moment 
Robinson looked upon the gold-dust, the 
diamonds and the papers, as a sacred de- 
posit'entrusted to his care. 

Night approaching, all parties found 
themselves so exhausted by the fatigues 
and dangers of the day, that each one had 
OGcajsioii to retire earlier than usual to seek 
refreshment in sleep. They did, there- 
fore, what we shall also do as soon as we

this day permitted us to: enjoy unin- 
terrupted happiness and tranquillity. 



TWENTY-NINTH EVENING. 



Mr^ bill. The next morning Robin- 
son assembled all the strength of his em-. 
pire, in order to perform an office which 
required this junction, and which could 
not be put off. There was reason to fear 
that the stench of the dead bodies of the 
Indians slain the day before might have a^ 
dangerous effect upon the air : they provi- 
ded themselves, therefore, each with a hat- 
chet, and repaired to this scene of horror. 

Henry. With hatchets? 

Mr, BilL Yes;, not to dig graves: if 

that had been the design, they would have 

provided themselves with shovels, spades, 

M T) and 



and pickakeSj but they intended to out 
dowii wood, and make a pil(5 to buru all 
the ])odies to ashes. 

Rich. That was the custom of the Ro- 
mans. 

3Ir. Bill. And many other nations be- 
sides, llobinson did not (:huse to imitate 
the imprudence of his countrymen, who, at 
that time, buried their dead in the midst of 
towns, and even within their churches,where 
consequently tlie living must breathe an aif 
infected by the disorders of the dea<l. 

Harrkt, Hey ! why they do so stiU, 
papa. 

Mr. Bill, Yes, unfortunately, theydo SO. 
Let this example make you sensible how 
difficult it is for men to abolish ancient cus- 
toms, though universally acknowledged to 
be pernicious : wherefore, I advise you, by 
early application, to acquire wisdom and 
virtue. If once we adopt error and vice, if 
unfortunately we become familiar to them, 
how difficult is it to get rid of tliem, even 
when we are sensible of their danger ! 

Every 



JIOBINSON CRUSOE. ^147 

Every body knows in this age that the 
atench of dead bodies' is poison to the Hv- 
ing, and yet nobody scruples to deposit 
them in burying-grounds in the midst of 
. cities, or even in the vaults of churches, 
where they are not so much as covered 
with earth. Another century and more will 
elapse before people will think seriously of 
abolishing so pernicious a custom. 

Htnry. I wish I were a person in autho- 
rity! I should settle that matter^ 

Mr. Bill, This, my dear, is one of the. 
principal motives that should induce you 
to acquire all the good qualities and all the 
merit possible : then, distinguished by your 
countrymen, they will honsour you with their 
confidence, and confer on you dignities 
which will authorize you to reform daa- 
gerous abuses, and to introduce wholesome ' 
customs. Heaven seems to intend each of^ 
you to be one day the number of those Who " 
are entrusted with the power of promoting ' 
your country's happiness. Evdry thing that.;^ 
is necessary for your attaining so exalted a 
I\l4. trust 



2-4 8 THf. NEW 

trust the goodness of Pro videiicehas bestow- 
ed upon you. You are born of enliglitened 
and virtuous parents, who enjoy the confi- 
dence and love of tlieir country ; you are 
endowed with the happiest qualifications 
of body and Uiind, wliich have never yet 
been spoiled ; and, I may venture to affirm, 
that you are receiving- an education which 
few men have the happiness to receive. It 
would be a disgrace to any of you to frus- 
trate the good intentions of Providence, 
"which has done every tiling to enable you 
to heccme men of a superior class, ^ and ca- 
pable of the greatest things. Your beha- 
viour affords not the smallest doubt in that 
respect. If, as L hope, you should fulfil 
your honourable destiny, if } ou should ar- 
rive one day or other at the rank of those 
powerful men whose actions affect the hap- 
piness of so many thousands, make use of 
the authority entrusted to you to lessen the 
evils and promote the good of your fellow- 
creatures; scatter roundyoujoy, prosperity,

has now given rise to this paternal exhor- 
tation, and, if possible, prevail upon your 
countrymen to bury the dead in places 
where the stench of their bodies may not 
injure the health of the living. 

Edzv, Have patience ! Let me try what 
I can do. When I go to town, I will speak 
of it to my grandpapa and my uncles ; they 
will take care to manage it. 

Mr, Bill. Do, my dear. — Robinson and 
his companions, having burned the dead 
bodies, returned to the dwelling-place. In 
the mean time, Friday informed his father 
of the horror wherewith civilized nations 
look upon the eating of human flesh ; which 
appeared very strange to the old man. But 
Friday, having repeated to him all that he 
had himself learned from his master on the 
subject, gave him at length a disgust to the 
barbarous custom. As the son was called 
Friday, Robinson gave the father the name 
o^ Thttrsdai/ J a.nd thus we shall call him for 
the future. 

Robinson summoned them all to council,- 
M 5 where 



250 i^'THE NEW 

where Ft iday still served as interpreter, and 
his master, as chief, opened the assembly 
•with the following short speech : 

*' My dear friends, all who are present 
see themselves now in possession of what- 
ever can contribute to render their lives 
peaceable and commodious : nevertheless, 
I feel that, in the enjoyment of these good 
things, my heart will never find satisfaction 
while 1 know that there are persons who 
have a greater right to them than I have., 
and yet languish in the want of them. I 
speak of your countrymen, my dear friend, 
my dear European; I speak of the Spaniards 
who are now amongst the savages. 1 wish 
that each of you would communicate to 
me his advice and opinion concerning the 
properest means for bringing those unfor- 
tunate people hither, and making them 
share the same lot with us/* 

After he had finished, each gave his opi- 
nion in his turn. The Spaniard first offered 
to go for them, all alone, in one of the ca- 
noes that they had taken from the Indians. 

Thursday 



ROBINSON C UU SO E. 251' 

Thursday declared that he was ready to un«- 
dertake the same expedition. Friday wa$ 
of opinion, that his father, on account of 
his age, should remain on the island, and 
that he himself, who was filter for the en- 
terprize, should accompany the Spaniard. 
A generous contest arose hetween the fa- 
ther and son, which of them should expos* 
his life; and Robinson was obliged to inter- 
pose, andterminateit by a decision to which, 
they submitted without murmuring. He 
pronounced, that Thursday and the Spa- 
niard shoukKmake the projected attempt, 
and that Friday should remain with him. 

Charlotte. But why did not he send Fri>^ 
day, papa, rather than the poor old man ? 

M)\ Bill. His affectionate friendship fof 
Friday would not permit himto expose hiQ\ 
to a danger which he himself did not shar^ 
with him. Besides, the father knew the seA) 
and could navigate it, better tlian thespq. 
As to the Spaniard, there wa^ 4 naqiegsity 
that he should gp, because, if he did nQh 

M6 his 



252 THE N£W 

his countrymen would, perhaps, not accept 
Robinson's invitation. 

It was, therefore, agreed, that they should 
set sail together as soon as they all four had 
Unished ploughing and sowing a field at 
least ten times larger than that which they 
cultivated before, because the encrease of 
the colony would necessarily occasion a 
greater consumption of tood. 

Each of them, therefore, turned plough- 
man for some weeks, and as they all labour- 
ed with a good will, the work was both very 
vv'.eil and very speedily performed. At the 
( nd ot a fortnight they were ready to pre- 
pare fur the voyage. 

Before iheirdeparture, theSpaniard gave 
a pi oof not only of his honesty and gratitude 
towards Robinson, but also of his prudence 
and circumspection. He represented, that 
the other Spaniards were, like himself, no 
more than common sailors, and, conse- 
qi^entty, people without education ; that he 
did hot know them sufficiently to answer 

for 

■ .-I . t . . ' :'. '. .

for their behaviour ; and that, therefore, 
he was of opinion that Robinson, as mas- 
ter of the island, should draw out an agree- 
ment, expressing the conditions upon 
which they should be received, and that 
none should be admitted without pre- 
viously accepting his terms. 

Robinson, dehghted with this proof of 
his new subject's fidelity, immediately pur- 
sued his advice. The agreement svhich he 
drew up in consequence of it, was worded 
as follows : 

" All persons who are desirous of re- 
siding in Robinson Crusoe's island, and of 
enjoying there the conveniences of life 
which they are invited to share, must con- 
sent, 

** In the first place, to conform in every 
thing to the will of the lawful master of 
the island, and to submit cheerfully to 
whatsoever law^s and regulations the said 
master shall judge necessary for the good 
of the territory. 

** Secondly, 



254 ♦ THE NtW 

*' Secondly, to be active, sober, and vir- 
tuous ; for no idle, drunken, vicious person 
will be tolerated in this island. 

** Thirdly, to abstain from all quarrels, 
and, in case of receiving offence, by no 
means to become judges in their own cause, 
but to carry their complaints before the 
master of the island, or the person to whom 
he shall delegate the office of judge. 

** Fourthly, to join, without murmuring, 
in all the labours which the good of the 
community shall require, and in case of 
necessity, to assist the master of the island 
at the hazard of their lives. 

** Fifthly, should any person presume to 
oppose any one of these just laws, all the 
other members of the community shall be 
bound to unite against him, either to oblige 
him to return to his duty, or to banish him 
for ever from the island. 

"Everyone is advised to consider these 
articles maturely, and not to sign them 
(which would be equal to the obligation of 

aa 



KOEINSON CRUSOE. 255 

an oath), unless he is firmly resolved to 
abide by the conditions of them. 

Signed Robinson Crusoe.'* 

It was settled that the Spaniard should 
translate this agreement into his native 
language, and take pen and ink with him, 
that his countrymen might sign it before 
they embarked. 

They next chose the best of the canoes, 
and prepared for their departure. 

Geo. . But was there room in one canoe 
for all the Spaniards? 

Mr, Bill No: they only wanted this ca- 
noe to sail to the other island : for their re- 
turn they could use the boats belonging to 
the Spanish, ship, which, as the Spaniard de- 
clared, >vere still in very good condition. 
, When their provisions were laid in, the 
wind being favourable, the two deputies set 
sail, after taking a friendly leave of Robin- 
son and Friday. The latter was so affected 
at the separation, that even the day before 
his sorrow had caused him to shed tears for 

hours 



Q66 THE NEW 

hours together, and took from him all de- 
sire of nourishment. At the moment of 
his father's departure he became inconsol- 
able. Every now and then he embraced 
him, and bedewed him with his tears. It 
was not without some difficulty that the 
old man could escape from him to enter 
the canoe, and, even after they had pushed 
off from shore, Friday threw himself into 
the sea, and swam to the side of the boat, 
to shake hands with his father once more, 
and give him his last farewell, which was 
almost stifled with sobs. On his return 
ashore he sat down upon a rising ground, 
where he remained sighing and shedding 
tears with his eyes fixed upon the canoe, 
which scudded before the wind until he 
had entirely lost sight of it. 

Robinson, to amuse him, spent the rest 
of the day with him in shooting game, and 
traversing the hills. They had not gone 
very far, when the spaniel, that accompa- 
nied them, stopped at the foot of a rock all 
overgrown with bushes, and fell a barking. 

- They

i'hey Yv'ent up to him, and observed a hole 
in the rock, which a man could not enter 
without creeping. 

Robinson, m4io loved minutely to exa- 
mine ever}^ thing that drew his attention, 
desired Friday to try if he could get into 
the hole, who, in making tlve trial, had 
scarce put his head withinside, before he 
drew it out again in a hurry, uttered a 
dreadful roar, and ran away with the great- 
est terror and precipitation, never once 
listening to Robinson's voice, who called 
him back repeatedly. At length, overtaking 
him, Robinson asked, with much surprise, 
why he had run away. ** Ah !" replied he, 
scarce able to speak, *^ ah ! my dear mas- 
ter, let us run, let us save ourselves with 
the utmost speed. In that cave is a most 
terrible monster; his eyes are like burn- 
ing fire, and his throat so wide that he 
could swallow us both at once." 

*' A monstrous throat indeed !" said Ro- 
binson : 'M should be curious to see it.'* 

^^Ahl" 



258 THE NEV/ 

**Alv!'* cried Fridayj falling on his knees, 
*^ for Heaven's sake do no such thing. The 
monster would infallibly devour you, and 
then poor Friday would have no master.*' 
**Has it devoured you?" said Robinson, 
smiling. Here Friday hesitated to answer. 
His master, therefore, desired him to hasten 
to the dwelling-place, and fetch a lantern. 
In the mean time, he went back to the 
rock, and stood sentinel before the hole, 
with his musket in his hand. 

Robinson said to himself, ** What could 
Friday have seen to terrify him so ? Was it 
a wild beast? a lion? a tiger? a panther? 
or any such animal ? In that case it would 
certainly be rash of me to enter the hole. 
But if there were such animals in this island, 
1 should have seen some of them long be- 
fore now. Besides, if it had been one, Fri- 
day could not have escaped its claws. No, . 
no ; it is no such thing. His fearfulness 
has deceived him, and made him fancy he 
saw what really was not there to be seen. 

I will

I will know what it'is, were it only to ciirc 
this good young man of his childish apt- 
ness to be frightened." 

Friday now arrives with the lantern 
lighted. He endeavoured once more, with 
tears inhiseyes, to dissuade his inasterfrom 
exposing himself to a danger which he said 
was so evident, and in which he would in* 
evitably meet his ruin. Robinson was a 
stranger to fear ; when he had once de- 
termined upon a step from tnature reflec- 
tion, he \vas afterwards immoveable : ex- 
horting Friday, therefore,, to take cou- 
rage, he advanced boldly towards the ca- 
vern, with a lantern in one hand, and a 
loaded pi»tol in the other. 

His head was scarce wrthinside of the 
hole, when, by the feeble light of the lan- 
tern, he perceived an object which really 
madehimshudder; nevertheless, hedid not 
run away. Holding his lantern farther in, 
the better to discover this unknown mon- 
ster, he found it to be a lama that was dying 
of old age. Looking round, and perceiving 

no 



0,60 . THE NEW 

no other animal than the harmless lama, he 
crept entirely into the cavern, and bid Fri- 
day follow him. 

The poor fellow was all of a tremble, 
yet he could not think of abandoning his 
master ; he, therefore, made a noble effort 
to overcome his fear, and, in short, had the 
courage to creep into the hole, after him, 
where he saw with astonishment how much 
his fright had deceived him with regard to 
the, great fiery eyes: and huge throat of the 
animal. ,, ;\.|<f • 

As he entered, Robinson said to hirn^ 
smiHng, ** Well, Friday, you see what fear 
can make us believe. Nowi where are the 
great blazing eyes ? Where is that prodi- 
gious throat that you saw ?" 

Frid, And yet I really thought I saw 
them ; nay, I could have sworn it. 

Rob, Tha^ you thought so I have not 
the least doubt; but you ought, to have 
known how deceitful fear is, and that its 
delusions make us seem to see a thousand 
things which never existed. Believe me, 

Friday, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^6i 

Friday, it is the foundation of all stories 
concerning ghosts, and I know not what 
idle fancies of the same sort. The first 
tellers of these absurd tales were fearful 
old women, or cowardly men of the same 
stamp. They imagined, like you, that they 
saw something which they did not see ; 
and, like you too, just now, they would 
have sworn that they saw what they did 
not see. Be a man, Friday; for the future 
always look twice ; and banish from your 
breast this fearful ness, which would be 
scarce excusable in a girl. Friday pro- 
mised to do his best. 

While they were talking, the old lama 
expired. Robinson and Friday dragged it 
but of the hole, in order to bury it. They 
next more attentively examined the spot 
Avhere they were, and found it to be a very 
spacious and agreeable cave, which they 
might in future turn to advantageous uses. 
It appeared as if hewn out by design : it 
Sv.as' odol without the least dampness ; and 
the walls, which seemed to be of crystal, 

reflected 



reflected the light from all sides with as 
much splendour as if it had been a draw- 
ing-room brilliantly lighted up. 

Robinson resolved to convert it into an 
agreeable retreat, where he might enjoy a 
refreshing coolness during the hotter part 
of the day, and also lodge any of his pro- 
visions that were liable to be spoiled by 
the heat. Luckily it was no more than a 
short mile from the dwelling-place, whither 
Friday presently repaired, and brought 
back tools, with which thej' both fell to 
AV'ork to enlarge the entrance. They in- 
tended to make a door, and this task em- 
ployed them agreeably during the absence 
of their two deputies.

EDIVARD. Every time now that papa

dread over me. 

J\I)\ BilL What are you afraid of, my 
dear? 

Edzc\ That it will be the last evening. 

Geo. If i were papa, I would make it last 
so long — that it should not finish at all. 

Mr. Bill. My dear children, all our plea- 
sures here below are bounded ; this must 
also have an end, and you will do well to 
prepare yourselves before-hand for the con- 
clusion of Robinson's adventures. How- 
ever, even now a storm is rising, as you will 
soon see ; I cannot answer for the conse- 
quences of it ; be on your guard. 

A week was now elapsed without any 
appearance of the deputies. They began 
to be uae^y ;^l>out them, Friday ri^n 

twenty 



264 THE NEW 

twenty times a day to the top of the hillock 
or the sea-side, and wearied his eyes to no 
purpose in looking out for them. One day 
when Rohinson was busy at the dwelling-' 
place, Friday came towards him full speed, 
singing, jumping, and bawling like a mad- 
man, while he was still as far off as he could 
see his master, — * ' They are coming I — they 
are coming !*' 

At these agreeable tidings Robinson took 
his prospect glass, and hastened to the top 
of the hillock. With his naked eye he could 
perceive at a distance a boat making sail 
towards his island ; but when he put the 
prospect glass to his eye, the joy that was 
in his countenance disappeared, and he said 
to Friday, shaking his head, ** I doubt whe- 
ther those are the people that we wish for." 
Friday at these words turned pale. 

Robinson looked at the object a second 
time, and his doubt was now changed into 
uneasiness. At last, being convinced that 
they were not his friends who were in the 
boat, he communicated his alarms to Fri- 
day,

day, who was already much disquieted. 
** My friend," said he, ** they are neither 
the Spaniards nor your father ; it is an Eng- 
lish boat with English sailors in it.** Fri- 
day began to tremble from head to foot. 
" Follow me," said Robinson, taking the 
road to an eminence from whence they 
could better discover the northern coast. 
Scarce had they reached it and looked out 
to sea, when tliey were struck motionless, 
and, as it were, petrified with astonishment. 
They perceived, at the distance of about a 
couple of leagues, a large English ship 
lying at anchor. 

Surprise, fear, and joy, seized Robinson's 
breast by turns : joy at the sight of a ship 
which might perhaps carry him to his own 
country; surprise and fear, because he could 
not conceive what had brought an English 
ship upon these coasts. It could not be a 
storm ; the weather had been quite calm for 
some weeks. Nor could the ship's course 
have occasioned her to come that way. 
What reason could the captain have for 

Vol. li. N sailing 



itSO THE NEW 

sailing towards parts of the world witere the 
English have neither settlements nor trade? 
He apprehended, therefore, that they might 
be pirates. 

Henry. What are they ? 

M7\ Bill. There are men to be found, 
who have been so ill instructed in their 
earlier years as not even to know that theft 
is a crime. These wretches make no scru- 
ple of taking away other people's property, 
either by fraud or violence. If they do 
this on land, they are cdWtd thieves or roh-'' 
hers I if on sea, they are called pirates^ 
JreebooterSy and the like. - 

JEdw, But these were Englishmen. 

Mr, Bill. So they appeared to be, it is 
true ; but it was possible that they might 
bd outlaws and pirates, who having seized 
upon an English ship, had dressed them- 
selves in English clothing. Besides, Eng- 
land has at all times produced as many 
thieves and -robbers as other countries.

of help and society, Robinson would have 
thought himself happy, had he fallen into 
the hands of pirates, been carried away 
a slave, and thus restored once more to 
the society of men ; but now that his situa^ 
tion was much more agreeable, he trembled 
at the idea of being carried away by such 
marauders. He imparted his apprehen- 
sions to Friday, and they retired in order 
to observe at a distance, those who were 
coming in the boat, and endeavour to dis- 
cover their design. 

Robinson and Friday posted themselves 
on a rising ground that was covered with 
trees and underwood, from whence, with- 
out being perceived, they could have an 
eye upon whatever passed. They saw the 
boat, with eleven men in it, come to land 
at a part of the shore that was smooth and 
sandy, and about a mile from the place 
where they were. The strangers landed; 
eight of them were armed, and the other 
three tied neck and heels. These they un- 
bound as soon as they were upon the beach.

By the countenance and actions of one of 
them in particular, they judged that he was 
soliciting the compassion of those who were 
armed : he fell at their feet in the posture 
of a suppliant. The other two now and 
then lifted up their hands to Heaven, as if 
to implore succour and deliverance. 

Robinson, shocked and grieved at this 
sight, knew not what to resolve on : mean- 
time, Friday approached him with an arr 
of triumph, and whispered, *'Well, I find, 
master, your countrymen eat their prison- 
ers too." *^ Pshaw !" said Robinson, a little 
out of humour, ^* thev will do no such 
thing :" and he continued to observe them 
with his prospect glass. 

It was not without shuddering that he 
saw some of those who were armed lift up 
their hangers several times over the head 
of him who was on his knees before them. 
At last, he observed that the prisoners were 
left alone, while the others dispersed them- 
selves in the woods. 

All three sat down with sorrowful and 

desponding 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 269 

desponding hearts on the spot where the 
rest left them. 

This sight reminded Robinson of his own 
deplorable situation the day he was cast 
ashore upon the island, and it inspired him 
with the resolution of risking eveny. thing 
for the preservation of these unfortunate 
people, if they should prove deserving gf it. 
Having thus determined, he sent Friday 
home with orders to bring as many guns, 
pistols, hangers, and as much ammunition, 
as he could carry. 

Harriet. What is ammunition ? 
3Ir. Bill. Powder and ball. Robinson 
thought proper to stay upon the spot and 
observe what passed. Friday having per- 
formed his errand, and all the fire-arms 
being charged, they observed with satisfac- 
tion that the sailors, being scattered about, 
were lain down in the shade, here and there, 
to sleep, duringtheviolentheatof the noon-^ 
day. Robinson, having waited a quarter of 
an hour, advanced confidently towards the 
three prisoners, who were still sitting in the 
N 3 same 



-70 THE N'EW 

same spot with tlieir backs to him. When 
llobiiisoH, approaching them, called out 
siiddeiily, *^ \\'ho are you ?" they were all 
three thunder-struck. 

They started up, and were going to run 
away; but Robinson bade them fear nothing, 
for he was come to assist them. ** You are, 
tlien, sent from Heaven," said one of them, 
taking off his hat respectfully, and survey- 
ing him with the greatest astonishment. 
"All assistance comes from Heaven, "replied 
Robinson ; " but not to lose time, tell me 
in what consists your distress, and how I 
can reheve you." '' I am captain of that 
ship," said one of them ; then pointing to 
his companions, *^ this,'* continued he, 
" was my mate, and that gentleman a pas- 
senger. My sailors mutinied and seized the 
sliip; their intention at first was to kill 
me, and these my two companions, for find- 
ing fault with their behaviour: however, 
they have at length yielded to ourentreaties 
anxl spared our lives ; but this boon is al- 
most as bad as death itself. They expose

US on this desart island, where, being in 
want of every thing, we are sure to perish 
miserably. 

^' On two conditions," said Robinson, 
** I will risk my blood and my life to relieve 
you from this extremity." 

"Generous man ! let us but know what 
they are," said th© captain* 

**They are these: While you remain 
upon this island, you shall conform in every- 
thing to my will ; and, if I succeed in re- 
covering for; you the pos.'icssion of your 
ship, you shall give me and my companion 
a free passage to England." " We, the ship, 
and all that it contains, shall be wholly at 
your disposal," replied the captain. 

**Very well," said Robinson, *VLput a 
musket and a sword into each of your 
hands, on condition that you shall not use 
them until I think propen Your assassins, 
are now asleep and dispersed one from 
the other: come; let us try and master 
them without spilling any blood." 

They set forward. Friday (parried with

liim the cords which had'been taken off the 
three prisoners. The first sailor that they 
came up to lay with his face to the ground, 
and slept so soundly that they seized him 
by the hands and feet, and crammed a hand- 
kerchief into his mouth, before he was welt 
awake. They tied his hands behind his 
back, and commanded him to remain on 
the spot without stirring an inch, or 
making the least noise, on pain of being 
put to death that . mom.ent. They made 
him turn his head towards the sea, that he 
might not observe what was passing 
amongst his comrades. 

The second met with the same treatment ; 
he was tied hand and foot, turned, and 
threatened in the same manner. Fortune, 
or, more property speaking. Providence 
appeared on this occasion the protector of 
innocence and avenger of villainy. Six of 
them were now tied, but the two last 
awoke, started up, and took their arms. 
"Wretches!" cried Robinson to them, ''see 
where your companions lie ; be assured we 

are 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 273 

are superior to you in force ; lay down 
your arms this very instant ; the least delay 
may cost you your lives !" 

They threw down their arms, and, in 
their turn, fell upon their knees to entreat 
their captain's pardon. Their hands being 
tied in the same manner as those of the 
rest, they were all conducted to the cavern 
which had been lately discovered, thereto 
be confined. They were then informed 
that the guard who was to have the care 
of them would shoot the first man through 
the head who should attempt to come out^ 
at the door. It was also thought expedient 
to take their knives away. 

After this, Robinson and Friday, with 
their new friends, went down to the boat : 
they drew it up on the beach, and bored 
holes in its bottom to render it for the pre- 
sent unfit for use. 

Henry. Why did they do so ? 

Mr. Bill. They foresaw, that, when the 

first boat did not return, the people aboard 

Vv'ould send a second. They chose, there- 

N 5 fore, 



':7-^ THE yEW 

fore, to put it out of their power to take 
back the first. 

What they expected happened accord- 
ingly. Ahoiit 3 o'clock in the afternoon, 
the. ship fired a gun for the sailors who were 
on shore to return. This signal not being 
obeyed, though thrice repeated, they saw 
another boat put off from the ship towards 
the island. Robinson, with his companions, 
retired to a rising ground, in order from 
thence to observe what measure circum- 
stances might require them to pursue. 

The boat having come to land-, the men 
jumped out and ran to the first, but were 
not a little surprised to see it drawn up a 
good way on th€ beach, and with holes in 
its bottom. They looked all round, aud 
called their companions by their names, 
but nobody answered. They were ten in 
number, all well armed. 

Robinson, being informed by the captain, 
that amoiigat those whom they had made 
prisoners, there were three who from fear 
aioa-e had joined in the mutiny^ sent Fri- 
day 



ROBIKSON CRUSOE. 275 

day and the mate for them immediately. 
On their appearance, the captain, to whom> 
Robinson had communicated his design, 
after reproaching them a little for their be- 
haviour, asked them, whether, if he should 
pardon them, they would remain faithful to 
him for the future. " To the last moment of 
our lives,'' they said^ trembling, and fall- 
ing on their knees. ** Before this mutiny," 
continued the captain, ** I always took you 
for honest men, and am willing to believ^e 
that you were forced to take a part in it. 
I hope, however, you will make amends for 
the past by being steady and faithful in 
future." The three sailors, heartily re- 
penting of their folly, shed tears of joy on-" 
being forgiven.:. The captain gave them 
back their arms, and desired them to yield a^ 
punctual obedience to their camirton ehief*' 
In the.meattntime, the people of the se-f 
Gondboat were continually calling oat,and- 
now and then firing their guns^^with the^ 
expectation that their scatter^. -^omradea*' 
N 6 would 



Ci76 THE NEW 

would hear and join them. At last, find- 
ing all their researches useless, and the day 
now drawing to a close, they hegan to fear 
for themselves ; they put off therefore, in- 
tending to lie at anchor about a hundred 
yards from the shore. The captain and 

Robinson were apprehensive lest theyshould 
go back to the ship, and the crew should 
take the resolution of setting sail and going 
oif with the vessel, and not wait longer to 
search for their strayed companions. This 
apprehension filled Robinson and the rest 
with much anxiety. 

Luckily a thought struck him, from 
which they promised themselves great suc- 
cess. He ordered Friday and one of the 
sailors to go behind the thickets, about a 
naile from the boat, and answer the men 
whenever they called ; then, as soon as they 
perceived that the others heard them, they 
were to go farther in by degrees amongst 
the underwood, in order to draw the sailors 
after them to as great a distance as possible 

from 



ROBllS'SON CRUSOE. ^17 

from shore ; and, having done this, Friday 
and the sailor were to return as quick as 
they could by another way. 

This stratagem succeeded completely. 
No sooner did the sailors in the boat hear 
a voice answer them, than they hastened 
to land again, and taking their muskets, 
ran towards the quarter from whence they 
heard the voice. Two were left to guard 
the boat. 

Friday and his companion performed 
their part admirably. They drew the sai- 
lors after them amongst the thickets about 
three miles from the shore, and then they 
hastened back with all speed to join their 
commanders. In the mean time, Robinson 
had unfolded to the captain his whole plan 
for mastering these people without blood- 
shed. 

Night now came on, and it grew by de- 
grees darker and darker. Robinson and his^ 
companions advanced silently towards the' 
boat, till within about twenty yards of it, 
unperceived by the two sailors who guarded 

it; 



278 THE NB-vr 

it; tllen they all shewed themselves at oncCy 
and with much noise and clatteringof their 
arms, threatened the two men with instant 
death if they dared to stir a step. They 
begged for quarter, upon which Robin- 
son's party went up to them and tied their 
hands. This done, they made haste to 
draw up the boat to a considerable distance 
from the water, led away their two prison- 
ers, and concealed themselves behind the 
bushes, to wait for the return of the other 
sailors. They came back straggling one 
after another, and all exceedingly fatigued 
with their unsuccessful expedition. Their 
astonishment and vexation at not finding 
the boat is impossible to be expressed. As 
soon as there were five of them together, 
one of those who had been pardoned was 
sent to them to ask whether they chose to 
lay down their arms and surrender that mo- 
ment without murmuring ; adding, that, 
in case of their refus-al, the governor of the 
island had posted a detachment of fifty men 
ijtot thirty yards off/ whose fire eouUl not 

possibly

possibly miss them though it was dark ; 
that the governor's people had already ta- 
ken their boats, and ma<le all the rest of 
their companions prisoners ; sa that there 
was no choice left them but either to sur- 
render or die. 

At the same time Robinson and his com- 
pany made a clattering with their arms, 
to confirm the sailor's account of their 
number. '* Can we hope for pardon?" said 
one of them. The captain,, who was unseen, 
answered, *^ Thomas Smith, you know my 
voice; lay down your arms instantly, and 
you shall all have your lives spared, except 
Atkins.'* He, it seems, was the principal 
ringleader of the mutiny. 

They all immediately threw down their 
arms. Atkins begged for mercy, entreated 
the captain's compassion, and represented 
to him that he was not more guilty thaa 
the rest. The captain answered him, that 
all he could do was to intercede for him 
with the governor, and he must wait the ef- 
fect of that intercession. Then Friday and 

the 



£80 THE NEW 

the three sailors were sent to tie their hands; 
and the other three mutineers returning at 
the same time from their ramble among the 
thickets, they were informed of what had 
passed, and dropping all thoughts of resist- 
ance, submitted to be tied with the rest. 

Upon this, Robinson, as one of the go- 
vernor's officers^ came forward to the pri- 
soners. The captain, who accompanied him, 
chose out those whom he thought capable 
of a sincere repentance ; these were sent to 
be lodged near the entrance of the dwel- 
ling place ; the others were put into the 
cavern. Amongst those who had been put' 
there before, there were two whom the cap- 
tain thought to be equally disposed to re- 
turn faithfully to their duty, and these 
were ordered to be brought to him. 

To-morrow evening, my dear child reu, 
you shall have the sequel of this adventure.

AIR, bill. My dear children,, we now 
draw near the conclusion : Robinson's lot 
will soon be decided : a few hours more 
and our friend will know whether he is- 
sentenced to remain in his island without 
hopes of quitting it, or whether he shall be 
able to gratify his most earnest wish of 
again seeing his parents. 

This depends on the captain's success-. 
Will he, or will he not, with the assistance 
of the sailors who have returned to their, 
duty, be able to make himself master of 
the ship ? If he can, all our friend's anxiety 
will be at an end; if not, things will re- 
main as they arcj and he must not think 
of leaving the island. 

Those whose lives had been promised 
them, were lodged, as before mentioned, 
near the entrance of the dwelling place ; 
they were ten in number. Robinson in- 
formed them, as from the governor, that 

their 



2.S2 THE NEW 

their offence being mutiny, tliey should not 
receive a full pardon, but on the condition 
of assisting their lawful commander to re- 
cover possession of his shi}). They all pro- 
tested that they would perform this condi- 
tion with the greatest chearfulness and fide- 
lity. Robinson added, that if they acquitted 
themselves properly of this just and reason- 
able duty, they would not only exempt 
themselves from all manner of punishment, 
but also save the lives of their comrades in 
prison, who, if the ship was not recovered 
that very night, were all to be hanged the 
next morning at break of day. 

This was also told to the prisoners: they- 
were then left together for a while, that, 
in this interview, the criminals threatened 
withspeedy death might confirm the others 
intheir fidelity, which was the only possi- 
ble means that could save their lives. 

In the mean time, the shipV carpenter 
was ordered Immediately to repair the boat 
that had been scuttled ; and as soon as this 
was done, they launched them both. It 

was

was agreed, that the captain should coiii- 
inand one^ and the mate the other, the crew 
being equally divided belweenthem. Every 
man was provided with arniis and ammuni- 
tion. Robinson took the captain by the 
hand, and wished him good success- The 
two boats now set sail. 

Edxv, I wonder that Robinson did not 
go with them. 

Mr. Bill It was not for want of courage ; 
but prudence did not permit him to go 
upon this expetlition. The prisoners in his 
absence might ^escape, and make them^ 
selves masters of hi« dwelling place. This 
being his only retreat in case of danger, 
and containing all his resources, was of too 
much consequence to him that he should- 
imprudently run the risk of losing it. The 
captain himself saw the propiety of this 
" consideration, and wasof opinion that Ro- 
binson and Friday should stay and guard 
their little fortress. 

Robinson, whose destiny was now going 
to be decided, felt an anxiety and agitation 
of mind tbat did not sufler him to rest. 



-84 THE NEW 

Sometimes he sat down in the cave^. 
sometimes he waikecJ about upon the ter- 
race, and sometimes he went up the ladder 
of ropes to the top of the hillock, to take 
advantage of the silence of the night, and 
listen whether any thing was to be heard 
from that quarter where the ship lay. 
Though he had scarce 'taken any nourish- 
ment the whole day, he could not prevail 
upon himself to do it now. His anxiety 
was continually encreasing, because he ex- 
pected the signal that had been agreedupon 
between them ; three guns were to be the 
token pf the captain's success, and it was 
already midnight. He at length reflected, 
that he was wrong to fluctuate between 
hope and fear, so tremhiingl^ alive to both ; 
and lie seasonably recollected a maxim with 
whicb he had, not long ago, endeavoured 
to fortify his man Friday. '' In a doubt- 
ful case," said he, '* always expect the 
worst. If this worst does not happen, so 
much the better for you ; if it does, you are 
prepared for it, and have already destroyed 
half its power to hurt." 



ROBINSOTJ CRUSOE. 285 

Consequently, Robinson considered as 
indubitable the ill success of the expedi- 
tion. He mustered up all his fortitude and 
resignation to Providence, to enable him 
to support this misfortune. He now gave 
up all hope— when, suddenly, the deep and 
distant sound of a gun was heard. As if 
he had been roused out of his sleep, he 

listens a second report^ — then a third ! 

There is no longer any room for doubt : 
the captain has recovered the ship, and 
will very speedily set sail for Europe. 

Intoxicated with joy, he flies, he slides 
down the ladder, throws his hands round 
Friday's neck, who lay asleep upon the 
grassy slope of the terrace ; he presses him 
to his bosom, and bedews him with his 
tears, unable to utter a single word. *' What 
is the matter, my dear master ?" said Fri- 
day opening his eyes, and terrified at all 
this hurry and sudden overflow of affec- 
tion. "Ah! Friday!" was all the answer 
that Robinson, in the fulness of his joy; 
could return. 

'* Heaven 



28!) THE NEW 

*' Heaven have compassion of my poor 
master's head!" said Friday to himself, 
imagining him to have lost his senses. 
*' You must go to bed, my dear master;'* 
and at the same time he was taking him by 
the arm to lead him to the cave. Robin- 
son, in a tone of voice which expressed his 
transport, cried, **Me! me to bed ! Friday, 
at the very moment when Heaveix is crown- 
ing the only wish that my heart has che- 
rished so long I Did you not hear the three 
guns ? Know you not that they are happily 
masters of the ship ?" 

Friday, on being informed of this for- 
tunate event, rejoiced, it is true, but more 
on his master's account than his own. The 
thoughts of soon quitting his native cli- 
mate for ever, damped the satisfaction 
which he would otherwise have enjoyed in 
going with Robinson and his father to a 
country from whence so many wonderful 
things had already been presented to his 
view, and where he expected to see others 
still more marvellous. 

Robinson 



ROBINSON^ CRUSOE. 287 

Robiusofl was never so affected with the 
transports of joy before. Sometimeshewent 
up to the top of the hillock, threw himself 
on his face, liftsd up his eyes towards the 
starry vault, and returned God thanks for 
having at length procured him. the means 
of departing from this desert island ; pre- 
sently he would go down again, shake his 
dearFriday by the hand, talk of nothing but 
Plymouth and Exeter, and begin to pack 
up the goods. In this agitation he passed 
the night without once thinking of repose. 

At the first peep of dawn his eyes were 
turned towards that quarter where the ship 
lay at anchor. He waited with impatience 
for the momentwhen broad day-lightshould 
give him a full view of the instrument of 
his deliverance. The moment comes — 
Heaven ! is it possible ? — Dreadful idea! — 
He sees, without the smallest room for 
doubt — that the ship is no longer there. 
He shrieks, and falls down in a swoon. 

Friday ran to him, but was a long time 
before he could comprehend what was the 

matter 



28B THE NEW 

matter with his master. At length, Ro- 
binson, stretching his trembling hand to- 
wards the sea, *' Look there !" said he, 
with a feeble and almost inarticulate voice. 
Friday no sooner turned his head that way 
than he discovered the cause of his master's 
grief. 

I see, my dear children, you know not 
which sentiment to indulge. You are di- 
vided between joy and compassion. You 
hope that this incident will prolong the 
story; but our friend's melancholysituation 
moderates and restrains the liveliness of 
your satisfaction. You all maintain a pro- 
found silence ; I will take advantage of it 
and go on. 

Robinson shews us here, by hi& example, 
how careful even the best men should be 
not to suffer their passions to get the better 
of them. If he had not at first indulged an 
immoderate joy, he would not afterwards 
have fallen into an excessive degree of sor- 
row, which entirely darkened his reason ; 
he would have been sensible that he ought to 

support 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 289 

support the shock with resignation, though 
it destroyed his dearest hopes; he would 
have reflected thatProvidence has means to 
rescue us from distress, even when we think 
it impossible. This reflection would have 
contributed to restore him to tranquillity. 
Once more, my dear children, you see how 
much remains to be amended even in per- 
sons the most forward in the path of virtue. 
While Robinson Avas desponding, and 
Friday endeavouring to comfort him, they 
suddenly heard a noise at the back of the 
liillock as of several people walking. They 
rise in a hurry, and looking on that side 
from whence the noise came, they were 
agreeably surprised to behold the captain 
coming up the hillock, accompanied by 
some of his people. Robinson sprung for- 
ward to take him by the hand, and happen- 
ing to turn himself that way he perceived 
the ship at anchor in a creek on tha western 
side of the island. Judge whether his grief 
was banished in a moment. This sight in- 
formed him at once that the captain had 
Vol. II. O and 



<290 THE NEVI' 

changed his station before the break of 
(lay, and moored the ship in that safe and 
commodious harbour. 

Robinson was so overjoyed that lie could 
not quit the captain, who on his side was no 
less delighted. They thanked and congra- 
tulated each other a tliousand times. The 
captain related the manner of his becoming- 
master of theship without killingor wound- 
ing a single person. The night was so dark 
that the mutineers never saw him, and so 
made not the least difficult}^ in receiving 
those on board who accompanied him. The 
most refractory were going, it is true, to 
stand upon their defence, but their resist- 
ance would have been vain; they, would 
immediately have been overpowered and 
laid in irons. When he had finished his re*- 
cital, he indulged his feelings of gratitude 
to his deliverer. *' It is you,*' said he, with 
tears in his eyes, '* it is you, generous man ! 
who by your compassion and prudence have 
saved me and restored my ship. It is now 
yoUrs ; you shall dispose both of that and 
me at your pleasure." He then ordered the 



ROBIWSON CRUSOE. 29^ 

men to lay on the table some refreshments 
that he had brought from the ship, and the 
whole company, with hearts full of joy, sat 
down to an excellent breakfast. 

In the mean time, Robinson related his 
strange adventures, which more than once 
excited the captain's highest admiration. 
The latter entreated Robinson to tell him 
what he should do for him. '' Besides what 
I stipulated yesterday," answered he, '^in 
return for the assistance that I afforded you, 
^ j have three things more to desire of you. 
In the first place, I request you to wait the 
return of the Spaniards and my man Fri- 
day's father : 2dly, to receive aboard your 
ship, not only me and my people, but also 
all the Spaniards, whom you will land in 
their own country, sailing to Cadiz for that 
purpose : lastly, to pardon the principal 
mutineers, and to punish them no other- 
wise than by letting them remain here on 
»>y island, as I am persuaded that it will 
be the best way to reform them." 

The captain having assured him that these 
articles should be punctually performed^ 
02 



!2g2 THE NEW 

sent for the prisoners, picked out the most 
guilty, and told them their sentence, which 
they heard with a degree of satisfaction, * 
very well knowing that by law they were 
liable to be put to death. Robinson, ever 
full of humanity, gave them instructions 
concerning the manner of procuring them- 
selves subsistence, and promised to leave 
them what was his best treasure in the 
island, namely, his tools, his furniture, and 
his cattle. At the same time he recom- 
mended to them, over and over, to put their 
trust in Heaven, to agree together, and to 
be industrious, assuring them that the prac- 
tice of these virtues would not a little con- 
tribute towards renderiiig their confine- 
ment in this island agreeable. 

He wasstiil speaking- when Friday, out of 
breath, brought the pleasing news that his 
father was coming with the Spaniards, and 
that they were that moment landing. All 
the company prepared to go and rpeet them. 
Friday flev/ to the sea-side, and embraced 

his 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. '29^ 

his father again and again, hefore the rest 
came up. 

Robinson saw M'ith surprise, that, amongst 
those who came in the boats, there were 
two women. He questioned Thursday con- 
cerning them, who told him that they were 
natives whom the tM-o Spaniards had niar- 
ried. As soon as- these two Spaniards 
learned that Robinson was going away, and 
intended to leave some sailors behind him 
upon the island, they requested permission 
to remain there also with their wives, 
alledging that, after the accounts which 
they had heard of this island, they could 
not desire a better establishment. 

Robinson, charmed at their request, most 
readilyconsentedtoit. He was well pleased 
that two men should remain upon his island, 
of whom all their comrades gave the most 
excellent character, as it was possible that 
they might bring back the mutineers, with 
Avhom they were left, to a regular and 
peaceable life. With this view he resolved 
to give the Spaniards a degree of authority 
over t}iem. 



2<^4 THE NEV 

Those who were to be left on the island 
were six Englishmen, and two SpJiniards 
with their wives. Robinson called the whole 
together, and declared his will to them in 
the i'ollowing words. 

** I hope none of yon will dispute my 
right to de as I please with the property of 
this island and all that belongs to it. I wish 
equal happiness to all of you who remain 
here after me. To secure it, there must be 
a certain order and subordination amongst 
you, which it belongs only to me to pre- 
scribe. I declare, therefore, that I appoint 
the two Spaniards as substitutes in my place, 
and that they shall for the future be the law- 
ful masters of the island. You shall all 
pay them the strictest obedience; they alone 
shall have possession of the little fort and 
live there; they alone shall have under their 
care all the arms, ammunition, and tools, 
but which they will lend you, whenever you 
hav€ occasion for them, provided you be 
qiiret kml peaceable. In all dangers you 
sh a H u n'rt e fp r th e c o m m o n d e f e n c e . Your

labours both in thegard^naiulthe field shal'l 
be performed in common, and every crop 
be equally divided amongst you all. Per- 
haps one day or other I may have an oppor- 
tunity of hearing from you. Perhaps I 
may even resolve to come and finish my 
days in this island, such an affection do I 
feel for it even at this moment. Then woe 
be to him who shall have infringed niy re- 
gulations ! He shall beshcAvedno co!)ipas- 
sion, but set adrift in a slight boat, to take 
his chance upon the open sea, let the wea- 
ther be ever so unfavourable." 

They all agreed to these regulations, and 
promised the most perfect obedience. 

Robinson then took an inventory of the 
few goods that he intended to carry away 
Avithhim, and which were to be immediately 
put on board the ship. They were 1st, the 
dress of skins that he had made for himself, 
together with the umbrella and the mask : 
2dly, the spear, the how ami arrows, and 
the stone hatchet, which were also his own 
workmanship : Sdly, Poll, the spaniel, and 
two lamas: 4thly, several utensils and pieces

of furniture, which he liad made while he 
was alone: ,5tlily, the gold-dust and dia- 
monds ;,and, lastly, the lump of gold which 
wa3 his own property. 

All these articles being carried aboard, 
and the wind favourable, their departure 
was fixed for the next day. Robinson and 
Friday prepared a dinner, by way of enter- 
tainment before their departure, for the 
captain and those who were to compose the 
future colony on the island. They served 
up the best of every thing that was amongst 
their provisions, and the victuals were so 
well prepared, that the captain could not 
sufficiently admire Robinson's skill in enter- 
taining his company. The captain, to imi- 
tate the generosity of his host, and to con- 
tribute in some measure to the welfare of 
the new inhabitants of the island, ordered 
a quantity of provisions to be brought from 
the ship, together with gunpowder, iron, 
and working tools, all which he bestowed 
as a present on the colony. 

Towards evening, Robinson made his 
excuses, and begged permission to be alone 



ROBrN'^SOi^ CRUSOE. ^97 

for an hour, alledging that there remained 
some important business which he wished 
to settle before his departure. Every one 
withdrawing, he went to the top of the 
hillock; ther^ he revolved in his mind the 
series of events that had happened during 
his abode upon the island, and his heart, full 
of the liveliest filial gratitude, opened itself 
in thanksgiving to his Supreme Benefactor. 
How shall I express his pious acknowledge- 
ments ? But hearts like his will find in their 
own feelings the expression of those senti- 
ments which 1 want words to interpret. 
Thetime of their departure being arrived, 
Robinson affectionatelyexhorted thecolony 
to be unanimous, industrious, and, above 
all, religious ; and, bearing in his breast a 
regard for the welfare oTthe whole, he re- 
commends them as his brothers to that di- 
vine protection which he had always won- 
derfully experienced. He looks round once 
more with inward satisfaction: again he 
thanks Heaven both foi' preserving him hi- 
therto, and for delivering him atpresent by 
O 5 a miracle 



298 THE x\LW 

a miracle of goodness and wisdom : for the 
last time, he bids farewell to the inhabit- 
ants whom he leaves in the island, but in 
a voice scarcely to be heard. At length he 
goes aboard, accompanied by Thursday 
and Friday. 

Some of the. Children. Now the story is 
ended. 

Rich. Pray, have patience ; who knows 
whether some obstacle may not yet happen 
to hinder his departure? 

Mr, Bill The wind was fresh, and blew 
so favourably that the island seemed to 
withdraw from them very fast. As long as 
it was in sight, Robinson, standing upon 
the deck in mournful silence, kept his eyes 
fixed upon the spot, which, from his having 
lived upon it for 12 years, and experienced 
and surmounted many distresses there, 
was become almost as dear to him as his 
own native country. At length, having 
lost sight of the island, and the top of its 
highest hill, he retired into the cabin with 
'i hursday and Friday, in order to relieve 

the

the oppression of his thoughts ia the 
amusement of friendly conversation. 

They had a very fine voyage, and in 
twenty-four days cast anchor in the har- 
hour of Cadiz, where they landed all their 
Spanish passengers. Robinson went into 
the town to enquire for the merchant to 
whom the barrel of gold: dust belonged 
which he had saved from the wreck. Pie 
was fortunate enough to find him, and to 
learn that the honest merchant, by reco- 
vering this gold, would be extricated from 
the greatest difficulties. The loss of his ship 
had been followed by the most disagreeable 
consequences : it had thrown his affairs 
into such confusion that he Jailed. 

Henry. Failed ? how ? 

J/r. Bill, When a man owes more than 
he can pay, he gives up whatever property 
he has remaining to be divided proportion- 
ably amongst his creditors, who thus lose 
each of them more or kss ; and in this case 
a man is said to become bankrupt, or to 
fail. 

The barrel of gold-dust was more than 



300 'fHE Vew ' ' 

sufficient to pay off the merchant's debts. 
Penetrated with gratitude, he wished to 
bestow the remainder upon his benefactor. 
Robinson, far-from accepting it, declared 
that he was already too well rewarded in 
the satisfaction of having prevented the 
ruin of an honest merchant. 

From Cadiz they set sail for England. In 
this part of the voyage a melancholy event 
happened. Thursday fell suddenly ill; all 
the assistance that could be given hrm was 
of no service. You may imagine what Fri- 
day suffered, and what was his excess of 
Q-rief on the death of a father whom he 
loved !>eyond expression. The two lamas, 
also, being no longer able to endure the 
voyage and the sea air, died soon after. 

The ship arrived without any accident at 
Portsmouth. Robinson hoped to find there 
the widow to whom he was to restore the 
diamonds. He found her, indeed, according 
to the direction that he had received for her, 
but in very low circumstances. Having re- 
ceived neither remittancesnor even tidings 
from Indiafortwo years she and her children 



ROBINSON enusoE. 301 

were reduced to verygreat distress; in short, 
they were ahnost in rags, and poverty was 
painted in the countenance of each person 
of the family* Rohinson, therefore, once 
more experienced the satisfaction, so de- 
lightful to every man of benevolence, of 
being an instrument in the hands of Pro- 
vidence to dry up the tears of the unfortu- 
nate, and put an end to their distresses. He 
gave her the diamonds : and as a plant that 
is almost parched in sjtalk and branches re- 
covers its strength and verdure after a 
kindly and refreshing shower, he saw this 
family through returning plenty, and the 
satisfaction naturally accompanying it, lift 
up their heads once more, make a proper 
figure in society, and enjoy a happiness 
arising from independence which they had 
long since despaired of attaining. 

As Robinson found here a small vessel 
going to Plymouth immediately, he took 
leave of his captain, not chusing to go by 
land, and hastened with Friday aboard the 
Plymouth vessel, which set sail that same 
evening. 



5T[)2 THE NEW 

This sliort passage was soon performed. 
They were ahcady in sightof the Eddistone 
liglit-liOLise, wlien all of a sudden a violent 
storm arose, which carried the vessel to tlie 
westward. All that skill and activity coukl 
do was put in practice to tack and keep 
out to sea, hut to no purpose : a furious 
gust of wind rendered all their exertions 
useless; it forced the ship upon a sand- 
bank with such violence that she bulged. 

The water came pouring in so fast that 
they had iu)t a thought of saving her : in 
fact, the people had scarce time to take to 
their boats, which was the only resource 
they had to preserve their lives. 

They fortunately reached shore at a place 
not far from Plymouth. Robinson and the 
ship's crew immediately steered their course 
thither ; he, like a poor traveller, now twice 
shipwrecked, and saving, out of all his ef- 
fects, nothing but his faithful spaniel, who 
swam after the boat, and Poll, his parrot, 
which flewuponhisshoulderthemomentshe 
saw him leave th'e ship. He stopped in Ply- 
mouth that night, and the next day learned 



ROBINSON CRUaOE. 303 

tliat amongst the "goods saved from the 
M'reck, were his umbrella and suit of cloaths 
made of skins. These, being of no use to 
the finder, were restored to him by a fisher- 
man for a trifling gratuity. As to his great 
wedge of gold, it was lost irrecoverably. 

Rich. Poor Robinson ! 

Air. Bill. He is now exactly as rich as' 
when he formerly set sail from Plymouth. 
Perhaps Providence permitted this loss, to 
prevent any rash young person from being 
dazzled by Robinson's example, and tra- 
versing the world, like him, in the hope of 
returning with a treasure found by chance. 
As to Robinson, the loss gave him very 
little concern. Proposing, as he did, to live, 
all the rest of his days, as soberly, and with 
the same perseverance in labour, as he had 
whilst upon his island, he found a lump of 
gold to be quite unnecessary in the prose- 
cution of such a plan. 

He now took the coach for his native city 
Exeter. He had already learned at Ports- 
mouth that his mother was dead, that affec- 
tionate and tender mother, and he had bit- 



304- tHE NL-VV 

terly lamented her loss. Buried in melan- 
choly on account of this event, he attended 
very little to the accidents of the road, and 
passed through the towns of Brent, Ashbur- 
ton, and Chudieigh, without taking- the 
smallest notice of them. At length he stops 
in Exeter: his heart beating with joy, he 
springs out of the coach, and if it liad not 
been for the numbers of people in the street, 
whose presence somewhat abashed him, he 
M'ould have fallen on his face to kiss the 
ground of his native city. 

Going into the inn at which the carriage 
stopped, he chose to send to his father, in 
order to prepare him by degrees for the un- 
expected return of his son. The man who 
was charged with this messagehad orders to 
tell the old gentleman, at first, that a person 
desired to speak with him, who brought him 
agreeable news from his son : he was, after 
some time, to add, that his son was coming 
to Exeter; and, lastly, to declare that the 
bearer of these agreeable tidings was his son 
himself. Withoutthispreparation, the good 
old man might have been seizedwith such an 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 305 

excess of joy as would have cost him his 
life. 

After this precaution, Robinson, who still 
knew the streets perfectly well, flies to his 
father's house. As soon as he arrived there, 
in a transport of inexpressible extacy he 
throws himself into his father's arms, who 
trembled all over. ''Oh, my father!-' — ^'My 
i[learson!" — was all that they could say. 
Thro!)bing and speechless, they remained 
some time locked in each other's arms; at 
length a seasonable flood of tears relieved 
both their breasts, which were almost suf- 
focated with joy. 

Friday, whom the multitude of different 
objects that he saw filled with surprise, was 
staring about in silence. His eyes could 
never have enough. The first day he saw 
nothiiig, I may say : he was dazzled, con- 
founded, and could fix on no object. 

In the mean time, the noise of Robinson 
Crusoe's return and his surprising adven- 
tures was spread rapidly through the city 
of Exeter. He was the sole subject of con- 
versation, and every body crouded to see 



306' THE K»W 

him, every body desired to hear him re- 
late his adventures himself. His father's 
house was for ever full of people, and Ro- 
binson was employed in relating his story 
from morning to evening ; in the course of 
which he never forgot to address to the fa- 
thers and mothers whoheard him the follow- 
ing exhortation, '^Ifyou love your children, 
I pray you, teach them, in their early years, 
to be godly, sober, and laborious :*' and it' 
therehappened to be youngpersons present, 
be was careful to give them this wholesoiiie 
advice, ^'My dear children, obey your pa- 
rents and your teachers; learn diligently 
whatever you have a capacity to learn ; fear 
God, and be careful — oh, be careful to a void 
idleness ! it is the mother of every vice." 

Robinsons father was by profession a 
broker, and he wished to see his son apply 
to his own business, in order to take it up 
after his death ; but Robinson, long accus- 
tomed to the pleasure of manual labour, 
begged his permission to learn the trade of 
a carpenter, and his fvither not opposing his 
inclination, he put4>imself, together wit{>

which tlity made such proftciency, thatj 
before the end of the year, they could 
work with as much neatness and dispatch 
as any of the trade in Exeter. 

After sometime, tney opened the business 
in partnership, ana (iuring their whole lires 
remained faithful friends and inseparable 
companions. Industry and sobriety were so 
much a second nature to them, that they 
could not have j)asised even half a day in 
idleness or loose living. In remembrance of 
their formersolitary way of life, they pitch- 
ed upon one day in the week to live in the 
same manner as Ihey used in their island, 
as far as that could be done. Concord be* 
tween theilT%:elves, indulgemrefor the faults 
of others, beneficence^iowards those whom 
they knew, and humanity to ail men, were 
virtues so habitual to them, that they could 
not concGji^ how aoy one who neglected

were particularly ciistinguished by a pure, 
sincere, and active piety. Joy and love were 
seen to sparkle in their Gycs^ whenever the v

pronounced the name of the Supreme Be-

heard this sacred name uttered in vain and 
from mere levity. Therefore, the bless-

children continued sitting- some little time 
longer, in deep reflection, until this
