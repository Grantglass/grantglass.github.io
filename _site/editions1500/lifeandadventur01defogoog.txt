BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 



D4NIEL DEFOE. 



tB% author of Robiiison Crusoe would be entitled to a prominent plmce a 
the history of our literature, even had he never given to the wona thai 
truly admirable production ; and yet we may reasonably question whethei 
the name of Defoe would not long ago have sunk into obuvion, or at leait 
have b€«n known, like those of most of his contemporaries, only to the 
curious student, were it not attached to a work whose popularity has beer 
rarely equalled--never, perhaps, excelled. Even as it is, the reputatioi 
due to the writer has been nearly altogether absorbed in that of his hero, 
and in the all-engrossing interest of bis adventures : thousands who havs 
read Robinson Crusoe with delight, and derived from it a satisfaction in 
no wise diminished by repeated perusal, have never bestowed a thought on 
its author, or, indeed, regarded it in the light of a literary performance. 
While its fascination has been universally felt, the genius that conceived 
it, the talent that perfected it, have been generally overlooked, merely 
because it is so full of nature and reality as to exhibit no invention or 
exertion on the part of the author, inasmuch as he appears simply to have 
recorded what actually happened, and consequently only to have commit- 
ted to paper plain matter of fact, without study or embellishment. We 
wonder at and are struck with admiration by the powers uf Shakspeare or 
Cervantes ; with regard to Defoe we experience no similar feelings ; it is 
not the skill of the artist that enchants us, but the perfect naturalness 
of the picture, which is such that we mistake it for a mirror; so that every 
reader persuades himself that he could write as well, perhaps better, were 
he but furnished with the materials for an equallv interesting narrative. 

There are many circumstances in Defoe's own history that would recom- 
tAend it to ti^e notice of the biographer, independently of his claims as 
the author of Robinson : among which are the variety and extraordinary 
number of his literary performances, amounting to no fewer than two 
hundred and nine di£(erent publications; and the no less singular fact 
that the masterpiece of his genius was not only his first essay in that 
species of composition, but was not produced till he was far advanced in 
years, he having then arrived at a period of life when the generality^ of 
authors close their literary career, and when the powers of imagination 
either lose much o( their vigor, or become altogether torpid. Nor will 
our surprise at Defoe's indus^, and the almost unprecedented fertilitv ol 
his pen, be at all diminished by considerinff that he was not a recluse 
student or professed scholar, but was engaged in trade and various other 
speculations. In one respect, however, his mercantile occupations con- 
mbited to lay the foundatiop of l^s excellence as a novel-writer, naoi 



10 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH Or 

Kheie can be little doubt that it is to his actual experience of the sea, «iid 
hia acquaintance with other countrTes, we are indebted for that truth and 
•pirit which animate the more interesting parts of Robinson Crusoe 
while his manly good sense, unaffected earnestness, and fund <>f natiyt 
Intelligence, have placed him very far above those who presume to under- 
value his literary acquirements. 

According to the latest and most copious of all his bioeraphers, Daniel 
Defoe was bom in 1661, two years earlier than the seneraUy assigned date 
of his birth. His father wa« a butcher in the parisn of St. Giles, Cripple- 
nte ; and appears to have been a citizen in easy circumstances, although 
Eis trade was one that confers no particular lustre on a pedigree. It is 
usual to affect some d^ree of astonishment when we react of men whose 
after fame presents a striking contrast to the humili^ of their origin : yet 
we must recollect that it is not ancestrr and splendia descent, but educa- 
tion and circumstances which form the man; and in this respect the 
middling classes possess a decided advantage over those either below or 
above them : for if the former are precluded from cultivating their talents 
and abilities, the latter generally consider themselves exempt from the 
necessity of doing so, and accordingly content themselves with cultivating 
mere external accomplishments, in preference to exercising their mental 
energies. Those on the contrary who are placed in a middle station 
while they are not debarred from the means of appUeation, feel that 
stimulus to exertion which arises from the desire of acquiring fortune oi 
fame. The historr of such m^ as Ximenes, Wolsey, Alberoni, and 
Napoleon, ma^, indeed, justly excite our wonder ;— when, too, we behold 
unlettered gemus emerging, in spite of every obstacle, from the obscurity 
to which it seemed condemned, as in a Fergusson, a Duval, a Bums, ana 
an Opie, we may be permitted to express our astonishment ; but as regardr 
his origin, the history of Defoe is that of thousands who have afterwards 
raised themselves into comparative elevation b^ the display of theii 
powers. The solicitude, therefore, so generally displayed by biographers, 
on similar occasions, to trace some consan^^uinity with a more dignified 
branch of their families, for those whose native obscurity seems to demand 
some apology, betrays a rather mistaken policy. However this may be, 
it is certain that it is ouite as honorable for Defoe to have ascended from 
a butcher as it would have been to have descended from the Conqueror 
himself. 

One undoubted and very ffreat advantage, for which De'oe was indebted 
to his^ parents, who were Nonconformists, was an education superior to 
what it was then usual for persons in their station to bestow upon their 
ehildren; and they were careful also^to implant in his youthful mind that 
regard for religion, and that strict moral integrity, which Afterwards 
displayed themselves not only in his writings, but nis conduct through 
life. And this rectitude of pnnciple he most unequivocallv evinced when 
his misfortunes put it so severely to the proof. At about the uae of four- 
teen, he was placed under the tuition of the Rev. Charles Morton, of 
Newi^ton Green, who was afterwards vice-president of Harvard College. 
New ^gland ; and from various incidental remarks in his own works, it 
ippears that young Defoe now entered upon an extensive course of 
studies, and made considerable proficiency in languages, mathematiea, 
Lhilosophy, history, and theology ; although the naturu liveliness of his 
tispontion unfitted him for that severe application which is necessary ti 
form a profound scholar in any one of those pursuits. 

It was the intention of his parents that he should embrace the clerical 
profession, whicn their religious feelings, and probably a very purdonabl^ 
ambition, induced them to select for him : yet, notwithstanding his regari 
lor the sacred office, he was unwilling to embrace it himself; or events, a' 
^ast, diverted his talents into another channel. The political and 
I el gious excitements of that period were contagious for one of DetMe's 



DANIEL D£F0J!.. 1 , 

ftemper: ae astramed che character of the patriot as soon as he cut cil 
Ihat of the boy, and espoused the side of the popular party with all the 
ardor of youth ; nor was it long before he had opportunities of distinguish 
bag himself. He was a warm adTocate for the Bill of Exclusion, passed 
by the Commons to prevent the succession of the Duke of York to tha 
throne; and regarded with abhorrence that spirit of despotism which 
sentenced Sydney and so many others to the scaffold. At the age of twenty- 
one he commenced author, which employment he cuutinued for nearly 
half a century, and that, too, almost uninterruptedly, notwithstanding 
his Tarious speculations of a different nature. It cunnot be excected that 
in a sketch uf this nature we should attempt to give anything like a con- 
nected account of Defoe's various literary performances, they bein^ too 
numerous and multifarious for us to advert to them sepaiutelv, even if we 
conceiyed that by so doing we should greutly interest the reaaers of this '— 
the most distinguished of them all. But the truth is, the nuyority ol 
them sure of that class which it is rather the pruviui e of the bibliographer 
than the mtic to describe. We may, however, here mention the first 
production of his pen, which, under the singidar title of ** Speculum 
Crape-gownorum," was a renly to a publication of Ro^er L'Estrange's, b 
noted party writer of that oay. In this work Defoe mdulged in rathei 
intemperate langui^e, and while vindicating the dissenters, reflected in 
too hostile and indiscriminate a manner upon the established clergy 
This was succeeded by a ** Treatise against the Turks," occasioned by toe 
war between them and the Imperialists ; and was penned b^ Defoe for tha 
purpose of showing his countrymen that, if it was the mterest of Pro- 
testantism not to increase the influence of a Catholic power, it was 
infinitely more so to oppose a Mahommedan one ; which, however debate- 
able it might appear to politicians, was almost too obyious a truism to be 
entitled to any merit for its sagacity. It is the fate of political publica- 
tions quickly to fall into obliviitu after the events which call them forth 
have passed away : the reputation derived from them is as transitory ar 
the events themselves, or if the fame of the writer occasionally des^eo is 
to posterity, it is more than can be affirmed of his writings. 

Shortly after this, Defoe proved that he was as ready to support the 
doctrines he advocated by the sword as by the pen : he accordingly joined 
the standard of the Duke of Monmouth, when the latter landea m Eng- 
land wi^ the view of expelling a Catholic prince from the throne, and 
■eating himself upon it as the defender uf rrutestantism. The issue ol 
that adventure, and the subsequent fate of the unfortunate, if not per- 
fectly innocent, Monmouth are well known. Happiep than the leader of 
the enterprise, it was Defoe's better luck to escape : he returned to the 
metropolis in safety ; and, abandoning politics and warfare, was content 
for a while to turn his attention to the more humble but less storm > pur- 
suits of trade. 

He now became a hosier, or rather a hose-factor, that is, a kind of agent 
between the manufacturer and retailer ; and, according to Mr. Chalmers, 
he continued to carry on this concern from I680 to lo95. It was about 
two years after he had thus established himself, that he was admitted a 
liveryman of London, on the 26th of January, 1687-8. Business, how 
ever, did not sc entirely absorb his attention but that he found time to 
engage in the various controversies that agitated the public i.md, and 
which were occasioned by the arbitrary measures of James, who, feeling 
himself secure after the removal of- so dangerous an enemy as Monmouth, 
b^an more openly to favor the Catholics, and to dispense yrith the testa 
utended to prevent their accepting commissions in the army. This 0} 
course excited both the alarm and indignation of the Protestants, which 
were by no means al ayed by the temporizing servil^y of their own clergy, 
irho exerted their el: quence in favor of the king's prerogative. Among 
» who attai ked he doctrine of the dispensing power was Defoe ; nor 



12 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF 

ftd m&y w.'ll be imagined, was he afterwards an unct nceme i spectator o 
the Revclution. whose progress he had minutely watched, and whoM 
anniversary he continued yearly to celebrate as a day marked by th« 
deliverance of his country from political and religious tyranny. Hit 
attachment to the new sover^gn was confirmed by the nersonaf notice 
shown him IfOth by that prince and his consort ; for the " Imtcher's son *' 
had the honor of an early introduction to the royal presence. 

At this period Defoe resided at Tooting in Surrey, and he had now 
launched out into more extensiTe commercial speculations, having embarked 
In the Spanish and Portuguese trade, so that he might fairly claim the 
title of merchant. The precise time of his ^oing to Spain, whether before 
or after the Reyoliition, cannot be ascertained; but he not only made t 
▼oyage thither, but stayed some time in the country, and acquired a 
knowledge of the langua^. Sincere as was his attachment to the purei 
tenets of Protestantism, it did not degenerate into blind prejudice, noi 
prevent him from doing justice to Catholics: he has accordingly, in 
his Robinson Crusoe, represented the Spanish character under its most 
amiable traits, and in a tone that may almost pass fur panegyric. This 
voyage, as we have already remarked, doubtlesslv contributed to store his 
observant mind with many materials for thoiie aesoriptious of the perils 
and adventures common to a seafaring life, that so strongly excite the 
sympathy of those who follow his hero across the trackless deep. Nor 
was he without some experience of shipwreck, if not actually in nis own 
person, by the loss of a vessel in which he was a shareholder, and which 
was wrecked in a violent storm off the coast of Biscay. It was about thii 
period also that he traded with Holland ; probably for civet, as one of his 
enemies has sneeringly styled him a ** civet-cat merchant." Besides this 
he visited some other parts of the continent, particularly Germany : he 
did not, however, relinquish his hose-agency business in consequence of 
his other engagements. But commercial enterprise did not prove for him 
the road to wealth : on the contrary, his speculations involveoi him in such 
embarrassments, that, in 1^92, he was obliged to abscond from his creditors. 
V commission of uankruptcy was taken out against him, yet it was after- 
wards superseded, those to whom he was most in debt agreeing to accept 
a composition on his own bond ; and he not only punctually discharged 
these claims, but, after he had somewhat retrieved his circumstances, 
▼oluntarily repaid the remainder. This is so much the more to his honor, 
since so far n-ora having met with many precedents of similar probity in 
others, his misfortunes had been in some degree occasioned by the knavery 
cf unprincipled men, who, availing themselves of the impunity held out 
to them by the supineness or the impotency of the law, were then accus- 
tomed to set their creditors at defiance in the most barefaced manner. 

It was Defoe himself who first called the attention of the legislature tc 
the intolerable abuses which arose from those satictuaries, as they were 
termed, for criminals and debtors, which then existed in the metropolis ; 
and to him, conse<}uently, may we be said to be indebted for the abatement 
of a nuisance as disgraceful to the national character, as it was injurious 
to the industrious and honest portion of the community. 

With a view of assisting him in his distress, some of his friends now 
came forward and offered to settle him as a factor at Cadi2 : yet, advanta- 
geous as the proposal was, he declined it, preferring to endeavor to retrieve 
bis finances by his pen. The country being then engaged in an expensive 
war with France, Defoe proposed a scheme to assist the goyemmeut in 
raising *'the ways and means;" and some time afterwards he received 
the appointment of accounUnt to the commissioners of the ^lass duly : 
but it proved only a temporary one, as the duty was repealed in Angus c 
1099. Probably it wa»also about the same period that he became secretary 
to the tile-works at Tilbury, in which concern he em^wrked some money 
sniwas again a sufferer. His/' Essay on Projects," published in Jan 



DANIEL DEFOfc. H 

CMiy, 16M-7, shows him 1o have been, if not a very successful speculatoi 
himself, at least a very ingenious and fertile deviser of theoretical plans, 
moEt of which must be allowed to have the welfare of society in view ; noi 
have they been without influence in leading to many improvements ol 
later times : among those which have been practically adopted, we xaaj 
mention his scheme for Friendly Societies and Savings Banks. Wers 
any testimony required in favor of this work, it would be sufhcent td 

2u(»te that of the celebrated Franklin, whu confesses that the impressions 
e received from it gave a stronjj bias to his own pursuits. 

If not invariably employed m the active defence of public cctall, 
Defoe's pen was too honest to betray their interests on any occasion : it 
was not always that his topics callea for. or even admitted, any direct 
Inculcations of virtue, but whenever they did, he displayed his earnestness 
in its behalf. His publication entitled ** The Poor Man's Plea " is a very 
keen piece of satire, with a considerable touch of humor, levelled against 
the vices of the upper classes of societ^r, in which he uracs them to dW- 
countenance by their own conduct the immorality they aeem so reprehen- 
sible in the vulgar. The stage too did not escape his castigatiou ; and 
really its transgressions were at that period so barefaced and audacious, so 
offensive even to commoi^decency, that, whatever infamy there may have 
been in either tolerating or in attempting to defend such a system o^ 
lewdness, there could be no great triumph m exposing that which did not 
even attempt to conceal itself. 

We have now to notice our author in a somewhat different character—- 
namely, as a candidate for poetical fame. His satire, entitled the '* True 
bom Englishman,'* which was written for the purpose of averting from 
the king the abusive reflections cast upon him as a foreigner, had indeed a 
▼er}* great run at the time — more, nowever, on account of the mattei 
than of the manner — since both that and all Defoe's other attempts ot 
the kind convince us, that, like the great Roman orator, he was an intol- 
erably bad poet, and not even a decent versifier. Yet could gratitude and 
enthusiastic devotion to his prince have supplied the inspiration which 
ihe muses denied him, Defoe's poetry would have been of first-rate excei 
lence, so sincere was his admiration of, so zealous was his devotion to, 
William III. The various effusions in rhyme, and the numerous political 
pamphlets and tracts which he published at this interval, we must pass by 
and come directly to an event that obtained for our author a rathex 
unenviable species of distinction. The reign of Anne commenced with 
much violence and with cabals between the respective church parties, 
leading to controversies that rather fanned than allayed the public fer- 
ment. On such an occasion, it wus not tu be expected that Defoe would 
remain passive : assuming the furious tone of the high-churchmen of the 
day against the dissenters, he published a small pamphlet, which was in 
reality a satire upon the writings which tl.at party had issued from the 
press; but the irony was so fine, and the imitation so exact, that v^hWe it' 
was supposed by them to utter the real sentiments of the writer, it wa^ 
alto interpreted by those whom it was intended to serve as coming from u 
▼iplent epemy. The "Shortest Way with the Dissenters " —such was it« 
tiUe^crcat«^I an amazing sensation ; and on its real object being exposed 
thf> high-church party became as fierce in their indignation, as they hnc 
before been warm in their applause. The author was detected, a reward 
offered for his apprehension, and he himself sentenced to be imprisoned iit 
Newgate, wad to stand in the pillory ; but the attendance of nis friends, 
and the em husiasm of the populace in favor of the champion of ttligioui> 
liberty, coi. verted an ignominious punishment into a triumph, so that his 
enemies ha 1 as little reason to exult in their victory, as to be proud of th( 
lagacity they had displayed. If, however, this event rather increased 
than diminished Defoe's reputation, it had a different effect upon hit 
pecuniary affairs: his confinement in Newgate prevented Ins atteudin^ 
2 



14 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF 

my longer to his concern at Tilbury, the consequence f which was thmt 
It was obliged to be given up ; and thus Defoe saw h mself depriycd al 
Ince of what hud been the source of a handsome income, for before ^i 
affair he was in such thriving circumstances as to be able to kecj his 
eoach. According to his own statement, he lost three thousand five 
hundred pounds, afar more considerable sum at that period than ic w uld 
De now. There was indeed one way of both speedily and safely repairing hia 
finances, namelv, by accepting the overtures made him by the ministry 
who would gladly nave enlisted in their own cause that pen which had 
pro?ed so powerful against them : but Defoe was too independent of sduI. 
and too high-principled, to purchase his release upon terms that wcula 
inflict upon him the disgrace the pillory had failed to effect. 

Although a ^riaon is not the most congenial place for literary ]>uranitt. 
nor antiior availed himself of the time which the loss of his liber^ affordea 
him, of occupying his unwelcome leisure from all other business m writing 
both in verae and prose. It was here that he published his poem on the 
''Reformation of Manners,*' a sufficiently copious theme in every age, 
and afterwards continued the subject in another, entitled **MoreRerorma« 
tion ; " in which he alludes to his own situation in the following nervoui 
Juea, ("eacribing himself as

Here we may truly say facU indigfuUio therms, for the caustic tone and 
antithesis are not unworthy of Pope himself. The political controversial 
pieces which he sent forth to the world from his " place of durance vile " 
were too numerous for us to specify them : we therefore prefer speaking 
of a work of more permanent interest, one in which he may be rep^arded 
as the imniediate predecessor of two of the most popular and admired oi 
our classic writers in the days of Anne— namely, Steele and Addison. 
Defoe's " Review," which commenced Feb. 19, 1704, deserves to be 
considered as the prototype of our Tatlera and Spectators ; and may earn 
for its author the appellation of the Father of English Essayists : since 
notwithstanding that political inteUigence and discussion constituted a 
great portion of its contents, it touched upon a variety of other topics 
bearing npon literature, manners, and morals ; while it was itself hardly 
in any degree indebted for this part of its plan to proceeding or contem- 
porary publications. Uniformily assailing vice, or exposing to just ridicule 
the follies and foibles of society, Defoe varied his mode of attack, at oue 
time employing grave reasoning and serious remonstrance; at another, 
substituting sarcasm, humor, wit, and pleasantry, for monitory reproof 
To a modem reader, indeed, many of the topics might seem to lack 
oivention, and to be rather common-place, merely because they have been 
•o repeatedly handled by later writers, that both the wit ana argument 
displayed in them have lost their freshness. This circumstance, howevei i 
does not detract from Defoe's intrinsic merit, or from the praise due to 
him as an originator : on the contrary, he, in this respect, only shares the 
fute common to all those who open a new path in literature or art, inviting 
(mitatois whose numbers oppress, if they do not overwhelm them : thai

tfian we can venture to assert; yet it should be recollected tha^ it is the 
Irat navigator of the Atlantic, not those who cross it in a modem steam* 
boat, who claims the homage of our admiration.

|OiPiiB, and the ranety of his information. But we lave ali^ady iirel 
l^pon tl>.e " Keview *' at ^eater length than is consistent with the brevity 
we must perforce obseive: it is time, therefore, to proceed with oui car* 
ralive. Mr. Harley, afterwards earl of Oxford, happened, by a change in 
the ministry, to come into power, after Defoe had been about two years in 
oiafinement, and being able to appreciate his abilities — perhajs anxious 
to secure them in his own support, he represented his case to the queen, 
wHo generously sent a sum of money to his wife and family, ai i another 
to discharge his fine and prison expenses. Immediately upon his libera- 
tion, Defoe retired to Bury St. Edmund's. It was there that he wrote his 
ouuiterly treatise, entitled ** Oiving Alms no Charity," in which Le displays 
great practical knowledge, with enlarged and sound Tiews on the causes ol 
puTertY, and on the employment of the poor. In the intenrals of these 
and other occupations, for it should be obserred that he had been sent in 
1705 bv Harley on a secret mission to the continent, the express object oi 
which nas not transpired, — he found leisure to employ his pen on other 
subjects, and anticipating his future character of a romance writer, he 
invented the " true narrative " of Mrs. Veal's apparition, which was pre- 
fixed to \ translation of Drelincourt on Death. The supposed stranger 
from the other world is made to recommend that performance ; and, as 
■uch supernatural testimony was irresistible, the whole impression, which 
had betore lain on the bookseller's shelves, was quickly sold, and was 
succeeded bj many others, the work having since passed through forty 
different editions. This stratagem certainly does honor to Detoe's in- 
genuity and penetratkn ; yet whether it be entirely justifiable, considering 
the tendency of the deception, may be doubted. 

Leaving for a while the account of his literary career, we must now 
briefly notice a very important national subject, namely, the Union with 
Scotland, in which, besides warmly advocating the measure with his pen. 
Defoe was personally emploved. At the recommendation of Harley ana 
Lord Godolphin, by whom he had been recommended to the queen, he 
was sent on a mission to Edinburgh, in which city he arrived in October, 
)706. Here, it should seem, he wa»<:hiefiy employed in making calcula* 
tions relating to trade and taxes, for the information of the committees ol' 
parliament ; ne also occupied himself in collecting those documents rela- 
tive to the Union which he afterwards published. Besides this, he 
proi>osed several plans for encouraging the manufactures, and for pro- 
moting the trade, wealth, and maritime resources of Scotland. After an 
absence of about sixteen monthA, he returned to England in 1708, when 
his services obtained for him, from the ministry, an appointment with a 
Axed salary ; and as it does not appear what was the nature of the office 
he held, we may conclude it to have been merelv a sinecure. Almost 
hnmediately afterwards, his patron Harley was dismissed from office, 
through the persevering intrigues of the duchess of Marlborough, 
whom he had supplanted in the queen's favor, an event that suddenly 
tverclonded Defoe's political prospects. Without compromising hii 
brineiples, however, he espoused the interest of tiie succeeolng ministrjr; 
out although Godolphin treated him with consideration, he suffered wb 
pension to fall into arrears, perhaps in consequence of Defoe's long 
abeence in Scotland, whither he was again despatched a few months after- 
wirdsj upon some secret business. In the following year, 1709, Defoe 
publishea a work which, to use the words of an eminent living critic, 
*' placet him amongst Ike soundest historians of the day;" and which, 
aooordin^ to the testimony of another, would have handed down his name 
<o posterity, even had he not immortalized himself b^ Robinson Crusoe. 
This was his ** History of the Union," which is as intere«-ting for ths 
idnute descriptione it gives of the actors and incidents in that important 
tfcnt, as for the documents it furnishes. 

f liU enga^i in politics, Defoe's continued and tevera attacks againib 



le BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH Or 

Ihe Toiies and high-chorch party so exasperated them, that they attempiM 
to suppress his vrri tings, and even threatened him with prosecutions' 
their animosity, however, did not procure for him, from those whose caas« 
he defended, a degree of favor and support at all commensurate with hifl 
long and able services. He had alsc to contend with fresh pecuniary 
losses in some concern in which he was engaged (1712) with Mr. Wood, a 
mercer of ColeshiU in Warwickshire, and with the personal abuse with 
which his character was assailed by writers who reflected upon him at 
being a knavish bankruot. But his political career was now drawing to 
its close: havins carried on his ** Review " for more than nine jeart, he 
finally relinquished it in May, 1713, when he was again a prisoner ia 
Newgate upon an indictment preferred against him by his friends the 
Whigs, as tne author of three treasonable Jacobitical pamphlets ; whereas 
the publications in question were of a directly opposite tendency. The 
queen once more bestowed a free pardon on him, and the malice of hii 
numerous enemies was defeated. From this time he employed his pen 
only occasionally on political subjects. By the accession of G^rge I. to 
the throne, Defoe gained nothing, althougn his writings had strenuously 
pleaded the cause of the House of Hanover during the late reign ; and 
although he had superior claims upon public gratitude for the seal with 
which, during nearly thirty years, he had not only advocated religious and 
political independence, but endeavored to call attention to subjects of 
paramount importance to the national prosperity. That this neglect * 
should, in spite of all his philosophy, have occasioned him considerable 
mortification, is not much to be wondered at ; and to the efiect it had 
upon his health was attributed an apoplectic attack in the year 1715, from 
which he continued to suffer for six months. 

After so serious a blow to his constitution, and at his advanced period 
of life, it mi^ht have been expected that he would now lay aside his pen,— 
at least remit in his exertions. Yet it was subsequently to this apparently 
cloudy epoch of his career that the brightest and most durable of his 
literary wreaths was won. Great versatility of talent is not often ^coom- 
paniea by an equal degree of vigor and rariness of intellect : when, how- 
ever, such does happen to be the case, it should seem that the former is 
rather beneficial than otherwise to its possessor, and that change of sub- 
ject serves to recruit the mental energies. Defoe at least may he (quoted 
as an extraordinary instance of r^venescency of mind in the decUne oi 
years. We do not here allude to his " Family Instructor," although that 
perfom^nce is one of the most valuable and useful systems of practical 
morality in our language, and has, doubtless, been far more beneficial to 
society than many works of even splendid celebrity. It is the series of 
novels which now appear in quick succession from nis pen, that have won 
for him an imperishable reputation among the worthies of English litera- 
ture : nor will nis claims upon our admiration be diminished by considering 
the extravagant, unnaturai system of romauce-wriung which had till then 
prevailed, where everything was either so artificial or so shadowy, that 
net a glimpse of real life was to be discerned. In Defoe's narratives, oii 
the contrary, there is such an air of downright matter'Of-fact and un 
•domed truth, as to amount to actual deception; thereby preventing^ tt» 
from cr'tditing t.ie author with any merit on the score of imagination 
eontrivance, or invention. Of this the reader will be amply convinced b^ 
the perusal of tbe present work, on which it is not necessary that we 
should expati'ite, and we shall therefore mereff advert to the circum- 
stances conni ottd with its origin and publication. The history of Robinson 
Crusoe w.irs H si published in the year 1719, and its popularity may b» 
said to h ive lieen established immediately, since four eoitions were called 
for in !\t>uut at) many months, a circumstance at that time jedmost unpie* 
eedented in the annals of literature. It rarely happens that an author*! 
•I^p9pt»tic«i »rf surpassed by the success of his work, howover astonishini 



DAJJIEL DEFOB. H 

$ maj seem tc others : yet periiaps eTen Defoe himself did not ^eitnre tc 
took forward id such a welcome on the part of the public, after the repul- 
ses he had experienced on that of the booksellers ; for incredible us it now 
appears, the manoscript of the work had been offered to, and rejected by, 
every one in the trade, in which respect its destiny was not only similar ta 
that of Paradise Lost, but two of the most celebrated literanr productions ol 
the present day, namely, Waverly and Childe Harold ; the former of which 
remained in manoscript ten years, without any probability of ever seeing 
the light, although its fame nas since extended itself whererer the Eng- 
lish language is known— na} more, has even penetrated the wilds ol 
Siberia. 

Astonishing as was the success of Defoe's romance, it did not deter the 
envious from attempting to disparage it. The materials, it was said, were 
either furnished by, or surreptitiously obtained from, Alexander Selkirk, 
1 mariner who had resided for four years in the desert island of Juan 
Feruandes, and returned to England in 1711. Very probably, his story, 
which then excited considerable interest and attention, did suggest to 
Defoe the idea of writing his romance ; but all the details and incidents 
are entirely his own. Most certainly Defoe had obtained no papers oi 
written documents from Selkirk, as the latter had none to communicate. 
So far, however, have others been from taxing our author with plagiarism, 
that they have, on the contrary, charged him with putting on paper a 
heap of chimeras, to impose upon public credulity. Thus these two 
contradictory charges reciprocally destroy each other. An attempt has 
also been made to rob him entirely of the brightest jewel in his literary 
crown, by denying him to have been the author of Robinson Crusoe, 
which has been ascribed, by some, to Arbuthnot ; bv others, to Defoe's 
patron, the first earl of Oxford. Those who have wisned to gain credit 
for the Utter opinion, assert that it was composed by that nobleman 
during his imprisonment in the Tower, in 171o, on a charge of high 
treason ; and tney have ui^ed that the whole tone of the work, especially 
if that part towards the conclusion where an account is given of the 
exiled nobles of Muscovy, is what would naturally be suggested by the 
solitude of a prison. Yet as far as internal evidence is concerned, that is, 
indisputably, much stronger in favor of Defoe ; for he had not onlv been 
famihar with imprisonment, but was also by his acquaintance with foreign 
countries, and his experience in business and traffic, much better qualified 
to produce a work which displays so much practical knowledge of things, 
as well as of man. Indeed, nothing short of the most conclusive and 
undeniable testimony of facts to the contrary can at all invalidate his 
claims to be considered as the real author. Had Robinson Crusoe been 
the only production of the kind that proceeded froqk his pen, there might 
be better reason for doubting whether he wrote it ; but the various othet 
novels, or rather pieces of fictitious biography, which he produced, form 
%n additional reason for attributing it to him. 

Of these latter we must here speak far more briefly than they deserve r 
the ** History of Moll Flanders,** which was published in 1721, is an 
admirably drawn picture of life, and contains an excellent moral lesson, 
although many of tiie scenes it necessarily discloses are coarse and revolt- 
ing. The **Life of Colonel Jaqne" contains almost as much able 
ieuneation of real life ; and in that part of the narrative which sives an 
account of the hero's residence in Virginia, Defoe has humanely advocated 
the cause of the negro slaves. His "Memoirs of a Cavaker," which 
work is supposed to have been written about the same time, is rather 
History attired in the form of an imaginary piece of biography, than a 
Kxnance. Indeed, all the details are so circumstantial and accurate, that 
t has been mistaken for a genuine narrative of the events of the civil 
wars in England and Germany ; and it was actually recommended as the 
•ry best account of them by the great Lord Chatham, with whom it wai

% fiiToiite book. In like manner onr author's ** History of the Plague * 
impcised upon Dr. Mead, and since upon others, who hare referred to it as 
an authentic documentj^and a true recital of that great national calamity. 
Here he is the riral of Thucydides and Boccaccio^ and depicts the horrors 
of pestilence as Tividly and as masterly as Poussin. It may, however, be 
imu^ed by some that this is rather suspicious praise, and that the work 
of fietion which can pass as true histonr must b« cold, matter-of-fact, and 
tame — repulsive and dry. It is not, however, iu the formal gravity of 
style that these works resemble history ; but they imitate and reflect the 
features of the past in their most interesting, if not their most engaging 
aspect. 

Besides the preceding, and one or two other productions of a similac 
east, Defoe produced that very excellent and popular work entitled 
" Religious Courtship," which was first published m 1722, and afterwards 
went through numerous editions. This and his " Family Instructor " tr« 
replete with lessons of the soundest practical wisdom, and place tiMif 
author among the most extensively useful of our English moralists. 

Here, however, we must terminate our sketch, having barely left otjt- 
selves room to mention a few particulars relative to the close of his life. 
Although the profits accruing from his publications had of late beoi 
considerable, and he had been able to give a portion to his daughter 
Boi^ia, who married Mr. Baker, the celebrated natural philosopher, in 
1729, yet he was still doomed to contend with misfortune. In admtion ia 
the afriction of bodily infirmity and severe pain, he again fell into great 
pecuniary difficulties, and was even arrested. He appears, however, to 
Lave recovered his liberty within a short time ; but the unnatural conduct 
of his son, who refused to g^ve up the property that had been entrusted to 
him, with the view of securing a provision to his mother and two unmar- 
ried sisters, was a heavier blow than any he had before exp^ieneed ; and 
the mental anguish it occasioned doubtless accelerated his death, which 
ocoured on the 24th of April, 1781. Since that period more than a century 
has elapsed ; and in that interval many names of considerable eminence 
hi their day have sunk into irretrievable oblivion ; Defoe, jilso, has lost 
some portion of the celebrity he enjoyed with his contemporaries : yet, 
after oeduction, enouffh remains to entitle him to a place among tlM 
Worthies of Bnslish nteratore, for should all his other productioas be 
tngotten, his Robiiison Crusoe must remain imperishable. 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 



SECTION 1. 

EOBINSON'S family, etc. ^ his BLOPBMBNT FBOM his PABBin* 

1 WAS bom in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a gocd 
femily, though not of that country, my father being a foreignei 
of Bremen, named Kreutznaer, who settled first at Hull. 
He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving off hii 
trade, lived afterwards at York ; from whence he had mar- 
ried my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a 
fery good family in that country, and after whom I was so 
called, that is to say, Robinson Kreutznaer ; but by the 
usual corruption of words in England, we are now called, 
nay, we call ourselves, and write our name, Crusoe ; and so 
my companions always called me. 

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant- 
colonel, to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly 
commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed 
at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What 
became of my second brother, 1 never knew, any more than 
my father and mother did know what was become of me. 

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to an^ 
trade, my head began to be filled very early with rambling 
iboughts. My father, who was very aged, had given me 
ft competent share of learning, as far as house education 
and a country free school generally go, and designed me foi 
the law ; but I i^ould be satisfied with nothing but goin^ to 



£0 ADVENTURES OF 

lea ; and my inclination to this led me so stn ugly againt 
the will, nay, the commands of my father, and against aL 
the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and othei 
friends, that there seemed to he something fatal in thai 
propenaion of nature, tending directly to the life of misery 
whi^h was to befall me. 

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and 
9XceUent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. 
He called me one morning into his chamber, where he was 
x>nfined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with 
me upon this subject : he asked me what reasons, more than 
i mere wandering inclination, 1 had for leaving his house, 
and my native country, where I might be well introduced, 
and had a prospect of raising my fortune, by application 
and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me 
it was men of desperate fortunes, on one hand, or of superior ' 
fortunes, on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, 
aspiring to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous 
in undertakings of a nature out of the common road ; that 
these things were all either too far above me, or too far 
below me ; that mine was the middle state, or what might 
be called the upper station of low life, which he had found, 
by long experience, was the best state in the world, the 
most suited to human happiness ; not exposed to the mis' 
eries and hardships, the labor and sufferings, of the mechanic 
part of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, 
ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind : he toM 
me, I might judge of the happiness of this state by one thing, 
riz., that this was the state of life which all other people 
envied ; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable 
consequences of being bom to great things, and wished they 
had been placed in the middle of two extremes, between the 
mean and the great ; that the wise man gave his testimony 
ro this af the just standard of true felicity, when he prayed 
to hav 5 " neither poverty nor riches.*' 



ROBINSON CRUSOK. 2l 

He bade me oliserve it, aHd 1 should always find, tha the 
ealamities of life were shared among the upper and lowei 
part of mankind ; but that the middle station had the fewest 
disasters, and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes aa 
the higher or lower part of mankind : nay, they were not 
subjected to sd many distempers and uneasinesses, either ol 
body or mind, as those were, who, by vicious living, luxury, 
and extravagancies, on one hand, or by hard labor, want cl 
necessaries, and mean and insufficient diet, on the othei 
Land, bring distempers upon themselves by the natural con- 
sequences of their way of living that the middle station ol 
life was calculated for all kind of virtues, and all kind o! 
enjoyments ; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a 
middle fortune ; that temperance, moderation, quietness, 
health, society, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable 
pleasures were the blessings attending the middle station oJ 
life ; that this way men went silently and smoothly through 
the world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with 
the labors of the hands or of the head, not sold to the life ol 
slavery for daily bread, or harassed with perplexed circum- 
stances, which rob the soul of peace, and the body of rest , 
not enraged with the passion of envy, or secret burning lust 
of ambition for great things ; but, in easy circumstances, 
sliding gently through the world, and sensibly tasting thr 
sweets of living, without the bitter ; feeling that they are 
happy, and learning by every day's experience, to know it 
more sensibly. 

After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affec- 
tionate mstfuier, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate 
myself into miseries which nature and the station of life I 
was bom in, seemed to have provided against ; that I was 
under no necessity of seeking my bread ; that he would do 
*7ell fcr me, and endeavor to enter me fairly into the station 
»f life which he had been just recommending to me ; and 
tnat if I was not very e& iy and happy in the world, it must 



12 Ai) VENTURES ur 

be my me^ Ikte, or fault, that must hinder it ; and (hat ht 
■hould have nothing to answer for, having thus diboharged 
hb duty in warning me against measures whioh ne kneii 
would he to my hurt : in a word, that as he would do ver^ 
kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home, as he di« 
rected ; so he would not have so much hand in my misfoitunej 
M to give me any encouragement to go away : and, to close 
all, he told me I had my elder brother for an example, to 
whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him 
from going into the Low Country wars ; but could not pre* 
vail, his young desires prompting him to run into the army, 
where he was killed; and though, he said, he would not 
cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, 
that if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me ; 
and I would have leisure, hereafter, to reflect upon having 
neglected his counsel, when there might be none to assist in 
my recovery. 

I observed, in the last part of his discourse, which was 
truly prophetic though, I suppose, my father did not know 
« to be so himself ; I say, I observed the tears run down hv 
Hce very plentifully, especially when he spoke of my brother 
rho was killed ; and that, when he spoke of my having 
eisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved 
diat he broke off the discourse, and told me his heart was so 
full, he could say no more to me. 

I was si^cerely affected with this discourse, as indeed who 
could be otherwise? and I resolved not to think of going 
abroad any more, but to settle at home, according to my 
fiither's desire. But, alas ! a few days wore it £^ off ; and, 
in short, to prevent any of my father's farther importunities, 
m a few weeks after, I resolved to run quite away from him. 
However, I did not act so hastily neither, as my first heat ol 
resolution prompted, but I took my mother at a time when 
i thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary, and told her 
^t ray thoughts were 60 entirely bent upon seeing the world 



ROBINSON CRUSOJi. 2!| 

tl^t I should never settle to anything with resolution enough 
to go through with it, and my father had better give me hi» 
e(«usent, than force me to go without it; that I was bow 
eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a 
trade, or clerk to an attorney ; that I was sure, if I did, 1 
should never serve out my time, and I should certainly run 
iway from my master before my time was out, and go to sea ; 
and if she would speak to my father to let me make but one 
Toyage abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, 1 
would go no more, and I would promise, by a double dili- 
gence, to recover the time I had lost. 

This put my mother into a great passion : she told me, 
ihe knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father 
upon any such a subject ; that he knew too well what was 
my interest, to give his consent to anything so much for mv 
hurt ; and that sL^ wondered how I could think of any such 
thing, after the discourse I had had with my father, and such 
kind and tender expressions, as she knew my father had used 
to me ; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was 
no help for me ; but I might depend I should never have 
their consent to it : that, for her part, she would not have so 
much hand in my destruction ; aud I should never have it to 
say, that my mother was willing v ^en my father was not. 

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I 
heard afterwards, that she reported aU the discourse to him ; 
and that my father, after showing a gpreat concern at it, said 
to her, with a sigh, " That boy might be happy, if he would 
stay at home ; but if he goes abroad, he will be the most 
miserable wreteh that ever was bom : I can give no consent 
to it" 

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, 
ihough in the mean time I continued obstinately deaf to ^1 
proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostalating 
with my father and mother about their being so positively 
determined against what they knew my inclinations prcmpted

and without any purpose of making an elopement at thai 
time, and one of my companions then going to London hj 
sea in his father*8 ship, and prompting me to go with then: 
by the common allurement of seafaring men, viz., that it 
should cost me nothing for my passage, I consulted neither 
father nor mother any more, nor so much as sent them word 
of it ; but left them to hear of it as they ndght, without 
asking God's blessing, or my &ther*s, without any consider-

God knows. 



SECTION II. 

VIBST ▲DTBKTXTBaS AT SEA, AND BXPBBIBNCB OP A MaBITIMB LIFV— 
YOTAOB TO GUINEA. 

On the 1st of September, 1651, I went on board a ship 
bound for London. Never any young adventurer's misfor- 
tunes, I believe, began younger, or continued longer than 
mine. The ship had no sooner got out of the Humber, 
than the wind began to blow, and the waves to rise, in a 
most frightful manner ; and as I had never been at sea 
before, I was most inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified 
in mind : I began now seriously to reflect upon what I hod 
done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of 
Heaven, for wickedly leaving my father's house. All the 
good counsels of my parents, my father's tears, and my 
m€)ther*s entreaties, came now fresh into my mind ; and my 
conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of hardnesi 
to which it has been since, reproached me mth the contempt 
«f tdvice, and the abandonment of my duty. 



HOBlNvSON CRUSOK. 2* 

411 this while the stonn increased, and the sea, which 1 
kdd never been upon before, went very high, though nothing 
like what I have seen many times since ; no, nor what I sa\% 
a few days after ; but, such as it was, enough to alfect me 
then, who was but a young sailor, and had never known any 
thing of the matter. I expected every wave would have 
swallowed us up, and that every time the shi^ fell down, ae 
( thought, into the trough or hollow of the sea, we should 
never rise more ; and in this agony of mind I made many 
\ows and resolutions, that^if it would please God to spare 
my life this voyage, if ever I got my foot once on dry land, 
I would go directly home to my father, and never set il 
into a ship again, while I lived ; that I would take his advice, 
and never run myself into such miseries as these any more* 
Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observations about 
the middle station of life ; how easy, how comfortable, 
he had lived all his days, and never had been exposed to 
tempests at sea or troubles on shore ; and I resolved that I 
would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my father. 

These wise and sober thoughts continued during the 
storm, and indeed some time after ; but the next day, as the 
wind was abated, and the sea calmer, I began to be a litUe 
inured to it. However, I was very grave that day, being 
also a little sea-sick still : but towards night the weather 
cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming fine 
evening followed ; the sun went down perfectly clear, and 
rose so the next morning ; and having little or no wind, 
and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sigbt was, as 
I thonght, the most delightful that I ever saw. 

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea- 
sick, but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea

ftud said. Well, Bob, clapping me on the siouider, how d« 
you do after it ? I warrant you you were frightened, wa*n'l 
foo, last night, when it blew but a cap-full of wind ? — A 
eap-full, do you call it ? said I ; 'twas a terrible storm. — 
A storm, you fool ! replies he, do you call that a storm ? 
Why, it was nothing at all ; give us but a good ship, and 
sea -room, and ^e th^nk nothing of such a squall of wind as 
Uiat : yo 1 are but a fresh-water sailor. Bob ; ccme, let us 
jdake a bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that. D'ye see 
what charming weather 'tis now ? To make short this sad 
part of my story, we went the way of all sailors ; the punch 
was made, and I was made drunk with it ; and in that one 
night's wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my 
reflections upon my past conduct, and all my resolutions fox 
the future. In a word, as the sea was returned to its 
smoothness of surfrice and settled calmness by the abate- 
ment of the storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, 
my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the 
•ea forgotten, and the current of my former desires 
returned, I entirely forgot the tows and promises 1 had 
made in my distress. I found, indeed, some intervals of 
reflection ; and serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavor to 
return again sometimes ; but I shook them off and roused 
myself from them, as it were from a distemper, and, apply- 
ing myself to drink and company, soon mastered the return 
of those fits — for so I called them ; and had in five or six 
days got as complete a victory over conscience as any young 
sinner, that resolved not to be troubled with it, could desire. 
But I was to have another trial for it still ; and Providence, 
as in such ca«es generally it does, resolved to leave ma 
entirely without excuse : for if I would not take this for a 
deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and 
most hardened wretch among us would confess l)oth> the 
danger and the mercy of. The sixth day of our being at 
tea we caine into* Yarmouth Roads ; the wind having bees

fontrar) and the weather calm, we had made but little ^ay 
tince the storm. Here we were obliged to come to an 
anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, viz.^ 
at south-west, for seven or eight days, during which time a 
great many ships from Newcastle came into the same roads, 
as the common harbor where the ships might wait for a wind 
fcf the river Thames. We had not, however, rid here so 
long, but we should have tided up the river, but that the 
wind blew too fresh ; and, after we had lain four or five 
days, blew very hard. However, the roads being reckoned 
as good as a harbor, the anchorage good, and our ground 
tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and not in 
the least apprehensive of danger, but spent the time in rest 
and mirth, after the manner of the sea. But the eighth day, 
in the morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands at 
work to strike our topmasts, and make everything snug and 
close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon 
the sea went very high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle 
in, shipped several seas, and we thought, once or twice, oiir 
anchor had come home ; upon which our master ordered out 
the sheet anchor ; so that we rode with two anchors ahead, 
and the cables veered out to the better end. 

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed ; and now I 
began to see terror and amazement in the faces of even the 
seamen themselves. The master was vigilant in the business 
of preservfng the ship ; but, as he went in and out of his 
cabin by me, I could hear him softly say to himself several * 
times. Lord, be merciful to us 1 we shall be all lost ; we 
shall be all undone ! and the like. During these first hurries 
\ was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steer- 
age, and cannot describe my temper. I could ill reassume 
the first penitence, which I had so apparently trampled upon, 
and hardened myself against ; I thought that the bittemesi 
of death had been past, and that this would be nothing too, 
'ike the first : but when the master himself came by me, ai 



IS ADYSNTURBS OF 

I riid just now, and s&Jd we should be all lost, I was dreaJ^ 
(ully frightened. I got up out of my cabin, and looked out ; 
but such a dismal sight I never saw ; the sea went mountains 
high, and bioke upon us every three or four minutes. When 
I could look about, I could see nothing but distress around 
as; two ships, that rid near us, we found had cut their 
/masts by the board, being deeply laden ; and our men cried 
out that a ship, which rid about a mile ahead of us, was 
foundered. Two mor^ ships being driven from their anchors, 
were run out of the roads to sea, at all adventures, and that 
with not a mast standing. The light ships fared the best, 
as not so much laboring in the sea ; but two or three o: 
them drove, and came close to us, running away, with only 
their spritsails out, before the wind. Toward evening, the 
mate and boatswain begged the master of our ship to let 
them cut away the foremast, which he was very loath to do ; 
but the boatswain protesting to him, that if he did not, the 
ship would founder, he consented ; and when they had cu« 
away the foremast, the mainmast stood so loose, and shook 
the ship so much, they were obliged to cut it awa^ also, and 
make a clear deck. 

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all 
this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such 
a fright before at but a little. But if I can express, at this 
distance, the thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in 
tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former 
convictions, and the having returned from them to the res* 
olutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death 
itself; and these, added to the terror of the storm, put roe 
into such a condition, that I can by no wovds describe it ; 
sat the worst was not come yet ; the storm continued with 
«ack fury, that the seamen themselves acknowledged they 
Aad never known a worse. We had a good ship, but she 
vaa deep laden, and so swallowed in the sea, tlat the soa-

was my advantage, in one respect, that I did not know wiiat 
they meant hj founder^ till I inquired. However, the storm 
was BO violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the mastei; 
the boatswain, and some others, more sensible than the rest* 
at their prayers, and expecting every moment the ship would 
go to the bottom. In the middle of the nighty and under 
all the rest of our distresses, one of the men, that had been 
down on purpose to see, cried out, we had spruxig a leak ; 
another said there was four feet water in the hold. Then 
all hands were called to the pump. At that very word my 
neart, as I thought, died within me, and I fell backwards 
upon the side of my bed, where I sat in the cabin. How- 
ever, the men roused me, and told me that I, who was able 
to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as another : 
at which I stirred up and went to the pump, aixl worked 
very heartily. While this was doing, the master seeing 
some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm, were 
obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would not come 
near us, ordered us to fire a gun, as a signal of distress. I, 
who knew nothing what that meant, was so surprised, that 
I thought the ship had broke, or some dreadful thing had 
nappened. In a word, I was so surprised, that I fell down 
in a Bwoofu As this was a time when everybody had his 
own life to think of, no one minded me, or what was become 
of me; but another man stepped up to the pump, and 
thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I 
had been dead ; and it was a great while before I came to 
myself. 

We worked on ; but the water increasing in the hold, it 
was apparent that the ship would founder ; and though the 
storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible she 
eouM swim till we might run into a port, so the mastei 
'wntinaed firing guns for help ; and a light ship, who had 
lid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us 
It was with the utmost hazard that the boat came near uii

our dtem, as he intended, we brought eight of our gum M 
bear on that side, and poured in a broadside upon him, 
which mude him sheer off again, after returning our fire, 
and pouring in also his smcdl shot from near two hundred 
men which he had on board. However, we had not a man 
touched, all our men keeping dose. He prepared to attack 
Q8 ag^iin, and we to defend ourselves; but laying us on 
board the next time upon our other quarter, he entered sixty 
men upon our decks, who immediately fell to cutting and 
backing the sails and rigging. We plied them with small 
shot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and cleared 
our deck of them twice. However, to cut short this melan- 
choly part of our story, our ship being disabled, and thrA 
of our men killed and eight wounded, we were obliged to 
yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port 
belonging to the Moors. 

The .usage I had there was not so dreadful as at fimt I 
apprehended: nor was I carried up the country to the 
emperor's court, as the rest of our men were, but was kept 
by the captain of the rover as his proper prize, and made his 
slave, being young and nimble, and fit for hi« businett. A* 
this surprising change of my circumstances, horn a merchant 
to a miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed ; and now 
looked back upon my father's prophetic discourse to me, 
that I should be miserable, and have none to relieve me; 
which I thought was now so effectually brought to pass, that 
it could not be worse ; that now the hand of Heaven had 
overtaken me, and I was undone, without redemption. But, 
alas ! this was but a taste of the misery I was to go through^ 
as will appear in the sequel of this story. 

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his 
Douse, so I was in hopes he would take me with him when 
ne went to sea again, believing that it would, some time or 
other, be hii fate to be taken by a Spanish or Porttiguese 
man of war, and that then I should be set at liberty, j^fi 



ROBINSON CRuSOB. 37 

Quia hope of mine was soon taken away, for when lie went to 
sea, he left me on shore to look after his little garden, and 
do the common drudgery of slaves about his house; 'and 
when he came home again from his cruise, he ordered me to 
lie in the cabin, to look after the ship. 

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what 
method I might take to effect it, but found no way that 
had the least probability in it. Nothing presented to make 
the supposition of it rational; for I had nobody to com* 
municate it to that would embark with me ; no fellow-slave, 
no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman there but myself; 
so that for two years, though I often pleased myself with 
the imagination, yet I never had the least encouraging proft- 
pect of putting it in practice. 

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented 
itself^ which put the old thought of making some attempt 
for my liberty again in my head. My patron lying at home 
longer iha|t usual, without fitting out his ship, which, as I 
heard, was for want of money, he used constantly, once 01 
twicer fk week, sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to 
take the ship's pinnacle, and go out into the road a fishing ; 
and as he always took me and a young Moresco with him to 
row the boat, we made him very merry, and I proved very 
dexterous in catching fish, insomuch that sometimes he 
would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the 
youth, the Moresco, as they called him, to catch a dish of 
fish for him. 

It happened one time, that going a fishing in a stark calm 
morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we were not half a 
league from the shore, we lost sight of it ; and rowing, w« 
knew not whither, or which way, we labored all day, and all 
the next night, and when the morning came, we found we 
had puUed off to sea, instead of pulling in for the shore, 
and that we were at least two leagues from the shore : how« 
t?er, we got well in again, though with a great deaJ et

boat : at the sanid time I found some powder of my m&ita^*i 
in the great cabin, with which I filled one of the large hot* 
ties in the case, which was almost empty, pouring what wai 
in it into ^fuiother ; and thus flimished with everything 
needful, we sailed out of the port to fish. The castle, which 
IS at the entrance of the port, knew who we were, and took 
DO notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the 
port, before we hauled in our sail, and set us down to fish* 
The wind blew from fix)m NN. £., which was contrary to my 
desire ; for, had it blown southerly, I had been sure to have 
made the coast of Spain, and at last reached the bay ol 
Cadiz : bat my resolutions were, blow which way it would, 1 
would V) gone fix)m the horrid place where I was, and leave 
the rest to fkte. 

After we had fished some time and catched nothing, for 
when I hi(d fish on my hook I would not pull them up, that 
he might not see them, I said to the Moor, This will not do ; 
our master will not be thus served; we must stand fitfther 
off. He, thinking no harm, agreed ; and being at the head 
of the boat, set the sails ; and as I had the helm, I nm the 
boat near a league fitfther, and then brought to, as if I would 
fish. Then giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to 
where the Moor was, and I took him by surprise, with my 
arm under his waist, and tossed him dear overboard into the 
sea. He rose immediately, for he awam like a cork, and 
called to me, begged to be taken in, and told me he would 
go all the world over with me. He swam so strong aftet 
the boat, that he would have reached me very quickly, there 
being but little wind ; upon which I stepped into the cabin, 
and fetdiing one of the*fi>wling'pieces, I presented it at him, 
and told him I had done him no hurt, and if he would bf 
)uiet, I would do him none : But, said I, you swim well 
enough to reach the shore, and the sea is calm : make the 
best of your way to shore, and I will do you no harm ; bm 
if yru come near the boat, I will shoot y: 3 t.hrou|i^ the 



BOBmSON CBUSOB. 4. 

iiead ; for I am resolved to liave my liberty. So he tamed 
himself about, and swam for the shore ; and I make no 
doabt bat be reached it with ease, for he was an excellent 
swimmer* 

I conld have been content to have taken this Moor with 
me, and have drowned the boy; but there was no venturing 
to trust him. When he was gone I turned to the boy, whom 
they called Xury, and said to him, Xury, if you will be 
&ithful to me I will make you a great man ; but if you will 
not stroke your hce to be true to me (that is, swear by Ma« 
homet and his father's beard), I must throw you into the sea 
too. The boy smiled in my &ce, and spoke so innocently, 
that I could not mistrust him ; and swore to be Mthful to 
me, and go all over the world with me. 

While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, 1 
stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to 
windward,* that they might think me gone towards the 
Strait's mouth (as indeed any one that had been in their 
wits must have been supposed to do) ; for who would have 
supposed we were sailing on to the southward, to the truly 
Barbarian coast, where whole nations of negroes were sure 
to surround us with their canoes, and destroy us ; where we 
could never once go on shore but we should be devoured by 
savage beasts, or more merciless savages of "human kind i 

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my 
course, and steered directly south and by east, bending my 
course a little towards the east, that I might keep in with 
the shore ; and having a fair fresh gale of wind, and a 
smooth quiet sea, I made such sail, that I believe by the 
next day, at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I made th6 
land, I could not be less than one hundred and fifty miles 
south of Sallee, quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's do« 
minions, or indeed of any other king thereabout ; for we saw 
ao people. 

Ye' such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and ths

dreadful appiehensions I had of falling intc their hania, that 
I would not stop, or go on shore, or come \o an anchor, thi 
wind continuing Mr, till I had sailed in that manner fivi 
days ; and then the wind shifting to the southward, I ooa* 
eluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, 
they also would now give oVer : so I ventured to make to 
the coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little 
river; I knew not what or where, neither what latitude, 
what country, what nation, or what river. I neither saw, 
nor desired to see, any people ; the principal thing I wanted 
was fresh water. We came into this creek in the evening, 
resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and dis- 
cover the country: hut as soon as it was quite dark, we 
heard such dreadful noises of the harking, roaring, and 
howling of wild creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that 
the poor- hoy was ready to die with fear, and begged of me 
not to go on shore till day. Well, Xury, said I, then I will 
not ; but it may be, we may see men by day, who will be as 
bad to us as those lions. Then we may give them the shoot- 
£pun; says ' Xury, laughing; make them run away. Such 
English Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves. How- 
ever, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him a 
dram out of our patron*s case of bottles to cheer him up. 
After air, Xury*s advice was good, and I took it. We dropped 
our little anchor, and lay still all night. I say still, for we 
■lept none ; for in two or three hours we saw vast creatures, 
(we knew not what to call them,) of many sorts, come dowa 
to the sea-shore, and run into the water, wallowing and 
washing themselves, for the pleasure of cooling themselves ; 
and they made such hideous bowlings and yellings, that I 
never indeed heard the like. 

Xury was dreadfully frightened, and indeed so was I too ; 
Out we were both more frightened when we heard one ol 
these mighty creatures swinmiing towards our boat: we 
stuld not see him, but we might hear him by his blowing 



ROBINSON CBUSOB. 43 

k) be a monstrous, huge, and furious beast. Xur} ^aii i1 
was a lion, and it might be so, for aught I know ; but pool 
Xury cried to me to weigh the anchor and row away. Noj 
•ays I, Xury ; we can slip our cable with a buoy to it, ana 
go off to sea : they cannot follow us far. I had no soonei 
said so, but I perceived the creature (whatever it was) within 
two oars* length, which something surprised me ; however, I 
immediately stepped to the cabin door, and taking up my 
gun, fired at him ; upon which he immediately turned i.bout» 
and swam to the shore again. 

But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, and 
hideous cries and bowlings that were raised, as well upon 
the edge of the shore as higher within the country, upon 
^he noise or report of the gun ; a thing, I believe, those 
creatures had never heard before. This convinced me there 
was no going on shore for us in the night upon that coast : 
and how to venture on shore in the day, was another ques- 
tion too ; for to have fallen into the hands of any of the 
savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into the paws of 
lions and tigers ; at least, we were equally a{)prehensive of 
the danger of it. 

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore 
somewhere or other for water, for we had not a pint left in 
the boat ; when and where to get it was the point. Xury said, 
J I would let him go on shore with one of the jars, he would 
find if there was any water, and bring some to me. I asked 
Him why he would go ; why I should not go, and he stay in 
the boat. The boy answered with so much affection, that 
he made me love him ever after. Says he, if wild mans 
oome, they eat me, you go away. — Well, Xury, said I, w? 
will both go ; and if the wild mans come, we will kill them ; 
they shall eat neither of us. So I gave Xury a piece oi 
•usk bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron's case of bot- 
'les, which I mentioned before ; and we hauled in the boat 
J near the shore as we thought was proper, and so wade^

to Bhoze, cairying nothing but onr anns, and tro jart kfk 
water. 

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing tin 
coming of canoes with savages down the river ; but the boy, 
•eeing a low place aboat a mile up the country, rambled to 
It ; and, by and by, I saw him come running towards me. 
( thought he was pursued by some savage, or frightened by 
«ome wild beast, and I therefore ran forwards to help lim ; 
bat when I came nearer to him, I saw something hanging 
over his shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, 
like a hare, but different in color, and longer legs : however* 
we were very glad of it, and it was very good meat : but the 
great joy that poor Xury came with, was to tell me he had 
found good water, and seen no wild mans. 

But we found afterwards that we need not take such pains 
for water ; for a little higher up the creek where w» were, 
we found the water fresh when the tide was out, which 
flowed but a little way up ; so we filled our jars, and having 
a fire, feasted on the hare we had killed ; and prepared to 
go on our way, having seen no footsteps of any human crea- 
ture in that part of the country. 

As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew 
very well that the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de 
Verd Islands also, lay not hi from the coast. But as I had 
no instruments to take an observation, to find what latitude 
we were in ; and did not exactly know, or at least remem- 
ber, what latitude they were in, I knew not where to look 
for them, or when to stand off to sea towards them, other- 
wise I might now have easily found some of these islands. 
But my hope was, that if I stood along this coast till I came 
to the part where the English trad<^, I should find some of 
their vessels upon their usual design of trade, that would 
relieve and take us in. 

By the best of my calculation, the place where I now was, 
must be that oountar which, lying between the Emperar ol 



ROiiirrsON CRUSOE. ii 

kCoTOCCO*8 dominions and the Negroes, lies waste, and imiii* 
habited, except by wild beasts ; the Negroes ha^ ing aban 
doned it, and gone farther sonth, for fear of the Moors, and 
Ihe Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason ol 
its barrenness ; and, indeed both forsaking it because of the 
prodigious numbers of tigers, lions, leopards tfnd othei 
fbrious creatures which harbor there : so that the Moors ufe 
it for their hunting only, where they go like an army, two or 
three thousand men at a time : and, indeed, for near a hun- 
dred miles together upon this coast, we saw nothing but a 
waste, uninhabited country by day, and heard nothing but 
bowlings and roaring of wild beasts by night. 

Once or twice, in the day-time, I thought I saw the Pico 
of Teneriffe, being the top of the mountain Teneriffe, in the 
Canaries, and had a great mind to venture out, in hopes of 
reaching thither; but having tried twice, I was forced in 
again by contrary winds ; the sea also going too high for my 
little vessel ; so I resolved to pursue my first design, and 
keep along the shore. 

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after 
we had left this place ; and once, in particular, being early 
In the morning, we came to an anchor under a little point of 
land which was pretty high ; and the tide beginning to flow, 
we lay still, to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were mort 
about him than, it seems, mine were, calls softly to me, and 
tells me, that we had best go further off the shore ; for, says 
he. Look, yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that 
hillock, fast asleep. I looked where he pointed, and saw a 
dreadful monster indeed, for it was a terrible great lion, that 
ay on the side of the shore, tmder the shade of a piece ol 
(he hill, that hung, as it were, over him. Xury, says I, you 
ihall go on shore and kill him. Xury looked frightened^ 
and said. Me kill ! he eat me at one mouth': one mouthf^ 
he meant. However, I said no more to the boy but bade 
liim be still ; and I took our biggest gun, ^hich was almost 



le ADVENTURES OF 

muBket bote, &nd loaded it witli a good charge of o^wder, 
and with two alugs, and laid it down ; tnen I loaded anothei 
gun with two bullets : and a third, for we had three pieces, 
I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best aim I 
could with the first piece, to have shot him in the head ; but 
ne lay so, with his leg raised a little above his nose, that the 
slugs hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bone : he 
itarted up, growling at first, but finding his leg broke, fell 
iown again and then got up upon three legs, and gave the 
most hideous roar|llhat ever I heard. I was a little surprised 
that I had not hit him on the head ; however, I took up the 
second piece immediately, and though he began to move off, 
fired again, and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure 
to see him drop, and make but little noise, but lie struggliiig 
for life. Then Xury took heart, and would have me let him 
go on shore. Well, go, said I ; so the boy jumped into th4 
water, and taking a little gun in one hand, swam to shore 
with the other hand, and coming close to the creature, put 
the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him in the hend 
again, which despatched him quite. 

This was game, indeed, to us, but it was no food ; and I 
was very sorry to loose three charges of powder and shot 
upon a creature that was good for nothing to us. However, 
Xury said he would have some of him ; so he comes on 
board, and asked me to give him the hatchet: for what« 
Xury ? said I. Me cut off his head, said he. However, 
Xury could not cut off his head ; but he cut off a foot, and 
brought it with him, and it was a monstrous great one. I 
bethought myself^ however, that perhaps the skin of him 
might, one way or other, be of some value to us ; and I 
resolved to take off his skin, if I could. So Xury and I 
went to work with him : but Xury was much the better 
workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed, is 
look us both up the whole day ; but at last we got off the 
hide of him. and spreading it on the ti^ of our cabin, th«i

lun effectually dried it in two days' time, anl it afleiwardi 
lerved me to lie upon. 

After this stop we made on to the soutliward continually^ 
for ten or twelve days, living very sparingly on our provis- 
ions, which began to abate very much, and going no oftenei 
into the shore than we were obliged to for fresh water. My 
design in this, was to make the river Gambia, or Senegal : 
that is to say, anywhere about the Cape de Verd, where I 
was in hopes to meet with some European ship ; and if I 
did not, I kneV not what course I had to take, but to seek 
for the islands or perish among the Negroes. I knew that 
all the ships from Europe, which sailed either to the coast ol 
Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this Cape, 
or those blands : and in a word I put the whole of my for- 
tune upon this single point, either that I must meet with 
some ship, or must perish. 

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, 
as I have said, I began to see that the land was inhabited ; 
and in two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people 
stand upon the shore to look at us : we could also perceive 
they were quite black and stark naked. I was once inclined 
to have gone on shore to them ; but Xury was my better 
counsellor, and said to me. No go, no go. However, I 
hauled in nearer the shore, that I might talk to them ; and 1 
found they ran along the shore by me a good way. I 
observed they had no weapons in their hands, except one, 
who had a long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, 
and that they would throw them a great way with good aim ; 
80 ] kept at a distance, but talked to them by signs, ai 
well as I could, and particularly made signs for something to 
eat. They beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would 
fetch me some meat : upon this I lowered the top of my 
•ail, and lay by, and two of them ran up into the country j 
«nd in less than half an hour came back, and brough*^ with 
tbem two pie'^es of dry flesh and some corn, such as th« 



<g ADVBNTURK8 OF 

pxoduce of their country ; but we neither kne^ what thit 
one or the other was ; however, we were willing to aocepi 
It. ^ But how to come at it was our next dispute, for I was 
not for venturing on shore to them, and they were as much 
afraid of us : but they took a safe way for us all, for they 
brought it to the shore, and laid it down, and went and 
stood a great way off till we fetched it on board, and then 
eant^ close to us again. 

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing tc 
make them amends; but an opportunity offered that very 
instant to oblige them wonderfully ; for while we were lying 
by the shore, came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the 
other (as we took it) with great fury, from the mountains 
towards the sea; whether it was the male pursuing the 
female, or whether they were in sport or in rage, we*couid 
not tell, any more than we could tell whether it was usual 
or strange ; but I believe it was the latter, because, in the 
first place, those ravenous creatures seldom appear but 
in the night ; and, in the second place, we found the 
people terribly frightened, especially the women. The man 
that had the lance, or dart, did not fly from them, but 
the rest did;, however, as the two creatures ran directly 
into the water, they did not seem to offer to &XL upon any 
of the Negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and 
swam about, as if they had come for their diversion ; at last, 
one of them began to come nearer our boat than I at first 
expected ; but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded my gun 
with all possible expedition, and bade Xury load both th« 
others. As soon as he came fairly within my reach, I fired, 
and shot him directly in the head : immediately he sunk 
"^Awn into the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and 
^wn, as if he was struggling for life, and so indeed he was : 
he immediately made to the shore ; but between the wound 
which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, 
he died just before he reached the shore. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 4^ 

It is impossible to express the astomshmeiit of these pooi 
treatures, at the noise and fire of my gun; some of thero 
were even ready to die for fear, and fell down as dead with 
the very terror ; but when they saw the creature dead, and 
sunk in the water, and that I made signs to them to come t:: 
tl.e shore, they took heart and came to the shore, and began 
to search for the creature. I found him by his blood staining 
the water ; and by the help of a rope, which I slimg round 
IJm, and gave the Negroes to haul, they dragged him on 
slioie, and found that it was a most curious leopard, spotted, 
and fine to an admirable degree ; and the Negroes held up 
their hands with admiration, to think what it was I had 
killed him with. 

The other creature, frightened with the flash of fire, and 
the noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to 
the mountains from whence they came ; nor could I, at that 
distance, know what it was. I found quickly the Negroes 
were for eating the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to 
bive them take it as a favor from me; which, when I made 
signs to them that they might take him, they were very 
thankful for. Immediately they fell to work with him ; and 
though they had no knife, yet with a sharpened piece ot 
wood, they took ofi* his skin as readily, and much more 
readily, than we could have done with a knife. They offered 
me some of the flesh, which I declined, making as if I would 
give it them, but made signs for the skin, which they gave 
me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their 
provisions, which, though I did not understand, yet I ac- 
cepted. I then made signs to them for some water, and held 
out one of my jars to them, turning it bottom upwards, to 
I how that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. 
They called immediately to some of their friends, and there 
came two wcmen, and brought a great vessel made of earth, 
and burnt, as I suppose, in the sun ; this they set down to 
iiv\ as K^for*^. and I' sent Xury op shore with my jaw, and 
6

filled them all three. The women were jls stark nuked at 
the men. 

I was now furnished with roots and com sucn as it was, 
and water; and leaving my friendly Negroes, I made 
forward for about eleven days more, withe :it offeriog to 
go near the shore, till I saw the land run out a great length 
Into the sea, at about the distance of four or five leagues 
before me; and the sea being very calm, I kept a large 
effing, to make this point. At length, doubJ^ng the point, 
at ab^ut two leagues frt>m the land, I saw plainly land on 
the other side, to seaward : then I concluded, as it was most 
certain indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and those 
the islands, called, from thence, Cape de Verd Islands. 
However, they were at a great distance, and I could not 
well tell what I had best to do ; for if I should be taken 
with a gale of wind, I might neither reach one nor the 
other. 

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the 
cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the helm ; wh«m, on a 
sudden, the boy cried out. Master, master, a ship with a sail ! 
and the foolish boy was frightened out of his wits, thinking 
it must needs be some of his master's ships sent to pursue 
us, when I knew we were gotten far enough out of their 
rea/4i. I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not 
only the ship, but what she was, viz., that it was a Portu* 
guese ship, and, as I thought, was bound to the coast of 
Guinea, for Negroes. But, when I observed the course she 
steered, I was soon convinced they were bound some othet 
iray, and did not design to come any nearer to the shore ; 
upon whi:h, I stretched out to sea as much as I could, re- 
Bolviag to speak with them, if possible. 

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be 
able to come in their way, but that they would be gone by 
oefore I could make any signal to them; but after I had 
crowded to the utmost, and began to despair, they, it seemi^

law me, by the help of their perspective glasses, and tLat ii 
*va8 some European boat, which, they supposed, must belong 
to some ship that was lost : so they shortened sail, to let me 
come up. I was encouraged with this, and as I had my 
patron's ensign on board, I made a waft of it to^em, for a 
signal of distress, and fired a gun, both which they saw ; 
f: r they told me they saw the smoke, though they did net 
hear the gun. Upon these signals, they very kindly brought 
to, i^nd lay by for me ; and in about three hours* time I came 
up with them. 

. They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, 
ttnd in French, but I understood none of them ; but, at last, 
a Scotch sailor who was on board, called to me, and I an- 
swered him, and told him I was an Englishman, that I had 
made my escape out of slavery from the Moors, at Sallee : 
they then bade me come on board, and very kindly took me 
'n, and all my goods. 

It was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will 
believe, that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from 
such a miserable, and almost hopeless, condition as I was in ; 
and I immediately offered all I had to the captain of the ship, 
as a return for my deliverance ; but he generously told me, he 
^\ould take nothing from me, but that all I had should be 
delivered safe to me, when I came to the Brazils. For, says 
he, I have saved your life on no other terms than I would be 
glad to be saved myself; and it may, one time or other, bo 
my lot to be taken up in the same condition. Besides, said 
ne, when I carry you to the Brazils, so great a way from 
four own country, if I should take from you what you have, 
) ou will be starved there, and then I only take away that 
hfe 1 had given. No, no, Senhor Ingles (Mr. PingKshman), 
gays he, I will carry you thither in charity, and these thingi 
wul help to buy your subsistence there, and your pass/tgs 
'lome aj^ain.

A.8 he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in thi 
performance, to a tittle: for he ordered the seamen, that 
none should offer to touch anything I had: then he took 
everything into his own possession, and gave me back an 
exact inventory of them, that I might have them, even so 
much as my three earthen jars. 

As to my boat, it was a very good one ; and that he saw^ 
and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's use ; and 
asked me what I would have for it ? 1 told him, he had 
been so generous to me in everything, that 1 could not offer 
to make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to him : 
upon which, he told me he would give me a note of hand to 
pay me eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil ; and when it 
3ame there, if any one offered to give more, he would make 
it up. He offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy 
Xury, which I was loath to take ; not that f was not willing 
to let the captain have him, but I was very loath to sell the 
poor boy's liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in pro- 
curing my own. However, when I let him know; my reason, 
he owned it to be just, and offered me this medium, tbat ho 
would give the boy an obligation to set him free in .en 
vei^rs, if he turned Christian; upon this, and Xury saying 
he was willing to go with him, I let the captain have him. 

We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in 
In^ Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, in abou; 
Itventy-two days after. And now I was once more delivered 
Lorn the most ndserable of all conditions of life; and what 
'o do next with myself, I was now to consider. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 54 

The generous treatment t^^e captain gave me, I can nevei 
enough remember: he would take nothing of me for my 
passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's skin, and 
forty for the lion's skin, which I had in my boat, and caused 
everything I had in the ship to be punctually delivered to 
me ; and what I was willing to sell, he bought of me ; such 
as the case of bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the 
lump of beeswax, — for I had made candles of the rest : in 
a word^ I made about two hundred and twenty pieces ol 
eight of all my cargo ; and with this stock, I went on shore 
in the Brazils. 

I had not been long here, before I was recommended to 
the house of a good honest man, like himself, who had an 
ingenio as they call it (that is, a plantation and a sugar- 
house). I lived with him some time, and acquainted myself, 
by that means, with the manner of planting and of making 
sugar; and seeing how well the planters lived, and how 
they got rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could get a license to 
settle there, I would turn planter among them : endeavoring, 
in the meantime, to find out some way to get my money, 
which I had left in London, remitted to me. To this pur- 
pose, getting a kind of letter of naturalization, I purchased 
as much land that was uncured as my money would reach, 
and formed a plan for my plantation and settlement ; «uch a 
one as might be suitable to the stock which I proposed to 
myself to receive from England. 

I had a neighbor, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but bom ot 
English parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such 
circumstances as I was. I call him my neighbor, because 
his plantation lay next to mine, and we went on very socia- 
bly together. My stock was but low, as well as his ; and 
we rather planted for food than anything else, for about two 
years. However, we began to increase, and our land began 
to come in order ; so that the third year we planted som# 
k>^&:c3, and made each of us a large piece of ground read|

54 ADVENTURES OF 

hr Planting canes in the year t9 come ; but we hith wati eJ 
Aelp ; and now I found more than before, I had done wron^ 
in parting with my boy Xury. 

But, alas ! for me to do wrong, that never did right, wat 
ao great wonder. I had no remedy, but to go on : I had 
got into an employment quite remote to my genius, and di* 
rectly contrary to the life I delighted in, and for which 1 
forsook my father's house, and broke through all his goad 
ftdvice : nay, I was coming into tiie very middle station, oi 
upper degree of low life, which my father advised me to 
before ; and which, if I resolved to go on with, I nught as 
well have staid at home, and never have fatigued myself in 
the world, as I had done : and I used often to say to myself^ 
I could have done this as well in England, among my Mends, 
as to have gone five thousand miles off to do it among 
strangers and savages, in a wilderness, and at such a dis^ 
tance as never to hear from any part of the world that had 
the least knowledge of me. 

In this manner, I used to look upon my condition with 
the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now 
and then tiiis neighbor ; no work to be done, but by the 
labor of my hands : and I used to say, I lived just like a 
man cast away upon some desolate island, that had nobody 
there but himself. But how just has it been ! and how 
should all men reflect, that when they compare their present 
conditions with others that are worse. Heaven may oblige 
them to make the exchange, and be convinced of their 
former felicity by their experience : I say, how just has it 
been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on, in an island 
of mere desolation, should be my lot, who had so often un- 
{ustly compared it with the life which I then led, in which, 
had I continued, I had, in all probability, been exceeding 
prosperous and rich ! 

I was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying 
»ii the plantation, before my kind friend, the captam of tht 



aOBINSON CRUSOE. 54 

ihip that took me up at sea, went back ; for the ship re- 
mained there, in providing his lading, and preparing for his 
voyage, near three months ; when telling him what liltle 
stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me this 
friendly and sincere advice : Senhor Inglez, says he (for sc 
he always called me), if you will give me letters, and a pro- 
curation here in form to me, with orders to the person who 
has your money in London, to send your effects to Lisbon, 
to such persons as I shall direct, and in such goods as are 
propel for this country, I will bring you the produce of 
them, God willing, at my return : but since human affairs 
are all subject to changes and disasters, I would have you 
give orders for but one hundred pounds sterling, which, you 
say, is half your stock, and let the hazard be run for the 
first, so that if it come safe, you may order the rest the same 
way ; and, if it miscarry, you may have the other half to 
have recourse to for your supply. This was so wholesome 
advice, and looked so friendly, that I could not but be con- 
vinced it was the best course I could take ; so I accordinglv 
prepared letters U the gentlewoman with whom I left m 
money, and a procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he 
desired me. 

I wrote the English captain's widow a f'./d account of all 
my adventures ; my slavery, escape, and how I had met with 
the Portuguese captain at sea, the humanity of his behavior, 
and what condition I was now in, with all other necessary 
directions for my supply ; and when this honest captain 
came to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English 
merchants there, to send over, not the order only, but a full 
tccount of my story to a merchant at London, who repre- 
lented it effectually to her *• whereupon she not only deliv- 
ered tlie money, but, out of her own pocket, sent the Portu- 
guese captain a very handsome present for his humanity and 
iharity to me.

Englisli goods, such as the captam had wrote for, 8^5nt theu 
directly to him at Lisbon^ and he brought them %dl safe to 
me at the Brazils : among which, without my direction (fox 
I was too young in my business- to think of them), he had 
taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils, 
necessai y for my plantation, and which were of great use to 
me. Allien this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune made, 
for I was surprised with joy of it ; and my good steward, 
Uie captain, had laid out the five pounds, which my Mend 
had sent him as a present for himself, to purchase and bring 
me over a servant, under bond for six years' service, and 
would not accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco, 
which I would have him accept, being of my omtu produce. 
Neither was this all : but my goods being all English manu- 
fiu^tures, such as cloths, stu£Qi, baize, and things particularly 
valuable and desirable in the country, I found means to sell 
them to a very great advantage ; so that I might say, I had 
more than four times the value of my first cargo, and was 
now infinitely beyond my poor neighbor, I mean in the ad- 
ancement of my plantation : for the first thing I did, I 
nought me a Negro slave, and a European servant also : 1 
mean another besides that which the captain brought me 
from Lisbon. 

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very 
means of our adversity, so was it with me. I went on the 
next year with great success in my plantation ; I raised fifty 
great rolls of tobacco on my own ground, more than 1 had 
disposed of for necessaries among my neighbors : and these 
fifty rolls, being each of above one hundred pounds weight, 
were well cured, and laid by against the return of the fleet 
from Lisbon : and now, increasing in business and in wealth, 
my head began to be full of projects and undertakings be- 
yond my reach ; such as are, indeed, often the ruin of thi 
Dett heads in bunnest. Had I continued in ^h» station ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 5| 

irai now in, 1 had room for all the happy »rtings to have yel 
befallen me, for which my father so earnestly recommended 
a quiet, retired life, and which he had so sensibly described 
the middle station of life to be full of: but other things at* 
tended me, and I was still to be the wilful agent of all my 
own miseries ; and, particularly, to increase my fault, and 
double the reflections upon myself, which in my future sor- 
rows I should have leisure to make, all these miscarriage! 
were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering to my 
foolish inclination, of wandering about, and pursuing that 
inclination^ in *^contradiction to the clearest views of doing 
myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects, 
and those measures of life, which nature and Providence 
concurred to present me with, and to make my duty. 

As I had once done thus in breaking away from my 
parents, so 1 could not be content now, but I must go and 
leave the happy view I had of being a rich and thriving man 
in my new plantation, only to pursue a rash and immoderate 
desire of rising faster than the nature of the thing admitted; 
and thus I cast myself down again into the deepest gulf oi 
human misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be 
consistent with life, and a state of health in the world. 

To come then, by just degrees, to the particulars of this 
ijart of my story. — You may suppose, that ha\'ing now 
lived almost four years in the Brazils, and beginning to 
thrive and prosper very well upon my plantation, I had not 
only learned the language, but had contracted an acquaint- 
ance and friendship among my fellow-planters, as well an 
among the merchants of St. Salvador, which was our port : 
and that, in my discourses among them, I had frequently 
l^iven them an account of my two voyages to the coast o. 
Siiinea, the manner of trading with the Negroes there, and 
low easy it was to purchase on the coast for trifles — s^cb 
%8 beads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glats, and 



88 ADVENTURES OF 

•he like — not only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants 
(e<*th, d&c, but Negroes, for the service of the Brazils, u 
grea. numbers. 

They listened always very attentively to my discourses oft 
these heads, but especially to that part which related to the 
buying Negroes ; which was a trade, at that time, not only 
not far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been carried 
on by the asnerUos, or permission of the kings of Spain and 
Portugal, and engrossed from the public ; so that fen 
Negroes were bought, and those excessively dear. 

It happened, being in company with some' merchants and 
planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those things 
very earnestly, three of Ihem came to me the next morning, 
and told me they had been musing very much upon what I 
had discoursed with them of the last night, and they camo 
to make a secret proposal to me : and, after enjoining me to 
secrecy, they told me that they had a mind to fit out a ship 
to go to Ghiinea ; that they had all plantations as well as I, 
and were straitened for nothing so much as servants ; that it 
was a trade that could not be carried on, because they could 
not publicly sell the Negroes when they came home, so they 
desired to make but one voyage, to bring the Negroes on 
shore privately, and divide them among their own planta- 
tions ; and, in a word, the question was, whether I would 
go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part 
upon the coast of Guinea ; and they offered me that I should 
have an equal share of the Negroes, without providing %ny 
part of the stock. 

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been 
made to any one that had not a settlement and plantation ol 
hb own to look after, which was in a fair way of coming to 
be very considerable, and with a good stock upon it. But 
'or me, that was thus entered and established, and had no- 
thing to do but go otk as I had begun, for three or four yean 
«iore« ar d to have sent for the other hundred pounds from 



jaOBINSON CRUSOR 5f 

England ; and who, in that time and with that little addi- 
tion, could scarce have failed of being worth three or foui 
thousand pounds sterling, and that increasing too ; for me 
to think of such a voyage, was the most preposterous tiring 
that ever man, in such circumstances, could be guilty of. 

But I, that was bom to be my own destroyer, could no 
more resist the offer, than I could restrain my first rambling 
designs, when my father's good counsel was lost upon me. 
In a word, I told them I would go with all my heart, if they 
would undertake to look after my plantation in my absence, 
and would dispose of it to such as I should direct, if I mis 
♦»rried. This they all engaged to do, and entered into 
writings or covenants to do so : and I made a formal will, 
disposing of my plantation and effects, in case of my death ; 
making the captain of the ship that had saved my life, as 
before, my universal heir ; but obliging him to dispose of my 
effects as I had directed in my will ; one-half of the produce 
being to himself, and the other to be shipped to England. 
In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects, 
and to keep up my plantation : had I used half as much 
prudence to have looked into my own interest, and have 
made a judgment of what I ought to have done, and not to 
have done, I had certainly never gone away from so prosper- 
ous an undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a 
thriving circumstance, and gone a voyage to sea, attended 
with all its common hazards, to say nothing of the reasons 
I had to expect particular misfortunes to myself. 

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates ol 
my fancy, rather than my reason : and accordingly, the ship, 
being fitted out, and the cargo furnished, and all things done 
as by agreement, by my partners in the voyage, I went on 
boaid in an evil hour again, the first of September, 1659, 
being the same day eigit years that I went from my parent* 
tt Hull, in order to act 'he rebel to their authority, and thi 
fool to my 0V1 interes^. 



IK) ADVENTURES OF 

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty ti ns burdeiii 
carried six guns and fourteen men, besides the master, hii 
boy, and myself ; we had on board no large cargo of goods, 
except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the Ne- 
groes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd trifles, 
especially little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, 
und the like. 

The very same day I went on board we set sail, standing 
away to the northward upon our own coast, with design to 
Rtretch over for the African coast. When they came about 
ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, it seems, 
was the manner of their course in those dayv, we had very 
good weather, only excessively hot all the way upon our own 
coast, till we came to the height of Cape St. Augustino ; 
from whence, keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight oi 
land, and steered as if we were bound for the isle Fernando 
de Noronha, holding our course N.E. by N. and leaving 
those isles on the east. In this course we passed the Line 
in about twelve days' time, and were, by our last observa- 
tion, in seven degrees twenty-two minutes northern latitude, 
when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of 
jur knowledge : it began from the south-east, came about to 
the north-west, and then settled in the north-east; from 
whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for twelve 
days together we could do nothing but drive, and, scudding 
away before it, let it carry us whithersoever fate and the fury 
of the winds directed ; and, during these twelve days, I 
need not say that I expected every day to be swallowed up, 
nor, indeed, did any in the ship expect to save their lives. 

I n t his distress, we had, besides the terror of tiie storm, 
one of our men died of the calenture, and one man and a 
boy washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the wealhei 
abating a little, the master made an observation as well as 
tie could, and found that he was in about eleven degreei

to consult with me what course he should take, for the ?hip 
was leaky and very much disabled, and he was for going di- 
rectly back to the coast of Brazil. 

I was positively against that ; and looking over the charti 
of the sea-coast of America, with him, we concluded there 
was no inhabited country for us to have recourse to, till we 
came mthin the circle of the Carribee islands, and there- 
fore resolved to stand away for Bai badoes ; which by keeping 
off to sea, to avoid the indraft of the bay or gulf of Mexico, 
we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days* 
sail ; whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to the 
coast of Africa without some assistance, both to our ship and 
ourselves. 

With this design, we changed our course, and steered 
away N.W. by W. in order to reach some of our English 
islands, where 1 hoped for relief : but our voyage was other- 
wise determined ; for being in the latitude of twelve degrees 
eighteen minutes a second storm came upon us, which carried 
us away with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us 
so out of the very way of all human commerce, that had all 
our lives been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in dangei 
of being devoured by savages than ever returning to our own 
country. 

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of 
our men early in the morning, cried out. Land ! and we had 
no sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing 
whereabouts in the world we were, than the ship struck upon 
a sand, and in a moment, her motion being so stopped, the 
uea broke over her in such a manner, that we expected we 
iL Duld all he ? perished immediately ; and we were immedi 
6 



ei ADVENTURES OK 

ately driven into our close quarters, to «heltej as fiom thi 
very foam and spray of the sea. 

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like 
condition to describe or conceive the consternation of men in 
•uch circumstances : we knew nothing where we were, oi 
upon what land it was we were driven, whether an island oi 
the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited ; and as the 
rage of the wind was still great, though rather less than at 
first, we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold 
many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the wind, 
by a kind of miracle, should immediately turn about. In a 
word we sat looking upon one another, and expecting death 
every moment, and every man acting accordingly, as pre- 
paring for another world ; for there was little or nothing 
more for us to do in this : that which was our present com- 
fort, and all the comfort we had, was, that, contrary to our 
expectation, the ship did not break yet, and that the master 
•aid the wind began to abate. 

Now, though we thought that the wind did a httle abate, 
yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking 
too fast for us to expect her getting oflf, we were in a dread- 
ful condition indeed, and had nothing to do, but to think of 
saving our lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our 
stern just before the storm, but she was first staved by dash- 
ing against the ship's rudder, and, in the next place, she 
broke away, and either sunk, or was driven ofi* to sea ; so 
there was no hope from her : we had another boat on board, 
but how to get her off into the sea was a <ioubtful thing ; 
however, there was no room to debate, for we fancied the 
•hip would break in pieces every minute, and some told us 
she was actuallv broken already. 

In this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of thb 
boat, and with the help of the rest of the men, they got her 
flung over the ship's side ; and getting all into her, we let 
aer go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in number, u 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ei 

God's mercy, and the wild sea : for though the storm Mra# 
abated considerably, yet the sea went dreadfully high upoa 
the shore, and might be well called den wild zee, as the 
Dutch call the sea in a storm. 

And now our case was very dismal indeed ; for we ah saw 
plainly, that the sea went so high, that the boat could not 
live, and that we should be inevitably drowned. As to 
making sail, we had none ; nor, if we had, could we have 
done anything with it ; so we worked at the oar towards th( 
lk/»d, though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution ; 
iot' we all knew that when the boat came nearer to the shore, 
she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach ol 
the* sea. However, we committed our souls to God in the 
must earnest manner ; and the wind driving us towards the 
shore, we hastened our destruction with our own hands, 
pulling as well as we could towards land. 

What the shore was •* — whether rock or sand, whether 
«teep or shoal — we knew not ; the only hope that could 
rationally give us the least shadow of expectation, was, il 
we might happen into some bay or gulf, or the mouth oi 
some river, where by great chance we might have run our 
boat in, or got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made 
smooth water. But nothing of this appeared ; and as we 
made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more 
frightful than the sea. 

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and 
a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, c^me 
tiling astern of us, and plainly bade us expect the cmip de 
grace. In a word, it took us with such fury, that it overset 
the boat at once ; and separating us, as well from the boat 
VLS from one another, gave us not time hardly to say, " 
God ! " for we were all swallowed up in a moment. 

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which 1 
felt, when I sunk into the water ; for though I swam very 
»f«lJ, yet I could not deliver myself from the waves so a/ t« 



64 ADVENTURES OF 

draw my breath, till that wave having driven me» or rachef 
carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and having 
spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almosl 
dry, but half dead with the water I took in. I had so much 
presence of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing myseli 
aearer the main land than I expected, I got upon my feet, 
and endeavored to make on towards the land as fast as 
could, before another wave should return and take me up 
again ; but I soon found it was impossible to avoid it ; for 1 
«aw the sea come after me as high as a great hill, and as 
furious as an enemy which I had no means or strength to 
tontend with : my business was to hold my breath, and raise 
myself upon the water, if I could ; and so, by swimming, to 
preserve my breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore, 
if possible ; my greatest concern now being, that he wave, 
as it would carry me a great way towards the shore when it 
came on, might not carry me back again with it when it gave 
back towards the sea. 

The wave that came upon me again buried me at oivce 
twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body ; and I could teel 
myself carried with mighty force and swiftness towards tho 
Rhore, a very great way ; but I held my breath, and assisted 
myself to swim still forward with all my might. I wa* 
ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as I fell 
myself rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found m^ 
Qead and hands shoot out above the surface of the water ; 
and though it was not tsvo seconds of time that I could 
keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath 
and new courage. I was covered again with water a good 
while, but not so long but I held it out; and finding the 
water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck forwanl 
against the return of the waves, and felt ground again with 
my feet. I stood still a few moments, to recover breath, and 
till the water went from me, and then took to my heels, and 
mr Mrith what strength I ha fartl.er towards the shore

ROBINSON CRUSOE. ft^ 

But neither would this deliver me from the fury ot the sea 
which came pouring in after me again ; and twice more I 
was lifted up by the waves and carried forwards as before, 
the shore being very flat. 

The list time of these two had well nigh been fatal to 
me ; for the sea, having hurried me along, as before, landed 
me, or rather dashed me, against a piece of a rock, and that 
with such force, that it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, 
as tc my o\ni deliverance ; for the blow, taking my side and 
breast, beat the breath, as it were, quite out of my body ; 
and had it returned again immediately, I must have been 
strangled in the water : but I recovered a little before the return 
of the waves, and, seeing I should again be covered with 
the water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and 
so to hold my breath, if possible, till the wave went back. 
Now as the waves were not so high as the first, being nearei 
land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched 
another run, which brought me so near the shore, that the 
next wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swallow 
me up as to carry me away ; and the next run I took, I got 
to the main- land ; where, to my great comfort, I clambered 
up the cliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon the gra.ss, 
firee from danger, and quite out of the reach of the water. 

I was now landed, and safe on shore ; and began to look 
up and thank God that my life was saved, in a case wherein 
there were, some minutes before, scarcely any room to hope. 
I believe it is impossible to express, to the life, what t\\6 
ecstacies and transports of the soul are, when it is so saved, 
as I may say, out of the grave : and I did not wonder now 
at the custom, viz., that when a malefactor, who has the 
halter about his neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned 
off, and has a reprieve brought to him ; I say, I do not

For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first 

I wa Jced about on the shore, lifting up my hands, dnd m} 
whole being, as I may say, wrapped up in the contemplatir n 
of my deliverance ; making a thousand gestures and motions, 
which 1 cannot describe ; reflecting upon my comrades that 
were drowned, and that there should not be one soul saved 
but myself; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, 
or any sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and 
two shoes that were not fellows. 

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel — when the breach 
and froth of the sea being so big I could hardly see it, it lay 
BO &r off — and considered, Lord ! how was it possible 1 
could get on shore ? 

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part 
of my condition, I began to look around me, to see what 
kind of a place I was in, and what was next to be done ; 
and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in a 
word, I had a dreadful deliverance : for I was -wet, had no 
clothes to shift me, nor anything either to eat or diink, to 
comfort me ; neither did I see any prospect before me, but 
that of perishing with hunger, or being devoured by wild 
beasts : and that which was particularly afflicting to me was, 
that I had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature 
for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other 
creature that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, 
I had nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a 
little tobacco in a box. This was all my provision ; and 
fliis threw me into such terrible agonies of mind, that, for a 
while, I ran about like a madman. Night coming upon me, 
I bega*^ , with a heavy heart, to consider what would be mj 
lot if tl- re were any ravenous beasts in that country, ceeing

from the shore, to see if I could find -ny fresh water tc 
drink, which I did, to my great joy ; and having drank, and 
put a little tobacco into my mouth to prevent hunger, I wen 
tc the tree, and getting up into it, endeavored to place my- 
self 80 as that, if I should fall asleep, I might not fall ; and 
having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, for my defence, 
I took up my lodging ; and having been excessively fatigued, 
I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few 
could have done in my condition ; and found myself the 
most refreshed with it that I think I ever was on such an 
occasion.

When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the 
ftorm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as be* 
fore ; but that which surprised me most was, that the shi|] 
was lifted off in the night from the sand where she lay, b} 
the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as 
the rock which I at first mentioned, where I had been so 
bruised by the wave dashing me against it. This being 
within about % mile from the shore where I was, and the 
ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself on 
board, that a*, least I might save some necessary things for 
my use 



g^ ADVENTURES OP 

When I came down from my apartmen in he tree, 1 
looked about me again, and the first thing I fouLd was th« 
boat ; li lich lay, as the wind and the sea had tossed her up, 
upon the land, about two miles on my right hand. I walked 
as fai as I could upon the shore to have got to her ; bni 
found a neck, or inlet of water, between me and the boat, 
wliich was about half a mile broad ; so I came back for the 
present, being more intent upon getting at the ship, where I 
tLoped to find something for my present subsistence. 

A little after noon, I found the sea very calm, and the 
tide ebbed so far out, that I could come within a quarter ol 
a mile of the ship : and here I found a fresh renewing of my 
grief; for I saw evidently, that if we had kept on board, we 
had been all safe; that is to say, we had all got safe on 
shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left entirely 
destitute of all comfort and company, as I now was. This 
forced tears from my eyes again ; but as there was little 
relief in this, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship : so 
1 pulled off my clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, 
and took the water : but when I came to the ship, my difii- 
culty was still greater to know how to get on board ; for as 
the lay aground, and high out of the water, there was nothing 
within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, 
and the second time I spied a small piece of rope, wnich I 
wondered I did not see at first, hang down by the fore-\;hains 
BO low, as that with great difficulty I got hold of it, and by 
the help of that rope got into the forecastle of the ship. 
Here I found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal oi 
water in her hold ; but that she lay so on the side of a bank 
of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stem lay lifted up 
upon the bank, and her head low, almost to the water. By 
this means all her quarter was free, and all that was in that 
part was dry ; for you may be sure my first work was ta 
search and to we what was spoiled and uhat was free ; and, 
first, I foicnd that all the ship*^ ^Tovisiorls were dry and Uk*

iOi.:hed by the water : and, being very well disjosed to ett, 1 
«rent to the bread-room, and filled my pockets with biscuit, 
and ate it as I went about other ^things, for I had no time to 
lose. I also found some mm in the great cabin, of which I 
took a large dram, and which I had indeed need enough of, 
to spirit me for what was before me. Now I wanted no- 
thing but a boat, to furnish myself with many things which 
I foresaw would be very necessary to me. 

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be 
had, and this extremity roused my application : we had 
several spare yards, and two or three large spars of wood, 
and a spare topmast or two in the ship ; I resolved to fall to 
work with these, and flung as many overboard as I could 
manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope, that 
they might not drive away. When this was done, I went 
do^vn to the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I tied foui 
of them fast together at both ends, as well as I could, in the 
form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank 
upon them, crossways, 1 found I could walk upon it very 
well, but that it was not able to bear any great weight, the 
pieces being too light ; so 1 went to work, and with thp 
carpenter's saw I cut a spare topmast into three lengths, and 
added them to my raft, with a great deal of labor and pains. 
But the hope of furnishing myself with necessaries, encour- 
aged me to go beyond what I should have been able to have 
done upon another occasion. 

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable 
weight. My next care was what to load it with, and how 
to preserve what I laid upon it from the surf of the sea : but 
I was not long considering this. I first laid all the planks 
or boards upon it that I could get, and having considered 
well what I most wanted, I got thre^ of the seamen's chests, 
which I had broken open and emptied, and lowered them 
iown upon my raft; these I filled with provisions, viz., 
iread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five piece& of dried goats' 



70 ADVENTURES OF 

^flesh (w!iich we lived much upon), and a little remainder ol 
European corn, which had heen laid by for some fowls whi^b 
we had brought to sea with us, but the fowls were killed. 
There had been some barley and wheat together, but, to my 
great disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had 
eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found several cases 
nf botdes belonging to our skipper, in which were some cor- 
dial wafers; and, in all, about five or six gallons of rack. 
Thes3 I stowed by themselves, there being no need to put 
them into the chests, nor any room Ibr them. While I was 
doing this, I found the tide began to flow, though very calm ; 
and I had the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waist- 
coat, which I had left on shore, upon the sand, swim away ; 
as for my breeches, which were only Hnen, and open-kneed, 
I swam on board in them, and my stockings. However, 
this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which I found 
enough, but took no more than I wanted for present use, for 
[ had other things which my eye was more upon : as, first, 
♦xjols to work with on shore : and it was after long searching 
^hat I found the carpenter's chest, which was indeed a very 
useful prize to me, and much more valuable than a ship- 
lading of gold would have been at that time. I got it down 
^0 my raft, even whole as it was, without losing time to look 
into it, for I knew in general what it contained. 

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There 
were two very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and 
iwo pistols ; these I secured first, with some powder homi 
and a small bag of shot, and two old rusty swprds. I knew 
there were three barrels of powder in the ship, but Inewnol 
^here our gimner had stowed them ; but with much search I 
t'uurd them, two of them dry and good, the third had takeo 
water. Those two I got to my raft, with the arms. And

lai], oar, n/r rudder; and the least capful of wiui woul^ 
hare overset all my na\*igatioii. 

I had three encouragements: 1st, A smooth, calm sea: 
2dly, The tide rising, and setting in to the shore ; 3dly 
What little wind there was blew me towards the land. And 
thus, having found two or three broken oars belonging to the 
boat, and besides the tools which were in the chest, I found 
two saws, an axe, and a hammer ; and with this cargo I put 
to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very well, 
only that I found it drive a little distant from the place 
where I had landed before ; by which I perceived that there 
was some indraft of the water, and consequently I hoped to 
find some creek or river there, which, I might make use ol 
as a port to get to land with my cargo. 

As I imagined, so it was : there appeared before me a 
little opening of the land, and I found a strong current of 
the tide set into it ; so I guided my raft, as well as I could, 
to get into the middle of the stream. But here I had like 
to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think 
it verily would have broken my heart ; for, knowing nothing 
of the coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a 
shoal, and, not being aground at the other end, it wanted 
but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards that 
end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water. I did my 
utmost, by setting my back against the chests, to keep them 
in their places, but could not thrust off the raft with all my 
strength ; neither durst I stir from the posture I was in, but 
holding up the chests with all my might, I stood in that 
manner near half an hour, in which time the rising of the 
water brought me a little more upon a level ; and a little 
afler, the water still- rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust 
lier off with the oar I had into the channel, and then driving 
up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a little 
'i'-er, with land on both sides, and a strong current or tide 



f2 ADVENTURES OF 

ranniog ap. I looked on both sides for a proper (lace to gei 
to shore, for I was not willing to be driven too high up the 
river ; hoping, in time, to see some ship at sea, and therefore 
resolved to place myself as near the coast as I could. 

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the 
creek, to which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my 
rail, and at last got so near, as that, reaching ground with 
my oar, I could thrust her directly in ; but here I had like 
(f have dipped all my cargo into the sea again ; for that 
shore lying pretty steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no 
place to land, but where one end of my float, if it ran on 
-shore, would lie so high, and the other sink lower, as before, 
that it would endanger my cargo again. All that I could do 
was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping the raft 
with my oar like an anchor, to hold the side of it fast to the 
shore, near a fiat piece of ground, which I jexpected the 
water would fiow over ; and so it did. As soon as I found 
water enough, for my raft drew about a foot of water, I 
thrust her upon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened 
or moored her, by sticking my two broken oars into the 
ground, one on one side, near one end, and one on the other 
side, near the other end : and thus I lay till the water ebbed 
away, and left my raft and all m) cargo safe on shore. 

My next work was to view the country, and seek a pLoper 
place for my habitation, and where to stow my goods, to se- 
cure them from whatever might happen. Where I was I yet 
knew not ; whether on the continent, or on an island ; 
whether inhabited, or not inhabited ; whether in danger of 
wild beasts, or not. There was a hill, not above a mile from 
me, which rose up very steep and high, and which seemed to 
overtop some other hills, which lay as in a ridge from it, 
northward. I took out one of the fowling-pieces, and one 
of the pistols, and a horn of powder ; and thus armed, I 
travelled for ^scovery up to the top of that hill ; where, 
Uller I had, with great labor and difficulty, got up to the top

1 Sdw :ny fate, to my great affiiction, viz., that I Wiis in iJi 
iBland, environed every way with the sea, no land to be seen, 
except some rocks, which lay a great way off, and two small 
Islanda, less than this, which lay about three leagues to the 
west. 

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as 1 
raw good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild 
beasts, of whom, however, I saw none ; yet I saw abundance 
of fowls, but knew not their kinds ; neither, when I killed 
them, could I tell what was fit for food, and what not. At 
my coming back, I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting 
upon a tree, on the side of a great wood. I believe it wan 
the first gun that had been fired there since the creation of 
the world : I had no sooner fired, but from all the parts of 
the wood there arose an innumerable number of fowls, of 
many sorts, making a confused screaming, and crying, every 
one according to his usual note ; but not one of them of any 
kind that I knew. As for the creature I killed, I took^t to 
be a kind of a hawk, its color and beak resembling it, but 
it had no talons or claws more than common. Its fiesh was 
carrion and fit for nothing. 

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, 
and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me 
up the rest of the day : what to do with myself at night 1 
knew not, nor indeed where to rest : for I was afraid to lie 
down on the ground, not knowing hut some wild beast might 
devour me ; though, as I afterwards found, there was really 
no need for thoie fears. However, ca well as I could, I barri- 
cadoed myself round with chests and boards that I had 
brought on shore, and made a kind of hut for that night's 
lodging. As for food, I yet saw not which way to supply 
myself, except that I had seen two or three creatures, like 
hares, run out of the wood where I shot the fowl. 

I new began to consider that I might yet get a great many 
things out of the ship, which would be useful to me, and

paiticiJarlj some of the rigging and sails, and siaeb oth%i 
things as might come to land ; and I resolved to naks 
another voyage on board the vessel, if possible. And as 1 
knew that the first storm that blew must necessarily break 
her all in pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart, tiU 
I arot everything out of the ship that I could get. Then I 
called a council, that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I 
should take back the raft ; but this appeared mipracticable ; 
so I resolved to go as before, when the tide was down ; and 
I did so, only that I stripped before I went from my hat ; 
having nothing on but a chequered shirt, a pair of linen 
drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet. 

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second 
raft ; and having had experience of the first, I neither made 
this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought 
away several things very useful to me : as, first, in the car- 
penter* s stores, I found two or three bags of nails and 
spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets ; and, 
above all, that most useful thing called a grindstone. All 
these I secured together, with several things belonging to 
the gunner ; particularly, two or three iron crows, and two 
barrels of musket bullets, seven muskets, and another 
fowling-piece, with some small quantity of powder more ; a 
large bag full of small shot, and a great roll of sheet lead*; 
but this Hst was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it over 
the ship's side. Besides these things, I took all the men's 
clothes that I could find, and a spare fore-topsail, a ham* 
mock, :>nd some bedding ; and with this I loaded my second 
raft, an'1 brought them all safe on shore, to my very great 
romfort. 

I was under some apprehensions lest, during my absence 
from the land, my provisions might be devoured on shore : 
but when I came back, I found no sign of any visitor ; only 
there sat a creature like a wild cat, upon one of the chests, 
which, when I cam" towards it, ran away a little distanca

be acquainted with me. I presented my gun to her, but, as 
she did not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at 
it, nor did she offer to stir away ; upon which I tossed her a 
bit of biscuit, though, by the way, I was not very free of it, 
for my store was not great ; however, I spared her a bit, I 
say, and she went to it, smelled of it, and ate it, and looked 
(as pleased) for more ; but I thanked her, and could spare 
no more : so she marched off. 

Having got my second cargo on shore — though I was fail* 
to open the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, 
for they were too heavy, being large casks — I went to work 
to make ne a little tent, with the sail, and some poles, 
which I cut for that purpose ; and into this tent I brought 
everything that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun; 
and I piled all the empty chests and casks up in a circle 
round the tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt either 
from man or beast. 

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent 
with some boards within, and an empty chest set up on end 
without ; and spreading one of the beds upon the ground, 
laying my two pistols just at my head, and my gun at 
length by me, I went to bed for the first time, and slept 
very quietly all night, for I was very weary and heavy ; for 
the night before I had slept little, and had labored very 
hard all day, as well to fetch all those things from the ship 
as to get them on shore. 

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was 
laid up, I believe, for one man : but I was not satisfied still ; 
for while the ship sat upright in that posture, I thought I 
ought to get everything out of her that I could ; so every 
d»v, at lew water, I went on boari, and brought aw..) 
•^•nething or other : but particularly the third time I went 
/ roHght a\iay as much of the rigging as 1 could, as alf«f 



76 ADVENTURllS OF 

All the imall ropes and rope-twine I couli get, with & pieei 
of spore canvas, which was to mend the saJs upon oca^ 
tion, and the harrel of wet gunpowder. In a word, I 
brought away all the sails first and last ; only that I was 
&in to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time as I 
could ; for they were no more useful to be sails, but as mere 
canvas only. 

But that which comforted me still more was, that, last o] 
all, after I had made five or six such voyages as these, and 
thought I had nothing more to expect firom the ship that 
was worth my meddling with ; I say, after all this, I found 
a great hogshead of bread, and throe large runlets of rum 
or spirits, and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour ; 
this was surprising to me, because I had given over expect- 
ing any more provisions, except what was spoiled by the 
water. I soon emptied the hogshead of that bread, and 
wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails, which 
I cut out ; and, in a word, I got all this safe on shore also. 

The next day I made another voyage, and now having 
plundered the ship of what was po^ble and fit to hand out, 
I began with the cables, and cutting the great cable into 
pieces such as I could move, I got two cables and a hawser 
on shore, with all the iron work I could get ; and having 
cut down the spritsail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and every- 
thing I could, to make a large rail, I loaded it with all ^hose 
heavy goods, and came away : but my good luck began now 
to leave me ; for this raft was so unwieldy, and so overladen, 
that after I was entered the little cove, where I had landed 
the rest of my goods, not being able to guide it so handily 
18 I did the other, it overset, and threw me and all my cargo 
intr the water ; as for myself, it was no great hanr., for I 
was near the shore ; but as to my cargo, it was a great part 
of it lost, es|)eciany the iron, which I expected would havs 
been of great use to me : however, when the tic'e was out, 
I got moet of the pieces of cable ashore, and i |m« of thi

hon, though with infinite labor ; for I was fain to dip for it 
fnto the water, a work which fatigued me very much. Aftet 
this I went every day on board, and brought away wnat 1 
eould get. 

I had been now thirteen days ashore, and had been eleyen 
times on board the ship ; in which time I had brought away 
all that one pair of hands could well be supposed capable to 
bring ; though I believe verily, had the calm weather held, 
I sho'ild have brought away the whole ship, piece by piece, 
but preparing, the twelfth time, to go on board, I found^ the 
wind began to rise : however, at low water, I went on 
board ; and though I thought I had runmiaged the cabin so 
effectually, as that nothing could be found, yet I discovered 
a locker with drawers in it, in one of which I found two or 
ihree razors, and one pair of large scissors, with some ten or 
a dozen of good knives and forks ; in another I found about 
thirty-six pounds in money, some European coin, some Bra- 
zil, some pieces of eight, some gold, and some silver. 

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money ; O drug ! 
I exclaimed, what art thou good for ? Thou art not worth 
io me, no, not the taking off the ground ; one of those 
knives is worth all this heap : I have no manner of use for 
thee ; e'en remain where thou art, and go to the bottom, as 
a creature whose life is not worth saving. However, upon 
second thoughts, I took it away ; and wrapping all this in a 
niece of canvas, I began to think of making another raft ; 
but while I was preparing this, I found the sky overcast, 
and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it 
blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently occurred to 
me, that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the 
wind off shore ; and that it was my business to be gone 
oefore the tide or flood began, or otherwise I might not be 
•ble to reach the shore at all. Accordingly I let myself 
down into the water, and swam across the channel which 
ay between the ship and the sands, and even that witk

difficulty enough, partly with the weight of the things 1 \,mi 
about me, and partly the roughnesa of the water ; for the 
wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high water it 
taew a storm. 

But I was got home to my Uttle tent, where I lay, with 
all my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all 
QuLt night, and in the morning, when I looked out, behold 
BO more ship was to be seen ! I was a little surprised, but 
lecovered myself with this satis&ctory reflection, viz., that ] 
had lost no time, nor abated no diligence, to get everything 
sut of her, that could be useful to me, and that, indeed, 
there was little left in her that I was able to bring away, il 
I had more time. 

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of 
anything out of her, except what might drive on shore, from 
her wreck ; as indeed, divers pieces of her afterwards did ; 
but those things were of small use to me. 

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing 
myself against either savages, if any should appear, or wild 
beasts, if any were in the island : and I had many thougha 
of the method how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to 
make, whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or <i 
tent upon the earth ; and, in short, I resolved upon both ; 
the manner and description of which, it may not be improper 
to give an account ot 

I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement, 
particulariy because it was upon a low, moorish ground, neai 
the sea, and I believed it would not be wholesome; and 
more particularly because there was no. fresh water near it : 
so I resolved to find a more healthy and more convenient 
spot of ground. 

I consulted several things in my situation, which 1 found 
would be proper ibr me ; first, air and fresh water, I just 
ttcw mentioned : secondly, shelter from the heat of the sun: 
dirdly, security from ravenous creatures^ whether men oc

•ea«U : fourthly, a view to the sea, that if Ood sent onj 
hip in sight, I might not lose any advantage for mj 
deliverance, of which I was not willing to hanish all my 
expectation yet. 

In search for a place proper for this, I found a little plaiD 
on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this litilr 
plain was sieep as a house-side, so that nothing could comt 
down upon me from the top. On the side of this rock. 
there was a hollow place, worn a little way in, like tht 
entrance or door of a cave ; but there was not leally any 
cave, or way into the rock, at all. 

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, 1 
resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above a 
hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay like 
a green before my door ; and, at the end of it, descended 
irregularly every way down into the low ground by the sea- 
side. It was on the N.N.W. side of the hill ; so that it 
was sheltered from the heat every day, till it came to a W. 
and by S. sun, or thereabouts, which, in those countries, in 
near the setting. 

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the 
hollow place, which took in about ten yards in its semi- 
diameter from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter, 
from its beginning and ending. 

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, 
driving them into the ground till they stood very firm like 
piles, the biggest end being out of the ground, about five 
feet and a half, and sharpened on the top. The two rowk 
did not stand above six inches from one another. 

Then I took the pieces of cable which I cut in the ihip 
and laid them in rows, one upon another, within the circle, 
between these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing 
Dther stakes in the inside, leaning against them, about two 
feet and a haJ high, like a spu* to a post ; and this fencr

w ever it. Hub cost me a great deal of time and IhImi, 
etpecially to cat the piles in the ^ mxIs, bring them to the 
olace, and drive them into the earth. 

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a door, 
imt by a short ladder to go over the top ; which ladder, 
when I was Lou I Hfted over after me ; and so I was com- 
pletely fenced in and fortified, as I thought, from all the 
world, and consequently slept secure in the night, whicli 
otherwise I could not have done ; though, as it appeared 
afterwards, there was no need of^all this caution against the 
enemies that I apprehended danger from.

Imtto this fence, or fortress, with infinite labor, I carried all 
my riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of 
which you have the account above ; and I made a large tent, 
which, to preserve me from the rains, that in one part of the 
yeai are very violent there, I made double, viz., one smaller 
tent within, and one larger tent above it, and covered the 
uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had saved among 
the sails. 

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had 
brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a 
very good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship. 

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything 
that would spoil by the wet ; and having thus endoeed all 
any goods, 1 made up the entrance, which till now I had lef. 



ROBINSON cnUSOE. »| 

•pen, and so passed and repassed, as I said, b} a thor^ 
ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the 
rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down 
out through my tent, I laid them up within my fence in the 
nature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground within about 
a foot and a half; and thus I made me a cave, just behind 
my tent, which served me like a cellar to my house. It cost 
me mdch labor and many days, before all these things were 
brought to perfection ; and therefore I must go back to some 
other things which took up some of my thoughts. At the 
same time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for the 
setting up my tent, and making the cave, that a storm of 
rain falling from a thick, dark cloud, a sudden flash of light- 
ning happened, and after that, a great clap of thunder, as is 
nat\irally the effect of it. I was not so much surprised with 
the lightning, as I was with a thought, which darted into 
my mind as swift as the lightning itself: O my powder! 
My eery heart sank within me when I thought, that at one 
blast, all my powder might be destroyed ; on which, not my 
defence only, but the providing me food, as I thought, en- 
tirely depended. I was nothing near so anxious about my 
own danger, though, had the powder taken fire, I should 
never have known who had hurt me. 

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the 
■torm was over, I laid aside all my works, my building and 
fortifying, and applied myself to make bags and boxes, tc 
separate the powder, and to keep it a little and a little in a 
parcel, in hope that whatever might come, it might not all 
take fire at once ; and to keep it so apart, that it should not 
be possible to make one part fire another. I finished this 
work in about a fortnight ; and I think my powder, which 
in all was about two hundred and forty pounds weight, was 
tiivided into not less than a hundred parcels. As to the 
•arrel t^^at had been wet, I did not apprehend any da«i(r9*

from mat ; so I placed it in my new cave, which, in my 
fkney, I called my kitchen, and the rest I hid up and down 
in holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come to it, 
marking very -carefully where I laid it. 

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out 
at least once every day with my gun, as well to divert my« 
se A as to see if I could kill anything fit for food ; and, as 
near as I could, to acquaint myself with what the island 
prodnoed. llie first time I went out, I presently discovered 
thit there were goats upon the bland, which was a great 
satisfaction to me ; but then it was attended with this mis- 
fortune to me, viz., that they were so shy, so subtle, and so 
nwift of foot, that it was the most difiicult thing in the world 
*o come at them : but I was not discouraged at this, not 
doubting but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon 
happened ; for after I had found their haunts a little, I laid 
wait in this manner for them ; I observed, if they saw me in 
the valleys, though they were upon the rocks, they would 
run away as in a terrible firight ; but if they were feeding in 
the valleys, and I was upon the rocks, they took no notice 
of me ; from whence I concluded, that by the position oi 
their optics, their sight was so directed downward, that they 
did not readily see objects that were above them : so after- 
wards, I took this method — I always climbed the rocks 
first, to get above them, and then had frequently a fair mark. 
The first shot I made among these creatures, I killed a she- 
goat, which had a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, 
whi^h grieved me heartily ; but when the old ond fell, the 
kid stood stock still by her, till I came and took her up ; 
and rot only so, but when I carried the old one witn me, 
upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my en- 
elosurs ; upon which I laid down the dam, and took the kid 
m my «irms, and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have 
bred it up tame ; but it would not eat ; so I was forced to 
kill it and eat it myself. These two supplied me with fletl

n great while, for 1 ea* sparingly, and pisaerved my 
provisions (my bread especially) as much ^£ possibly 1 
could. 

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely 
necessary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to 
bum ; and what I did for that, as also how I enlarged my 
cave, and what conveniences I made, I shall give a full 
tocount of in its proper place : but I miist first give some 
tittle account of myself, and of my thoughts about living, 
which, it may well be supposed, were not a few. 

I had a dismal prospect of my condition ; for as I was 
not C£ist away upon that island without being driven, as is 
imd, by a violent storm quite out of the course of our 
mtended voyage ; and a great way, viz., some hundreds of 
leagues, out of the ordinary course of the trade of mankind, 
I had great reason to consider it as a determination of 
Heaven, that in this desolate place, and in this desolate 
manner, I should end my life. The tears would run plenti- 
fully down my face when I made these reflections; and 
sometimes I would expostulate with myself why Providence 
should thus completely ruin its creatures, and render them 
so absolutely miserable ; so abandoned without help, so 
entirely depressed, that it could hardly be rational to be 
thankful for such a life. 

But something always returned swift upon me to check 
these thoughts, and to reprove me ; and particularly, one 
day walking with my gun in my hand, by the seaside, I 
was very pensive upon the subject of my present condition, 
when reason, as it were, expostulated with mc the othet 
way, thus : Well, you are in a desolate condition it is trae ; 
but, pray remember, where are the rest of you ? Did not 
you come eleven of you into the boat? Where are the ten? 
Why were not they saved, and you lost ? Wliy were yov 
lingled out ? Is it better to be here or there ? And thei* 
r point : \ t9 the sea. AH evils are to be considered with

the gool that b in them, and with yhat worse attendf 
them. 

Ihen it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished 
for my suhsistence, and what would have been mj case if it 
had not happened (which was a hundred thousand to one) 
that the ship floated from the place where she first struck, 
and was driven so near to the shore, that I had time tc get 
all these things out of her ; what would have been my ca^e. 
If I had been to have lived in the condition in which I at 
first came on shore, without necessaries of life, or necessaries 
to supply and procure them? Particularly, said I aloud 
(though to myself), what should I have done without a gun, 
without ammunition, without any tools to make anything, 
or to work with, without clothes, bedding, a tent, or an} 
manner of covering ? and that now I had all thes^ to a suf- 
ficient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide myself in 
such a manner as to live without my gun, when my ammu- 
cdtion was spent : so that I had a tolerable view of subsist- 
iig, without any want, as long as I lived ; for I considered, 
ffom the beginning, how I would provide for the accidents 
•hat might happen, and for the time that was to come, not 
duly after my ammunition should be spent, but even after 
my health or strength should decay. 

I confess, I had not entertained any notion of my ammu- 
nition being destroyed at one blast, I mean my powder 
being blown up by lightning ; and this made the thoughts 
of it so gurprising to me, when it lightened and thundered 
as I observed just now. 

And now being to enter into a melancholy relation of a 
scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of ja 
the world before, I shall take it from its beginning, and con- 
tinue it in its order. It was, by my account, the 30th of 
September when, in the manner as above said, I first se^ 
foot ripon this horrid island ; when the sun being to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. gfi 

OS in its autumnal equinox, was almost just over my 
Head : for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the 
latitude of nine degree** twenty-two minutes north of the 
Fine.

WA.NT OF TOOLS ^- HE ABBANOBS HIS HABITATION. 

Afteb I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came 
into my thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time 
for want of books, and pen and ink, and should even forget 
the sabbath days from the working days : but, to prevent 
this, I cut it with my knife upon a large post, in capital 
letters ; and making it into a great cross, I set it up on the 
shore where I first landed, viz., ** I came on shore here on 
the 30th of September, 1659." Upon the sides of this 
square post I cut every day a notch with my knife, and 
every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and every 
first day of the month as long again as that long one : and 
thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly 
reckoning of time. 

But it happened, that among the many things which 1 
brought out of the ship, in the several voyages which, as 
above mentioned, I made to it, I got several things of less 
valuB, but not at all less useful to me, which I found, some 
time after, in rummaging the chests : as, in particular, pens, 
Ink, and ^ paper; several parcels in the captain's, mate's 
gunner's, and carpenter's keeping ; three or four compasses, 
some mathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, 
«ud book I of navigation ; all of whi :h I huddlea together. 



16 ADVENTURB8 OP 

nrhe liier I might waiit them or no : also I found three ve? j 
good Bibles, which came to me in my cargo from England, 
fcad which 1 had packed up among my things ; some Port u- 
gese books also, and, among them, two or three popish 
prayer-books, and several other books, all which I carefully 
secured. And I must not forget, that we had in the ship a 
dog, and two cats, of whose eminent history I may ha^e 
occasion to say something, in its place : for I carried both 
the cats with me ; and tis for the dog, he jumped out of the 
ship himself, and swam on shore to me the day afler I went 
on shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me 
for many years : I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, 
nor any company that he could make up to me, 1 only 
wanted to have him talk to me, but that would not do. As 
I observed before, 1 found pens, ink, and paper, and 1 
husbanded them to the utmost ; and I shall show that while 
my ink lasted, 1 kept things very exact, but after that was 
gone, I could not ; for I could not make any ink, by any 
means that I could devise. 

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, 
notwithstanding all that I had amassed together ; and of 
these, this of ink was one ; as also a spade, pickaxe, and 
shovel, to dig or remove the earth ; needles, pins, and 
thread; as for linen, I soon learned to want that without 
much d?3iculty. 

This ^ant of tools made every work I did go on heavily : 
und it was near a whole year before I had entirely finished 
my little pale, or sui rounded my habitation. The piles oi 
stakes, which were as heavy as I could well lift, were a long 
time in cutting and preparing in the woods, and more by 
far, in bringing home ; so that I spent sometimes two days 
m cutting and bringing home one of those posts, and a third 
day in driving it into the ground ; for which purpose, I got 
a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last bethoijght mysell 
of one of tht iron crows ; which, however, though I found 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. g/ 

H answer, made dn/ing these posts or piles very laborious 
and tedious work. But what need I have been concerned 
at the tediousness cf anything I had to do ; seeing I had 
time enough to do it in ? nor had I any other employment, 
if that had been over, at lea^i that I could foresee, except 
the ranging the island to seek for food ; which I did, more 
or less, every day. 

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the 
circumstance I was reduced to ; and I drew up the state oi 
my affairs in writing, not so much to leave them to any 
that were to come after me (for I was like to have but 
few heirs), as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon 
&em, and afflicting my mind : and as my reason began now 
to master my despondency, I began to comfort myself as well 
as I could, and to set the good against the evil, that I might 
have something to distinguish my case from worse ; and I 
stated very impartially, like debtor and creditor, the comforts 
I enjoyed against the miseries I suffered, thus : 



I am cast upon a horrible, desolate But I am alive ; and not drowned,

Upoz. the wh9le, here was an unbounded testimony, that 
Q^ere was scarce any condition in tiie world so miserable, 
but there was something negative, or something positive, to 
be thankful for in it ; and let this stand as a direction, from 
the experience of the most miserable of all conditions in 
this world, that we may always find in it something to com- 
fort ourselves from, and to set, in the description of good 
and evil on the credit side of the account. 

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condi- 
tion, and given over looking out to sea, to see if I could 
spy a ship; I say, given over these things, I began to 
apply myself to accommodate my way of living, and to 
make things as easy to me as I could. 

I have already described my habitation, which was a teat 
under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of 
posts and cables ; but I might ndw rather call it a wall, for 
I raised a kind of wall against it of turfs, about two feet 
thick on the outside : and after some time (I think it was a 
year and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock. 
And thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and such 
things as I could get, to keep out the rain ; which I found 
at some times of the year, very violent. 

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into 
this pale, and into the cave which I had made behind me. 
But I must observe, too, that at first this was a confused 
hMip of goods, which, «s they lay in no order, so they tock 



ROBINSON CRUSOB gg 

■p all my place ; I had no room to turn myself : so I set 
myself to enlarge my cave, and work farther into the earth , 
for it was a loose sandy rock which yielded easily to the 
labor I bestowed on it : and when I found I was pretty safe 
as to the beasts of prey, I worked sideways, to the riglit 
hand, into the rock, and then turning to the right again, 
worked quite out, and made me a door to come out in the 
»utside of my pale or fortification. 

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were, a 
back way to my tent, and to my storehouse, but gave me 
room to stow my goods. 

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary 
things as I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a 
table ; for without these I was not able to enjoy the few 
comforts I had in the world ; I could not write, or eat, or do 
several things with so much pleasure, without a table : so J 
went to work. And here I must needs observe, that at 
reason is the substance and original of the mathematics, so 
by stating and squaring everything oy reason, and by making 
the most rational judgment of things, every man may be, in 
time, master of every mechanic art. • I had never handled a 
tool in my life ; and yet, in time, by labor, application, and 
contrivance I found at last, that I wanted nothing but 1 could 
have made, especially if I had had tools. However, I made 
abundance of things, even without tools ; and some with no 
more tools than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were 
never made that way before, and that with infinite labor. 
For example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way but 
to cut down a tree, set it on an edge before me, and hew it 
flat on either side with my axe, till I had brought it to be as 
thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth \vith my adze. 1' 
is true, by this method, I could make but one board of k 
whole tree ; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any 
liore than I had for a prodigious deal of time and laboi 
rhich it took me up to make a plank or ''::^^Brd : but my tims 
8* 



00 ADVENTURES O^ 

or laboi was ittle worth, and so it was as well employed qlm 
way as another. 

Howeyer, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed 
above, in the first place ; and this I did out of the short 
pieces of boards that I brought on my raft from the ship. 
But when I wrought out some boards, as above, I mad€ 
large shehes, of the breadth of a foot and a half, one ove? 
another, all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools 
nails, and iron work on ; and in a word, to separate every- 
thing at large in their places, that I might easily come at 
them. I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock, to hung 
my guns, and all things that would- hang up : so that had 
my €ave been seen, it looked like a general magazine of all 
necessary things ; and I had everything so ready at my hand, 
that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in 
such order, and especially to find my stock of all necessaries 
so great. 

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of every 
day's employment ; for, indeed, at first, I was in too much 
hurry, and not only as to labor, but in much discomposure ol 
mind ; and my journal would, too, have been full of many 
dull things : for example, I must have said thus — '* Sept. 
SOth. After I had got to shore, and had escaped drowning. 
Instead of being thankful to God for my deliverance, having 
first vomited, with the great quantity of salt water which 
was gotten into my stomach, and recovering myself a little, 

1 ran about the shore, wringing my hands, and beating my 
head and face, exclaiming at my misery, and crying out 1 
wac undone, undone ! till, tired and fidnt, I was forced to lie 
down on the ground to repose ; but durst not sleep, for feat 
of being lievoured." 

Some days after this, and after I had been on board th^ 
■hip, and got all that I could out of her, I coidd not forbeai 
getting up to the top of a little mountain, and looking out 
to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship : then fancy that, at a van

distance, I spied a sail, please myself with the hopes of ii, 
and, after .ooking steadily, till I was almost blind, lose it 
quite, and sit down and weep like a child, and thus increase 
my misery by my folly. 

But, having gotten over these things in some measure, and 
having settled my household stuff and habitation, made mi 
ft table and a chair, and all as handsome stuff about me as I 
could, I began to keep my journal : of which I shall heie 
give you the copy (though in it will be told all these partic« 
ulars over again) as long as it lasted ; for, having no more 
ink, I was forced to leave it off.

THE JOXTKNAL. 

Sbptembeb 30th, 1 659. I, poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, 
being shipwrecked, during a dreadful storm, in the offing, 
came on shore on this dismal unfortunate island^ which 1 
called the Island of Despair ; all the rest of the ship's 
company being drowned and myself almost dead. 

All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting myself at the 
dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz., I had neither 
food, house, clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to : acd in 
despair of any relief, saw nothing but death before me ; that 
I should either be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by 
ravages, or starved to death for want of food. At the 
approach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures { 
but slept 83undl7 though it rained all night. 



§i ADVENTUEES Or 

OcTOBEB 1. In the morning I saw, to my great snrprift# 
Cihe ship had floated with the high tide, and was driven on 
shore again much nearer the island ; which, as it was Bom« 
comfort on one hand (for seeing l^er sit upright, and not 
broken in pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get 
•n board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for 
my relief), so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the 
loss of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all staid 
on board, might haye saved the ship, or, at least, that they 
would not have been all drowned, as they were : and that^ 
had the men been saved, we might perhaps have built us a 
boat, out of the ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some 
other part of the world. I spent great part of this day in 
per^ilexing myself on these things; but, at length, seeing 
the ship almost dry, I went upon the sand as near as I could, 
and then swam on board. Thi^ay also it continued rain- 
ing, though with no wind at all. 

From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these days 
entirely spent in many several voyages to get all I could out 
of the ship ; which I brought on shore, every tide of flood, 
upon rafts. Much rain also in these days, though with some 
intervals of fair weather ; but^ it seems, this was the rainy 
season. 

Oct. 20. I overset my raft, and all the ^oods I had 
got upon it; but being in shoal water, and the things 
being chiefly heavy I recovered many of them when the tide 
was out. 

Oct. 26. It rained all night and all day, with some 
gusts of wind ; during which time the ship broke in pieces 
(the wind blowing a little harder than before) and was no 
more to be seen, extept the wreck of her, and that only at 
low water. I spen^ this day in covering and securinis th< 
goods irhich I hac saved, that the rain might not q^oL' 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9^ 

I/O*. 26. I walked about the shore almost all day, t< 
flnl out a place to fix my habitation; greatly conceraed 
to secure myself from any attack in the night, either from 
ndld be^ts or men. Towards night I fixed upon a propet 
place, under a rock, and marked out a semicircle for my 
•.iicampinent ; which I resolved to strengthen with a work, 
j^all, or fortification, made of double piles lined within with 
cables, and without with turf. 

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carrying 
ill my goods to my new habitation, though some part of the 
^Ime it rained exceedingly hard. 

The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island with 
my gun, to seek for some food, and discover the country ; 
when I killed a she-goat, and her kid followed me home, 
which I afterwards killed also, because it would not feed. 

NoYEMBEB 1. I set lip my tent under a rock, and lay 
there for the first night ; making it as large as I could, with 
stakes driven in to swing my hammock upon. 

Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the 
pieces of timber which made my rafts ; and with them 
formed a fence round me, a little within the place I had 
marked out for my fortification. 

Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls 
dke ducks, which were very good food. In the afternoon I 
went to work to make me a table. 

Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my time« oi 
work, of going out ,with my gun, time of sleep, and time 
of diversion ; viz., every morning I walked out with my gun 
for two or three hours, if it did not rain ; then employed 
myself to work till about eleven o'clock ; then ate what I 
had to live on ; and from twelve to two I lay dovni to sleep, 
the weather being excessive hot ; and then, in the evening, 
lo work again. The working part of this day and the next 
▼BA wholly employed in making my table, for I was yet but 



94 ADVENTURES OF 

a very sorry workman : though time and necessity made mi 
a complete natural mechanic soon after, as I believe they 
would any one else. 

Nov, 5. This day went abroad with my gun and dog» 
and killed a wild cat ; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh 
good for nothing : of every creature that I killed I took ofl 
the skins, and preserved them. Coming back by the sea* 
fhore, I saw many sorts of sea-fowl which I did not under- 
itand : but was surprised, and almost frightened, with two 
or three seals ; which while I was gazing at them (not well 
knowing what they were) got into the sea, and escaped me 
for that time. 

Nov. 6. After my morning walk, I went to work with 
my table again, and finished it, though not to my liking : 
nor was it long before I learned to mend it. 

Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 
7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 1 2th (for the 11th was 
Sunday, according to my reckoning), I took wholly up to 
make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolera- 
ble shape, but never to please me ; and, even in the making, 
I pulled it to pieces several times. 

Note. 1 soon neglected my keeping Sundays ; for, 
omitting my mark for them on my post, I forgot which was 
which. 

Nov. 13. This day it rained; which refreshed me 
exceedingly, and cooled the earth : but it was accompanied 
with terrible thunder and lightning, which frightened me 
flreadfully, for fear of my powder. As soon as it was over 
I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as many littie 
parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger. 

Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in making 
little square chests or boxes, which might hold about a 
pound, or two pounds at most, of powder ; and so, putting 
the powder in, I stowed it in places as secure and as remote 
from one another as possible. On one of these three days I 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ' 9|| 

killed a large bird that was good to eat; but I knew not 
what to call it. 

Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my lent, into 
the rock, to make room for my farther convenience. 

Note. Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work, 
viz., a pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket; so 
I desisted from my work, and began to consider how te 
supply these wants, and make me some tools. As for a 
pickaxe, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper 
enough, though heavy : but the next thing was a shovel or 
spade; this was so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I 
could do nothing effectually without it ; but what kind of 
one to make I knew not. 

Nov. 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I found 
ft tree of that wood, or like it, which, in the Brazils, thej 
call the iron tree, from its exceeding hardness : of this, with 
great labor, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece ; and 
brought it home, too, with difficulty enough, for it wa« 
exceeding heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and 
my having no other way, made me a long while upon this 
machine : for I worked it effectually, by little and little, 
into the form of a shovel or spade; the handle exactly 
shaped like ours in England, only that the broad part 
having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last me 
80 long : however, it served well enough for the uses which 
I had occasion to put it to ; but never was a shovel, ) 
believe, made after that fashion, or so long in making. 

I was still deficient ; for I wanted a basket or a wheel- 
barrow. A basket I could not make by any means, having 
ao such things as twigs that would bend to make wickei 
w are ; at least, none yet found out : and as to the wheel- 
barrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel, but that I 
had no notion of; neither did I know how to get about it: 
besides, I had no possible way to make iron gudgeons fo} 
ite spindle or axis of the wheel to run in; so 1 gave i over 



H ADVENTURES OF 

and, foi carrying away the earth which I dug ont of Che 
cave, I made me a thing like a hod, which the laborers canj 
mortar in for the bricklayers. This was not so difficult for 
me as the making the shovel : and yet this and the ^shovel^ 
and the attempt which I made in vain to make a wheelbar- 
10 iv, took me up no less than four days: I mean, always 
eicepting my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom 
omitted, and very seldom £siiled also bringing home some* 
thing fit to eat. 

No/. 23. My other work having now stood still, because 
of my making these tools, when they were finished I went 
on : and working every day, as my strength and time 
allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in widening and 
deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods com- 
r>odiously. 

NoTB. During all this time, I worked to make thii 
room or cave, spacious enough to accommodate me as a 
warehouse, or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a 
cellar. As for a lodging, I kept the tent : except that some- 
times, in the wet season of the year, it rained so hard that 
I could not keep myself dry ; which caused me afterwards 
to cover all my place within my pale with long poles, and in 
the form of rafters, leaning against the rock, and load them 
with flags and large leaves of trees, like a thatch. 

December 10. I began now to think my cave or vault 
finished; when on a sudden (it seems I had made it too 
Large) a great quantity of earth fell down from the top and 
one side ; so much, that, in short, it frightened me, and not 
without reason too ; for if I had been under it, I should 
never have wanted a grave-digger. Upon this disaster, I 
iiad a great deal of work to do over again, for I had the 
loose earth to carry out; and, which was of more im- 
portance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might bf 
fure no more would come down. 

Dec. 11. This day I went to work with it accordingly* 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. j^^ 

and got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with 
two pieces of board across over each post : this 1 finished 
the next day ; and setting more posts up with boards, in 
about a week more I had the roof secured ; and the posts, 
standing in rows, served me for partitions to part off my 
douse. • 

Dec. 17. From this day to the 30th, I placed shelves, 
and knocked up nails on the posts, to hang everything up 
that could be hung up: and now I began to be in some order 
within doors. 

Dec. 20. I carried everything into the cave, and began 
to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards, like 
a dresser, to order my victuals upon ; but boards began to 
be very scarce with me : also I made me another table. 

Dec. 24. Much rain all night and all day : no stirring 

)Ut. 

Dec. 25. Rain all day. 

Dec. 26. No rain ; and the earth much cooler than 
before, and pleasanter. 

Dec. 27. Killed a young goat; and lamed another, so 
that I catched it, and led it home in a string : when I had 
it home, I bound and splintered up its leg, which was broke. 

N. B. I took such care of it that it lived ; and the leg 
grew well, and as strong as ever : but, by nursing it so 
long, it grew tame, and fed upon the little green at my 
door, and would not go away. This was the first time 
that I entertained a thought of breeding Aip some tame 
creatures, that I might have food when my powder and shot 
was all spent. 

Dec 28, 29, 30, 31. Ghreat heats, and no breeze: so that 
there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food ; 
this time I spent in putting all my things in order within 
doors. 

January 1. Very hot still; but I went abroad early 
and late with my gun, and lay still in tne middle of the day. 
9 



fS ADYBNTHRBS OF 

Tbb eyening, going firther into the valleys wliich laj 
towards the centre of the island, I found there was plentj 
of goats, though exceeding shy, and hard to come at ; how 
ever, I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hupl 
thera down. Accordingly, the next day, I went out with 
^y dog, and set him upon «the goats ; but I was mistaken, 
for they all faced about upon the dog: and he knew his 
danger too well, for he would not come near them. 

Jan. 3. I began my fence or wall ; which, being still 
jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to 
mike very thick and strong. 

N. B. This wall being described before, I purposely 
omit what was said in the journal ; it is sufficient to observe 
that I was no less time than from the 3d of January to the 
14th of April, working, finishing, and perfecting this wall; 
though it was no more than about twenty-five yards in length, 
being a half circle, from one place in the rbck to another 
place, about twelve yards from it, the door of the cave being 
in the centre, behind it. 

All this time I worked very hard ; the rains hindering mu 
many days, nay, sometimes weeks together : but I thought I 
should never be perfectly secure till this wall was finished ; 
and it is scarce credible what inexpressible labor everything 
was done with, especially the bringing of piles out of the 
woods, and driving ' them into the ground ; for I made them 
much bigger than I needed to have done. 

When this 'wall was finished, and the outside double 
fenced, with a turf wall raised up close to it, I persuaded 
myself that if any people were to come on shore there they 
would not perceive anything like a habitation : and it was 
very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter, upon s 
very remarkable occasion. 

During this time, T made my rounds in the wo^ds fo* 
gdzse every day, when the rain permitted me. and made fre« 
■uent discoveries, in these walks, of something or other tt 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 9| 

my advantt^e ; particularly, I found a kind of wild pigeons 
who build, not as wood-pigeons, in a tree, but rather aa 
nouse-pigeons, in the holes of the rocks : and, taking some 
young ones, I endeavored to breed them up tame, and did 
BO ; but when they grew older, they flew all away ; which, 
perhaps, was, at first, for want of feeding them, foi* I had 
nothing to give them ; however, I frequently found their 
nosts, and got their young ones, which were very good meat. 
And now, in the managing my household aflairs, I found 
myself wanting in many things, which I thought at first it 
was impossible for me to make ; as indeed, as to some ol 
them, it was : for instance, I could never make a c$.8k to be 
hooped. I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before ; 
but I could never arrive at the capacity of making one by 
them, though I spent many weeks about it : I could neither 
put in the heads, nor join the staves so tnie'to one another 
as to make them hold water ; so I gave that also over. In 
the next place, I was at a great loss for candle ; so that as 
soon as it was dark, which was generally by seven o'clock, I 
was oblifred to go to bed. I ^member the lump of beeswax 
with whicb I made candles in my African adventure ; but I 
had none of that now : the only remedy I had was, that 
when I Lad killed a goat, I saved the tallow ; and with a 
little dich made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which 
I added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp ; and this 
gave me light, though not a clear steady light like a candle. 
In the middle of all my labors it happened, that in rummag- 
ing my things, I found a little bag ; which, as I hinted be- 
fore, had been filled with corn, for the feeding cf poultry , 
not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship 
came from Lisbon. What little remainder of corn had been 
in the bag was all devoured by the rats, and I saw nothing 
m the bag but husks and dust : and being willing to have 
:he bag for some other use (I think it was to put powder in, 
%'h«n I d Ivided it for fear of the lightni ig, or some *uc1j 



130 iU)VBNTURBS OF 

Qse), I shoDk tbe huskb of com out of it, on one side of m) 
fortification, under the rock. 

It was a little before the great rain just now mentioned, 
that I threw this stuff away ; taking no notice of anything, 
and not so mu^h as remembering that I had thrown any- 
thing there : when, about a month after, I saw some few 
stalks of fc >mething green, shooting out of the- ground, which 
I fancied might be some plant I had not seen ; but I was 
surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little 
longer time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which 
were perfect green barley, of the same kind as our European, 
nay, as our English barley. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion 
of my thoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon 
no religious foundation at all : indeed, I had yery few notions 
of religion in my head, nor had entertained any sense of any 
things that had befallen me, otherwise than as chance, or, as 
we lightly say, what pleases God : without so much as in- 
quiring into the end of Providence in these things, or his 
order in governing events in%he world. But after I saw 
wirlcy grow there, in a climate which I knew was not proper 
for com, and especially asl knew not how it came there, it 
startled me strangely ; and I began to suggest, that Ood had 
miraculously caused this grain to grow without any help of 
«ieed sown, and that it was so directed purely for my isusten- 
'\nce, on that wild miserable place. 

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out cf 
my eyes ; and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of 
natnre should happen upon my account : and this was the 
more strange to me, because I saw near it still, all along by 
the side of the rock, some other straggling stalks, which 
pi oved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had 
leen it grow in Afirica, when I was ashore there. 

I not only th >ught these the pure productions of J*rovidenc« 
ht my 9U| port, but, not doubting that there ^'as more in thf 



UOBINSON CRUSOE. l^j 

pl&ce, I went over all that part of the island where 1 had 
been before, searching in every comer, and under every rock, 
for more of it ; but I could not find any. At last it occurred 
to my thoughts, that I had shook out a bag of chicken's-meat 
in that place, and then the wonder began to cease ; and I 
must confess, my religious thankfulness to God*s providence 
began to abate too, upon the discovering that all this was 
nothing but what was common ; though I ought to have 
been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen a providence, 
as if it had been miraculous ; for it was really the work ol 
Providence, as to me, that should order or appoint that ten 
or twelve grains of com should remain unspoiled, whan the 
rats had destroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped 
from heaven ; as also, that I should throw it out in thai 
particular place, where, it being in the shade of a high rock, 
it sprang up immediately ; whereas, if I had thrown it any- 
where else, at that time, it would have been bumed up and 
destroyed. 

I carefully saved the ears of this com, you may be sure, in 
their season, which was abou^ the end of June ; and, laying 
up every com, I resolved to sow them all again ; hoping, 
in time, to have some quantity sufficient to supply me with 
bread. *B;it it was not till the fourth year that I could allow 
myself the least grain of com to eat, and even then but 
sparingly, as I shall show afterwards in its order ; for I lost 
all that I sowed the first season, by not observing the proper 
time ; as I sowed just before the dry season, so that it never 
came up at all, at least not as it would have done ; of which 
in its place. 

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty . 
stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care ; and 
whose use was of ijie satne kind, or to the same purpose, viz., 
to make me bread, or rather food ; for I found ways tc cook 
»t up without baking, though I did that also after some tim«

102 ADVENTURES OF 

I woiked excessively hard these three or four monias, Jl 
get my wall done ; and the 14th of April J closed it up : con- 
triving to get into it, not by a door, but over the wall, by a 
ladder, that there might be no sign on the outside of my 
habitation. 

ApbiIi 16. I finished the ladder ; so I went up with the 
ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it 
down in the inside : this was a complete enclosure to me ; 
lor within I had room enough, and nothing could come 
at me from without, unless it could first mount my wall. 

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had 
almost all my labor oyerthrown at once, and myself killed ; 
the case was thus : — As I was busy in the inside of it 
behind my tent, just at the entrance into my cave, I was 
terribly firightened with a most dreadful surprising thing 
indeed; for, all on a sudden, I found the earth come 
crumbling down from the roof of my cave, and from the 
edge of the hill over my head, and two of the posts I had 
•et up in the cave cracked in a frightful manner. I was 
heartily scared ; but thought nothing of what really was the 
cause, only thinking that the top of my cave was falling in, 
as some of it had done before ; and for fear I should be 
buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not thinking 
myself safe there neither, I got over my wall for fear of the 
pieces of the hill which I expected might roll down upon me. 
I had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground, than I 
plainly paw it was a terrible earthquake : for the ground I . 
stocd on shook three times at about eight minutes' distance^ 
with three such shocks as would have overturned the strong- 
.est building that could be supposed to have stood on the 
earth ; and a great piece of the top of a rock, which stood 
about a half a mile from me, next the sea, fell down with 
lu^h a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life. I per- 
^ Yed also that the very sea was put into a violent mf Jtioi 



ROBINSON CRUSOB 109 

07 it; and I believe the shocks were stronger under the 
water than on the island. 

I was so much amazed with the thing itself (having neve! 
fdt the like, nor discoursed with any one that had) that I 
was like one dead or stupified ; and the motion of the earth 
made my stomach sick, like one that was tossed at sea : but 
the noise of the falling of the rock awaked me, as it weie ; 
and rousing me from the stupified condition I was in, filled 
me with horror, and I thought of nothing but the hill falling 
upon my tent and myjiousehold goods, and burying all at 
once ; this sunk my very soul within mc a second time. 

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for 
some time, I began to take courage ; yet I had not heart 
enough to' go over my wall again, for fear of being buried 
alive ; but sat still upon the ground greatly cast down, and 
disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All this while I had 
not the least serious religious thought ; nothing but the 
common Lord^ have mercy upon me ! and when it was over 
that went away too. 

"While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy, 
as if it would rain ; and soon after the wind rose by a little 
and little, so that in less than half an hour, it blew a most 
dreadful hurricane: the sea was, all on a sudden, covered 
with foam and froth ; the shore was covered with a breach of 
the water ; the trees were torn up by the roots ; and a terri- 
ble storm it was. This held about three hours, and then 
began to abate ; and hi two hours more it was quite calm, 
and began to rain very hard. All this while I sat upon the 
ground, very much terrified and dejected : vhen, on a sudden, 
it came into my thoughts that these winds and rain being the 
conesquence of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was 
ipent and over, and I might venture into my cave again. 
With this thought my spirits began to revive ; and the raia 
ilsc helping to persuade me, 1 went in, and sat down in m}

tent ; but the rain was so violent, that my tent was teadj to 
be beaten down with it ; and I was forced to get into mj 
caie, though very much afraid aid uneasy, for fear it should 
fall on my head. This yiolent rain forced me to a new work, 
?iz., to cut a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, 
to let the water go out, which would else have drowned my 
cave. After I had been in my cave for some time, and found 
no more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be mote 
composed. And now, to support my spirits, which indeed 
wanted it very much, I went to my little store, and took a 
small cup of rum ; which, however, I did then, and always, 
very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when that was 
gone. It continued raining all that night and great part of 
the next day, so that I could not stir abroad : but my mind 
being more composed, I began to think of what I had best 
do ; concluding, that if the island was subject to these 
earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a cave, but 
I must consider of building me some little hut in an open 
place, which I might surround with a wall, as I had done 
here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts or men : 
for if I staid where I was, I should certainly, one time or 
other, be buried alive. 

With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from 
the place where it now stood, being just under the hanging 
precipice of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken 
again, would certainly fall upon my tent. I spent the two 
next days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving 
where and how to remove my habitation. The fear of being 
swallowed alive affected me so, that I never slept in quiet ; 
and yet the apprehension of lying abroad, without any fence, 
was almost equal to it : but still, when I looked ^bout, and 
4aw how everything was put in order, how pleasantly I was 
concealed, and how safe from danger, it made me very loath 
to renove. In the mean time, it occurred to me that it 
would require a vast deal of time for me to do this ; ind 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. Jo^ 

diat 1 must be contented to run the risk where I was, ill 1 
had formed a convenient camp, and secured it so lb to 
remove to it. With this conclusion I composed myself fo« 
6 time ; and resolved that I would go to work with all speed 
10 build me a wall with piles and cables, dLC, in a circle as 
before, and set up my tent ii^ it when it was finished ; but 
tliat I would venture to stay where I was till it was ready, 
and fit to remove to. This was the 21st. 

April 22. The next morning I began to consider ol 
means to put this measure into execution; but I was at a 
great loss about the tools. I had three large axes, and 
abundance of hatchets (for we carried the hatchets for traffic 
with the Indians) ; but with much chopping and cutting 
knotty hard wood, they were all full of notches, and dull : 
und though I had a grindstone, I could not turn it and grind 
my tools too. This caused me as much thought as a states- 
man would have bestowed upon a grand point of politics, or 
a judge upon the life and death of a man. At length 1 
contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that 
1 might have both my hands at liberty. 

Note. I had never seen any such thing in England, or 
at least not to take notice how it was done, though since I 
have observed it is very common there : besides that, my 
grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine cost 
me a full week's work to bring it to perfection. 

April 28, 29. These two whole days I took iip ui 
grinding my tools, my machine for turning my grindstone 
performing very well. 

April 30. Having perceived that my bread had been 
low a great while, I now took a survey of it and reduced 
myself to one biscuit-cake a day, which made mj heart ^ery 
liOftvy.

AND AFFLICTION. 

Mjlt 1. In the morning, looking towards the seaside, th« 
tide being low, 1 saw something lie on the shore bigger than 
ordinary, and it looked like a cask : when I came to it, ] 
found a small bairel, and two or three pieces of the wreck 
of the ship, which were driven on shore by the late hurri- 
cane; and looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it 
seemed to lie higher out of the water than it used to do. 1 
examined the barrel that was driven on shore, and soon 
found it was a barrel of gunpowder ; but it had taken water, 
and the powder was caked as hard as a stone : however, 1 
rolled it farther on the shore for the present, and went on 
upon the sands, as near as I coUld to the wreck of the ship, 
to look for more. 

When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely 
removed. The fbrecastle, which lay before buried in the 
sand, was heaved up at least six feet ; and the stem (which 
was broke to pieces, and parted from the rest, by the force 
of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging of her) wad 
tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one side : and the sand 
was thrown so high on that side next her stem, that I could 
now walk quite up to her when the tide was out ; whereas 
there was a great piece of water before, so that I could not 
come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swim- 
ming. I was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded 
iK must be done by the earthquake ; and as by this violence 
the ship was more broken open than formerly, so man^ 
things came daily on shore, which the sea had loosened, and 
which the winds and water rolled by degrees to the land. 



ROBINSON CtlUSOE. 107 

This wholly diverted my thoughts tiom the design o« 
lemoving my habitation ; and I busied myself mightily, that 
day especially, in searching whether 1 could make any way 
hito the ship : but I found nothing ysras to be expected of 
that kind, for all the inside of the ship was choked up with 
■and. However, as I had learned not to despair of any- 
thing, I resolved to pull everything to pieces that I could 
out of the ship, concluding that everything I could get from 
her would be of some use or other to me. 

May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam 
through, whic^ I thought held some of the upper part or 
quarter-deck together; and when I had cut it through, 1 
cleared away the sand as well as I could from the side 
which lay highest ; but the tide coming in, I was obliged 
to give over for that time. 

Mat 4. I went a fishing, but caught not one fish that 
I durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when, just 
going to leave ofi*, I caught a young dolphin. I had made 
me a long line of some rope-yarn, but I had no hooks ; yet 
I frequently caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; 
all which I dried in the sun, and ate them dry. 

May 5. Worked on the wreck : cut another beam asunder, 
and brought three great fir planks off firom the decks, which 
I tied together, and made swim on shore when the tide of 
flood came on. 

May 6. Worked on the wreck : got several iron bolts 
out of her, and other pieces of iron work: worked very 
hard, and came home very much tired, and had tho igLts ol 
giving it over. 

May 7. Went to the wreck again, but not \\ith an intent 
to work; but found the weight of the wreck had broke 
itself down, the beams being cut ; that several pieces of the 
•hip seemed to lie loose ; and the inside of the hold lay so 
open that I could «ee into it ; but almost full of water an<) 
land.

May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an ron crow 
to wiench up the deck, which lay now quite claar of thi 
water and sand. 1 wrenched up two planks, and brought 
them on shore also with the tide. I left the iron crow in 
the wreck for next day. 

May 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow made 
way into the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and 
locsened them with ^e crow, but could not break them up 
I felt also a roll of English lead, and coidd stir it; but i 
was too heavy to remove. 

May 10 to 14. Went every day to the wreck, and got h 
great many pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and two 
or three hundred weight of iron. 

May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut 
a piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one 
hatchet, and driving it with the other ; but as it lay about a 
foot and a half in tne water, I could not make any blow to 
drive the hatchet. 

May 16. It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck 
appeared more broken by the force of the water; but I 
stayed so long in the v/oods, to get pigeons for food, that 
the tide prevented my going to the wreck that day. 

May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, 
at a great distance, two miles off me, but resolv-ed to see 
what they were, and found it was a piece of the head, but 
too heavy for me to bring away. 

May 24. Every day, to this day, I worked on the wreck ; 
and with hard labor I loosened some tnings so much, wit) 
the crow, that the first blowing tide several casks fioated 
out, and two of the seamen's chests : out the wind blowing 
from the shore, nothing came to land that day but pieces o 
timber, and a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it ; 
out the salt water and the sand had spoiled it. I continued 
this work e\ery day to the 15 th of June, except the time 
McoMary to get food ; which I always appoii ted, during 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 101 

UiiB part of my employment, to be when the U.^ e waa up< 
that I might be ready when it was ebbed out ; and by this 
time I had gotten timber, and plank, and iron \%ork, enough 
to have built a good boat, if I had known how : and I also 
got, at several times, and in several places, near one hundred 
weight of the sheet-lead. 

June 16. Going down to the seaside, I foimd a large 
tortoise, or turtle. This was the first I had seen ; which, it 
.*.ecmb» was only my misfortune, not any defect of the place, 
• I scarcity ; for had I happened to be on the other side of 
thf island, I might have had hundreds of them every day, 
as 1 found afterwards ; but perhaps had paid, dear enough 
for them. 

June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her 
three-score eggs : and her flesh was to me, at that time, the 
most savory and pleasant that 1 ever tasted in my life : 
having had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I landed 
in this horrid place. ^ 

June 18. Rained all that day, and I stayed within. I 
thought, at this time, the rain felt cold, and I was somewhat 
chilly ; which I knew was not unusual in^hat latitude. 

JuNB 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had 
been cold. 

June 20. No rest all night ; violent pains in my head^ 
and feverish. 

Junk 21. Very ill; frightened almost to death with the 
apprehensions of my sad condition, to be sick, and no help *.

coiiinsed.

dions of sickness. 

June 23. Very bad again ; cold and shivering, and thee

June 24. Much better. 



1 10 ADVENTURES OF 

June 25. An ague very violent : the fit held rai sevea 
hours ; cold fit, and hot, with faint sweats after.it. 

June 26. Better ; and having no victuals to eat, took 
my gun, but found myself very weak : however, I killed a 
sho'goat, aod with much difficulty got it home, and broiled 
some of it, and ate. I would fain have stewed it, and made 
some broth, but had no pot. 

June 27. The ague again so violent that I lay a-bed all 
day, and neither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for 
thirst ; but so weak, I had not strength to stand up, or to 
get myself any water to drink. Prayed to Ood again, but 
was light-headed ; and when 1 was not, I was so ignorant 
that I knew not what to say : only lay and cried. Lord, look 
upon me ! Lord, pity me ! Lord, have mercy upon me ! I 
suppose I did nothing else for two or three hours ; till the 
fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till &r in the 
night. When I awoke, 1 found myself much refreshed, but 
weak, and exceeding thirsty : however, as I had no watei in 
my who]e habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and 
went to sleep again. In this second sleep I had this terrible 
dream : I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the 
outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew after 
the earthquake, and that I saw a man, descend from a great 
black cloud, in a bright fiame of fire, and light upon the 
ground : he was all over as bright as a flame, so that I could 
but just bear to look towards him : his countenance was in- 
expressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe : when 
he stepped upon the ground with his feet, I thought the 
earth trembled, just as it had done before in the earthquake ,' 
and all the air looked, to my apprehension, as if it had been 
^lled with flashes of fire. He had no sooner landed upon 
the earth, but he moved forward towards me, with a long 
ipear or weapon in his hand, to kill me ; and when he came 
iu a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me, or ] 
lUaid a voice so terrible that it ii impossible to express the 



HOBINSdN CJIUSOE. HJ 

%tTroT of it ; all that 1 c«.n say I understood, was this 
Seeing all these things have not brought thee to repentance 
now thou shalt die ; at which words, I thought he lifted up 
the spear that was in his hand, to kill me. 

No one that shall ever read this account, will expect that 
I should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this 
terrible vision ; I mean, that even while it was a dream, 1 
even dreamed of those horrors ; nor is it any more possible 
to describe the impression that remained upon my mind when 
T awaked, and found it was but a dream. 

I had, alas ! no divine knowledge : what I had recei\ eJ 
by the good instruction of my father was then worn out, by 
an uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafaring wick- 
edness, and a constant conversation with none but such ap 
were, like myself, wicked and profane to the last degree. 
I do not remember that I had, in all that time, one thought 
that so much as tended either to looking upward towards 
God, or inward tOAvards a reflection upon my own ways ; but 
a certain stupidity of soul, withv^ut desire of good, or con- 
Bciousness of evil, had entirely overwhelmed me ; and I was 
all that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked creature 
among our common sailors, can be supposed to be ; not 
having the least sense, either of the fear of God, in danger, 
or of thankfulness to him, in deliverances. 

In the relating what is already part of my story, this will 
be the more easily believed, when I shall add, that through 
ill the variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me, I 
never had so much as one thought of its being the hand oi 
God, or that it was a just punishment for my sin ; either my 
rebellious behaviour against my father, or my present sins, 
which were great ; or even as punishment for the general 
course of my wicked life. When I was on the desperate 
expedition on the desert shores of Africa, I never had sc 
much as one thought of what would become of me ; or on« 
■rish to God to direct me, whither I should go, or to ke^p 



1 12 ADVENTUllES OF 

me from the danger which appaiently surroiLided me, as wel 
from yoraciou9 creatures as cruel savages : but 1 was quite 
thoughtless of a Ood or a Providence ; acted like a mere 
'brute, from the principles of nature, and by the dictates oi 
common sense only ; and indeed hardly that. When I was 
delivered and taken up at sea by the Portuguese captain, 
well used, and dealt with justly, and honorably, as well a« 
charitably, I had not the least thankfulness in my thoughts. 
When, again, I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger ol 
drowning, on this island, I was as fax from remorse, or look- 
ing on it as a judgment ; I only said to myself often, that 7 
was an unfortunate dog, and bom to be always miserable. 

It is true, when I first got on shore here, and found all my 
ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised 
with a kind of ecstacy, and some transports of soul, which, 
had the grace of Qod assisted, might have come up to true 
thankfulness : but it ended where it began, in a mere com- 
mor flight of joy : or, as I may say, being glad I was alive, 
without the least reflection upon the distinguished goodness 
of the hand which had preserved me, and had singled me 
out to be preserved when all the rest were destroyed, or any 
inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to me : just 
the S€une common sort of joy which seamen generally have, 
after they are got safe ashore from a shipwreck ; which they 
drown all in the next bowl of punch, and forget almost as 
soon as it is over : and all the rest pf my life was like it. 
Even when I was, afterwards, on due consideration, made 
f cnsible of my condition, — how I was cast on this dreadful 
place, out of the reach of human kind, out of all hope oi 
relief, or prospect of redemption, — as soon as I saw but a 
prospect of living, and that I should not starve and perish 
for hunger, all the sense of my affliction wore ofl*, and I 
began to be very easy, applied myself to the works propel 
for my preservation and supply, and was &r enough from 
being afflicted at my condition, as a judgment from Heaven.

•r as the hand of God against me ; these weie the ugh U 
which very seldom entered into my head. 

The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in ray Journal, 
had, at first, some little influence upon me, and begun to 
afifect me with seriousness, as long as I thought it had some- 
thing miraculous in it; but as soon as that part of the 
thought was removed, all the impression which was raised 
from it wore off also, as I have noted already. Even the 
earthquake, though nothing could be more terrible in ita 
nature, or more immediately directing to the invisible Powei 
which alone directs such things, yet no sooner was the fright 
over, but the impression it had made went off also. I had 
no more sense of God, or his judgments, much less of the 
present affliction of my circumstances being from his hand, 
than if I had been in the most prosperous condition of life. 
But now, when 1 began to be sick, and a leisure view of the 
miseries of death came to place itself before me ; when my 
spirits began to sink under the burden of a strong distemper, 
and nature was exhausted with the violence of the fever ; 
eonscience, that had slept so long, began to awake ; and I 
reproached myself with my past life, in which I had so 
evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the justice 
of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to deal with 
me in so vindictive a manner. These reflections oppressed 
me for the second or third day of my distemper; and, in 
the violence as well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches 
of my Conscience, extorted from me some words like praying 
to God : though I cannot say it was a prayer attended either 
with desires or with hopes ; it was rather the voice of mere 
fright and distress. My thoughts were confused ; the con- 
victions great upon my mind ; and the horror of dying in 
Bach a miserable condition, raised vapors in my head with 
the mere apprehension : and, in these hurries of my soul, I 
knrw not what my tongue might express ; but it was rathej 
•xclamanon, such as. Lord, what a miserable creature am I

If I she lid be dick, I shall certainly die for w«nt of help ; 
and what will become of me ? Then the tears biirst out ct 
my eyes, and I could say no more for a good while. In thid 
*nterval, the good advice of my father came to my mind, and 
presently his prediction, which I mentioned at the begiuiing 
'jf this story, viz., that if I did tpkc this foolish step, God 
woulJ not bless me; and I shcj'i' have leisure hereafter to 
reflect upon having neglected i-j'. counsel, when there might 
b3 none to assist in my ifxjy^ry. Now, said 1, aloud, my 
dear father's words are com? to pass: God's justice has 
overtaken me, and I l.^-^e none to help or hear me. 1 
rejected the voice of P*f>vidence, which had mercifully put 
me in a station of life \/herein I might have been happy and 
easy; but I would neitaer see it myself, noi learn from my 
parents to know the bL^sing of it. I left ch^^ni co mourn

would have pushed me in the world, a jd would have made 
everything easy to me ; and now I have difficulties to 
struggle with, too great for even nature itself to support; 
and no assistance, no comfort, no advice. Then 1 cried out, 
Lord, be my help, for I am in great distiess. This was th« 
ftrsi prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for man)

/UNE 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep 
I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I got up; and 
though the fright and terror of my dream was very great, 
yet I considered that the fit of the ague would return again 
the next day, and now was my time to get something to 
refresh and support myself when I shoidd be ill. The first 
thing I did was to fill a large square case-bottle with water, 
and set it upon my table, in reach of my bed : and to take 
off the chill or agueish disposition of the water, I put about 
a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and mixed them together. 
Then I got me a piece of the goat's fiesh, and broiled it on 
the coals, but could eat very little. I walked about; but 
was very weak, and withal very sad and heavy-hearted in 
the sense of my miserable condition, dreading the return of 
my distemper the next day. At night, 1 made my supper 
of three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, an I 
ate, as we call it, in the shell : and this was the first bit oi 
meat I had ever asked God's blessing to, as I could remem 
ber, in my whole life. After J had eaten, I tried to wdk , 
but found myself so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun 
(for I never went out without that) ; so 1 went but a little 
way, and sat down upon the ground, looking out upon the 
sea, which was just before me, and very calm and smooth. 
As I sat here, some such thoughts as these occurred tu 
me : What is this earth and sea, of which I have seen sc 
much? Whence is it produced? And what am I, and all 
Che other creatures^ wild and tame, human and brutal^ 



lie Al^VENTDKES OF 

Whence are >«re? Surely, we are all made by some *ecrel 
power, who formed the earth and sea, the air and sky. And 
who is that ? Then it followed most naturally, It is God 
that has made all. Well, but then, it came on, if God had 
made all these things, he giiides and governs them all, and 
all things that concern them ; for the power that could make 
all things, must certainly have power to guide and direct 
them: if so, nothing can happen in the great circuit ol 
his works, either without his knowledge or appointment. 

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he knows 
that I am here, and am in this dreadful, condition : and 11 
nothing happens without his appointment, he has appointed 
all this to befal me. Nothing occurred to my thought, to 
contradict any of these conclusions ; and therefore it rested 
upon me with the greatest force, that it must needs be that 
God had appointed all this to befal me ; that 1 was brought 
to this miserable circumstance by his direction, he having 
the sole power, not of me only, but of everything that hap- 
pens in the world. Immediately it followed. Why has God 
done this to me ? What have I done to be thus used ? My 
conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had 
blasphemed : and methought it spoke to me like a voice ! 
Wretch, dost thou ask what thou hast done ? Look back 
upon a dreadful misspent life, and ask thyself what thou hast 
not done ? Ask, why is it that thou wert not long ago 
destroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth 
Roads; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the 
Sallee man-of-war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast 
af Africa ; or drowned Aere, when all the crew perished but 
thyself? Dost thou ask what thou hast done ? I was struclt 
dumb with these reflections, as one astonished, and had not 
a woird to say ; no, not to answer to myself; and, rising up 
pensive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went ovei 
my wall, as if I had been going to bed : but my thoughts 
were ladly disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep ; bq* 



ROBINSON CRUSOK. 117 

I sat down in the chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began 
to be dark. Now, as the apprehension of the return of my 
distemper terrified me very much, it occurred to my thought, 
that the Brazilians take no. physic but their tobacco fof 
almost all distempers ; and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco 
in one of the ohests, which was quite cured ; and some also 
that was green, and not quite cured. 

I w9-it, directed by Heaven, no doubt ; for in this chest I 
4>und a cure both for soul and body. I opened the chest, 
and found what 1 looked for, viz., the tobacco; and as the 
few books I had saved lay there too, I took out one of the 
Bibles which I mentioned before, and which, to this time, I 
had not found leisure or so much as inclination, to look into. 
I say, I took it out, and brought both that and the tobacco 
with me to the table. What use to make of the tobacco I 
knew not, 'as to my distemper, nor whether it was good for 
.t or not; but I tried several experiments with it, as if 1 was 
resolved it should hit one way or other. I first took a piece 
of the leaf, and chewed it in my mouth ; which, indeed, at 
lirst, almost stupified my brain ; the tobacco being green 
jind strong, and such as I had not been much used to. Then 
[ took some and steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and 
resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down : and lastly, I 
oumt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close 
aver the smoke of it as long as I could bear it ; as well for 
*he heat, as almost for suffocation. In the interval of this 
operation, I took up the Bible, and began to read ; but my 
lead was too much disturbed by the tobacco to bear reading, 
it hast at that time ; only, having opened the book casually, 
the first words that occurred to me were these : '* Call on 
me in the day of troul)le, and I will deliver thee, and thou 
•halt glorify me." These words were very apt to my case : 
and made some impression upon my thoughts at the time o1 
reading them, though not so much as they did afterwardi ; 
'or, as for being delivered^ the word had no sound, %h I m*)

•ay, to me ; the thing was so remote, so imposs tie in m} 
apprehension of things, thit, as the children of Israel said 
•vhen they were promised flesh to eat, ** Can God spread a 
table in the wilderness ? " so I began to say, Can even God 
himself deliver me from this place ? And as it was not foi 
many years that any hopes appeared, this prevailed very 
often upon my thoughts : but, however, the words made a 
great impression upon me, and I mused upon them very 
often. It now grew late : and the tobacco had, as I said, 
dozed my head so much, that I inclined to sleep : so I left 
my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want anything 
in the night, and went to bed. But before I lay down, I 
did what I never had done in all my life ; I kneeled down, 
and prayed to Qod to fulfil the promise to me, that if I called 
upon him in the day of trouble, he would deliver me. After 
my broken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum 
in which I had steeped the tobacco ; which was so strong 
and rank of the tobacco, that indeed 1 could scarce get it 
down; immediately upon this I went to bed. I found 
presently the rum flew up into my head violently ; but I fell 
into a sound sleep, and waked no more till, by the sun, it 
must necessarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon the 
next day ; nay, to this hour, I am partly of opinion, that 1 
slept all the next day and night, and till almost three the 
day after ; for otherwise, I know not how I should lose a 
day out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it 
appeared some years after I had done ; for if I had lost it 
by crossing and recrossing the Line, I should have lost more 
than one day ; but certainly I lost a day in my account, and 
never knew which way. Be that, however, one way or the 
ol^er, when I awctked I found myself %xceedingly refreshed, 
and my spirits lively and cheerful: when I got up I wii 
stronger than I was the day before, and my stomach better 
fbt I was hungry : and, in short, I had no flt the next day

but coDtinued much altered for the better. This ^aa th« 
29th. 

The 30th was my well day, of course ; and I went abroad 
with my gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed 9 
sea-fowl or two, something like a brand goose, and brought 
them home ; but was not very forw^^rd to eat them ; so I ato 
some more of the turtle's eggs, which were very good. This 
tjvening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did 
me good the day before, viz., the tobacco steeped in rum ; 
only I did not take so much as before, nor did I chew any 
of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke ; however, I 
was not so well the next day, which was the 1st of July, as 
I hoped I should have been ; for I had a little of the cold fit, 
but it was not much. 

July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways ; and 
dosed myself with it as at first, and doubled the quantity 
which I drank. 

July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though I did 
not recover my full strength for some weeks after. While I 
was thus .gathering strength, my thoughts ran exceedingly 
upon this Scripture, " I will deliver thee ; " and the impos- 
sibility of my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar ol 
my ever expecting it : but as I was dicouraging myself with 
such thoughts, it occurred to my mind that I pored so much 
upon my deliverance from the main affliction, that I dis- 
regarded the deliverance I had received ; and I was, as it 
were, made to ask myself such questions as these, viz., 
Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully, too, from sick* 
ness ; from the most distressed condition that could be 
urd that was so frightful to me ? and what notice have 1 
taken of it ^ Have I done my part ? God has delivered 
me, but I have not glorified him ; that is to say, I have not 
owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance : anf 
ik*aw can I expect a greater deliverance ? This touched in| 



I2ii AJ)\ENTUUES OF 

neart very much ; and immediately I knelt down, and gar* 
(lod thankg aloud for my recovery from my sickness. 

JvLT 4. In the morning I took the Bible : and begin- 
ning at the New Testament, I began seriously to read it : 
and imposed upon myself to read a while every morning and 
every night ; not bindingjnyself to the number of chapters, 
Imt as long as my thoughts should engage me. It was not 
long after I set seriously to this work, that I found my 
b jart more deeply and sincerely affected with the wickod- 
c CSS of my past life. The impression of my dream revived ; 
Hiid the words. All these things have not brought thee to 
/'pentance, ran seriously in my thoughts. I was earnestly 
begging of God to give me repentance, when it happened 
providentially, the very same day, that, reading the scrip- 
ture, I came to these words, " He is exalted a Prince and a 
Saviour; to give repentance and to give remission." I 
threw down the book ; and with my heart as well as my 
hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of joy, 1 
cried out aloud, Jesus, thou son of David ! Jesus, thou 
exulted Prince and Saviour ! give me repentance ! This was 
the first time in all my life I could say, in the true sense of 
the words, that I prayed ; for now I prayed with a sense of 
my condition, and with a true scripture view of hope, 
foun<l(!d on the encouragement of the word of God : and 
from this time, I may say, I began to have hope that God 
wo til d hear me. 

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, 
** Call on me, and I will deliver thee," in a different sense 
from what I had ever done before ; for then I had no notion 
af anything being called deliverance^ but mj being delivered 
from the captivity I was in ; for though 1 was indeed at 
large in the place, yet the island was certainly a prison t^ 
me, and that in the worst sense in Ihe world But now 1 
loarncd to take it in another sense ; now I looked back upon 
my past life with such horror, and my sins appeared M 



Robinson ckusoe. 12 

ireadful, ttiat my soul sought nothing ot God but delivei 
ance from the load of guilt that bore down all my comfort 
As for my solitary life, it was nothing ; I did not so mud 
OS pray to be delivered from it, or think of it ; it was all o* 
uo consideration, in comparison with this. ^ And I add thit* 
part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever 
they come to a true sense of things, they will find deliverance 
from sin a much greater blessing than deliverance fronr 
affliction. 

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable 
as to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind : and 
my thoughts being directed, by constantly reading the 
scripture and praying to God, to things of a higher nature, I 
had a great deal of comfort within, which, till now, I knew 
nothing of; also, as my health and strength returned, 1 
bestirred me to furnish myself with everything that 1 
wanted, and make my way of living as regular as I coidd. 

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employed 
In walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a 
little at a time, as a man that was gathering up hb strength 
after a fit of sickness ; for it is hardly to be imagined how 
low I was, and to what weakness I was reduced. The 
application which I made use of was perfectly new, and 
perhaps what had never cured an ague before : neither can I 
recommend it to any one to practise, by this experiment; 
and though it did carry off* the fit, yet it rather contributed 
to weakening me; for I had frequent convulsions in my 
nerves and limbs for some time : I learned from it also this, 
in particular ; that being abroad in the rainy season was the 
most pernicious thing to my health that could be, especially 
n those rains which came attended with storms and hurri- 
canes of wind ; for as the rain which came in the dry season 
was almost always accompanied with such storms, so I found 
that this rain was much more dangerous than the rain which 
Cell in September and October. 
\ 



l32 ADYBNTURBS OF 

I liai now been in this unhappy island above ten montlui 
fell possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed t 
be entirely taken from me ; and I firmly believed that ni 
human shape had ever set foot upon that place. Having 
secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had 
ft great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island, 
tnd to see what other productions I might find, which I yet 
knew nothing of. 

It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a mort 
particular survey of the island itself. I went up the creel 
first, where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. ) 
found, after I came about two miles up, that the tide did not 
flow any higher ; and that it was no more than a little brook 
of running water, very fresh and good : but this being the 
dry season, there was hardly any water in some parts of it ; 
at least, not any stream. On the banks of this brook I 
found many pleasant savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth^ 
and covered with grass ; and on the rising parts of them, 
next to the higher grounds (where the water, as it might b« 
supposed, never overflowed), I found a great deal of tobacco, 
green, and growing to a very great and strong stalk : and 
there were divers other plants, which I had no knowledge o( 
or understanding about, and that might, perhaps, have 
virtues of their own, which I coiild not find out. I searched 
for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that climate, 
mi J^e their bread of; but I could find none. I saw large 
plants of aloes, but did not understand them. I saw several 
iugar-»nes, but ^dld ; and, for want of cultivation, imper- 
fect I contented myself with these discoveries for this 
time ; and came back, musing with myself what course 1 
might take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the 
fruits or plants which I should discover ; but could bring it 
to no conclusion ; for, in short, I had made so little observe* 
laoii while I was in the Brazils, that I knew little of ftf 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. |a| 

piaats iu the field ; at least, very little that might setve m« 
to any purpose now in my distress. 

The next day, the 1 6th, I went up the same way again ; 
And after going something farther than 1 had gone the day 
before, 1 found the brook and the savannahs begin to cease, 
and the country became more woody than before. In thif 
part I found different fruits ; and particularly I found melcmi 
upon the ground in great abundance, and grapes upon the 
trees ; the vines, indeed, had spread over the trees, and 
the clusters of grapes were now just in their prime, very 
ripe and rich. This was a surprising discovery, and I was 
exceedingly glad of them, but I was warned by my experi- 
ence to eat sparingly of them ; remembering that when I 
was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed several o* 
our Englishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing them 
into fluxes and fevers. I found, however, an excellent use 
for these grapes ; and that was to cure or dry them in the 
sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept; 
which I thought would be (as indeed they were) as whole- 
some and as agreeable to eat, when no grapes were to be 
had. 

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my 
habitation ; which, by the way, was the first night, as I 
might say, I had lain from home. At night, I took my first 
contrivance, and got up into a tree, where I slept well ; and 
the next morning proceeded on my disBl^ery, travelling near 
four miles, as I might judge by the length of the valley ; 
keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south 
and north sides of me. At the end of this march I came 
to an opening, where the country seemed to descend to the 
west ; and a little spring of fresh water, which issued o'it at 
the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that is, due 
east ; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, so 
6ourishing, everything being in a constant verduro, oi 



124 ADVENTURES OF 

flourish of spring, that it looked like a planted garde i. f 
descended a little on the side of that delicious vale, surve j- 
ing it with a secret kind of pleasure (though mixed wtth 
other afflicting thoughts), to think that this was all my own; 
that I was king and lord of all this country indefeasibly, 
and had a right of possession ; and, if I could convey it, 
I might have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a 
manor in England. I saw here abundance of cocca-trees^ 
and orange, lemon, and citron trees, but all wild, and very 
lew bearing any fruit ; at least not then. However, the 
green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, 
but very wholesome ; and I mixed their juice afterwards 
with water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool 
and refreshing. I found now I had business enough, to 
gather and carry home ; and I resolved to lay up a store, as 
well of grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the 
wet season, which I knew was approaching. In order to 
this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one place,' a lesser 
beap in another place ; and a great parcel of limes and 
lemons iu another place ; and taking a few of each with me, 
I travelled homeward ; and resolved to come again, and 
bring a bag or sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest 
borne. Accordingly, having spent three days in this jour- 
ney, I came home (so I must now call my tent and ray cave) : 
but before I got thither, the grapes were spoiled ; the rich- 
ness of the fruits, and the weight of the juice, having 
broken and bruised them, they were good for little or. 
Dothing : as to the limes, they were good, but I could bring 
only a few. 

The next day being the 19th, I went back, having made 
me iwo small bags to bring home my harvest; bit I was 
torprised, when coming to my heap of grapes, vrhich were 
10 riclT and fine when I gathered them, I found them all 
spread about, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some aere^ 
iome ^h(^ri\ and abimdance eaten and devoured. By this 1 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 12| 

coAcluded there were some wild creatures thereabouts which 
had done this, but what they were I knew not. However, 
as I found there was no laying them up in heaps, and no 
carrpng them away in a sack ; but that one way they would 
be destroyed, and the other way they would be rrished 
with their own weight ; I took another course : I then 
gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon 
the out>branches of the trees, that they might cure and dry 
in the sun ; and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as 
many back as I could well stand under. 

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated 
with great pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the 
pleasantness of the situation ; the security from storms on 
that side ; the water and the wood ; and concluded that I 
had pitched upon a place to fix my abode in, which was by 
far the worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I began 
to consider of removing my habitation, and to look out for a 
place equally safe as where I was now situate ; if possible, 
in that pleasant fruitfid part of the island. 

This thought ran long in my head ; and I was exceeding 
fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of rthe place 
tempting me : but when I came to a nearer view of it, I 
considered that 1 was now by the seaside, where it was at 
least possible that something might happen to my advantage, 
and, by the same ill-fate that brought me hither, might 
bring some other unhappy wretches to the same place ; and 
though it was scarce probable that any such thing should 
ever happen, yet to enclose myself among the hills and 
woods in the centre of the island, was to anticipate luy 
bondage, and to render such an affair not only improbable, 
but impossible ; and that therefore I ought not "by any 
means to remove. However, I was so enamoied of this 
place, that I spent much of my time there for the whole 
remaining part of the month of July; and though, upos 
•eeond thoughts, I resolved, as above stated, not to remov^ 



tit ApVENTUaBS OF 

yet I built me a Ihdci kind of a bower, arid sunounded it al 
a distance with a Btirang fence, being a double hedge, ai 
high as I could teach, well staked, and filled between wifcb 
brushwood. Here I lay yery secure sottie.times two or three 
nights together: always going over it with a ladder, as before ; 
•o that I fancied now I had my country and my sea*coast 
houMe. This woi^ took me up till the beginning of August 

] had but newly fini^ed my fence, and began to eiyoy 
ny labor, when the rains came on, and made me stick close 
to my first habitation: for though I had made a test like 
the other, with a piece of sail, and spread it very weU, yet I 
had not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor 
a cave behind me to retreat into when the rains were extra 
ordinary. 

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished 
my bower, and began to eiyoy myself. The ^ of August^ 
I £>und the grapes I had hung up were perfectly dried, and 
indeed were excellent good raisins of the sim; so I began 
to take them down from the trees ; and it was very happy 
that I did so, as the rains which followed would have spoiled 
them, and I should have lost the best part of my winter 
food; for I had above two hundred large bunches of them. 
No sooner had I taken them all down, and carried most oi 
them home to my cave, but it began to rain: and from 
hence, which was the 14th of Aug^t, it rained, more or 
less, every day till the middle of October; and sometimeii 
so violently, that I could not stir out of my cave for several 
days. 

In this seasop, I was much surprised with the increase )l 
my femily. I had been concerned for the loss of one of my 
cats, who ran away from me, or, us I thought, had been 
dead ; and I heard no more of her, till, to my astonishment^ 
the came home with three kittens. This was the mora 
Strange to me, because, about the end of August, though J 
k$d killed a wild cat^ as I called it, with my gun, yet ] 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 12^ 

I ^ught it was quite a different kind from our £ux>peaa 
t^s: yet the young cats were the same kind of house-breed 
aft che old one ; and both of my cats being females, I thought 
it »«ry strange. But from these three, 1 afterwards came tc 
be 40 pestered with cats tnat I was forced to kill them likt 
verdiin, or wild beasts, and to drive them from my housd at 
muta as possible. 

t^xym the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain; $o 
that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to be 
much wet.^ In this confinement, I began to be straitened 
for food ; but venturing out twice, I one day killed a 
goat, and the last day, which was the 24th, found a very 
large tortoise, which was a treat to me. My food was 
now related thus ; I ate a bunch of raisins for my break- 
fast ; a piece of the goat's flesh, or of the turtle, broiled, foi 
my dinier (for, to my great misfortune, I had no vessel to 
boil or stew anything) ; and two or three of the turtle's eggs 
for my supper. 

During this confinement in my cover from the rain, I 
worked d«dly two or three hours at enlarging my cave ; and 
by degrees worked it on towards one side, till I came to the 
outside of the hill ; and made a door, or way out, which 
came beyond my fence or wall ; and so I came in and out 
this way. But I was not perfectly easy at lying so open 
for as I had managed myself before, I was in a perfect 
enclosure ; whereas now, I thought I lay exposed ; and yet 
I could not perceive that there was any living thing to fear, 
the biggest creature that I had as yet seen upon the island 
oeing a goat. 

September 30. I was now come to the unhappy anni- 
f crsary of my landing ; I cast up the notches on my post, 
and found I had been on shore three hundred and s^xty-five 
days. I kept this day as a solemn fast ! setting it apart fo7 
religious exercise, prostrating myself on the ground witi 
the most serious humiliation, confessing ivy sins t*> Ood 



tSS ADVENTURES OP 

•cknow] edging his righteous judgmentft upon me, and 
praying to him to have mercy on me through Jesus Chnst; 
and having not tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, 
even till the going down of the sun, I then ate a biscuit 
«nd a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the d&j 
MB I began it. I had all this time observed no sabbath-day ; 
for as at first I had no sense of religion upon my mind, 1 
had, after some time, omitted to distinguish the weeks, by 
making a longer notch than ordinary for the sabbath-day, 
and so did not really know what any of the days were i but 
now having cast \ip the days, as above, I found I had been 
there a year ; so I divided it into weeks, and set apart every 
seventh day for a sabbath ; though I found, at the end ol 
my account, I had lost a day or two in my reckoning. A 
littie after this, my ink beginning to fail me, I contented 
myself to use it more sparingly ; and to write down only 
the most remarkable events of my life, without continuing a 
daily memorandum of other things. 

The rainy season and the dry sf^ason began now to appear 
regpilar to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide 
for them accordingly ; but I bought all my experience before 
I had it ; and what I am going to relate, was one of the 
most discouraging experiments that I had made at all. 

I have mentioned that I had saved a few ears of barley, 
and rice, which I had so suprisingly foimd sprung up, as I 
thought, of themselves. I believe there were about thirty 
stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley; and now I 
thought it a proper time to sow it after the rains ; the son 
being in its southern position, going from me. Accordingly 
I dug a piece of ground, as well as I could, with my woodei 
spade ; and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain ; 
but as I was sowing, it casually occurred to my thoughti 
Jiat I would not sow it all at first, because I did not 
know whe i was the proper time for it ; bo I sowed aboul 
kwo-thxrdt of the seed, leaving about a handful of each , 



ROBINSON CRUSOR. I2f 

%iid it was a great comfort for me afterwards that 1 did su, 
for not one grain of what I sowed this time came to any- 
thing ; for the dry month following, and the earth having 
ihus had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no moisture 
tc assist its growth, and never came up at all till the wet 
«e&'9on had come again, and then it grew as if it had been 
but newly sown. Finding my first seed did not grow, which 
I easily imagined was from the drought, I sought for a moistei 
piece of ground to make another trial in ; and I dug up a 
piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed the refit oi 
my seed in February, a little before the vernal equinox. 
This having the rainy months of March and April to water 
it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop ; 
but having only part of the seed left, and not daring to sow 
all that I had, I got but a small quantity at last, my whole 
crop not amounting to above half a peck of each kind. 
But by this experiment I was made master of my business, 
and knew exactly when wa^ the proper time to sow ; and 
that I might expect two seed-times, and two harvests, every 
year. 

While this com was growing, I made a little discovery, 
which was of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains 
were over, and the weather began to settle, which was about 
the month of November, I made a visit up the country co 
my bower ; where, though I had not been for Aome months, 
yet I found all things just as I had left them. The circle or 
double hedge that I had made was not only firm and entire, 
but the stakes which I had cut out of some trees that grew 
thereabouts, were all shot out and grown with long branches, 
as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the first year after 
I Dpping its head ; but I could not tell what tree to call it 
that these stakes were cut &om. I was surprised, and yet 
very well pleased, to see the young trees grow; and I 
pruned them, and led them to grow as much alike as I could ; 
ind it it Rcaice credible how beautiful a figure they gre^

nto in tnree years ; so that, though tire hedge made a eirdi 
of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet he trees, foi 
•uch I might now call them, soon covered it, and it was a 
eomplete shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry season. 
This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make 
me a hedge like this, in a semicircle round my wall (I mean 
that of my first dwelling), which 1 did ; and placing the 
troes or stakes in a double row, at about eight yards 
listance firom my first fence, they grew presently ; and 
wete at first a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards 
4rved for a defence also ; as I shall observe in its order.

BA8K.BT-MAKINO. 

I FOUND now that the seasons of the year might generally 
be divided, not into summer and winter as in Europe, but 
into the rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were 
generally thus : From the middle of February to the middle 
of April, rainy ; the sun being then on or near the equinox. 
From the middle of April till the middle of August, dry ; 
the sun being then north of the Line. From the middle oJ 
August till the middle of October, rainy ; the sun being 
then come back to the Line. From the middle of Octobet 
to the middle of February, dry ; the sim being th^n to the 
south of the Line. 

The rainy seasons held sometimes longer and sometimes 
shorter, as the winds happened to blow ; but this was th« 
general observation I made. Aite.r I had found, by ex 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. l$l 

penen^e, the ill cousequencei of being abroad in lie raiii^ 
I took care to furnish myself with provisions be.brehand, 
that I might not be obliged to go out ; and I sat within 
doon as much as possible during the wet months. Thit 
tune I found much employment, and very suitable also to 
the time ; for I found great occasion for many things whid* 
I had no way to Aimish myself with but by hard labor and 
oonstant application ; particularly, I tried many ways to 
make myself a basket ; but all the twigs I could get for the 
pmpose proved so brittle that they would do nothing. Ii 
proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was 
a boy, I used to take great delight in standing at a basket 
maker's in the town where my father lived, to see them 
make their wicker-ware ; and being, as boys usually are, 
very officious to help, and a great observer of the manner . 
how they worked those things, and sometimes lending a 
hand, I had by these means full knowledge of the methods 
of it, so that I wanted nothing but the materials ; when it 
came into my mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence 
I cut my stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the 
sallows, willows, and osiers, in England ; and I resolved to 
try. Accordingly, the next day, I went to my country- 
house, as I called it ; and cutting some of the smaller twigs, 
I found them to my purpose as much as I could desire; 
whereupon I came the next time prepared with a hatchet to 
cut down a quantity, which I soon found, for there was 
plenty of them. These I set up to dry within my circle or 
hedge ; and when they were fit for use, I carried them to 
my cave ; and here, during the next season, I employed 
myself in making, as well as I could, several baskets ; ooth 
to carry earth, or to carry or lay up anything as I had orca- 
lior for. Though I did not finish them very handsomely, 
yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose: 
and thus, afterwards I took care never to be without them ;

iirong deep baaAets, to place my com in, instejui of aackii 
when I should come to have any quantity of it. 

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a worli >f 
time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to 
supply two other wants. I had no vessel to hold anything 
that was liqidd, except two runlets, which were almost fall 
of rum ; and some glass bottles, some of the common size, 
and others (which were case bottles) square, for the holding 
of waters, spirits, d^c. I had not so much as a pot to boil 
anything ; except a great kettle which I saved out of the 
ship, and which was too big for such use as I desired it, viz., 
to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The second 
thing I would fain have had, was a tobacco pipe ; but it was 
unpossible for me to make one ; however, I found a con- 
trivance for that too at last. I employed myself in planting 
my second row of stakes or piles, and also in this wicker- 
working all the summer or dry season ; when another busi- 
ness took me up more time than it could be imagined I 
could spare. 

I mentioned before that I 1^ a great mind to see tlie 
whole island ; and that I had travelled up the brook, and so 
on to where I had built my bower, and where I bad an 
opening quite to the dea, on the other side of the island. I 
now resolved to travel quite across to the seashore, on that 
side : so taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger 
quantity of powder and shot than usual ; with two biscuit- 
cakes, and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch, for my 
store; I began my journey. When I had passed the \ale 
where my bower stood, as above, I came within view of the 
lei, to the west; and it being a very clear day, I fairly 
dec lied lani, whether an island or .continent I could not 
teil ; Vu; it .ay very high, extending from W. to W.S.W. at 
% very great distance ; by my guess, it could not be less 
ttian fifteen or twenty leagues off.

otherwise than that I knew it must be part of Am^^rica ; and 
fts I concluded, by all my observations, must be near thf 
Spanish dominions ; and perhaps was all inhabited bj 
■ayages^ where, if I should have landed, I had been in a 
worse condition than I was now. I therefore acquiesced 
in the dispositions of Providence, which I began now to 
own and to believe ordered everything for the best ; 1 say, 
[ quieted my mind with this, and left off afflicting myseli 
with fruitless wishes of being there. Besides, after some 
pause upon thb affair, I considered that if this land was the 
Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or other, see 
some vessel pass or repass one way or other; but if not, 
then it was the savage coast between the Spanish country 
and the Brazils, whose inhabitants are indeed the wor^t of 
savages ; for they are cannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not 
to murder and devour all human beings that fall into their 
Hands. 

With these considerations, walking very leisurely forward, 
I found this side of the island, where I now was, much 
pleasanter than mine ; the open or savannah fields sweetly 
adorned with flowers and grass, and full of .very fine woods. 
I saw abundance of parrots ; and fain would have caught 
one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to 
speak to me. I did, after taking some pains, catch a young 
parrot; for I knocked it down with a stick, and, having 
recovered it, I brought it home ; but it was some years 
before I could make him speak ; however, at last I taught 
him to call me by my name very familiarly. But the acci- 
dent that followed, though it be a trifle, will be very divert- 
ing in its place. 

I was exceedingly amused with this journey. I found in 
the low grounds hares^ as I thought them to be, and foxes: 
but they differed greatly from all the other kinds I had met 
with ; nor could I satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed 
seTeial. But I had no need to be veriurous ; for I had no 
12

want of food, and oi that which waavcry good too; otpe- 
eially theite three sorts, viz^., goate, pigeons, and turtle, oi 
t3rtoise. With these, added to my grapes, Leadenhall- 
aiarket could not have furnished a table better than I, in 
proportion to the company ; and though my case was 
de]dorable enough, yet I had great cause for thankfulness ; 
as I was not driyen to any extremities for food, but had 
lather plenty, even to dainties. 

I never travelled on this journey above two miles outright 
in a day, or thereabout; but I took so many turns and 
fetcms to see what discoveries I could make, that I came 
weary enough to the place where I resolved to sit down 
for the night; and then I either reposed myself in a tree, 
or surrounded myself with a row of stakes, set upright in 
the ground, either from one tree to another, or so as no 
wild creature eould come at me without waking me. 

As soon as I came to the seashore, I was surprised to 
see that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the 
island ; for here indeed the shore was covered with in- 
numerable turtles ; whereas, on the other side, I had found 
but three in a^year and a half. Here was also an infinite 
number of '3wls of many kinds; some of which I had 
seen, and some of which I had not seen before, and many 
of them very good meat ; but such as I knew not the 
names of, except those called penguins. 

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very 
sparing of my powder and shot; and therefore had mcie 
mind to kill a she-goat, if I could, which I could bettei 
feed on. But, though there were many goats here, more 
than on my side of the island, yet it was with much 
more difficulty that I could come near them; the country 
being flat and even, and they saw me much sooner than 
when I was upon a hill. 

I confess this side of the country was much pleasantei 
4\ac mine ; yet I had not the least inclination to remove: 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ]S9 

hr as I was fixed in my habitation, it became naiiral to 
me, and I seemed all the while I was hete to be as it 
were upon a journey, and from home. However, I 
travelled along the seashore towards the east, 1 suppose 
about twelve miles ; and then setting up a great pole upc^i 
the shore for a mark, I concluded I would go home again ; 
and that the next journey I took should be on the othei 
side of the island, east from my dwelling, and so round tiU 
I came to my post again : of which in its place. 

I took another way to come back than that I went, 
thinking I could easily keep so much of the island in my 
view, that I could not miss my first dwelling by viewing 
the country : but I found myself mistaken ; for being come 
about two or three miles, I found myself descended into a 
very large valley, but so surrounded with hills, and those 
hills covered with wood, that I could not see which was my 
way by any direction but that of the sun, nor even then, 
unless I knew very well the position of the sun at that time 
of the day. And it happened to my farther misfortune, that 
the weather proved hazy for three or four days while I was 
in this valley ; and not being able to see the sun, I wandered 
about very uncomfortable, and at last was obliged to find 
out the seaside, look for my post, and come back the same 
way I went ; and then bv easy journeys I turned homeward.

two yean past. Before, as I walked about, either on mj 
hunting, or for viewing^ the country, the anguish of my soul 
at my condition would break out upon me on a sudden, 
and my very heart would die within me, to think of the 
woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in ; and how I wai 
a prisoner, locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the 
ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without redemption. 
[n the midst of the greatest composures of my mind, this 
would break out upon me like a storm, and make me wring 
my hands snd weep like a child : sometimes it would take 
me in the middle of my work, and I would immediately sit 
down and sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour oi 
two together : this was still worse to pie ; but if I could 
burst into tears, or give vent to my feelings by words, it 
would go off; and my grief being exhausted would abate. 

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts ; I 
daily read the word of God, and applied all the comforts oi 
it to my present state. One morning, being very sad, I 
* opened the Bible upon these words, *'I will never leave 
thee, nor forsake thee : " immediately it occurred that these 
words were to me ; why else should they be directed in 
such a manner, just at the moment when I was mourning 
over my condition, as one forsaken of God and man ? Well 
then, said iV if God does not forsake me, of what ill con- 
sequence can it be, or what matters it, though the world 
should forsake me ; seeing on the other hand, if I had all 
the world, and should lose the favor and blessing of God, 
there would be no comparison in the loss ? 

From this moment I began to conclude in my mind that 
It was possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken, 
solitary condition, than it was probable I should ever have 
been in any other particular state of the world ; and with 
this thought I was going to give thanks to God for bringing 
me to this place. I know not what it was, but something 
shook ed my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak thi 



ROBINSON CRUSOiS l^ 

»<> ds. Plow canst thou be such a hypocrite, said I, tTea 
audibly, to pretend to be thankful foi a condition, which, 
however thou mayest endeavor to be ccmtented with, thou 
wouldest ratler pray heartily to be delivered from? Heie I 
stopped ; but though I could not say I th inked God foi 
being here,, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God foi opening 
my eyes, by whatever afflicting providences, to see the formei 
condition of my life, and to mourn for my wickedness, and 
repent. I never opened the Bible, or shut it, but my very 
soul within me blessed God for directing my friend in Eng- 
land, without any order of mine, to pack it up among my 
goods ; and for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the 
wreck of the ship. 

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third 
year ; and though I have not given the reader the trouble of 
so particular an account of my works this year as the firsl^ 
yet in general it may be observed, that I was very seldom 
idle; but having regularly divided my time, according to 
the several daily employments that were before me ; such as, 
first, My duty to God, and the reading the Scriptures, which 
I constantly set apart some time for, thrice every day : 
secondly. Going abroad with my gun for food, which gen* 
erally took me up three hours every morning, when it did 
not rain : thirdly, Ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking 
what I had killed or catched for my supply ; these took up 
great part of the day ; also it is to be considered, that in 
the 'middle of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, the 
violence of the heat was too great to stir out ; so that about 
l^ur hours in the evening was all the time I could be sup- 
posed to work in; with this exception, that sometimes 1 
changed my hours of hunting and working, and went to 
work in the morning, and abroad with my gun in the after 
noon. 

To thiff short time allowed for labor, I desire nay b« 
idiled the exceeding laboriousness of my woik ; the man) 



140 ADVENTURES OF 

kouTB whi^h, for want of tools, want of help, and Htnt > 
•kill, everything I did took up out of my time : for example, 
I waa full two and forty days making me a board for a long 
•kelf^ which I wanted in my cave ; whereas, two sawyers, 
with their tools and a saw-pit, would have cut six of them 
out of the same tree in half a day. 

My case was this ; it was a large tree that was to be cut 
down, because my board was to be a broad one. This tree 
I was three days cutting down, and two more in cutting ofl 
the boughs, and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. 
With inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both the 
sides of it into chips, till it was light enough to move ; then 
I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a 
board, from end to end ; then turning that side downward, 
eut the other side, till I brought the plank to be about three 
inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one may judge 
the labor of my hands in such a piece of work ; but labor 
and patience carried me through that, and many other 
things ; I only observe this in particular, to show the reason 
why so much of my time went away with so little work, 
viz., that what might be a little to be done with help and 
tools, was a vas^ labor, and required a prodigious time to 
do alone, and by handy Notwithstanding this, with patience 
and labor I went through many things ; and, indeed, every- 
thing that my circumstances made necessary for me to do 
B8 will appear by what follows. 

I was now in the months of November and Decembei 
expecting my crop of barely and rice. The ground I haU 
manured or dug up for them was not great; for, as I 
observed, my seed of each was not above the quantity of 
half a peck, having lost one whole crop by sowing in tho 
dry season : but now my crop promised very well ; when, 
on a sudden, I found I was in danger of losing it alP again 
by enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce possible to 
Keep from it ; as, first, the goats, and wild creatures vhich ] 



ROBINSON GRUSOB. |4i 

called bares, who, tasting the sweetness of the Hade, la) 
in it night and day, as soon as it came up, and ate it so 
difse, that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk. 

I saw no remedy for thb, but by making an enclosura 
about it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal oi 
toil ; and the more, because it required speed. However, as 
my arable land was but small, suited to my crop, I got it 
tolerably well fenced in about three weeks' time ; and shoot- 
ing some of the creatures in the daytime, I set my dog to 
guard it in the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate, 
where he would stand and bark all night long ; so in a 
little time the enemies forsook tne place, and the com grew 
very strong and well, artd began to ripen apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my com was 
m the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now, 
when it was in the ear ; for going along by the place to 
see how it throve, I saw my little crop surrounded with fowls, 
I know not of how many sorts, who stood, as it were, 
watching till I should be gone. I immecliately let fly 
among them (for I always had my gun with me) ; I had 
no sooner shot, but there rose up a little cloud of fowls, 
which I had not seen at all, from among the com itself. 

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days 
they would devour all my hopes ; that I should be starved, 
and never be able to raise a crop at all ; and what to do 1 
could not tell : however, I resolved not to lose my com, il 
possible, though I should watch it night and day. In the 
flrst place, I went among it, to see what damage was already 
done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of it; but 
that as it was yet too green for them, the loss was not so 
great, but that the remainder was likely to be a good crop, 
if it could be saved. 

I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away, 1 
eould easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about 
ID'S, as i^ they only waited till T was gone away; and ths 



143 AOTSNTURBS OP 

ereEt proved it to be so ; for as I iwalked off, as if gone, 1 
was no sooner oat of their sight, than they dropjied down, 
one by one, into the com again. I was so provoked,^ that I 
could not have patience to stay till more came on, knowing 
tnat c^ery grain they ate now was, as it might be said, a 
peck loaf to me in the consequence; so coming up to the 
Lodge, I fired again, and killed three of them. This wi^ 
what I wished for ; so I took them up, and served them as 
we serve notorious thieves in England, viz., hanged them in 
chains, for terror to others. It is impossible to imagine that 
this should have such an effect as it had ; for the fowls not 
nnly never came to the com, but, in short, they forsook all 
that part of the island, and I could never see a bird near the 
place as long as my scarecrows hung there. This I was 
very glad of, you may be sure ; and about the latter end of 
December, which was our second harvest of the year, I 
reaped my com. 

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down : 
and all I could do was to make one as well as I could, out 
>f one of the broad-swords, or cutlasses, which I saved 
among the arms out of the ship. However, as my first crop 
f as but small, I had no great difficulty to cut it down : in 
short, I reaped it my way, for I cut nothing off but the ears, 
and carried it away in a great basket which I had made, and 
so rubbed, it out with my hands ; and at the end of all my 
harvesting, I found that out of my half peck of seed I had 
near two bushels of r.ce, and above two bushels and a half 
of barley; thai is to say, by my guess, for I had no 
neasure. 

However, this was great encouragement to me; and I 
hreasLW that, in time, it would please Gk>d to supply me 
with bread; and yet here I was perplexed again; for I 
neitlier knew how to grind, or make meal of my ccm« oc 
indeed how to clean it and part it ; nor if made into meal, 
tiLw to make breid of it; and if how to make it, yet ] 



ROBINSON CKCJSOB. HJ 

knew not how to bake it : these things being added to my 
desire of having a good quantity for store, and to secuio a 
constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of this crop, but 
to preserve it for seed against the next season ; and, in the 
aiean time, to employ all my study and hours of working to 
accomplish this great work of providing myself with corn 
and bread. 

It nught be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. 
It is a little wonderful, and what I believe few people have 
thought much upon, viz., the strange multitude of little 
things necessary in the providing, producing, curing, dres- 
sing, making, and finishing this one Article of bread. I, 
that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to my 
daily discouragement, and was made more sensible of it 
every hour, even after I had got the first handful of seed- 
corn, which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and 
indeed to a surprise. 

First, I had no plough to turn up the earth ; no spade ox 
shovel to dig it : well, this I conquered, by making a wooden 
spade, as I observed before ; but this did my work in but a 
wooden manner ; and though it cost me a great many days 
to make it, yet, for want of iron, it not only wore out the 
sooner, but made my work the harder, and performed it 
much worse. However, this I bore with, and was content 
to work it out with patience, and bear with the badness of 
ihe performance. When the com was sown, I had no har- 
row, but was forced to go over it myself, apd drag a great 
.K^avy bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be 
:alled, rather than rake or harrow it. When it was growing 
4nd grown, I have observed already how -many things 1 
wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or reap it, cure and carry 
it home, ^hresh, part it from the chaff, and save it ; then 1 
v^anted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it : yeast and salt 
i*j make it into bread, and an oven to bake it ; and yet al« 
luese things I did without, as shall be ol«erved ; and tb«

iOTP was an inestimable comfort and advantage to me : ab 
this as I said, made everything laborious and tedious to me, 
hut thbt there was no help for ; neither was my time so 
much loss to me, because, as I had divided it, a certain part 
of it was every day appointed to these works ; and as I 
refcolved to use none of the corn for bread till I hud a greater 
quintity by me, I had the next six months to apply my sell 
wholly, by labor and invention, to furnish myself w?th 
utf Qsils proper for the performing all the operations neces- 
iATy for making com fit for my use.

But now I was to prepare more land; for I had seed 
enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, 
I had a week*s work at least to make me a spade ; which, 
when it was done, was but a sorry one indeed, and ver^ 
heavy, and required double labor to work with it : however, 
I went through that, and sowed my seed in two large flat 
pieces of ground, as near my house as I could find them to 
Tiy mind, and fenced them in with a good hedge ; the stakes 
jf which were all cut ofi" that wood which I had set befo/e, 
and knew it would grow; so that, in one year's time, I 
knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that would 
ivant but little repair. This work took me up full three 
montlis ; because a great part of the time was in the wet 
leason, when I could not go abroad. Within dcoie, that is, 
when it rained, and I could not go out, I found employment 
»n tht» following occasions ; always observing, that while 1 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 145 

9tmB at work, I divirted myself with talking t^i m} parrot, 
tTid teaching him to speak ; and I quickly taught him to 
kaow his own name, and at last to speak it out pretty loud, 
Moll ; which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the 
sland by any mouth but my own. This, therefore, was not 
Tiy work, but an assistant to my work ; for now, as I said, 1 
bad a great employment upon my hands, as follows : I had 
lung studied, by some meahs or other, t^ make myself some 
*?artben vessels, A^hich indeed I wanted much, but knew not 
where to come at them : however, considering the heat of 
the climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any 
clay, I might botch up some such pot as might, being dried 
in the sun, be hard and strong enough to bear handling, 
and to hold anything that was dry, and required to be kept 
80 ; and as this was necessary in the preparing com, meal, 
&c., which was the thing I was upon, I resolved to make 
some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like jars^ 
*^o hold what should be put into them. 

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, 
to tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this pastil ; 
what odd, misshapen, ugly things I made ; how many of 
diem fell in, and how many fell out, the clay not being lliff 
enough to bear its own weight ; how many cracked by the 
over violent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily ; and 
how many fell in pieces with only removing, as well before 
as after they were dried ; and, in a word, how, after having 
labored hard to find the clay, to dig it, to temper it, to 
bring it home, and work it, I could not make above two 
large earthen ugly things (I cannot call them jars) in about 
two months' labor. 

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, 
1 lifted them very gently up, and set them down again in 
two great wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose 
lor them, that they might not break ; and as between the 
pot and tb« basket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed 
13 



146 ADVENTURES OF 

it full of the rice and barley straw ; and these two pdts 
being to stand always dry, I thought would hold my drt 
rom, and perhaps the meal, when the com was bruised. 

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pxite, 
yet I made several smaller things with better success ; such 
as little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and 
anything my hand turned to ; and the heat of the sun baked 
them very hard. % 

But all this would not answer my end, which was to get 
an earthen pot to hold liquids, and bear the fire, which none 
of these could do. It happened some time after, making a 
pretty lar^e fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put it 
out after I had done with it, I found a broken piece of one 
of my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a 
stone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see 
it ; and said to myself, that certainly they might be made to 
bum whole, if they would bum broken. 

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make 
it bum some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the 
potters bum in, or of glazing them with lead, though I had 
some lead to do it with ; but I placed three large , pipkins 
aiA two or three pots in a pile, one upon another, and 
placed my fire-wood all round it, with a great heap ol 
embers under them. I plied the fire with fresh fuel round 
the outside, and upon the top, till I saw the pots in tlie 
inside red-hot quite through, and observed that they did not 
Clack at all : when I saw them clear red, I let them stand in 
that heat about five or six hours, till I found one of them« 
though it did not crack, did melt or run ; for the sand which 
was mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the heat, 
and would have run into glass, if I had gone on; so I 
slacked my fire gradually, till the pots began to abate of tho 
red color ; and watching them all night, that I might not let 
the fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three very go^ 
t will not say handsome, pipkins, and two other earth^i 



ROBlNSO^ CRU80K. 147 

pots, as hard b imt as could be desired ; and one of tLev 
perfectly glazed with the running of the sand. 

After this experiment, 1 need not say that I wanted t.o 
•ort of earthenware for my use : but 1 must needs say, as to 
the shapes of them, they were very indifferent, as any onl 
may suppose, as I had no way of making them but as thfl 
children make dirt pies, or as a woman would make pies thai 
ficver learned to raise paste. No joy at a thing of so mean 
a natura was ever equal to mine, when I found I had made 
an sarthen pot that would bear the fire ; and I had hardly 
patience to stay till they were cold, before I set one on the 
fire again, with some wiiter in it, to boil me some meat, 
which it did admirably well ; and with a piece of a kid I 
made some very good broth ; though I wanted oatmeal, and 
several other ingredients requisite to make it so good as I 
would have had it been. 

My next concern was to get a stone mortar to stamp or 
beat some corn it ; for as to the mill, there was no thought 
of arriving to that perfection of art with one pair of hands. 
To supply this want I was at a great loss ; for, of all trades 
\n the world, I was as perfectly unqualified for a stonecutter 
as for any whatever ; neither had I any tools to go about it 
with. 1 spent many a day to find out a great stone big 
enough to cut hollow, and piake fit for a mortar ; , but could 
find none at all, except what was in the solid rock, and 
which 1 had no way^ to dig or cut out ; nor, indeed, were 
the rocks in the island of sufliicient hardness, as they were 
all of a sandy crumbling stone, which would neither bear 
the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the corn 
without filling it with sand ; so, after a great deal of time

labor, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in Brad, 
make their canoes. After this, I made a great heavy pestle, 
or beater, of the wood, called iron- wood : and this " pre- 
pared and laid by against I had my next crop of com, when 
I proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound, my com inta 
meal, to make my bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a sieve, or search, to dreal 
my meal, and to part it from the bran and the husk, without 
which I did not see it possible I could have any bread. 
This was a most difficult thing, even but to think on ; for I 
had nothing like the necessary thing to make it ; I mean 
fine thin canvass or stuff, to search the meal through. Here 
I was at a full stop for many months ; nor did I really know 
what to do : linen I had none left, but what was mere rags ; 
I had goats' hair, but neither knew how to weave it nor 
spin it ; and had I known how, here were no tools to work 
it with : all the remedy I found for this was, at last recol- 
lecting I had, among the seamen's clothes which were saved 
out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin, with 
some pieces of these I make three small sieves, proper 
enough for the work ; and thus I made shift for some years : 
how I did afterwards, I shall show in its place. . 

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and 
how I should make bread when I came to have corn : for, 
first, I had no yeast ; as to that part, there was no supply- 
ing the want, so I did not concern my^lf much about it ; 
but for an oven I was indeed puzzled. At length I found 
out an expedient for that also, which was this; I made 
some earthen vessels, very broad, but not deep, that is to 
say, about two feet diameter, and not above nine inchei 
deep: these I burned in the fire, as I had done the other, 
and laid them by ; and when I wanted to bake, I made a 
great lire upon my hearth, which I had paved with some 
•quaie tiles, of my own making and bu 'ning also ; but I 
fhiadd nit call them square. Wnen the firewood whi

Iramei into embers, or live coals, 1 drew thei i forward upon 
the hearth, so as to cover it all over, and there let them lie 
till the hearth was very hot ; then sweeping away all the 
embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves, and covering them 
with the earthen pjt, drew the embers all round the outside 
of the pot, to keep in and add to the heat ; and ^.hus, aa 
well as in the best oven in the jvorld, I baked my barley 
loaves, and became, in a little time, a good pastry-cock 
into the bargain; for I made myself several cakes and 
puddings of the rice ; but made no pies, as 1 had nothing to 
put into them except the flesh of fowls or goats. 

It need not be wondered at, if all these things took me 
up most part of the third year of my abode here ; for, it is 
to be observed, in the intervals of these things, I had my 
new harvest and husbandry to manage : I reaped my com 
in its season, and carried it home as well as I could, and 
l&id it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to 
rub it out ; for I had no floor to thresh it on, or instrument 
to thresh it with. 

And now, indeed, my stock of com increasing, I really 
wanted to build my barns bigger : I wanted a place to lay 
it up in ; for the increase of the com now yielded me so 
much, that I had of the barley about twenty bushels, and oi 
rice as much, or more, insomuch that now I resolved to begin 
to use it freely ; for my bread had been ignite gone a great 
while : I resolved also to see what quantity would be suf* 
ficient for me a' whole year, and to sow but once a year. 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley 
and rice were much more than I could consume in a year ; 
80 I resolved to sow just the same quantity every year thai 
1 sowed the last, in hopes that such a quantity wo ild fully 
provide me with bread, &c.

AxL the wliile these things were doing, you ma, be sure mj 
thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land which 1 
had seen from the other side of the island ; and I was not 
without some secret wishes that I was on shore there ; 
fancying, that seeing the main land, and an inhabited coun- 
try, I might find some way or other to convey myself farther, 
and perhaps at last find some means of escape. 

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of 
such a condition, and that I might fall into the hands oi 
savages, and perhaps such as I might have reason to think 
far worse than the lions and tigers of Africa ; that if 1 once 
came in their power, I shoidd run a hazard of more than a 
thousand to one of heing killed, and perhaps of heing eaten ; 
for I had heard that the people of the Carrihean coast were 
cannihals, or man-eaters ; and I knew, hy the latitude, that 
I could not be far off from that shore. Then supposing they 
were not cannibals, yet that they might kill me, as they had 
many Europeans who had fallen into their hands, even when 
they have been ten or twenty together ; much more 1, who 
was but one, and could make little or no defence ; all these 
things, I say, which I ought to have considered well of, and 
did cast up in my thoughts afterwards, took up none uf my 
apprehensions at first ; yet my head ran mightily upon the 
thought of getting over to the shore. 

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with 
die 9houlder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a 
thouBand miles on t\e coast of AMca : but this was in Taint 



ROBINSON ;RUS0K l&\ 

ihen I thought 1 would go ai.d look i.t our ship*8 Doat, 
which, as I have said, was blown up upon the shore a greaf 
way, in the storm, when we were first cast away. She laj 
nearly where she did at first, but not quite ; having turned, 
by the force of the waves and the winds, almost bottom 
Lpward, against a high ridge of beachy rough sand ; but no 
water about her, as before. If I had had hands to have 
refitt(.d her, and to have punched her into the water, the 
boat would have done very well, and I might have gom 
back into the Brazils with her easily enough ; but I mighi 
Lave foreseen that I could no more turn her and set lier 
apright upon her bottom, than I could remove the island : 
however, 1 went to the woods, and cut levers and rollers, 
and brought them to the boat, resolving to try what I could 
do ; suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn her down, 
and repair the damage she had received, she would be a very 
good boat, and I might venture to sea in her.^ 

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, 
and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it : at last, 
finding it impossible to heave her up with my little strength, 
I fell to digging away the sand, to undermine her, and so as 
to make her fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and 
guide her right in the fall. But when I had done this, I 
was unable to stir her up again, or to get under her, much 
less to move her forward towards the water ; so I was forced 
to give it over : and yet, though I gave over the hopes of 
the boat, my desire to venture over the main increased, 
rather than diminished, as the means for it seemed imp:isi • 
ble. 

At length, I began to think whether it was not possiblu 
to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives ol 
these climates make, even without tools, or, as 1 might say, 
without hands, of the trunk of a great tree. This I not only 
bought possible, but easy, and pleased myself extremely 
«rith the idea of making it, and with my having mucb more 



453 ADVENTURES OF 

eonyemencc for it than any of the Negroes or Indians ^ bat 
not at all considering the particular inconveniences which 1 
lay under more than the Indians did, viz., the want of handa 
to mave it into the water when it was made, a difficulty 
much harder for me to surmount than all the consequences ol 
want of tools could be to them : for what could it avail me, 
if, after I had chosen my tree, and with much trouble cut it 
down, and might be able with my tools to hew and dub the 
outside into the proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut the 
inside to make it hollow, so as to make a boat of it — if, 
after all this, I must leave it just where I found it, and was 
not able to launch it into the water ? 

One would imagine, if I had had the least reflection upon 
my mind of my circumstances while I was making this boat, 
I should have immediately thought how I was to get it into 
the sea : but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage in 
it, that I never once considered how I should get it ofil 
the land ; and it was really, in its own nature, more easy 
for me to guide it over forty-five miles of sea, than the 
forty-five fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in 
the water. 

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool 
that ever man did, who had any of his senses awa&e. ]^ 
pleased myself with the design, without determi?iing 
whether I was able to undertake it ; not but that the 
difficulty of launching my boat came often into my head ; 
but 1 put a stop to my own inquiries into it, by this 
foolish answer : Let us first make it ; I warrant I will 
find some way or other to get it along when it is done. 

This was a most preposterous method; but the eagei- 
Q IBS of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went. I felled 
a cedar tree, and I question much whether Solomon 
ever had such a one for the building of the Temple al 
Jerusalem ; it was five feet ten inches diameter at the 
')wer part next the stump, and four feet eleven inchei 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 158 

iiamctei at the end of twenty two feet, where it Ic^dCneir 
and then parted into branches. It was not without infi« 
nite labor that I felled this tree ; 1 was twenty day4 
hacking and hewing at the bottom, and fourteen more 
getting the branchc^s and limbs, and the vast spreading head 
of it, cut off : after this, it cost me a month to shape it and 
dub it to a proportion, and to something like the bottom of 
a boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost 
me near three months more to clear the inside, and work i( 
out so as to make an exact boat of it : this I did, indeed, 
without fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint of 
aard labor, till I had brought it to be a very handsome peri- 
agua, and big enough to have carried six-and-twenty men, 
and consequently big enough to have carried me and all my 
cargo. 

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely 
delighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than 
ever I saw a canoe or a periagua tha^was made of one tree, 
in my life. Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may be 
sure ; and there remained nothing but to get it into the 
water ; which, had I accomplished, I make no question but I 
should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely 
to be performed, that ever was undertakeji. 

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me ; 
though they cost me inexpressible labor too. It lay about 
one hundred yards from the water, and not more ; but the 
first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards the cre«k. 
Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to dig 
into the surface of the earth and so make a declivity ; this I 
began, and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains ; (but who 
grudge pains that have their deliverance in view ?) when this 
was worked through, and this difficulty managed, it was sriF 
much the same, for I could no more stir the canoe than . 
tould the other boat. Then I measured the distance ol 
ground, and resolved ti cut a dock, or canal, to brinfi; thf 



154 ADVENTURES Of 

vrater up to the canoe, seeing I could not bring he jaim 
down to the water. Well, I began this work ; ai il when ] 
began to enter upon it, and calculate how deep it was to be 
dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be thrown out, I found 
by the number of hands I had, having none but my cwn, 
that it must have been ten or twelve years before I could 
have gone through with it ; for the shore lay so high, that 
at the upper end it must have been at least twenty feet deep ; 
this attempt, though with great reluctancy, I was at length 
obliged to give over also. 

This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, 
the folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, an 
before we judge rightly of our own strength to go througl 
with it. 

In the middle of this work, I finished my fourth year ia 
this place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, 
and with as much comfort as before ; for, by a constant 
study and serious app^cation to the word of God, and by the 
assistance of his grace, I gained a different knowledge from 
what I had before ; I entertained different notions of things ; 
I looked upon the world as a thing remote, which I had 
nothing to do with, no expectation from, and, indeed, no 
desires about ; in a word, I had nothing to do with it, nor 
was ever likely to have ; I thought it looked, as we may 
perhaps look upon it hereafter, viz., as a place I had lived 
in, but was come out of it ; and well might I say, as Fathe 
Abraham to Dives, *' Between me and thee is a great guk 
fixed." 

In the first place, I was here removed from aJ the wicked- 
ncsa of the world ; I had neither the lust of the flesh, the 
lust of the eye, not the pride of life. I had nothing to 
lovet, for I Lad all that I was now capable of enjoying; I 
was lord of the whole manor ; or, if I pleased, I might cal] 
myself king or emperor over the whole country whidi I bad 
possession of there were no rivals ; I had ao competitor

•o I let as li*^tle grow as 1 thought enough for my occasion 
I had tortoise or turtle enough, but now and then one wai 
as much as I could put to any use ; I had timber enough to 
have built a fleet of ships ; and I had grapes enough to have 
made wine, or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that • 
fleet when it had been built. 

But all I could make use of was all that was valuable : 1 
Lad enough to eat and supply my wants, and what was the 
rest to me ? If I killed more flesh than I could eat, the dog 
must eat it, or vermin ; if 1 sowed more corn than I could 
eat, it must be spoiled ; the trees that I cut down were lying 
u) rot on the ground ; I could make no use of them than for 
fuel, and that I had no other occasion for but to dress my 
food. 

In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to 
me, upon just reflection, that all the good things of this 
world are of no farther good to us than for our use ; and 
that whatever we may heap up to give others, we enjoy oiJy 
as much as we can use, and no more. The most covetous 
griping miser in the world would have been cured of the 
vice of covetousness, if he had been in my case ; for I pos- 
sessed infinitely more than I knew what to do with. 1 had 
no room for desire, except it was for things which 1 had 
not, and they were comparatively but trifles, though indeed 
of great use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of 
money, as well gold as silver, about thirty-six pounds ster- 
ling. Alas ! there the nasty, sorry, useless stufi* lay : I h^id 
no manner of business for it : and I often thought within 
myself, that 1 would have given a har dful of it for a gross 
tf tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind my com ; nay, 
I w ould have given it all for sixpenny worth of tuiiJp and 
carrot saed from England, or for a handful of peas and 
beaAs. an4 a pottle of ink. As it was, I had not tbt lea^t

luiyantage by it, or benefit n-om it ; but there it lay in » 
drawer, and grew mouldy wi:h the damp of the cave in tho 
wet seasons ; and if I had had the drawer full of diamonds, 
it had been the same case, — they would have been of no 
ID inner of value to me because of no use. 

I had now brought my state of life to be much moie 
;( mfortable in itself than it was at £rst, and much easier to 
my mind, as well as to my body. I frequently sat down to 
meat with thankfulness, and admired the hand of Ood'a 
providence, which had thus spread my table in the wilder- 
ness : I learned to look more upon the bright side of my 
condition, and less upon the dark side, and to consider what 
I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted : and this gave me 
sometimes such secret comforts, that I cannot express them ; 
and which I take notice of here, to put those discontented 
people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what 
Qod has given them, because they see and covet something 
that he has not given them. All our discontents about what 
we want appeared to me to spring from the want of thank- 
fulness for what we have. 

Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless 
would be so to any one that should fall into such distress ai 
mine was ; and this was, to compare my present condition 
with what I at first expected it would be : nay, with what it 
would certainly have been, if the good providence of God^ 
hac not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up near to 
the shore, where I not only could com* at her, but could 
biing what I got out of her to the shore, for my reb'ef and 
comfort; \nthout which, I had wanted for tools to work, 
weapons for defence, and gunpowder and shot for getting 
my food. 

1 spent whole hours, 1 may say whole days, in represent^ 
ing to myself, in the most lively colors, how I must ha/e 
ftcted if I had got nothing out of the ship. I could not 
litv« BO much as got any food, except fish and turtles ; aiMl 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 15) 

diat, &8 it w(*6 long before I found any of them, 1 must have 
perished ; that I should have lived, if I had not perished^ 
like a meie savage ; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by 
any contrivance, I had no way to flay or open it, or part the 
flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up, but must 
^aw it with my teeth, and pull it with my claws. like a 
beast. 

These reflections made me very sensible of the goo Iness 
of Providence to me, and very thankful for my present con- 
dition, with all its hardships and misfortunes; and this part 
also I cannot but recommend to the reflection of those who 
are apt, in their misery, to say, Is any affliction like mine ? 
Let them consid3r how much worse the cases of some people 
are, and their case might have been, if Providence had 
thought flt. 

I had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort 
my mind with hopes ; and this was, comparing my present 
condition with what I had deserved, and had therefore 
reason to expect from the hand of Providence. I had lived 
a dreadful life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear 
of GK)d. I had been well instructed by my father and 
mother ; neither had they been wanting to me, in their 
endeavors to infuse an early religious awe of Giod into my 
mind, a sense of my duty, and what the nature and end ol 
my being required of me. But, alas ! falling early into the 
seafaring life, which, of all lives, is the most destitute of the 
fear of God, though his terrors are always before them ; I 
4ay, falling curly into the seafaring life, and into seafaring 
company, all that little sense of religion which I had enter- 
tained was laughed out of me by my messmates; by a 
iiardened despising of dangers, and the views of death, 
which grew habitual to me ; by my long absence from all 
manner of opportunities to converse with anything but what 
Whs like myself, or to hear anything that was good« or tend 
Jig UvB^ ^u 



158 ADVENTURES OF 

So void was I of everything that was good, or of the least 
*ense of what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest 
deliverances I enjoyed (such as my escape from Sallee, my 
being taken up by the Portugese master of a ship, my being 
planted so well in the Brazils, my receiving the cargo from 
Engl md, and the like) I never had once the words, lliank 
God, so much as on my mind, or in my mouth ; nor in the 
greatest distress had I so much as a thought to pray to L.ni, 
or so much as to say. Lord, have mercy upon me ! no, nor 
to mention the name of God, unless it was to swear by, and 
blaspheme it. 

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, 
as I have already observed, on account of my wicked and 
hardened life past ; and when I looked about me, and con- 
«dered what particular providences had attended me since 
my coming into this place, and how God had dealt bountifully 
with me, — had not only punished me less than my iniquity 
had deserved, but had so plentifully provided for me, — this 
gave me great hopes that my repentance was accepted, and 
that God had yet mercies in store for me. 

With these reflections I worked my mind* up, not oniy to 
a resignation to the will of God in the present disposition of 
•ny circumstances, but even to a sincere thankfidness for my 
cc*ndition ; and that I, who was yet a living man, ought not 
to complain, seeing 1 had not the due punishment of my 
§in« ; that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no reason 
to have expected in that place, that I ought never more to 
repine at my condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily 
thanks for that daily bread, which nothing but a crowl of 
wonders cc^ild have brought ; that I ought to consider I had 
bien fed by a miracle, even as great as that of feeding; Elijah 
by ravens ; nay, by a long series of miracles ; and that 1 
toyiid hardly have named a place in the uninhabitable par* 
of the world where I could have been cast mor<5 to my 
mI vantage; a place where, as I had no society, which wsut 



ROBINSON CRUSUis 159 

my afHiction on one hand, so I fdund no ravenous beasts, nc 
furious wolves or tigers, to threaten my life ; no venomous 
or poisonous creatures, which I might feed on to my hurt , 
no savages, to murder and devour me. In a word, &9 my 
life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was a life of mercj 
another ; and I wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort, 
but to make myself sensible of Qod's goodness to me, and 
care over me in this condition ; and after I did make a jus* 
improvement of these things, I went away, and was no more 
sad. 

I had now been here so long, that many things which I 
brought on shore for my help were either quite gone, or very 
much wasted, and near spent. 

My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time, all 
but a very little, which I eked out with water, a little and a 
little, till it was so pale, it scarce . left any appearance of 
black upon the paper. As long as it lasted, I made use of 
it to minute down the days of the the month on which any 
remarkable thing happened to me : and, first, by casting up 
times past, I remember that there was a strange concurrence 
of days in the various providences which befell me, and 
wrhich, if I had been superstitiously inclined to observe daye 
as fatal or fortunate, I might have had reason to have looked 
upon with a great deal of curiosity. 

First, I had observed, that the same day that I broke away 
from my father and my friends, and ran away to Hull, in 
order to go to sea, the same day afterwards I was taken by 
the Sallee man-of-war, and made a slave ; the same day ol 
the year that I escaped out of the wreck of the ship in Yar- 
mouth Roads, that same day, years afterwards, I made my 
escape from Sallee in the boat : and the same day of the 
year I was bom on, viz., the 30th of September, that same 
day I had my life so miraculously saved twenty-six yean 
tfter, when I was cast on shore' in this island : so that mv 
cricked life and my solitary life began both on one da>. 



leO ADVENTURES OF 

The next thing tc my ink being wasted, was that of mj 
bread, I mean the bi&cuit which I brought out of the ship : 
this I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself but 
one cake of bread a day for above a year ; and yet I was 
quite without bread for near a year before I got any corn oi 
my own ; and great reason I had to be thankful that I had 
any at all, the getting it being, as has been already observf^d, 
noxt to miraculous. 

My clothes, too, began to decay mightily : as to linen, 1 
had none for a great while, except some checkered shirts 
which I found in the chests of the other seamen, and which 
I carefully preserved, because many times I could bear no 
clothes on \t\xt a shirt ; and it was a very great help to me 
that I had, <.mong all the men*s clothes of the ship, almost 
three dozen of shirts. There were also, indeed, several thick 
watchcoats of the seamen's which were left, but they were 
too hot to wear : and though it is true that the weather was 
I J violently hot that there was no need of clothes, yet I 
could not go quite naked, no, though I had been inclined to 
it, which I was not, nor could I abide the thought of it, 
though I was all alone. The reason why 1 coiJd not go 
juite naked was, I could not bear the heat of the sun so 
well when quite naked as with some clothes on ; nay, the 
very heat frequently blistered my skin : whereas, with a 
shirt on, ihe air itself made uome motion, and whistling 
under the shirt, was two-fold cooler than without it. No 
more could I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of fiio 
sun without a cap or hat ; the heat of the sun beating with 
such violence as it does in that place, would give me the 
headache pc^jently, by darting so directly upon my he&d, 
fiithout a cup or hat on, so that I could not bear it; whereat, 
if I put on my hat, it would presently go away. 

Upon these views, I began to consider about putting the 
few rags I had, which I called clothes, into sonre order. I 
biul worr ^\x^ all the waistcoats I had anH my -^usiness waa 



ROBINSON CRUSOE ; gj 

%ow to try if I could not make jackets out of ttie greaf 
watcbcoats that I had by me, and with such other materiali 
as I had ; so I sfet tc work a tailoring, or rather, indeed, a 
botching, for I made most piteous work of it. P owever, 1 
made shift to make two or three new waistcoat which 1 
hoped would serve me a great while : as for breeches, ot 
drawers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed, till after- 
wards. 

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the crea- 
tu*res that I killed, I mean four-footed ones ; and I had hung 
them up, stretched out with sticks, in the sun, by which 
means some of them- were so dry and hard that they were 
fit for little, but others I found very useful. The first thing 
I made of these was a great cap for my head, with the hair 
on the outside, to shoot off the rain ; and this I performed 
so well, that after this I made me a suit of clothes wholly o^ 
the skins, that is to say, a waistcoat, and breeches, open at 
the knees, and both loose ; for they were rather wanting to 
keep me cool than warm. I must not omit to acknowledge 
that they were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad car- 
penter, I was a worse tailor. However, they were such as 1 
made very good shift with ; and when I was abroad, if it 
happened to rain, the hair of my waistcoat and cap being 
uppermost, I was kept very dry. 

After this, I 'spent a great deal of time and pains to make 
me an umbrella : I was indeed in great want of one, an i 
had a great mind to make one : I had seen them made in 
the Brazils, where they were very useful in the great heati 
which are there ; and I felt the heat every jot as great here, 
and greater too, being nearer the equinox : besides, as I was 
obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, 
^8 well for the rains as the heats. I took a world of pains 
at it, and was a great while before I could make anything 
likely :o hold ; nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I 
tpdied two or three before I made one to my mind; but al

was not better than the utmost enjoynunt of human society

I CANNOT say that after this, for five years, any extraordi-

»f orio yeai's provision beforehand : I say, besmea this yeiiij 
labor, and my daily pursuit of going out with ray gun, I bad 
one labor, to make me a canoe, which at last 1 finished ; lo 
that by digging a canal to it of six feet wide, and four fiee 
deep, 1 brought it into the week, almost half a mile. Ai 
for the first, which was so vastly big, as I made it witlicul 
considering beforehand, as 1 ought to do, how I should be 
able to launch it, so, never being able to bring it into the 
water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lit 
where it was, as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser the 
next time : indeed, the next time, though I could not get a 
tree proper for it, and was in a place where I could not get 
the water to it at any less distance than, as I have said, near 
half a nule, yet as I saw it was practicable at last, I never 
gave it over ; and though 1 was near two years about it, yet 
I never grudged my labor, in hopes of having a boat to go 
off to sea at last. 

However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the 
size of it was not at all answerable to tie design which I 
had in view when I made the first ; I mean, of venturing 
over to the terra Jirma, where it was above forty miles 
broad ; accordingly, the smallness of my boat assisted to put 
an end to that design, and now I thought no more of it. 
As I had a boat, my next design was to make a cruise round 
the bland ; for as I had been on the other side in one place, 
crossing, as I have already described it, over the land, so the 
discoveries I made in that little journey made me very eagei 
to see othei parts of the coast ; and now I had a boat, I 
thought jf nothing but sailing round the island. 

For this purpose, that I might do everything with dis- 
eretion ajid consideration, I fitted up a little mast in mj 
boat, and made a sail to it out of some of the pieces of the 
ship's sails which lay in store, and of which I had a great 
stock by me. Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the 
boHt| I fuund she w; dd sail very well : then I made littla 



164 ADVENTURES OF 

lockets, or boxes, at each end of my boat, to put provision ^ 
necessaries, ammunition, &c., into, to be kept dry, eithei 
from rain or the spray of the sea ; and a little long holloiw 
place I cut in the inside of the boat, where I could lay m5 
gun, making a flap to hang down over it, to keep it dry. 

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stem, like a 
mast, to stand over my head, and keep the heat of the son 
off me, like an awning ; and thus every now and then took 
a little voyage upon the sea, but never went far out, nor far 
from the little creek. At last, being eager to view the cir- 
cumference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my cruise ; 
and accordingly, I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting 
in two dozen of loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of 
barley bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice (a food I 
ate a great deal of), a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and 
powder and shot for killing more, and two large watchcoats, 
of those which, as I mentioned before, I had saved out of 
the seamen's chests ; these I took, one to lie upon, and the 
other to cover me in the night. 

It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my 
reign, or my captivity, which you please, that I set out on 
this voyage, and I found it much longer than I expected ; 
for though the island itself was not very large, yet when I 
came to the east side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie 
about two leagues into the sea, some above water, some 
under it ; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a 
league more, so that I was obliged to go a great way out to 
•ea to double the point. 

When first I discovered them, I was going to give ovei 
my enterprise, and come back again, not knowing how far it 
might oblige me to go out to sea, and above all, doubting 
now I should get back again ; so I came to an anchor ; for I 
bad made me a kind of anchor with a pi^e of a broken 
l^rappling which I got out of the ship. 

Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went oa 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 16J 

ihure, climbing up on a hill, which seemed to overlook tba 
pom^ where I saw the full extent of it, and resohed t« 
venture. 

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I 
perceived a strong, and indeed a most furious current, which 
ran to the east, and even came close to the point ; and I 
took the more notice of it, because I saw there might be 
some danger that, when I came into it, I might be carried 
cut to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to make the 
island again : and, indeed, had I not got first upon this hill, 
I believe it would have been so ; for there was the same 
current on the other side the island, only that it set off at a 
farther distance, and I saw there was a strong eddy under 
the shore : so I had nothing to do but to get out of the first 
current, and I should presently be in an eddy. 

I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing 
pretty fresh at E.S.E., and that being just contrary to the 
said current, made a great breach of the sea upon fthe point ; 
so that it was not safe for me to keep too close to the shore, 
for the breach, nor to go too far off, because of the stream. 

The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated 
over night, the sea was calm, and I ventured ; but I am a 
warning-piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots : for no 
sooner was I come to the point, when I was not even my 
boat's length from the shore, but I found myself in a great 
depth of water, and a current like the sluice of a mill ; it 
carried my boat along with it with such violence, that all 1 
30uld do could not keep her so much as on the edge of it ; 
but I found it hurried me farther and farther out from tbe 
eddy, which was on my left hand. There was no wind stir- 
ting to help me, and all I could do with my paddles dgnified 
nothing : and now I began to give myself over for lost ; fo 
US the current was on both sides of the island, I knew in a 
few leagues* distance they must join again, and then I war 
irrecoverably gone ; nor did I see any possiblity of avoiding 



t66 ADVENTURES OF 

It ; 80 that I had no prospect before me bttt of perishing 
not by the sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving foi 
hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the shore, as big 
ilmost as I could lift, and had tossed it into the boat ; and I 
had a great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my 
I'arthen pots ; but what was all this to being driven into the 
vast ocean, where, to be sure, there was no shore, no main 
land or island, for a thousand leagues at least ? 

And now 1 saw how easy it was for the providence of Qod 
to make even the most miserable condition of mankind 
worse. Now I looked back upon my desolate, solitary 
island as the most pleasant place in the world ; and all the 
happiness my heart could wish for was to be but there again. 
I stretched out my hands to it, with eager wishes : O happy 
desert ! said I, 1 shall never see thee more. O miserable 
creature ! whither am I going ! Then I reproached myself 
with my unthankful temper, and how I had repined at my 
solitary condition ; and now what would I give to be on 
shore there again ! Thus we never see the true state of our 
condition till it is illustrated to us by its contraries, nor 
know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it 
It is scarce possible to imagine the consternation I was now 
in, being driven from my beloved island (for so it appeared 
to me now to be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues, 
and in the utmost despair of ever recovering it again. How- 
ever, I worked hard, till indeed my strength was almost 
exhausted, and kept my boat as much to the northward, that 
is, towards the side of the current which the eddy lay on, m 
possibly I could ; when about noon, as the sun passed thn 
ineridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face, 
upringing up from S.S.E. This cheered my heart a little, 
and especially when, in about half an hour more, it blew k 
pretty gentle gale. By this time I was got at a frightful 
distance from the island, and had the least cloudy or hazy 
weather intervened, T had been undone another way too 



K0BIN80N CRUSOE. 107 

Ibr I aad no ompass on board, and should nrv»:r havf 
known how to have steered towards the island, if I hj»d but 
once lost sight of it ; but the weather continuing dear, ) 
applied myself to get up my mast again, and spread my 
sail, standing away to the north as much as possible, to g»i 
out of the current. 

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to 
stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of the water some 
alteration of the current was near ; for where the current 
««as so strong, the water was foul ; but perceiving the watei 
clear, I found the current abate ; and presently I found to 
the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some 
tocks : these rocks I found caused the current to part again, 
and as the main stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving 
the rocks to the north-east, so the other returned by the 
repulse of the rocks, and made a strong eddy, which ran 
back again to the north-west, with a very sharp stream. 

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought t 
them upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just 
going to murder them, or who have been in such-like 
extremities, may guess what my present surprise of joy was, 
and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy ; 
andu the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail 
to it, running cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong 
tide or eddy under foot. 

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back 
again, directly towards the island, but about two leagues 
more to the northward than the current which carried mc 
%way at first : so that when I came near the island, I found 
myself open to the northern shore of it, that is £o say, the 
other end of the island, opposite to that which I went out 
from. 

When I had made something more than a Ic tgue of way 
by the help of this current or eddy, I found it was spent, 
ind soivisd me no farther. However, I found that being 



[ei ADVENTURES OP 

between two great currents, viz., that on tlie south sidi^ 
which h^il hurried me away, and that on the north, which 
lay about a league on the other side ; I say, between these 
two, in the wake of the island, I found the water at least 
still, and running no way ; and having still a breeze of wind 
dir to me, 1 kept on steering directly for the island, though 
D )t making such fresh way as I did before. 

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within a 
1 ^'igue of the island, I found the point of the rocks which 
occasioned this disaster stretching out, as is described before, 
to the southward, and casting off the current more southerly, 
had, of course, made another eddy to the north ; and this I 
found very strong, but not directly setting the way my course 
ay, which was due west, but almost full north. However, 
oaving a fresh gale I stretched across this eddy, slanting 
nurth-west ; and, in about an hour, came within about a 
mile of the shore, where, it being smooth, I soon got to land. 

When 1 was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God 
thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts ol 
my deliverance by my boat ; and refreshing myself with such 
things as I had, I brought my boat close to the shore, in a 
little cove that I had spied under some trees, and laid me 
down to sleep, being quite spent with the labor and fatigue 
of the voyage. 

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my 
boat : I had run so much hazard, and knew too much of the 
case, to think of attempting it by the way I went out ; and 
what might be at the other side (I mean the west side) I 
knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures ; so 
I only resolved in the morning to make my way westwuid 
nlong the shore, and see if there was no creek where I might 
"ay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again, if 1 
wanted her. In about three miles, or thereabout, coafting 
he shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay, about a mill 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. iq« 

oter, which narrowed till it came to a very little rivuUt oi 
brook, where I found a very convenient harbor for my boat, 
and where she lay as if she had been in a little dock male 
on purpose for her. Here I put in, and having stowed my 
boat very safe, I went on shore, to look about me, and «ee 
where I was. 

1 soon found I had but a little passed by the place where 
I had been before when 1 travelled on foot to that shore ; so 
taking nothing out of my boat but my gun and umbrella, 
tor it was exceeding hot, I began my march. The way wan 
comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had been upon, 
and 1 reached my old bower in the evening, where I found 
everything standing as I had left it ; for I always kept 
it in good order, being, as I said before, my country house. 

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to 
rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep : but 
judge you, if you can, that read my story, what a surprise I 
must be in, when 1 was awoked out of my sleep By a voice, 
calling me by my name several times, Robin, Robin, Robin, 
Crusoe ; poor Robin Crusoe ! Where are you, Robin Crusoe ? 
Where are you ? Where have you been } 

T was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing 
or paddling as it is called, the first part of the day, and with 
walking the latter part, that I did not wake thoroujjhly ; but 
dozing between sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed 
that somebody spoke to me ; but as the voice continued to 
repeat Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, at last I began to wake 
more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened, and 
staTted up in the utmost constt mation ; but no sooner were 
my eyes open, but I saw my PcU sitting on the top of the 
hedge ; and immediately knew it was he that spoke to me : 
for just in such bemoaning language I had used to talk to 
itim, and teach him ; and he had learned it so perfectly, that 
he would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill dose to my &ce^ 



170 ADVENTUKBS OF 

ind cry, Poor Robin Crusoe ; Where are } ou * Wh« 
aave you been ? How came you here ? and such things as i 
had taught him. 

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that 
indeed it could be nobody else, it was a good while before I 
could compose myself. First, I was amazed hew the crea- 
ture got thither ; and then how he should just keep about 
the place, and nowhere else ; but as I was well satisfied it 
could be nobody but honest Poll, I got over it ; and holding 
out my hand, and calling him by his name. Poll, the sociable 
creature came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to 
do, and continued talking to me. Poor Robin Crusoe ! and 
how did 1 come here } and where had 1 been ? just as if he 
had been overjoyed to see me again : and so I carried him 
home along with me. 

I now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and 
had enough to do for many days to sit still, and to reflect 
upon the danger I had been in. I would have been very 
glad to have had my boat again on my side of the island ; 
but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about. As 
to the east side of the island, which I had gone round, I 
knew well enough there was no venturing that way ; my 
very heart would shrink, and my very blood run chill, but 
to think^f it ; and as to the other side of the . island, I ditl 
not know how it might be there ; but supposing the current 
ran with the same force against the shore at the east as it 
passed by it on the other, I might run the same risk of being 
driven down the stream, and carried by the island, as I haa 
been before of being carried away from it; so, with these 
thoughts, 1 contented myself to be without any boat, though 
it had been the product of so many months* labor to makt 
it, and of so many more to get it into the sea. 

In this government of my temper I remain«>.d near a year 
lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose 
tad my thoughts being very much composed, as to my con*

iitica and fully comforted in resigning myself to tte dis« 
posiHons of ProvideEce, I tnough I lived really very ha^pHy 
in aU things except that of society. 

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic ex- 
erd^es which my necessities put me upon applying myseU 
to ; and I believe I could, upon occasion, have made a very 
goc4 carpenter, especially considering how few tools I had. 

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my 
earthen-ware, and contrived well enough to make them with 
a wheel, which I found infinitely easier and better ; because 
^ made things round and shapeable, which before were filthy 
things indeed to look upon. But I think I was never more 
vain of my own performance, or more joyful for anything I 
found out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe ; 
and though it was a very ugly clumsy thing when it was 
done, and only burned red, like other earthenware, yet as it 
was hard and firm, and would draw the smoke, I was 
exceedingly comforted with it, for I had been always used 
to smoke : and there were pipes in the ship, but I forgot 
I hem at first, not thinking that there was tobacco in the 
iiland ; and afterwards, when I searched the ship again, I 
rould not come at any pipes at all. 

In my wicker-ware also I improved much, and made 
abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my invention 
showed me ; though not very handsome, yet they were such 
as were very handy and convenient for my laying things up 
in, or fetching things home. For example, if I killed a goat 
abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, dress it, and cut 
it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket ; and the like by 
a turtle ; I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or 
two of the flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them 
home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also large 
deep baskets for the receivers of my com, which I alwayi 
rubbed out as soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it ii 
great baskets

It happened one day, about noon, going towards ray boat, 1 
was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man*8 naked 
foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen in the 
sand. I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an 
apparition : I listened, I looked round me, but I could hear 
nothing, nor see anything ; I went up to a rising ground, to 
look farther ; I went up the shore and down the shore, but 
it was all one ; I could see no other impression but that orf . 
I went to it again to see if there were any more, and to 
observe if it might not be my fancy ; but there was no room 
for that, for there was exactly the print of a foot, toes, 
heel, and every part of a foot : how it came thither, I knew 
not, nor could I in the least imagine ; but, after innumerable 
fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly con^aed and out of 
myself, I came home to my fortification, not feeling, as we 
say, the ground I went on, but terrified to the last degree ; 
looking behind me at every two or three steps, mistaking 
every bush and tree, and fancying every stump at a distance 
to be a man. Nor is it possible to describe how many 
rarious shapes my afirighted imagination represented things 
to me in, how many wild ideas were found every moment in 
my fancy, and what strange unaccountable whimsies caux! 
into my thoughts by the way. 

"^Vhen I came to my castle (for so I think I called it e vet 
after this), I fled into it like one pursued ; whether I went 
over by the ladder, as first contrived, or went in at the hole

no, ncr could 1 remember the next morning ; for nevei

(righ\ened hare fled to cover, or fox to earth with moie tei 
lor of mind than I to this retreat. 

1 slept none that night : the farther I was from the occa- 
sion of my fright, the greater my apprehensions were ; which 
18 something contrary to the nature of such things, and 
especially to the usual practice of all creatures in fear ; but 
I was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas of the 
thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to 
myself, even though I was now a' great way off it. Sometimes 
I fancied it must be the Devil, and reason joined in with me 
upon this supposition ; for how should any other thing in 
human shape come into the place ? Where was the vessel 
that brought them ? What marks were there of any other 
footsteps ? And how was it possible a man should come there ? 
But then to think that Satan should take human shape upon 
him in such a place, where there could be no manner of 
occasion for it, but to leave the print of his foot behind him, 
and that even for no purpose too, for he could not be sure 
I should see it, — this was an amusement the other way. 
I considered that the Devil might have found out abundance 
of other ways to have terrified me than this of the single 
print of a foot ; that as I lived quite on the other side of the 
island, he would never have been so simple as to leave a 
mark in a place where it was ten thousand to one whether I 
should ever see it or not, and in the sand too, which the 
first surge of the sea, upon a high wind, would have defaced 
entirely : all this seemed inconsistent with the thing itself, 
acd with all the notions we usually entertain of the subtlety 
of the Devil. 

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me 
V'i\ of all apprehensions of its being the Devil ; and 1 
pre82ntly concluded, then, that it must be some more dangei- 
i)U8 creature, viz., that it must be some of the savages of the 
main land over against me, who had wandered out to sea in 
t»«ir '^anoei, and, either driven by the currents or by contrail

winds, had made tne island, zxnd had been on shore, liut iier« 
gone away again to sea ; being as loth, perhaps, to have 
stayed in this desolate island as I would have been to have 
had them. 

While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I waa 
very thankful in my thoughts that I was so happy as not to 
be thereabouts at that time, or that they did not see my boat, 
by which they would have concluded that some inhabitants 
had been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther for 
me : then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about 
their having found my boat, and that there were people here ; 
and that if so, I should certainly have them come again in 
greater numbers, and devour me : that if it should happen 
so that they should not find me, yet they would find my 
enclosure, destroy all my com, and carry away all my flock 
of tame goats, and I should perish at last for mere want. 

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that 
former confidence in God, which was founded upon such 
wonderful experience as I had had of his goodness, as if he 
that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not preserve, by 
his power, the provision which he had made for me by his 
goodness. I reproached myself with my laziness, that would 
not sow any more corn one year than would just serve me 
till the next season, as if no accident would intervene to 
prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground ; 
and this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for the 
future to have two or three years* com beforehand, so that, 
whatever might come, I might not perish for want of bread

jnaginable ; for I, whose only affliction was that 1 seemen* 
banished from human society, that 1 was alone, circumscribed 
by the boundless ocean, cut off from mankind,, and con 
demned to what I called silent life ; that I was as one whom 
Heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the 
living, or to appear among the rest of his creatures ; that to 
have seen one of my own species would have seemed to me 
a rabing me from death to life, and the greatest blessing that 
Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation, 
could bestow ; I say, that I should now tremble at the very 
apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to sink into 
the ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a 
man*s having set his foot in the island. 

Such is the uneven state of human life ; and it afforde 1 
me a great many curious speculations afterwards, when 1 
had a little recovered my first surprise. I considered that 
this was the station of life the infinitely wise and good 
providence of God had determined for me ; that as I could 
not foresee what the ends of divine wisdom might be in all 
this, so I was not to dispute his sovereignty, who, as I was 
his creature, had an undoubted right, by creation, to govern 
and dispose of me absolutely as he thought fit ; and who, as 
I was a creature that had offended him, had likewise a 
mdicial right to condemn me to what punishment he thought 
5t ; and that it was my part to submit to bear his indigna- 
tion, because I had sinned against him. I then reflected, 
that as God, who was not only righteous, but omnipotent, 
l^ad thought fit thus to punish and afflict me, so he was able 
tc deliver me ; that if he did not think fit to do so, it was my 
unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely 
tv) his will ; and, on the other hand, it was my duty also to 
hope in him, pray to him, and quietly to attend the dictate! 
•nd directions of his daily providence.

eogitationii oi this occasion I cannot omit. One morning 
ftarly, lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts about ui} 
danger from the appearances of savages, I found it discern- 
posed me very much ; upon which these words of the Scrip 
ture came into my thoughts : *' Call upon me in the day oi 
trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.*' 
Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart wa* 
not o^y comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to 
pray earnestly to God for deliverance : when I had done 
praying, 1 took up nay Bible, and opening it to read, the first 
vroT^s that presented to me were, " Wait on the Lord, and 
be of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart ; wait, ] 
say, on the Lord." It is impossible to express the comfor 
this gave me. In answer, I thankfully laid down the book, 
and was no more sad, at least on that occasion. 

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and 
refiections, it came into my thoughts one day, that all this 
might be a mere chimera of my own, and that this foot 
might be the print of my own foot, when I came on shore 
fi-om my boat : this cheered me up a little too, and I began to 
persuade myself it was all a delusion ; that it was nothing 
else but my own foot : and why might I not come that way 
firom the boat, as well as 1 was going that way to the boat ? 
Again, I considered also, that I could by no means tell, foi 
certain, where I had trod, and where I had not ; and that if, 
at last, this was only the print of my own foot, I had played 
the part of those fools, who try to make stories of spectres 
and apparitions, and then are frightened at them more than 
anybody. 

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, 
for I >.%i not stirred out of my castle for three days and 
nights, so that I began to starve for provisions ; for I had 
little or nothing within doors but some barley cakes and 
•rater : then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked Uk), 
w\jch usi^ly was my evening diversion ; and the pooi 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 187 

creatures were in great pain and inconvenience for waut of 
it : and, indeed, it almost spoiled some of them, and almost 
dried up their milk. Encoiflraging myself, therefo"^, with 
^e belief that this was nothing but the print of one of my 
own feet, and that I might be truly said to start at my own 
shadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to my 'iountry 
house to milk my flock : but to see with what fear I went 
forward, how often I looked behind me, how I wat* ready, 
every now and then, to lay down my basket, and run for my 
life, it would have made any one think I was haunted with 
an evil conscience, or that 1 had been lately most terribly 
frightened ; and so, indeed, I had. However, ag I went 
down thus two or three days, and having seen nothing; 1 
began to be a little bolder, and to think there was really 
nothing in it but my own imagination ; but I could not 
persuade myself fully of this till I should go down to the 
shore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it by 
aay own, and see if there was any similitude or fitness, that 
I might be assured it was my own foot : but when I came to 
the place, first, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid 
up my boat, I could not possibly be on shore anywhere 
thereabout : secondly, when I came to measure the mark 
with my own foot, I found my foot not so large by a great 
deal. Both these things filled my head with new imagina- 
tions, and gave me the vapors again to the highest degree, 
so that I shook with cold like one in an ague ; and I went 
home again, filled with the belief that some man or men had 
been on shore there ; or, in short, that the island wa? 
inhabited, and I might be surprised before I was aware ; 
and what course to take for my security I knew not. 

O, what ridiculous resolutions men take when possesseJ 
with fear ! It deprives them of the use of those means 
which reason offers for their relief. The first thing I pro- 
posed to myself was, to throw down my enclosureR, and turn 
»]. my tam? cattle wild into the woods, lest the enemj 



Igg ADVENTURES OF 

•honld find the n, and then frequent the island in prospoei 
of the same or the like booty : then to the simple thing o 
digging up my two cornfields, lest they should find such a 
grain there, and still be prompted to frequent the island * 
then to demolish my bower and tent, that they might not 
see any vestiges of habitation, and be prompted to look 
farther, in order to find out the persons inhabiting. 

These were the subject of the first night's cogitations aftei 
1 was come home again, while the apprehensions which had 
BO overrun my mind were fresh upon me, and my head waa 
full of vapors, as above. Thus fear of danger is ten thou- 
sand times more terrifying than danger itself when apparent 
to the *iyes ; and we find the burden of anxiety greater, by 
much, thai! the evil which we are anxious about : and, which 
was worse than all this, I had not that relief in this trouble 
from the resignation I used to practise, that I hoped to have. 
I looked, I thought, like Saul, who complained not only that 
the Philistines were upon him, but that God had forsaken 
him ; for I did not now take due ways to compose my mind, 
by crying to Ood in my distress, and resting upon his 
providence, as I had done before, for my defence and 
deliverance ; which, if I had done, I had at least been more 
cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and perhapf 
carried through it >vith more resolution. 

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night ; 
out in the morning I fell asleep ; and having, by the amuse- 
nent of my mind, been as it were tired, and my spirits 
exhausted, I slept very soundly, and waked much bettei 
•5onr.p:s3d than I had ever been before. And now I began 
to think sedately ; and, upon the utmost debate with rojself^ 
[ concluded that this island, which was so exceeding pleapant, 
fruitful, and no farther from the main land than as I had 
seen, was not so entirely abandoned as 1 might imagine; 
hat although there were no st5.ted inhabitants who lived on 
ilie spct, yet that there might sometimes come boats off froni 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. |5f 

ttie shore, who, either with design, or perhaps nevtx but 
when they were driven by cross winds, might coae to thU 
place ; that I had lived here fifteen years naw, and had not 
met with the least shadow or figure of any people yet ; and 
that if at any time they shotdd be driven here, it was 
probable they went away again as soon as ever they could, 
seeing they had never thought fit to fix here upon any 
occasion ; that the most I could suggest any danger from, 
WSLS from any casual accidental landing of straggling people 
firom the main, who, as it was likely, if they were driven 
hither, were here against their wills, so they made no stay 
here, but went off" again with all possible speed ; seldom 
staying one night on shore, lest they should not have the 
help of the tides and daylight back again ; and that, there- 
fore, I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe 
retreat, in case I should see any savages land upon the spot. 
Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so 
large as to bring a door through again, which doer, as 1 
said, came out beyond where my fortification joined to the 
rock : upon maturely considering this, therefore, I resolved 
to draw me a second fortification, in the same mannei of a 
semicircle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had 
planted a double row of trees about twelve years before, of 
which I made mention : these trees having been planted so 
thick before, they wanted but few piles to be driven between 
them, that they might be thicker and stronger, and mj wall 
would be soon finished : so that I had now a double wall: 
and my outer wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old 
cables, and everything I could think of, to make it strong, 
having in it seven little holes, about as big as I might pn* 
my arm out at. In the inside of this, I thickened my wall 
to about ten feet thick, with continually bringing earth out 
of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and walk- 
ing upon it; and through the seven holes I contrived to 
plant ^e muskets, of which I took notice that I had go' 



190 ADVENTURES OF 

seven on shore out of the ship: these I plavUnl Lit m? 
cannon, aild fitted them into frames, that held them like )» 
carriage, so that I could fire all the seven guns in two 
minutes* time: this wall I was many a weary month in 
Hnishing, and yet never thought myself safe till it was done. 

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my 
wall, for a great length every way, a8 full with stakes, or 
iticks, of the osier-like wood, which J found so apt to grow, 
M tliey could well stand ; insomuch, that I believe I migh : 
set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large 
space between them and my wall, that 1 might have room to 
see an enemy, and they might have no shelter from the 
young trees, if they attempted to approach my outer wall. 

Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove ; and in five 
or six years' time I had a wood before my dwelling, growing 
BO monstrous thick and strong, that it was indeed perfectly 
impassable ; and no men, of what kind soever, would ever 
imagine that there was anything beyond it, much less a 
habitation. As for the way which I proposed to myself to 
go in and out (for I left no avenue), it was by setting two 
ladders, one to a part of the rock which was low, and then 
broke in, and left room to place another ladder upon that : 
8o when the two ladders were taken down, no man living 
could come down to me without doing himself mischief; 
and if they had come down, they were still on the outside^ 
>f my outer wall. 

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could 
suggest for my own preservation ; and it will be seen, at 
length, that they were not altogether without just reason, 
though I foresaw nothing at tha^ time more than my mer« 
fear suggested to me. 

Wliile this was doing, I was not altogether careless of m^i 
ather affairs : for I had a great concern upon me for my 
little herd of goats ; they were not only a ready supply to 
me on every occasion, and began to be sufficient for me^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 19fl 

the more proper frame for prayer than that ol terror and 
discomposure ; anMbat under the dread of mischief impend- 
ing, a man is no more fit for a comforting performance of the 
duty of praying to God, than he is for a repentance on a 
sick bed ; for these discomposures affect the mind, as the 
othei s^ do the body ; and the discomposure of the mind must 
necessarily be a» great a disability as that of the body, and 
n)ii:h greater: praying to God being properly an act of the 
mind, not of the body. 

But to go on : after I had thus secured one part of my 
iittle li\'ing stock, I went about the whole island, searchinp 
for another private place to make such another deposit; 
when, wandering more to the west point of the island than 
I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I tLought I saw 
a boat upon the sea, at a great distance. I had found a 
perspective glass or two in one of the seamen's chests, which 
I saved out of our ship, but I had it not about me ; and this 
was so remote, that I could not tell what to make of it, 
though I looked at it till my eyes were not able to hold to 
look any longer: whether it was a boat or not, I do not 
itnow, but as I descended from the hill I could see no more 
of it ; so I gave it over ; only I resolved to go no more out 
without a perspective glass in my pocket. When I was 
come down the hill to the end of the island, where, indeed, 
1 had never been before, I was presently convinced that the 
seeing the print of a man's foot was not such a strange thinj/ 
in the island as I imagined : and, but that it was a special 
providence that I was cast upon the fide of the island where 
the savages never came, I should easily have known tha» 
nothing was more frequent than for the canoes jrom the 
main, when they happened to be a little too far out at sea, 
to shoot over to that side of the island for harbor ; likemse. 
as they often met and fought in their canoes, the victors, 
having taken any prisoners, would bring them over to thin 
•hore, where, according, to their dreadfril customs, being 
17 



194 ADVENTURES OF 

all cannibals, they would kill and eat them ; of which hen?' 
after. « 

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said 
above, '^eing the south-west point of the island, I was per- 
fectly confounded and amazed ; nor is it po§sible for me tu 
express the horror of my mind, at seeing the shore spread 
wi h skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies ; 
ir i, particularly, I observed a place where there had been a 
fire made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where 
J supposed the savage wretches had sat down to their inhu- 
man feastings upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures. 

I was 80 astonished with the sight of these things, that 1 
entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a 
long while : all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughUi 
of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horrot 
of the degeneracy of human nature, which, though I had 
heard of it often, yet I never had so near a view of before ; 
in short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle 
my stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of faint- 
ing, when nature discharged the disorder from my stomach ; 
and having vomited with imcommon violence, I was a little 
relieved, but could not bear to stay in the place a moment ; 
so I got me up the hill again mth all the speed I could, and 
walked on towards my own habitation. 

AVhen I came a little out of that part of the island, ) 
t^lood still awhile, as amazed, and then recovering myself 
I looked up with the utmost affection of my soul, and, with 
1 flood of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had ca^k 
my first lot in a part of the world where I was distinguishc 1 
fr>m such dreadful creatures as these; and that, though i 
had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had yet 
^iven me so many comforts in it, that I had still more to 
i^ive thanks for than to complain of; and this, above all, 
that 1 had, even in this miserable condition, been comforted 
with the kncwledge of Himself, and the hope of His hhia* 



ROBINSON CRUSOJB. |9t 

ling, whidi was a felicity more than sufficiently cquivaleni 
to all the misery which I had suffered or could suffer. 

Id this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle 
and began to be much easier now, as to the safety of raj 
circumstances, than ever I was befor/> ; for I observed that 
these wretches never came to this island in search of what 
they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not 
expecting, anything here, and having often, no doubt, been 
up in the covered woody part of it, without finding anything | 
to their purpose. I knew I had been here now almost 
eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps of human 
creature there before ; and I might be eighteen years moie 
as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover 
myself to them, which I had no manner of occasion to do \ 
it being my only business to keep myself entirely concealec' 
where I was, unless I found a better sort of creatures than 
cannibals to make myself known to. Yet 1 entert^^ined 
siich an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I have been 
speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman custom of theii 
devouring and eating one another up, that I continued pen- 
sive and sad, and kept close within my own circle, for almost 
two years after this ; when I say my own circle, I mean by 
it my three plantations, viz., my castle, my countoy seat, 
which I called my bower, and my enclosure in the woods : 
nor did I look after this for any other use than as an enclo- 
sure for my goats ; for the aversion which nature gave me to 
•Jiese hellish wretches was such, that I was as fearful of see- 
ing them as of seeing the Devil himself. I did not so much 
as go to look after my boat all this time, but began rather 
to think of making me another; for I could not think oi 
ever making any more attempts to bring the other boat 
round the island to me, lest I should meet with pome o\ 
,hese creatures at sea ; in which if I had happened to have 
fallen into *heir hands, I knew what would have been mj 
Wt. 



^1^6 ADVENTURES OF 

Time, however, and the satisfaction 1 had tLat I wat m 
to danger uf being discovered by these people, began to 
wear oflf my uneasiness about tLom ; and I began to live 
just in the same compobcd manner as before, only with this 
difference, that I used more caution, and kept my eyes more 
about me, than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen 
by any of them; and particularly, I was more cautious ol 
Sring my gun, lest any of them being on the island should 
happen to hear it. It was therefore a very good providence 
to me that I had furnished myself with a tame breed ol 
poats, and that I had no need to hunt any more about the 
woods, or shoot at them ; and if I did catch any of them 
after this, it was by traps and snares, as I had done before : 
Bo that for two years after this, I believe I never fired my 
gun off, though 1 never went out without it ; and, which 
was more, as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, ] 
always carried them out with me, or at least two of them, 
sticking them in my goat's-skin belt. I also furbished up 
one of the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and 
made me a belt to hang it on also ; so that I was now a 
most formidable fellow to look at when I went abroad, if 
you add to the former description of myself, the particular 
of two pistols, and a great broadsword hanging at my side 
ui a belt, but without a scabbard. 

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, J 
seemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my 
former calm sedate way of living. All these things tended 
to show me more and more, how far my condition was from 
being miserable, compared to some others ; nay, to many 
jther particulars of life, which it might have pleased God tc 
have made my lot. It put me upon reflecting how little 
repining there would be among mankind at any condition

those that were worse, in order to be thankful, than bf

Assist their murmurings and complainlugs. 

As in my present condition there were not really many 
fhings which I wanted, so, indeed, I thought that the frights 
I had been in about these savage wretches, and the concern 
I had been in for my own preservation, had taken off the edge 
of my invention for my ovm conveniences ; and I had 
dropped a good design, which I had once bent my thoughts 
too much upon, and that was, to try if I could not make 
some of my barley into malt, and then try to brew myseH 
some beer. This was ^eall3^ a whimsical thought, and 1 
reproved myself often for the simplicity of it ; for I presently 
saw there would be the want of several things necessary to 
the making my beer, that it would be impossible for me to 
supply ; as, first, casks to preserve it in, which was a thing 
that, as I had observed already, I could never compass ; no, 
though 1 spent not only many days, but weeks, nay, months, 
in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next place, I 
had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no 
copper or kettle to make it boil ; and yet, with all these 
things wanting, I verily believe, had not the frights and ter- 
rors I was in about the savages intervened, I had undertaken 
it, and perhaps brought it to pass too ; for I seldom gave 
anything over without accomplishing it, when once I had it 
in my head to begin it. But my invention now ran quite 
another way ; for, night and day, I could think of nothing 
' nt how I might destroy some of these monsters in theii 
cruel, bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the victim 
they should bring hither to destroy. It would take up ii 
larger volume than this whole work is intended to be, to sel 
down all the contrivances I hatched, or rather brooded upcn, 
ji my thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at 
least frightening them so as to prevent their coming hithei

klble u) take effect, unless 1 was to be there to do it ityself ; 
and what could one man do among them, when perhapj 
^here might be twenty or thirty of them together, with theit 
uarts, or .their bows and arrows, with which they could shoot 
as true to a mark as I could with my gun ? 

Sometimes I thought of digging a hole under the place 
where they made their fire, and putting in five or six pounds 
of gunpowder, which, when they kindled their fire, would 
consequently take fire, and blow up all that was near it ; 
but as, in the first place, I should be unwilling to waste so 
much powder upon them, my store being now within the 
quantity of one barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going 
off at any certain time, when it might surprise them : and, 
at best, that it would do little more than just blow the fire 
about their ears and fright them, but not sufficient to make 
them forsake the place ; so I laid it aside ; and then pro- 
posed that I would place myself in ambush in some con- 
venient place, with my three guns all double-loaded, and, in 
the middle of their bloody ceremony, let fly at them, when I 
should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at 
every shot : and then falling in upon them with my three 
pistols, and my sword, I made no doubt but that if there 
were twenty I should kill them all. This fancy pleased my 
thoughts for some weeks ; and 1 was so full of it, that 1 
often dreamed of it, and sometimes that I was just going to 
let fly at them in my sleep. 1 went so far with it in my 
imagination, that I employed myself several days to find out 
proper places to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to watch 
for them ; and I went frequently to the place itself, which 
was now grown more familiar to me : but while my mind was 
thus filled with thoughts of revenge, and a bloody putt'ng 
twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as I may call it, the 
horror I had at the place, and at the signals of the bar- 
barous wretches devouring one another, abetted my malice. 
W«Uy at length, I found a place in the side of the hill, when 



ROBINSON CRLSOE. 19() 

I was satisfied ^ might securelj- wait till I saw any ol theb 
ooats cominp: ; and might then, even before they would be 
ready to come on shore, convey myself, unseen, into som« 
thickets of trees, in one of which there was a hollow large 
enough to conceal me entirely ; and there I might sit and 
observe all their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their 
beads, when they were so close together, as that it would } e 
next to impossible that I should miss my shot, or that J 
could fail wounding three or four of them at the first shot 
In this place, then, I resolved to fix my design; and, 
accordingly, I prepared two muskets and my ordinary 
fowling-piece. The two muskets I loaded with a brace of 
slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets, about the size 
of pistol-bullets ; and the fowling-piece I loaded with near 
a handful of swan-shot, of the largest size : I also loaded 
my pistols with about four bullets each ; and in this posture, 
well provided with ammunition for a second and third 
charge, I prepared myself for my expedition. 

After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and, in my 
Imagination, put it in practice, 1 continually made my tour 
overy morning up to the top of the hill, which was firom my 
Cdstle, as I called it, about three miles, or more, to see if I 
tould observe any boats upon the sea, coming near the island, 
Of standing over towards it : but I began to tire of this hard 
Quty, after I had, for two or three months, constantly kept 
my watch, but came always back without any discovery : 
there having not in all that time, been the least appear- 
ance, not only on and near the shore, but on the whole 
xjean, so far as my eyes or glasses cculd reach every 
way. 

As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out, so 
long also I kept up the vigor of my design, and my spirita

discusfiion of in my thoughts, any further than my pa»Aloin 
were at first fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural 
custom of the people of that country ; who, it seems, had 
been suffered by Providence, in his wise disposition of the 
world, to have no other guide than that of their own abomi" 
nable and vitiated passions ; and, consequently, were left, anc3 
perhaps had been so for some ages, to act such honid tLings, 
and receive such dreadful customs, as nothing but nature, 
entirely abandoned by Heaven, and actuated by some hellish 
degeneracy, could have run them into. But now, when, as 
1 have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless excursion, 
which I had made so long and so far every morning in vain, 
so my opinion of the action itself began to alter ; and 1 
began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what J 
was going to eng^e in: what authority or call I had to 
pretend to be judge and executioner upon these men as 
criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit, for so many ages, 
to suffer, unpunished, to go on, and to be, as it were, the 
executioners of his judgments one upon another. How far 
these people were offenders against me, and what right 1 had 
to engage in the quarrel of that blood which they shed pro- 
miscuously one upon another, I debated this very often with 
myself, thus : How do I know what God himself judges in 
this particular case ? It is certain these people do not 
commit this as a crime ; it is not against their own con- 
sciences reproving, or their light reproaching them ; they do 
not know it to be an offence, and then commit it in defiance 
of divine justice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit 
rhey think it no more a crime to kill a capuve taken in war, • 
than we do to kill an ox ; nor to eat human flesh, than no 
da to eat mutton. 

When I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that 
I was certainly in the wrong in it ; that these people wer j 
not murderers ii the sense that I had before condemned them

ierers wlio often put to death the prisoners taken in battle , 
or more frequently, upon many occasions put whole troopi 
of men to the sword, without giving quartei, though they 
threw down their arms and submitted. In the next place 
it occurred to me, that althoi^gh the usage the) gave one 
an:ther was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it ^as really 
nothing to me ; these people had done me no injury : that 
if they attempted me, or I saw it necessary, for my immediate 
jTreservation, to fall upon them, something might be said fpi 
it ; but that I was yet out of their power, and they really 
had no knowledge of me, and consequently no design upon 
me ; and therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon 
them : that this would justify the conduct of the SpaAiards 
in all their barbarities practised in America, where they 
destrdyed millions of these people : who, ^wever they were 
idolaters and barbarians, and had several bloody and barbar- 
ous rites in their customs, such as sacrificing human bodier 
to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent 
people ; and that the rooting them out of the country is 
spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detestation by 
even the Spaniards themselves at this time, and by all other 
Christian nations in Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody 
and unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustificable either to God 
or man, and for which the very name of a Spaniard is 
reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all people of human- 
ity, or of Christian compassion, — as if the kingdom of 
Spain were particularly eminent for the produce of a race o* 
men who were without principles of tenderness, or the com* 
mon bowels of pity to the miserable, which is reckoned to 
h5 a mark of generous temper in the mind. 

Th38e considerations really put me to a pause, and to a 
Vind of a full stop ; and I began, by little and little, to be 
off' my design, and to conclude I had taken wrong measure! 
In :ay resolutions to attack the savages ; and that it was not 
my business ^ meddle ^vith them, unless they first attacked 



202 ADVENTURES OF 

me ; and that it was my business, if possible, to preven ; 
but that if I were discovered and attacked by them, I knew 
my duty. On the other hand, I argued with myself, that thii 
really was the way not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin 
and destroy myself ; for unless I was sure to kill every one 
that not only should be on shore at that time, but that should 
ever come on shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped 
to tell their country-people what had happened, they would 
come over again by thousands to revenge the death of their 
fellows, and I should only bring upon myself a certain 
destruction, which at present, I had no manner .of occasion 
for. Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in principle 
nor in policy 1 ought, one way or other, to concern myself 
in this affair : that my business was, by all possible means, 
to conceal myse^ from them, and not to leave the least 
signal to them to guess by that there were any living creatures 
upon the island, I mean of human shape. Religion joined 
in with this prudential resolution, and I was convinced now, 
many ways, that 1 was perfectly out of my duty when I 
was laying all my bloody schemes for the destruction of 
innocent creatures, I mean innocent as to me. As to the 
crimes they were guilty of towards one another, I had 
nothing to do mth them ; they were national, and I ought to 
leave them to the justice of God, who is the governor of 
nations, and knows how, by national punishments, to make 
a just retribution for national offences, and to bring public 
judgments upon those who offend in a public manner, hj 
luch ways as best please him. This appeared so clear to ae 
now, that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me than ihai 
I had not been suffered to do a thing which I now saw so 
much reason to believe would have been no less a sin than 
that of wilful murder, if I had committed it; and I gave most 
tKumble thanks on my knees to God, that had thus delivered 
9ie from . blood-guiltiness ; beseeching him to grant me the 
detection of his providence, that I might not fall into the 



ROBINSON CRUSOii. 20^ 

^andfl of the barbarians, or that I might not lay my handi 
on them, unless I had a more clear call from Heaven to 
It, in defence of my own life.

In this disposition I continued for near a year after this ; and 
■o far was I from desiring an occasion fbr falling upon these 
wretches, that in all that time I never once went up the hill 
to see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know 
whether any of them had been on shore there or not, that I 
might not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances agains 
them, or be provoked, by any advantage which might present 
itself, to fall upon them : only this I did, I went and removed 
my boat, which I had on the other side of the island, and 
carrried it down to the east end of the whole island, where 
I ran it into a little cove, which I found under some high 
tocks, and where I knew, by reason of the currents, the 
savages durst not, at least would not, come mth their boats, 
upon any account whatever. With my boat I carried away 
everything that I had left there belonging to her, though nol 
nacessary for the bare going thither, viz., a mast and sail 
iihich I had made for her, and a thing like an anchor, but 
which, indeed, could not be called either anchor or grapnel ; 
aowever, it was the best I could make of its kind ; all these 
removed, that there might not be the least shadow cf ^ny 
discovery, or any appearance of any boat, or of any human 
kabitation, upon the island. Besides this, I kept m^'self, as 
[ naid, more retired than ever, and seldom went from mv cell,

othei than upon my constant employment, viz., to milk mj 
sbe-goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, which ai 
it was quite on the other part of the island, was quite out 
of danger ; for certain it is, that these savage people, who 
sometimes haunted this island, never came with any thoughts 
of finding anything here, and consequently never wandered 
off from the coast ; and I doubt not but they might have 
been several limes on shore after my apprehensions of them 
had made me cautious, as well as before. Indeed, I looked 
back with some horror upon the thoughts of what my 
condi^'on would have been if I had popped upon them and 
been discovered before that, when, naked and unarmed^ 
except with one gun, and that loaded often only with small * 
shot, I walked everywhere, peeping and peering about the 
island to see what I could get ; what a surprise should I 
have been in, if, when I discovered the print of a man's foot, 
I had, instead of that, seen fifteen or twenty savages, and 
found them pursuing me, and by the swiftness of their 
running no possibility of my escaping them ? The thoughts 
of this sometimes sunk my very soul within me, and dis- 
tressed my mind so much, that I could not soon recover it. 
to think what I should have done, and how 1 should not 
only have been unable to resist them, but even should no< 
have had presence of mind enough to do what 1 might hav« 
done, much less what now, after so much consideration and 
preparation, I might be able to do. Indeed, after scriour 
thinking on these things, I would be very melancholy, and 
lometimes it would last a great while ; but I resolved it all, 
at last, into thankfulness to that Providence which had deliv- 
ered me from so many unseen dangers, and had kept from 
me those mischiefe which I could have no way been th« 
agent in delivering myself from, because I had not the least 
notion of any such thing depending, or the least suppositioi 
tf its being r )ssible. I'his renewed a onten-plation whipl 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 206 

often had ^otob to my thoughts in former time when hrst 1 
began to see the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in tlie 
dangers ^ 3 run through in this life ; how wonderfully we are 
dslirered when we know nothing of it; how, when we are 
in (a quandary, as we call it) as doubt or hesitation, whethci 
to go this way, or that way, a secret hint shall direct us tide 
way when we intended to go that way: nay, when* sen je, 
GUI own inclination, and perhaps b.«t>iness, has cdled to go 
the other way, yet a strange impression upon the mind, 
from we know not what springs, and by we know not what 
power, shall overrule us to go this way ; and it shall r.fler- 
wards appear, that had we gone that way which we should 
have gone, and even to our imagination ought to have gone, 
we should have been ruined and lost. Upon these, and many 
like reflections, I afterwards made it a certain rule with me, 
that whenever I found those secret hints or pressings of 
mind, to doing or not doing any thing that presented, or 
going this way or that way, I never failed to obey the secret 
dictate ; though I knew no other reason for it than that such 
a pressure, or such a hint hung upon my mind. I could 
^ve many examples of the success of this conduct in the 
course of my life, but more especially in the latter part of 
my fnhabiting this unhappy island ; besides many occasions 
which it is very likely I might have taken notice of, if I had 
•leen with the same eyes then that I see with now. But it 
IS never too late to be wise ; and I cannot but advise all 
considering men, whose lives are attended with such extra- 
)rdinary incidents as mine, or even though not so extraor- 
iinary, not to slight such secret intimations of Providence, 
let them come from what invisible intelligence they will. 
That I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for ; 
but cer \inly they are a proof of the converse of spirits, and 
ft secret comn unication between those embodied and those 
'inembodied, i nd such a proof as can never be withstood : o^

g06 ADVENTURES OF 

iirhich I shal have occasion to give some very remarkal*!c 
nstances in the remainder of my solitary residence in thij 
dismal place. 

I believe the reader of this will not think it strange A 1 
confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived 
in, and the concern that was now upon me, put an end to all 
inventibn, a.id to all the contrivances that I had laid for my 
future accommodations and conveniences. I had the care ol 
my safety more now upon my hands than that of my food. 
I cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, foi 
fear the noise I might make should be heard; much lesir 
«vould I fire a gun, for the same reason : and, above all, 
was intolerably uneasy at ^^aking any fire, lest the smoke, 
which is visible at a great distance in the day, should betray 
me. For this reason I removed that part of my business 
which required fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, d^c, 
into my new apartment in the woods ; where, after I had 
been some time, I found, to my unspeakable consolation, a 
mere natural cave in the earth, which went in a vast way, 
and where, I dare say, no savage, had he been at the mouth 
of it, would be so hardy as to venture in : nor, indeed, would 
any man else, but one who, like me, wanted nothing so much 
as a safe retreat. 

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great 
rock, where by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see 
abundant reason to ascribe all such things now to Provi- 
dence) I was cutting down some thick branches of trees to 
make charcoal ; and, before I go on, I must observe the 
reason of my making this charcoal, which was thus : I wa? 
afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I said 
before ; and yet I could not live there without baking my 
bread, cooking my meat, &/C. ; so I contrived to burn some 
wood here, as I had seen done in England, under turf, till i 
became chark, or diy coal ; and then putting the fire out, 1 
preseVved the coal to carry home, and perform the otke* 



ROBINSON CRUSOK. 20 1 

services for which fire was wanting, without danger of smoke. 
But this is by the by. While I was cutting down some 
wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick branch oi 
low brushwood, or underwood, there was a kind of hollow 
place : I was curious to look in it, and getting with difficulty 
into the mouth of it, I found it was pretty large : that is to 
lay, sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps 
another with me : but I must confess to ycu that I made 
more haste out than I did in, when, looking farther into the 
place, and which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining 
eyes of some creature, whether devil or man I knew not. 
which twinkled like two stars, the dim light from the cave's 
mouth shining directly in, and maj^ing the reflection. How- 
ever, after some pause, I recovered myself, and began to cal' 
myself a thousand fools, and to think, that he that was 
afraid to see the devil was not fit to live twenty years in an 
island all alone ; and that I might well think there wan 
nothing in this cave that was more frightful than myseli 
Upon this, plucking up my courage, 1 took up a firebrand, 
and in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my hand : 
I had not gone three steps in, but I was almost as much 
frightened as I was before ; for I heard a very loud sigh, 
like that of a man in some pain, and it was followed by a 
broken noise, as of words half expressed, and then a deep 
sigh again. I stepped back, and was indeed struck with 
such a surprise, that it put me into a cold sweat ; and if 1 
had had a hat on my head, I will not answer for it, that my 
hair might not have lifted it off. But still plucking up my 
fipirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a little 
with considering that the power and presence of Gci was 
ftvery where, and was able to protect me, upon this I stepped 
forward again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding .' 
ap a little over my head, I saw lying on the ground a most 
monstrous, frightful, old he-goat, just making his will, at 
we say %nd gasping for life, and dying, indeed, of mere old 



208 ADVENTURES OF 

age. I stirred him a little to see if 1 could get him out \ni 
tie essayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and 
I thought with myself he might even lie there ; for if he had 
frightened me, so he would certainly fright any of the 
lavages, if any of them should be so hardy as to come in 
there while he had any life in him. 

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look 
round vr e, when I found the cave was but very small, that ie 
to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in no manne; 
o^ shape, neither round nor square, no hands having ever 
been employed in making it but those of mere Nature. I 
observed also that there was a place at the farther side of it 
*hut went in further, but was so low that it required me to 
;reep upon. my hands and knees to go into it, and whither it 
went I knew not : so having no candle, 1 gave it over for 
that time ; but resolved to come again the next day, pro 
vided with candles and a tinder-box, which I had made of 
the lock of one of the muskets, with some wild-fire in the 
pan. 

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six lai^e 
candles of my own making (for I made very good candles 
aow of goat's tallow, but was hard set for candle-wick, using 
sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and sometimes the dried rind 
of a weed like nettles) ; and going into this low place, 1 was 
obliged to creep upon all fours, as I have said, almost ten 
yards ; which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold 
nough, considering that I knew not how far it might go, 
nor what Avas beyond it. \Vhen I had got through the 
ntrait, I found the roof rose higher up, I believe near iwf aty 
Loet ; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the island, 
I dare say, as it was, to look round the sides and roof of this 
vault or cave ; the wall reflected a hundred thousand lighta 
to me from my two candles. What it was in the rock, 
whether diamonds, or any other precious stcnes, or gold, 
which I rather supposed it to be, I knew not. The place J 



ROBINSON CRUSOK 201 

WM in was o most delightful cavity or grotco of its kind, at 
could be expected, though perfectly dark ; the floor uas dr) 
and level, and had a sort of a small loose gravel upon it, so 
that there was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen, 
neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof: the 
only difficulty in it was the entrance ; which, however, as it 
was a place of security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I 
thought that was a convenience ; so that I was really rejoiced 
at the discovery, and resolved, without any delay, to biing 
some of those things which I was most anxious about to this 
place ; particularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine 
of powder, and all my spare arms, viz., two fowling-piccos, 
for I had three in all, and three muskets, for of them I had 
eight in all ; so I kept at my castle only five, which stood 
ready mounted like pieces of cannon, on my outmost fence, 
and were ready also to take out upon any expedition. Upon 
this occasion of removing my ammunition, I happened to 
open the barrel of powder which I took up out of the sea, 
and which had been wet ; and I found that the water had 
penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on 
every side, which caking and growing hard, had preserved 
the inside like a kernel in the shell ; so that I had near 
sixty pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask : 
this was a very agreeable discovery to me at that time ; so I 
carried all away thither, never keeping above two or three 
pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise 
of any kind : I also carried thither all the lead I had left for 
bidlets 

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient gianti, whicb 
were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where non* 
could come at them : for I persuaded myself, while I was 
acre, that if five hundred savages were to hunt me, th'^y 
50uld never find me out; or, if they. did, they would not 
venture to attack me here. The old goat, whom I found 
expiring, die<? in the mouth of the cave the next day af^er I

made this discovery : and I found it mxLch. easier to dig 
great hole there, and throw him in and cover him with eaurth 
than to drag him out ; so I interred him tJiere, to preven 
offence to my nose. 

I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in 
this island ; and was so naturalized to the place, and the 
manner of living, that could I have but enjoyed the certainty 
that no savages would come to the place to disturb me, I 
could have been content to have c ipitulated for spending the 
rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had 
laid me down and died, like the old goat in the cave. I 
had also arrived to some little diversions and amusements, 
which made the time pass a great deal more pleasantly with 
me than it did before ; as, first, I had taught my Poll, as I 
noted before, to speak ; and he did it so familiarly, and 
talked so articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to 
me : for I believe no bird ever spoke plainer ; and he lived 
with me no less than six-and-twenty years ; how long he 
might have lived afterwards I know not, though I know 
they have a notion in the Brazils that they live a hundred 
years. My dog was a very pleasant and loving companion 
to me for no less than sixteen years of my time, and then 
'died of mere old age. As for my cats, they multiplied, as 1 
have observed, to that degree, that I was obliged to shoo! 
several of them at first, to keep them firom devouring me 
and all I had ; but, at length, when the two old ones I 
brought with me were gone, and after some time continually 
driving them from me, and letting them have no provision 
with me, they all ran wild into the woods, except two oi 
three favorites, which I kept tame, and whose young, when 
they had any, I always drowned ; and these were part of my 
family. Besides these, I always kept two or three house- 
hold kids about me, -whom 1 taught to feed out of my hand ; 
and I had two more parrots, which talked pretty well, and 
irould all call Robin Crusoe, but ncne like my first ; ncnr

maeed, ciid 1 take the pains with any of tLem that I had 
done with him. I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose 
na:aos 1 knew not, that I caught upon the shore, and cut 
thc^ir wings ; and the little stakes which I had planted before 
my c-istle wall being now grown up to a good thick grov€, 
these fowls all lived among these low trees, and bred there, 
which was very agreeable to me : so that, as I said above, 1 
began to be very well contented with the life I led, if I 
could have been secured from the dread of the savages. But 
it was otherwise directed ; and it may not be amiss for all 
people who shall meet with my story, to make this just 
observation from it, viz.. How frequently, in the course oi 
our lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and 
which, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, 
IS oftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance, by 
which alone we can be raised again from the affliction we 
are fallen into. I could give many examples of this in the 
course of my unaccountable life, but in nothing was it more 
particularly remarkable than in the sircumstances of my last 
years of solitary residence in this island.

ll was now the month of December, as I said alcve, in my 
kwenty-third year; and this being the southern soltice (for 
winter I cannot call it), was the particular time of my har- 
vest, and required my being pretty mucl abroad in th» 
lelds; when going out pretty early in the morning, even 
Wfore it \ia«^ th rough daylight, I was surprised with seeing 



J12 ADVENTUKES OF 

ft light ot /nmc fire upon the shore, at a distance from m« 
of about ViVO miles, towards the end of the island where I 
had observed some savages had been, as before; and not on 
the other side, but, to my great affliction, it was on my side 
of the island. 

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped 
fthort within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be 
surprised ; and yet I had no more peace within, from the 
apprehensions I had that if these savages, in rambling over 
the island, should find my corn standing or cut, or any of 
my works and improvements, they would immediately con- 
clude that there were people in the place, and would then 
never give over till they had found me out. In this extrem- 
ity, I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder 
lifter me, and made all things without look as wild and 
natural us I could. 

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a pos- 
ture of defence : I loaded all my cannon, as I called them, 
that is to say, my muskets, which were mounted upon my 
new fortification, and all my pistols, and resolved to defend 
myself to the last gasp ; not forgetting seriously to com- 
mend myself to the divine protection, and earnestly to pray 
to God to deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians. I 
continued in this posture about two hours ; and began to be 
mighty impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies 
to send out. After sitting awhile longer, and musing what 
I shoidd do in this, 1 was not able to bear sitting in igno- 
rance any longer ; so setting up my ladder to the side of tbe 
hill, where there was a flat place, as I observed before, and 
then pidling the ladder up after me, I set it up again, and 
mounted to the top of the hill ; and putting out my per- 
spective glass, which I had taken on prjrpose, T aid me down 
flat on my belly on the ground, and began to look for the 
t>lace. I presently found there was no less than nine naked 
M^agef, sitting round a small fire they had made, not to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^jj 

warn them, for ihey had no need of that, the wedt:.er "^-ing 
extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to dre&s nome oi tleii 
oarbarous diet of human flesh, which they had brough ^vith 
them, whether alive or dead I could not tell. 

They had two canoes with them, which they Lad haui^e^i 
up upon the shore ; and as it was then the tidi& of ebb, thef 
Beemed to me to wait for the return of the flood to go aw»^ 
again. It is not easy to imagine what confusion this sigl 
put me into, especially seeing them*come on my side of th 
island, and so near me too ; but when I cunsidered thei 
coming must be always with the current of the ebb, I began 
afterwards, to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfiee 
that I might go abroad with safety all the time of the tidi 
of flood, if they were not on shore before ; and having mad* 
this observation, I went abroad about my harvest work with 
the more composure. 

As I expected, so it pioved ; for as soon as the tide made 
to the westward, 1 saw them all take boat, and row (oi 
paddle, as we call it) away. I should have observed, that 
for an hour or more before they wevit ofl*, they went 9 
dancing ; and I could easily discern their postures and 
gestures by my glass. I could not perceive, by my nicest 
observation, but that they were stark naked, and had not 
the least covering upon them ; but whether they were men 
«ir women, I could not distinguish. 

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two gum 
upon my shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my 
great sword by my side, without a scabbard, and with all 
the speed I was able to make, went away to the hill where I 
had discovered the first appearance of all ; and as soon a« 
I got thither which was not in less than two hours (for 1 
could not go apace, being sj loaden w^th arms as I wag), I 
perceived there had been three canoe? more cf savages al 
that place ; and looking out farther, I saw they were al) al 
tea togetl er, making over for the main. This was a dread* 



214 ADVENTURES CF 

ful sight to me, especially as, going down to the ^horft, I 
could sed the marks of horror, which the dismal work they 
aad been about had left behind it, viz., the blood, the bones, 
and part of the flesh, of human bodies, eaten and devoured 
by (.cose wretches with merriment and sport. I was so 
filled with indignation at the sight, that I now began to 
premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw there, .el 
them be whom or how many soever. It seemed evident to 
me that the visits which they made thus to this island were 
not very frequent, for it was above fifteen months before any 
more of them came on shore there again ; that is to say, I 
neither saw them, nor any footsteps or signals of them, ii 
all that time ; for, as to the rainy seasons, then they are 
sure not to come abroad, at least not so far : yet all this 
while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the constant 
apprehensions of their coming upon me by surprise : from 
whence I observe, that the expectation of evil is more bitter 
than the sufiering, especially if there is no room to shake oflf 
that expectation, or those apprehensions. 

During all this time I was in the murdering humor, and 
took up most of my hours, which should have been better 
employed, in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon 
them, the very next time I should see them ; especially il 
they should be divided, as they were the last time, into twa 
parties : nor did I consider at all, that if I killed one party, 
suppose ten or a dozen, I was still the next day, or week, or 
month, to kill another, and^so another, even ad infinitunu 
till I should be at length no less a murderer than they were 
in being man-eaters, and perhaps much more so. I spent 
my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of mina^ 
expecting that I should, one day or other fall mto the handa 
of these merciless creatures ; and if I did at any time ven- 
ture abroad, it was not without looking round me with the 
greatest care and caution imaginable. And now 1 found, tu 
my great comfort, how happy it was that I provided for 4 



ROBIN iON CRUSOE. 211 

tame flock or herd of goats: for I durst not, upon any 
acconut, fire my gim, especially near that side of the islanil, 
where they usually came, lest I should alarm the savages ; 
and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have them 
come again, with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with 
them, in a few days, and then I knew what to expect. 
However, I wore out a year and three months more before I 
ever saw any more of the savages, and then I found them 
again, as I shall soon observe. It is true, they might have 
been there once or twice, but either they made no stay, or at 
least I did not see them : but in the month of May, as near 
as I could calcidate, and in my four-and- twentieth year, I 
had 9 very strange encounter with them ; of which in its 
place. 

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or six- 
teen months' interval, was very great; I slept unquiet, 
dreamed always frightful dreams, and often started out of 
my sleep in the night : in the day, great troubles over- 
whelmed my mind ; and in the night, I dreamed often of 
killing the savages, and of the reasons why I might justify 
the doing of it. But to waive all this for a while. It wa» 
in the middle of May, on the sixteenth day, I think, as well 
xH my poor wooden calendar would reckon, for I marked all 
upon the post still ; I say, it was on the sixteenth of May 
that it Mew a very great storm of wind all day, with a great 
ieal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul night it was 
after it. I knew not what was the particular occasion of it, 
but as I was reading in the Bible, and taken up with very 
serious thoughts about my present condition, I was surprised 
With the noise of a gun, as I thought, fired at sea. This 
»vas, to be sure, a surprise quite of a different nature from 
any I had met with before ; for the notions this put into my 
thoughts were quite of another kind. I started up in the 
greatest haste imaginable, and, in a trice, clapped my la Idef 
o the middle place of the rock, and pulled it after me ; and

mounting it the second time, got to the top of the hill tbt 
very moment that a flash of fire bid me listen for a second 
gun, which ^accordingly, in about half a minute, I heard; 
and, by the sound, knew that it was from that part of the 
sea where I was driven down the current in my boat. I 
imiaediately considered that this must be some ship in dis 
(ress, and that they had some comrade, or some other shi| 
m company, and fired these guns for signals of distress, and 
to obtain help. I had the presence of mind, at that minute, 
to think that though 1 could not help them, it might be they 
might help me : so 1 brought together all the dry wood I 
could get at hand, and making a good handsome pile, 1 set 
it on fire upon the hill. The wood was dry, and Blazed 
freely ; and though the wind blew very hard, yet it burnt 
fairly out : so that I was certain, if there was any such thing 
as a ship, they must needs see it ; and no doubt they did ; 
for as soon as ever my fire blazed up I heard another gun, and 
after that several others, all from the same quarter. I plied 
my fire all night long, till daybreak ; and when it was broad 
day, and the air cleared up, I saw something at a great 
distance at sea, full east of the island, whether a sail or a 
bull I could not distinguish, no, not with my glass ; the 
distaiic ' was so great, and the weather still something hazy 
also , at least it was so out at sea. 

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived 
that it did not move ; so I pre^ ently concluded that it was a 
•hip at anchor; and being eager, you may be sure, to be 
satisfied, I took my gun in my hand, and ran towards the 
south side of the island, to the rocks where I had formerly- 
been carried away with the current ; and getting up there, 
the weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly 
gee, to my great sorrow, the wreck o^ a ship, cast away ir 
the night upon those concealed rocks which I found when I 
was out in my boat ; and which rocks, as they checked th< 
riclence of the stream, and made a kind of counter-stream

or eddy, were the cccasion of my recovering from the mos< 
desperate, hopeless condition that ever I had been in, in all 
my life. Thus, what is one man's safety is another man a 
destruction ; for it seems these men, whoever they were, 
being out of their knowledge, and the rocks being wholW 
Lnder water, had been driven upon them in the night, tht 
wind blowing hard at E.N.E. Had they seen the island, a>» 
I must necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as 1 
thought, have endeavored to have saved themselves on shore 
by the help of their boat ; but their firing off guns for help, 
especially when they saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me 
with many thoughts : First, I imagined that upon seeing my 
light, they might have put themselves into their boat, and 
endeavored to make the shore ; but that the sea going very 
nigh, they might have been cast away : other times I 
imagined that they might have lost their boat before, as 
might be the case many ways ; as particularly, by the 
breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many times 
obliged men to stave, or take in pieces, their boat, and 
sometimes to throw it overboard with their own hands : 
other times I imagined they had some other ship or ships in 
company, who, upon the signals of distress they had made, 
had taken them up and carried them off: other times 1 
fancied iKey were all gone off to sea in their boat, and being 
hurri»d . wa) by the current that I had been formerly in, 
were cumetl out into the p^cat ocean, where there was 
notl *ng but inisery and perishing; and that perhaps, they 
migh by this time be starving, and in a vendition to think 
of eat ng one »nother. 

As aJ \hvtie were but conjectui ?s at best, so, in the con- 
dition I was fn, I CO \d do no more than look on upon the 
miaery if the poor men, and pity them ; which had still this 
^ood effect on my side, that it gave me more and more cause 
to give thanks t ) Goa, who had so happily and comfortably 
rru«. idcd for m in my desolate conditior ; ind that of tw«

sLip's companies who were now cast awa^ upon this foit oi 
*he world, not one life should be spared bu mine. I learned 
here again to observe, that it is very rare that the providence 
of God casts us into any condition of life so low, or anj 
misery so great, but we may see something or othei to be 
thankful for, and may see others in worse circumstances than 
our own. Such certainly was the case of these men, of 
whom I could not so much as see room to suppose any 
of them were saved ; nothing could make it rational so 
much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish there, 
except the possibility only of their being taken up by 
another ship in company ; and this was but mere pos- 
sibility indeed, for I saw not the least sign or appearance 
of any such thing. 1 cannot explain, by any possible energy 
of words, what a strange longing or hankering of desirts I 
felt in my soul upon this sight, breaking out sometin es 
thus — O that there had been but one or t\vo, nay, or b

>y iU impetuosity, to such violent, eager embracings of the 
object, that the absence of it is insupportable. Such wer« 
ihese earnest wishings that but one man had been saved. I 
believe I repeated the words, " that it had been but one ! *' 
a thousand times ; and my desires were so moved by it, that 
when I spoke the words my hands would clinch together, 
and my fingers would press the palms of my hands so, that 
if I had had any soft thing in my hand it would have crushed 
it ir4 voluntarily ; and the teeth in my head would strike 
:r?gether, and set against one another so strong, that for 
some time I could not part them again. Let the naturalists 
explain these things, and the reason and manner of them : 
all r can say to them is, to describe the fact, which was even 
surprising to me, when I found it, though I knew not from 
whence it proceeded : it was doubtless the effect of ardep* 
wishes, and af strorig ideas formed in my mind, realising the 
comfort which the conversation of one of my fellow-Christians 
would have been to me. But it was not to be ; either their 
fiite or mine, or both, forbade it : for till the last year of my 
being on this island, I never knew whether any were saved 
out of that ship or no ; and had only the affliction, some 
days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on 
shore at the end of the island which was next the shin- 
^reck. He had no clothes on but a seaman's waistcoat, u 
pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt ; 
but nothing to direct me so much as to guess what nation 
he was of : he had nothing in his pockets but two pieces-ot- 
fiight and a tobacco-pipe : the last was to me of ten times 
more value than tfie first. 

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture o it 
in my boat to this wreck, not doubting I might find 

«?omething on board that might be useful w.^ me : but that 
lid not altogether press me so much, as the possibility that 
there might be yet some living creature on board whose lifo 
I might no* only save, b'l might, by savinj^ that life, conilcrl

my own ta the last degree. And this thought clung fc U 
my heart, that I could not be quiet night or day, but I m\igt 
venture out in my boat on board this wreck ; and commit 
ting the rest to Gjd's providence, I thought the impression 
was so strong upon my mind that it could not be resisted, 
that it must come from some invisible direction, and that J 
should be wanting to myself if I did not go. 

Under the power of t-iis impression, I nastened back to 
my castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took 9 
quantity of broad, a great pot of fresh water, a compass tj 
steer by, a bottxe of rum (for I had still a great deal of tha, 
left), ajid a basket of raisins ; and thus loading myself witu 
everything necessary, I went down to my boat, got the 
water out of her, put her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, 
and then went home again for more. My second cargo wat 
a great bag of rice, the umbrella to set up over^ my head fox 
a shade, another large pot of fresh water, and about two 
dozen of my small loaves, or barley-cakes, more than before, 
with a bottle of goat's milk and a cheese : all which, with 
<5:reat labor and sweat, I carried to my boat ; and praying to 
God to direct my voyage, I put out ; and rowing, or pad- 
dling, the canoe along the shore, came at last to the utmost 
point of the island on the north-east side. And now I was 
to launch out into the ocean, and either to venture or not to 
venture. I looked on the rapid currents which ran con- 
stantly on both sides of the island at a distance, and which 
were very terrible to me, from the remembrance of the 
tiazard I had been in before, and my heart began to fail me ; 
for I foresaw that if I was driven into either of those cur- 
rents, I should be carried a great way out to 8(*a^ and perhaps 
out of my reach, or sight of the island again ; and that, 
then, as my boat was bu' ^mall, if any little gale of wind 
should rise, I should be inevitably lost. 

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began tc 
gWe ovei my enterprise ; and having hauled my boat into a 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 22 1 

fittle creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat rae down 
upon a rising bit of ground, very pensive and anxious, 
between fear and desire, about my voyage : when, as I wa« 
musing, I could perceive that the tide was turned, and the 
flood come on ; upon which my going was impracticable foi 
BO many hours. Upon this, presently, it occurred to me that 
I should go up to the highest piece of ground I could find, 
and observe, if I could, how the sets of the tide, or currents, 
lay when the flood came in, that I might judge whether, if I was 
driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven another 
way home, with the same rapidness of the currents. This 
thought was no sooner in my head than I cast my eye upon 
a little hill, which sufficiently overlooked the sea both way8. 
Mid from whence I had a clear view of the currents, or seta 
•>f the tide, and which way I was to guide myself in my 
etum. Here I found, that as the current of the ebb set 
•mt close by the south point of the island, so the current of 
itood set in close by the shore of the nortlv side ; and that I 
had nothing to do but to keep to the north side of the island 
ID my return, and I should do well enough. 

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved, the next 
morning, to set out with the first of the tide ; and reposing 
myself for the night in my canoe, under the great watchcoat 
I mentioned, I launched out. I first made a little out to 
•ea, full north, till I began to feel the benefit of the current, 
which set eastward, and which carried me at a great rate, 
and yet did not so hurry me as the current on the south side 
had done before, so as to take from me all government ol 
the boat ; but having a strong steerage with my paddle, 1 
went at a great rate directly for the wreck, and in less than 
two hours I came up to it. It was a dismal sight to look 
at ; the ship, which, by its building, was Spanish, stuck fast, 
jammed in between two rocks ; all the stem and quarter oi 
her were beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her fore* 
eastle, whicli stuck in the rocks, had run on with great

122 ADVENTURES OF 

riolence, her mainmast and foremast were Irought by thi 
Doard, that is to say, broken short ofT; but her bowspril 
was sound, and the head and bow appeared firm. When 1 
came close to her, a dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me 
coming, yelped, and cried; and as soon as I called him, 
^amped into the sea to come to me. I took him into th€ 
boat, but found him almost dead with hunger and thirst. I 
gave him a cake of my bread, and he devoured it like a 
ravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in tht 
•now. I then gave the poor creature some fresh water, with 
which, if I would have let him, he would have burst him^ 
self. After this, I went on board ; but the first sight I met 
with was two men drowned in the cook room, or forecastle 
of the ship, with their arms fast about one another. I con- 
cluded, as is indeed probable, that when the ship struck, it 
being in a storm, the sea broke so high, and so continually 
over her, that the men "were not able to bear it, and were 
atr angled. with thOi constant rushing in of the water, as much 
AS if they had been under water. Besides the dog, there 
was nothing left in the ship that had life ; nor any goods, 
that I coxild see, but what were spoiled by the water. There 
were some casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy 1 knew 
not, which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water being 
ebbed out, I could see ; but they were too big to meddle 
with. I saw several chests, which I believed belonged to 
lome of the seamen ; and I got two of them into the boat, 
without examining what was in them. Had the stern of the 
ship been fixed, and the forepart broken off, I am persuaded 
I might have made a good voyage : for, by what I found m 
these two chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a great 
deal of wealth on board ; and, if I may guess from the 
eourse she steered, she must have been bound from Buenoa 
Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of Amenca, 
Deyond the Brazils, to the Havanna, in the Gulf of Mexico, 
And 80 perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a greal 



ROBINSON CRDbOE. 22S 

Areas are in her, but of no use, at that tunc, t i anybody ; 
and what became of her crew, I then knew not. 

I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, 
of about twenty gallons, which I got inio my boat with 
oiuch difficxilty. There were several muskets in the cabin, 
and a great powder-horn, with about four pounds of powder 
in it : ao for the muskets, I had no occasion for them, so 1 
left theiu, bat took the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel 
ind tongs, which I wanted extremely ; as also two little 

irass kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron : 
*nd with this cargo, ana the dog, I came away, the tide 
oeginning to make home again ; and the same evening, 
about an hour within night, I reached the island again, 
weary and fatigued to the last degree. I reposed that night 
in the boat ; and in the morning I resolved to harbor what 1 
had got in my new cave, and not carry it home to my castle. 
Atter reireshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and 
began to examine the particulars. The cask of liquor I 
fouud to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the 
Brazds, and, in a word, not at all good ; but when I came 
to open the chests, I found several things of great use to 
me : for example, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of an 
extraorcunaiy kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine and 
^ery good ; lue mottles held about three pints each, and 
were tipped with silver. I found two pots of very good 
succades or sweetmeatb, so fastened also on the top, that the 
«alt water had not hurt ihem ; and two more of the same 
which the wa^^er nad spoiled. I found some very good 
shirts, which were very welcome to me ; and about a dozen 
end a half of white linen handkerchiefs and colored neck- 
cloths ; the former were also very welcome, being exceeding 
f»^freshing to wipe my face in a hot day. Besides this, when 
} came to the till in 4ke chest, 1 found there three great bags 
#f pieces-of-eight, which held about eleven hundred piecea 

A all ; and in one of them, w rapped up in a paper, sii

I suppose they might all weigh near a pound. In the othe 
chests were some clothes, but of little value ; but, by thw 
circumstances, it must have belonged to the gunner s mate ; 
though there was no powSer in it, except two pcainds of fiii« 
glazed powder, in three small flasks, kept, I suppose, f»ii 
charging their fowling-pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, 
I got very little by this voyage that was of any use to me • 
for, as to the money, I had no manner of occasion for it ; it 
was to me as the dirt under my feet ; and I would have 
given it all for three or four pair of English shoes and stock- 
ings, which were things I greatly wanted, but had none on 
my feet for many years. I had indeed got two pair of shoes 
now, which I took off the feet of the two drowned men 
whom I saw in the wreck, and I found two pair more in one 
of the chests, which were very welcome to me ; bi.t they 
were not like our English shoes, either for ease or service, 
eing rather what we call pumps than shoes. I /)und in 
nis seaman's chest about fifty pieces-of-eight in rial , but no 
gold; I suppose this belonged to a poorer man vha^ the 
other, which seemed to belong to some officer. Well, how- 
ever, I lugged this money home to my cave, and laid it up, 
as I had done that before which I brought from our own 
ship : but it was a great pity, as 1 said, that the other part 
of this ship had not come to my share ; for I am satisfied 1 
might have loaded my canoe several times over with money ; 
and, thought I, if I ever escape to England, it might lie 
kiere safe enough till I may come again and fetch it. 

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured 
ilkem, I went back to my boat, and rowed or padciled her 
iilong the shore, to her old harbor, where I laid her up, and 
made the best of my way to my old habitation, where 1 found 
everything safe and quiet. I began n&w to repose myself, 
live after my old fashion, and take care of my family affairs ; 
tnd, for a while, I lived easy enough, only that I waf moti

figilant thao 1 used to be, looked out oftener, and did nc go 
abroad so much ; and if at any time I did stir with any free- 
dom, it was always to the east part of the island, where 1 
was pretty well satisfied the savages never^ came, and where 
I could go without so many precautions, and such a load oi 
arms and ammunition as I always carried with me if I wen I 
the other way. I lived in this condition near two years more ; 
but my unlucky head, that was always to let me know it was 
bom to make my body miserable, was all these two years filled 
with projects and designs, how, if it were possible, I might 
get away firom this island : for sometimes I was for making 
another voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me that 
there was nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage ; 
sometimes for a ramble one way, sometimes another ; and 1 
believe verily, if I had had the boat that I went from Sallee 
in, I should have ventured to sea, bound anywhere, I knew 
not whither. I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento 
to those who are touched with the general plague of man- 
kind, whence, for aught I know, one-half of their miseries 
flow ; I mean that of not being satisfied with the station 
wherein God and nature hath placed them : for, not to look 
back upon my primitive condition, and the excellent advice oi 
my father, the opposition to which was, as I may call it, my 
original sin, my subsequent mistakes of the same kind had 
been the means of my coming into this miserable condition ; 
for had that Providence, which had so happily seated me at 
the Brazils as a planter, blessed me with confined desires, 
f nd I could have been contented to have gone on gradually, 
I might have been, by this time, I mean in the time of my 
b'iing in this island, one of the most considerable planters in 
ti -\ Brizils ; nay, I am persuaded, that by the improvementa 
^. I ad made in that little time I lived there, and the increase 
i shoidd probably have made if I remained, I might have

them at our own ^oor from those whose business it was to 
fetch them ; and though it had cost us something more, yet 
the difference of that price was by no means worth saving at 
so great a hazard ? But as this is usually the fate of youDg 
heads, so reflection upon the foLy of it is as commonly Le 
exc«rcise of more years, or of the dear-bought experience ol 
time : so it was with me now ; and yet so deep had the 
mistake taken root in my temper, that I could not satisfy 
myself in my station, but was continually poring upon the 
means and possibility of my escape from this place. And 
that I may with the greater pleasure of the reader, bring on 
the remaining part of my story, it may not be improper to 
give some account of my first conceptions on the subject o' 
this foolish scheme for my escape, and how, and upon what 
foundation, I acted. 

I am now to be supposed retired into my castle, after my 
late voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up and secured 
under v/ater, as usual, and my condition restored to what it 
was before ; I had more wealth, indeed, than I had before, 
but was not at all the richer : for I had no more use for it 
than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came th^re. 

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the 
four-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island 
of solitude, I was lying in my bed, or hammock, awake ; 
very well in health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneas'nesa 
of body, nor any imeasiness of mind, more than ordinary , 
but could by no means close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep ;

{ may call it, to m} coming to this island, and also of that 
part of my life sinoi 1 came to this island. In my reflec- 
aons upon the state of my case since I came on shore on 
bhis island, I was comparing the happy posture of my afFairp 
m the first years of my habitation here, compared to the life 
of anxiety, fezir, and care which 1 had lived in, ever sin^e 1 
had seen the print of a foot in the sand : not that I did not 
believe the savages had frequented the island even all the 
while, and might have been several hundreds of them a* 
times on shore there ; but I had never known it, and waf 
incapable of any apprehensious about it ; my satisfaction 
was perfect, though my danger was the same, and I was as 
happy in not knowing my danger, as if I had never really 
Deen exposed to it. This furnished my tiioughts with many 
very profitable reflections, and particularly this one : How 
infinitely good that Providence is, which has provided, in its 
government of mankind, such narrow bounds to his sight 
and knowledge of things ; and though he walks in the 
midst of so many thousand dangers, the sight of which, if 
iiscovcred to him, would distract his mind and sink his 
ipirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having the events of 
things hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers 
M'hich surround him. 

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, 1 
eame to reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in 
for so many years in this very island, and how I had walked 
about in the greatest security, and with all possible tranquil- 
ity, even when perhaps nothing but the brow of a hill, a 
great tree, or the casual approach of night, had been betwecD 
me and the worst kind of destruction, viz., that of falling 
into the hands of cannibals and savages, who would have 
«eized on me with the same view as I would on a goat oi 
a turtle, and have thought it no more a crime to kill and 
devour me, than I did a pigeon or a curlew. I ^^ ould un- 
ustly slander myself, if I should say I was lot sincerelj

Uiankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular piotectioB 
I acknowledged, with great humility, all these unknown 
deliverances were due, and without which 1 must inevitably 
have fallen into their merciless hands. 

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some 
time taken up in considering the nature of thebe wTetched 
creatures, I mean the savages, and how it came to pasb in 
the world, that the wise Governor of all things should give 
up any of his creatures to such inhumanity, nay, to some- 
thing 80 much below even brutality itself, as to devour its 
own kind ; but as this ended in some (at that time) fruitless 
•peculations, it occurred to me to inquire what part of the 
world these wretches lived in ? how fur oflf the coast was from 
whence they came ? what they ventured over so far from home 
for ? what kind of boats they had ? and why I might not 
order myself and my business so, that I might be as able to 
go over thither as they were to come to me. 

I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I 
should do with myself when 1 went thither, what would 
become of me, if I fell into the hands of the savages ; or 
how I should escape from them, if they attacked me : no, 
nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach the 
coast, and not be attacked by some or other of them, with- 
out any possibility of delivering myself ; and if I should not 
fall into their hands, what I should do for provision, oi 
whither I should bend my course : none of these thoughts, 1 
say, so much as came in my way ; but my mind was wholly 
bent upon the notion of my passing over in my boat to the 
mitin land. 1 looked upon my present condition as the most 
miserable that co\ild possibly be ; that I was not able to 
throw myself into anything, but death, that could be called 
worse ; and if I reached the shore of the main, 1 might 
perhaps meet with relief, or I might coast along, as I did on 
the African sho "e, till I came to some inhabited country, and

which would put an end to all these miseries at once. Pray 
note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient 
temper, made desperate, as it were, by the long continuance oi 
my troubles, and the disappointments I had met in the wreck 
I had been on board of, and where I had been so near ob- 
taining what I so earnestly longed lor, viz., somebody to 
speak to, and to learn some knowledge from them of the 
AjLCe where I was, and of the probable means of my 
dt:liverance. I was agitated wholly by these thoughts : all 
ny calm of mind, in my resignation to Providence, and 
waiting the issue in the dispositions of Heaven, seemed to 
be suspended ; and I had as it were, no power to turn my 
thoughts to anything but to the project of a voyage to the 
main, which came upon me vdth such force, and such a« 
impetuosity of desire, that it was not to be resisted. 

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or 
more, with such violence that it set my very blood into a 
ferment, and my pulse beat as if I had been in a fever, 
merely with the extraordinary fervor of my mind about it, 
nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the 
very thought of it, threw me into a sound sleep. One 
would have thought I should have dreamed of it, but I did 
not, nor of anything relating to it : but I dreamed that as 1 
was going out in the morning, as usual, from my castle, I 
•aw upon the shore two canoes and eleven ^•vages coming to 
land, and that they brought with them another savage, whom 
they were going to kill, in order to eat him ; when, on a 
sudden, the savage that they were going to kill jumped 
awaj , and ran for his life ; and I thought, in my sleep, thai 
he came running into my little thick grove before my fortifi- 
cation, to hide himself; and that I, seeing him alone, and 
ftnd no' perceiving that the others sought him that way, 
•Lowed myself to him, and smiling upon him, encouraged

niin: Lat he kneeled down to me, seenung to pray mo U 
assist him : upon which I showed him my ladder, made h*nr 
go up. and carried him into my cave, and he became my 
servant : and that as soon as 1 had got this man, I said to 
myself. Now I may certainly venture to the main land ; fox 
this fellow will serve me as a pilot, and will tell me what to 
do, and whither to go for provisions, and whither not to go 
for fear of being devoured ; what places to venture into, and 
what to shun. I waked with this thought ; and was undet 
luch inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of my 
escape in my dream, that the disappointments which I felt 
upon coming to myself, and finding that it was no more 
than a dream, were equally extravagant the other way, and 
threw me into a very great dejection of spirits. 

Upon this, however, I made this tjonplusion : that my 
only way to go about to attempt an escape was, if possible, 
o get a savage into my possession ; and, if possible, it 
hould be one of their prisoners whom they had condemned 
*o be eaten, and should bring hither to kill. But thnse 
thoughts still were attended with this difficulty, that it was 
impossible to effect this without attacking a whole caravan 
of them, and killing them all : and this was not only a very 
desperate attempt, and might miscarry : but, on the othei 
hand, I had greatly scrupled the lawfulness of it to myself, 
and my heart trembled at the thought of shedding so much 
blood, though it was for my deliverance. I need not repeat 
the arguments which occurred to me against this, they being 
the same mentioned before : but though I had other reason! 
to offer now, viz., that those men were enemies to my life, 
md would devour me if they could; that it was self- 
preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself from 
this death of a life, and was acting in my own defence as 
mach as if they were actually assaulting me, and the like; 
I say, though these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of 
•bedding huir.Mi blood fo my deliveranco were very te^bU

k9 nie, and such as 1 could by no means reconcile my&ilf tc 

•or d gre&.t while. However, at last, after many secret 
disputes with myself, and after great perplexities about i* 
(for all these arguments, one way and another, struggled 
in M.^ head \ long time), the eager prevailing desire o. 
deliverance at length mastered all the rest ; and I resolved 
if possible, to get one of those savages into my hands, cost 
what it would. My next thing was to contrive how to do 
it, and this indeed was very difficult to resolve on : but as I 
could pitch u| on no probable means for it, so I resolved to 
put myself upon the watch, to see them when they 
came on shore, and leave the rest to the event, taking such 
measures as the opportunity should present, let what would 
be. 

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon 
the scout as often as possible, and indeed so often, that I 
was heartily tired of it ; for it was above a year and a hall 
that I waited ; and for great part of that time went out to 
the west end, and to the south-west comer of the island, 
almost every day, to look for canoes, but none appeared. 
This was very discouraging, and began to trouble me much, 
though I cannot say that it did in this case (as it had done 
pome time before) wear oflf the edge of my desire to the 
thing ; but the longer it seemed to be delayed, the more 
eager I was for it : in a word, I was not at first so careful to 
shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being seen by 
them, as I was now eager to be upon them. Besides, 1 
fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two or three 
ravages, if I had them, so as to make them entirely slaves to 
me, to do whatever I should direct them, and to prevent 
th'^ir being able at any time to do me any hurt. It was a 
great while that I pleased myself with this affair ; but no- 
thing still presented ; all my fancies and schemes came tc 
BOtmng, for no savages came near me for a great while.

WHOM HE NAMES FRIDAY, AND MAKES HIS 8BBTANT. 

.^BOUT a year and a half after I entertained these notiom 
(and by long musing had, as it were, resolved them all into 
nothing for want of an occasion to put them into execution), 
I was surprised, one morning early, with seeing no less than 
five canoes all on shore together on my side the island, and 
the people who belonged to them all landed, and out of my 
sight. The number of them broke all my measures ; for see- 
ing so many, and knowing that they always came four or six, 
or sometimes more, in a boat, I could not tell what to think 
of it, or how to take my measures, to attack twenty or thirty 
men single-handed ; so lay still in my castle, perplexed and 
discomforted : however, I put myself into all the same pos- 
tures for an attack that i had formerly provided, and was 
just ready for action, if anything had presented. Having 
waited a good while, listening to hear if they made any 
noise, at length, being very impatient, 1 set my guns at the 
foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of the hili, 
by my two stages, as usual ; standing so, however, that my 
head did not appear above the hill, so that they could not 
perceive me by any means. Here I observed, by the heip 
of my perspective glass, that they were no less than thirty 
in number ; that they had a fire kindled, and that they lad 
meat dressed. How they had cooked it I knew not, or wnat 
it was ; but tney were all dancing, in I know not how many 
barbarous gestures and figures, their own way, rouna tne 
5re 

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by mj 
perspective, two miserable wretches dragged from the ooats

fhcre, Jt seems, they were laid by, and were now broughj 
nt for the slaughter. 1 perceived one of them immediately 
fdl, being knocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden 
iword, for that was their way, and two or three others were 
tt work immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, 
while the other victim was left standing by himself, till they 
should be ready for him. In that very moment, this poor 
wretch seeing himself a little at liberty, and unbound, nature 
inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away from 
them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands, 
directly towards me, I mean towards that part of the coast 
where my habitation was. I was dreadfully frightened, I 
must acknowledge, when I perceived him run my way, and 
especially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by the 
whole body: and now I expected that part of my dream 
was coming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter 
in my grove ; but I could not depend, by any means, upon 
my dream for the rest of it, viz., that the other savages 
would not pursue him thither, and find him there. How- 
ever, I kept my stajtion, and my spirits began to recover, 
when I found that there was not above three men that fol- 
lowed him ; and still more was I encouraged when I found 
that he outstripped them exceedingly in running, and gained 
ground of them, so that if he could but hold it for half an 
hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away from them all. 

There was between them and my castle the creek, which 
I mentioned often in the first part of my story, where I 
.anded my cargoes out of the ship ; and this I saw plainly 
le must necessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be 
aken theie : but when the savage escaping came thither, he 
naoe nothing of it, though the tide was then up ; but 
jiun^fing in, swam through in about thirty strokes, or ihere- 
<kbou*», landed, and ran on with exceeding strength and 
•wxitness. When the three persons came to the crc ek, 1

\nd that, standing on the other side, he looked at ine others 
but went no farther, and soon after went softly back agair • 
which, as it happened, was very well for him in the end. 1 
observed, that the two who swam were yet more than twic€ 
as long swimming over the creek as the fellow was that fled 
from them. It came now very warmly upon my thoughts, 
and indeed irresistibly, that now was the time to get me a 
servant, and perhaps a companion or assistant, and that I 
was called plainly by Providence to save this poor creature' f 
life. I immediately ran down the ladders with all possibU 
expedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both at the 
foot of the ladders, as 1 observed above, and getting up 
igain, with the same haste, to the top of the hill, 1 crossed 
toward the sea, and having a very sh6rt cut, and all down- 
hill, placed myself in the way between the pursuers and the 
pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who, looking back, 
was at first, perhaps, as much frightened at me as at them ; 
"Out I beckoned with my hand to him to come back ; and, in 
vhe meantime, I slowly advanced towards the two that fol- 
lowed : then rushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked 
him down with the stock of my piece. I was loth to fire, 
because I would not have the rest hear ; though, at that 
distance, it would not have been easily heard, and being out 
of sight of the smoke too, they would not have easily known 
what to make of it. Having knocked this fellow down, the 
other who pursued him stopped, as if he had been frightened, 
and I advanced apace towards him : but as I came nearer, I 
perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting 
it to shoot at me ; so I was then necessitated to shoot at 
Lim first, which I did, and killed him at the fiist shot Th£ 
D5or savage who fled but had stopped, though he saw both 
6is enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was sc 
frightened with the fire and noise of my piece, that he stood 
itock still, and neither came forward nor went backwaru. 
though h^ se - med rather inclined still to fly than to comf

n. I hallooed again to him, and made signs to ccme for 
rard, which he easily understood, and came a little way ; 
»hen stopped again, and then a little farther, and stopped 
Again ; and I could then perceive that he stood trembling, 
s if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to \% 
Killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned to him again 
to come to me, and gave him all the signs of encouragement 
that I could think of; and he came nearer and nearer, kneel- 
ing down every ten or twelve steps, in token of acknowledg- 
ment for saving his life. 1 smiled at him, and looked 
pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer : at 
length he came close to me ; and then he kneeled down 
again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon the ground, 
and taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head : this, 
it seems, was in token of swearing to be my slave for ever. 
I took him up, and made much of him, and encouraged him 
all I could. But there was more work to do yet ; for I per- 
ceived the savage whom I knocked down was not killed but 
stunned with the blow, and began to come to himself; so I 
pointed to him, and showed him the savage, that he was not 
dead : upon this he spoke some words to me, and though I 
could not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant 
to hear ; for they were the first sound of a man's voice that 
[ had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty-five years. 
But there was no time for such reflections now ; the savage 
who was knocked down recovered himself so far as to sit uf 
apon the ground, and I perceived that my savage began *o 
be afraid ; but when 1 saw that, I presented my other piece 
at the man, as if I would shoot him ; upon this my savago, 
for so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my 
■word which hung naked in a belt by my side, which I di I. 
He no sooner had it, but he runs to his enemy, and, at one 
blow, cut off his head so cleverly, no executioner in Ger- 
many could have done it sooner or better ; which I though^ 
o^sry strange for one wio, I had reason to believe, never mm

a sword in bis life before, except tbeir own wooden swords . 
however, it seems, as I learned afterwards, they make tbeii 
wooden swords so sharp, so beavy, and tbe wood is so hard, 
that they will cut off heads even with them, aye and ann&, 
sud that at one blow too. When he had done this, he comei 
laughing to me, in sign of triumph, and brought me the 
sword agiun, and with abundance of gestures, which I did 
not understand, laid it down, with the head of the ravage 
that he had killed, just before me. But that which aston- 
bhed him most was to know how I killed^ the other Indian 
80 &r off : so pointing to him, he made signs to me to let him 
go to him ; so I bade him go, as well as I could. When he 
eame to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at him, turn- 
ing him first on one side, then on the other, looked at the 
wound the bullet had made, which it seems, was just in his 
breast where it had made a hole, and no great quantity oi 
blood had followed, but he bad bled inwardly, for he was quite 
dead. He took up his bow and arrows, and came back ; so I 
turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow me, making 
signs to him that more might come after them Upon this, be 
made signs to me that he should bury them with sand, that 
they might not be seen by the rest, if they followed ; and so 
I made signs to him again to do so. He fell to work ; and, in 
an instant, he had scraped a hole in the sjmd with hi? hands, 
big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him into it, 
and covered him ; and did so by the other also ; I believe ha 
had buried them both in a quarter of an hour. Then callin^^ 
him away, I carried him, not to my castle, but quite away, to 
my cave, on the farther part of the island ; so I did not let ny 
dnam come to pass in that part, viz , that he came into my 
grove for shelter. Here T gave him bread and a bunch of 
raisin") to eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was in 
ieed in great distress for, by his running ; and having refreshea

llin ti place where I had laid some rice straw, and a blankei 
apou it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes ; s^ 
the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep. 

He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, 
with straight, strong limbs, not too large, tall, and well- 
ihaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age. 
He had a very good countenance, not a fierce and surly 
aspect ; but seeemed to have something very manly in his 
face ; and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of an 
European in his countenance too, especially when he smiled. 
His hair was long and black, not curled like wool ; his fore- 
head very high and large ; and a great vivacity and sparkling 
sharpness in his eyes. The color of his skin was not quite 
black, but very tawny ; and yet not an ugly, yellow, nause- 
ous tuwny, as the Brazilians and Virginians, and othei 
natives of America are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive- 
color, that had in it something very agreeable, though not 
very easy to describe. His face was round and plump ; hit 
nose small, not flat like the Negroes ; a very good mouth, 
thin lips, and his fine teeth well set, and as white as ivory. 

After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an 
hour he awoke again, and came out of the cave to me, for I 
had been milking my goats, which I had in the enclosure 
just by ; when he espied me, he came running to me, lajing 
himself down again upon the ground, with all the possible 
signs of an humble, thankful disposition, making a great 
many antic gestures to show it. At last, he lajs his head 
flat upon the ground, close to my foot, and sets my foot upon 
ais head, as he had done before ; and after this made all the 
sig:i8 to me of subjection, servitude, and submission imagi- 
nable, to let me know he would serve me as long as he lived. 
I inderstood him in many things, and let him know I wa^ 
ler}- well pleased with him. In a little time I began to 
^X>eak to him and teach him to speak to me ; and, first, I let

'or the present, tolerably well, and was mighty well pleaded 
to see himself almost as well clothed as his master. It ii 
true, he went awkwardly in those clothes at first ; wearing 
the drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves ol 
the waistcoat galled his shoulders, and the inside of hi» 
arms : but after a little easing them where he complained 
Ihoy hurt him, and using himself to them, he took to them 
at length very well. 

The next day after I came home to my hutch with him, I 
began to consider where I should lodge him ; and that 1 
mi^ht do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, 
made a little tent for him in the vacant place between my 
^\^o fortifications, in the insid? of the last and in the outside 
of the first. As there was a door or entrance there into my 
cave, I made a formal framed doorcase, and a door to it of 
boards, and set it up in the passage, a little within the 
entrance ; and causing the door to open in the inside, I 
barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders too ; so thai 
Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my inner- 
most wall, without making so much noise in getting ovei 
that it must needs waken me : for my first wall had now 8 
complete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, 
and leaning up to the side of the hill ; which was again 
laid across with smaller sticks, instead of laths, and then 
thatched over a great thickness with the rice-straw, which 
was strong, like reeds : and at the hole or place which was 
left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind oi 
trap door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside, 
would not have opened at all, but would have fallen down, 
and made a great noise : as to weapons, I took them all 
into my side every night. But 1 needed none of all this 
precaution ; for never man had a more faithful, loving, sin- 
rere servant than Friday was to me ; without passions, 
lullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and engaged — hii 
^ery affections were tied to me, like those of a child to *

father ; and I dare say, he would have sacrificed his life for the 
saving mine upon any occasion whatsoever : the many testi- 
monies he gave me of this put it out of doubt, and soon 
convinced me that I needed to use no precautions, as to my 
safety on his account. 

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that 
with wonder, that however it had pleased God, in his provi- 
dence, and in the government of the works of his hands, to 
take from so great a part of the world of his creatures the 
best uses to which their faculties and the powers of theit 
souls are adapted, yet that he has bestowed upon them the 
same powevs, the same reason, the same affections, the same 
sentiments of kindness and obligation, the same passions 
and resentments of wrongs, the same sense of gratitude, 
sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities of doing good, and 
receiving good, that he has given to us ; and that when he 
pleases to offer them occasions of exerting these, they are as 
ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the right uses for 
which they were bestowed, than we are. This made me 
very melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as the several 
occasions presented, how mean a use we make of all these, 
even though we have these powers enlightened by the great 
lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge 
or his word added to our understanding ; and why it has 
pleased God to hide the like saving knowledge from so many 
millions of souls, who, if I might judge by this poor savage^ 
would make a much better use of it than we did. From 
hence, I sometimes was led too far, to invade the sovereignty 
of Providence, and as it were arraign the justice of so 
arbitrary a disposition of things, that should hide that light 
from some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like 
duty from both ; but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts 
with this conclusion ; first. That we did not know by what 
light and law these should be condemned : but that as God 
wag necessarily, and, by the nature of his being, infinitely 
21

noly and just, so it could not be, but if these creatures wen 
all sentenced to absence from himself, it was on account oi 
sinning against that light, which, as the Scripture says, was 
a law to themselves, and by such rules as their consciences 
would acknowledge to be just, though the foundation wai 
not discovered to us ; and, secondly. That still, as we all are 
the clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel could say to 
Him, Why hast thou formed me thus ? 

But to return to my new companion: — I was greatly 
delighted with him, and made it my business to teach him 
everything that was- proper to make him useful, handy, and 
helpful ; but especially to make him speak, and understand 
me when I spoke ; and he was the aptest scholar that ever 
was ; and particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, 
and so pleased when he could but understand me, or make 
me understand him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk 
to him. Now my life began to be so easy, that I began to 
say to myself, that could I but have been safe from more 
savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from the place 
where I lived.

I thought that, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid 
■^ay of feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's stomach, 1 
jught to let him taste other flesh ; so I took him out with 
me one morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to 
cill a kid out of my own flock, and bring it home and dres« 
t« but as I was going, I saw a she-goat lying down in t>«

ibade, and two young kids sitting by her. I catcKed hold 
of Friday ; — Hold, said I ; stand still ; and made signs to 
nira not to stir : immediately I presented my piece, shot, and 
killed one of the kids. The poor creature, who had, at a 
di?tance, indeed, seen me kill the savage, bis enemy, but did 
not know, nor could imagine, how it was done, was sensibly 
surprised, trembled and shook, and looked so amazed, that I 
thought he would have sunk down. He did not see the fed 
I shot at, or perceive I had killed it, but ripped up hia 
waistcoat to feel whether he was not wounded, and, as I 
found presently, thought I was resolved to kill him : for he 
came and kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees, 
said a great many things I did not understand ; but I could 
easily see the meaning was, to pray me not to kill him. 

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him 
no harm ; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, 
and pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned to him 
to run and fetch it, which he did ; and while he was wonder- 
ing, and looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded 
my gun again. By and by, I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, 
sitting upon a tree, within shot ; so, to let Friday under 
stand a little what I would do, 1 called him to me again, 
pointed at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though I 
thought it had been a hawk ; I say, pointing to the parrot, 
and to my gun, and to the ground under the parrot, to let 
him see I would make it fall, I made him understand that I 
would shoot and kill that bird : accordingly, I fired, and 
hade him look, and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He 
:tood like one frightened again, notwithstanding all 1 had 
said tc him ;* and I found he was the more amazed, because* 
he did not see me put anything into the gun, but thought 
that there must be some wonderful fund of death and de- 
ftruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, or bird, oi 
anything near or for off; and the astonishment this created 
In hira was such, as could not wear off for a long time ; ani 



144 ADVENTUKIS.S OF 

I belieyc, if I would have let him nc woui 1 have worbtiippej 
me and my gun. . As for the guu itseu', he would not so 
much as touch it for several days after; but he would 
ipeak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when 
he was by himself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, 
was to desire it not to kill him. Well, after his astonish- 
ment was a little over at this, I pointed to him to run and 
fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but stayed some 
time ; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered 
away a good distance from the place where she fell : however, 
he foimd her, took her up, and brought her to me ; and as I 
had perceived his ignorance about the gun before, I took this 
advantage to charge the gun again, and not to let him see 
me do it, that I might be ready for any other mark that 
might present ; but nothing more offered at that time ; so I 
brought home the kid, and the same evening I took the skin 
off, and cut it out as well as I could ; and having a pot fit 
for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and 
made some very good broth. After I had begun to eat 
some, I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, 
and iTked it very well ; but that which was strangest to him, 
was to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that 
the salt was not good to eat ; and putting a little into his 
mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter 
at it, washing his mouth with fresh water after it ; on the 
other hand, I took some meat into my mouth without salt, 
and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast 
as he had done at the salt ; but it would not do ; he would 
never care for salt with his meat or in his broth ; at least, 
not for a great while, and then but very little. 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was 
resolved to feast him the next day with roasting a piece oi 
the kid : this I did, by hanging it before the fire on a string, 
%s I had seen many people do in England, setting two poles 
tp, one on cad side of the fire, and one across on the top^

»ud tjring the string to the cross-stick, letting the meat turn 
eontinually. This, Friday admired very much : but whei 
be came to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell m« 
how well he liked it, that Z could not but understand him ; 
and at last he told me, as well as he could, he would nevei 
«at man's flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear. 

The next day I set him to work to beating some com out, 
and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I observeJ 
before ; and he soon understood how to do it as well as I, 
especially after he had seen what the meaning of it was, and 
that it was to make bread of it : for after that I let him see 
me make my bread, and bake it too ; and in a little time 
Friday was able to do all the work for me, as well as I 
could do it myself. 

I began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed 
instead of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, 
and plant a larger quantity of corn than I used to do : so I 
marked out a larger piece of land, and began the fence in 
the same manner as before, in which Friday worked not only 
very willingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully : and 
I told him what it was for ; that it was for com to make 
more bread, because he was now with me, and that I might 
have enough for him and myself too. He appeared very 
sensible of that part, and let me know that he thought I had 
much more labor upon me on his account than I had for 
myself; and that he would work the harder for me, if I 
would tell him what to do. 

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this 
place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand 
the names of ahnost everything I had occasion to call for, 
and of every place I had to send him to, and talked a great 
deal to me ; so that, in short, I now began to have some use 
for my tongue again, which, indeed, I had very little occasion 
for before, that is to say, about speech. Besides the pleasure 
»f talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the felion

Himself: his simple, unfeigned honesty appeared to me mow 
nd more every day, and I began really to lo\e the creature; 
and, on his side, I believe he loved me more than it was pes* 
sible for him ever to love anything before. 

I had a mind on.e to try if he had any hankering inclina- 
tion to his own country again ; and havmg taught him 
English 80 well that he could answer me almost any 
question, I asked him whether the nation that he belonged 
to, never conquered in battle r At which he smiled, and 
said. Yes, yes, we always fight the better : that is, ne meant 
always get the better in fight ; and so we began the follow- 
ing discourse : — 

Masteb. You always fight the better ? how came you to 
be taken prisoner then, Friday ? 

Fki I)A.t. My nation beat much, for all that. 

Masteb. How beat? If your nation beat them, how 
came you to be taken ? 

Fbidat. They more many than my nation in the place 
where me was ; they take one, two, three, and me ; my 
nation overheat them in the yonder place, where me no was ; 
there my nation take one, two, great thousand. 

Masteb. But why did not your side recover you from the 
hands of your enemies, then ? 

Fbiday. They run one, two, three, and me, and make go 
In the canoe ; my nation have no canoe that time. 

Masteb. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do 
with the men they take ?' Do they carry them away and 
eat them, as these did ? 

Fbidat. Yes, my nation eat mans too ; eat all up. 

Masteb. Where do they carry them? 

Fbiday. Go to other place, where they think. 

Masteb. Do they come hither ? 

Fbiday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come jther elsi

Masteb. Have you been here with them } 



ROBINSON CRUSOto 24, 

Friday. I'es, I have been here ; (points to the n.w. side 
>f the island, which, it seems, was their side.) 

By this I understood that my man Friday had formerlj 
been among the savages who used to come on shore on the 
farther part of the island, on the same man-eating occasions 
he was now brought for : and some time after, when 1 took 
the courage to carry him to that side, being the same 1 for- 
merly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told me 
he was there once when they eat up twenty men, two women, 
and one child : he could not tell twenty in English, but he 
numbered them, by laying so many stones in a row, and 
pointing to me to tell them over. 

1 have told this passage, because it introduces what fol- 
lows ; that after I had this discourse with him, I asked him 
how lar it was from our island to the shore, and whether the 
Ci*noes were not often lost. He told me there was no 
danger, no canoes ever lost ; but that, after a little way out 
to sea, mere was a current and wind, always one way in the 
mommg, tne otner in the afternoon. This I understood to 
be no more than the sets of the tide, as going out or coming 
in ; but I afterwards understcod it was occasioned by the 
great draft and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the 
mouth or gulf of which river, as I found afterwards, our 
island lay ; and that this land which I perceived to the W. 
and N.W. was the great island of Trinidad, on the north 
point of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday a thousand 
questions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the 
coast, and what nations were near : he told me all he knew, 
with the greatest openness imaginable. I asked him tlie 
names of the several nations of his sort of people, but could 
get no other name than Caribs : from whence I easily under- 
itood, that these were the Caribbees, which our maps place 
on * le part of America which reaches from the mouth of th^ 
Uvf> Oroonoko to Guiana, and onwarda to St. Martha. H« 
f^ ' jne that up a great way beyon^. tho moon, tliat waa*

beyond the setting of the moon, which must be \ii8t fron 
theii country, there dwelt white bearded men, like me, and 
pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned before ; 
and that they had killed much mans, that was his word ; by 
all which I understood, he meant the Spaniards, whosa 
cru'ilties in America had been spread over the whole country 
and were remembered by all the nations, from father to 
son. 

I inquired if he could tell me Low I might go from this 
island and get among those white men : he told me. Yes, 
yes, you may go in two canoe. I could not understand what 
he meant, or make him describe to me what he meant by 
two canoe ; till, at last, with great difficulty, I found he 
meant it must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes. 
This part of Friday*s discourse began to relish with me verv 
well ; and from this time I entertained some hopes that, one 
time or other, I might find an opportunity to make mv escape 
from this place, and that this poor c^vage might be a means 
to help me. *^

A.FTEB Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and 
Uiat he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak 
pietty fluently, though in broken English, to me, I acquainted 
him with my own history, or at least so much of it as re- 
Uted to my coming to this place ; how I had lived here, and 
low long : I let him into the mystery, for such it was t« 
lim, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot 



AOBINSON CRUSOE ^ 24f 

I gave iim a knife, which he was wonderfully delij^hte^ 
with ; and I made him a belt with a frog hanging to it, such 
M in England we wear hangers in ; and in the frog, insteaci 
of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only ai 
good a weapon, in some cases, but much more useful upon 
other occasions. 

I described to him the country of Europe, particularl) 
England, which I came from ; how we lived, how we wor- 
shipped God, ^ow we behaved to one another, and how we 
traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave him an 
iccount of the wreck which I had been on board of, and 
showed him, as near as I could, the place where she lay ; 
but she was all beaten in pieces before, and gone. I showed 
him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we escaped, 
and which I could not stir with my whole strength then ; 
but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this 
boat, Friday stood musing a great while, and said nothing. 
I asked him what it was he studied upon ? At last, sayb 
he. Me see such boat . like come to place at my nation. 1 
4lid not understand him a good while ; but, at last, when 
I had examined farther into it, I understood by him, that a 
boat, such as that had been, came on shore upon the country 
where he lived; that is, as he explained it, was driven 
thither by stress of weather. I presently imagined that 
some European ship must have been cast away upon theu 
eoast, and the boat might get loose, and drive ashore ; but 
was so dull, that I never once thought of men making their 
escape from a wreck thither, much less whence they might 
tome : so I only inquired after a description of the boat. 

Friday described the boat to me well enough ; but 
brought me better to understand him when he added, with 
some warmth. We save the white mans from drown. Then 
I presently asked him, if there were any white mans, as he 
called them, in the boat ? Yes, he said ; the boat full oi 
white mans. I asked him how many ? He told upon hii 



250 • ADVENTURES OF 

fingers seventeen. 1 asked him then what became of tk«* 
He told me. They live, they dwell at my nation. 

This put new thoughts into my head; for I presently 
imagint i that these might be the men belonging to the ship 
that was cast away in the sight of my island, as I now called 
It : and who, after the ship was struck on the rock, and thej 
iaw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat 
and were landed upon that wild shore among the savages 
Upon this, 1 inquired of him more critically what was 
become of them ; he assured me they lived still there ; that 
they had been there about four years ; that the savages lot 
them alone, and gave them victuals to live on. I asked him 
how it came to pass they did not kill them, and eat them ?* 
He said. No, they make brother with them ; that is, as 1 
understood bim, a truce ; and then be added, They no eat 
mans but when the war fight ; that is to say, they never eat 
any men but such as come to fight mth them, and are taken 
in battle. 

It was after this some considerable 4ime, that, being upon 
the top of the hill, at the east side of the island, from 
whence, as I have said, I had, in a clear day, discovered the 
main or continent of America, Friday, the weather being 
very serene, looks very earnestly towards the main land, 
and, in a kind of surprise, falls a jumping and dancing, and 
calls out to me, for I was at some distance from him. I 
asked him what was the matter? joy ! says he ; O glad! 
tbere see my country, there my nation! I observed an 
extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his face, and his 
eyes sparkled, and bis countenance discovered a strange 
eagerness, as if be had a mind tc be in bis own country 
again. This observation of mine put a great many thoughts 
*nto me, which made me at first not so easy about my new 
man, I'riday, as I was before ; and I made no doubt but 
Jiat if Friday could get back to his own nation again, h€ 
flro lid not only forget all his reMgion, but all his obligatiOQ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 25i 

to me, and would be forward enough to give his coantrymet 
to account of me, and come back perhaps vith a hundred oi 
tvro of them, and make a feast upon me, at which he might 
be as merry as he used to be with those of his enemies, 
when they were taken in war. But I wronged the poor 
honest creature very much, for which 1 was very sorry after- 
wards ^ However, as my jealousy increased, and held me 
•ome weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not sc 
&mil ar and kind to him as before ; in which I was certainly 
in the wrong too ; the honest, grateful creature having no 
thought about it, but what consisted with the best princi- 
ples, both as a religious Christian, and as a grateful friend 
as appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction. 

While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I wsls 
every day pumping him, to see if he would discover any of 
the new thoughts which I suspected were in him: but I 
found everything he said was so honest and so innocent, 
that I could find nothing to nourish my suspicion ; and, in 
spite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his 
own again ; nor did he, in the least, perceive that I was 
uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit. 

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being 
hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I called 
to him, and said, Friday, do not you wish yourself in your 
own country, your own nation ? — Yes, he said, I be much 
O glad to be at my own nation. — What would you do 
there ? said I : would you turn wild again, eat men's flesh 
again, and be a savage, as you were before ? He looked full 
of concern, and shaking his head, said. No, no ; Friday tell 
them to live good, tell them to pray God, tell them to ca* 
corn-bread, cattle- flesh, milk ; no eat man again. — Why 
then, said I to him, they will kill you. He looked grave al 
mat, and then said. No, no ; they no kill mj, they willing 
love learn. He meant by this, they would be willing to 
learn He added, they learned much of the bearded msai

that came in the boat. Then I asked him if he woAid g$ 
back to them. He smiled at that, and told me he could not 
swim so far. 1 told him, I would make a canoe for him 
He* told me he would go, if I would go with him. I go } 
says I ; why, they will eat me, if I come there. — No, no, 
sajs he ; me make them no eat you ; me make them much 
love you. He meant, he would tell them how I had killed 
his enemies, and saved his life, and so he would make th^ni 
love me. Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind 
they were to seventeen white men. or bearded men, as he 
called them, who came on shore there in distress. 

From this time, I confess I had a mind to venture ever, 
and sec if I could, possibly join with those bearded men, 
who, I made no doubt, were Spanifirds and Portuguese : not 
doubting but if I could, we might find some method to 
<sc&pe from thence, being upon the continent, and a good 
company together, better than I could from an island forty 
fldles off the shore, and alone, without help. So, after some 
iays, I took Friday to work again, by way of discourse ; 
jind told him I would give him a boat to go back to his own 
aation ; and accordingly I carried him to my frigate, which 
(ay on the other side of the island, and having cleared it ol 
water (for I always kept it sunk in water) I brought it out. 
ihowed it him, and we both went into it. I fo\md he was 
a most dext-erous fellow at managing it, and would make it 
go almost as swift again as I could. So when he was in, 1 
said to him. Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your nation ^ 
He looked very dull at my saying so ; which, it, stems, was 
because he thought the boat too small to go so far ; I then 
told him I had a bigger ; so the next day I went to thci 
place where the first boat lay which I had made, but which 
I could not get into the water. He said that was big enough 
but then, as I had taken no care of it, and it had lain two 
or three ^and- twenty years there, the sun had split and dried 
|r» that iw was in a manner rotten. Friday told md such a 



ttOBINSON CRUSOB. 258 

thi*t would do very well, and would carry much enough 
rtv4e, drink, bread ; that was his way of talking. 

i/pon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon mj 
design of going over with him to the continent, that I' told 
hiia we would go and make one as big as that, and he should 
go aome in it. He answered not one word, but looked veiy 
grave and sad. I asked him what was the matter with Lim: 
He ivsked me again, Why you angry mad with Friday ? 
What me done ? I asked him what he meant ? I told him 
I was not angry with him at all. No angry ? says he, 
repeating the words several times ; Why send Friday home 
away to my nation? — Why, says I, Friday, did not you say 
you i^iched you were there ? — Yes, yes, says he, wish be 
both there ; no wish Friday there, no master there. In a 
word, he would not think of going there without me. 1 go 
there, Friday ! says I ; what shall I do there ? He returned 
very quick a^.^on me at this : You do fsfreat deal much good, 
.ays he ; you v=;ach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans ; 
you tell them Know God, pray God, and live new life.— 
Alas ! Friday, says I, thou knowest not what thou sayest ; 
I am but an ignorant man myself. — Yes, yes, says he, you 
ieachee me good, you teachee them good. — No, no, Friday, 
says I, you shall go without me, leave me here to live by 
myself, as I did before. He looked confused again at that 
word ; and running to one of the hatchets which he used to 
wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it to me. What 
must I do with this ? says I to him. You take kill Friday, 
says he. What must I kill you for ? said I again. He 
returns very quick, What you send Friday away for ? Take. 
"Tiill Friday, no send Friday away. This he spoke s'^ 
earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his eyes : in a word, I 
so plainly disco ve 'ed the utmost affection in him to ,<e^ and 
a firm resolution in him, that I told him then, and often 
after, that I would never send h.tn away firom me, i** he wti 
willing tc stay with me.

Upon the whole, as 1 found, by all his discoLrse, a settled 
RfFection to me, and that nothing should part him from me, 
so I found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own 
country was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and 
his hopes of my doing them good ; a thing, which, as 1 had 
no p^'tion of myself, so I had not th*^ least thought, or in- 
tention, or desire, of undertaking it But still I found a 
strong inclination to my attempting an escape, as above, 
founded on the supposition gathered from the discourse, viz., 
that there were seventeen bearded men there ; and, there- 
fore, without any more delay, I went to work with Friday, 
to find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a large 
periagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There were 
trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet, no* of 
periaguas, or canoes, but even of good large vessels ; but 
the main thing I looked at was, to get one so near the water 
that we might launch it when it was made, to avoid the 
mistake I committed at first. At last, Friday pitched upon 
a tree ; for I found he knew much better than 1 what kind 
of wood was fittest for it ; nor can I tell, to this day, what 
wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it was very 
like the tree wc call fustic, or between that and the Nicara- 
gua wood, for it was much of the same color and smell. 
Friday was for burning the hollow or cavity of this tree out, 
to make it for a boat, but I showed him how to cut it with 
tools ; which, after I had showed him how to use, he^ did 
very handily : and in about a month's hard labor we finished 
it, and made it very handsome ; especially when, with our 
axes, which I showed him how to handle, we cut and hewed 
the outside into the true shape of a boat. After this, how- 
ever, it cost us near a fortnight's time to get her along, as v 
wei3 inch by inch, upon great rollers, into the water; but 
when she was in, she would have carried twenty men witli 
peat ease. 

When she was in the water, and though sb^ was so ln§ 



ROBINSON CKUSOE 25d 

t mazed me to see with what dexterity, and how 6\*ift my 
In. 1 Friday would manage her, turn her, and paddle he; 
along. So I asked him if he would, and if we might, ven- 
ture over in her. Yes, he said ; we venture over in' hci 
very well, though great blow wind However, I had ji 
further design, that he knew nothing of, and tnat was td 
make a mast and a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and 
cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get : so 1 
pitched upon a straight young cedai tree, which I found 
near the place, and which there were great plenty of in the 
island ; and 1 set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave 
him directions how to shape and order it. But as to the 
sail, that was my particular care. 1 knew I had old sails, 
jr rather pieces of old sails, enough : but as I had had them 
now six-and-twenty years by me, and not been very careful 
to preserve them, not imagining that I should ever have this 
kind of use for them, I did not doubt but they were all 
rotten, and, indeed, most of them were so. However, I 
found two pieces, which appeared pretty good, and with 
these I went to work ; and with a great deal of pains, and 
awkward stitching, you niay be sure, for want of needles, I, 
at length, made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we 
tall in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom 
at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top, such as usually 
our ship*8 long-boats sail with, and such as I best knew how 
to manage, as it was such a one I had to the boat in which 
I made my escape from Barbary, as related in the first part 
of my story. 

I was near two months performing this last work, viz., 
ligging and fitting my mast and sails ; for 1 finished them 
Tery complete, making a tmall stay, and a sail, or foresail, 
tOsit, to assist, if we should turn to windward ; and, which 
was more than ail, I fixed a rudder to the stem of her to 
Iteer with. I was but a bungling shipwright, yet, as ] 
imew tlid usefulness, and even necessity of such a thing, 1 



^56 ADVENTURES OF 

applied my8 3lf with so much pains to do it, that at latl 
1 brought it to pass; though, considering the many dull 
contrivances I had for it that failed, I think it cost me almost 
as much labor as making the boat. 

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as 
to what belonged to the navigation of my boat ; for, though 
:ie knew very well how to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing 
what belonged to a sail and a rudder ; and was the most 
sanazed when he saw me work the boat to and again in the 
sea by the rudder, and how the sail gibbed, and filled this 
way, or that way, as the course we sailed changed ; I say, 
when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and amazed. 
However, with a little use, I made all these things familiar 
to him, and he became an expert sailor, except that, as to 
the compass I could make him understand very little of that. 
On the other hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, 
and seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there was the 
less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars were always to 
be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy 
seasons, and then nobody cared to stir abroad, either by land 
or sea. 

I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my 
captivity in this place ; though the three last years that I 
had this creature with me ought rather to be left out of the 
account, my habitation being quite of another kind than in 
all the rest of the time. I kept the anniversary of my land- 
ing here with the same thankfulness to Gk>d for his mercies 
as at first ; and if I had such cause of acknowledgment 
at first, I had much more so now, having such additiona'' 
teBtimonics of the care of Providence over me, and the great 
hopes I had of being effectually and speedly delivered ; fox 
I had an invincible impression upon my thoughts that my 
deliverance was at hand, and that I should not be anothei 
,vear in tils pla:se. I went on, however, with my husbindij: 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. J5-< 

^"guig, planting, and fencing, as usual. I ga tiered and 
eared my grapes, and did every necessary thing as before. 

The rainy season was, in the mean time, upon me, when 
I kept more within doors than at other times. We Lad 
stowed our own vessel as secure as we could, bringing hei 
up into the creek, where, as I said in the beginning, I landed 
my rafts from the ship ; and hauling her up to the shore, al 
high-water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, 
just big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give 
her water enough to float in ; and then, when the tide was 
out, we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep the 
water out ; and so she lay dry, as to the tide, from the sea : 
and to keep the rain off, we laid a great many boughs oJ 
trees, so thick, that she was as well thatched as a house ; 
and thus we waited for the months of November and Decem- 
ber, in which I designed to make my adventure. 

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought 
of my design returned with the fair weather, I was preparing 
daily for the voyage, and the first thing I did was to lay by 
a certain quantity of provisions, being the stores for our 
voyage ; and intended, in a week or a fortnight's time, to 
open the dock, and launch out our boat. I was busy one 
morning ui>on something of this kind, when I called to 
Friday, and bid him go to the sea-shore, and see if he cou'd 
find a tiurtle, or tortoise, a thing which we generally got 
once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well as the flesh 
Friday ^ad not been long gone, when he came running back, 
and flew over my outer wall, or fence, like one that felt not 
the ground, or the steps he set his feet on ; and before I had 
time to speak to him, he cries out to me, O master! C 
master ! O sorrow ! O bad ! — What's the matter, Friday ? 
iays J. O yonder, there, says he, one, two, three canoe ; 
one, two, three ! By this way of speaking, I concluded 
ihere were six ; but, on inquiry, I ^ound it was but three

160 ADVENTURES OF 

^e cause info his own handt:, and, by national vengeance, 
punish them, as a people, for national crimes ; but that, ii 
the mean time, it was none of my business ; that, it wai 
true, Friday might justify it, because he was a declared 
enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular 
people, and it was lawful for him to attack them; but 1 
could not say the same with respect to myself. These things 
were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I 
went, that I resolved I would only go and place myself near 
them, that I might observe their barbarous feast, and that 1 
would act then as God should direct : but that, unless some- 
thing offered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, 
I would not meddle with them. 

With this resolution I entered the wood ; and, with all 
possible wariness and silence, Friday following close at my 
heels, I marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the 
iide which was next to them, only that one comer of the 
wood lay between me and them. Here I called softly to 
Friday, and showing him a great tree, which was just at the 
comer of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me 
word if he could see there plainly what they were doing. 
He did so ; and came immediately back to me, and told me 
they might be plainly viewed there; that they were all 
about their fire, eating the flesl^ of one of their prisoners, 
and that another lay bound upon the sand, a little from 
them, which, he said, they would kill next, and which fired 
all the very soul within me. He told me it was not one oi 
their nation, but one of the bearded men he had told me of, 
that came to their country in the boat. I was filled with 
horror at the very naming the white bearded man ; and, 
going to the tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, 
who lay upon the beach of the sea, with his hands and his 
^et tied with flags, or things like rushes, and that he wai 
in European, and had clothes on. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it

%bout fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I MtLSt 
which, by going a little way about, I saw I might come a 
undiscovered, and that then I should be within half a shot 
of them ; so I withheld my passion, though I was indeed 
enraged to the highest degree ; and going back about twenty 
paces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the way tiLi 
I came to tha other tree ; and then came to a little rising 
ground, which gave me a full view of them, at the Hstance 
of about eighty yards.

AOBIKSON RBLBA8B8 A SPANIARD — FRIDAY DISCOVERS BIS FATHER — 
ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED FOR THESE NEW GUESTS — WHO ARl 
A.FTERWARD8 SENT TO LIBERATE THE OTHER SPANIARDS — ARRIVAL 
OF, AN ENGLISH VESSEL. 

I HAD now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dread- 
ful wretches sat upon the ground, all close-huddled together, 
and had just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, 
and bring him, perhaps limb by limb, to their fire ; and they 
were stooping down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned 
to Friday — Now, Friday, said I, do as I bid thee. Friday 
said he would. Then, Friday, says I, do exactly as you see 
me do ; fail in nothing. So I set down one of the musketa 
and the fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the 
like by his ; and with my other musket I took my aim ai 
the savages, bidding him to do the like : then asking him li 
he was ready, he said. Yes. Then fire at them, said I ; and 
the same moment I fired also. 

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the 
•ide that he shot, he killed two of Ihem, and wounded 
^luree irore ; and on my side, I killed one, and wounded 



152 ADVENTURES OP 

two. They were, you may be sure, in a drealful consterna^ 
tion ; and aL of them who were not hurt jun.ped upon theil 
feet, but did not immediately know which way to run, of 
which way to look, for they knew not from whence the'it 
destruction came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me that, 
as I had bid him, he might observe what I did ; so, as soon 
as the first shot was made, I threw down the piece, and took 
up the -fowling-piece, and Friday did the like : he saw me 
cock and present ; he did the same again. Are you ready, 
Friday ? said I. Yes, says he. Let fly, then, says I, in the 
lame of God ! And with that, I fired again among the 
amazed wretches, and so did Friday ; and as our pieces were 
now loaded with what I called swan-shot, or small pistol- 
bullets, we found only two drop, but so many were wounded, 
that they ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures, 
all bloody, and most miserably wounded, whereof three 
more fell quickly after, though not quite dead. 

Now, Friday, says I, laying down the discharged pieces, 
and taking up the musket which was yet loaded, follow me ; 
which he did, with a great deal of courage ; upon which 1 
rushed out of the wood, and showed myself, and Friday 
close at my foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me, I 
shouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too ; and 
running as fast as I could, which, by the way, was not very 
fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I made directly 
towards the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the 
beach, or shore, between the place where they sat and the 
sea. The two butchers, who were just going to work with 
him, had left him at the surprise of our first fire, and fled in 
a terrible fright to the sea-side, and had jumped into a canoe, 
and three more of the rest made the same way. I turned 
!o Friday, and bade him step forwards, and fire at them ; ha 
understood me immediately, and running about forty yards, 
to be nearer them, he shot at them, and I thought he had 
killed them all, for I saw them all fall of a heap into th« 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 265 

boat, Ui(mgli I saw two of them up again quicUy however, 
he killed two of them, and wounded the third, so that he 
iay down in the bottom of the boat as if he had been 
dead. 

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my 
knife, and cut the flags that bound the poor victim ; and 
loosing his hands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked him in 
(he Portuguese tongue, what he was. He answerd in Lati^i, 
(yuristianus ; but was so weak and faint that he could scarce 
stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket, and 
gave it him, making signs that he should drink, which h» 
did ; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he ate. Then 
I asked him what countryman he was : and he said, Espag- 
niole ; and being a little recovered, let me know, by all the 
signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my debt 
for his deliverance. Signor, said I, with as much Spanish 
as I could make up, we will talk afterwards, but we must 
fight now : if you have any strength left, take this pistol 
and sword, and lay about you. He took them very thank- 
fully ; and no sooner had he the arms in his hands, but, aa 
if they had put new vigor into him, he flew upon his 
murderers like a ftiry, and had cut two of them in pieces 
in an instant ; for the truth is, as the whole was a surprise 
to them, so the poor creatures were so much frightened 
;rith the noise of our pieces, that they fell down for 
mere amazement and fear, and had no more power to attempt 
their own escape, than their flesh had to resist our shot ; 
and that was the case of those five that Friday shot at iu 
the boat; for as three of them fell with the hurt they 
received, so the other two fell with the fright. 

I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being 
Hilling to keep my charge ready, because I had given the 
Spaniard my pistol and sword : so I called to Friday, a nd 
hade him run up to the tree from whence we first fired, and 
fetch the vrms which lay there that had been discharged, 



264 ADVENTURES OF 

which he did with great swiftness ; and then giVing him my 
musket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and 
bade them come to me when they wanted. While I was 
loading these pieces, there happened a fierce engagemczkt 
between the Spaniard and one of the savages, whc made at 
him with one of- their great wooden swords, the tame-like 
weapon that was to have killed him before, if I had not 
prevented it. The Spaniard, who was as bold and brave as 
CO aid be imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian a 
good while, and had cut him two good wounds on his head ; 
but the savage being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with 
him, had thrown him down, being faint, and was wringing 
my sword out of his hand ; when the Spaniard though 
undermost wisely quitting the sword, drew the pistol from 
his girdle, shot the savage through the body, and killed him 
upon the spot, before I, who was ruhning to help him, could 
come near him. 

Friday being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying 
wretches, with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet ; and 
with that he dispatched those three, who, as I said before, 
were wounded at first, and fallen, and all the rest he could 
rome up with : and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I 
gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued 
two of the savages, and wounded them both ; but, as he was 
not able to run, they both got from him into the wood, 
where Friday pursued them, and killed one of them, but the 
dther was too nimble for him ; and though he was wounded, 
yet had plunged himself into the sea, and swam, with all 
his might, off to those two who were left in the canoe, which 
three in the canoe, with one wounded, that we knew not 
whether he died or no, were all that escaped our hands ol 
ono-and-twenty. The account of the whole is as follows : 
three killed at our first shot from the tree ; two killed at the 
aext shot ; two killed by Friday in the boat ; two killed by 
Friday of those at first wounded ; one killed by Friday ii

ROBINSON OKU8U 26* 

Axe wood ; tnrce killed by the Spaniard ; four killed, being 
found dropped here and there of their wounds, or killed by 
Friday in his chase of them ; four escaped in the boat 
whereof one wounded, if not dead. — Twenty-one in all. 

Those that were in their canoe worked hard to get out o 
gunshot, and though Friday made two or three shots at them. 
I did not find that he hit any of them. Friday would fain 
have had me take one of there canoes, and pursue them ; 
and indeed, I was very anxious about their escape. Jest, 
carrying the news home to their people, they should come 
back perhaps with two or three hundred of the canoes, and 
devour us by mere multitude ; so I consented to pursue them 
by sea, and running to one of their canoes, I jumped in, and 
bade Friday follow me ; but when I was in the canoe, I wa« 
surprised to find another poor creature lie there, bound hand 
and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and almost 
dead with fear, not knowing what was the matter ; for he 
had not been able to look over the side of the boat, he was 
tied so hard neck and heels, and had been tied so long, that 
he had really but little life in him. 

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they 
had bound him with, and would have helped him up ; but 
he could not stand or speak, but groaned most piteously, 
believing, it seems, still, tluit he was only unbound in order 
to be killed. When Friday came to him, I bade him speak 
to Hm, and tell him of his deliverance ; and, pulling out my 
bottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram ; which, with 
the news of his being delivered, revived him, and he sat up 
in the boat. But when Friday came to hear him speak, and 
look in his face, it would have moved any one into tears to 
have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged 
him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung ; 
then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and 
head ; and then sung and jumped about again, like a dis' 
^acted creature. It was a good while before I could makt 
23

him speak to me, or tell me wliat was the matter; ba* 
when he came a little to himself, he told me that it was hif> 
father. 

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to set 
what ecstacy and filial affection had worked in this pool 
savage at the sight of his father, and on his being delivered 
from death ; nor, indeed, can I describe half the extravagan* 
cies of his affection after this ; for he went into the boat, 
and out of the boat, a great many times : when he went in 
to him, he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold 
his father's head close to his bosom for many minutes 
together, to nourish it ; then he took his arms and ancles, 
which were numbed and stiff with the binding, and chafed 
and rubbed them with his hands ; and I, perceiving what 
the case was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub 
them with, which did them a great deal of good. 

This affi^ put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with 
ihe other savages, who were got now almost out of sight; 
and it was happy for us that we did not, for it blew so hard 
within two hourf after, and before they could be got a 
quarter of their way, and continued blowing so hard all 
night, and that from the north-west, which was against them, 
that I could not suppose their boat could live, or that they 
ever reached their own coast. 

But, to return to Friday ; he was so busy about his father* 
that I could not find in my heart to take him off for some 
time : but after I thought he coxild leave him a little, I called 
him to me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleaded 
to the highest extreme ; then I asked him if he had given 
his father any bread. He shook his head, and said. None ; 
ogly dog eat all up self. I then gave him a cake of bread, 
out of a little pouch I carried on purpose : I also gave him 
a dram for himself, but he would not taste it, but carried it 
to hit father. I had in my pocket two or three bunches 61 



ROBINSON CllUSOE. 267 

raisins, so 1 gave him a handful of them for his father. Ha 
nad no sooner given his father these raisins, but I saw him 
come out of the boat, and run away, as if he had been 
bewitched, he ran at such a rate: for he was the swiftest 
fellow on his feet that ever I saw : I say, he ran at such a 
rate, that he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant ; and 
though I called, and hallooed out too, after him, it was aU 
one way, away he went ; and in a quarter of an hour I saw 
him come back again, though not so fast as he went ; and as 
he came nearer, I found his pace slacker, because he had 
something in his hand. When he came up to me, I found 
he had been quite home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring 
his father some fresh water, and that he had two more cakes . 
or loaves of bread ; the bread he gave me, but the water he 
carried to his father ; however, as I was very thirsty too, I 
took a little sup of it. The water revived his father more 
than all the rum or spirits I had given him, for he was just 
fainting with thirst. 

When his father had drunk, I called to him to know if 
there was any water left ; he said. Yes ; and I bade him 
give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in as much want of it 
as his father: and 1 sent one of the cakes that Friday 
brought to the Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, 
md was reposing himself upon a green place under the 
^hade of a tree ; and whose limbs were also very stiff, and 
very much swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied 
with. When I saw that, upon Friday's coming to him with 
(be water, he sat up and drank, and took the bread, and 
began to eat, I went to him and gave him a handful of rai- 
sins : he looked up in my face with all the tokens of grati- 
tude and thankfulness that could appear in any countenance; 
but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted himsell

%nkle8 were so swelled and so painful to liiir»; so I Jddf 
him sit sti)), ind caused Friday to rub his ancles, and batb« 
them with rum, as he had done his father's. 

I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two 
minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was here, turn hig 
head about to see if his father was in the same place and 
posture as he left him sitting ; and at last he found he wai 
not to be seen ; at which he started up, and, without speak* 
ing a word, flew with that swiftness to him, that one could 
Rcarce perceiv e his feet to touch the ground as he went : but 
when he came, he only found he had lain himself down to 
ease his limbs, so Friday came back to me presently ; and 
.then I spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up, ii 
he could, and lead him to the boat, and then he should carry 
him to our dwelling, where 1 would take care of him: but 
Friday, a lusty strong fellow, took the Spaniard quite upon 
his back, and carried him away to the boat, and set him 
down softly upon the side or gunnel of the canoe, with his 
feet in the inside of it ; and then, lifting him quite in, he 
set himself close to his father ; and presently stepping out 
again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore 
faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard 
too ; so he brought them both safe into our creek, and 
leaving them in the boat, ran away to fetch the other canoe. 
As he passed me, 1 spoke to him, and asked him whither he 
went. He told me. Go fetch more boat : so away he went 
like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like him ; 
and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I 
got to il by land ; so he wailed me over, and then went tc 
help our new guests out of the boat, which he did; but 
they were neither of them able to walk, so that poor Friday 
knew not what to do. 

To remedy this, I went t? work in my thoughts, and ruli- 
ng to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while h6 
lame to me, 1 soon made a kind of a land-barrow to laj

ihein on, and Friday and I carried them both up togethei 
upon it, between us. But when we got them to the cutsidfl 
of our wall, or fortification, we were at a worse less than 
before, for it was impossible to get them over, and I wai 
resolved not to break it down ; so I set to work again ; and 
Friday and I, in about two hours' time, made a very hacd* 
Bome tent, covered with old sails,^ and above that with 
boughs of trees, being in the space without our outward 
fence, and bet\^een that and the grove of young wood which 
I had planted : and here we made them two beds of such 
things as I had, viz., of good rice straw, with blankets laid 
upon it, to lie on, and another to cover them, on each bed. 

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself rich in 
subjects : and it was a merry reflection, which I frequently 
made, how like a king I looked. First of all, the whole 
country was my own mere property, so that I had an un- 
doubted right of dominion. Secondly, my people were 
perfectly subjected ; I was absolutely lord and lawgiver ; 
they all o\yed their lives to me, and were ready to lay down 
their lives, if there had been occasion for it, for me. It was 
remarkable, too, I had but three subjects, and they were oi 
three different religions : my man Friday was a Protestant, 
his father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard 
was a Papist : however, I allowed liberty of conscience 
throughout my dominions. — But this is by the way. 

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners, 
and given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, 1 
began to think of making some provision for them : and the 
first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, 
betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particulw flock, to be 
killed ; when I cut off the hinder quarter, and chopping i* 
into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stew- 
ing, and made them a very good dish, I assure you, of flesL 
and br^th, hanng put some barky and rice also into tht 
ti>th ; and as I cooked it without doors, for I Tiade no fir«

w.tliin my inner wall, so I earned it all into the nei% («n<| 
and having set a table there for them, I sat down, and at« 
my dinner also with them, and, as well as I could, cheered 
them, and encouraged them. Friday was my interpreter, 
especially to his father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard too ; 
for the Spaniard spoke the language of the savages prettj 
well. 

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to 
tdke one of the canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and 
other fire arms, which, for want of time, we had left upon 
the place of battle : and, the next day, I ordered him to go 
and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open to 
the sun, and would presently be offensive. I also ordered 
him to bufy the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, 
which I knew were pretty much, and which I could not 
think of doing myself; nay, 1 could not bear to see them, 
if I went that way ; all which he punctually performed, and 
effaced the very appearance of the savages being there ; so 
that when I went again, 1 could scarce know where it was, 
otherwise than by the comer of the wood pointing to the 
place. 

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my 
two new subjects : and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his 
father what he thought of the escape of the savages in that 
eanoe, and whether we might expect a return of them, with 
a power too great for us to resist. Hb first opinion was, 
that the savages in the boat could . never live out the storm 
which blew that night they went off, but must of necessity 
be drowned, or driven south to those other shores, where 
they were as sure to be devoured as they were to be 
drowned, if they were cast away ; but, as to what they 
would do, if they came safe on shore, he said he knew not ; 
but it was his opinion, that they were so dreadfully 
frightened with the manner of their being attacked, the 
noise ^ and the fre, that he believed ^ey would tell thfl 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 275 

people they were all killed by thunder and lightning, not bj 
the hand of man ; and that the two which appeared, viz., 
Frixlay and I, were two heavenly spirits, or furies, com* 
down to destroy them, and not men with weapons. This, 
he said, he knew ; because he heard ihem all cry out so, in 
their language one to another ; for it was impossille fur 
them to conceive that a man could dart fiie, and spe.iji 
thunder, and kill at a distance, without lifting up the hand, 
as wa^ done now : and this old savage was in the right ; 
for, as I understood siiice, by other hands, the savages neve/ 
attempted to go over to the island afterwards, they wc?re so 
terrified with the accounts given by those four men (for, it 
seems, they did escape the sea), that they believed whoever 
went to that enchanted island would be desti^yed by fire 
from the gods. This, however, I knew not ; and therefore 
was under continual apprehensions for a good while, and 
kept always upon my guard, with all my army ; for, as there 
were now four of us, I woxild have ventured upon a hundred 
of them, fairly in the open field, at any time. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the 
fear of their coming wore ofi*; and I began to take my 
former thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration ; 
being likewise assured, by Friday's father, that I might 
depend upon good usage from their nation, on his account, 
if I would go. But my thoughts were a little suspended 
when I had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when 
I understood that there were sixteen more of his country- 
men and Portugese, who, having been cast away, and made 
their escape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with 
the savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries, and 
Indeed for life. I asked him all the particulars of their 
royage, and found they were a Spanish ship, bound from 
the Rio de h Plata, to the Havana, being directed to leave 
their loading there, which was chiefly hides i^nd silver, and 
i<» bring baok what European goods they coul<^ meet witk

there j that they had five Portugese seamen on board, when 
they took out of another wreck ; that five of their own mer 
were drowned, when first the ship was lost, and that these 
escaped through infinite dangers and hazards, and arrived, 
almost starved, on the cannibal coast, where they expected 
to have been devoured every moment. He told me they 
had some arms with them, but they were perfectly usele^*, 
for that they had neither powder nor ball, the washing oi 
the sea having spoiled all their powder, but a little, which 
they used at their first landing, to provide themselves some 
food. 

r asked him what he thought would become of them 
there, and if they had formed no design of making any 
escape. He said they had many consultations about it ; but 
that having neither vessel, nor tools to build one, nor pro- 
visions of any kind, their councils always ended in tears and 
despair. I asked him how he thought they would receive a 
proposal fi-om me, which might tend towards an escape ; and 
whether, if they were all here, it might not be done. I told 
him, with freedom, I feared mostly their treachery and ill- 
usage of me, if I put my life in their hands, for that grati- 
tude was no inherent virtue in the nature of man, nor did 
men always square their dealings by the obligations they 
had received, so much as they did by the advantages they 
expected. I told him it would be very hard that I should 
be the instrument of their deliverance, and that they should 
afterwards make me their prisoner in New Spain, where an 
Englishman was certain to be made a sacrifice, what ncces*. 
•ity, or what accident soever brought him thither ; and that 
1 had rather be delivered up to savages, and be devoured 
%live, than fall into the merciless claws of the priests, and le 
3? Tried into the Inquisition. I added, that otherwise I waf 
persuaded, if tl* ?y were all here, we might, with so many 
%ands, build a bark large enough to carry us all away, eithei 
to th) Brazils, southward, or to the blands, or Spanish coast

Aorthwaid ; but that if, in requital, they should, when J had 
put weapons into their hands, carry me by force among theii 
own people, I might be ill used for my kindness to them 
and make my case worse than it was before. 

He answered with a great deal of candor and ingenuous 
ness, that their condition was so miserable, and they were 
sc sensible of it, that he believed they would abhor the 
thought of using any man unkindly that should contribute 
to theii deliverance ; and that, if I pleased, he would go to 
them with the old man, and discourse with them about it, 
and return again, and bring me their answer ; that he would 
make conditions with them upon their solemn oath, that they 
should be absolutely under my leading, as their commander 
and captain^ and that they should swear upon the holy 
sacraments and gospel, to be true to me, and go to such 
Christain country as I should agree to, and no other, and to 
be directed wholly and absolutely by my orders, till they 
were landed safely in such country as I intended ; and that 
he would bring a contract from them, under their hands, for 
that purpose. Then he told me he would first swear to me 
himself, that he would never stir from me as long as he lived, 
till I gave him orders ; and that he would take my side to 
the last drop of his blood, if there should happen the least 
breach of faith among his countrymen. He told me they 
were all very '^ivil, honest men, and they were under the 
greatest distress imaginable, having neither weapons, noi 
clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of the 
savages; out of all hopes of ever returning to their own 
coiAtry ; and that he was sure, if I would xmdertake their 
relief, they would live and die by me. 

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve 
them, if possible, and to send the old savage and this Span- 
lard over to them to treat. But when we got all things in 
readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started an objection^ 
which had so much prudence in it, on one hand, and so much 



274 ADVENTURES Or 

sincerity, on the other hand, that I could not but be verj 
well satisfied in it ; and, by his advice, put oflf the deliver- 
ance of his comrades for at least half a year. The caae wai 
thus : He had been with us now about a month, during 
which time, I had let him see in what manner 1 had provided, 
with the assistance of Providence, for my support ; and he 
law evidently what stock of com and rice I had laid up ; 
which, though it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it 
was not sufficient, without good husbandry, for my family, 
aow it was increased to four; but much less would it be 
sufficient if his countrymen, who were, as he said, sixteen, 
Btili alive, should come over ; and least of all would it be 
sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should build one, for a 
voyage to any of the Christain colonies of America ; so he 
told me he thought it would be more advisable to let him 
and the other two dig and cultivate more land, as much as I 
could spare seed to sow, and that we should wait another 
harvest, that we should have a supply of com for his 
countrymen, when they should come ; for want might be a 
temptation to them to disagree, or not to think themselves 
delivered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into another. 
You know, says he, the children of Israel, though they 
rejoiced at first for their being delivered out of Egypt, yet 
rebelled even against God himself, that delivered them, when 
they came to want bread in the Wilderness. 

His caution was so seasonable, and his voice so good, that 
[ could not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as 
well as I was satisfied with his fidelity ; so we fell to digging 
dll four of us, as well as the wooden tools permitted ;^and 
in about a month's time, by the end of which it was seed- 
time, we had got as much land cured and trimmed up as we 
•owed two and twenty bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars 
of rice ; which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare ; 
oor, indeed, did we leave ourselves barley sufficient for oui 
•WD food, for the six months that we had to expect rur crop* 



KOBINSON CKrSOB 37^ 

ttkat is to say, reckoning from the time we set our seed asidf 
for sowing ; for it is not to be supposed it is six months in 
the ground in that country. 

Having now society enough, and our number being 
iufficient to put us out of fear of the savages if they 
had come, unless their number had been very great, we 
wenJ^ freely all over the illand, whenever we found occa- 
•ion: and as here we had our escape or deliverance upoo 
our thoughts, it was impossible, at least for me, to have the 
meass of it out of mine. For this purpose, I marked out 
several trees which I thought fit for our work, and I set 
Friday and his father to cutting them down; and then 1 
caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thought on 
that affair, to oversee and direct their work. I showed 
them with what indefatigable pains I had hewed a large 
tree into single planks, and I caused them to do the like, 
till they had made about a dozen large planks of good oak, 
near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two 
inches to four inches thick : what prodigious labor it took 
up, any one may imagine. 

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock ot 
tame goats as much as I could ; and, for this purpose, I made 
Friday and the Spaniard go out one day, and myself witli 
Friday the next day (for we took our turns), and by this 
means we got about twenty young kids to breed up with the 
rest : for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and 
added them to our flock. But, above all, the season for 
curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious 
quantity to be hung up in the sun, that, I believe, had w© 
been at Alicant, where the raisins of the sun are cured, we 
eotdd have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with 
our bread, was a great part of our food, and was a very good 
living, too, I assure you, for it is exceedingly nourishing. 

It was now harvest, and out crop in good order : it wai 
not tb' ^ost plentiful increase I had seen in the island, bu*

however, it was enough to answer our end ; for from t^renty 
t^'o bushels of barley we brought in and threshed out abov« 
two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in proportioc 
of the rice ; which was store enough for our food to the next 
harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore 
with me ; or if we had been ready for a voyage, it would 
very pU ntifully have victualled otir ship to have cairied us 
to any part of the world, that is to say, any part of America. 
When we had thus housed and secured our magazine ol 
•cm, we fell to work to make more wickerware, viz., great 
oaskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was very 
landy and dexterous at this part, and often blamed me that 
[ did not make some things for defence of this kind of work ; 
Jilt I saw no need of it. 

And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests 1 
ixpected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to 
^e what he could do with those he had left behind him there. 
< gave him a strict charge not to bring any man ^vith him .vho 
would not first swear in the presence of himself and the old 
ravage, that he would no way injure, fight with, or attack 
<be person he should find in the island, who was so kind di 
to send for them in order to their deliverance ; but that they 
would stand by him, and defend him against all sucl 
a*:tempts, and wherever they went, would be entirely undei 
and subjected to his command ; and that this should be put 
in writing, and signed with their hands. How they were to 
have done this, when I knew they had neither pen nor ink; 
was a question which we never asked. Under these instruc- 
tions, the Spaniard and the old savage, the father of Friday, 
went away in one of the canoes which they might be said Ui 
come in, or rather were brought in, when they came aa 
prisoners to be devoured by the savages. I gave each oi 
them a muske:, with a firelock on it, and about eight 
ihargeA of pow ler and ball, charging them to be very goo^

kiosbands of both, ar.d not to use either of iheni but upon 
urgent occasions. 

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by 
jae, in view of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven yeari 
and some days. I gave them provisions of bread, and ol 
dried grapes, sufficient for themselves for many days, and 
sufficient for all the Spaniards for about eight days' time ; 
ind wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go ; agreeing 
inth them about a signal that they should hang out at their 
return, by which I should know them again, when they 
came back, at a distance, before they came on shore. They 
went away with a fair gale, on the day that the moon was 
at full, by my account in the month of October ; but as for 
an exact reckoning of days, after I had once lost it, I could 
never recover it again ; nor had I kept even the number of 
years so pmnctually as to be sure I was right ; though, as il 
proved, when I afterwards examined my account, I found 1 
had kept a true reckoning of years. 

It was no less than eight days I had waited for them 
when a strange and unforseen accident intervened, of which 
the like has not perhaps been heard of in history. I wai 
fast asleep in my hutch, one morning, when my man Friday 
came running in to me, and called aloud, master, master, 
they are come, they are come ! I jumped up, and, regardless 
of danger, I went out as soon as I could get my clothes on, 
through my little grove, which by the way, was by this time 
grown to be a very thick wood ; I say, regardless of danger, 
J went without my arms, which it was not my custom to do , 
but I was surprised, when turning my eyes to the aea, 1 
presently saw a boat about a league and a half distance, 
standing in for the shore, with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as 
they call it, and the mnd blowing pretty fair to bring them 
i^i; also 1 observed presently, that they did not come from 
ihat side which the shore lay on, but from the southemmosi

end of the island. Upon this, I called Fri lay in, an»\ bad* 
bim lie close, for these were not the people we looked for 
and that we might not know yet whether they were friendi 
or enemies. In the next place, I went in to fetch my 
perspective glass, to see what I could make of them; and 
having taken the ladder out, I climbed to the top of the 
hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of anything, 
and to take my view the plainer without being discovered. 
I had scarce set my foot upon the hill, when my eye plainly 
discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at about two leagues and 
a half distance from me, S.S.E., but not above a league 
and a half from the shore. By my observation, it appeared 
plainly to be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be 
an English long-boat. 

I cannot express the confusion I was in ; though the joy 
#f seeing a ship, and one that I had reason to believe was 
manned by my own countrymen, and, consequently, friends, 
was such as I cannot describe ; but yet I had some secret 
doubts hang about me — I cannot tell from whence they 
came, bidding me keep upon my guard. In the first place 
it occurred to me to consider what business an English ship 
could have in that part of the world, since it was not the 
way to or from any part of the world where the English 
had any traffic; and I knew there had been no storms to 
drive them in there, as in distress ; and that if they were 
really English, it was most probable that they were here 
upon no good design ; and that I had better continue as I 
was, than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers. 

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger, 
which sometimes are given him when he may think there is 
no possibility of its being real. That such hints and 
notices are given us, I believe few that ha\e made any 
Dbacrvations of things can deny ; that they are certain 
disco verioe of an invisible worli, and a converse of spiritt, 
we cannot doubt; and if the tendency of them seems ic 



ROBINSON CKUSOE. 27t 

•^ to warn U8 of danger, why should we not £ . ppose thej 
Are fri)ra some friendly agent (whether supreme or inferioi 
*nd subordinate, is not the question), and that they ar^ 
given for our good ? 

The present question abundantly confirms me in the 
justice of this reasoning ; for had I not been made cautious 
by this secret admonition, come it from whence it will, I h&d 
been undone inevitably, and in a far worse condition than 
before, as you will see presently. I had not kept mysell 
long in this posture, but I saw the boat draw near the 
shore, as 'f they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the 
convenience of landing ; however, as they did not come quitt 
far enough, they did not see the little inlet where I formerly 
landed my rafts, but run their boat on shore upon the 
beach, at about half a mile from me, which was very 
happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed just 
at my door, as I may say, and would soon have beaten me 
out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered me of all I 
had. When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied they 
were Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two 1 
thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so ; there were in 
all eleven men, whereof three of them I found were unarmed, 
and, as I thought, bound ; and when the first four or five 
of them were jumped on shore, they took those three out ol 
the boat as prisoners ; one of the three I could perceive 
using the most passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, 
and despair, even to a kind of extravagance ; the other 
two I could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and 
appeared concerned, indeed, but not to such a degree as 
the first. I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and 
knew not what the meaning of it should be. Friday called 
out to me in English, a^ well as he could, O master ! you 
wce English mans eat prisoner as well as savage mans.— - 
Why, Friday, says I, do you think they are going to eat 
thim then? — Yos, says Friday, they will eat them. — No 



280 ADVENTURES OF 

no, says I, Friday; I am afraid they will m».rdei thtia, 
indeed, but you may be sure they will not eat them. 

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really 
was, but stood trembling with the horror of the sight, 
expecting every moment when the three prisoners should b$ 
killed ; nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up his arm 
with a great cutlass, as the seamen call it, or sword, to 
strike one of the poor men ; and I expected to see him fall 
every moment ; at which all the blood in my body seemed to 
run chill in my veins. 1 wished heartily now for my 
Spaniard, and the savage that was gone with him, or that 1 
had any way to have come undiscovered within shot of them, 
that I might have rescued the three men, for I saw no fire- 
arms they had among them ; but it fell out to my mind 
another way. After I had observed the outrageous usage of 
\he three men by the insolent seamen, I. observed the fellows 
run scattering about the island, as if they wanted to see the 
country. I observed that the three other men had liberty 
to go also where they pleased ; but they sat down all three 
upon the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in 
despair. This put me in mind of the first time when I came 
on shore, and began to look about me : how I gave mysel 
over for lost ; how wildly 1 looked around me ; what dreac- 
ful apprehensions I had ; and how 1 lodged in the tree a*l 
night, for fear of being devoured by wild beasts. As 1 
knew nothing that night of the supply I was to receive by 
the providential driving of the ship nearer the land by the 
•torms and tide, by which I have since been so long 
nourished and supported ; so these three poor desolate men 
knew nothing how certain of deliverance and supply they 
were, h')w near it was to them, and how eflectually and 
really they were in a condition oi safety, at the same time 
tnat they thought themselves lost, and their case desperate. 
So little do we see before us in the world, and so much 
rtason have we to depend ch«'».rfiilly upon the preat Mako*

SECTION XXVI. 

■OBnrSON DISCOVERS HIMSELF TO THE ENGLISH CAPTAIN— ASBISff 
HIM IN REDUCING HIS MUTINOUS CHEW, WHO SUBMIT TO HIM. 

It was just at the top of high water when these people 
came on shore ; and partly while they rambled about to see 
what kind of a place they were in, they had carelessly stayeo 
till the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed considera- 
bly away, leaving their boat aground. They had left two 
men in the boat, who, as I found afterwards, having drunk a 
little too much brandy, fell asleep ; however, one of them 
waking a little sooner than the other, and finding the boat 
coo fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed out to the rest, 
who were straggling about ; upon which they all soon came 
60 the boat ; but it was past all their strength to launch her, 
ihe boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side leing 
a soft oozy sand, almost like a quicksand. In this condi- 
tion, like true teamen, who are perhaps the least of all 
tnankind given to forethought, they gave it over, and away 
they strolled about the country again ; and I heard one ol 
them say aloud to another, calling them off from the boat. 
Why, let her alone. Jack, can't you ? she'll float next tide : 
by rhich I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of wha 
eouX:*Tymen they were. All this while I kept my sol' v<»ti

elose, not once daring to stir out of my castle, any farthft* 
than to my place of ajservation, near the top of the hill ; 
and very glad I was to think how well it was fortified. 1 
knew it was no less than ten hours before the boat could 
float again, and by that time it would be dark, and I migh^ 
be at more liberty to see their motions, and to hear theii 
discourse, if they had any. In the mean time, I fitted 
myself up for a battle, as before, though with more caution, 
knowing I had to do with another kind of enemy than I 
had at first. I ordered Friday also, whom I had made an 
excellent marksman with his gun, to load himself with 
arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him 
three muskets. My figure, indeed, was very fierce ; I hijid 
my formidable goats' skin coat on, with the great cap I have 
mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my 
belt, and a gun upon each shoulder. 

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any 
attempt till it was dark : but about two o'clock, being the 
heat of the day, I found that, in short, they were all gone 
straggling into the woods, and as I thought, laid down to 
sleep. The three poor distressed men, too anxious for their 
condition to get any sleep, were, however, sat down under 
the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from 
me, and, as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest. Upon 
this I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn some- 
thing of their condition ; immediately I marched in the 
figure as above, my man Friday at a good distance behind 
me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite so 
itaricg a spectre-like figure as I did. I came as near them 
undiscovered as I coild, and then, before any of them sau 
me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, What are ye, gentle- 
men } They started up at the noise ; but were ten times 
more confounded wLm they saw me, anil the uncouth figure 
that I made. They made no answer at all, but I thought ]

you put u. stranger in the way how to help you ? for you

landed ; and when you seemed to make supplication to the 
brutes that came with you, I saw one of them lift up hia

The poor )nan, with tears running down his face, and 
trembling, looking like one astonished, returned, Am I talk* 
ing to God or man ? Is it a real man or an angel ? - — Be iz 
no fear about that, sir, said I ; if God had sent an angel to 
relieve you, he would have come better clothed, and armed 
after another manner than you see me : pray lay aside your 
fears ; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist

commander of that ship, my men have mutinied against 
me ; they have been hardly prevailed on not to murder me j 
and at last have set me on shore in this desolate place, with 
these two men with me, one my mate, the other a passenger, 
where we expected to perish, believing the place to be 
uninhabited, and know not yet what to think of it. — W'neie 
are these brutes, your enemies ? said I : do you know w uere 
they are gone ? — There they lie, sir, said he, pointing to a 
thicket of trees ; my heart trembles for fear they have seen 
us, and heard you speak ; if they have, they will certainly 
murder us all. — Have they any fire-arms ? said I. He 
answered they had only two pieces, one of which they ledl

lee they are all asleep, it is an easy thing to kill them %L ; 
out shall we rather take them prisoners ? He told me the*** 
were two desperate villains among them, that it was scarce 
lafe to show any mercy to; but if thej were secured, he 
believed all the rest would return to their duty. I asked 
him which they were ? He told me he could not at that 
distance distinguish them, but he would obey my orders in 
anything I would direct. Well, says I, let us retreat out ol 
their viev or hearing, l^t they awake, and we will resolve 
further. So they willingly went back with me, till the 
woods covered us from them. 

Look you, sir, said I, if I venture upon your deliverance, 
are you willing to make two conditions with me ? He 
anticipated my proposals, by telling me, that both he and 
the ship, if recovered, should be wholly directed and com- 
manded by me in everything ; and, if the ship was \iOi 
recovered, he would live and die with me in what part of the 
world soever I would send him; and the two other men 
Baid the same. Well, says I, my conditions are but two ; 
first. That while you stay in this island with me, you will 
not pretend to any authority here ; and if I put arm? in 
your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them up to 
me, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this island ; 
and, in the mean time, be governed by my orders : secondly. 
That if the ship is, or may be recovered, you will carry me 
and my man to England passage free. 

He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith 
of man could devise, that he would comply with these most 
reasonable demands ; and, besides, would owe his life to me, 
and acknowledge it upon all occasions, as long as he lived. 
Well then, said F, here are tliree muskets for you, with 
powder and ball : tell me next what you think proper to be 
done. He showed me all the testimonies of his gratitude 
ttiat he was able, but offered to be wholly guided by me. 1

: <t method I could think of was to fire upi n tl em at onc^ 
A . they lay, and if any was not killed at the first volley, and 
ftffered to submit, we might save them, and so put it whollj 
apon God's providence to direct the shot. He said verj 
modestly, that he was loath to kill them, if he could help it , 
*^ut that those two were incorrigible villains, and had been 
ihe authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, 
we should be undone still ; for they would go on board and 
bring the wh:)le ship's company, and destroy us all. Weli 
then, says I, necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the 
only way to save our lives. However, seeing him still cau- 
tious of shedding blood, I told him they should go them- 
selves and manage as they found convenient. 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them 
awake, and soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I 
asked him if either of them were the heads of the mutiny ? 
He said no. Well, then, said I, you may let them escape ; 
and Providence seems to have awakened them on purpose to 
Bi*ve themselves. Now, says I, if the rest escape you, it is 
your fault. Animated with this, he took the musket I had 
given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two 
comrades with him, with each a piece in his hand ; the two 
men who were with him going first, made some noise, at 
which one of the seamen who was awake turned about, and 
seeing them commg, cned out to the rest ; but it was too 
late then, " for the moment he cried out they fired ; I mean 
the two men, the captain wisely reserving his own piece 
They had so well aimed their shot at the men they knc w, 
that one of them was killed on the spot, and the otler veiy 
much wounded ; but not being dead, he started up on his 
feet, and called eagerly for help to the others; but the 
captain stepping to him, told him it was too late to cry for 
nelp, he should call upon God to forgive his villany , and 
vith that word knocked him down with the stock of hii 
ausket, » ) that he nevi^r spoke more ; Uiera were tiuM

more in t le company, and one of them was als h ightly 
wounded. By this time I was come ; and when they saw 
their danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they begged 
for mercy. The captain told them he would spare their lives, 
it' they would give him any assurance of their abhorrence 
of the treachery they had been guilty of, and would STireai 
to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and afterwards in 
ca trying her back to Jamaica, from whence they came. They 
gave him all the protestations of their sincerity that could 
be desired, and he was willing to believe them, and spare 
their lives, which I was not against, only that I obliged 
him to keep them bound hand and foot while they were on 
the island. 

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's 
mate to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring away 
the oars and sails, which they did ; and by and by three 
straggling men, that were (happily for them) parted from the 
rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired, and seeing the 
captain, who before was their prisoner, now their conqueror 
they submitted to be bound also ; and so our victory was 
complete. 

It now remained that the captain and I should inquire 
into one another*s circumstances : I began first, and told him 
my whole history, which he heard with an attention even to 
amazement ; and particularly at the wonderful manner oi 
my being furnished with provisions and ammunition ; and, 
indeed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders, it 
affec>ed him deeply. But when he reflected from thence 
ipon himself, and how I seemed to have been preserved 
'uheie on purpose to save his life, the tears ran down his face, 
and he could not speak a word more. After this communi- 
cation was at an end, I carried him and his two men into my 
apartment, leading them in just where I came out, viz., at 
^.e top of the house, where I refreshed them with sucli 



ROBINSON CRJSOE 281 

(/OTuions as 1 lad, and showed them all the contrivances 
tiad made, during my long, long inhabiting that place. 

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectlj 
amazing ; but, above all, the captain admired my fortification^ 
and how perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove 
of trees, which, having now been planted near twenty years, 
and the trees growing much faster than in England, was 
become a little wood, and so thick, that it was impassable in 
any part of it, but at that one side where I had reserved my 
little winding passage into it. I told him this was my 
castle and my residence, but that I had a seat in the country, 
AS most princes have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, 
and I would show him that too another time ; but at present 
our business was to consider how t% recover the ship. Ho 
agreed with me as to that ; but told me he was perfectly at 
a loss what measures to take, for that there were still six* 
and-twenty hands on board, who having entered into a cursed 
conspiracy, by which they had forfeited their lives to the 
law, would be hardened in it now by desperation, and would 
carry it on, knowing that, if they were subdued, they would 
be brought to the gallows, as soon as they came to England, 
or to any of the English colonies ; and that, therefore, there 
would be no attacking them with so small a number as we were. 

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found 
it was a very rational conclusion, and that, therefore, some- 
ching was to be resolved on speedily, as well to draw the 
men on board into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent 
ihcir landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon this, it 
presently occurred to me, that in a little while the ship's 
3rew, wondering what was become of their comrades, and 
of the boat, would certainly come on shore in their other 
ooat to look for them ; and that then, perhaps, they might 
come armed, and be too strong for us : this he allowed to be 
rational. Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to di 



288 ADVENTURES OF 

wai» to stave the boat, which lay upon tht beach, sc that 
they might not carry her off; and taking everything out o* 
her, leave her so far useless as not to be fit to swim : accord 
ingly we went on board, took the arms which were left on 
board out of her, and whatever else we found there, which 
was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit 
cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a 
piece of canvas (the sugar was five or six pounds) ; all 
which was very welcome to me, especially the brandy and 
Bugar, of which I had none left for many years. 

When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, 
mast, sail and rudder of the boat was carried away before, as 
above), we knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if they 
had come strong enoug^i to master us, yet they could not 
carry ofi* the boat. Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts 
that we could be able to recover the ship ; but my view was 
that if they went away without the boat, I did not much 
question to make her fit again to carry us to the Leeward 
(slands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards in my way ; 
(br I had them still in my thoughts. 

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, 
ay main strength, heaved the boat upon the beach so high, 
that the tide would not float her ofi* at high-water mark, and 
besides, had broke a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly 
fe topped, and were set down musing what we should do, we 
heard the ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft with her 
t;nsign as a signal for the boat to come on board : but no 
boat stirred ; and they fired several times, making other 
lignals for the boat. At last, when all their signals and 
firing proved fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, 
ive saw them, by the help of my glasses, hoist another boat 
)ut, and row towards the shore ; and we found, as the J 
<pproHched, that there were no less than ten men in her, ano 
Jiat they had fire-arms with them. 

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the sliore, w« 



ROBINSON CKUSOB. 28Si 

had a full view of tLem as they came, aud a plain sight 
even of their faces ; because the tide having set them a 
little to the eas* of the other boat, they rowed up under 
shore, to come to the same place where the other had 
landed, and where the boat lay ; by this means, I say, -we 
Lid a f/.I view of them, and the captain knew the persons 
and r^aracters of all the men in the boat, of whom, he said, 
there were three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, 
V5 sre led into this conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered 
and frightened; but that as for the boatswain, who, it 
seems, was the chief officer among them, and all the rest, 
they were as outrageous as any of the ships's crew, and 
were no doub*. made desperate in their new enterprise ; and 
terribly apprehensive he was that they would be too power- 
ful for us. I smiled at him, and told him that men in our 
circumstances were past the operation of fear ; that seeing 
almost every condition that could be was better than that 
which we were supposed to be in, we ought to expect 
that the consequence, whether death or life, would be sure 
to be a deliverance. I asked him what he thought of tAe 
circumstances of my life, and whether a deliverance were 
not worth venturing for ? And where, sir, said I, is your 
belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your 
life, which elevated you a little while ago; for my part, 
said I, there seems to me but one thing amiss in all the 
prospect of it. What is that? says he. Why, says I, 
jt is, that as you say there are three or four honest fellows 
among them, which should be spared, had they been all of 
the wicked part of the crew, I should have thought CJod's 
I rovidence had singled them out to deliver them into your 
hands; fur, depend upon it, every man that comes ashore 
are our own, and shall die or live as they behave to us. A» 
I spoke this with a raised voice and choerfal countenance, I 
found it greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to 
9ur business.

iOO ADVENTUKiiS OF 

We had, upon the first appearance of the boat'a (oming 
trom the ship, considered of separating our prisoners; and 
we had, indeed, secured them effectually. Two of them, 
of ;¥hom the captain was less assured than ordinary, I sent 
with Friday, and one of the chree delivered men, to my 
jave, where Ihey were remote enough, and out of danger oJ 
being heard or discovered, or of finding their way out ol 
\\e woods if they could have delivered themselves : here 
.hey left them hound, but gave them provisions; and 
promised them if they continued there quietly, to give them 
their liberty in a day or two : but that if they attempted 
their escape, they should be put to death without mercy. 
They promised faithfully to bear their confinement with 
patience, and were very thankful that they had such good 
Ullage as to have provisions and light left them ; for Friday 
gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for their 
jomfort ; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel 
over them at the entrance. 

The other prisoners had better usage : two of them were 
kept pinioned, indeed, because the captain was not free to 
*,ru8t them ; but the other two were taken into my service, 
upon the captain's recommendation, and upon their solemnly 
engaging to live and die with us ; so with them and the 
three honest men we were seven men well armed ; and 1 
made no doubt we should be able to deal well enough with 
the ten that were coming, considering that the captain had 
said that there weie three or four honest men among them 
ilso. As soon as they got to the place where their other 
iioat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and came on 
shore, hauling the boat up after them, which I was glad to see ; 
for I was afraid they would rather have left the boat at an 
anchor, some distance from the shore, with some hands in 
her to guard her, and so we should not be able to seize th* 
boat. Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran aU 
to their other boat ; and it was easy to see they were unJei 



10BINS0N CRUSOE. 2^ 

t great surprise to find her stripped, as above, of all thai 
was in her, and a great hole in her bottom. After they had 
mused awhile upon this, they set up two or three great 
shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try if they could 
make their companions hear ; but all was to no purpose : 
•len they came all closein a ring, and fired a volley of theii 
small arms, which indeed, we heard, and the echoes made 
the woods ring ; but it was all one : those in the cave wo 
we were sure could not hear; and those in our keeping, 
though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no answer 
to th^m. They were so astonished at the surprise of this, 
that, as they told afterwards, they resolved to go all on 
board again to their ship, and let them know that the men 
were all murdered, and the long-boat staved ; accordingly, 
they immediately launched their boat again, and got all of 
them on board. 

The captain was terribly amazed and even confounded at 
this, believing they would go on board the ship agajn, and 
set sail, giving their con^ades over for lost, and so he should 
still lose the ship, which he was in hopes we should have 
recovered ; but he was quickly as much frightened the 
other way. 

They had not been long put off with the boat, but we 
perceived them all coming on shore again; but with this 
new measure in their conduct, which*it seems they consulted 
together upon, viz., to leave three men in the boat, and the 
rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to look for 
(heir fellows. This was a great disappointmeni <o us, foi 
now we were at a loss what to do ; as our seizing? those 
seven men on shore would be no advantage to us, ii we let 
the boat escape ; because they would then row awa} to the 
ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and 
tfct sail, and so our recovering the ship would be losr 
However, we had no remedy but to wait and see what 
the isiue of things might present. The seven men came on 



192 * ADVENTUUES OF 

•hore, and the three who remained in the hoat put her C/ff t« 
.a good distance from tho shore, and came to an anchor to 
Urait for them ; so that it was impossible for us to come at 
them in the boat. Those that came on shore kept close 
together, maiching towards the top of the little hill undei 
which my habitation lay ; and we could see them plainly, 
though they could not perceive us. We could have been 
very glad they would have come nearer to us, so that we 
might have fired at them, or that they would have gone 
farther off, that we might have come abroad. But when 
they were come to the brow of the hill, where they could 
8ee a great way into the valleys and woods, which lay 
towaids the north-east part, and where the island lay lowest, 
they shouted and hallooed till they were weary; and not 
carin^j, it seems, to venture far from the shore, nor far from 
one another, they sat down together under a tree, to consider 
of it. Had they tnought fit to have gone to sleep there, as 
the oth^r part of tdem had done, they had done the job for 
us; but they were too full of apprehensions of danger to 
venture to go to s'«eep, though they could not tell what the 
danger was they had to fear neither. 

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this 
consultation of i heirs, viz., that perhaps they would all fire 
a volley again, lo endeavor to make their fellows hear, and 
that we should all salfy upon them, just at the juncture 
when their pieces were all discharged, and they would 
certainly yield, and we should have them without bloodshed, 
I liked this proposal, provided it was done while we were 
near enough to come up to them before they could load 
theii piecos again ; but this even did not happen ; and we 
*jiy still a long time, very irresolute what course to take. 
At length I told them that there would be nothing done, in 
my opinion, till night; and then, if they did not return to 
the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get between them 
4iid the sb Te, and so might use some stratagem with tl eiv 



ROBINSON CIIUSOK. 2^ 

*ii h» boat to get them on shore. We waited a grea 
while, though very impatient for their removing ; and were 
Tery uneasy, when, after long consultations, we saw them 
all start up and march down towards the sea ; it seems they 
had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the danger 
of the place, that they resolved to go on board the ship 
again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on 
with their intended voyage with the ship. 

As soon as I perceived them to go towards the shore, I 
imagined it to be, as it really was, that they had given over 
their search, and were for going back again ; and the 
captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to 
sink at the apprehensions of it : but I presently thought oi 
a stratagem to fetch them back again, and which answered 
my end to a title. I ordered Friday and the captain's mate 
to go over the little creek westward, towards the place where 
the savages came on shore when Friday was resciied, and as 
they came to a little rising ground, at about a half mile 
distance, I bade them halloo out, as loud as they could, 
and wait till they found the seamen heard them ; that as 
soon as they heard the seamen answer them, they should 
return it again; and then keeping out of sight, take a 
round, always answering when the others hallooed, to draw 
them as far into the island, and among the woods, as 
possible, and then wheel about again to me, by such ways 
as I directed them. 

They were just going into the boat when Friday and 
the mate hallooed: and they presently heard them, and 
answering, run along the shore westward, towards the 
voice they heard, when they were presently stopped by the 
tieek, where the water being up, they could nc get ovei 
and called for the boat to come up and set them over ; as, 
indeed, I expected. When they had set themselves over, I 
observed that the boat being gone a good way into tht 
creek, and, as it were, in a harbor within the land, thej 
25* 



194 ADVENTURES OF 

took one of tie three men out of her, to go along witL theia 
and left only two in the boat, having fastened her to thf 
itump of a little tree on the shore. This was what I wished 
.or ; and immediately leaving Friday and the captain's mate 
to their business, I took the rest with me, and crossing the 
creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men befor« 
they were aware ; one of 'them lying on the shore, and the 
other being in the boat. The fellow on shore was between 
sleeping and waking, and going to start up; the captain, 
who was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked him 
down ; and then called out to him in the boat to yield, or 
he was a dead man. There needed very few arguments to 
persuade a single man to jdeld, when he saw five men upon 
him, and his comrade knocked down ; besides, this was, it 
seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in the 
mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore, was easily 
persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to join very 
sincerely with us. In the mean time, Friday and the 
captain's mate so well managed their business with the rest^ 
that they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from one 
hill to another, and from one wood to another, till they not 
only heartily tired them, but left them where they were very 
sure they could not reach back to the boat before it wai 
dark ; and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves also, 
by the time they came back to us. 

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in 
the dark, and to &11 upon them, so as to make sura wc rk 
with them. It was several hoiirs after Friday came back to 
me before they came back to their boat ; and we could hear 
the foremost of them, long before they came quite up, calling 
to those behind to come along ; and could also hear them 
Answer, and complain how lame and tired they were, and 
not able to come any faster, which was very welcome newi 
to us. At length they came up to the boat; but it u 
haposiible to express their confusion when they found tht 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 29« 

boat fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed oui, and theL 
two men gone. We could hear them call to one another m 
a most lamentable manner, telling one another they were 
got into an enchanted island : that either there were inhab- 
itants in it, and they should all be murdered, or else there 
were devils and spirits in it, and they should be all carried 
tway and devoured. They hallooed again, and called theii 
two comrades by their names a great many times ; but no 
answer. After some time, we could see them, by the little 
light there was, run about, wringing their hands like men in 
despair ; and that sometimes they would go and sit down in 
the boat, to rest themselves ; then come ashore again, and 
walk about again, and so the same thing over again. My 
men would fein have had me give them leave to fall upon 
them at once in the dark ; but I was willing to take them 
at some advantage, so to spare them, and kill as few of 
them as I could ; and especially I was unwilling to hazard 
the killing any of our men, knowing the others were very 
well armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not sepa- 
rate ; and, therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my 
ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to 
creep upon their hands and feet, as close to the ground as 
they could, that they might not Ue discovered, and get as 
near them as they could possibly, before they offered to fire. 
They had not been long in that posture, when the boat- 
swain, who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and 
had now shown himself the most dejected and dispirited oi 
all the rest, came walking towards them, with two more o! 
the crew : the captain was so eager at having this principal 
rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have 
patience to let him come so near as to be sure of him, for 
they only heard his tongue before : but when they came 
nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on their feet, le* 
€y at thjm. The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the 
lieit man was shot in the body, and fell just by him, though 



296 ADVENTURES Oi^ 

he did not die Uil an hour or two after ; and the third i&b 
for it. At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced 
with my whole army, which was now eight men, viz., myself, 
generalissimo ; Friday, my lieutenant-general ; the captain 
and his two men, and the three prisoners of war, whom we 
had trusted with arms. We came upon them, indeed, in 
the dark, so that they could not see our number; and 1 
made the man they had left in the boat, who was now one 
of us, to call them by name, to try if I could bring them to 
a parley, and so might perhaps reduce them to terms ; which 
fell out just as we desired : for, indeed, it was easy to think, 
as their condition then was, they would be willing to capitu- 
late. So he clklls out, as loud as he could, to one of them, 
Tom Smith ! Tom Smith ! Tom Smith answered immedi- 
ately, Is that Robinson ? For it seems, he knew the voice 
The other answered. Ay, ay ; for God's sake, Tom Smith, 
throw doMm your arms and yield, or you are all dead men this 
moment. — Who must we yield to ? Where are they ? says 
Smith again. Here they are, says he ; here's our captain 
and fifty men with him, have been hunting you these two 
hours : the boatswain is killed. Will Fry is wounded, and I 
am a prisoner ; and if you do not yield, you are all lost. — 
Will they give us quarte/ then ? says Tom Smith, and we 
will yield. — I will go ask, if you promise to yield, says 
Robinson : so he asked the captain ; and the captain himsell 
then calls out. You, Smith, you know my vcice ; if you lay

LBAVB8 THB ISLAND. 

Upon this Will Atkins cried out, For God's sake, captain, 
give me quarter ; what have I done ? They have all been 
M bad as I : which, by the way, was not true neither ; for, 
it seems, this Will Atkins was the first man that laid hold 
of the captain when they first mutinied, and used him bar- 
barously, in tying his hands, and giving him injurious 
language. However, the captain told him he must lay 
down his arms at discretion, and trust to the governor's 
mercy : by which he meant me, for they all called me 
governor. In a word, they all laid down their arms, and 
begged their lives ; and I sent the man that had parlied 
with them, and two more, who bound them all ; and then 
my great army of fifty men, which particularly with those 
three, were in all but eight, came up and seized upon them, 
and upon their boat ; only that I kept mys«-lf and one more 
out of sight for reasons of state. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, ami think of seizing 
the ship : and as for the captain, now he hoA leisure to par- 
ley with them, he expostulated with them upon the villany 
of their practices with him, and at length ufton the furthei 
wickedness of their design, and how certainly it must brinj: 
ihem to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps t(» tfxC 
gallows. They all appeared very penitent, and beg<?ed haid 
for their lives. As for that, he told them they were none 
of his prisoners, but the commander's of the island ; that 
they thought they had set him on shore on a barren,* unia- 
Kacitcd rsland ; but it had pleased God «o to direct them.

that it was inhabited, and that the governoi was an English* 
man ; that he might hang thera all there, if he pleased ; but 
as he had given them all quarter, he supposed he would 
Bond them to EHgland, to be dealt with there as justice 
required, except Atkins, whom he was commanded by the 
governor to advise to prepare for death, for that he would be 
hanged in the morning. 

Though all this was but a fiction of his own, yet It had 
its desired effect : Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the 
eaptain to intercede with the governor for his life ; and all 
the rest begged of him, for God*s sake, that they might not 
be sent to England. 

It now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance 
was come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring 
these fellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the 
ship ; so I retired in the dark from them, that they might 
not see what kind of a governor they had, and called the 
captain to me ; when I called, as at a good distance, one of 
the men was ordered to speak again, and say to the captain. 
Captain, the commander calls for you ; and presently the 
captain replied. Tell his excellency I am just a-coming. 
This more perfectly amused them, and they all believed that 
the commander was just by with his fifty men. Upon the 
captain's coming to me, I told him my project for seizing 
the ship, which he liked wonderfully well, and resolved to 
put it in execution the next morning. But, in order to 
execute it with more heart, and to be secure of success, I 
told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he should 
go and take Atkins and two more of the worst of them, and 
•end them pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This 
was committed to Friday and the two men who came on 
shore with the captain. They conveyed them to the cave ai 
to a prison: and it was, indeed, a dismal place, especially tc 
men ip their l^ndition. The others I ordered *o my hower 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 209 

M I called it, of which I have given a full descripticu ; and 
as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was secure 
enough, considering they were upon their behavior. 

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to 
enter into a parley with them ; in a word, to try them, a ad 
tell me whether he thought they might be trusted or no to 
go on board and surprise the ship. He talked to them ol 
the injury done him, of the condition they were brought to, 
and that though the governor had given them quarter foi 
their lives as to the present action, yet that if they were sent 
10 England, they would all be hanged in chains, to be sure ; 
but that if they would join in so just an attempt as to recover 
the ship, he would have the governor's engagement for their 
pardon. 

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be 
accepted by men in their condition ; they fell down on their 
knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest impre- 
cations, that they would be faithful to him to the last drop, 
and that they should owe their lives to him, and would go 
with him all over the world ; that they would own him as a 
father as long as they lived. Well, says the captain, I must 
go and tell the governor what you say, and see what I can 
do to bring him to consent to it. So he brought me an 
account of the temper he found them in, and that he verily 
believed they would be faithful. However, that we might be 
very secure, I told him he should go back again and choose 
out those five, and tell them, that they might see he did not 
want men, that he would take out those five to. be hin 
assistants, and that the governor would keep the other two, 
and the three that were sent prisoners to the castle (my 
cave) as hostages for the fidelity of those five ; and that il 
they proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hostagct 
should be hanged in chains alive on the shore. This looked 
•ovete. f nd convinced theni that the governor wag in eariieef 



too ADVENTURES Of 

however, they had no way left them but to accept it ; and it 
was now the business of the prisoners, as much as of thi 
captain, to persuade the other five to do their duty. 

Oar strength was now thus ordered for the expedition : 
first, the captain, hb mate, and passenger ; second, the two 
prisoners of the first gang, to whom, having their charactei 
firom the captain, I had given their liberty, and trusted them 
with arms : third, the other two that I had kept till now in 
my bower pinioned, but, on the captain's motion, had now 
released : fourth, these five released at last ; so that they 
were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the cave 
for hostages. 

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with 
these hands on boeird the ship : but as for me and my man 
Friday, I did not think it was proper for us to stir, having 
leven men left behind ; and it was employment enough for 
us to keep them asunder, and supply them with victuals. 
As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but 
Friday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with 
necessaries ; and I made the other two carry provisions to a 
certain distance, where Friday was to take it. 

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with 
the captain, who told them I was the person the govemot 
had ordered to look after them ; and that it was the gover- 
nor*s pleasure they should not stir any where but by my 
direction ; that if they did, they would be fetched into th« 
sastle, and be laid in irons : so that as we never suffered 
them to .see me as a governor, I now appeared as another 
person, and spoke of the governor, the garrison, the castle, 
and the like, upon all occasions. 

The captain now had no difficulty before him, but to 
furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them. 
He made his passenger captain of one, wi*h four of the men , 
and hunself, his mate, and five more, went in the other : an<)

they had brought off the men and the boat, but that it waa 
A long time before they had found them, and the like, hold* 
mg them in a chat till they came to the ship's side ; when the 
captain and the mate entering first, with their arms, ira- 
mediately knocked down the second mate and carpenter with 
the buttend of their muskets, being very faithfully seconded 
by their men ; they secured all the rest that were upon the 
main and quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches, to 
keep them dowi^ that were below ; when the other boat and 
their men entering at the fore-chains, secured the forecastle 
of the ship, and the scuttle which went down into the cock- 
room, making three men they found there prisoners. When 
this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain ordered 
the mate, with three men, to break into the round-house, 
where the new rebel captain lay, who having taken the 
iJarm, had got up, and with two men and a boy had got fire 
arms in their hands ; and when the mate, with a crow, split 
open the door, the new captain and his men fired boldly 
among them, and wounded the mate with a musket ball, 
which broke his arm, and wounded two more of the men, 
but killed nobody. The mate, calling for help, rushed, 
however, into the round-house, wounded as he was, and 
with his pistol shot the new captain through the head, the 
bullet entering at his mouth, and came out again behind 
one of his ears, so that he never spoke a word more : upon 
which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken effectually, 
without any more lives lost. 

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered 
•even guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon 
with me to give me notice of his success, which you 'may be 
•ure 1 was very glad to hear, having sat watching upon the 
■hore for it till near two o*clock in the morning. Hanng 
ibuf heard the i^ignal plainly, I laid me down : and it having

been a day of great fatigue to me, 1 slept very sound. tiL* t 
was something surprised at the noise of a gun ; and presently 
starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of Governor, 
Governor, and presently 1 knew the captain's voice ; when 
climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and point- 
ing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms. My dear 
friend and deliverer, says he, there's your ship, for she is all 
yours, and so are we, and all that belong to her. I cast ray 
eyeji to the ship, and there she rode within little more than 
Lalf a mile of the shore ; for they had weighed her anchor 
b.a soon as they were masters of her, and the weather being 
fair, had brought her to anchor just against the mouth oi 
the little creek ; and the tide being up, the captain had 
brought the pinnace in near the place where I at first 
landed my rafts, and so landed just at my door. I was at 
first ready to sink down with the surprise ; for I saw my 
deliverance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things 
easy, and a large ship just ready to carry me away wliither ] 
pleased to go. At first, for some time, I was not able to 
answer him one word ; but as he had taken me in his arms, 
I held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the ground. 
He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulls a bottle 
Dut of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which he 
had brought on purpose for me. After 1 had drank it, I &at 
down upon the ground ; and though it brought me to myself, 
yet it was a good while before 1 could speak a word to him. 
All this time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, 
only not under any surprise, as I was ; and he said a 
thousand kind and tender things to me, to compose and 
bring me to myself; but such was the flood of joy in my 
breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion ; at last ii 
broke out into tears ; and in a little while after I recovered 
my speech. I then took my turn, and embraced him as m% 
deliverer, and we rejoiced together. I told him I iook&.

«pon k^m as a man sent from Heaven to delivei mes and 
that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders ; 
that- such things as these were the testimonies we had of a 
Becret hand of Providence governing the world, and an 
evidence that the eye of an infinite power could search int^ 
the remotest comer of the world, and send help to the mi«- 
erable yrhenever he pleased. I forgot not to lift up my heart 
in thankfulness to Heaven : and what heart could forbear to 
bless him, who had not only in a miraculous manner provided 
for me in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, 
but from whom every deliverance must always be acknowl- 
edged to proceed ? 

When we had talked a while, the captain told me he had 
brought me some little refreshment, such as the ship afforded, 
and such as the wretches that had been so long his masters 
had not plundered him of. Upon this he called aloud to the 
boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore that were for 
the governor ; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had been 
one that was not to be carried away with them, but as if I 
had been to dwell upon the island still. First, he had 
brought me a case of bottles full of excellent cordial waters, 
six large bottles of Maderia wine (the bottles held two 
quarts each), two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve 
good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a 
bag of peas, and about a hundred weight of biscuit : he also 
brought me a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full ol 
lemons, and two bottles of lime juice, and abundance ol 
other things. But, besides these, and what was a thousand 
times more useful to me, he brought me six new clean shirts, 
six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair ol 
vhoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very good 
•uit of clothes of his own, which had been worn but very 
little ; in a word, he clothed me from head to foot. It wai

to one in my ciiciunstanccs ; but never was anyth ng in thi 
world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and aneasy, aji 
it was to me to wear such clothes at first. 

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good 
things were brought into my little apartment, we began to 
consult, what was to be done with the prisoners we had ; foi 
it was worth considering whether we might venture to take 
them away with us or no, ^specially two of them, whom we 
knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree ; 
and the captain said he knew they were such rogues, that 
there was no obliging them ; and if he did carry them away, 
it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to 
justice at the first English colony he could come at ; and 1 
found that the captain himself was very anxious about it. 
Upon this I told him, that if he desired it, I would under- 
take to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own 
request that he should leave them upon the island. I should 
be very glad of that, says the captain, with all my heart. — 
Well, says I, I will send for them up, and talk with them 
for you. So I caused Friday and the two hostages, for they 
were now discharged, their comrades having performed their 
promise ; I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring 
up the five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and 
keep them there till I came. After some time^I came thithei 
dressed in my new habit ; and now I was called governor 
again. Being all met, and the captain mth me, I caused 
the men to be brought before me, and I told them I had got 
a full account of their villainous behavior to the captain, 
and how they had run away with the ship, and were pre- 
paring to commit farther robberies, but that Providence had 
ensnared them in their own ways, and that they were fallen 
into the pit which they had dug for others. I let them know 
that by my direction the ship had been seized : that she lay 
now in the road ; and they might see, by and by, that the it 
captain ha»l received the reward of his villainy, and thjw 



KOBINSON CKUSOE. 305 

Chey would see him hanging at the yard-arm : that as Iq 
them, I wanted to know what they liad to say why I should 
' not execute them as pirates, taken in the fact, as hy my 
commission they could not doubt but I had authority so to 
io. 

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that thej 
had nothing to say but this, that when they were taken, the 
captain promised them their lives, and they humbly implored 
my mercy. But I told them I knew not what mercy to 
show them : for as for myself, I had resolved to quit the 
island with all my men, and had taken passage with thp 
Captain to go for England ; and as for the captain, he could 
not carry them to England other than as prisoners, in iions, 
to be tried for mutiny, and running away with the ship ; the 
'Consequence of which, they must needs know, would be the 
gallows ; so that I could not tell what was best for them, 
unless they had a mind to take their fate in the island ; 
if they desired that, as I had liberty to leave the island, 
I had some inclination to give them their lives, if they 
thought they could shift on shore. They seemed very 
thankful for it, and said they would much rather venture to 
stay there than to be carried to England to be hanged : so 1 
left it on that issue. 

However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty o* 
it, as if he durst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed 
a little angry with the captain, and told him that they were 
my prisoners, not his ; and seeing that I had offered them n 
much favor, I would be as good as my word : and that if h#» 
did not think fit to consent to it, I would set them at 
liberty, as I found them ; and if he did not like it, he might 
take them again if he could catch them. Upon this they 
appeared very thankful, and I accordingly set them at liberty, 
and bade them retire into the woods from whence they came, 
and I would leave them some fire-arms, some ammunition, 
and some direc tions how they should live very well, if thej 
26* 



)06 ADVENIJRES OF 

thought fit. Upon this I prepared to go on board tie snip ,* 
but told the captain I would stay that night to prepare mj 
things, and desired him to go on board, in the mean time, 
and keep all right in the ship, and send the boat on shore 
next day fos me ; ordering him, at all events, to cause the 
new captain, who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, 
that these men might see him. 

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to mo 
to my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with 
them on their circumstances. I told them I thought they 
had made a right choice ; that if the captain had carried 
them away, they would certiiinly be hanged. I showed them 
the new captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and 
told them they had nothing less to expect. 

When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I 
then told them I would let them into the story of my living 
there, and put them into the way of making it easy to them ; 
accordingly, I gave them the whole history of the place, and 
of my coming to it ; showed them my fortifications, the -way 
I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes ; and, 
in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I told 
them the story also of the seventeen Spaniards that were to 
'je expected, for whom 1 left a letter, and made them promise 
X) treat them in common with themselves. Here it may be 
noted, that the captain had ink on board, who was greatly 
surprised that I never hit upon a way of making ink of 
charcoal and water, or of something else, as I had done 
things much more difficult. 

I left them my fire-arms, viz., five muskets, three fowling- 
pieces, and three swords. I had above a barrel and a hall 
of powder left ; for after the first year or two I used but 
little, and wasted none. I gave them a description of the 
way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and fatten 
them, and to make both butter and cheese : in a word, I 
gave them everv part of my own •story, and told them f 



UOIUNSON CRUSOK. 307 

j]:jul(l prevail with the captain to leave them two liarrels ol 
gunpowder more, and some garden seeds, which I told them 
I would have been very glad of: also I gave them the bag 
of peas which the captain had brought me to eat, and bade 
them be sure to sow and increase them. 

Having done all this, I left them the next day, 4nd went 
on board the ship. We prepared immediately to sail, but 
did not weigh that night. The next morning early, two of 
the five men came swimming to the ship's side, and making 
a most lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to 
be taken into the ship, for God's sake, for they should be 
murdered, and begged the captain to take them on board, 
though he hanged them immediately. Upon this, the captain 
pretended to have no power without me ; but after some 
difRcul'ty, and after their solemn promises of amendment, 
they were taken on board, and were some time after soundly 
whipped and pickled ; after which they proved very honest 
and quiet fellows. 

Some time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the 
tide being up, with the things promised to the men ; to 
which the captain, at my intercession, caused their chests 
and clothes to be added, which they took, and were very 
thankftd for. I also encouraged them, by telling them that 
if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them in, I 
would not forget them. 

When 1 took leave of this island, I carried on board, for 
reliques, the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella. 
and one of my parrots ; also I forgot not to take the money 
I formerly mentioned, which had laid by me so long useless, 
that^t was grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly pass 
for silver, till it had been a little rubbed and handled ; as 
also the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship 
And thus I left the island, the 19th of December, as I found 
by the ship's account, in the year 1686, after I had been 
s^on it eight-and-twenty years, two months, <ind nineteei

B&ASILS — SBT8 OUT ON HIS RETURN TO BNOLAND BT LAND. 

When I came to England, I was as perfect a stranger to all 
the world as if I had never been known there. My bene- 
factor and faithful steward, whom I had left my money in 
trust with, was alive, but had had great misfortunes in the 
world ; was become a widow the second time, and very low 
in the world. I made her very easy as to what she owed 
me, assuring her I would give her no trouble ; but on the 
contrary, in gratitude for former care and faithfulness to me, 
I relieved her as my little stock would afford ; which, at 
that time, would indeed allow me to do but little for her ; 
but I assured her I would never forget her- former kindness 
to me ; nor did I forget her when I had sufiScient to help 
her, as shall be observed in its proper place. I went down 
afterwards into Yorkshire ; but my father and mother we/e 
dead, and all the family extinct, except that I found two 
sisters, and two of the children of one of my brothers ; and 
as I had been long ago given over for dead, there had been 
no provision made for me : so that, in a word, I found 
nothing to relieve or assist me ; and that the little money ) 
had would not do much for me as to settling in the woild. 



ROBINSOIS CRUSOE. 5 n 

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not 
fxpect ; and this was, that the master of the shij^ whom 1 
had so happily delivered, and by the same means saved the 
•hip and cargo, having given a very handsome account to 
the owners of the manner how I had saved the lives of the 
men, and the ship, they invited me to meet them, and some 
other merchants concerned, and all together made me a very 
Handsome compliment upon the subject, and a present 01 
almost two hundred pounds sterling. 

But after making several reflections upon the circumstances 
of my life, and how little way tnis would go towards set- 
tling me in the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and see il 
I might not come by some information of the state of my 
plantation in the Brazils, and of what was become of my 
partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some years past 
given me over for dead. With this view I took shipping for 
Lisbon, where I arrived in April following ; my man Friday 
accompanying me very honestly in all these ramblings, and 
proving a most faithful servant upon all occasions. When I 
came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and to my particu- 
lar satisfaction, my old friend the captain of the ship who 
first took me up at sea off the shore of Africa. He was 
now grown old, and had left off going to sea, having put his 
•on, who was far from a young man, into his ship, and who 
atill used the Brazil trade. The old man did not know me ; 
and, indeed, I hardly knew him ; but I soon brought him to 
my remembrance, and as soon brought myself to his remem^ 
tjrance, when I told him who I was. 

After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance 
i etween us, I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation 
and my partner. The old man told me he had not been in 
tk e Brazils for about nine years ; but that he could assure 
me that when he came away my partner was living ; but tht 
trustees, vhom I had joined with him to take cognizance 9t 
«iy p^t ^ere both dead : that, however, he believed 1 



510 ADVENTURES OF 

would have a very good account of the impro\iment t£ tht 
plantation ; for that upon the general belief of my being 
cast away and drowned, my trustees had given in the account 
of the produce of my part of the plantation to the procurator- 
fiscal, who had appropriated it, in case I never came to claim 
It, one-third to the king, and two- thirds to the monasteiy oi 
St. Augustine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, 
and for the conversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith ; 
but that if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the 
inheritance, it would be restored ; only that the improve- 
ment, or annual production, being distributed to charitable 
uses, could not be restored : but he assured me that the 
steward of the king's revenue from lands, and the proviedore, 
or steward of the monastery, had taken great care all along 
that the incumbent, that is to say, my partner, gave every 
yea? a faithful account of the produce, of which they had 
duly received my moiety. I asked him if he knew to what 
height of improvement he had brought the plantation, and 
whether he thought it might be worth looking after ; or 
whether, on my going thither, I should meet with any 
obstruction to my possessing my juSt right in the moiety. 
He told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the 
plantation was improved, but this he knew, that my partner 
was grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying his part of it ; 
atul that, to the best of his remembrance, he had heard that 
the kinj^'s third of my part, which was, it seems, granted 
iway to some other monastery or religious house, amounted 
to above two hundred moidoros a-year : that as to my being 
restored to a quiet possession of it, there was no question to 
)0 made of that, my part ler being alive to witness my title, 
md my name being also enrolled in the register of tJie 
ountry : also he told me, that the survivors of my two 
irustees were very fair honest people, and very wealthy ; 
knd ha believed I \NOuld not only have their assistance foi 
. utting me in possession, hut would find a very considexablf 



nOBINSON CHUSOE. Jlj 

of money in their hands for my account, being th» 
produce of the farm while their fathers held the tiust, and 
before it was given up, as above ; which, as he remembered, 
was fur about twelve years. 

I showei myself a little concerned and uneasy at thif 
account, and inquired of the old captain how it came to past 
that the trustees should thus dispose of my effects, when he 
knew that I had made my will, and had made him, the 
Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c. 

He told me that was true ; but that as there was no proof 
of my being dead he could not act as executor, until some 
certain account should come of my death ; and, besides, he 
was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote : that 
it was true he had registered my will, and put in his claim ; 
add could he have given any account of my being dead or 
alive, he would have acted by procuration, and taken posses- 
sion of the ingenio (so they called the sugar-house), anJ 
have given his son, who was now at the Brazils, orders to 
do it. But, says the old man, I have one piece of news to 
tell you, which, perhaps, may not be so acceptable to you as 
the rest ; and that is, believing you were lost, and all the 
world believing so also, your partner and trustees did offer 
to account with me, in your name, for six or eight of the 
first years' profits, which I received. There being at thai 
time great disbursements for increasing the works, building 
an ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to near so 
much as afterwards it produced : however, says the old man, 
I shall give you a true account of what I have received is 
all, and how I have disposed of it. 

After a few days* further conference with this ancient 
fi'ieud, he brought me an account of the first six years* in* 
eome of plantation, signed by my partner and the merchant 
trustees, being always delivered in goods, viz., tobacco in 
roll, and sugar in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c., which 
'• the (i nsequence of a sugar-work ; and I found, by thit 



512 ADVENTURES OF 

account, that every year the income considerably inci eased ^ 
but, as above, the disbursements being large, the sum at 
first was small : however, the old man let me see that he 
was debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores oi 
gold, besides sixty chests of sugar, and fifteen double rolls 
of tobacco, which were lost in his ship ; he having L<^en 
shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years 
after my leaving the place. The good man then began to 
complain of his misfortunes ; and how he had been obliged 
to make use of my money to recover his losses, and buy 
liim a share in a new ship. However, my old fidend, says 
he, you shall not want a supply in your necessity ; and as 
soon as my son returns, you shall be fully satisfied. Upon 
this, he pulls out an old pouch and gives me one hundred 
and sixty Portugal moidores in gold ; and giving the 
writings of his title to the ship, which his son was gone to 
the Brazils in, of which he was a quarter part owner, and 
his son, another, he puts them both into my hands, for 
security of the rest. 

I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of 
the poor man to be able to bear this ; and remembering whaC 
he had done for me, how he had taken me up at sea, and 
how generously he had used me on all occasions, and 
particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me, 1 could 
"hardly refrain weeping at what he had said to me ; therefore 
I asked him if his circumstances admitted him to spare so 
much money at that time, and if it would not stiaiter 
him ? He told me he could not say but it might straiten him 
a liltle ; but, however, it was my money, and I might want 
it more than he. 

Everything the good man said was full of affection, and 1 
could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke ; in short, I 
took one hundred of the moidores, and called ^or a pen 
and ink to give him a receipt for them : then I returned him 
the r?8t, and told him if ever I had possession of tht 



ItOJJINSON CRUSOE. 3^ 

iMiintation, 1 would return the other to him also (as, indeed 
I afterwards did^; and that as to the bill of sale of hii» 
part in his son's ship, I would not take it by any mean» • 
but that if I wanted the money, I found he was honosf 
enough to pay me; and if I did not, but came to receive 
what he gave me reason to expect, I would never have h 
peimy more from him. 

When this was past, the old man asked me if he shouH 
}Mit me into a method to make my claim to my plantation ? 
I tt»ld him I thought to go over to it myself. He said 1 
might do so, if I pleased ; but that if I did not, there were 
ways enDugh to secure my right, and immediately to appro 
priate the profits to my use : and as there were ships in the 
river of Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made 
me enter my name in a public register, with his affidavit, 
affirming, upon oath, that I was alive, and that I was the 
same person who took up the land for the planting the said 
plantation at first. This being regularly attested by a 
notary, and a procuration a,flixed, he directed me to send it, 
with a letter of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaint- 
ance at the place ; and then proposed mjf staying with him 
till an account came of the return. 

Never was anything more honorable than the proceedings 
upon this procuration; for in less than seven months I 
received a large packet from the survivors of my trustees, 
the merchants, for whose account I went to sea, in which 
were the following particular letters and papers enclosed. 

First, There was the account-current of the produce of 
my farm or plantation, from the year when their fathers had 
balanced with my old Portugal captain, being for six years : 
:Jic balance appeared to be one thousand one hundred and 
geventy-four moidores in my favor. 

Secondly, lliere was the account of four years more, 
while they kept the effects in their hands, before the govern- 
tr^ent claimf 1 the administration, as being the effects o« a 



114 ABVKNTURES OF 

oerpon not to be found, which they called civil death ; and 
the balance of this, the value of the plantation increasing, 
imouuted to nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-«ix 
srusadoes, being about three thousand two hundred and 
forty moidores. 

Thirdly, There was the prior of Augustine's uccount, who 
had received the profits for above fourteen years; but not 
being to account for what was disposed of by the hospital, 
very honestly declared he had eight hundred and seventy- 
two moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged to my 
account : as to the king's part, that refunded nothing. 

Thore was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me 
very affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an 
account how the estate was improved, and what it pioduccd 
a year: with a particular of the number of squares o* 
acres that it contained, how planted, how many slaves there 
were upon it, and making two and twenty crosses for 
blessings, told me he had said so many Ave Marias to 
thank the blessed Virgin that I 'was alive ; inviting me very 
passionately to come over and take possession of my own ; 
and, in the mean time, to give him orders to whom he 
should deliver my effects, if I did not come myself; con- 
cluding with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that of 
his family ; and sent me, as a present, seven fine leopai Is' 
skins, which he had, it seems, received from Africa, by some 
other ship that he had sent thither, and who, it seems, had 
made a better voyage than I, He sent me also five chestt 
•)f excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of gold 
uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. By the same 
fleet, my two merchant trustees shipped me one thousand 
rwo hundred chests of sugar, eight hundred rolls of tobacco, 
and the rest of the whole account m gold. 

1 might well say now, indeed, that the latter ead of Job 
was better than the beginning. It is impossible to expresi 
the flutterings of my very heart, when I found all my wealth 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^\l 

about me; foi as the Brazil ships come all in liefts, the 
lame ships which brought my letters brought my goods* 
and the effects were safe in the river before the letters came 
to my hand. In a w )rd, I turned pale and grew sick ; and 
had not the old man run and fetched me a cordial, I believe 
the sudden surprise of joy had overset nature, and I had 
died upon the spot : nay, after that, I continued very ill 
and was so some hours, till a physician being sent for, and 
something of the real cause of my illness being known, he 
ordered me to be let blood ; after which I had relief, and 
grew well : but I verily believe, if I had been eased by a 
▼ent given in that manner to the spirits, I should have died. 
I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand 
pounds sterling in money, and had an estate, as I might well 
call it, in the Brazils, of above a thousand pounds a year, as 
sure as an estate of lands in England ; and, in a word, I waa 
in a condition which I scarce knew how to understand, or 
how to compose myself for the enjoyment of it. The first 
thing I did was to recompense my original benefactor, my 
goo<l old captain, who had been first charitable to me in my 
distress, kind to me in my beginning, and honest to me at 
the end. I showed him all that was sent to me ; I told him, 
that next to the providence of Heaven, which disposed all 
things, it was omng to him ; and that it now lay on me to 
reward him, which I would do a hundred-fold: so I first 
returned to him the hundred moidores I had received o' 
him : then I sent for a notary, and caused him to draw up a 
general release or discharge from the four hundred and 
seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged he owed me, 
in the fullest and firmest manner possible. After which I 
caused a procuration to be drawn, empowering him to be mj 
receiver of the annual profits of my plantation, and apjJointF- 
ing my partner to account with him, and make the returns 
,3y the »isu il fleets to him in my name ; and a clause in the 
^nd, being i grant of one hundred moidores a year Vj iiinr 



816 ADVENTURES 0? 

during his life, out of the effects, and fifty inoidores a ywu 
to Ids son after him, for his life : and thus I recyiited my old 
man. 

I was now to consider which way to steer my course next 
and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus pu 
into my hands ; and, indeed, I had more care upon my he^% J 
now than I had in my silent state of life in the island, 
where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing 
but what I wanted ; whereas I had now a great charge upon 
me, and my business was how to secure it. I had never 
a ca^e now to hide my money in, or a place where it might 
lie without a lock or key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished, 
before any body would meddle with it ; on the contrary, I 
knew not where to put it, or whom to trust with it. My 
old patron, the captain, indeed, was honest, and that wag 
-he only refuge 1 had. In the next place, my interest in 
ihe Brazils seemed to summon me thither ; but now I cotdd 
not tell how to think of going thither till I had settled my 
affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands behind me. 
At first I thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew 
was honest, and would be -just to me ; but then she was in 
years, and but poor, and, for aught I knew, might be in 
debt : so that, in a word, 1 had no way but to go back to 
Kngland myself, and take my effects with me. 

It was some months, however, before I resolveu upon 
this ; and tAierefore, as I had rewarded the old captain fully, 
and to his satisfaction, who had been my former benefactor, 
•o I began tc think of my poor widow, whose husband had 
been my first benefactor, and she, while it was in her power, 
my faithful steward and instructor. So the first thing 1 did, 
1 get a merchant in lisbon to write to his correspondent in 
London, not only to pay a bill, but to go find her out, and 
cairy her in money a hundred pounds for me, and to talk 
with her, and comfort her in her poverty, by telling her sb* 
ihould, if I L \red, have a further supply : at the same rime < 



HOBINSON CRUSOE. JI7 

lent my two sisters in the country a hundred pounds tach, 
ihey being, though not in want, yet not in very good 
lircumstances ; one having been married and left a widow ; 
and the other having a husband not so kind to her as hf 
should be. But among all my relations or acquaintances, 1 
could not yet pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the 
gross of my stock, that I might go away to the Brazils, and 
leave things safe behind me ; and this greatly perplexed me. 

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and have 
settled myself there; for I was, as it were, naturalized to 
the place ; but 1 had some little scruple in my mind about 
religion, which insensibly drew me back. However, it was 
not religion which kept me from going there for the present ; 
and as I had made no scruple of being openlv of the 
religion of the country all the while I was among them, so 
neither did I yet ; only that, now and then, having of late 
thought more of it than formerly, when I began to think ol 
living and dying among them, I began to regret my having 
professed myself a papist, and thought it might not be the 
best religion to die with. 

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept 
me from going to the Brazils, but that really I did not know 
with whom to leave my effects behind me ; so I resolved, at 
last, to go to England with it, where, if 1 arrived, I con- 
cluded I should make some acquaintance, or find some 
relations that would be faithful to me ; and accordingly, 1 
prepared to go to England with all my wealth. 

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first, 
(he Brazil fleet being just going away, resolved to give 
Answers suitable to the just and faithful account of things I 
oad from thence ; and, first, to the prior of St. Augustine I 
wrote a letter full of thanks for their just dealings, and the 
offer of the eight hundred and seventy-two moidores which 
irere undisposed of, which 1 desired might be given, fiv« 
lon<fred to the monastery, an'^ thfee hundred and seventy-tw« 
27*

kO the poor, as the prior should direct ; desiring the good 
padre's prayers for me, and the like. 1 wrote next a lettei 
of thanks to my two trustees, with all the acknowledgmenl 
that so much justice and honesty called for ; as for sending 
them any present, they were far above having any occasion 
for it. Lastly, 1 wrote to my partner, acknc ivledging hia 
industry in the improving the plantation, and his integrit} 
in Increasing the stock of the works ; giving him instructioni 
Ibr his future government of my part, according to the powen 
i had left with my old patron, to whom I desired him to 
Bend whatever became due to me, till he should hear from 
me more particularly ; assuring him that it was my intention 
not only to come to him, but to settle myself there for the 
remainder of my life. To this I added a very handsome 
present of some Italian silks for his wife and two daughters, 
for such the captain's son informed me he had ; with two 
pieces of fine English broadcloth, the best I could get in 
Lisbon, five pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace o^ 
a good value. 

Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned 
all my effects into good bills of exchange, my next difficulty 
was, which way to go to England : 1 had been accustomed 
enough to the sea, and yet 1 had a strange aversion to go to 
England by sea at that time ; and though I could give m 
reason for it, yet the difficulty increased upon me so much, 
that though I had once shipped my baggage, in order to go^ 
yet I altered my mind, and that not once, but two or three 
times. 

It is true, 1 had been very unfortunate by sea, and this 
might be some of the reasons ; but let no man slight the 
•trong impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such 
moment : two of the ships which I had singled out to go in 
I mean more particularly singled out than any other, having 
put my things on board one of them, and in the other to 
haie agreed with the captain; I say, two of these shipi 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 31 j 

nuftc'atried, viz., one was taken by the Algerines, and th» 
other was cast away on the Start, nej.r Torbay and all the 
people drowned except three ; so that in either of those \ es- 
sels I had been made miserable. 

Having been thus harrassed in my thoughts, my old pilot 
to whom I communicated everything, pressed me earnestly 
ttot to go by sea, but either to go by land to the Groynf 
(Corunna), and cross over the Bay of Biscay to Rochellc, 
from whence it was but an easy and safe journey by land to 
Paris, and so to Calais and Dover ; or to go up to Madrid, 
and so all the way by land through France. In a word, I 
was so prepossessed against my going by sea at all, except 
from Calais to Dover, that II resolved to travel all the way 
by land ; which, as I was not in haste, and did not value 
the charge, was by much the pleasanter way : and to make 
it more so, my old captain brought an English gentleman, 
the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel 
with me ; after which we picked up two more English mer- 
chants also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last 
going to Paris only ; so that in all there were six of us, and 
five servants ; the two merchants and the two Portuguese 
contenting themselves with one servant between two, to save 
the charge ; and as for me, 1 got an English sailor to travel 
with me as a servant, besides my man Friday, who was too 
much a stranger to be capable of supplying the pkce of 
servant on the road. 

In this manner I set out from Lisbon ; and our compunj 
being very well mounted and armed, we made a little troop, 
whereof they did me the honor to call me captain, as well 
because I was the oldest man, as because I had two servants, 
and, indeed, was the' original of the whole journey. 

As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so 
I shall trouble you now with none of ny land journal : bn* 
fome adventures that happened to us in this tedioui eaaC 
iitficult journey I mv.U not omit. 



120 ADVENTURES OP 

When we can e to Madrid, we being all of us strangers tc 
Hpain, were willing to stay some time to see the court of 
Spain, and to see what was worth observing ; but it being 
the latter part of the sunmier, we hastened away, and set 
out from Madrid about the middle of October ; but when wt 
came to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at severai 
towns on the way, with an account that so much snow waa 
fallen on the French side of the mountains, that several 
travellers were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after 
Having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to pass on. 

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so, in« 
deed ; and to me, that had been always used to a hot climate 
and to countries where I could sc^ce bear any clothes on^ 
the cold was insufferable ; nor, indeed, was it more painful 
than surprising, to come but ten days before out of Old 
Castile, where the weather was not only warm, but very 
not, and immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean 
mountains, so very keen, so severely cold, as to be intolera- 
ble, and to endanger the benumbing and perishing of ovu 
fingers and toes. 

Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw the 
mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold weather, 
which he had never seen or felt before in his life. To mend 
the matter, when we came to Pampeluna, it continued snow- 
ing with so much violence, and so long, that the people said 
winter was come before its time ; and the roads, which were 
difficult before, were now quite impassable ; for, in a word, 
the snow lay in some places too thick for us to travel, and 
being not hard frozen, as is the case in the northern countries, 
there was no going without being in danger of being burie J 
ilive every step. We stayed no less than twenty days at Pam- 
peluna ; when seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood 
of its being better, for it was the severest winter all over Eu- 
rope that had been known in the memory of man, I proposed 
rhat we sho dd all s^o away to Fontarabia, and there take ship* 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 32| 

^ing for Bourdeaux, which was a very little voyage. But 
while I was considering this, there came in four French 
gentlemen, who having been stopped on the French side ol 
the passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out a 
guide, who traversing the country near the head of Langue« 
doc, had brought them over the mountains by such ways, 
that they were not much incommoded with the snow ; for 
where they met with snow in any quantity, they said it wai 
frozen hard enough to bear them and their horses. We sent 
for this guide, who told us he wotdd undertake to carry us 
the game way with no hazard from the snow, provided we 
were armed sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild beasts; 
for, he said, upon these great snows it was frequent for some 
wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains,' 
being made ravenous for w«rf of food, the ground being 
covered with snow. We told him we were well enough 
prepared for such creatures as they were, if he would insure 
us from a kind of two-legged wolves, which, we were told, 
we were in most danger from, especially on the French sidb 
ol the mountains. He <»atisfied us that there was no danger 
of that kind in the way that we were to go : so we readily 
agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other gentlemen, 
with their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, as I 
said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to come back 
again. 

Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna, with our guide, 
on the 15th of November; and, indeed, I was surprised, 
when, instead of going forward, he came directly back with 
us on the same road that we came from Madrid, about 
twenty miles ; when having passed two rivers, and came 
into the plain country, we found ourselves in a warm climate 
igain, where the country was pleasant, and no snow to be 
seen ; but on a sudden turning to his left, he approached 
the mountains another way ; and though it is true the hillt 
toi precipices looked dreadfrd, yet he made so many toora.

Ruch meanduis, and led us by such winding ways, tuat vm 
insensibly passed the height of the mountains without being 
much encumbered with the snow ; and, all on a sudden, he 
showed us the pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc and 
Oascony, all green and flourishing, though, indeed, at a 
great distance, and we had some rough way to pass still. 

We were a little uneasy, however when we found it 
•nowed one whole day and a night so fast, that we could 
not travel ; but he bid us be easy ; we should soon be. past 
it all : we found, indeed, that we began to descend every 
day, and to come more north than before ; and so, depend- 
ing upon our guide, we went on.

PRTDAT'S BNCOUNTBK with a bear — BOBINBON AND RI8 FB1.L0W 
TBATBLLBBS ATTACKED BT A PLOCK OP WOLVES — HIS ARRANOE- 
MBNT OP HIS APPAIR8, AND MARRIAGE AFTER HIS RETURN TO 
ENGLAND. 

It was about two hours before night, when our guide being 
something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three 
monstrous wolves, and after them a bear, out of a holfbw 
way, sdjoming to a thick wood ; two of the wolves made at 
the guide, and had he been far before us, he would have 
^en devoured before we could have helped him ; one oi 
them fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the 
man with that violence, that he had not time, or piesence ol 
mind enough, to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out 
to me most lustily. My man Friday being next to me, I 
bade him ride up, and see what was the matter. As soon 
as Friday came in sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud 



ttOBINSON CUUSOE. 323 

M the other, O master! O master ! b%t, like a bold fellow, 
rode directly up to the poor man, and with his pistol shot 
the wolf, that attacked him, in the head. 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Fri- 
day ; for he having been used to such creatures in liis 
country, he had no fear respecting them, but went close up 
to him and shot him, as above ; whereas any other of us 
would have fired at a greater distance, and have perhaps 
either missed the wolf, or endangered shooting the man. 

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I ; 
and, indeed, it alarmed all our company, when, with tht 
noise of Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides the most 
dismal howling of wolves ; and the noise, redoubled by the 
echo of the mountains, appeared to us as if there had been 
a prodigious number of them ; and, perhaps, there was not 
such a few as that we had no cause of apprehensions : how- 
ever, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other that had 
fastened upon the horse left him immediately, and fled, 
without doing him any damage, having happily fastened 
upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in 
his teeth. But the man was most hurt ; for the raging 
creature had bit him twice, once in the arm, and the other 
time a little above his knee ; and though he had made some 
defence, he was just as it were tumbling down by the dis- 
order of his horse, w^hen Friday came up and shot the wolf. 
, It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Fnday's pistol 
we all mended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, 
which was very difficult, would give us leave, to see whai 
was the matter. As soon as we came clear of the trees, 
which blinded us before, we saw clearly what had been tiie 
case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though 
we did not presently discern what kind of creature it was h» 
'lad killed. 

But never was a fight managed so hardii) , and in such a 
surprising manner, as that which followed, between Friday 



524 ADVENTURES OF 

and the licar. which gave us all, though at first we wen 
surpmed and afraid for him, the greatest diversion imagina- 
ble. Am the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does no* 
gallop as the wolf docs, who is swift and light, so he has 
two pjirtic\ilar qualities, which generally are the rule of his 
at' tons: first, as to men, who are not his proper prey (he 
does not usually attempt them, except they first attack him, 
unless he be excessively hungry, which it is probable might 
now be the case, the ground being covered with snow), il 
you do not meddle with him, he will not meddle with you : 
but then you must take care to be very civil to him, and 
give him the road, for he is a very nice gentleman ; he will 
not go a step out of his way for a prince ; nay, if you are 
really afraid, your best way is to look another way, and 
keep going on ; for sometimes if you stop, and stand still, 
and look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an afiront ; but 
if you throw or toss anything at him, and it hits him, though 
it were but a bit of stick as big as your finger, he thinks ' 
himself abused, and sets all other business aside to pursue 
his revenge, and will have satisfaction in point of honor ; — 
this is his first quality : the next is, if he be once affronted, 
ne will never leave you, night nor day, till he has his 
revenge, but follows, at a good round rate, till he overtakes 
you. 

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when .ve 
came up to him, he was helping him off from his horse, foi 
the man was both hurt and frightened, when, on a suiden, 
we espied the bear come out of the wood, and a vast, zirn- 
strous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw. We 
were all a little surprised when we saw him ; but when 
Friday saw him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the 
l;llow*s countenence ; O, O, O ! says Friday, three times, 
^•^•iuting to him ; O master ! you give me te leave, mc 
»nakee te hand with him ; me makee you good laugh. 

I was S'lrprised to see the fellow so well pleased : Yov 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. Z2b 

fool, says I, he will eat you up. — Eatee me up ! eatce m« 
up . says Friday, twice over again ; me eatee him up ; me 
ma^ee you good laugh : you all stay here, me show you 
good laugh. So down he sits, and gets off his boots in a 
moment, and puts on a pair of pumps (as we call the flat 
shoes they wear, and which he had in his pocket), gives my 
other servant his horse, and with his gun away he flew, swift 
like the wind. 

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle 
with nobody, till Friday coming pretty nea|r, calls to him, as 
if the bear could understand him. Hark ye, hark ye, says 
Friday, me speakee with you. We followed at distance ; for 
now being come down on the Gascony side of the mountains, 
we were entered a vast great forest, where the country waa 
plain and pretty open, though it had many trees in it 
scattered here and there. Friday, who had, as we say, the 
heels of the bear, came up with him quickly, and takes up a 
great stone and throws it at him, and hit him just on the 
head, but did him no more harm than if he had thrown it 
against a wall ; but it answered Friday's end, for the rogue 
was so void of fear that he did it purely to make the bear 
follow him, and show us some laugh as he called it. As 
soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw him, he turns about, 
and comes after him, taking devilish long strides, and shuf- 
fling on at a strange rate, such as would have put a horse tc 
a middling gallop ; away runs Friday, and takes his course 
as if he run towards us for help ; so we all resolved to fire 
at once upon the bear, and deliver my man ; though I wai 
angry at him heartily for bringing the bear back upon us, 
when he was going about his own business another way ; 
auil especially I was angry that he had turned the bear upon 
us, and then run away ; and I called out, You dog, is this 
your making us laugh ? Come away, and take your horse, 
that we may shoot the creature. He heard me, and cned 
»it, No shoot, n shoot: stand still, and you get much

526 ADVENTURES OF 

(:;tugii ; ami us the nimble creature run two feet io\ the c^ai*i 
one. he turned on a sudden, on one side of us, and seeing a 
great oak tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to 
^ollow ; and doubling his pace, he gets nimbly up the tree, 
laying his gun down upon the ground, at about five or six 
yards from the bottom of the tree. The bear soon came 
to the tree, ind we followed at a distance ; the first thing 
he did, he stopped at the gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and 
up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so 
monstrous heavy • 1 was amazed, at the folly, as I thought 
it, of my man, and could not for my life see anything to 
laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode 
aour to him. 

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to 
the fmall end of a large branch, and the bear got about hali 
A^ay to him. As soon as the bear got out to that part where 
the limb of the tree was weaker, — Ha ! says he to us, now 
you see me teachee the bear dimce : so he falls a jumping an«4 
shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but 
stood still, and began to look behind him, to see how he 
should get back ; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. But 
Friday had not done with him by a great deal ; when seeing 
him stand still, he calls out to him again, as if ht had sup- 
posed the bear could speak English, What, you come nc 
farther ? pray you come farther : so he left jumpin'^ and 
shaking the tree ^ and the bear, just as if he understood what 
he said, did come a little farther; then he fell a jumping 
again, and the bear stopped again. We thought now w as 
a good time to knock him on the head, and called to Fridaj 
to stand still, and we would shoot the bear : but he cried 
out earnestly, O pray ! O pray! no shoot, me shoot by and 
then; he would have said by and by. However, to shoittr 
the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so 
Uckli^h, that we had laughing enough, but still could noi 
Onatfine what tlie fellow would do : for first we thoujj|;ht htf 




I 



UOBINS0>N CRUSOE. 8i" 

iepended upon shaking the bear off; and we found ine beai 
was too cunning for that too ; for he would not go out fai 
pnough to be thrown down, but clings fast with his grrat 
broad claws and feet, so that we could not imagine what 
would be the end of it, and what the jest would be at last. 
But Friday puts us out of doubt quickly : for seeing the beat 
cling fast to the bough, and that he would not be persuaded 
to come any farther. Well, well, says Friday, you no come 
farther, me go ; you no come to me, me come to you : and 
upon this, he goes out to the smaller end of the bough, 
where it would bend with his weight, and gently lets himseL 
down by it, sliding down the bough, till he came near enough 
to jump down on his feet, and away he runs to his gun, 
takes it up, and stands still. Well, said I to him, Friday, 
what will you do now ? Why don't you shoot him ? — No 
shoot, says Friday, no yet : me no shoot now, me no kill ; 
me stay, give you one more laugh ; and, indeed, so he did, 
as you will see presently : for when the bear saw his enemy 
gone, he comes back from the bough where he stood, but did 
it mighty cautiously, looking behind him every step, and 
coming backward till he got into the body of the tree ; then 
with the same hinder-end foremost, he came down the tree, 
grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, 
very leisurely. At this juncture, and just before he could 
set his hind-foot on the ground, Friday stepped up close to 
him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot 
him dead. Then the rogue turned about, to see if we did 
not laugh ; and when he saw we were pleased, by our looks 
he falls a laughing himself very loud. So we kill bear in my 
country, says Friday. So you kill them ? says I : why you 
have no guns. — No, says he, no gun, but shoot great much 
long arrow. This was a good diversion to us ; but we were 
•till in a wild place, and ^ur g'lide very much hurt, \nd 
what to do we hardly knew : the howling of wolves run 
!iiuch in my head ; and, indeed, except the noise I one* 



528 ADVENTURliS ur 

heard on the shore of Africa, of which I have said somcihing 
already, I ne^er heard anything that filled me with so much 
horror. 

These things, and the approach of night, called us off, oi 
else, as Friday would have had us, we should aertainly have * 
taken the skin of this monstrous creature off, which was 
wcrth saving ; but we had near three leagues to go, and our 
guide hastened us, so we left him, and went forward on our 
journey. 

The ground was still covered with snow, though not so 
deep and dangerous as on the mountains ; and the ravenous 
creatures, as we heard afterwards, were come down into the 
forest and plain country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food, 
and had done a great deal of mischief in the villages, where 
they surprised the country people, killed a great many oi 
their sheep and horses, and some people too. We had one 
dangerous place to pass, of which our guide told us, if there 
were more wolves in the country we should find them there ; 
and this was a small plain, surrounded with woods on every 
side, and a long narrow defile, or lane, which we were to 
pass to get through the wood, and then we should come to 
the village where we were to lodge. It was within a half 
♦n hour of sunset when we entered the first wood, and a 
dttle after sunset when we came into the plain. We met 
vith nothing in the first wood, except that, in a little plain 
within the wood, which was not above two furlongs over, 
we saw five great wolves cross the road, full speed one after 
another, as if they had been in chase of some prey, and had 
it in view ; they took no notice of us, and were gone out oi 
bight in a few moments. Upon this our guide, who, by the 
way, was but a faint-hearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready 
posture, for he believed there were mor^wolves a-coming. Wt 
kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us ; but we saw 
ao more wolves till we came through that wood, which wai 
'^car h&lf a league, and entered the plain. As soon as wi 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 5^23 

eame ii tt the plain, we had occasion enoiign to look aboui 
as : the first object we met >vith was a dead horse, that is ic 
lay, a poor horse which the wolves had killed, and at least a 
dozen of them at work, we could not say eating of him, but 
picking of his bones rather : for they had eaten up all the 
liesh before. We did not think fit to disturb them at theii 
feast ; neither did they take much notice of us. Friday 
wo.dd have let fly at them, but 1 would not suSer him by 
any means ; for I found we were like to have more business 
upon our hands than we were aware of. We were not gone 
half over the plain, when we began to hear the wolves howl 
in the wood on our left in a fiightful manner, and presently 
after we saw about a hundred coming on directly towards us, 
all in a body, and most of them in a line, as regularly as an 
army drawn up by an experienced officer. I scarce knew 
in what manner to receive them, but found to draw ourselves 
in a close line was the only way : so we formed in a 
moment : but that we might not have too much interval, I 
ordered that only every other man should fire, and that the 
others who had not fired should stand ready to give them a 
second volley immediately, if they continued to advance* 
upon us ; and then that those who had fired at first should 
not pretend to load their fusees again, but stand ready 
every one with a pistol, for we were all armed with a fusee 
and a pair of pistols each man ; so we were, by this 'method, 
able to fire six volleys, half of us at a time. However, at 
present we had no necessity : for upon firing the first volley, 
the enemy made a full stop, being terrified as well with the 
noise as with the fire ; four of them, being shot in the head, 
dropped ; several others were wounded, and went bleeding 
aff, as we could see by the snow. I found they stopped, but 
iid not immediately retreat ; whereupon, remembering that 
C had been told that the fiercest creatures were terrified at 
ihe voice of a man, I caused all the company to halloo as 
^•ud as we could ; and I found the notion not altoge\hef 
28* 



530 ADVENTURES OF / 

mistaken ; for upon our shout, tbey began to retire and 
turn about. 1 then ordered a second volley to be fired in 
Jieir rear, which put them to the gallop, and away they wen< 
to the woods. This gave us leisure to charge our piecef 
again ; and l^at we might lose no time, we kept going ; but 
we had but little more than loaded our fusees, and put our- 
selves in readiness, when we heard a terrible noise in tlie 
same wood, on our left, only that it was farther onward, the 
same way we were to go. 

The night was coming on, and the light began to b6 
dusky, which made it worse on our side ; but the noise 
increasing, we could easily perceive that it was the howling 
and yelling of those hellish creatures ; and on a sudden we 
perceived two or three troops of wolves, one on our left, 
one behind us, and one in our front, so that we seemed to 
be surrounded with them : however, as they did not fall 
upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as we could make 
our horses go, which, the way being very rough, was only a 
good hard trot. In this manner we came in view of the 
entrance of the wood, through which we were to pass, at 
the farther side of the plain ; but we were greatly surprised, 
when, coming nearer the lane or pass, we saw a confused 
number of wolves standing just at the entrance. On a 
sudden, at another opening of a wood, we heard the noise of 
b gun, and looking that way out rushed a horse, with a 
saddle and bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteec 
or seventeen wolves after him, full speed ; indeed, tbe horse 
had the heels of them, but as we supposed that he could net 
hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they would get up 
with him at last ; no question but they did. 

But here we had a most horrible sight ; for riding up to 
the entrance where the horse came out, we found tiie 
carcasses of another horse and of two men, devoured by the 
aver.ous creatures ; and one of the men was no doubt th« 
same whonr. we heard fir) the gun, for there la) a gun jufi 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^ 

oy hpn fired off; but as to the man, his head and the uppe* 
|»*.rt of his body were eaten up. This filled us with horror, 
and we knew not what course to take ; but the creaturei 
resolved us soon, for they gathered about us presently, in 
Lopes of prey; and I verily believe there were three 
hundred of them. It happened very much to our advantage^ 
that at the entrance into the wood, but a little way fiora it 
there lay some large timber trees, which had been cut dowa 
the summer before, and I suppose lay there for carriage, i 
drew my little troop in among those trees, and placing 
ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I advised them all 
to alight, and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork, 
to stand in a triangle or three fronts enclosing our horses ir 
the centre. We did so, and it was well we did ; for never 
was a more furious charge than the creatures made upon us 
in this place. They came on with a growling kind of noise, 
and mounted the piece of timber, which, as I said, was our 
breastwork, as if they were only rushing upon their prey : 
and this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned 
by their seeing our horses behind us. I ordered our men to 
fire as befoi[^ every other man : and they took their aims so 
sure, that they killed several of the wolves at the first 
volley : but there was a necessity to keep a continual firing, 
for they came on like devils, those behind pushing en those 
before. 

When we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we 
thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they would have 
gone off; but it was but a moment, for others came forwari 
again : so we fired two volleys of our pistols ; and I believe 
in these four firings we had killed seventeen or dghtcen o^ 
them, and lamed twice as many, yet they came on again. J 
was loth to spend our shot too hastily : so I called my 
servant, not my man Friday, for he was better employed, 
h%, with the greatest dexterity imaginable, he had iharged 
nj fusee and his own while we were engaged ; but as I said 



132 ADVENTURES OF 

[ caie«l my other man, and giving him a horn of po^ ler, 
I bada him lay a train all along the piece of timber, and let 
It be a large train. He did so : and had but just time to 
get away, when the wolves came up to it, and some gol 
upon it, when I, snapping an uncharged pistol close to the 
powder, set it on fire : those that were upon the timber wert 
scorched with it ; and six or seven of them fell or rathei 
jumped in among us, with the force and fright of the fire: 
we dispatched these in an instant, and the rest were so 
frightened with the light, which the night, for it was now 
very dark, made more terrible, that they drew back a little ; 
upon which I ordered o*ur last pistols to be fired 03" in one 
volley, and after that we gave a shout : upon this the wolves 
turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near twenty 
lame ones, that we found struggling on the ground, and fell 
a cutting them with our swords, which answered our 
expectation : for the crying and howling they made was 
better understood by their fellows ; so that they all fled and 
left us. 

We had, first and last, killed about threescore of them ; 
and had it been daylight, we had killed many^ore. The 
field of battle being thus cleared, we made forward again, 
for we had still near a league to go. We heard the ravenous 
creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went, severa] 
times, and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them, but 
the snow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain : in about 
Ln ho ir more we came to the town where we were to lodge, 
which we found in a terrible fright, and all in arms ; for, if 
Lt seems, the night before, the wolves and some bears had 
ke into the village, and put them in such terror, that 
they were obliged to keep guard night and day, but 
especially in the night, to preserve their cattle, and, indeed 
their peop.e. 

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbf 
welled vo much with the rankling of his two wourds, thai

\ wcoid go uo farther; so we were obliged to take > 
h%.w fCuide here, and go to Thoulouse, where we found « 
warm wimate, a xVuitful, pleasant country, and no snow, d« 
wolves, nor anything like them ; but when we told our 
story at Thculouse, they told us it was nothing but what 
was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the mountains, 
especially when the snow lay on the ground; but they 
inquired much what kind of a guide we had got, who would 
venture to bring us that way in such a severe season ; and 
told us it was surprising we were not all devoured. When 
we told them how we placed ourselves, and the horses in 
the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was 
fifty to one but we had been all destroyed ; for it was the 
sight of the horses which made the wolves so furious, seeing 
their prey : and that, at other times, they are really afraid ol 
a gun ; but being excessive hungry, and raging on that 
account, the eagerness to come at the horses had made 
them senselets of danger; and that if we had not, by the 
continued fiit, and at last by the stratagem of the train ol 
powder, mastered them, it had been great odds but that we 
had been teifn to pieces : that whereas, had we been content to 
have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would 
not have take/x the horses so much for their own, when men 
were on their Nacks, as otherwise ; and withal they told us, 
that, at last, if we had stood altogether, and left our horses, 
(hey would hav«?» been so eager to have devoured them, that 
we might have Ct>me oflf safe, especially having our fire-anm 
in our hands, and being so many in number. For my part, 
I was never so sensible of danger in my life ; for seeing above 
three hundred devils come roaring and open-mouthed to de- 
vour us, and having nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave 
myself over for lost ; and, as it was, 1 believe I shall never 
eare to cross those mountains again : I think I would mucL 
rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I was sure f' 
nee* with a storm once a week. 



134 ADVENTURES OF 

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of n my pasivgfl 
through France, nothing but what other tiavellers have 
given an account of, with much more advantage than I can. 
I travelled from Thoulouse to Paris, and without any 
considerable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover, 
the 14th of January, after having a severe cold season to 
trafel in. 

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a 
11 1 tie time all my new discovered estate safe about me ; the 
bills of exchange which 1 brought with me having been very 
currently paid. 

My principal guide and privy counsellor was my good 
ancient widow ; who, in gratitude for the money I had sent* 
her, thought no pains too much, nor care too great, to 
employ fo? me ; and I trusted her so entirely with every- 
thing, that I was perfectly easy as to the security of my 
effects : and, indeed, I was very happy from the beginning, 
and now to the end, in the unspotted integrity of thii 
good gentlewoman. 

I now resolved to dispose of my plantation in the Brazils, 
if I could find means. For this {)urpose, 1 wrote to my ol'H 
friend at Lisbon, who having offered it to the t»vo merchants.) 
the survivors of ray trustees, who lived in the Brazils, they 
accepted the offer, and remitted thirty-three thousand piece/t 
of eight to a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it 
Having signed the instrument of sale, and sent it to my old 
friend, he remitted me bills of exchange for thirty-two 
thousand eight hundred pieces of eight for the estate, 
reserving the payment of a hundred moidores a year to 
himself during his life, and fifty moidores afterwards to his 
Bon for life, which 1 had promised them. 

Though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could 
not keep the country out of my head ; nor could I resist the 
•trong inclination I had to see my island. My true friend« 
rhe widow, earnestly dissuaded me from it, and so fat 



KOBINSON CRUSOJffi. Z*6t 

prevailed with me, that for almost seven yeirs, she pre- 
Tented my running abroad ; during which time 1 took my 
^W: n<>phew8, the children of one of my brothers, into my 
care : the eldest having something of his own, I bred up as 
a g»T:tleman, and gave him a settlement of some addition to 
nis estate, after my decease. The other I put out to a 
captain of a ship ; and after five years, finding him a 
sensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into a 
good ship, and sent him to sea : and this young fellow after- 
wards drew me in, old -as I was to further udventurct 
myself. 

In the mean time, I in part settled myself here ; for, first 
of all, 1 married, and that not either to my disadvantage 
or dissatisfaction, and had three children, two sons and one 
daughter ; but my wife dying, and my nephew conang home 
with good success from a voyage to Spain, my inclination tci 
go abroad, and his importunity prevailed, and engaged me 
to go in his ship as a private trader to the East indies : thia 
was in the year 1694. 

But these things, with some very surprising incidents in 
some new adventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall 
give a further account of. 

That homely proverb used on so many occasions la 
England, viz., " That what is bred in the bone will not go 
out of the flesh," was never more verified than in the story 
of my life. Any one woidd think that, after five years* 
jffliction, and a variety of unhappy circumstances, which 
few men, if any, ever went through before, and after neai 
seven years of peace and enjoyment in the fullness of all 
ihings, grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed 
me to have had expenence of every state of middle life, and 
•^o knov^ which was most adapted to make a man C( mpletelj 
happy; I say, after all this, any one would have thought 
that the native propensity to rambling, which I gate an 
account of in my first setting out in, the world to have beer

BO predominant in my thoughts, should be worn out, Uxt 
volatile part be fully evacuated, or at least coi.densed, and 1 
might, at sixty-one years of age, have been a little inclined 
to stay at home, and have done venturing life and fortune 
any more. 

Nay, further, the common motive of foreign advent urea 
was taken away in me; for I had no fortune to make; I had 
nothing to seek : if I had gained ten thousand pounds, 1 
had been no richer ; for I had already sufficient for me, and 
f( r those I had to leave it to ; and that I had was visibly 
incrciising ; for having no great family, I could not spend 
the income of what I had, unless I would set up for an 
expensive way of living, such as a great family, servants, 
equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were things I had no 
notion of, or inclination to ; so that I had nothing indeed to 
do but to sit still, and fully enjoy what I had got, and see it 
increase daily upon my hands. Yet all these things had no 
effect upon me, or at least not enough to resist the strong 
inclination I had to go abroad again, which hung about me 
like a chronical distemper. In particular, the desire oi 
seeing my new plantation in the island, and the colony I 
left there, ran in my head continually. I dreamed of it aU 
night, and my imagination ran upon it all day ; it was 
uppermost in all my thoughts; and my fancy x^orked so 
steadily and strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my 
Bleep : in short, nothing could remove it out of my mind : 
it even broke so violently into all my discourses, that 
it made my conversation tiresome, for I could talk oJ 
nothing else : all my discourse ran into it, even to imper* 
tiiien<^ ; and I taw it in mj^ell

1 UAVE often heard persons of good judgment say, that all 
the stir people make in the world about ghosts and appari- 
tions is owing to the strength of imagination, and the 
powerful operation of fancy in their minds ; that there is no 
such thing as a spirit appearing, or a ghost walking, and 
the like ; that people's poring affectionately upon the past 
conversation of their deceased friends, so realizes it to them, 
that they are capable of fancying, upon some extraordinary 
circumstances, that they see them, talk to them, and are 
answered by them, when, in truth, there is nothing but 
shadow and vapor in the thing, and they really km^w 
nothing of the matter. 

For my part, I know not to this hour whether there are 
any such things as real apparitions, spectres, or walking ol 
people after they are dead; or whether there is anything in 
the stories they tell us of that kind, more than the product 
of vapors, sick minds, and wandering fancies ; but this 1 
know, that my imagination worked up to such a height, and 
brought me into such excess of vapors, or what else I may 
call it, that I actually supposed myself often upon the spot, 
at my old castle, behind the trees ; saw my old Spaniard, 
Friday's father, and the reprobate sailors 1 left upon the 
island; nay, I fancied I talked with them, and looked at 
them steadily, though I was broad awake, as at persons just 
before me ; and this I did till I often frightened myself with 
the images my fancy represented to me. One time, in my 
sleep, I hud the villany of the three pirate sailors so lively

Saa ADVBNTUBES OP 

related to me by the first Spaniard and Friday's fatbtr, thai 
It was surprising : they told me how tney barl arousl j 
attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and that they set 
fire to the provisions they had laid up, on purpose to 
distress and starve them; things that I had never heard ofi 
and thf\t indeed were never all of them true in fact ; but it 
was so warm in my imagination, and so realized to me, that, 
to the hour I saw them, I could not be persuaded but that it 
was, or would be true : also how I resented it, when the 
Spaniard complained to me ; and how I brought them to 
justice, tried them before me, and ordered them all three to 
be hanged. What there was really in this shall be seen in 
us place : for however I came to form such things in my 
dream, and what secret converse of spirits injected it, yet 
there was, I say, much of it true. I own that this dream 
had nothing in it literally and specifically true; but the 
general part was so true, the base, villanous behaviour of 
these three hardened rogues was such, and had been so 
much worse than all I can describe, that the dream had too 
much similitude of the fact ; and as 1 would afterwards have 
imnished them severely, so, if I had hanged them all, I had 
been much in the right, and even should have been justified 
both by the laws of God and man. But to return to ray 
story, ^n this kind of temper 1 lived some years ; I had no 
enjoyment of my life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable diver- 
sion, but what had something or other of this in it ; so that 
my wife, who saw my mind wholly bent upon it, told me 
very seriously one night, that she believed there was some 
secret powerful impulse of Providence upon me, which had 
•letermined me to go thither again; and that she found 
nothmg hindered my going, but my being engaged to a wife 
and children. She told me, that it was true she could not 
think of parting with me ; but as she was assured, that il 
she was dead it would be the first thing I would do, so, as 
AM It seemed to her that the th^ng was determined above.

•he would not be the only obstruction ; for, if I tho igLt fit, 

and resolved to go Here she found me very intent upot 

her words, and that I looked very earnestly at her, so that it 
A little disordered her, and she stopped. I asked her why 
bh 3 did not go on, and say out what she was going to say ? 
But I perceived that her heart was too full, and some tears 
f'ood in her eyes. Speak out, my dear, said 1; are you 
willing I should go ? No, says she, very affectionately, I am 
far from willing ; but if you are resolved to go, says she, and 
rather than 1 would be the only hinderance, 1 will go with 
you : for though 1 think it a most preposterous thing for one 
of your years, and in your condition, yet if it must be, 8<dd 
she, again weeping, I would not leave you ; for if it be o/ 
Heaven, you must do it ; there is no resisting it : and i/ 
Heaven make it your duty to go, he will also make it mine 
to go with you, or otherwise dispose of me, that I may not 
obstruct it. 

This affectionate behavior of my wife's brought me a 
little out of the vapors, and I began to consider what I was 
doing : I corrected my wandering fancy, and I began to 
argue with myself sedately, what business I had, after three- 
score years, and after such a life of tedious sufferings and 
disasters, and closed in so happy and easy a manner ; I say, 
what business had I to rush into new hazards, and put my- 
self upon adventures fit only for youth and poverty to run 
into ? 

With those 'thoughts I considered my new engagements ; 
that I had a wife, one child bom, and my wife then great 
with child of another; that I had all the world could give 
me, and had no need to seek hazard for gain ; that I wa*« 
lee lining in yearft, and ought to think rather of leaving 
what I had gained, than of seeking to increase it ; that aa 
^<3 what my wife had said of its being an i:npulse fi-om 
Heaven, and that it should be my duty to k^, I had nc 
njticQ of that; so, after many of these cogitations, i

ilruggled with tlie power of my ima ^nation, reascnei 
myself out of it, as I believe people may always do in lik« 
cases if they will ; and in a word, I conquered it ; composed 
myself with such arguments as occurred to my thoughts, and 
which my present condition furnished me plentifully with ; 
and particularly, as the most effectual method, I resolved to 
divert myself with other things, and to engage in some 
business that might effectually tie me up from any more 
excursions of this kind; for I found that thing return 
upon me chiefly when I was idle, and had nothing to do, 
nor anything of moment immediately before me. To this 
purpose I bought a little farm in the county of Bedford, 
and resolved to remove myself thither. I had a little con- 
venient house upon it ; and the land about it, 1 found wat 
capable of great improvement; and it was many wayb 
suited to my inclination, which delighted in cultivating, 
managing, planting, and improving of land ; and par- 
ticularly, being an inland country, I was removed from 
conversing among sailors, and things relating to remote 
parts of the world. 

In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my family, 
bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon, horses, cows^ 
and sheep, and setting seriously to work, became, in one 
bilf year, a mere country gentleman; my thoughts were 
entirely taken up in managing my servants, cultivating the 
^ound, enclosing planting, &/C. ; and I lived, as I thought, 
the most agreeable life that nature was capable of directing, 
or that a man always bred to misfortunes was capable ol 
retreating to. 

I farmed upon my own land ; I had no rent to pay, was lim- 
ted by no articles : I could pull up or cut down as I pleased ; 
wrhat I planted was for myself, and what I improved wa« 
for my family ; and having thus left off the thoughts o. 
wandering, I had not the least discomfort in any part o 
life ad to this worM. Now I thought indeed that 1 enjoyed 



ROBINSON CKUSOE. 34^ 

tlie mid lie state of life which my father so earnestly recom- 
mended to me, and lived a kind of heavenly life, something 
like what is described by the poet, upon the subject of t 
ft)untry life — 

** — Free from vices, free from care. 
Age has no pain, and youth no snare." 

But, in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from 
unseen Providence unhinged me at once ; and not only 
made a breach upon me inevitable and incurable, but drove 
me, by its consequences, into a deep relapse of the wander- 
ing disposition, which, as I may say, being bom in my very 
blood, soon recovered its hold of me, and, like the returns 
of a violent distemper, came on with an irresistible force 
upon me. This blow was the loss of my wife. It is no** 
my business here to write an elegy upon my wife, give a 
character of her particular virtues, and make my court to 
the sex by the flattery of a funeral sermon. She was, in a 
few words, the stay of all my affairs, the centre of all my 
enterprises, the engine that, by her prudence, reduced me to 
that happy compass I was in, from the most extravagant and 
ruinous project that fluttered in my head, as above, and did 
more to guide my rambling genius than a mother's tears, a 
father's instructions, a friend's counsel, or all my own rea- 
soning powers could do. I was happy in listening to her 
tears, and in being moved by her entreaties ; and to the 
last degree desolate and dislocated itt the world by the lost 
of her. 

When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round 
me. I was as much a stranger in it, in my thoughts, as ] 
was in the Brazils, when I flrst went on shore there ; and 
E8 much alone, except as to the assistance of servants, as ] 
was in my island. I knew neither what to think nor what 
jy do. I saw the world busy around me : one part laboring 
"br broad, another squandering in vile excesses or empty

pleaF ires, equally miserable, beca-se the eud they propo86<1 
•till fled from them : for the men of pleasure every day 
tufeited of their vice, and heaped up work for sorrow and 
rep3ntance ; and the men of labor spent their strength in 
daily struggling for bread to maintain the vital strength the} 
labored with : so living in a daily circulation on sorrow, 
living but to work, and working but to live, as if daily bread 
were the only end of wearisome life, and a wearisome li^ 
the only occasion of daily bread. 

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, 
the island ; where I suffered no more com to grow, because 
I did not want it, and bred no more goats, because I had no 
more use for them ; where the money lay in the drawer till 
it grew mouldy, and had scarce the favor to be looked upon 
in twenty years. 

All these things, had I improved them as I ought to have 
done, and as reason and religion had dictated to me, would 
have taught me to search farther than human enjoyments for 
a full felicity ; and that there was something which certainly 
vas the reason and end of life, superior to all these things, 
and which was either to be possessed, or a^ least hoped for, 
on this side the grave. 

But my sage counsellor was gone ; I was like a ship with- 
out a pilot, that co\ild only run afore the wind : my thoughts 
ran all away again into the old affair ; my head was quite 
turned with the whimsies of foreign adventures ; and all the 
pleasant, innocent amusements of my farm, my garden, my 
cattle, and my family, which before entirely possessed me, 
were nothing to me, had no relish, and were like music to 
one that has no ear, or food to one that has no taste : in a 
word, I resolved to leave off housekeeping, let my farm, and 
return to London ; and in a few months after I did so. 

When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I was 
oefore ; I had no relish for tne place, no employment in it, 
ftoihing to do but to saunter about like an idle person^ o^

irhoin it may be said he in perfectly useless m God*i crea- 
tion, and it is not one farthing's matter to tJie rest of hit 
Kind whether he be dead or alive. This also was the thing 
which, of all other circumstances of life, was the most mj 
aversion, who had been all my days used to an active life ; 
and I would often say to myself: A state of idleness is the 
very dregs of life ; and indeed I thought I was much more 
suitably employed when I was twenty-six days making me a 
deal board. 

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my 
nephew, whom, as I have observed before, I had brought up 
to the sea, and had made him commander of a ship, was 
come home from a short voyage to Bilboa, being the first he 
had made. He came to me, and told me that some mer- 
chants of his acquaintance had been proposing to him to go 
a voyage for them to the East Indies and to China, as private 
traders. — ^And now, uncle, says he, if you will go to sea 
with me, I will engage to land you upon your old habitation 
in the island ; for we are to touch at the Brazils. 

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state, 
and of the existence of an invisible world, than the concur- 
rence of second causes with the ideas of things which we 
form in our minds, perfectly reserved, and not communicated 
to any in the world. 

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of 
wandering was returned upon me, and I knew nothing of 
what he had in his thoughts to say, when the very morning, 
before he came to me, I had, in a great deal of confusion 
of thought, and revolving every part of my circumstances in 
my mind, come to this resolution, viz., that I wouli go to 
Lisbon, and consult with my old sea-captain ; and 90, if it 
was rational and practicable, I would go and see the island 
ftgain, and see what was become of my people there. I had 
pleased myself with the thoughts of peopling the place, and 
tanring ^uliabitants from hence, getting a patent for the pot

•ession, and I knew not what ; whc n, in the mic.dle of aT. 
ihis, in comes my nephew, as I have said, with his project 
of carrying me thither in his way to the East Indies. 

I paused awhile at his words, and, looking steadily a1 
him. What devil, said I, sent you on this unlucky errand ? 
My nephew stared, as if he had been frightened, at first ; but 
perceiving that I was not so much displeased with the pro- 
posal, he recovered himself. I hope it may not be an 
unlucky proposal, sir, says he ; I dare say you would be 
pleased to see your new colony there, where you once 
reigned with more felicity than most of your brother- 
monarchs in the world. 

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my temper, that 
9 to say, the prepossession I was under, and of which I 
Lave said so much, that I told him, in a few words, if he 
agreed \vith the merchants I would go with him ; but I told 
him I would not promise to go any farther than my own 
island. Why, sir, says he, you dbn*t want to be left there 
again, I hope ? Why, said I, can you not take me up agair 
on your return ? He told me it would not be possible to do 
so ; that the merchants would never allow him to come tha* 
way with a laden ship of such value, it being a month's sail 
out of his way, and might be three or four. Besides, sir, i. 
I should miscarry, said he, and not return at all, then you 
would be just reduced to the condition you were in before. 

This was very rational ; but we both found out a remedy 
for it ; which was to carry a framed sloop on board the ship, 
which being taken in pieces, and shipped on board the ship, 
might by the help of some carpenters, whom we agreed to 
earry with us, be set up again in the island, and finished, fit 
to go to sea, in a few days. 

I was not long resolving ; for indeed the importunities o' 
my nephew joined so effectually with my inclination, that 
nothing could oppose me : on the other hand, my wife bein^ 
liead, 1 hai nobody concerning themselves so much for m^

M to persuade me to one way or the othei^ except my 
Ancient good friend the widow, who earnest y struggled 
with me to consider my years, my easy circumstances, and 
the needless hazards of a long voyage ; and, above all, my 
young children. But it was all to no purpose ; — I had an 
irresistible desire to the voyage ; and I told her I thought 
there was something so uncommon in the impression I had 
apon my mind for the voyage, that it would be a kind ol 
resisting Providence if I should attempt to stay at home : 
after which she ceased her expostulations, and joined with 
me, not only in making provision for my voyage, but also in 
settling my family affairs for my absence, and providing for 
the education of my children. 

In order to this, I made my will, and settled the estate 1 
had in such a manner for my children, and placed in such 
hands, that I was perfectly easy and satisfied they would 
have justice done them, whatever might befall me ; and foi 
their education, I left it wholly to the widow, with a suf- 
ficient maintenance to herself for her care : all which she 
richly deserved, for no mother could have taken more care 
in their education, or understood it better ; and as she lived 
till I came home, I also lived to thank her for it. 

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of Jan- 
uary 1694-5 ; and I, with my man Friday, went on board 
in the Downs the 8th ; having, besides that sloop which I 
mentioned above, a very considerable cargo of all kinds o. 
necessary things for my colony ; which, if I did not find in 
good condition, I resolved to leave so. 

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I proposed 
to place there as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there, 
apoc my account, while I stayed, and either to leave them 
there, or carry them forward, as they would appear willing : 
particularly, I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very 
handy, ingenious fellow, who was a cooper by trade, and 
ras also a general mechanic ; for he was dexterous at making 



146 ADVKNl'URES OP 

irheeis, &nd hand-mills to grind com, was a good tuTnet, 
and a good pot-maker ; he also made anything that wai 
proper to make of earth, or of wood ; in a word, we called 
him our Jack of all trades. With these I carried a tailor, 
who had offered himself to go % passenger to the East 
Indies with my nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on 
our new plantation ; and proved a most necessary, handy 
fellow as could be desired, in many other businesses besides 
that of his trade : for, as I observed formerly, necessity arms 
OS for all employments. 

My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I had not kept 
account of the particulars, consisted of a sufficient quantity 
of linen, and some English thin stuffs, for clothing the 
Spaniards that I expected to find there ; and enough of 
them, as, by my calculation, might comfortably supply them 
for seven years : if I remember right, the materials I carried 
for clothing them, with gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and 
all such things as they could want for wearing, amounted to 
abo\e two hundred pounds, including some beds, bedding, 
and household stuff, particularly kitchen utensils, with pots, 
kettles, pewter, brass, dtc, and near a hundred pounds more 
in iron work, nails, tools of every kind, staples, hooks, 
hinges, and every necessary thing I could think of. 

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and fusees ; 
besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all 
sizes, three or four tons of lead, and two pieces of brass 
cannon ; and because I knew not what time and what ex- 
tremities I was providing for, I carried a hundred barrels ol 
powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron part of some 
pikes and halberds : so that, in short, we had a large maga- 
zine of all sorts of stores : and I made my nophew carry 
Svo small quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his 
•hip, to leave behind if there was occasion ; that, when wo 
^me there, we might build a fort, and man it against all 
forts of enemies ; and, indeed, I at first ^bought there woul^

ke need enough for all, and much more, if we hciped a 
maintain our possession of the island ; as shi.ll be seen in 
the course of that story. 

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been 
used to meet with ; and therefore shall have tl*e less occa- 
sion to interrupt the reader, who perhaps may be impatient 
to hear how matters went with my colony : yet some old 
accidents, cross winds, and bad weather, happened on this 
first setting out, which made the voyage longer than I 
expected it at first : and I, who had never made but one 
voyage, viz., my first voyage to Guinea, in which I might be 
said to come back again as the voyage was at first designed, 
began to think the same ill fate attended me ; and that I 
was bom to be never contented with being on shore, and yet 
to be always unfortunate at sea. 

Contrary winHs first put us to the northward, and we 
were obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland, where we lay 
wind-bound two-and-twenty days ; but we had this satisfac- 
tion with the disaster, that provisions were here exceeding 
cheap, and in the utmost plenty ; so that while we lay here, 
we never touched the ship's stores, but rather added to them. 
Here, also ' ♦ook in several live hogs, and two cows, with 
their calves ; which I resolved, if I had a good passage, to 
put on shore in my island ; but we fonr.d occavion to dit^ mr

HAD CAUGHT FIRE. 

Wb set out on the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a 
Tery fair gale of wind for some days. As I remember, it 
might be about the 20th of February, in the evening late, 
when the mate, having the watch, came into the round- 
house, and told us he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun 
fixcii ; and while he was telling us of it, a boy came in, and 
told Ub the boatswain heard another. This made us all run 
out upon the quarter-deck, where, for a while, we heard 
nothing ; but in a few minutes we saw a very great light, 
and found that there was some very terrible fire at a distance ; 
immediately we had recourse to our reckonings, in which we 
all agreed that there could be no land that way in which the 
fire showed itself, no, not for five hundred leagues, for it 
appeared at W.N.W. Upon this we concluded it must be 
some ship on fire at sea ; and as, by our hearing the noise 
of guns just before, we concluded that it could not be far 
off, we stood directly towards it, and were presently satisfied 
we should discover it, because, the farther we sailed, the 
greater the light appeared ; though, the weather being hazy, 
we could not perceive anything but the light for a while. In 
about half an hour's sailing, the wind being fair for us, 
though not much of it, and the weather clearing up a little, 
we could plainly discern that it was a great ^hip on fijre, in 
the middle of the sea. 

I was most sensibly touched with this disastei, thougb 
not at all acquainted with the persons engaged in it: I 
presently recollected my former circumstances, and in what 
londition I was in, when taken up by the Portugue^jT

e8])tain ; and how much more deplorable the circumstancea 
of the poor creatures belonging to that ship must be, if the} 
had no other ship in company with them. Upon this, 1 
immediately ordered that five guns should be fired, one soon 
after another ; that, if possible, we might give notice to 
them that there was help for them at hand, and that they 
might endeavor to save themselves in their boat ; for though 
we could see the flames of the ship, yet they, it being night, 
could see nothing of us. 

We lay by for some time upon this, only driving as the 
burning ship drove, waiting for daylight; when, on a sudden, 
to our great terror, though we had reason to expect it, the 
ship blew up in the air ; and immediately, that is to say, in 
a few minutes, all the fire was out, that is to say, the rest of 
the ship sunk. This was a terrible and indeed an aflflicting 
wght, for the sake 0/ the poor men ; who I concluded, must 
be either all destroyed in the ship, or oe in the utmost dis- 
tress iu their boat, in the middle of the ocean ; which, at 
present, by reason it was dark, I could not see. However, 
to direct them as well as I could, I caused lights to be hung 
out in all parts of the ship where we could, and which we 
had lanterns for, and kept firing guns all the night long ; 
letting them know, by this, that there was a ship not far 
off. 

About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered the 
ship's boats by aid of our perspective glasses ; found there 
were two of them, both thronged with people, and deep in 
the water. We perceived they rowed, the wind being against 
iu*im ; tha* they saw our ship, and did their utmost to let ua 
see them. 

We immediately spread our ancient^ to let them know we 
saw them, and hung a waft out, as a signal for them to come 
on board ; and then made more sail, standing directly to 
them. In little more than half an hour we came up with 
lien ; and, in a word, took them all in, being no less than 
30 



|.)0 ADVENTURES OF 

•ixty-four men, women, and children ; for there were a grea. 
many passengers. 

Upon the whole, we found it was a French merchait-shi}- 
of three hundred tons, home-bound from Quebec, in th« 
river of Canada. The master gave us a long account of the 
distress of his ship ; how the fire began in the steerage, by 
the negligence of the steersman ; but on his crying out foi 
help, was as every body thought, entirely put out ; but they 
8i>on found that some sparks of the first fire had gotten into 
Eume part of the ship so difficult to ccjjpe at, that they coulJ 
not effectually quench it ; and afterwards getting in between 
the timbers, and within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded 
into the hold, and mastered all the skill and all the applica* 
tion they were able to exert. 

They had no more to do then, but to get into their boats 
which, to their great comfort, were pretty large ; being their 
long-boat, and their great shallop, besides a small skifif, 
which was of no great service to them, other than to get 
some fresh water and provisions into her, after they had 
secured their lives from the fire. They had, indeed, small 
hope of their lives by getting into these boats, at that dis- 
tance from any land ; only, as they said well, that they were 
escaped from the fire, and a possibility that some ship might 
happen to be at sea, and might take them in. They had 
sails, oars, and a compass ; and were preparing to make the 
best of their way back to Newfoundland, the wind blowing 
pretty fair, for it blew an easy gale at S.E. by E. They 
had as much provision and water as, with sparing it sc as tc 
be next door to starving, might support them about twelve 
days ; in which, if they had no bad weather, and no contrary 
winds, the captain said he hoped he might get to the Banks 
of Newfoundland, and might perhaps take some fish, tu 
•ustain them till they might go on shore. But there were 
BO many chances against them in all these cases, such a« 
itorms. ♦<) overset and founder them ; rains and cold, to

oenumb and perish their iimbs ; contrary winds, t} keep 
them out and starve them ; that it must have been next to 
miraculous if they had escaped. 

In the midst of their consternation, every one being hope- 
less and ready to despair, the captain, with tears in his eyes, 
told me they were on a sudden surprised with the joy ci 
hearing a gun fire, and after that four more ; these were the 
five guns which I caused to be fired at first seeing the light. 
This revived their hearts, and gave them the notice, which, 
as above, I desired it should, viz., that there was a ship at 
hand for their help. It was upon the hearing of these guns 
that they took down their masts and sails : the sound coming 
fi-om the windward, they resolved to lie by till morning. 
Some time after this, hearing no more guns, they fired three 
muskets, one a considerable while after another ; but these, 
the wind being contrary, we nevei heard. 

Some time after that again, they wore still more agreeably 
surprised with seeing our lights, and hearing the guns which, 
as I have said, I caused to be fired all the rest of the night : 
this set them to work with their oars, to keep their boats 
ahead, at least, that we might the sooner come up with 
them; and, at last, to their inexpressible joy, they found 
we saw them. 

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the 
strange ecstasies, the variety gf postures, which these poor 
delivered people ran into, to express the joy of their souls 
at so unexpected a deliverance. Grief and fear are easily 
described ; sighs, tears, groans, and very few motions of the 
head and hands, make up the sum of its variety ; but an 
excess of joy, a surprise of joy, has a thousand extravagancies 
in it : there were some in tears ; some raging and tearing 
themselves, as if they had been in the greatest agonies 01 
soirow ; some stark raving, and downright lunatic ; some 
ran about the ship stamping with their feet, others wringing 
their bancs ; some wer'? dancing, some singing, some laughing. 



552 ADVENTURES OF 

more trying ; many quite dumb, not able to qpeak a word 
otherfc sick and vomiting ; several swooning, and ready U 
faint ; and a few were crossing themselves, and giving Ooi 
thanks. 

I would not wrong them neither ; there might be many 
that were thankful afterwards, but the passion was too strong 
for them at first, and they were not able to master it : they 
were thrown in^o ecstasies, and a kind of frenzy ; and it was 
but a very few that were composed and serious in their joy. 

Perhaps, also, the case may have some addition to it from 
the particular circumstance of that nation they belonged to : 
I mean the French, whose temper is allowed to be more 
volatile, more passionate, and more sprightly, and their spirits 
more fluid, than in other nations. I am not philosopher 
enough to determine the cause ; but nothing I had ever seen 
before came up to it. The ecstasies poor Friday, my trusty 
savage, was in, when he found his father in the boat, came 
the nearest to it ; and the surprise of the master and his 
two companions, whom I delivered from the villains that set 
them on shore in the island, came a little way towards it ; 
but nothing was to compare to this, either that I saw in 
Friday, or anywhere else in my life. 

It is further observable, that these extravagances did not 
show themselves, in that different manner I have mentioned, 
in different perpons only ; but all the variety would appear, in 
a short sucession of moments, in one and the same person. 
A man that wo saw this minute dumb, and as it were stupid 
and confounded, would the next minute be dancing and 
ballooing like an antic ; and the next moment be tearing his 
hitir or pulling his clothes to pieces, and stamping them under 
his feet, like a madman ; in a few moments after that, we 
would have him all in tears, then sick, swooning, and, had 
not immediate help been had, he would in a few momenti 
have been dead ; and thus it was, not with one or two, oi 
ten CT twenty but with the greatest part of them : and if 1 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 35| 

remember rifjht, our surgeon was obliged to let blood oi 
about thirty of them. 

There were two priests among them, one an old man, and 
the other a young man ; and that which was strangest was, 
the oldest man was the worst. As soon as he set his foot 
on board our ship, and saw^himself safe, he dropped down 
■tone-dead, to all appearance ; not the least sign of life 
could be perceived in him : our surgeon immediately applied 
pr-jper remedies to recover him, and was the only man in the 
ship that believed he was not dead. At length he opened a 
vein in his arm, having first chafed and rubbed the part, so 
as to warm it as much as possible : upon this blood, which 
only dropped at first, flowing freely, in three minutes after 
the man opened his eyes ; and a quarter of an hour after that 
he spoke, grew better, and in a little time quite well. After 
the blood was stopped, he walked about ; told us he was 
perfectly well; took a dram of cordial which the surgeon 
gave him, and was what we called come to himself. About 
a quarter of an hour after this, they came running into the 
cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a French woman 
that had fainted, and told him the priest was gone stark 
mad. It seems he had begun to revolve the change of his 
circumstances in his mind, and again this put him into an 
ecstacy of joy ; his spirits whirled about faster than the 
vessels could convey them, the blood grew hot and feverish, 
and the man was as fit for Bedlam slb creature that ever wa* 
in it: the surgeon would not bleed him again in that condi- 
tion, but gave him something to doze and put him to sleep, 
which, after some time, operated upon him, and he awoke 
next morning perfectly composed and well. 

The yoimger priest behaved with great command of his 
passions, and was really an example of a serious, well 
governed mind : at his first coming on board the ship, he 
threw himseTf flat on his face, prostrating himself in thank- 
fulness fcT his deliverance, in which I unhappily an^

onseasonably disturbed him, really thinking he had been ir 
ft 8W00Q, but he spoke calmly, thanked me, told me he wai 
giving God thanks for his deliverance ; begged me to leave 
aim a fe^ noments, and that, next to Lis Maker, he would 
give me thanks also. 

I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not only 
left him, but kept others from interrupting him also. lie 
continued in that posture about^three minutes, or little more, 
after 1 left him ; then came to me, as he had said he would, 
an J, with a great deal of seriousness and affection, but with 
tears in his eyes, thanked me, that had, under God, given 
him, and so many miserable creatures, their lives. I told 
him I had no room to move him to thank God for it, rathei 
than me, for I had seen that he had done that already ; but, 
( added, that it was nothing but what reason and humanity 
dictated to all men ; and that we had as much reason as he 
to give thanks to God, who had blessed us so far, as to 
make us the instruments of his mercy to so many of his 
creatures. 

After this, the young priest applied himself to his country- 
folks ; labored to compose them ; persuaded, entreated 
argued, reasoned with them ; and did his utmost to keep 
them within the exercise of their reason ; and with some 
he had success, though others were for a time out of all 
government of themselves. 

I cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it 
may be useful to these into whose hands it may fall, for the 
guiding themselves in all the extravagances of their passions ; 
for if an excess of joy can carry men out to such a length 
beyond the reach of their reason, what will not the extrava- 
gances of anger, rage, and a provoked mind, carry us to ? 
And, ndeed, here I saw reason for keeping an exceeding 
watch over our passions of every kind, as well those of jcj 
Rnd satisfaction, as those of sorrow and anger. 

We were something disordered, by these extra\cigancei

aniong our new guests, for the first day ; but when they had 
teen retired, lodgings provided for them as well as our ship 
would allow, and they had^ slept heartily — as most ol 
ehem did, being fatigued and frightened — they were quite 
another sort of people the next day. 

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments for 
the kindness- shown them, was wanting ; the French, it i» 
known, are naturally apt enough to exceed that way. The 
eaptain and one of the priests, came to me t^e next day, and 
desired to speak with me and my nephew : the commandei 
began to consult with us what should be done with them ; 
and first, they told us that we had saved their lives, so all 
they had was little enough for a return to us for that 
kindness received. The captain said they had saved some 
money, and some things of value, in their boats, catched 
hastily out of the flames, and if we would accept it, they 
were ordered to make an off'er of It all to us: they only 
desired to be set on shore somewhere in our way, where, iJ 
possible, they might get a passage to France. My nephew 
was for accepting their money at first word, and to consider 
what to do with them afterwards ; but I overruled him in 
that pt&rt, for I knew what it was to be set on shore in b 
strange country; and if the Portuguese captain that took 
me up at sea had served me so, and took all I bad for my 
deliverance, I must have starved, or have been as much a 
slave at the Brazils as I had been at Barbary, the men 
being sold to a Mahometan excepted ; and perhaps a 
Portuguese is not a much better master than ^ Turk, 
if not, in some casts, much worse. 

I therefore told the French captain that we had taken 
them up in their distress, it was true, but that it was oui 
duty to do so, as we were fellow-creatures ; and we woiih) 
desire to be so delivered, if we were in the like, or anj 
other extrenuty; that we had done nothing for them but 
what we believed they wottid have done for is, if we ha4 



156 ADVENTURES OP 

been in their case, and they in ours ; but that we t:ok then 
up to save them, not to plunder them ; and it would be a 
most barbarous thing to take that little from them which 
they had saved out of the fire, and then set them on shore 
and leave them ; that this would be first to save them from 
death, and then kill them ourselves ; save them . from 
drowning, and abandon them to starving ; and therefore I 
would not let the least thing be taken from them. As to 
setting them on shore, I told them, indeed, that was an 
exceeding difficulty to us, for that the ship was bound 
to the East Indies ; and though we were driven out of our 
course to the westward a very great way, and perhaps were 
directed by Heaven on purpose •for their deliverance, yet i*. 
was impossible for us wilfully to change our voyage on theii 
particular account; nor could my nephew, the captain, 
answer it to the freighters, with whom he was under charter- 
party to pursue his voyage by the way of Brazil : and all J 
knew we could do for them, was to put ourselves in the way 
of meeting with other ships homeward bound from the West 
Indies, and get them a passage, if possible, to England oi 
France. 

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind, 
they could not but be very thankful for it ; but they were in 
a very great consternation, especially the passengers, at the 
notion of being carried away to the East Indies : they then 
entreated me, that seeing I was driven so far to the wesward 
before I met with them, I would at least keep on the same 
course lb the banks of Newfoundand, where it was probable 
I might meet with some ship or sloop that they might hire 
to carry them back to Canada, from whence they came. 

I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part, 
and therefore I inclined to agree to it ; for, indeed, I oon- 
iidered , that to carry this whole company to the East Indies 
would not only be an intolerable severity upon the pooi 
^fle, but would be ruining oiur whole eoyage, by devour

ing f.J our provisions ; so I thought it no breach of chaiter* 
party, but what an unforeseen accident made jibsoluteit 
necessary to us, and in which no one could say we were to 
blame : for the laws of God and nature would have forbid 
that we would refuse to take up two boats* full of people in 
such a distressed condition ; and the nature of the thing, as 
well respecting ourselves as the poor people, obliged us to 
•et them on shore somewhere or other for their deliverance : 
■o I consented that we would carry them to Newfoundland, 
'f wind and weather would permit ; and if not, that I would 
carry them to Martinico, in the West Indies. 



SECTION XX.XIl. 

EBLIBVB8 THE CREW OP A BRISTOL SHIP, WHO ABE STARVIHO — 
ARRIVES AT HI8 ISLAND. 

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty 
good ; and as the winds had continued in the points between 
N.E. and S.E. a long time, we missed several opportunities 
of sending them to France ; for we met several ships bound 
to Europe, whereof two were French, from St. Christo- 
pher's; but they had been so long beating up against the 
wind, that they durst take in no passengers, for fear ol 
wanting provisions for the voyage, as well for themselves as 
for those they should take in ; so we were obliged to go on. 
It was about a week after this that we made the Banks ol 
Newfoundland ; where, to shorten my story, we put all our 
French people on board a bark, which they hired at sea 
there, to put them on shore, and afterwards to carry them to 
France, if they could get provisions to victual themselvei 
with. Wlien I say all the French went on shore. I should

remember, that the }oung priest I spoke v>f, heaiing ^m 
were bound to the East Indies, desired to go the voyage witD 
us, and to be set on shore on iLe coast of Coromandel; 
which I readily agreed to, for I wonderfully liked the man, 
and had very good reason, as will appear afterwards : also 
four of the seamen entered themselves on our ship, and 
proved very useful fellows. 

From hence we directed our course to the West Indies, 
steering away S. and S. by E. for about twenty days 
together, sometimes little or no wind at all ; when we met 
with another subject for our humanity to work upon, almost 
as deplorable as that before. 

It was in the latitude of twenty-seven degrees h\e 
minutes north, on the 19th day of March, 1694-5, when we 
?piod a sail, our course S.E. and by S. : we soon perceived 
it was a large vessel, and that she bore up to us, but could 
not at first know what to make of her, till, after coming 
a little nearer, we found she had lost her main topmast 
foremast, and bowsprit ; and presently she fired a gun, as 
a signal of distress : the weather was pretty good, wind at 
N.N.W., a fresh gale, and we soon came to speak 
v/ith her. 

We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from Bar- 
badoes, but had been blown out of the road at Barbadoes a 
few days before she was ready to sail, by a terrible hurri- 
cane, while the captain and chief mate were both gone on 
shore; so that, besides the terror of the storm, they were 
in an indifferent case for good artists to bring the ship home. 
They had been already nine weeks at sea, and had met with 
another terrible storm, after the hurricane was over, which 
had blown them quite out of their knowledge to the west- 
ward, ami in which they lost their masts, as above. They 
told us they expected to have seen the Bahama islands, but 
were then driven away again to the south-east, by a strong 
jale of wind at N.N.W., the same that blew now: xn^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 559 

having no sails to work the ship with but a mainc% ui^e, and 
A kiiid of square sail upon a jury foremast, which they had 
»et up, they could not lie near the wind, but were endeavor*- 
ing to stand away for the Canaries. 

But that which was worst of all was, that they were 
almost starved for want of provisions, besides the fatigues 
they had undergone : their bread and flesh were quite gone ; 
they had not one ounce left in the ship, and had none for 
eleven days. The only relief they had was, their water was 
not all spent, and they had about half a barrel of flour left : 
they had sugar enough : some succades, or sweetmeats, they 
had at first, but they were devoured ; and they had seven 
casks of rum. 

There were a youth and his mother, and a maid-servant, 
on board, who were going passengers, and thinking the ship 
was ready to sail, unhappily came on board the evening 
before the hurricane began ; and having no provisions of 
their own left, they were in a more deplorable condition 
.han the rest : for the seamen, being reduced to such an 
3xtreme necessity themselves, had no compassion, we may 
be sure, for the poor passengers : and they were, indeed, in 
a condition, that their misery is very hard to describe. 

1 had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had 
not led me (the weather being fair, and the wind abated) to 
go on board the ship. The second mate, who, upon this 
occasion, commanded the ship, had been on board our ship, 
and he told me, indeed, they had three passengers in the 
great cabin, that were in a deplorable condition : Nay, says 
he, I believe they are dead, ftr I have heard nothing of 
them for above two days ; and I was afraid to enquire after 
them, said he, for 1 had nothing to relieve them with. 

We immediately applied ourselves to give them what 
telief we could spare ; and, indeed, I had so far overruled 
things with my nephew, that I would have victualled them, 
iLough we had gone away to Virgini», or any other part o 



»Q0 ADVENTUEES OF 

the coust of America, to have supplied ourselvet but then 
was no necessity for that. 

But HOW they were in a new danger ; for they were afiaid 
of eating too much, even of that little we gave Inem. The 
mate or commander brought six men with him in his boat ; 
but these poor wretches looked like skeletons, and were so 
weak, that they could hardly sit to their oars. The mate 
himself was very ill, and half-starved ; for he declared he 
had reserved nothing from the men, and went share and 
share alike with them in every bit they ate. 

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat before him 
immediately ; and he had not eaten three mouthfuls before 
he began to be sick, and out of order; so he stopped 
awhile, and our surgeon mixed him up something with some 
broth, which he said would be to him both food and physic ; 
aud after he had taken it, he grew better. In the mean 
time, I forgot not the men; I ordered victuals to be given 
them ; and the poor creatures rather devoured than ate it : 
they were so exceedingly hungry, that they were in a kind 
ravenous, and had no command of themselves ; and two ol 
them ate with so much greediness, that they were in danger 
of their lives the next morning. 

The sight of these people's distress was very moving to 
me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible prospect ol 
at my first coming on shore in my island, where I had never 
the least mouthful of food, or any prospect of procuring 
any ; besides the hourly apprehensions I had of ! eing made 
the food of other creatures. But all the while tit mate was 
thus relating to me the miserable condition of the ship's 
company, I could not put out of my thought the story he 
had told me of the three poor creatures in the great cabin. 
viz., the mother, her son, and the maid-servant, whom ha 
\iad heard nothing of for two or three days, and whom, he 
•eemed to confess, they had wholly neglected, their own 
extremities being so great : by which I understood that thej 



KOBINSON CRUSOB. 36] 

bad really given them no food at all, and that therefore, they 
must he perished, and he all lying dead, perhaps, on the 
tioor or deck of the cahin. 

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called 
captain, on board with his men to refresh them, so I also 
forgot not the starring crew that were left on board ; but 
ordered my own boat to go on board the ship, and with my 
mate and twelve men, to carry them a sack of bread, and 
four or five pieces of beef to boil. Our surgeon charged the 
men to cause the meat to be boiled while they stayed, and 
to keep guard in the cook-room to prevent the men taking i1 
to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot before it was web 
boiled, and then to give every man but a very little at a 
time : and by this caution he preserved the men, who would 
otherwise have killed themselves with that very food that 
was given them on purpose to save their lives. 

At the same time, I ordered the mate to go into the great 
tjdbin, and see what condition the poor passengers were in ; 
and if they were alive, to comfort them, and give them what 
refreshment was proper : and the surgeon gave him a large 
pitcher, with some of the prepared brotli which he had 
given the mate that was on board, and which he did not 
question would restore them gradually. 

I was not satisfied with this ; but, as I said above, 
having a great mind to see the scene of misery which I 
knew the ship itself would present me with, in a more 
lively manner than I could have it by report, I took the 
captain of the ship, as we now called him, with me, and 
went myself, a little after, in their boat. 

I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult, to ge* 
the victuals out of the boiler before it was ready ; but my 
mate observed his orders, and kept a good guard at the cook- 
room door ; and the man he placed there, after using all 
popsible persuasion to have p\tience, kept them off hy 
^ree : however he caused some biscuit-cakes to be dipped 
31

In the pot, and softened with the liquor of the meat, whicl 
they called brewis, and gave them every one some, to sta) 
their stomachs, and told them it was for their own safety 
that he was obliged to give them but little at a time. But 
it was all in vain ; and had I not come on board, and theii 
own commander and officers with me, and with good words, 
and some threats also of giving them no more, I believe 
they would have broken into the cook-room by force, and 
torn the meat out of the furnace ; for words are indeed of 
vfTy small force to a hungry belly : however, we pacified 
them, and fed them gradually and cautiously for the first, 
and the next time gave them more, and at last we filled theii 
bellies, and the men tUd well enough. 

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was 
of another nature, and far beyond the rest ; for as the ship's 
company had so little for themselves, it was but too true 
ehat they had at first kept them very low, and at last totally 
ueglected them ; so that for six or seven days it might be 
said they had really no food at all, and for several days 
oefore very little. The poor mother, who, as the men re- 
ported, was a woman of sense and good breeding, had spared 
xll she could so affectionately for her son, that at last she 
entirely sunk under it ; and when the mate of our ship went 
m, she sat upon the floor or deck, with her back up against 
the sides, between two chairs, which were lashed fast, and 
aer head sunk between her shoulders, like a corpse, though 
not quite dead. My mate said all he could to revive and 
rncourage her, and with a spoon put some broth into her 
mouth. She opened her lips, and lifted up one hand, but 
could not speak ; yet she understood what he said, and 
made signs to him, intimating that it was too late for her, 
put Dointed to her child, as if she Tcrild have said the^ 
ihould t:ike care of him. Howevei, the mate, who wai 
exceedingly moved with the sight, endeavored to get somt 
of the broth into her mouth, and. as he said got two oi 



ROBINSON CRJSOE. 36| 

three spoonfuls down ; though I question whetl er he could 
be sure of it or not : but it was too late, and she died the 
«ame night. 

The youth, who was preserved at the piice of his most 
•affectionate nr jther's life, was not so far gone ; yet he lay in 
/cabin-bed, as one stretched out, with hardly any life left 
D him. He had a piece of an old glove in his mouth, 
lavmg eaten up the rest of it: however, being young, and 
iaving more strength than his mother, the mate got some- 
hing down his throat, and he began sensibly to revive ; 
hough by giving him, some time after, but two or three 
•poonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and brought it up 
igain. 

But the next care was the poor maid : she lay all along 
upon the deck, hard by her mistress, and just like one that 
had fallen down with an apoplexy, and struggled for life. 
Her limbs were distorted ; one of her hands was clasped 
round the &ame of a chair, and she griped it so hard, that 
we could not easily make her let it go : her other arm lay 
over her head, and her feet lay both together, set fast 
against the frame of the cabin-table : in short, she lay just 
like one in the agonies of death, and yet she was alive too. 

The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, and 
terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as the men told u« 
afterwards, was broken-hearted for her mistress, whom she 
saw dying for two or three days before, and whom she loved 
most tenderly. 

We knew not what to do with this poor girl ; for wheB 
uur surgeon, who was a man of very great know''edge and 
experience, had with great application recovered her as tc 
life, he had her upon his hands as to her senses ; for she wa» 
little less than distracted for a considerable time after, at 
shall appear presently.

couiitrj*, where sometimes people stay a ♦veek or a.fonii'gk 
at a place : our business was U relieve this distressed ship^i 
crew, but not lie by for them ; and though they were willing 
to steer the same course with us for some days, yet we could 
carry no sail, to keep pace with a ship that had no masts . 
however, as their captain begged of us to help him to set up 
a main topmast, and a kind of topmast to his jury foremast, 
we did, as it were, lie by him for three or four days ;^nd 
then having given him five barrels of beef, a barrel of pork, 
two hogsheads of biscuit, and a proportion of peas, flour, 
and what other things we could spare ; and taking three 
CAsks of sugar, some rum, and some pieces of eight from 
them for satisfaction, we left them ; taking on board with 
us, at their own earnest request, the youth and the maid, 
and all their goods. 

The young lad was about seventeen years of age; a 
pretty, wejl bred, modest, and sensible youth, greatly de 
jected with the loss of his mother, and, as it seems, had los* 
his father but a few months before, at Barbadoes : he begged 
of the surgeon to speak to me to take him out of the ship ; 
for he said the cruel fellews had murdered his mother ; and, 
indeed, so they had, that is to say passively ; for they might 
have spired a small sustenance to the poor helpless widow 
that might have preserved her life, though it had been bul 
just enough to keep her alive : but hunger knows no friend, 
no relation, no justice, no right ; and therefore is remorse- 
less, and capable of no compassion. 

The surgeon told him how far we w^ere going, and that ii 
would carry him away from all his friends, and put him per- 
haps in as bad circumstances almost as those we found him 
in, that is to say, star\4ng in the world. He said it mattered 
not whither he .went, if he was but delivered from the teni- 
Sle crew that he was among ; that the captain (by which ht 
meant me, for he could know nothing of my nephew) had 
laved his life, and he was sure would not hurt him ; and at 



ROBINSON CRUSOE $61 

Ibr the maid, he was sure, if she came to herself, she wJuld 
be very thankful for it, let us carry them where we would. 
The surgeon represented the case so affectionately to me^ 
that I yielded, and we took them both on board, with all 
their goods, except eleven hogsheads of sugar, which cccdd 
not be removed or come at ; and as the youth had a bill ol 
lading for them, I made his commander sign a writing, 
obliging himself to go, as soon as he came to Bristol, to one 
Mr. Rogers, a merchant there, to whom the youth said he 
was related, and to deliver a letter which I wrote to him, 
and all the goods he had belonging to the deceased widow ; 
which I suppose was not done, for I could never learn that 
the ship came to Bristol, but was, as it is most probable, 
lost at sea; being in so disabled a condition, and so far 
from any land, that I am of opinion the first storm 9he 
met with afterwards she might founder in the sea ; for 
she was leaky and had damage in her hold, when we met 
with her. 

I was now in the latitude of nineteen degrees thirty-two 
minutes, and had hitherto a tolerable voyage as to weather, 
though, at first, the winds had been contrary. I shall 
trouble nobody with the little incidents of wind, weather, 
currents, dtc, on the rest of our voyage ; but to shorten my 
story, for the sake of what is to follow, shall observe, that I 
came to my old habitation, the "island, on the 10th of April, 
1695. It was with no small difficulty that I found the 
place ; for as I came to it, and went from it, before, on the 
south and east side of the island, as coming from the Bra- 
bUs, so now, coming in between the main and the island, 
*nd having no chart for the coast, nor any landmark, I 
did not know it when I saw it, or know whether I saw it cr 
not. 

We beat about a great while, and went on shore on 
several islands in the mouth of the great river Oronoco, but 
none for my purpose ; only this I learned by my coasting 
31* 



166 advbnturks of 

Ihe shore, that I was under one great mistake hefoie, vis , 
that the continent which I thought I saw from the island I 
lived in, was really not continent, but a long island, of 
rather a ridge of islands, reaching from one to the other 
side of the extended mouth of that great river ; and that the 
savages who came to my island were not properly thotve 
which we call Caribbees, but islanders, and other barbaxians 
of the same kind, who inhabited something nearer to our 
side than the rest. 

In short, I visited several of these islands to no purpose ; 
some I found were inhabited, and some were not : on one ol 
them I found some Spaniards, and thought they had lived 
there ; but speaking with them, found they had a sloop lay 
in a small creek hard by, and came thither to make salt and 
to catch some pearl muscles, if they could ; but that they 
belonged to the Isle de Trinidad, which lay farther north, in 
the latitude of ten and eleven degrees. 

Thus coasting from one island to another, sometimes with 
the ship, sometimes with the Frenchman's shallop, which we 
had found a convenient boat, and therefor^ kept her with 
their very good will, at length I came fair on the south side 
of my island, and presently knew the very countenance of 
the place : so I brought the ship safe to an anchor, bioadsidt 
with the little creek where my old habitation irat.

As soon as I saw the place. I called for Friday, and asked 
him if he knew where he was ; he looked about a little, and 
presently clapping his hands, cried, yes, there, O yes, 
O there, pointing to our old habitation, and fell dancing and 
capering like a mad fellow ; and I had much ado to keep 
him from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore to the place. 
Well, Friday, says I, do you think we shall find any body 
here or no ? and do you tL.nk we shall see your father ? 
The fellow stood mute as a stock a good while, but when I 
named his father, the poor affectionate creature looked 
dejected, and I could see the tears run down his face very 
plentifully. What is the matter, Friday ? says I ; are you 
troubled because you may see your father ! No, no, says he, 
shaking his head, no see him more : no, never more see him 
again. Why so, said I, Friday ? how do you know that ? 
O no, O no, says Friday ; he long ago die, long ago ; he 
much old man. Well, well, says I, Friday, you don't know ; 
but shall we see any one else, then ? The fellow, it seems, 
had better eyes than I, and he points to the hill just above 
my old house ; and though we lay half a league off, he crie« 
out. We see, we see, yes, yes, we see much man there, and 
there, and there. I looked, but I saw nobody, no, not with 
a perspective glass, which was, I suppose, because I could 
not hit the place ; for the fellow was right, as I found upon 
inquiry the next day ; and there were five or six men all 
together, who stood to look at the ship, not knowing wha' 
►o think of us. 



5($8 ADVENTURES OF 

As soon as Friday told us he saw people, I caused th« 
English anient to be spread, and fired throe guns, to givd 
them notice we were friends ; and in about half a quarte? 
of an hour after, \ie perceived a smoke arise from the side 
of the creek ; so I immediately ordered the boat out, taking 
Friday with me ; and hanging out a white flag, or a flag oi 
truce, I went directly on shore, taking with me the youilg 
friar I mentioned, to whom I had told the story of my living 
there, and the manner of it, and every particular both of 
myself and those I left there ; and who was, on that ac- 
count, extremely desirous to go with me. We had besides 
about sixteen men well armed, if we had found any new 
guests there which we did not know of; but we had no need 
of weapons. 

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near high 
water, we rowed directly into the creek ; and the first man I 
fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard whose life I had saved, 
and whom I knew by his face perfectly well : as to his habit, 
I shall describe it afterwards. I ordered nobody to go on 
shore at first but myself ; but there was no keeping Friday 
in the boat, fdr the aflectionate creature had spied his father 
at a distance, a good way off the Spaniards, where indeed I 
saw nothing of him ; and if they had not let him go ashore, 
he would have jumped into the sea. He was no sooner on 
shore, but he flew away to his father, like an arrow out of a 
bow. It would have made any man shed tears, in spite of 
the firmest resolution, to have seen the first transports of thij 
poor fellow's joy when he came to his father : how he em- 
braced him, kissed him, stroked his face, took him up in his 
arms, set him down upon a tree, and lay down by him ; 
then stood and looked at him, as any one would look at a 
«trange picture, for a quarter of an hour together ; then lay 
down on the ground, and stroked his legs, and kissed them, 
and then g Dt up again, and stared at him ; one would hava

FRIDAY AND HIS FATHER

log laugh the next day to see how his passion ran out 
another way ; in the morning he walked along the shore, 
to and again, with his father several hours, always leading 
him by the hand, as if he had been a lady ; and every now 
wid then he would come to the boat to fetch something or 
ether for him, either a lump of sugar, a dram, a biscuit- 
cake, or something or other that was good. In the aftemoon* 
his frolics ran another way ; for then he would set the old 
man down upon the ground and dance about him, and make 
a thousand antic postures and gestures ; and all the while 
he did this, he would be talking to him, and telling him one 
story or other of his travels, and of what had happened to 
him abroad, to divert him. In short, if the same filial afiec- 
tion was to be found in Christians to their parents in our 
part of the world, one would be tempted to say, there would 
hardly have been any need of the fifth commandment. 

But this is a digression: I return to my landing. It 
would be needless to take notice of all the ceremonies and 
civilities that the Spaniards received me with. The first 
Spaniard, who, as I said, I knew very well, was he whose 
life I had saved : he came towards the boat, attended by 
one more, carrying a flag of truce also ; and he not only did 
not know me at first, but he had no thoughts, no notion ol 
its being me that was come, till I spoke to him. Senhor, 
said I, in Portuguese, do you not know me ? At which he 
spoke not a word, but giving his musket to the man that 
was with him, threw his arms abroad, sajing something in 
Spanish that I did not perfectly hear, came forward and 
embraced me ; telling me he was inexcusable not to knovt 
that face again, that he had once seen as if an angel from 
heaven sent to save his life : he said abundance of very 
handsome things, as a well-bred Spaniard always knowa 
Qow ; and then beckoning to the person that attended him, 
bade him go and call out his comrades. He then asked me 
rf I v% >uld walk to my old habitation, where ne would giv« 



570 advknturks of 

me possession of my own house agaii*, and wbeie 1 sL mid 
see they had made but mean improvements : so I walked 
along with him ; but, alas ! I could no more find the place 
again than if I had never been there ; for they had planted 
to many trees, and placed them in such a posture, so thick 
and close to one another, and in ten years* time they were 
grown so big, that, in short, the place was inaccessible, 
eicept by such windings and blind ways as they themselvet 
only, who made them, could find. 

I asked them what put them upon all these fortifications : 
he told me I would say there was need enough of it, when 
the} had given me an account how they had passed their 
time since their arriving in the island, especially after they 
had the misfortune to find that I was gone. He told me 
he could*not but have some satisfaction in my good fortune, 
when he heard that I was gone in a good ship, and to my 
satisfaction ; and that he had oflentimes a strong persuasion 
that, one time or other, he* should see me again ; but nothing 
that ever befel him in his life, he said, was so surprising and 
afflicting to him at first, as the disappointment he was under 
when he came back to the island and found I was not there. 
As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were 
ieft behind, and of whom, he said, he had a long story to 
tell me, the Spaniards all thought themselves much better 
among the savages, only that their number was so small ; 
and, says he, had they been strong enough, we had been 
long ago in purgatory ; and with that he crossed himself on 
the breast. But, sir, says he, I hope you will not be dis- 
pleased when I shall tell you how, forced by necessity, we 
were obliged, for our own preservation, to disarm them, and 
make them our subjects, who would not be content with 
being moderately our masters, but would be our murderers. 
I answered I was heartily afraid of it when I left then 
here, and nothing troubled me at my parting from tli«

t^^and but that they were not come back, that I niglit havt 
put them in possession of everything first, and left the others 
ill a state of subjection, as they deserved ; but if they bad 
reduced them to it, I \Yas very glad, and should be very fai 
^om finding any fault with it ; for I knew they were a parcel 
of refractory, ungovemed villains, and were fit for any man* 
nsr of mischief. 

^\^lile I was thus saying this, the man came whom he had 
*€nt back, and with him eleven men more. In the dresfl 
5hey were in, it was impossible to guess what nation they 
jrereof ; but he made all clear, both to them and me. Firsi 
le turned to me, and pointing to them, said. These, sir, are 
ome of the gentlemen who owe their lives to you ; and 
hen turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them know 
vho I was ; upon which they all came up, one by one, not 
•s if they had been sailors and ordinary fellows, and the 
like, but really as if they had been ambassadors of noble- 
men, and I a monarch or great conqueror : their behavior 
was to the last degree obliging and courteous, and yet mixed 
with a manly, majestic gravity, which very well became 
them ; and, in short, they had so much more manners than 
I, that 1 scarce knew how to receive their civilities, much 
iess how to return them in kind. 

The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the island, 
after my going away, is so very remarkable, and has so many 
incidents, which the former part of my relation will help to 
understand, and which will, in most ^f the particulars, refei 
to the account 1 have already given, that I cannot but 
Vmmit them, with great delight to the reading of those that 
come after me. 

1 shall no longer trouble the story With a relation in the 
first person, which will put me to the expense of ten thcu-

\im f, and thr like ; but I shall collect the 'acts his <orically. 



372 ADVENTX3UES OF 

18 near is I can gather tUem out of my memory, from wh& 
ihey itlated to me, and from what I met with in my con? 
versing with them and with the place. 

In order to do this suc( inctly, and as intelligibly as I c«in, 
I must go back to the circumstances in which I left the 
island, and in which the persons were of whom I am tj 
speak. And first, it is necessary to repeat, that I had sent 
away Friday's father and the Spaniard (the two whose lives 
I had rescued from the savages) in a large canoe, to the 
main, as I then thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard*8 
companions that he left behind him, in order to save them 
from the like calamity that he had been in, and in order 
to succor them for the present ; and that, if possible » 
we might together find some way for our deliverance after 
wards. 

When I sent them away, I had no visible appearance ot 
ur the least room to hope for, my own deliverance, any more 
than I had twenty years before ; much less had I any fore- 
knowledge of what afterwards happened, I mean, of an 
English ship coming on shore there to fetch me off; and it 
could not but be a very great surprise to ' them, when they 
came back, not only to find that I was gone, but to find 
three otrangers left on the spot, possessed of all that 1 
had left behind me, which woidd otherwise have been their 
own. 

The first thing, however, that I inquired into, that I might 
Login where I left off,^as of their own part ; and I desired 
he would give me a particular account of his voyage back to 
his countrymen with the boat, when I sent him to fetch 
ihem over. He told me there was little variety in that 
part, for nothing remarkable happened to them on the ^ay, 
hanng had very calm weather and a smooth sea. As foi 
his t»untrymen, it could not be doubted, he said, but that 
they were overj ) ed to see him (it seems he was the prin- 
tipal man among them, the capudn of the vessel they ha<) 



ROBINSON CEUSOE. $f^ 

been shipwrecked in having been dead some rim^) ; they 
▼ere, he said, the more surprised to see him, because they 
knew that he was fallen into the hands of the savages, who, 
they were satisfied, would devour him, as they did all the 
jest of their prisoners ; that when he told them the story oi 
his deliverance, and in what manner he was furnished for 
carrying them away, it was like a dream to them, and their 
astonishment, he said, was somewhat like that of Joseph's 
biethren, when he told them who he was, and told them the 
itory of his exaltation in Pharuoh's court ; but when he 
showed them the arms, the powder, the ball, and provisions, 
that he brought them for their journey or voyage, they were 
restored to themselves, took a just share of the joy of their 
deliverance, and immediately prepared to come away with 
him. 

Their first business was to get canoes : and in this they 
were obliged not to stick so much upon the honest part oi 
It, but to trespass upon their friendly savages, and to borrow 
two large canoes, or periaguas, on pretence of going out a 
fishing, or for pleasure. In these they came away the next 
morning. It seems they wanted no time to get themselves 
ready ; for they had no baggage, neither clothes, nor provis- 
ions, nor anything in the world but what they had on them, 
and a few roots to eat, of which they used to make theii 
bread. 

They were in all three weeks absent ; and in that time, 
unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered for my escape 
as I mentioned in my other part, and to get off from the 
island, leaving three of the most impudent, hardened ungov- 
erned, disagreeable villains behind me, that any man could 
desire to meet with ; to the poor Spaniards* great grief and 
disappointment, you may be sure. 

The only just thing the rogues did was, that when the 
Spaniards came ashore, they gave my letter to them, and 
^ave thenr provisions, and other relief, as I ha J. ordered their 
32 



574 ADVENTURES OP 

to do ; also tiiey gdve them the long paper of directions whicb 
L had left witli them, containing^ the particular methpdi 
which I toci for managing every part of my life there ; the 
way how 1 baked my bread, bred up my tame goats, ard 
planted my corn ; how I cured my grapes, made my poti, 
and in a word, everything I did ; all this being written 
down, they gave to the Spaniards (two of them understood 
English well enough) : nor did they refuse to accommodate 
the Spaniards with anything else, for they agreed very well 
*br «ome time. They gave them an equal admission into the 
house, or cave, and they began to live very sociably ; and 
the head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my methods, 
and Friday's father together, managed all their affairs : but 
as for the Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble about 
the island, shoot parrots, and catch tortoises ; and whrn 
they came home at night, the Spaniards provided their sup- 
pers for them. 

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this, had 
the others but let them alone ; which, however, they could 
not find in their hearts to do long, but, like the dog in the 
manger, they would not eat themselves, neither would they 
let the others eat. The differences, nevertheless, were at 
first but trivial, and such as are not worth relating, but at 
last it broke out into open war : and it began with all the 
rudeness and insolence that can be imagined, without reason, 
without provocation, contrary to nature, and, indeed, to 
common sense ; and though, it is true, the first relation oi 
:t came fi*om the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the 
accusers, yet when I came to examine the follows, they could 
not deny a word of it. 

But before I come to the particulars of this part, I must 
lapplj a defect in my former relation ; and this was, I forgot 
to set down, among the rest, that just as we were weighing 
the anchor to set sail, there happened a little quar.-el on 
board of o ir ship, wh-:5h I was once afraid would havt 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 37* 

fjtned to a second mutiny; nor was it appeased till th« 
laptain, rousing up his courage, and taking us all to iiu 
assistance, parted them by force, and making two of tne 
most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in irons ; and 
as they had been active in the former disorders, and let fal3 
some ugly, dangerous words, the second time he threaten'».d 
to carry them in irons to England, and have them hanged 
there for mutiny, and running away with the ship. This, it 
■eems, though the captain did not intend to do it, frightened 
some other men in the ship ; and some of them had put it 
into the heads of the rest that the captain only gave them 
good words for the present, till they should come to some 
English port, and that then they should be all put into goal 
and tried for their lives. The mate got intelligence of this, 
and acquainted us with it ; upon which it was desired that 
I, who still passed for a great man among them, should go 
down with the mate, and satisfy the men, and tell them that 
they might be assured, if they behaved well the rest of the 
voyage, all they had done for the time past should be 
pardoned. So I went, and after passing my honor's word 
to them, they appeared easy, and the more so when I caused 
the two men that were in irons to be released and forgiven. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that 
night ; the wind also falling calm next morning, we found 
that our two men who had been laid in irons had stole each 
of them a musket, and some other weapons (what powder or 
shot they had we knew not), and had taken the ship's pin- 
nace, which was not yet hauled up, and run away with her 
to their companions in roguery on shore. As soon as we 
found this, I ordered the long-boat on shore, \vith twelve 
men and the mate, and away they went to seek the rogues ; 
but they could neither find them or any of the rest, for they 
til fled into the woods when they saw the boat coming on 
inore. The mate was once resolved, in justice to theii 
tog lery to have destroyed their plantations, burned all tbeii 



576 ADVENTURES OF 

household stuff and furniture, and left them to shift withou 
It , but having no orders, he let it all alone, left everything 
as he found it, and bringing the pinnace away, came on 
board without them. These two men made their number 
five ; but the other three villains were so much more wicked 
than they, that after they had been two or three dayp 
together, they turned the two new comers out of doors tc 
shift for themselves, and would have nothing to do with 
them ; nor could they, for a good while, be persuaded to 
give them any food : as for the Spaniards, they were not yet 
'iome. 

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the business, 
began to go forward : the Spaniards would have persuaded 
the three English brutes to have taken in their two country- 
men again, that, as they said, they might be all one family ; 
but they would not hear of it ; so the two poor fellows liveii 
by themselves ; and finding nothing but industry and appli 
cation would make them live comfortably, they pitched theii 
tents on the north shore of the island, but a little more to 
the west, to be out of danger of the savages, who always 
landed on the east parts of the island. 

Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in, and the 
o*her to lay up their magazines and stores in ; and the 
Spaniards having given them some corn for seed, and 
especially some of the peas which I had left them, they dug, 
planted, and enclosed, after the pattern 1 had set for them 
ill, and began to live pretty well. Their first crop of corn 
was on the ground ; and though it was but a little bit ol 
land which they had dug up at first, having had but a little 
lime, yet it was enough to relieve them, and find them with 
bread and other eatables ; and one of the fellows, being the 
cook's mate of the ship, was very ready at making soup, 
puddiags, and such other preparations as the rice and th^ 
milk, md such little flesl as they g-^t, furnished him ^o dp>.

They were going on in this little thriving posture, when 
the three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in 
mere humor, ^d to insult them, came and bullied them, 
»nd told them the island was theirs; that the governor, 
meaning me, had given them the possession of it, and 
nobody else had any right to it ; and that they should build 
no houses upon their ground, unless they woul I pay rent fo" 
them. 

The two men, thinking they were jesting at first, asked 
them to come in and sit down, and see what fine houses 
they were that they had built, and to tell them what rent 
they demanded ; and one of them merrily said, if they were 
the ground-landlords, he hoped, if they built tenements 
upon their land, and made improvements, they would, 
according to the custom of landlords, grant a long lease ; 
and desired they would get a scrivener to draw the writings. 
One of the three, cursing and raging, told them they should 
see they were not in jest ; and going to a little place at a 
distance, where the honest men had made a fire to dress 
their victuals, he takes a firebrand, and claps it to the out* 
side of their hut, and very fairly set it on fire ; and it would 
have been burned all down in a few minutes, if one of the 
t\*o had not run to the fellow, thrust him away^ and trod 
tne fire out with his feet, and that not without some diffi- 
nulty too. 

The fuUow was in such a rage at the honest mans thrust- 
5ag L*m awxy, that he returned upon him, \^nth a pole hi

oad in his bind, and had not the man avc ided the blow yerj 
nimbly, and run into the hut, he had ended his days at once 
His comrade, seeing the danger they were both in, ran in 
after him, and immediately they came both out with theii 
muskets, and the man that was first struck at with the pole 
knocked the fellow down that had begun the quarrel with 
the stock of his musket, and that before the other two could 
come to help him ; and then seeing the rest come at them, 
diey stood together, and presenting the other ends of theii 
pieces to them, bade them stand off. 

The others had fire-arms with them too ; 1)ut one of the 
two honest men, bolder than his comrade, and made des- 
perate by his danger, told them, if they offered to move 
aand or foot they were dead men, and boldly commanded 
liiem to lay down their arms. They did not, indeed, lay 
down their arms, but seeing him so resolute, it brought 
them to a parley, and they consented to take their wounded 
man with them and be gone ; and, indeed, it <»eems the 
fellow was wounded sufliciently with the blow. However, 
they were much in the wrong, since they had the advantage, 
that they did not disarm them effectually, as they might 
have done, and have gone immediately to the Spaniards, and 
given them an account how the rogues had treated them ; 
for the three villains studied nothing but revenge, and every 
day gave them some intimation that they did so. 

But not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser 
part of the rogueries, such as treading down their com, 
shooting three young kids and a she-goat, which the |>ooi 
men had got to breed up tame for their store ; and, in a 
word, plaguing them night and day in this manner ; it 
forced the two men to such a desperation, that they resohed 
to fight them all three, the first time they had a fair opportu- 
nity. In 01 der to this, they resolved to go to the castle, as 
they oalled it (that was my old dwelling), where the tnref 
rogues and the Spaniards all lived together at that time^ 



UOBINSON CRUSOE. 371 

iiil( ling to have a fair battle, and the Spaniards should 
Bt:nd by to see fair play : so they got up in the morning 
before day, and came to the place, and called the English- 
men by their names, telling a Spaniard that answered thai 
they wanted to speak with them. 

It happened that the day before, two of the Spaniards, 
having been in the woods, had seen one of the two English- 
men, whom for distinction, I called the honest men, and he 
had made a sad complaint to the Spaniards of the barbarous 
usage they had met with from their three countrymen, and 
Low they had ruined their plantation, and destroyed theii 
com that they had labored so hard to bring forward, and 
killed the milch goat and their three kids, which was all they 
had provided for their sustenance ; and that if he and hip 
friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not assist them again, 
they should be starved. When the Spaniards came home 
at night, and they were all at supper, one of them took the 
freedom to reprove the three Englishmen, though in very 
gentle and mannerly terms, and asked them how they could 
be 80 cruel, they being harmless, inoffensive fellows ; that 
they were ^tting themselves in a way to subsist by their 
labor, and that it had cost them a great deal of pains to 
bring things to such perfection as they were then in. 

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, what had 
they to do there ? that they came on shore without leave ; 
and that they should not plant or build upon the island ; it 
was none of their ground. Why, says the Spaniard, very 
calmly, Senhor Inglese, they must not starve. The English- 
man replied, like a rough-hewn tarpauling, they might 
itarvo and be d— d ; they should not plant nor build in 
Uiat place. But what must they do then, senhor r said the 

Spaniard. . Another of the brutes returned. Do ? d ^o 

thom, they should be servants, and work for them. But 
how can you expect that of them ? says the Spaniard ; they 
»re nc»* bought with your money: you have no right t# 



$80 ADVENTURES Of 

make them servants. The Englishman answered, the iBlaiii 
was theirs ; the governor had given 't to them, and no man 
had anything to do there but themselves ; and with that 
swore by his Maker that they would go and >)um all theii 
new huts ; they should build none upon their land. Why, 
•enhor, says the Spaniard, by the same rule, we must be 
your servants too. — Ay, says the bold dog, and so you shall 
too, before we have done with you ; (mixing two or three 
G— d d — n me*s in the proper intervals of his speech.) 
The Spaniard only smiled at that, and made him no answer. 
However, this little discourse had heated them ; and, start- 
ing up one says to the other, I think it was he they called 
Will Atkins, Come, Jack, let's go, and have t'other brush 
with *em ; we'll demolish their castle, I'll warrant you ; 
they shall plant no colony in our dominions. 

Upon this they went all trooping away, with every man a 
gun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent 
things among themselves, of what they would do to the 
Spaniards too, when opportunity offered ; but the Spaniards, 
it seems, did not so perfectly understand them as to know 
jdl the particulars, only that, in general, they threatened 
them hard for taking the two Englishmen's part. 

Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time that 
evening, the Spaniards said they did not know; but it 
seems they wandered about the country part of the night, 
and then lying down in the place which I used to call mf 
bower, they were weary, an4 overslept themselves. The 
case was this ; they had resolved to stay till midnight, and 
so take the poor men when they were asleep, and, as they 
acknowledged afterwards, intended to set fire to their huts 
while they were in them, and either burn them there, o. 
murder them as they came* out ; as malice seldom sleepi 
very sound, it was very strange they should not have been 
f ep*. awake. 

However, as the two men had also a design upon then^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. S8l 

M I have said, though a much fairer one than that >f Lum 
ing and murdering, it happened, and very luckily for thesB 
all, that they were up and gone abroad, before the bli>ody- 
minded rogues came ti their huts. 

^^ hen they came there, and found the men gone, Atkins, 
▼ho, it seems, was the forwardest man, called out to bin 

lomrade. Ha, Jack, here's the nest, but, d n them, the 

jirds are flo\vn. They mused awhile, to think what should 
be the occasion of their being gone abroad so soon, and 
suggested presently that the Spaniards had given them 
notice :)f it ; and with that they shook hands, and swore tc 
one another that they would be revenged of the Spaniards. 
As soon as they had made this bloody bargain, they fell to 
work with the poor men's habitation : they did not set fire, 
indeed, to anything, but they pulled down both their houses, 
and pulled them so limb from limb, that they left not the 
least stick standing, or scarce any sign on the ground where 
they stood; they tore all their little collected household- 
stuff in pieces, and threw everything about in such a 
manner, that the poor men afterwards found some of theii 
things a mile off their habitation. When they had done 
this, they pulled up all the young trees which the poor men 
nad planted; pulled up an enclosure they had made to 
secure their cattle and their corn ^ and, in a word, sacked 
s.nd plundered everything as completely as a horde of 
faitars would have done. 

The two men were, at this juncture, gone to find them 
out, and had resolved to fight them wherever they had 
been, though they were but two to three ; so, that, had they 
met, there certainly would have Veen bloodshed among 
them ; for they were all very stout, resolute fellow^, to give 
them their due. 

But Providence took more care to keep them asundei 
flian they themselves could do to meet : for as if they had 
dogged c ne another, when the three were gone thither, tiu 



132 Ali VENTURES 01 

two were hejj; and afterwards, when the tnro went oaik t4 
^nd them, the three were come to the old hahitatioii again : 
we shall see their different conduct presently. When the 
*hree came back like furious creatures, flushed with the rage 
which the work they had been about had put them into, 
*hey came up to the Spaniards, and told them what they had 
lone, by way of scoff and bravado; and one of them, 
itepping up to one of the Spaniards, as if they had been a 
»uple of boys at play, takes hold of his hat as it was upon 
his head, and giving it a twirl about, fleering in his face, 
«ays to him, and you, Senhor Jack Spaniard, shall have 
the same sauce, if you do not mend your manners. The 
Spaniard, who, though a quiet civil man, was as brave a 
tian as could be, and withal a strong, well-made man, looked 
\i him for a good while, and then, having no weapon in his 
^and, stepped gravely up to him, and with one blow of his 
fist knocked him down, as an ox is felled with a pole-axe ; 
it which one of the rogues, as insolent as the first, fired his 
pistol at the Spaniard immediately ; he missed his body. 
Indeed, for the bullets went through his hair, but one o< 
them touched the tip of his car, and he bled pretty much 
The blood made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt than 
He really was, and that put him into some heat, for before 
he acted all in a perfeqt calm; but now resolving to go 
vhrough \vith his work, he stooped, and took the fellow's 
musket whom he had knocked down, and was just going to 
shoot the man who had fired at him, when the rest of the 
Spaniards, being in the cive, came out, and calling to him 
not to shoot, they stepped in, secured the other t^D, and 
took their arms from them. 

VVTien they were thus disarmed, and found they had made 
nil the Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own coun- 
crjmen, they began to cool, and, giving the Spaniards bettei 
•f ord^, would have their arms again ; but the Spani«'\rdF, 
rcrsidering the feud that was between them and the othe< 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. ^g^ 

fwo Englishneu, and that it would be the best method the^ 
eould take to keep them from killing one another, told them 
they would do them no harm, and if they would live peacea- 
bly, they would be very willing to assist and associate with 
them as they did before ; but that they could not think oi 
giving them their arms again, while they appeared so 
resolved to do mischief with them to their own countrymen, 
and had even threatened them all to make them their servants. 

The rogues were now no more capable to hear reason than 
to act with reason ; but being refused their arms, they went 
raving away, and raging like madmen, threatening what the) 
would do, though they had no fire-arms. But the Spaniards, 
despising their threatening, told them they should take care 
how they offered any injury to their plantation or cattle, for 
if they did, they would shoot them as they would ravenous 
beasts, wherever they found them ; and if they fell into 
their hands alive, they should certainly be hanged. How- 
ever, this was far from cooling them, but away they went, 
raging and swearing like furies of hell. As soon as they 
were gone, the two men came back, in passion and rage 
enough also, though of another kind; for having been at 
their plantation, and finding it all demolished and destroyed, 
as above, it will easily be supposed that they had provoca- 
tion enough. They could scarce have room to ttU thcii 
tale, the Spaniards were so eager to tell theirs ; an 1 it \% as 
strange enough to find that three men should thus bully 
nineteen, and receive no punishment at all. 

The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and especially, 
having thus disarmed them, made light of their threaten- 
ings ; but the two Englishmen resolved to have their 
remedy against them, what pains soever it cost to find then* 
out. But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told them, 
that as they had disarmed them, they could not consent that 
they (the two") should pursue them with fire-arms, and 
perhaps kil' them. But, said the grave Spanifird, who wj** 



iC4 ADVENTURES OF 

their governor, we will endeavor to make them do yo4 
justice, if you will leave it to us ; for there is no doubt but 
they will come to us again, when their passion is over, beii^j 
uot able to ^bsist without our assistance : we promise you 
to make no peace with them, without having a full satisfac- 
tion for vou ; and upon this condition we hope you will 
promise to use no violence with them, other than in youi 
own defence. The two Englishmen yielded to this very 
awkwardly, and with great reluctance ; but the Spaniard? 
protested that they did it only to keep them from blood- 
shed, and to make all easy at last. For, said they, we are 
not so many of us ; here is room enough for us all, and it is 
a great pity we should not be all good friends. At length 
they did consent, and waited for the issue of the thing, 
,?ving for some days with the Spaniards; for their own 
PHbitation was destroyed. 

In about five days' time the three vagrants, tired with 
wandering, and almost starved with hunger, having chiefly 
lived on turtles' eggs all that while, came back to the grove ; 
and finding my Spaniard, who, as I have said, was the 
governor, and two more with him walking by the side of the 
creek, they came up in a very submissive, humble manner, and 
begged to be received again into the family. The Spaniards 
used them civilly, but told them they had acted so un- 
naturally by their countrymen, and so very grossly by 
them (the Spaniards), that they could not come to any 
conclusion without consulting the two Englishmen and the 
rest; but, however, they would go to 6iem, and discourse 
ibout it, and they should know in half an hour. It may he 
guessed that they were very hard put to it : for, it seems, as 
^hey were to wait this half-hour for an answer, they begged 
*,hey would send them out some bread in the mean time, 
which they did ; sending, at the same time, a large piece ol 
goats's flesh, and a boiled parrot, which they ale very 
n^artily, for they were hungry enough. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 385 

After half an hour's consultation, they were called in, end 
* long debate ensued ; their two countrymen charging them 
with the niin of all their labor, and a design to murder 
them ; all which they owned before, and therefore could not 
deny now. Upon the whole, the Spaniards acted the 
moderator between them ; and as they had obliged the two 
Englishmen not to hurt the three while they were naked and 
unarmed, so they now obliged the three to go and rebuild 
their fellows' two huts, one to be of the same, and the other 
of larger dimensions, than they were before ; to fence their 
ground again where they had pulled up their fences, plant 
trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up the land again 
for planting com where they had spoiled it, and, in a word, 
to restore everything in the same state as they found it, as 
near as they could ; for entirely it could not be, the season 
for the corn, and the growth of the trees and hedges, noi 
being possible to be recovered. 

Well, they submitted to all this ; and as they had plenty 
of provisions given them all the while, they grew very order- 
ly, and the whole society began to live pleasantly and 
agreeably together again ; only, that these three fellows 
could never be persuaded to work, I mean for themselves, 
except now and then a little, just as they pleased : h >wever, 
the Spaniards told them plainly, that if they would but live 
sociably and friendly together, and study the good of the 
whole plantation, they would be content to work for them, 
and let them walk about and be as idle as they pleased : and 
thus having lived pretty well together for about a month or 
two, the Spaniards gave them arms again, and gave them 
Ub^rty to go abroad with them as before. 

It was not above a week after they had these arms, and 
went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures began to be as 
insolent and troublesome as before : but, however, an acci- 
dent happened presently upon this, which endangered the 
safety of them all ; and they were obliged to lay by aU

Sge ADVENT URB« OF 

private resentnento, and look to the preservation of iheii 
lives. 

It happened one night that the Spanish governor, as I call 
bitn, that is to say, the Spaniard whose life 1 had saved, 
who was now the captain, or leader, or governor of the rest, 
found himself very uneasy in the night, and could by no 
means get any sleep : he was perfectly well in body, as he 
told me the story, only found his thoughts tumultuous ; hiia 
mind ran upon men fighting and killing of one another, but 
he was broad awake, and could not by any means get any 
sleep : in short, he lay a great while ; but growing more 
and more uneasy, he resolved to rise. As they lay, being so 
many of them, upon goats' skins laid thick upon such couches 
and pads as they had made for themselves, and not in ham- 
mocks and ship beds, as I did, who was but one, so they had 
little to do, when they were willing to rise, but to get up 
upon their feet, and perhaps put on a coat, such as it was, 
and Iheir piunps, and they were ready for going any way 
that their thoughts guided them. Being thus got up, he 
looked out : but, being dark, he could see little or nothing , 
and besides, the trees which I had planted, as in my formei 
account is described, and which were now grown tall, inter- 
cepted his sight, so that he could only look up, and see that 
it was a clear starlight night, and hearing no noise, he re- 
turned and laid him down again : but it was all one ; he 
could not sleep, nor could he compose himself to anything 
like rest ; but his thoughts were to the last degree uneasy 
and he knew not for what. 

Having made some noise with rising and walking about, 
going out and coming in, another of them waked, and calling, 
asked who it was that was up. The governor told him hoi^ 
ft had been with mm. Say you so ? says the other Span* 
lard ; such things are not to be slighted, I assure you ; ther« 
in certainly 9 me mischief working near us ; and presently 
ae asked him. Where are the Englishmen ? — They are *iD 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 38, 

in theil l.uts, sa} 3 he, safe enough. It seems the Spaniardi 
had kept possession of the main apartment, and had made a 
place for the three Englishmen, who, since their last mutiny, 
were always quartered by themselves, and could not come at 
the rest. Well, says the Spaniard, there is something in it| 
I am persuaded, from my own experience. I am satisfied 
our spirits embodied have a converse with, and receive intel- 
ligem^e from, the spirits unembodied, and inhabiting the 
mvi»^ible world ; and this friendly notice is given for our 
idvantage, if we knew how to make use of it. Come, says 
be, let us go and look abroad ; and if we find nothing 
it all in it to justify the trouble, Til tell you a story to the 
purpose, that shall convince you of the justice of my pro- 
posing it. 

In a word, they went out, to go up to the top of the hill 
wLare I used to go ; but they being strong, and a good 
company, not alone, as I was» used none of my cautions, tc 
go up by the ladder, and pulling it up after them, to go up 
a second stage to the top, but were going round through the 
grove, unconcerned and unwary, when they were surprised 
with seeing a light as of fire, a very little way ofi* from them, 
and hearing the voices of men, not one or two, but of a great 
number. 

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages landing 
on the island, it was my constant care to prevent them making 
the least discovery of there being any inhabitant upon the 
place ; and when by any occasion they came to know it, 
thoy felt it so efiectually, that they that got away were scarce 
able to give any account of it ; for we disappeared as soon 
as possible ; nor did ever any that had seen me, escape 
t) tell any one else, except it was the three savages in 
)ur last encounter, who jumped into the boat ; of whom 
I mentioned, I was afraid they should go home and bring 
a»ore help. Whether it was the consequence of the escape

usual bloody errand, the Spaniards could not, it seems^ 
understand ; but whatever it was, it had been the'x businesi 
either to have concealed themselves, or not to have seen 
them at all, much less to have let the savages have seen that 
there were any inhabitants in the place ; or to have fallen 
upon them so effectually, as that not a man of them should 
have escaped, which could only have been by getting in 
between them and their boats ; but this presence of mind 
was wanting to them, which was the ruin of their tran- 
quility for a great while. 

We need not doubt but that the governor and the man 
with him, surprised with this sight, ran back immediately, 
and raised their fellows, giving them an account of the 
imminent danger, they were all in, and they again as readily 
took the alarm ; but it was impossible to persuade them 
to stay close within, where they were, but they must all 
run out to see how things stood. 

While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, and 
they had opportunity enough for some hours, to view them 
by the light of three fires they had mad#at a distance from 
one another; what they were doing they knew not, and 
what to do themselves they knew not. For, first, the 
enemy were too many; and, secondly, thc^ did not keep 
together, but were divided into several parties, and were on 
shore in several places. 

The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight ; 
and when they found that the -fellows ran straggling all over 
the shore, they made no doubt but, first or last, some ol 
them would chop in upon their habitation, or upon some 
other place where they would see the token of inhabitants ; 
and they were in great perplexity also for fear of their flocli 
of goats, which would have been little less than starving 
&em, if they should have been destroyed : so tl e first thing 
liiey resolved upon was to despatch three men away before 



ROBINSON CRUSOJffi. 38f 

it was light, two Spaniards and one Eaglishman to diive all 
Ihe goats away to the great valley where the cave was, and. 
If need were, to drive them into the very cave itself. Conld 
they have seen the savages all together in one body, and at 
a distance from their canoes, they resolved, if there had 
been a hundred of them, to have attacked them ; but that 
could not be ootained ; for they were some of them two 
miles off from the other ; and, as it appeared afterwards, 
were of two different nations. 

After having mused a great while on the course they 
should take, and beating their brains in considering their 
present circumstances, they resolved, at last, while it was 
still dark, to send the old savage, Friday's father, out as a 
spy, to learn, if possible, something concerning them; as 
what they came for, what they intended to do, and the like. 
The old man readily undertook it ; and stripping himself 
quite naked, as most of the savages were, away he went. 
After he had been gone an hour or two, he brings word that 
he had been among them undiscovered ; that he found they 
were two parties, and of two several nations, who had war 
with one another,t and had a great battle in their own 
country ; and that both sides having had several prisoners 
taken in the fight, they were, by mere chance, landed all on 
the same island, for the devouring their prisoners and 
making merry, but their coming so by chance to the same 
place had spoiled all their mirth ; that they were in a great 
rage at one another, and were so near, that he believed they 
would fight again as soon as daylight began to appear : but 
he did not perceive that they had any notion of any body 
being on the island but themselves. He had hardly made 
Ml end of telling his story, when they could perceive, by the 
unusual noise they made, that the two little armiea wert 
•engaged in a bloody fight. 

Friday's father used all the arguments ae could ta 
persuade our people to ie close, and not be seen : he told 
33*

cbem their safety consisted in it, and that they had nothing 
to do hut lie still, and the savages would kill one another to 
their hands, and then the rest would go away ; and it wai 
BO to a tittle. But it was impossible to prevail, especially 
upon the Englishmen ; their curiosity wai» so importunate 
upon their prudentials, that they must run out and see the 
battle ; however, they used some caution too, viz., they did 
not go openly, just by their own dwelling, but went farther 
into the woods, and placed themselves to advantage, where 
they might securely see them manage the fight, and, as they 
thought, not be seen by them ; but it seems the savages did 
fee them, as we shall find hereafter. 

The battle was very fierce ; and, if I might believe the 
Englishmen, one of them said he could perceive that some 
of them were men of great bravery, of invincible spirits, 
and of great policy in guiding the fight. The battle, they 
said, held two hours before they could guess which party 
would be beaten; but then, that party which was nearest 
our people's habitation began to appear weakest, and, after 
■ome time more, some of them began to fly ; and this put our 
men again into a great consternation, le^t any one of those 
that fled should run into the grove before their dwelling for 
Bnelter, and thereby involuntarily discover the place ; and 
that, by consequence, the pursuers would do the like in 
search of them. Upon this they resolved that the) would 
stand armed within the wall, and whoever came into the 
grove, they resolved to sally out over the wall and kill 
them : so that, if possible, not one should return to give an 
account of it, they ordered also that it should be done with 
their swords, or by knocking them down with the stocks ol 
their muskets, but not by shooting them, for fear of raising 
tn alarm by the noise. 

As they expected, it fell oi t : three of the routed army 
fled for life, and crossing the creek, ran direHly into the 
p ane, not in the least kno\nng whether they went, Im 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 991 

•anniLg as into a thick wood for shelter. The scoui they 
kept to look abroad gave notice of this within, with thii 
kddition, to our men's great satisfaction, viz., that the con 
querors had not pursued them, or seen which way they wero 
gone ; upon thi^, the Spaniard governor, a man of humanity, 
would not suffer them to kill the three fugitives, but sending 
three men out by the top of the hill, ordered them to gc 
round, come in behind them, and surprise and take there 
prisoners ; which was done. The re««idue of the conquered 
people fled to their canoes, and got off to sea ; the victorb 
retired, made no pursuit, or very little, but drawing them- 
■elves into a hody together, gave two screaming shouts, 
which they supposed was by way of triumph, and so the 
fight ended : and the same day, about three o'clock in the^ 
afternoon, they also marched to their canoes. And thus the 
Spaniards had their island again free to themselves, their 
fright was over, and they saw no savages in several years 
after. 

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of theii 
den, and viewing the field of battle, they found about two- 
and-thirty men dead on the spot : some were killed with 
great long arrows, some of which were found sticking in 
their bodies ; but most of them were killed with great 
wooden swords, sixteen or seventeen of which they found on 
the field of battle, and as many bows, with a great many 
arrows. These swords were strange, great, unwieldy things, 
and they must be very strong men that used them : most of 
those men that were killed with them had the:r heade 
mashed to pieces, as we may say, or, as we call it in Eng- 
lish, their brains knocked out, and several their arms and 
legs broken ; so that it is evident they fight with inex- 
pressible ragr, and fury. We found not one man that wai 
not stone dead, for either they stay^by their enemy till they 
have quite killed him, or they carry all the wounded mei 
hat are not quite dead away with them 



^^2 ADVENTURES Or 

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great while , 
the sight had filled them with horror, and the consequence! 
appeared terrible to the last degree, especially upon sup- 
posing that some time or other they should fall into th« 
^ands of those creatures, who would not only kill them as 
memies, but kill them for food, as we kill our cattle ; and 
hey professed to me, that the thoughts of being eaten up 
ike beef or mutton, though it was supposed it was not to 
oe till they were dead, had something in it so horrible, that 
.t nauseated their very stomachs, made them sick when the^i 
thought of it, and filled their minds with such unusual 
kcrror, they were not themselves for some weeks after. 
This, as I said, tamed even the three English brutes I have 
•oeen speaking of, and, for a great while after, they were 
xactable, and went about the common business of the whole 
jociety well enough ; planted, sowed, reaped, and began to 
De all naturalised to the country. But some time after this, 
they fell into such simple measures again, as brought them 
into a great deal of trouble. 

They had taken three prisoners, as 1 observed ; and these 
three being lusty, stout young fellows, they made them 
servants, and taught them to work for them ; and, as slaves, 
they did well enough ; but they did not take their measures 
with them as I did by my man Friday, viz., to begin 
with them upon the principle of having saved their lives, 
and then instruct them upon the rational principles of life ; 
much less of religion, civilizing, and reducing them by kind 
usage and affectionate arguings ; but as they gave them theif 
food every day, so they gave them their work too, and kept 
htem fully employed in drudgery enough ; but they failed «ii 
this by it, that they never had them to assist them, and 
fight for them, as I had my man Friday, who was as tnw 
to me as the very flesh upon my bones. 

But to come to the family part. Being all row good

recoo^iled them, •they began to consider their general ciicunf 
itances;- and the first thing that came under their coisidera^ 
tion, was, wLether, seeing the savages particularly haunted 
that side of the island, and that there were more remote and 
retired parts of it equally adapted to their way of living and 
manifestly to their advantage, they should not rather move 
their habitation, and plant in some more properplace for their 
•afety, and especially for the security of their cattle and com. 
Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that they 
would not remove their habitation ; because that, some time 
or other, they thought they might hear from their governor 
again, meaning me ; and if I should send any one to seek 
them, I should be sure to direct them to that side ; where, 
if they should find the place demolished, they would con- 
clude the savages had killed us all, and we were gone ; and 
BO our supply would go too. But as to their com and 
cattle, they agreed to remove them into the valley where my 
cave was, where the land was as proper for both, and where, 
indeed, there was land enough ; however, upon second 
thoughts, they altered one part of their resolution too, and 
resolved only to remove part of their cattle thither, and 
plant part of their com there ; and so if one pan waf 
destroyed, the other might be saved. And one part o* 
prudence they used, which it was very well they did, viz 
that they never trusted those three savages, which they ha"* 
prisoners, with knowing anything of the plantation they had 
made in that valley, or of any cattle they had there, much less 
of the cave there, which they kept, in case of necessity^ as a 
f afe retreat ; and thither they carried also the two barrels z)* 
powder which I had sent them at my coming away. But how- 
ever tney resolved not to change their habitation, yet they 
ftgreed, that as I had carefully covered it first with a wall oi 
fortification, and then with a grove of trees, so seeing theii 
•afety consisted entirely in their being concealed, of which 
ihey were now fully convinced, they set to work to cover and 



»94 ADVENTURES OP 

tonceal the place yet more effectually than .before. For thif 
purpose, as I planted trees, or rather thrust in stakes, which in 
time all grew up to be trees, for some good distance before 
the entrance into my apartments, they went on in the same 
manner, and filled up the rest of that whole space of 
ground, from the trees I had set, quite down to the side ol 
the creek, where, as I said, 1 landed my floats, and even 
into the very ooze where the tide flowed, not so much as 
leaving any place to land, or any sign that there had been 
any landing thereabout : these stakes also being of a wood 
very forward to grow, as I have noted formerly, they took 
care to have tnem generally much larger and taller than 
those which I had planted ; and as they grew apace, so they 
planted them so very thick and close together, that when 
they had been three or four years grown, there was no 
piercing with the eye any considerable way into the planta- 
tion : and, as for that part which I had planted, the trees 
were grown as thick as a man's thigh, and among them they 
placed so many other short ones, and so thick, that, in a 
word, it stood like a palisade a quarter of a mile thick, and 
it was next to impossible to penetrate it, but with a little 
army to cut it all down ; for a little dog could hardly get 
between the trees, they stood so close. 

But this was not all ; for they did the same by all the 
ground to the right hand and to the left, and round even to 
the top of the hill, leaving no way, not so much as for them- 
selves to come out, but by the ladder placed up to the side 
of the hill, and then lifted up, and placed again from the 
first stage up to the top, and when the ladder was taken 
down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to assist it 
could come at them. This was excellently well contrived ; 
nor was it less than what they afterwards found occasion for ; 
which served to convince me, that as human prudence has 
&e authority of Providence to justify it, so it has doubtless 
the direction of Providence to set it to work ; and if wii 



ROBINSON CRU80U. 59t 

iisteued carefully to the voice of it, I an. persiiaded wc 
might prevent many of the disasters which our lives are 
now, by our own negligence, subjected to : but this by the 
way. 

I return to the story. — They lived two years after this iv 
perfect retirement, and had no more visits from the savages 
Ihey had indeed an alarm given them one morning, which 
put them into a great consternation ; for some of the 
Spaniards being out early one morning on the west side, or 
rather end, of the island (which was that end where I never 
went, for fear of being di8covered),\they were surprised with 
seeing above twenty canoes of Indians just coming on 
shore. They made the best of their way home, in hurry 
enough ; and giving the alarm to their comrades, they kept 
close all that day and the next, going out only at night to 
make their observation : but they had the good luck to be 
mistaken ; for wherever the savages went, they did not land 
that time on the island, but pursued some other design. 

And now they had another broil with the three English- 
men, one of whom, a most turbulent fellow, being in a rage 
at one of the three slaves, which I mentioned they had 
taken, because the fellow had not done something which he 
bid him do, and seemed a little untractable in his showing 
him, drew a hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he wore it 
by his side, and fell upon the poor savage, not to correct 
him, but to kill him. One of the Spaniards, who was by, 
leeing him give the fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet, 
which he aimed at his head, but struck into his shoulders, so 
that he thought he iSkd cut the poor creature's arm off, 
ran to him, and entreating him not to murder the poor man, 
placed himself between him and the savage, to prevent the 
mischief. The fellow being enraged the more at this, struck 
at the Spaniard wi*,h his hatchet, and swore he would 8erv« 
him as he intended to serve the savage ; which the Spaniard 
perQeiving[, avoided the blow, and, with a shovel which ht 



596 ADVENTURES OK 

had in his hand) for they were all working in the field aboiS 
their corn-land) knocked the brute down. Another of thi 
Englishmen running at the same time to help his comrade, 
knocked the Spaniard down ; and then two Spaniards mori 
came in to help their man, and a third Englishman fell in 
upon them. They had none of them any fire-arms, or any 
other weapons but hatchets and other tools, except this third 
Englishmen ; he had one of my rusty cutlasses, with which 
tie made at the two last Spaniards, and wounded them joth. 
This fray set the whole family in an uproar, and more help 
coming in, they took the three Englishmen prisoners. The 
next question was, what should be done with them ? They 
had been so often mutinous, and were so very furious, so 
very desperate, and so idle withal, they knew not what 
course to take with them, for they were mischievous to the 
highest degree, and valued not what hurt they did to any 
man ; so that, in short, it was not safe to live with 
them. 

The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many 
words, that if they had been of his country, he would have 
hanged them ; for all laws and all governors were to pre- 
serve society, and those who were dangerous to the society 
ought to be expelled out of it ; but as they were English- 
men, and that it was to the generous kindness of an 
Englishman that they all owed their preservation and 
deliverance, he would use them with all possible lenity, and 
would leave them to the judgment of the other two English- 
men, who were their countrymen. 

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said 
they desired it might not be left to them; For, says he, 1 
am sure we ought to sentence them to the gallows: and 
with that he gives an account how Will Atkins, one of the 
three, had proposed to have all the five Englishmen join 
together, and murder all tae Spaniards whra they were ii 
thtir sleep. 



ttOBINSON CliUSOE. 397 

When the Spanish governor heard this, he call* o Wil! 
A.tkin8, How, Senhor Atkins, would you murder is all 
What have you to say to that ? The hardened villain wai 
BO far from denying it, that he said it was true ; and, G-^ 
d — n him, they would do it still, before they had done with 
them. Well, but Senhor Atkins, says the Spaniard, what 
have we done to you, that you will kill us ? And what 
would you get by killing us ? And wh t must we do to 
prevent your killing us ? Must we kill you, or you kill us ? 
Why will you put us to the necessity of this, Senhoi 
Atkins ? says the Spaniard very calmly and smiling. 
Senhor Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's making 
a jest of it, that, had he not been held by three men, and 
withal had no weapon near him, it was thought he would 
have attempted to have killed the Spaniard in the middle 
of all the company. This hairbrain carriage obliged them 
to consider seriously what was to be done : the two English- 
men, and the Spaniard who saved the poor savage, were 
of the opinion that they should hang one of the three, for 
an example to the rest ; and that particularly it should be 
he that had twice attempted to commit murder with his 
hatchet ; and, indeed, there was some reason to believe be 
had done it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable 
condition with the wound he had received, that it was 
thought he could not live. But the governor Spaniard still 
said no ; it was an Englishman that had saved all their lives, 
and he would never consent to put an Englishman to death, 
though he had murdered half of them ; nay, he said, if he 
had been killed himself by an Englishman, and had time 
left to speak, it should be that they should paiiou him. 

This uas so positively insisted on by the governor Span- 
laid, that there was no gainsaying it ; and as merciful coun- 
sels are most apt to prevail, where they are so earnestly 
pressed, so they all came into it : but then it was to be 
tonnidered what should be done to keep them from doing 
34 



^98 ADVENTURES OF 

the misc liuf they designed; for all agreed, governor and all 
that meuna were to be used for preserving the society from 
danger. After a long debate, it was agreed, first, that they 
should be disarmed, and not permitted to have either gun, 
pouder, shot, sword or any weapon ; and should be turned 
out of the society, and left to live where they would, and 
ho>7 they would, by themselves ; but that none of the rest, 
either Spaniards or English should converse with them 
speak with them, or have anything to do with them : thai 
they sliould be forbid to come within a certain distance of 
the place where the rest dwelt ; and if they offered to com- 
mit any disorder, so as to spoil, bum, kill, or destroy any 
of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belonging 
to the society, they should die without mercy, and they 
would shoot them wherever they could find them. 

The governor, a man of great humanity, musing upon the 
sentence, considered a little upon it ; and turning to the two 
honest Englishmen, said. Hold ; you must reflect that it will 
be long ere they can raise corn and cattle of their own, and 
thef must not starve ; we must therefore allow them pro- 
visions : so he caused to be added, that they should have a 
proportion of corn given them to last them eight months, 
and for seed to sow, by which they might be supposed to 
raise some of their own ; that they should have six milch- 
goats, four he-goats, and six kids given them, as well foi 
present subsistence as for a store ; and that they should 
have tools given them for their work in -the fields, such as 
six hatchets, an adze, a saw, and the like ; but they should 
have none of these tools oi provisions, unless they would 
swear solemnly that they would not hurt or injure any of 
the Spaniards with them, or of their fellow Englishmen. 

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them 
out to shift for themselves. They went away sullen and 
refractory, as neither content to go away nor to stay ; but 
ts thcrr was n< romc<lv, they went, pretending to go and 



UOBINSON CRUSOE $99 

choose a place where they would settle thenv aires , and 
some provisions wore given them, but no weapoL*. 

About four or five days after, they came agam for some 
Tictuals, and gave the governur an account where they had 
pitched their tents, and marked themselves out a habitatior 
and plantation ; and it was a very convenient place, indeed, 
on the remotest part of the island, N.E., much about the 
place where I providentially landed in my first voyage, 
when I was driven out to sea, the Lord alone knows whithei 
in my foolish attempt to sail round the island. 

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, iiud con- 
trived them in a manner like my first habitation, beiug closf 
under the side of a hill, having some trees growing already 
on three sides of it, so that by planting others, it would be 
very easily covered from the sight, unless narrowly .searched 
for. They desired some dried goat's-skins, for beds and 
covering, which were given them ; and upon giving their 
words that they would not disturb the rest, or injure any 
of their plantations, they gave them hatchets, and what 
rther tools they could spare; some peas, barle), and rice, 
for sowing ; and, in a word, anything they wanted, except 
arms and ammunition. 

They lived in this separate condition about six months, 
and had got in their first harvest, though the quantity was 
but small, the parcel of land they had planted being but 
little ; for, indeed, having all their plantation to form, they 
had a great deal of work upon their hands ; and when they 
came to make boards and pots, and such things, they were 
quite o«t of their element, and could make nothing of it • 
and when the rainy season came on, for want of a cave in 
the earth, they could not keep their grain dry, and it was in 
great danger of spoiling ; and this humbled them much ; so 
they came and begged the Spaniards to help them, which 
they very readily did ; and in four days worked a great hole 
In the side of the hill for them, big enough to secure thew

eom and Dthef things from the ram : hut it vas hu^ a pool 
place, at best, compared to mine, and especially as mine wai 
then, foi the Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and madt 
•everal new apartments in it. 

Ahout three-quarters of a year after this separation, a new 
frolic took these rogues, which, together with the fonnei 
villany they had committed, brought mischief enough upon 
them, and had very near been the ruin of the whole colony. 
The three new associates began, it seems, to be weary of the 
laborious life they led, and that without hope of bettering 
their circumstances : and a whim took them, that they would 
make a voyage to the continent, from whence the savages 
cune, and would try if they could seize upon some prisoners 
among the natives there, and bring them home, so to make 
them do the laborious part of their work for them. 

The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone nj 
farther ; but they did nothing, and proposed nothing, but 
had either mischief in the design, or mischief in the event ; 
and, if I may give my opinion, they seemed to be under a 
blast from Heaven ; for if we will not allow a visible curse 
to pursue visible crimes, how shall we reconcile the events 
of things with the divine justice ? It was certamly an 
apparent vengeance on their crime of mutiny and piracy that 
brought them to the state they were in ; and they showed 
not the least remorse for the crime, but added new villanies 
to it, such as the piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding a 
poor slave, because he did not, or perhaps could not, under* 
stand to do what he was directed, and to wound him m such 
a manner as made him a cripple all his life, and )9i a place 
wnere no surgeon or medicine could be had for his cure ; 
and what was still worse, the murderous intent, or, to do 
iustice to the crime, the intentional murder, for such to be 
•ure it was, as was afterwards the formed design they all 
laid, to murder the Spaniards in cold blood, and in fheii

But I leave observing, and return to the story. — The three 
fellows came down to the Spaniards one morning, and ir 
very humble terms desired to be admitted to speak with 
them ; the Spaniards very readily heard what they had to 
say, which was this : — That they were tired of living in 
the manner they did ; and that they were not handy enough 
to make the necessaries they wanted, and that having no 
help, they found they should be starved; but if the Span- 
iards would give them leave to take one of the canoes which 
they came over in, and give them arms and ammunition 
proportioned to their defence, they would go over to the 
main and seek their fortunes, and so deliver theip from the 
trouble of supplying them with any other provisions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but 
very honestly represented to them the certain destruction 
they were running into ; told them they had suffered such 
hardships upon that very spot, that they could, without any 
spirit of prophecy, tell them they would be starved, or mur- 
dered, and bade them consider of it. 

The men replied audaciously, they should be starved ii 
they stayed here, for they could not work, and would not 
work, and they could but be starved abroad ; and if they 
were murdered, there was an end of them ; they had no 
wives or children to cry after themr: and, in short, insisted 
mportunately upon their demand; declaring they would go, 
rhether they would give them any arms or no. 

The Spvniards told the -n, with great kindness, that if tiie) 
34* 



,402 ADVENTURKS OF 

Were resolved to go, tL y should not go like naked men, and 
be in no condition to ^defend themselves : and that thcug} 
they could ill spare their fire-arms, having not enough for 
themselves, yet they would let them have two muskets, h 
pistol and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet, which thej 
thought was sufficient for them. In a word, they accepted 
the ofier ; and having baked them bread enough to 8cr\e 
them a mf-nth, and given them as much goat's flesh as they 
could eat while it was sweet, and a great basket of dried 
grapes, and a pot of fresh water, and a young kid alive, they 
boldly set out in the canoe for a voyage over the sea, where 
it was at least forty miles broad. 

The boat, indeed, was a large one, and would very well 
have carried fifteen or twenty men, and therefore was rather 
too big for them to manage ; but as they had a fair breeze, 
and flood tide with them, they did well enough. They had 
made a mast of a long pole, and a Siul of four large goats*- 
skins dried, which they had sewed or laced together ; and 
away they went merrily enough ; the Spaniards called after 
them, Buen xnage ; and no man ever thought of seeing then 
any more. 

The Spaniards were often saying to one another, and to 
the two honest Englishmen who remained behind, hc»w 
quietly and comfortably they had lived, now these three 
turbulent fellows were gone : as for their coming again, 
that was the remotest thing from their thoughts that could 
be imagined ; when, behold, after two-and-twenty days* 
absence, one of the Englishmen, being abroad upon hi«k 
planting work, sees three strange men coming towards Lira 
at a distance, with guns upon their shoulders. 

Away runs the Englishman, as if he was bewitched, comes 
frightened and amazed to the governor Spaniard, and tells 
him they were all undone, for there were strangers landed 
opon the island, but could not tell who. The Spaniard, 
piusing a while, Fays to him, How do you mean, you cannol 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 40;. 

lell vvlio : Tiicy are the savages, to be sure. — No, no, sayi 
the Englishmen ; they are men in clothes, with arms. — • 
Nay, then, says the Spaniard, why are you concerned ? II 
they are not savages, they must be friends ; for there is no 
Christian nation upon earth but will do us good rather than 
barm. 

While they were debating thus, came the three Englisn- 
men, and standing without the wood, which was new planted, 
ball Joed to them : they presently knew their voices, and so 
all the wonder of that kind ceased. But now the admiration 
was turned upon another question, viz.. What could be th^ 
matter, and what made them come back again ? 

It was not long before they brought the men in, and 
inquiring where they had been, and what they had been 
doing, they gave them a full account of their voyage in a 
few words, viz.. That they reached the land in two days, or 
something less ; but finding the people alarmed at their 
coming, and preparing with bows and arrows to fight them, 
they durst not go on shore, but sailed on to the northward 
six or seven hours, till they came to a great opening, by 
which they perceived that the land they saw from our island 
was not the main, but an island ; upon entering that opening 
of the sea, they saw another island on the right hand, north, 
and several more west; and being resolved to land some- 
where, they put over to one of the islands which lay west, 
and went boldly on shore : that they found the peoplo very 
courteous and friendly to them ; and that they gave there 
several roots ard some dried fish, and appeared very 
■ociable ; and tue women as well as the men were very 
forward to supply them with anything they could get foi 
ihem to eat, and brought it to them a great way upon theii 
heads. 

They continued here four days ; and inquired, as well as 
they could of them, by signs, what nations were this way, 
tnd th« t V ay ; and were toJd o^ several fierce ^nd tertiWt 



404 ADVENTURES OF 

people that lived almost every way, who, as they madf 
known by signs to them, used to eat men ; but as for them* 
■elves, they said they never ate men or women, except onlj 
such as they took in the wars ; and then, they owned, they 
made a great feast, and ate their prisoners. 

The Englishmen inquired when they had had a feast of that 
kind ; and they told them about two moons ago, pointing to 
the moon, and to two fingers ; and that their great king had 
two hundred prisoners now, which he had taken in his war, 
and they were feeding them to make them fat for the next 
feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty desirous of seeing 
those prisoners ; but the others mistaking them, thought they 
were desirous to have some of them to carry away for theii 
own eating : so they beckoned to them, pointing to the set- 
ting of the sun, and then to the rising ; which was to 
signify that the next morning at sun-rising they would 
bring some for them ; and, accordingly, the next morning, 
they brought down five women, and eleven men, and gave 
them to the Englishmen, to carry with them on their voyage, 
just as we would bring so many cows and oxen down to a 
seaport town to victual a ship. 

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at homoi 
their stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know 
what to do. To refuse the prisoners would have been the 
highest affront to the savage gentry that could be offered 
them, and what to do with them they knew not. However, 
after some debate, they resolved to accept of them ; and, in 
return, they gave the savages that brought them one of their 
hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of theif 
bullets ; which, though they did not understand their use, 
they seemed particularly TDleased with ; and then tying the 
Door creatures* hands behind them, they dragged the pris- 
oners into the boat for our men. 

The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon af 
toey bad them, or else they that gave them thi^ noble present 



ROBINSON CRUSOB 4OC 

i^ould certainly have expected that they should have gon« 
to work with them, have killed two or three of them th» 
next morning, and perhaps have invited the donors to di»»- 
aer. But having taken their leave, with all the respect and 
thanks that could well pass between people, where, on eithei 
•ide, they understood not one word they could say, they put 
off with their boat, and came back towards the first island ; 
where, when they arrived, they set eight of their pris- 
oners at liberty, there being too many of them for theii 
occasion. 

In their voyage, they endeavored to h ive some communi- 
cation with their prisoners; but it was impossible to make 
them understand anything ; nothing they could say to thenu 
Qr give them, or do for them, but was looked upon as going 
to murder them. They first of all unbound them ; but the 
poor creatures screamed at that, especially the women, as b 
they had just felt the knife at their throats ; for they imme- 
diately concluded they were unbound on purpose to be 
killed. If they gave them anythinj^ to eat, it was the same 
thing ; they then concluded it was for fear they should sink 
in flesh, and so not be fat enough to kill. If they looked 
at one of them more particularly, the party presently con- 
cluded it was to see whether he or she was fattest, and 
fittest to kill first ; nay, after they had brought them quite 
over, and begun to use them kindly, and treat them well, 
still they expected every day to make a dinner or supper for 
their new masters. 

Wlien the three wanderers had given this unaccountable 
history or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard asked them 
where their new family was ; and being told that they hac 
brought them on shore, and put them into one of ^heir huts, 
and were come up to beg some victuals for them, they (thf 
Spaniards) and the other two Englishmen, *hat is to say, 
the whole colony, resolved to go all down to the place aird 
■ee them ; and did so, and Friday's Neither wit^ them 



lOe ADVENTURES Of 

When they came into the hut, there they ss ill bound 
for when they had brought them on shore, they bound theii 
hands ^hat they might not take the boat and make theil 
escape , there, I say, they sat, all of them stark naked. 
First, there were three men, lusty, comely fellows, well- 
shaped, straight and fair limbs, about thirty to thirty-£ve 
years of age ; and five women, whereof two might be from 
thirty to forty ; two more not above four or five-and-twenty ; 
and the fifth, a tall comely maiden, about sixteen or seven- 
teen. The women were well-favored, agreeable persons, 
both in shape and features, only tawny ; and two of them, 
had they been perfect white, would have passed for very 
handsome women, even in London itself, having pleasant 
agreeable countenances, and of a very modest behavior: 
especially when they came afterwards to be clothed and 
dressed, as they called it, though that dress was very indif- 
ferent, it must be confessed ; of which hereafter. 

The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to 
our Spaniards, who were, to give them a j ust character, men 
of the best behavior, of the most calm, sedate tempers, and 
perfect good humor, that ever I met with ; and, in particular, 
of the most modest, as will presently appear : I say, the 
sight was very uncouth, to see three naked men and five 
naked women, all together bound, and in the most miserable 
circumstances that human nature could be supposed to be, 
viz., to be expecting every moment to be dragged out, and 
have their brains knocked out, and then to be eaten up like 
a calf that is killed for a dainty. 

The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, 
Friday's father, to go in, and see, first, if he knew any ol 
them, and then if he understood my of their speech. As 
soon as the old man came in, he looked seriously at them, 
but knew none of them, neither could any of them under* 
itand a word he said, or a sign he could make, except one 
of the women. However, this was enough to answer thr 



ilOlilNSON CRUSOE. 40, 

end, which w%s to satisfy them that the n en into whos€ 
aands they were fallen were Christians ; that they al : orred 
eating men or women ; and that that they might be sure 
they woul A not be killed. As soon as they were assured ol ' 
this, thsy discovered such a joy, and by such awkward ges- 
tures, several ways, as is hard to describe ; for, it seemi, 
they were of several nations. 

The woman who was their interpreter was bid, in the 
next place, to ask them if they were willing to be servants, 
and to work for the men who had brought them away, to 
save their lives ; at which they all fell a dancing ; and pres- 
sently one fell to taking up this, and another that, anything 
that lay next, to carry on their shoulders, to intimate that 
they were willing to work. 

The governor, who found that the having women among 
them would presently be attended with some inconvenience 
and might occasion some strife, and perhaps blood, asked 
the three men what they intended to do with these women, 
and how they intended to use them, whether as servants or 
as women ? One of the Englishmen answered very bold) 
and readily, that they would use them as both ; to which 
the governor said, I am not going to restrain you from it ; 
you are your own masters as to that ; but this I think is but 
just, for avoiding disorders and quarrels among you, and I 
desire it of you for that reason only, viz., that you will all 
engage, that if any of you take any of these women, as a 
woman or wife, that he shall take but one : and that having 
taken one, none else shall touch her ; for though we cannot 
marry any one of you, yet it is but reasonable that while 
you stay here, the woman any of you takes should be main* 
tained by the man that takes her, and should be his wife ; I 
mean, says he, while he continues here, and that none else 
shall have anything to do with her. All this appeared sf 
»ust, that every one agreed to it \vithout any difficulty. 

Then the Englbhmen asked the Spaniards if they ie» 



^08 ADVENTURES OF 

aigned to take any of them ? But every one of them an 
iwered no : some of them said they had wives in Spain, and 
the others did not like women that were not Christiana : 
•and all together declared that they would not touch one ol 
them : which was an instance of such virtue as I have no* 
met with in all my travels. On the other hand, to be short, 
the five Englishmen took them every one a wife, that is to 
lay, a temporary wife ; and so they set up a new form of 
living ; for the Spaniards and Friday's father lived in my 
old habitation, which they had enlarged exceedingly within. 
The three servants which were taken in the late battle of 
the savages lived with them ; and these carried on the main 
part of the colony, supplied all the rest with food, and 
assisted them in anything as they could, or as they found 
necessity required. 

But the wonder of the story was, how five such refractory, 
ill-matched fellows should agree about these women, and 
that two of them should not pitch upon the same woman, 
especially seeing two or three of them were, without com- 
parison, more agreeable than the others : but they took a 
good way enough to prevent quarrelling among themselves : 
for they set the ^ve women by themselves in one of their 
huts, and they went all into the other hut, and drew lot« 
fcmong them who should choose first. 

He that drew to choose first went away by himself to the 
hut where the poor naked creatures were, and fetched out 
her he chose, and it was worth observing, that he that 
chose first took her that was reckoned the homeliest and ' 
widest of the five, which made mirth enough among the 
I est; and even the Spaniards laughed at it: but the fellow 
considered better than any of them, that it was application 
and business they were to expect assistance in, as much a« 
in anything else ; and she proved the best wife of all the 
uarcei. 

^Vhen the poor women saw themselves set in a row ihw^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 409 

And fttched « *.. one by one, the terrors of their toudition 
returned upon them again, and they firmly believed they 
were now going to be devoured. Accordingly^ when the 
English sailor came in and fetched out one of them, the rest 
«et up a most lamentable cry, and hung about her, and took 
their leave of her with such agonies and affection, as would 
have grieved the hardest heart in the world; nor was it 
possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them that they were 
not to be immediately murdered, till they fetched the old 
man, Friday's father, who immediately let them know that 
the five men, who had fetched them out one by one, had 
chosen them for their wives. 

When they had done, and the fright the women were in 
was a little over, the men went to work, and the Spaniards 
eame and helped them ; and in a few hours they had built 
them every one a new hut or tent for their lodging apart ; 
for those they had already were crowded with their toobi, 
household stuff, and provisions. The three wicked ones 
had pitched farthest off, and the two honest ones nearer, 
but both on the north shore of the island, so that they 
continued separated as before; and thus my island was 
peopled in three places ; and, as I might say, three towns 
were begun to be built. 

And here it is very well worth observing, that, as it often 
happens in the world (what the wise ends of God's provi- 
dence are, in such a disposition of things, I cannot say), the 
two honest fellows had the two worst wives ; and the three 
reprobates, that were scarce worth hanging, that were fit for 
nothing, and neither seemed bom to do themselves good, 
nor any one else, had three clever, diligent, careful, and 
ingenious wives : not that the first two were bad wives, as 
to their temper and humor, for all the five were most willing, 
quiet, passive, and subjected creatures, rather like slavei 
than wives ; but my meaning is, they were not alike, capa* 
ble, ingenious, or industrious, or alike cleanly and neat .

410 ADVENTUKES OF 

Aiiotaer observation I must make, to he honor of a UIH* 
gent application, on one hand, and to the disgrace of a sloth« 
fill, negligent, idle temper, on the other, that when I came 
to the place, and viewed the several improvements, plants 
ings, and management of the several little colonies, the two 
men hac so far outgone the three, that there was no com- 
parison. They had, indeed, both of them as much ground 
laid out for corn as they wanted, and the reason was, be- 
f ause, according to my rule, nature dictated that it was to no 
purpose to sow more corn than they wanted ; but the differ- 
ence of the cultivation, of the planting, of the fences, and,' 
indeed, of everything else, was easy to be seen at first 
riew. 

The two men had innumerable young trees planted about 
♦heir huts, so that when you came to the place, nothing was 
to be seen but wood : and though they had twice had their 
plantation demolished, once by their own countrymen, and 
once by the enemy, as shall be shown in its place, yet they 
had restored all agam, and everything was thriving and 
flourishing about them : they had grapes planted in order, 
and managed like a vineyard, though they had themselves 
never seen anything of that kind ; and by their good order- 
ing their vines, their grapes were as good again as any ol 
the others. They had also found themselves out a retreat 
in the thickest part of the woods ; where, though there was 
not a natxiral cave, as I had found, yet they made one with 
incessant labor of their hands, and where, when the mischiel 
which followed happened, they secured their wives and 
children, so as they could never be found ; they having, by 
{ticking innumerable stakes and poles of the wood which, at 
I said, grew so readily, made the grove unpassable, except in 
Bome places where ^hey climbed up to get over the outsidf 
part, and then went on by ways of their own leaving. 

As to the three eprobates, as I justly call them, though 
Ihey were much ci' tlized by their settlement, compared ti 



ROblNSON CRUSOE. 41 

irhat ihty were I i>fore, and were not so quarrelsome. Laving 
not the same opportunity ; yet one of the certain com- 
panions of a profligate mind never left them, and that waj 
their idleness. It is true, they planted com, and madd 
fences; but Solomon's words were never better verified 
than in them, ** I went by the vineyard of the slothful, and 
it was all overgrown with thorns ;" for when the Spaniards 
came to view their crop, they could not see it in some 
placf^s for weeds, the hedge had several gaps in it, where the 
wild goats had got in and eaten up the corn ; perhaps here 
and there a dead bush, was crammed in, to stop them out 
for the present, but it was only shutting the stable-door 
after the steed was stolen : whereas, when they looked on 
me colony of the other two, there was the very face of in- 
dustry and success upon all they did : there was not a weed 
to be seen in all their corn, or a gap in any of their hedges ; 
and they, on the other hand, verified Solomen's words in 
another place, " that the diligent hand maketh rich ;" for 
everything grew and thrived, and they had plenty within 
and without ; they had more tame cattle than the others, 
more utensils and necessaries within doors, and yet more 
pleasure and diversion too. 

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and 
cleanly within doors, and having learned the English ways 
of dressing and cooking from one of the other Englishmen 
who, as I said, was a cook*s mate on board the ship, they 
Jressed their husbands' victuals very nicely and well; 
whereas the others could not be brought to understand it: 
tut then the husband, who, as I say, had been cook's mate 
did it himself. But as for the husbands of the three wives 
they loitered about, fetched turtles' eggs, and caught figl 
and birds ; in a word, anything but labor, and they fared 
accordingly. The diligen; lived well and comfoitably; and 
the slothful lived hard and beggarly ; and so, 1 belief q 
generally speaking it is all over the world. 



114 AD\^NTUHKS OF 

^nt they cair ed tlien first to the bower, where was the chiel 
of their country work, such as the keeping the goats, the 
planting the com, 6lc, ; and afterwards they carried them tc 
Uie habitation of the two Englishmen. 

Here they were set to work, though it was not much they 
had for them to do ; and whether it was by negligence in 
guarding them, or that they thought the fellows could not 
mend themselves, I know not, but one of them run away^ 
and taking to the woods, they could never hear of him any 
more. 

They had good reason to believe he got home again soon 
atter, in some other boats or canoes of savages who came on 
shore three or four weeks afterwards ; and who, carrying on 
their revels as usual, went off in two days time. This 
thought terrified them exceedingly ; for they concluded, and 
that not without good cause indeed, that if this fellow came 
home safe among his comrades, he would certainly give 
them an account that there were people in the island, and 
also how few and weak they were : for this savage, as I 
observed before, had never been told, and it was very happy 
he had not, how many there were, or where they lived ; nor 
had he ever seen or heard the fire of any of their guns, 
much less^had they shown him any of their other retired 
places ; such as the cave in the valley, or the new retreat 
which the two Englishmen had made, and the like. 

The first testimony they had that this »fellow had giv»n 
intelligence of them was, that, about two months after this, 
six canoes of savages, with about seven, eight, or ten men 
In a canoe, came rowing along the north side of the island, 
where they ne^r used to come before, and landed, about an 
Lour after sunrise, at a convenient place, about a mile front 
the habitation of the two Englishmen, where this escaped 
man had been kept. As the Spaniard governor said, had 
•hej- been all there, the damage would not have been st 
iivch. for not a man of then- would have escaped : but th« 



ROBINSON CRUbOE. 41^ 

bMe differed now very much, for two men to fifty was too 
liuch odds. The two men had the happiness to discovei 
them about a leag\:e off', so that it was above an hour before 
they landed ; and as they landed a mile from their huts, it 
was some time before they could come at them. Now, 
having great reason to believe that they were betrayed, the 
first thing they did was to bind the two slaves which were 
lefl, and caused two of the three men whom they brou^bl 
with the women (who, it seems, proved very faithful to 
them) to lead them, with their two wives, and whatever 
they could carry away with them, to their retired places in 
the woods, which I have spoken of above, and there to bind 
the two fellows hand and foot, till they heard further. 

In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on 
shore, and that they had bent their course directly that way, 
they opened the fences where the milch goats were kept, 
and drove them all out ; leaving their goats to straggle in 
the woods, whither they pleased, that the savages might 
think they were all bred wild ; but the rogue who came 
with them was too cunning for that, and gave them an 
account of it all, for they went directly to the place. 

When the two poor frightened men had secured their 
wives and goods, .they sent the other slave they had of the 
three who came with the women, and who was at their place 
by accident, away to the Spaniards with all speed, to give 
them the alarm, and desire speedy help ; and, in the mean 
time, they took their arms and what ammunition they had, 
and retreated towards the place in the wood where ^heii 
wives were sent ; keeping at a distance, yet so that they 
might see, if possible, which way the savages took. 

They had not gone far, but that from a rising ground they 
could see the little army of their enemies come on directly 
wO their habitation, and, in a moment more, could see all 
Aeir huts and household stuff flaming up together, to theii 
l^reat gTVt£ and mortification ; for they h^d a very great lost 



^16 AD\ENTUKES OK 

to them irretrievable, at least for some time. They kepT 
their station for a while, till they found the savages, like 
wild beasts, spread themselves all over the place, rummaging 
every way and every place they could think of, in search 
of prey; and in particular for the people, of whom, now, U 
plainly appeared they had intelligence. 

The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves nut 
secure where they stood, because it was likely some of the 
wild people might come thaf way, and they might come loo 
many together, thought it proper to make another retreat 
about half a mile farther ; lieiieving, as it afterwards hap- 
pened, that the farther they strolled the fewer would ba 
together.

Theib next halt was at the entrance into a very thick-grown 
part of the woods, and where an old trunk of a tree stood, 
which was hollow and vastly large ; and in this tree they 
both took their standing, resolving to see there what might 
offer. They had not stood there long, before two of the 
savages appeared running directly that way, as if they 
already had notice where they stood, and were coming up to 
attack them ; and a little way farther they espied three more 
coming after them, and fiv3 more beyond them, all coming 
the same way ; besides which, they saw seven or eight more 
%t a distance, running another way ; for, in a word, they raq 
tvery way, like sportsmen beating for their game. 
The poor men were now in great perplexity whether the^

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 41/ 

f •: ould Btand and keep their posture, or fly ; but, aftei . 1 
»ery short debate "with themselves, they considered, that i\ 
the savages ranged the country thus before help came, they 
might perhaps find out their retreat in the woods, and then 
all would be lost : so they resolved to stand them there ; 
and if they were too many to deal with, then they wouli 
get up to the top of the tree, from whence they doubted net 
tc defend themselves, fire excepted, as long as their ammu- 
nition lasted, though all the savages that were landed, which 
was near fifty, were to attack them. 

Having resolved upon this, they next considered whetlfer 
they should fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and 
BO take the middle party, by which the two and the five that 
followed would be separated : at length they resolved to let 
the first two pass by, unless ihey should spy them in the 
tree, and come to attack them. The first two savages con- 
firmed them also in this resolution, by turning a little from 
them towards another part of the wood ; but the three, and 
the five after them, came forward directly to the tree, as if 
they had known the Englishmen were there. Seeing them 
come so straight toward them, they resolved to take them in 
a line as they came : and as they resolved to fire but one at 
a time, perhaps the first shot might hit them all three ; for 
which purpose, the man who was to fire put three or four 
small bullets into his piece ; and having a fair loophole, ab 
it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim, 
without being seen, waiting till they were within aboul 
thirty yards of the tree, so that he could not miss. 

While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on^ 
they plainly saw that one of the three was the runaway 
lavage that had escaped from them ; and they both knew 
him distinctly, and resolved that, if possible, he should not 
Mcape, though tliey should both fire ; so the other stood 
«eady ^jjith his piece, that if he did not drop at the first shot 
/ ie should be I'lre *o have a second. But the firet was to$ 



418 ADVENTURER Of 

good i marksman to miss his aim ; for as the savages ke]i^ 
near one another, a little behind, in a line, he fired, an i hi 
two of them directly : the foremost was killed outright 
being shot in the head ; the second, which was the runawaj 
Indian, was shot through the body, and fell, but was not 
quite dead ; and the third had a little scratch in the shoulder, 
perhaps by the same ball that went through the body of the 
second ; and being dreadfully frightened, though not so 
much hurt, sat down upon the ground, screaming and yelling 
in a hideous manner. 

The five that were behind, more frightened with the noise 
than sensible of the danger, stood still at first ; for the 
woods made the sound a thousand times bigger than it 
really was, the echoes rattling from one side to another, and 
the fowls rising frum all parts, screaming, and every sort 
making a different noise, according to their kind ; just as it 
was when I fired the first gun that perhaps was ever shot ofl 
in the ibland. 

However, all being silent again, and they not knowing 
what the matter was, came on unconcerned, till they came 
to the place where their companions lay, in a conditior 
miserable enough ; and here the poor ignorant creatures 
not sensible that they were within reach of the same mis- 
chief, stood all of a huddle over the wounded man, talking, 
and, as may be supposed, inquiring of him how he came tc 
be hurt ; and who, it is very rational to believe, told them, 
that a flash of fire first, and immediately after that thundei 
from their gods, had killed those two and wounded him ; 
this, I say, is rational ; for nothing is more certain than that, 
as they saw no man near them, so they had never heard a 
gun in all their lives, nor so much as heard of a gun ; 
Aeither knew they anything of killing and wounding at t 
distance with fire and bullets : if they had^ one migb^ 
'easonably believe they would not have stood so^ nncon

earced in viemng the fate of their fellows, without boom 
apprehensions of their own. 

Our two m 3n, though, as they confessed to me, it grieved 
them to be obliged to kill so many poor creatures, who, at 
the same time, had no notion of their danger ; yet, having 
them all thus in their power, and the first having loaded hit 
V>iec3 again, resolved to let fly both together among them ; 
and singling out, by agreement, which to aim at, they sliot 
together, and killed, or very much wounded, four of them ; 
the fifth, frightened even to death, though not hurt, fell with 
the rest ; so that our men, seeing them all fall together, thought 
they had killed them all. 

The belief that the savages were all killed, made our two 
men come boldly out from the tree before they had charged 
their guns, which was a wrong step ; and they were under some 
surprise when they came to the place, and found no less than 
four of them alive, and of them two very little hurt, and one 
not at all : this obliged them to fall upon them with the stocks 
of their muskets : and first they made sure of the runaway 
lavage, that had been the cause of all the mischief, and ol 
another that was hurt in the knee, and put them out of their 
pain : then the man that was hurt not at all came and kneeled 
down to them, with his two hands held up, and made piteous 
moans to them, by gestures and signs for his life, but could 
not say one word to them that they could understand. How- 
ever, they made signs to him to ait down ut the foot of a tree 
hard by ; and one of the Englishmen, with a piece of rope 
twined, which he had by great chance in his pocket, tied his 
two hands behind him, and there they left him : and with ^-^ 
what speed they could made after the other two, which were 
gone before, fearing they, or any more of them, should find 
the way to their covered place in the woods, where thci/ 
wiv 58, and the few goods they had left, lay. They came once 
b light of the two men, but it was at a g^at ^istarce ; how* 



/ 



430 ADVENTURES OF 

ever, they had the satisfaction to see them cross over a yaUe; 
towards the sea, quite the contrary way from that which led 
to their retreat, which they were afraid of; and being satis- 
fied of that, they went back to the tree where they left theii 
prisoner, who. is they supposed, was delivered by his com- 
rades, for he was gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn, with 
which they had bound him, lay just at the foot of the tree. 

They were now in as great concern as before, not knowing 
what course to take, or how near the enemy might be, or in 
what numbers : so they resolved to go away to the place 
where their wives were, to see if all was well there, and to 
make them easy, who were in fright enough, to be sure ; for 
though the savages were their own countryfolk, yet they were 
most terribly afraid of them, and perhaps the more for the 
knowledge they had of them. 

When they came there, they found the savages had been in 
the wood, and very near that place, but had not found it : for 
it was indeed inaccessible, by the trees standing so thick, as 
before, unless the persons seeking it had been directed by 
those that knew it, which these did not : they found, there- 
fore, everything very safe, only the women in a terrible fright. 
While they were here, they had the comfort to have seven oi 
the Spaniards come to their assistance : the other ten, witi* 
their servants, and old Friday, I mean Friday's father, wcit 
gone in a body to defend their bower, and the corn and cat- 
tle that was kept there, in case the savages should have roved 
over to that side of the country ; but they did not spread so 
far. With the seven Spaniards came one of the three savages 
who, as I said, were their prisoners formerly ; and with them 
also came the savage whom the Englishmen had left bound 
nand and foot at the tree : for it seems, they came that way, 
saw the slaughter of the seven men, and unbound the eighth, 
and brought hira along with them ; where, however, they 
were obliged to bind him again, as they had the two othen 
irW were ef*. when the third ran awav. 



ROBINSON CllUSOE. 42 , 

The prisoners now began U be a burthen to them ; and 
they were so afraid of their escaping, that they were once 
resolving to kill them ail, believing they were under an abso- 
lute necessity to do so for their own preservation. However, 
the Spaniard governor would not consent to it ; but ordered, 
for the present, that they should be sent out of the way, to 
my old cave in the valley, and be kept there, with two Span- 
iards to guard them, and give them food for their subsistence, 
which was done ; and they were bound there hand and foot 
for that night. 

When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so 
encouraged, that they could not satisfy themselves to stay any 
longer there ; but taking five of the Spaniards and them- 
selves, with four muskets and a pistol among them, and two 
stout quarter-staves, away they went in quest of the savages. 
And first they came to the tree where the men lay that had 
been killed ; but it was easy to see that some more of the 
savages had been there, for they had attempted to carry their 
dead men away, and had dragged two of them a good way, 
but had given it over. From thence they advanced to the 
first rising ground, where they had stood and seen their camp 
destroyed, and where they had the mortification still to see 
some of the smoke : but neither could they here see any ol 
the savages. They then resolved, though with all possible 
caution, to go forward, towards their ruined plantation ; but 
a little before they came thither, coming in sight of the sea- 
shore, they saw plainly the savages all embarked again in 
their canoes, in order to be gone. They seemed sorry, at 
first, that there was no way to come at them, to give them a 
parting blow ; but, upon the whole, they were very well 
satisfied to be rid of them. 

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all 
their improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and 
help them to rebuild, and to assist them with needful sup- 
plies. Theii three countrymen, who were not yet noted foi 
36 



422 ADVENTURES OF 

Having the least inclination to do any good, yet aA ftoos 
as they henrd of it (for they living remote eaAtward, 
knew nothing of the matter till all was over), came and 
offered their help and assistance, and did, very friendly, work 
for several days, to restore their habitation, and make neccs* 
•aries for them. And thus, in a little time, they were nei 
upon their legs again. 

About two days after this, they had the further satisfaction 
of seeing three of the savages* canoes come driving on shore, 
and, at some distance from them, two drowned men ; by • 
which they had reason to believe that they had met with a 
storm at sea, which had overset some of them ; for it had 
blown very hard the night after they went off. 

However, as some might miscarry, so, on the other hand, 
enough of them escaped to inform the rest, as well of what 
they had done as of what had happened to them, and to 
whet them on to another enterprise of the same nature ; 
which they, it seems, resolved to attempt, with sufficient 
force to carry all before them ; for except what the first man 
had told them of inhabitants, they could say little of it ol 
their own knowledge, for they never saw one man ; and the 
fellow being killed that had affirmed it, they had no other 
witness to confirm it to them. 

It was five or six months after this, before they heard any 
more of the savages, in which time our men were in hopes 
they had either forgot their former bad luck, or given over 
hopes of better; when, on a sudden, they were invaded 
with a most formidable fleet of no less than eight-and-twenty 
canoes, ftill of savages, armed with bows and arrows, great 
elubs, wooden swords, and such-like engines of war ; anu 
they brought such numbers with them, thj^t, in short, it put 
all our people into the utmost consternation. 

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the eae tern- 
most side of the island, our men had that night tc* consult 
«nd consider wb it t ) do ; and, in the first place, knowiPji 



ROBINSON CRUSOK. 42% 

ibat their being entirely concealed wa» theii only safety 
6efoie, and would be nwch more so now, while the numbei 
of their enemies was so great, they therefore resolved, first 
of all, to take down the huts which were built for the twc 
finglishmen, and drive away their goats to the old cave j 
decause they supposed the savages would go directly thither 
$a soon as it was day, to play the old game over again 
diough they did not now land within two leagues of it. Id 
die next place, they drove away all the flocks of goats thej 
t&d at the old bower, as I called it, which belonged to the 
Spaniards ; and, in short, left as little appearance of inhabitants 
any where as was possible ; and the next morning early they 
posted themselves, with all their force, at the plantation of the 
two men, to wait for their coming. As they guessed, so it hap- 
pened ; these new invaders leaving their canoes at the east 
end of the island, came ranging ^'long the shore, directly 
towards the place, to the number of two hundred and fifty, 
as near as our men could judge. Our army was but small, 
indeed ; but that which was worse, they had not arms foi 
all their number neither. The whole account, it seems, 
stood thus ; first, as to men, seventeen Spaniards, five 
Englishmen, old Friday, or Friday's father, the three slavet 
taken with the women, who proved very faithful, and three 
other slaves, who lived with the Spaniards. To arm these, 
they had eleven muskets, ^ve pistols, three fowling-pieces, 
five muskets or fowling-pieces which were taken hy me from 
the mutinous seamen whom I reduced, two swords, and three 
old halberds. 

To their slaves they did not give either musket or fusee, 
but they had every one a halberd, or a long staff, like a 
quarter-staff, with a great spike of iron fastened into each 
end of it, and by his side a hatchet ; also every one of oui 
men had a hatchet. Two of the women could not be pre- 
vailed upon but they would come into the fight, and they 
had bows and arrows, which the P/paniards had taken fron 



124 ADVENTURES OF 

tae savages when the first action happened, which 1 hava 
ipoken of, where the Indians fuug^ht with one another ; and 
che women had hatchets too. 

The Spaniard governor, whom I described so often, com- 
manded the whole : and Will Atkins, who, though a dread- 
ful fellow for wickedness, was a most daring, bold fellow, 
commanded under him. The savaged came forward like 
lions ; and our men, which was the worst of their fate, had 
no advantage in their situation ; only that Will Atkins, who 
now proved a most useful fellow, with six men, was planted 
just behind a small thicket of bushes, as an advanced guard, 
with orders to let the first of them pass by, and then fire 
into the middle of them, and as soon as he had fired, to 
make his retreat as nimble as he could round a part of the 
wood, and so coute in behind the Spaniards, where they 
stood, having a thicket of trees before them. 

When the savages came on, they ran straggling about 
every way in heaps, out of all manner of order, and Will 
Atkins let about fifty of them pass by him ; then seeing the 
rest come in a very thick throng, he orders three of his men 
to fire, having loaded their muskets with six or seven bullets 
a piece, about as big as large pistol-bullets. How many 
they killed or wounded they knew not, but the consterna- 
tion and surprise was inexpressible among the savages ; they 
were frightened to the last degree to hear such a dreadful 
noise, and see their men killed, and others hurt, but see 
nobody that did it : when, in the middle of their fright, Will 
Atkins and his other three let fly again among the thickest 
of them ; and in less than a minute the first three being 
loaded again, gavcT them a third volley. 

Had Will Atkins and his men retired immediately, as 
loon as they had fired, as they were ordered to do, or had 
Jke re&t of the body been at hand, to h ive noured in theii 
shot ccntinually, the savages had been effectually routed; 
br the terror that *vas among them came principally from 



ROBINSON CllUSOfi. 431 

this, viz., that they were killed by the gods with thuudei 
and lightning, and coiild see nobody that hurt them ; but 
Will Atkins, staying to load again, discovered the cheat; 
some of the savages who were at a distance spying them, 
came upon them behind ; and though Atkins and his men 
fired at them also, two or three times, and killed above 
twenty, retiring as fast as they could, yet they wounded 
Atkins himself, and killed one of his fellow-Knglishraen, 
with their arrows, as they did afterwards one Spaniard, and 
one of the Indian slaves who came with the women. This 
slave was a most gallant fellow, and fought most desperately, 
killing five of them with his own hand, having no weapon 
but one of the armed staves and a hatchet. 

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and 
two other men killed, retreated to a rising ground in the 
wood ; and the Spaniards, after firing three volleys upoE 
them, retreated also ; for their number was so great, and 
they were so desperate, that though above fifty of them 
were killed, and more than as many wounded, yet they 
came on in the teeth of our men, fearless of danger, and 
shot their arrows like a cloud ; and it was observed that 
their wounded men, who were not quite disabled, were made 
outrageous by their wounds, and fought like madmen. 

When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the 
Englbhman that were killed behind them ; and the savages, 
when they came up to them, killed them over again in a 
wretched manner, breaking their arms, legs, and heads, with 
iheir clubs and wooden swords, like true savages ; but find- 
ing our men were gone, they did not seem to pursue them, 
but drew themselves up in a ring, which is, it seems, their 
custom, and shouted twice, in token of their victory ; after 
which, they had the mortification to see several of i\ eb 
wounded men fall, dying with the mere loss of blood. 

The Spaniard governor having drawn his U tie body up 
together upon a rising ground, Atkins, though he wai 
36* 



426 ADVENTURES OP 

wounded, woild have b'^d them march and charge aguin »w 
together at once : but the Spaniard replied, Senhor Atkina. 
you see how their wounded men fight ; let them alone till 
morning ; all the wounded men will be stiff and sore with 
Iheir wounds, and faint with the loss of blood ; and so we 
shall have the fewer to engage. This advice was good ; but 
Will Atkins replied merrily. That is true, senhor, and so 
ghall 1 too ; and that is the reason 1 would go on while ] 
im warm. — Well, Senhor Atkins, says the Spaniard, you 
have behaved gallantly, and done your part : we will fighl 
for you, if you cannot come on ; but 1 think it best to stay 
till morning ; so they waited. 

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they found 
the savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded 
men, and a great noise and hurry among them where they 
lay, they afterwards resolved to fall upon them in the night ; 
especially if they could come to give them but one volley 
before they were discovered, which they had a fair opportu- 
nity to do ; for one of the Englishmen, in whose quartei 
it was where the fight began, led them around between the 
woods and the seaside westward, and then turning short 
south, they came so near where the thickest of them lay, 
that, before they were seen or heard, eight of them fired m 
among them, and did dreadful execution upon them; in 
half a minute more, eight others fired after them, pouring in 
their small shot in such quantity, that abundance were killed 
and wounded ; and all this while they were not able to see 
who hurt them, or which way to fly. 

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition, 
and then divided themselves in three bodies, and resolved tc 
fisdl in among them all together. They had in each body 
eight persons, that is to say, twenty-two and the two 
women, who, by the way, fought desperately. They livided 
the fire-arms equally in each party, and so the halberds and 
Itaies. They would have had the women kept back, lal 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 4^1 

kh<y sail they were resolved to die with then husbands. 
Havidg thus formed their little army, they marched out from 
among the trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy, shout- 
ing and hallooi? g as loud as they could : the savages stood 
altogether, but were in the utmost confusion, hearing the 
noise of our men shouting from three quarters together : 
ihey would have fought if they had seen us ; for as soon ai 
we came near enough to be seen, some arrows were/shot, 
and poor old Friday was wounded, though not dangerously ; 
but our men gave them no time, but, running up to them, 
fired among them three ways, and then fell in with the butt- 
ends of their muskets, their swords, armed staves, and 
hatchets, and laid about them so well, that in a word, they 
set up a dismal screaming and howling, flying to save their 
lives which way soever they could. 

Our men were tired with the execution, and killed or 
mortally wounded in the two fights about one hundred and 
eighty of them ; the rest being frightened out of their wits, 
scoured through the woods and over the hills, with all the 
speed fear and nimble feet could help them to : and as we 
did not trouble ourselves much to pursue them, they got all 
together to the seaside where they landed, and where theii 
canoes lay. But their disasters were not at an end yet ; for 
it blew a terrible storm of wind that evening from the sea, 
so that it was impossible for them to go off; nay, the storm 
continuing all night, when the tide came up, their canoes 
were most of them driven by tl^e surge of the sea so high 
upon the shore, that it required infinite toil to get them ofl^; 
and some of them were even dashed to pieces against the 
beach, or against one another. 

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little rest 
that night ; but having refreshed themselves as well as they 
eooll, they resolved to march to that part of the island 
wh^re the savages were fled, and see what posture they were 
to. THis iieo3ssari)r led them over the place where th« 



480 A^OVENTLRES OJ 

aiercy, thjy fell to work with their canoes, and de8tro)ed 
them evei y one that the storm had not destroyed before ; a1 
the sight of which the savages raised a hideous cry in the 
woods, which our people heard plain enough, after which 
they ran about the island like distracted men : so that, in a 
word, our men did not really know at first what to do with 
them. Not did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, con- 
sider, that while they made those people thus desperate, 
they ought to have kept a good guard at the same time upon 
their plantations ; for though, it is true, they had driven 
away their cattle, and the Indians did not find out their 
main retreat, I mean my old castle at the hill, nor the cave 
in the valley, yet they found out my plantation at the bower, 
and pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences and planting 
about it ; trod all the corn under foot, tore up the vines and 
grapes, being just then almost ripe, and did our men an 
inestimable damage, though to themselves not one farthing^B 
worth of service. 

Though our men were able to fight them upon all occa- 
sions, yet they were in no condition to pursue them, or 
hunt them up and down ; for as they were too nimble of 
foot for our men, when they found them single, so our men 
durst not go abroad single for fear of being surrounded with 
their numbers. The best was, they hud no weapons ; for 
though they had bows, they had no arrows left, nor any ma- 
terials to make any ; nor had they any edge tool or weapon 
among them. 

Tha extremity and distress they were reduced to wm 
great and indeed deplorable; but, at the same time, our 
men were also brought to very bad circumstances by them : for 
though their retreats were preserved, yet their provision wai 
destroyed, and their harvest spoiled ; and what to do, or which 
pray to turn themselves, they knew not. The only refuge 
chey had now was, the stock of cattle they had in the valley 
by the ca -e, and some little corn which grew there, and the 



ROBINSON CKUSOB. 4^1 

plantation of the three Englishmen, Will 4tkin8 and hii 
eomrades, who were now reduced to two; one of them 
Deing killed by an arrow, which struck him on the side ol 
his head, just under the temples, so tfiat he never spoke 
more : and it w^s very remarkable, that this was the same 
barbarous felloe that cut the poor savage slave with hit 
hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have murdered the 
Spaniards. 

I looked upon their case to have been worse at this time 
than mine was at any time, after I first discovered the grains 
of barley and rice, and got into the manner of planting and 
raising my com, and my tame cattle : for now they had, as I 
may say, a hundred wolves upon the island, which would 
devour everything they could come at, yet could be hardly 
come at themselves. 

When they saw what their circumstances were, the first 
thing they concluded was, that they would if possible, drive 
them up to the farther part of the island, south-west, that it 
any more savages came on shore they might not find one 
another : then they would daily hunt and harass them, and 
kill as many of them as they could come at, till they had 
reduced their number ; and if they could at last tame them, 
and bring them to anything, they would give them corn, and 
teach them how to plant, and live upon their daily labor. 

In order to do this, they so followed them, and so terrified 
them with their guns, that in a few days, if any of them 
fired a gun at^an Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he would 
fall down for fear ; and so dreadfully frightened they were, 
I hat they kept out of sight farther and farther ; till, at last, 
our men following them, and almost every day killing oi 
wounding some of them, they kept up in the woods or hol- 
low places so much, that it reduced them to the utmost 
(nisery for want of food ; and many were afterwards found dead 
M the woods, without any hurt, absolutely starved to death. 

l^lTien our men found this, it made their hearts relent, and 



132 ADVENTUllRS OF 

pity moved them, especially the Spanish governor, wha 
was che most gentleman-like, generous-mimled man that 1 
ever met with in my life ; and he proposed, if possible, to 
take one of them auve, and bring him ^-o understand what 
they meant, so far as to be able to act as interpreter, and go 
dmong them, and see if they might be brought to some ccn 
ditions that might be depended upon, to save their lives and 
dc us no harm. 

It was some while before any of them could be taken; 
but bein;^ weak and half-starved, one of them was at last 
surprised and made a prisoner. He was sullen at first, and 
would neither eat nor drink ; * but finding himself kindl)f 
used, and victuals given him, and no violence offered him, 
he at last grew tractable, and came to himself. They 
brought old Friday to him, who talked often with him, and 
told him how kind the others would be to them all : that 
they would not only save their lives, but would give them 
part of the island to live in, provided they would give satis- 
faction that they would keep in their own bounds and not 
come beyond it to injure or prejudice others; and that they 
should have corn given them to plant and make it grow for 
tneir bregxl, and some bread given them for their present 
subsistence ; and old Friday bade the fellow go and talk 
with the rest of his country, and see what they said to it ; 
assuring them, that if they did not agree immediately, thev 
should be all destroyed. 

The poor wretches thoroughly humbled, and reduced in 
number to about thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at the* 
nrst offer, and begged to have some food given them ; upon 
which, twelve Spaniards and two Englishmen, well armed, 
with three Indian slaves and old Friday, marched to the 
place where they were. The three Indians slaves carried 
them a large quantity of bread, some rice boiled up to cakea 
tnd dried in the sun, and three live goats ; and they were 
)rdercd to go to the side of a hill, where they sat down, atf 



ItOBlNSON CRUSOE. 433 

tbeir p.ovisions very thankfully, and were tae most faithful 
f«;ilow8 to their words that could be thought of: for, except 
u hen they came to beg victuals and directions, they never 
Cvme out of their bounds : and there they lived when I came 
i<* the island, and I wert to see them. 

1 hey had taught thjm both to plant com, make bread* 
bi eed tame goats, and milk them : they wanted nothing but 
wives, and they soon would have been a nation. They were 
confined to a neck of land, surrounded with high rocks 
behind them, and lying plain towards the sea before them, 
on the south-east corner of the island. They had land 
-enough, and it was very good and fruitful ; about a mile and 
a half broad, and three or four miles in length. 

Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such as I 
made for myself, and gave among them twelve hatchets and 
three or four knives ; and there they lived, the most sub- 
jected innocent creatures that ever were heard of. 

After this, the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity with 
respect to the savages till 1 cam^ *: reidsit them, which was 
about two years after ; not but that, now and then, some 
canoes of savages came on shore for their triumphal, un- 
natural feasts ; but as they were of several nations, and 
perhaps had never heard of those that came before, or the 
reason of it, they did not make any search or inquiry after 
their countrymen ; and if they had, it would have been very 
hard to have found them out. 

Thus, 1 think, I have given a full account of all that hap- 
pened to them till my return, at least, that was worth notice. 
The Indians 01 savages were wonderfully civilized by them, 
and they frequency went among them ; but forbade, on 
pain of death, an> one of the Indians coming to them, 
because they would not have their settlement betrayed 
again. One thing was very remarkable, viz., that they 
taught the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets, but 
they toon outdid their masters ; for they made abundance ol 
37 



tS4 ADVENTURKS OF 

ndusl ingenious things in wicker-work, particu'Jarly ill sort! 
of baskets, sieves, bird-cages, cupboards, &c. ; as also chairi 
to sit on, stools, beds, couches, and abundance of othei 
things, being very ingenious at such work, when they weri 
on re put in ths way of it. 

My coming was a particular relief to these people, becausi 
we furnished them with knives, scissors, spades, shovels 
pitk-ases, and all things of that kind which they couU 
wan'. With the help of those too's they were so verj 
handy, that they came at last to budd up their huts, oi 
houses, very handsomely, raddling or working it up like 
basket-work all the way round : which was a very extraor- 
dinary piece of ingenuity, and looked very odd, but was an 
exceeding good fence, as well against heat as against all 
sorts of vermin ; and our men were so taken with it, that 
they got the wild savages to come and do the like for them ; 
so that when I came to see the two Englishmen's colonies, 
they looked, at a distance, as if they all lived like bees in a 
hive. As foi Will Atkins, who was now become a very 
industrious, useful, and sober fellow, he had made himseU 
such a tent of basket-work as, I believe, was never seen : it 
was one hundred and twenty paces round on the outside, a€ 
I measured by my steps ; the walls were as close worked a a 
a basket, in panels or squares of thirty-two in number, and 
very Strong, standing about seven feet high ; in the middle 
was another not above twenty-two paces round, but bull* 
stronger, being octagon in its form, and in the eight comers 
stood eight very strong posts ; round the top of which he 
laid strong pieces, pinned together with wooden pins, from 
which he raised a pyramid for a roof of eight rafters, very 
handsome, I assure you, and joined together very welU 
though he had no nails, and only a few iron spikes, which 
he made himself too, out of the old iron that I left ttere ; 
and, indeed, this fellow showed abundance of ingenuity 'in 
•ftTe*al things which he had no \nowledge of: he made hiw 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 451 

i hige, with a pair of wooden bellows to olow tie fire ; q« 
made himself charcoal for his work ; and he formed out oi 
Die iron crows a middling good anril to hammer upon : in 
this manner he made many things, but especially hodks, 
staples and spikes, bolts and hinges. — But, to return to the 
house. After he had pitched the roof of his innermost tent, 
he worked it up between the rafters with basket-work, so 
firm, and thatched that over again so ingeniously with rice- 
straw, and over that a large leaf of a tree, which covered 
the top, that his house was as dry as if it had been entiled 
or slated. Indeed, he owned that the savages had made the 
basket-work for him. The outer circuit was covered as a 
lean-to, all round this inner apartment, and long rafters lay 
from the thirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner 
house, being about twenty feet distant ; so that there was a 
space like a walk within the outer wicker wall and without 
the inner, near twenty feet wide. 

The inner place he partitioned off with the ^ame wicker- 
work, but much fairer, and divided into six apartments, so 
that he had six rooms on a floor, and out of every one ol 
these there was a door ; first into the entry, or coming into 
the main tent, another door into the main tent, and another 
door into the space or walk that was round it ; so that walk 
was also divided into six equal parts, which served not only 
for a retreat, but to store up any necessaries which the family 
had occasion for. These six spaces not taking up the whole 
circumference, what other apartments the outer circle had 
were thus ordered : — As soon as you were in at the door of 
the outer circle, you had a short passage straight before you 
to the door of the inner house ; but on either side was a 
wicker partition, and a door in it, by which you went first 
into a large room or storehouse, twenty feet wide, and about 
thirty feet long, and through that into another, not quite so 
ong : so that in the outer circle were ten handsome r3(ina, 
•ix of which were only to be come at through the apait 



130 ADVENTURES OF 

ments of the inner tent, and served as closets or retitini 
rooms to the respective chambers of the inner circle ; and 
i^ui large warehouses, or bams, or what you please to caL 
them, which went through one another, two on either hand 
3f the passage that led through the outer door to the inner 
tent. 

Such a piece of basket-work, 1 believe, was never seen in 
the world, nor a house or tent so neatly contrived, much less 
80 built. In this great bee-hive lived the three families, that 
is to say, Will Atkins and his companion ; the third was 
killed, but his wife remained, with three children, for she 
was, it seems, big xvith child when he died ; and the other 
two were not at all backward to give the widow her full 
share of every thing, I mean as to their corn, milk, grapes, 
5wj., and when they killed a kid, or found a turtle on the 
shore ; so that they all lived well enough ; though, it was 
true, they were not so industrious as the other two, as has 
^en observed already. 

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz., that, as for 
religion, I do not know that there was anything of that 
kind among them : they often, indeed, put one another in 
mind that there was a God, by the very common method of 
seamen, viz., swearing by his name ; nor were their poor 
ignorant savage wives much better for having been married 
to Christians, as we must call them ; for as they knew very 
little of God themselves, so they were utterly incapable of 
entering into any discourse with their wives about a Goa, or 
to talk anything to them concerning religion. 

The utmost of all the improvement which I can say the 
wives had made from them was, that they had taught them 
to speak English pretty well ; and most of their children, 
which were near wenty in all, were taught to speak English 
too, fiom their first learning to speak, though they at first 
ipoke it in a very broken manner, like their mothers. Thera 
iras none of these child -n above six years old when I came

Mtner for it was not much above seven years tha they had 
fetched these five savage ladies over ; but they had all been 
pretty fruitful, for -they had all children, more or less ; 1 
think the cook*s mate*s wife was big of her sixth child ; and 
the mothers were all a good sort of well-goTemed, quiet^ 
laborious women, modest and decent, helpful to one another, 
mighty observant and subject to their masters (1 cannot call 
them husbands), and wanted nothing but to be well instructed 
in the Christian religion, and to be legally married ; both 
which were happily brought about afterwards by my means 
or, at least, in consequence of my coming among them.

Having thus given an account of the colony in general, 
and pretty much of my runagate English, I must say some- 
thing of the Spaniards, who were the main body of the 
family, and in whose story there are some incidents also 
remarkable enough. 

I had a great many discourses with them about their cir- 
cumstances when they were among the fcavages. They told 
me readily that they had no instances to give of their appli- 
cation or ingenuity in that country ; that they were a poor, 
miserable, dejected handful of people ; that if means had 
been put into their hands, yet they had so abandoned them- 
selves to despair, and so simk under the weight of theii 
misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but starving

winced they were in the wrong ; that it was not the pait o 
wisp nen to give themselves up to their misery, but alw&yi 
vO take hold of the helps which reason' offered, as well foi 
present support as for future deliverance : he told me that 
grief was the most senseless insignificant passion in the 
world, for that it regarded only things past, which were 
generally impossible to be recalled, or to be remedied, but 
had no views of things to come, and had no share in any- 
thing that looked like deliverance, but rather added to the 
affliction than proposed a remedy ; and upon this he repeated 
a Spanish proverb, which though I cannot repeat in just the 
same words that he spoke it in, yet I remember I made it 
into an English proverb of my own, thus : 

In trouble to be troubled, 

Is to have your trouble doubled. 

He ran on then in remarks upon all the little improve 
ments I had made in my solitude ; my unwearied applica- 
tion, as he called it ; and how I hud made a condition which 
in its circumstances was at first much worse than theirs, a 
thousand times more happy than theirs was, even now when 
they were all together. He told me it was remarkable that 
Englishmen had a greater presence of mind, in their dis- 
tress, than any people that he ever met with : that their un- 
happy nation aad the Portuguese were the worst men in the 
world to struggle with misfortunes ; for that their first step 
in dangers, after the common efforts were over, was to 
despair, lie down under it, and die, without rousing tncii 
thoughts up to proper remedies for escape. 

I told him their case and mine differed exceedingly ; that 
they were cast upon the shore without necessaries, without 
supply of food, or present sustenance till they could provide 
it ; that, it was *rue, I Lad this disadvantage and discom- 
fort, that I was alone ; but then the supplies I had provi- 
ientially throwr into my hands, by the un?x]-:>cted drivinff 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 439 

»f the 8hi| on shore, was sucii a help as would ha\€ en- 
fouraged aty creature in the ^\orld to have applird hin^^eli 
kB I had done. Senhor, says the Spaniard, had we poor 
Spaniards been in your case, we should never have got hali 
those things out of the ship, as you did : nay, says he, we 
mould never have found means to have got a raft to carry 
•Jiem, or to have got the raft on shore without boat or sail ; 
and how much less should we have done if any of us had 
oeen alone ! Well, I desired him to abate his compliment, 
ind go on with the history of their coming on shore, where 
they landed. He told me they unhappily landed at a place 
where there were people without provisions ; whereas, had 
bhey had the common sense to have put off to sea again, 
and gone to another island a little farther, they had found 
provisions, though without people ; there being an island 
that way, as they had been told, where there were provisions, 
though no people ; that is to say, that the Spaniards of 
Trinidad had frequently been there, and had filled the island 
with goats and hogs at several times, where they had bred 
in such multitudes, and where turtle and seafowls were in 
suci* plenty, that they could have been in no want of flesh, 
though they had found no bread ; whereas here, they were 
only sustained with a few roots and herbs,. which they un- 
derstood not, and which had no substance in them, and 
which toe innabitants gave them sparingly enough : and 
who coiila treat them no better, unless they would turn 
cannibals, ana eat men's flesh, which was the great dainty of 
their country. 

They gave me an account how many ways they strove to 
ei^Uize the savages they were with, and ^o teach them 
rational customs in the ordinary way of living, but in vain ; 
tnd how they retorted it upon them, as unjust, that they, 
who came thcie for assistance and support, should attempt 
lo set up for instruct -»rs of those that gave them food; 
ntimatiig, it «eems that rone shoull set up for th« 



440 ADVENTURES OF 

instructors of others but tKose who could live «<ithoik 
them. 

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities the) 
were driven to ; how sometimes they were many days with- 
out any food at all, the island they were upon being in- 
habited by a sort of savages that lived more indolent, and 
for that reason were less supplied with the necessaries oi 
life, than they had reason to believe others were in the same 
part of the world ; and yet they found that these savages 
were less ravenous and voracious than those who had better 
supplies of food. Also they added, they could not but see 
with what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness the gov> 
eming providence of God directs the events of things in the 
world ; which, they said, appeared in their circumstances ; 
for if, pressed by the hardships they were under, and the 
barrenness of the country where they were, they had 
searched after a better to live in, they had then been out ot 
the way of the relief that happened to them by my means. 

They then gave me an account how the savages whom 
they lived among expected them to go out with them into 
their wars ; and, it was true, that as they had fire arms with 
them, had they not had the disaster to lose their ammuni- 
tion, they should have been serviceable not only to theii 
friends, but have made themselves terrible both to friends 
and enemies ; but being without powder and shot, and yd 
in a condition that they could not in reason deny to go out 
with their landlords to their wars, so when they came into 
the field of battle, they were in a worse condition than the 
savages themselves : for they had neither bows nor arrows, 
nor could they use those the savages gave them ; so they 
could do nothing but stand still, and be wounded with 
arrows, till they came up to the teeth of their enemy ; and 
then mdeed, the three halberds they had were of use to 
ilem ; and they would often drive a whole littk army before 
ihem wi*:h th'^se halberds, and sharpened sticki put into th% 



ROBINSON CRl 80E. 44I 

muzzles ol theii muskets : but tha:, for all this, they wew 
sometimes surrounded with multitudes, .and in great dangei 
from their arrows, till at last they found the way to make 
themselves large targets of wood, which they covered with 
i>kins of wild beasts, whose names they knew not, and 
these covered them from the arrows of the savages : yet, 
notwithstanding these, they were sometimes in great dan- 
ger; and five of them were once knocked down togethet 
with the clubs of the savages, which was the time when one 
of them was taken prisoner, that is to say, the Spaniard 
whom I had relieved : that at first they thought he had been 
killed ; but when they afterwards heard he was taken pris- 
oner, they were under the greatest grief imaginable, and 
would willingly have all ventured their lives to have rescued 
him. 

They told me that when they were so knocked down, Le 
rest of their company rescued them, and stood over them 
fighting till they were come to themselves, all but him who 
they thought had been dead ; and then they made their way 
with their halberds and pieces, standing close together in & 
line, through a body of above a thousand savages, beating 
down all that came in their way, got the victory over their 
enemies, but to their great sorrow, because it was with the 
loss of their friend, whom the other party, finding him alive, 
carried off*, with some others, as I gave an account before. 

They described most affectionately how they were sur- 
prised with joy at the return of their friend and companion 
in misery, who, they thought, had been devoured by wild 
beasts of the worst kind, viz., by wild men ; and yet hew 
more and more they were surprised with the account he gave, 
them of his errand, and that there was a Christian in any 
place near, much more one that was able, and had humanity 
enough, io contribute to their deliverance. 

They described how they were astonished at the sight ol 
*be relief I sent them, and at the appearan:e of loaves ol

Dread, tliingg chey had not seen since their coming tc i\ji 
miserable pLice: huw often they crossed it and blessed it as 
bread sent from Hejiven ; and what a reviving cordial it w%i 
to their spirits to taste it, as also the other things I had sent 
for their supply ; and, after all, they would have told me 
something of the joy they were in at the sight of a boat 
and pilots, to carry them away to the person and place from 
whence all these new comforts came, but it was impossible tc 
ei.press it by words, for their excessive joy naturally driving 
them to unbecoming extravagances, they had no way to 
describe them, but by telling me they bordered upon lunacy, 
having no way to give vent to their passions suitable to the 
sense that was upon them ; that in some it worked one way, 
and in some another ; and that some of them, through a 
surprise of joy, would burst into tears, others be stark mad, 
and others immediately faint. This discourse extremely 
affected me, and culled to my mind Friday's ecstasy when 
he met his father, and the poor people's ecstacy when I took 
them up at sea after their ship was on fire ; the joy of the 
mate of the ship when he found himself delivered in the 
place where he expected to perish ; and my own joy, when, 
after twenty-eight years* captivity, I found a good ship 
ready to carry me to my own country. All these thingw 
made me more sensible of the relation of these poor men. 
and more affected with it. 

Having thus given a view of the state of things as 1 
found them, I must relate the heads of what I did for these 
people, aijd the condition in which I left them. It was theii 
opinion, and mine, too, that they would be troubled no more 
with the savages, or, if they were, they would be able to 
cut them off, if they were twice as many as before ; so they 
had no concern about that. Then I entered mto a serious 
discourse with the Spaniard, whom I call governor, aboui 
their stay in the island ; for as I was not come to carry any * 
»f them off, so it would not le just to carry off some and

leare othera, who, perhaps, would be unwilling to sta^ ii 
their strength was iimiuished. On the other hand, 1 told 
th^m I came to establish them there, not to remo\c them: 
an.l then I let them know that I had brought with me relie! 
of sundry kinds fcr them ; th^it I had been at a great charge- 
to supply them with all things necessary, as well for thcii 
^nvenience as their defence ; and that 1 had such and su^'b 
particular persons with me, as well to increase and recruit 
their number, as by the particular necessary employment? 
which they were bred to, being artificers, to assist them in 
those things in which at present they were in want. 

They were all together when I talked thus to them ; and 
before I delivered to them the stores I had brought, I asked 
them, one by one, if they had entirely forgot and buried the 
first animosities that had been among them, and would shake 
nands with one another, and engage in a strict friendship 
and union of interest, that so there might be no more mis- 
understandings and jealousies. 

Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and good-humor 
said, they had met with afliiction enough to make them ah 
sober, and enemies enough to make them all friends ; that, 
for his part, he would live and die with them ; and was so 
far from designing anything c gainst the Spaniards, that he 
ownc^d they. had done nothing to him but what his own mad 
humor made necessary, and what he would have done, and 
perhaps worse, in their case ; and that he would ask them 
pardon, if 1 desired it, for the foolish and brutish things he 
had done to them, and was very willing and desirous ol^ 
living in terms of entire friendship and union with them, 
and would do anything that lay in his power to convince 
them of it : and as for going to England, he cared not if he 
did not go thither these twenty years. 

The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at first disarmed and 
excluded Will Atkins and his two countrymen fcr their ill 
loiiduct, a§ they had let me know, and they appealed to m^

{or the necessity they were under to do so; bat that WiB 
Atkins hud behaved himself so bravely in the great fighi 
they had with the savages, and on several occasions since, 
uid ha 1 showed himself so faithful to, and concerned for, 
Uie general interest of them all, that they had forgotten all 
that was past, and thought he merited as much to be trusted 
with arms, and supplied with necessaries, as any of them : 
and they had testified their satisfaction in him, by commit- 
ting the command to him, next to the governor himself; and 
as they had entire confidence in him, and all his country- 
men, so they acknowledged they had merited that confidence 
by all the methods that honest men could merit to be valued 
and trusted ; and they most heartily embraced the occasion 
of giving me this assurance, that they would never have any 
interest separate fi'om one another. 

Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship, we 
appointed the next day to dine all together ; and, indeed, 
we made a splendid feast. I caused the ship*8 cook and his 
mate to come on shore and dress our dinner, and the old 
cook*s mate we had on shore assisted. We brought on shore 
MX pieces of good beef, and four pieces of pork, out of the 
8hip*s provision, with our punchbowl, and materials to fill 
it ; and, in particular, I gave them ten bottles of French 
claret, and ten bottles of English beer: things •that neither 
the Spaniards nor the English had tasted for many years, and 
which, it may be supposed, they were very glad of. The 
Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids, which the cookt 
roasted : and three of them were sent, covered up close, 
on ooard the ship to the seamen, that they might feast on 
fresh meat from on shore, as we did with their salt meat horn 
on board. 

After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, 
I brought out my cargo of goods : wherein that there mighl 
be no dispute about dividing, I showed them that there wai 
a a^fificiency *)r them all, desiring that they might all t^kt 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 445 

Ml equjd quantity of the goods that were foi wearing : thai 
IS to say, equal when made up. As, first, I distributed linen 
iufficient to make every one of them four shiits, and, at the 
Spaniard's request, afterwards made them up six : these were 
exceedingly comfortable to them, having been what, as 1 may 
«ay, they had long since forgot the use of, or what it was to 
wear them. I allotted the English thin stuffs, which 1 men- 
tioned before, to make every one a light cout like a frock, 
which I judged fittest for the heat of the season, cool and 
loose ; and ordered that whenever they decayed they should 
make more, as they thought fit ; the like for pumps, shoes, 
btockings, hats, &c. 

I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction, sat upon 
the countenances of all these poor men, when they saw the 
care I had taken of them, and how well I had furnished 
chem. They told me I was a father to them ; and that hav- 
mg such a correspondent as I was in so remote a part of the 
world, it would make them forget that they were left in a 
desolate place ; and they all voluntarily engaged to me not 
«o leave the place without my consent. 

Then I presented to them the people I had brought with 
me, particularly the tailor, the smith, and the two carpen- 
ters, all of them most necessary people ; but, above all, my 
general artificer, than whom they could not name anything 
that was more useful to them : and the tailor, to show his 
concern for them, went to work immediately, and, with my 
leave, made them every one a shirt, the first thing he did ; 
and, which was still more, he taught the women not only 
how to sew and stitch, and use the needle, but made them 
assist to make the shirts for their husbands, and for all the rest. 

As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful 
they were ; for they took to peices all my clumsy, unhandy 
things, and made them clever convenient tables, stc ols, bed- 
iteads, cupboirds, lockers, shelves, and everything they 
wanted of tha kind. But, to let them see how nature mad^ 
38 



146 ADVENTURES OF 

artificers at first, I carried the carpenter to see Will AtkinM'i 
basket-house, as I ciUed it : and they both owned thej 
never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity before, noi 
anything so regular and so handily built, at least of its kind : 
and one of them, when he saw it, after musing a good while 
turning about to me, 1 am sure, says he, that man has no 
need of us ; you need do nothing but give him tools. 

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and garc 
every man a digging-spade, a shovel, and a take, for we had 
no harrows or ploughs ; and to every separate place a pick- 
axe, a crow, a broad axe, and a saw ; always appointing, 
that as often as any were broken or worn out, they should 
be supplied, without grudging, out of the general stores that 
1 left behind. Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, 
knives, scissors, and all sorts of iron-work, they had with- 
out tale, as they required : for no man would take more than 
ne wanted, and he must be a fool that would waste or spoil 
them on any account whatever; and, for the use of the 
Emith, I left two tons of un wrought iron for a supply. 

My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them 
was such, even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice 
at them : for now they could march as I used to do, with a 
musket upon each shoulder, if there was occasion ; and were 
able to fight a thousand savages, if they had but some little 
advantages of situation, which also they could not miss, if 
they had occasion. 

I carried on shore with me the young man whose mothet 
was starved to death, and the maid also ; she was a sober, 
well educated, religious young woman, and behaved so inof- 
fensively, that every one gave her a good word ; she had, 
indeed, an unhappy life with us, there being no woman in 
the ship but herself, but she bore it with patience. After a 
while, seeing things so well ordered, and in so fine a way o1

hr taking so long a voyage ; I say, comsidering all this, both 
of them came to me, and desired I would give them leave ti 
remain on the island, and be entered among my family, at 
they called it. 1 agreed to this readily ; and they had s 
little plot of ground allotted to them, where they had three 
tents or jouses set up, surrounded with a basket-work, pal- 
lisadoec like Atkins's, adjoining to his plantation. Thcii 
tents were contrived so that they had each of them a room 
apart to lodge in, and a middle tent, like a great store-house, 
to lay their goods in, and to eat and drink in. And now the 
'^♦ber two Englishmen removed their habitation to the same 
place ; and so the island was divided into three colonies, and 
no more, viz., the Spaniards, with old Friday, and the hrsl 
servants, at my old habitation under the hill, which was, in 
a word, the capital city ; and where they had so enlarged 
and extended their works, as well under as on the outside o\ 
the hill, that they lived, though perfectly concealed, yet full 
at large. Never was there such a little city in a wood, and 
BO hid, in any part of the world : for I verily believe a 
thousand men might have ranged the island a month, and, if 
they had not known there was such a thing, and looked on 
purpose for it, they would not have found it ; for the trees 
stood 80 thick and so close, and grew so fast-woven one into 
another, that nothing but cutting them down first could dis- 
cover the place, except the only two narrow entrances where 
they went in and out could be found, which was not very 
•asy: one of them was close down at the water's edge, on 
the side of the creek, and it was afterwards above two hun- 
dred yards to the place ; and the other was up a ladder at 
twice, as I have already formally described it ; and they had 
tlso a large wood thick-planted on the top of the hill, con- 
taining above an acre, which grew apace, and concealed the 
place from all discovery there, with only one narrow place be- 
tween twc trr?s, not easily to be discovered, to enter or 
^iv0t side. 



448 ADVENTURES OF 

The otter colony was that of Will Atkins, where thert 
were four families of Englisnmen, I mean those I had left 
there, with their wives and chLdrcn ; three savages that 
were slaves ; the widow and the children of the Englishman 
that was killed ; the young man and the maid ; and, by the 
way, we made a wife of her before we went away. There 
was also the two carpenters and the tailor, whom I brought 
with me for them ; also the smith, who was a very necessary 
man to them, especially as a gunsmith, to take care of tlieii 
Arms ; and my other man, whom I called Jack-of-all-trades 
who was in himself as good almost as twenty men ; for he 
was not only a very ingenious fellow, but a very merrj 
fellow ; and before I went away we married him to the 
Qonest maid that came with the youth in the ship I men- 
tioned before. 

And now I speak of marrying^ it brings me naturally to 
say something of the French ecclesiastic that I had brought 
with me out of the ship's crew whom I took up at sea. 1*. 
is true, this man was a Roman, and perhaps it may give 
offence to some hereafter, if I leave anything extraordinary 
upon record of a man whom, before I begin, I must (to set 
him out in just colors) represent in terms very much to his dis- 
advantage, in the account of Protestants : as, first, that he 
was a Papist; secondly, a Popish priest; and thirdly, a 
French Popish priest. But justice demands of me to give 
him a due character ; and I must say, ho was a grave, sober, 
pious, and most religious person ; exact in his life, extensive 
in hb charity, and exemplary in almost everything he did. 
What then can any one say against being very sensible oi 
the value of such a man, notwithstanding his profession t 
though it may be my opinion, perhaps, as well as the opinion 
of others who shall read this, that he was mistaken. 

The fiist hour that 1 began to converse with him after he 
bad agreed to go with me to the East Indies, I found reason 
to delight exc3edingly in his conversation uid he first begai

ne crossed hb breast) saved my life, but you have admitted 
me to go this voyage in your ship, and by your obliging 
civility have taken me into your family, giving me an opportu- 
nity of free conversation. Now, sir, you see by my habit what 
my profession is, and I guess by your nation what yours is ; 
[ may think it is my duty, and doubtless it is so, to use my 
almost endeavors, on all occasions, to bring all the souls I 
:an to the knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the Cath« 
olic doctrine ; but as 1 am here under your permission, and 
in your family, I am bound, in justice to your kindness, as 
^ell as in decency and good manners, to be under your gov- 
ernment^ and therefore I shall not, without your leave, enter 
into any debate on the points of religion in which we may 
not agree, farther than you shall give me leave. 

I told him his carriage was so modest, that 'I could not 
but acknowledge it ; that it was true, we were such people as 
they called heretics, but that he was not the first Catholic I 
nad conversed with without falling into inconveniences, or 
carrying the questions to any height in debate ; that he 
should not find himself the worse used for being of a different

dislike on ei^^er ^ide, it should be his fault, not ours. 

He replied, that he thought all our conversation might be 
easily separated from disputes ; that it was not his busincsu 
to cap principles with every man he conversed with ; and 
that he rather desired me to converse with him as a gentle- 
man than as a religionist ; and that, if I would give him leave 
at any time to discourse upon religious subjects, he would 
readily comply with it, and that he did not doubt but 1 
would allow him also to defend his own opinimis as well as 
he could ; but that, without my leave, he would not break 
in upon me with any such thing. He told me farther, that

as a priest as wc- J as a private Christian, to procire the i^ooj 
of the.^hip, and the safety of all that was in her ; and though, 
perhaps, we would not join with him, and he could not praj 
with us, he hoped he might pray for us, which he would do • 
upon aU occasions. In this manner we conversed ; and, ai 
he was of the most obliging, gentleman-like behavior, so he 
was, if I may be allowed to say so, a man of good sense, 
and, as I believe, of great learning. 

He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and ci 
the many extraordinary events of it ; of many adventures 
which had befallen him in the few years that he had been 
abroad in the world ; and particularly this was very remark- 
able, viz., that in the voyage he was now engaged in, he had 
the misfortune to be five times shipped and unshipped, and 
never to go to the place whither any of the ships he was in 
were at first designed. That his first intent was to have 
gone to Martinico, and that he went on board a ship bound 
thither at St. Malo ; but, being forced into Lisbon by bad 
weather, the ship received some damage by running aground 
In the mouth of the river Tagus, and was obliged to unload 
her cargo there ; but finding a Portuguese ship there bound 
to the Madeiras, and ready to sail, and supposing he should 
easily meet with a vessel there bound to Martinico, he went 
on board, in order to sail to the Madeiras ; but the master 
of the Portuguese ship, being but an indifferent mariner, 
had been out of his reckoning, and they drove to Fa\al , 
where, however, he happened to find a very good market fo: 
bb c&rgo, which was corn, and therefore resolved not to go 
to the Madeiras, but to load salt at the isle of May, ird to 
go away to Newfoundland. He had no remedy in this 
exigence but to go with the ship, and had a pretty ^ood 
voyage as f-^ as the Banks (so they call the place where 
they catch the fish) ; where, meeting with a French shif 
bound from France to Quebec, in the river of Canada, ana 
from thence to Martinico, to carry provisions, he thought. h« 



ROBINSON CRUSOE t5\ 

should iav« an opportunity to complete his first design; bul 
when ae came to Quebec the master of the ship died, and 
the vessel proceeded no farther : so the next voyage he 
shipped himself for France, in the ship that was burned 
when we took them up at sea ; and then shipped with us 
for the East Indies, as I have already said. Thus he Lad 
been disappointed in five voyages, all, as I may call it, in 
one voyage, besides what I shall have occasion to mention 
farther of the same person. 

But I shall not make digression into other men's stozies, 
which have no relation to my own : I return to what con- 
eems our affairs in the island.

He came to me one morning, for he lodged among us all 
the while we were upon the island, and it happened to be 
just when I was going to visit the Englishmen's colony, at 
the farthest part of the island ; I say, he came to me, and 
told me with a very grave countenance, that he had for two 
or three days desired an opportunity of some discourse with 
me, which he hoped would not be displeasing to me, because 
he thought it might in some measure correspond with my 
general design, which was, the prosperity of my new colony, 
and perhaps might put it, at least more than he thought if 
was, in the way of God's blessing. 

I looked a little surprised at the last part of his disco»ir8C, 
%nd turning a little sho^t, How, sir, said I, can it be said 



452 ADVENTURES OF 

Uiat we are m t in the way of Gpd's blessing, after i zk 
visible assistances and wonderful deliverances ts we Lave 
•een here, and of which 1 have given you a large account ? 
— If you had pleased, sir, said he, with a world of modesty, 
and yet with great readiness, to have heard me, you would 
have found no room to be displeased, much less to think eo 
bard of me, that I should suggest that you have not had 
wonderful assistances and deliverances ; and I hope, on your 
behalf, that you are in the way of God*s blessing, as your 
design is exceeding good, and will prosper : but, sir, though 
it were more so than is even possible to you, yet there may 
be some among you that are not equally right in their 
actions ; and you know, that in the story of the children ol 
Israel, one Achan in the camp removed God*8 blessing from 
them, and turned his hand so against them, that six-and- 
thirty of them, though not concerned in the crime, were the 
objects of divine vengeance, and bore the weight of that 
punishment. 

I was sensibly touched with his discourse, and told him 
(lis inference was so just, and the whole design seemed so 
fincere, and was really so religious in its own nature, that I 
was very sorry 1 had interrupted him, and begged him to go 
on : and in the mean time, because it seemed that what we 
had both to say might take up some time, I told him I was 
going to the Englishmen's plantations, and asked him to go 
with me, and we might discourse of it by the way. lid 
told me he would the more willingly wait on me thithei^ 
because there partly the thing was acted which he desired to 
•peak to me about ; so we walked on, and I pressed him to 
be free and plain with me in what he had tc safy. 

Why then, sir, says he, be pleased to give me lea%e to lay 
down a few propositions, as the foundation to what I have 
to say, that we may not differ in the general principles, 
though we may be of some differing opinions in the prac ic€ 
of pariculars. P'rst, sir, though we differ in some of th# 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 4^3 

ioctrinal articles of religion, and it is ver) unhappy it b so^ 
Qspecially in the case before us, as I shall show dflerwards. 
yet there are some general principles in which we both agree, 
viz., that there is a God ; and that this God having given ui 
lome stated general rules for our service and obedience, we 
ought not willingly and knowingly to offend him, either by 
neglecting to do what he has commanded, or by doing what 
he has expressly forbidden ; and let our different religions 
be what they will, this general principle is readily owned by 
all, that the blessing of God does not ordinarily follow pre- 
sumptuous sinning against his command ; and every good 
Christian will be affectionately concerned to prevent any that 
are under his care living in a total neglect of God and his 
commands. It is not your men being Protestants, whatever 
my opinion may be of such, that discharges me from being 
concerned for their souls, and from endeavoring, if it lies 
before me, that they should live in as little distance from 
enmity with their Maker as possible, especially if you give 
me leave to meddle so far in your circuit. 

I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told him 
1 granted all he had said, and thanked him that he would 
BO far concern himself for us ; and begged he would explain 
the particulars of what he had observed, that, like Joshua, 
•to take his own parable, I might put away the accursed thing 
from us. 

Why then, sir, says he, I will take the liberty you give 
me ; and there are three things, which, if I am right, must 
stand in the way of God's blessing upon your endeavors 
here, and which I should rejoice, for your sake, and theii 
own, tc see removed : and, sir, I promise myself that you 
u*ill frilly agree with me in them all, as soon as I name 
them; especially because I shall convince you that every 
one of them may, with great case, and very much to youi 
K»tisfaction, be remedied. First, sir, says he, yov» have here

ravages, aud have taken them as their wives, atd hai^e hud 
many children by them all, and yet are not married to them 
after any stated, legal manner, as the laws of God and man 
require ; and therefore are yet, in the sense of bcth, no lesa 
than fornicators, if not living in adultery. To this, sir, 1 
know you will object that there was no clergyman or priest 
of any kind, or of any profession, to perform the ceremony ; 
nor any pen and ink, or paper, to write down a contract ol 
marriage, and have it signed between them : and I know 
also, sir, what the Spaniard governor has told you, I mean, 
of the agreement that he obliged them to make when they 
look those women, viz., that they should choose them out 
by consent, and keep separately to them, which, by the way, 
is nothing of a marriage, no agreement with the women, as 
wives, but only an agreement among themselves, to keep 
them from quarrelling. But, sir, the essence of the sacra- 
ment of matrimony (so he called it, being a Roman) consists 
not only in the mutual consent of the parties to take one 
another as man and wife, but in the formal and legal obliga- 
tion that there is in the contract, to compel the man and 
woman, at all times to own and acknowledge each other ; 
obliging the man to abstain from all other women, to engage 
in no other contract while these subsist, and, on all occa- 
sions, as ability allows, to provide honestly for them and 
their children ; and to oblige the women to the same, or like 
conditions, mutatis mutandis, on their side. Now, sir, says 
he, these men may when they please or when occasion pre- 
sents, abandon these women, disown their children, leave 
them to perish, and take other women, and marry them 
while these are living : and here he added, with some 
vvarmth. How, sir, is God honored in this unlawful liberty ? 
and how shall a blessmg succeed your endeavors in thii 
place, however good in themselves, and however sincere in 
TOUT design, while these men, who at present xte yo tr sub* 



UOBlN«ON CKUSOK. 4^-^ 

jt.cte, uuder your absolute government and do;ninion, are 
allowed by you to live in open adultery ? 

I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but mucL 
more with the convincing arguments he supported it with , 
for it was certainly true, that though they had no clergymai; 
Qpon the spot, yet a formal contract on both sides, made 
before wdtnesses and confirmed by any token which they had 
all agreed to be bound by, though it had been but breaking 
A stick between them, engaging the men to own these women 
for their wives upon all occasions, and never to abandor 
them or their children, and the women to the same with 
their husbands, had been an effectual lawful marriage in the 
sight of Ood ; and it was a great neglect that it was not 
done. But I thought to have got off my young priest by 
telling him that all that part was done when I was not here ; 
and they had lived so many years with them now, that if it 
was adultery, it was past remedy ; they coidd do nothing in 
it now. 

Sir, says he, asking your pardon for such freedom, you 
are right in this, that, it being done in your absence, you 
could not be charged with that part of the crime ; but, I 
beseech you, flatter not yourself that you are not therefore 
under an obligation to do your utmost now to put an end to 
it. How can you think but that, let the time past lie on 
whom it will, all the guilt, for the future, will lie entirely 
upon you ? because it is certainly in your power now to 
put an end to it, and in nobody's power but yours. 

I was so dull still, that I did not take him right ; but J 
unngined that, by putting an end to it, he meant that I 
should part them, and not suffer them to live together any 
longer ; and 1 said to him 1 could not do that, by any 
means, for that it would put the whole island into confusion, 
lie seemed surprised that I should so far mistake him. No, 
<r, says he, I do not mean that you should now separate

them, but legally and effectually marry them low ; and at, 
sir, my way of marrying them may not be easy to reconcilt 
tbc m to, though it will be effectual, even by your own lawa, 
bo your wa} may be as well before God, and as valid among 
men ; I mean, by a written contract signed by both man and 
woman, and by all the witnesses present, which all the laws 
oi Europe would decree to be valid. 

1 was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much sin* 
:crity of zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in his discourse 
lis to his own party or church, and such true warmth foi 
preserving the people that he had no knowledge of or re- 
lation to ; I say, for preserving them from transgressing the 
laws of God, the like of which I had indeed not met with 
any where ; but, recollecting what he had said of marrying 
them by a written contract, which I knew he would stand 
to, I returned it back upon him, and told him, I granted all 
that he had said to be just, and on his part very kind ; that 
I would discourse with the men upon the point now, when 1 
came to them ; and I knew no reason why they should scru- 
ple to let him marry them all, which I knew well enough 
would be granted to be as authentic and valid in England as 
if they were married by one of our own clergymen. What 
was aftei wards done in this matter I shall speak of by it- 
self. 

I then pressed him to tell me what was the second com- 
plaint which he had to make, acknowledging that I was very 
much his debtor for the first, and thanked him heartily for 
it. He told me he would use the same freedom and pl2dn- 
aess in the second, and hoped I would take it as well ; and 
this was, that notwithstanding these English subjects ol 
mine, as he called them, had lived with those women foi 
almost seven years, bed taught them to speak English, and 
even to read it, and that they were, as he perceived, women 
of tolerable understanding, and capable of iuHtruction, yet 
they hac* not, to this hour, taught them anything of th« 



ROBINSON CRUSOI&. 451 

Christian religion, no, not so much as to know that there 
was a God, or a worship, or in what manner God was to be 
served ; or that their own idolatry, and worshipping they 
\new not whom, was false and absurd. This, he said, wai 
an unaccountable neglect, and what God would certainly call 
them to account for, and perhaps, at last, take the work out 
of their handi — he spoke this very affectionately and 
warmly. I am persuaded, says he, had those men lived in 
the savage country whence their wives came, the savages 
would have taken more pains to have brought them to be 
idolaters, and to worship the devil, than any of these men, 
so fiir as 1 can see, have taken with them to teach them the 
knowledge of the true God. Now, sir, said he, though I do 
not acknowledge your religion, or you mine, yet we would 
be glad to see the deviFs servants, and the subjects of his 
kingdom, taught to know the general principles of the 
Christian religion : that they might, at least, hear of God, 
and A Redeemer, and of the resurrection, and of a future 
state, — things which we all believe ; they would have, at 
least, been so much* nearer coming into the bosom of the 
true church than they are now, in the public profession ol 
idolatry and devil-worship. 

I could hold no longer ; I took him in my arms, and 
embraced him with an excess of passion. How far, said I 
to him, have I been from understanding the most essential 
part of a Christian? viz., to love the interest of the Christian 
chuich, and the good of other men's souls : I scarce have 
known what belongs to the being of a Christian. — O, sir, 
do not say so, replied he ; this thing is not your fault. — 
No, said I ; but why did I never lay it to heart as well aa 
you ? — It is not too late yet, said he ; be not too forward 
to condemn yourself. — But what can be done now ? said I ; 
you see 1 am going away. — Will you give me leave to talk 
with the83 poor men about it? — Yes, with all my heart, 
•aid 1 ; and v ilk oblige them to give heed to what you saf 
39

too. — As to that, said he, we must leave then, to the mercj 
of Christ ; but it is your business to assist thein, encouragf 
them, and instruct them ; and if you give me leave, and God 
his blessing, I do not doubt but the poor ignoiant souls shall 
be brought home to the great circle of Christianity, if not 
into the particular faith we all embrace, and that even while 
you stay here. Upon this I said, I shall not only give you 
leave, but give you a thousand thanks for it. What fol- 
lowed on this account I shall mention also again in itf 
place. 

I now pressed him for the third article in which we were 
to blame. Why, really, says he, it is of the same nature ; 
and 1 will proceed, asking your leave, with the same plain- 
ness as before ; it is about your poor saveiges, who are, as I 
may say, your conquered subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that 
is, or ought to be, received among all Christians, of what 
church or pretended church soever, viz,, The Christian 
knowledge ought to be propagated by all possible means, 
and upon all possible occasions. It is on this principle that 
our church sends missionaries into PersiU, India, China ; and 
that our clergy, even of the superior sort, willingly engage 
in the most hazardous voyages, and the most dangerous 
residence among murderers and barbarians, to teach them 
the knowledge of the true God, and to bring them over to 
embrace the Christian faith. Now, sir, you have such an 
opportunity here to have six or seven and thirty poor sav- 
ages brought over from idolatry to the knowledge of God 
their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pasa 
such an occasion of doing good, which is really worth the 
expense of a man's whole life, 

I was now struck dumb, indeed, and had not one word u 
say. I had here a spirit of true Christian zeal for God and 
religion before me, let his particular principles he of what 
kind soever : as for me, I had not so much as entertained a 
)lLought of this in my heart before, and I believe I should

not have thought of it ; for I looked upon these savagts as 
daves, and people whom, had we any work for them to do, 
we would have used as such, or would have been glad to 
Lave transported them to any other part of the world: foi 
our business was to get rid of them ; and we would all have 
been satisfied if they had been sent to any country, so they 
had never seen their own. But to the case ; — I say, I waa 
ronfounded at his discourse, and knew not what answer to 
make him. 

He looked earnestly at me, seeing me in some disorder — 
Sir, says he, I shall be very sorry if what I have said gives 
you any offence. — No, no, said I, I am offended with no- 
body but myself; but I am perfectly confounded, not only 
to think that I should never take any notice of this before, 
but with reflecting what notice I am able to talie of it now. 
You know, sir, said I, what circumstances I am in ; I am 
bound to the East Indies in a ship freighted by merchants, 
and to whom it would be an insufferable piece of injustice 
to detain their ship here, the men lying all this while at 
victuals and wages on the owners* account. It is true, I 
Agreed to be allowed twelve days here, and if I stay more, I 
must pay three pounds sterling per diem demurrage; not 
can I stay upon demurrage above eight days more, and I 
have been here thirteen already ; so that I am perfectly un- 
able to engage in this work, unless I would suffer myself to 
be left behind here again ; in which case, if this single ship 
should miscarry in any part of her voyage, I should be just 
in the same condition that I was left in here, at first, and 
from which I have been so wonderfully delivered. He 
owned the case was very hard upon me, as to my voyage ; 
hut laid it home upon my conscience, whether the blessing 
9f saving thirty-seven souls was not worth venturing all 1 
had in the world for. 1 was not so sensible of that as he 
tvas. I returned upon him thus : Why, sir, it is a valuable 
thing, indeed, to be an instrument in God*s hand *o convcr*

ihirty-seven heathens to the knowledge of i/hrist ; but ai 
you are an ecclesiastic, and are given over to the work, 80 
that it Beenis so naturally to fall into the way of your pro- 
fession, how is it then that you do not rather offer yoursell 
to undertake it, than press me to do it ? 

Upon this he faced about just before me, as he walked 
along, and putting me to a full stop, made me a very low 
bow. I most heartily thank God and you, sir, said he, for 
giving me so evident a call to so blessed a work ; and if you 
think yourself discharged from it, and desire me to under- 
take it, 1 will most readily do it, and think it a happy 
reward for all the hazards and difficulties of such a broken, 
disappointed voyage as I have met with, that I am dropped 
at last into so glorious a work. 

I discoveiM a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke 
this to me ; his eyes sparkled like fire, his face glowed, and 
his color came and went, as if he had been falling into fits ; 
in a word, he was fired with the joy of being embarked in 
such a work. I paused a considerable while before I could 
•^ell what to say to him ; for I was really surprised to find a 
man of such sincerity and zeal, and carried out in his zeal 
beyond the ordinary rate of men, not of his profession only, 
but even of any professsion whatsoever. But after I had 
considered it awhile, I asked him seriously if he was in 
earnest, and that he would venture, on the single considera- 
tion of an attempt on those poor people, to be locked up in 
in unplanted island for perhaps his life, and at last might 
not know whether he should be able to do them good « 
not ? 

He turned short upon me, and asked me what I called a 
?enture? Pray, sir, said he, what do you think I consented 
to go in your ship to the East Indies for ? — Nay, said I, 
that 1 know not, unless it was to preach to the Indians. — 
Doubtless it was, said he ; and do you think, if I can con- 
cert these thir:y-8even men to the faith of Jesus Christ, :t if

Act wottl. my time, though 1 should never be fetched oft ch«

•are so many souls than my life is, or the life of twent) 
more of the same profession ? Yes, sir, says he, I would 
gjLve Christ and the blessed Virgin thanks all my days, if I 
eould be made the least happy instrument of saving the 
tonls of those poor men, though I weie never to set my foot 
off this island, or see my native country any moie. But 
since you will honor me with putting me into this work, fci 
which I will pray for you all the days of my life, I have one 
humble petition to you besides. — What is that? said 1. 
Why, says he, it is, that you will leave your man Friday 
with me, to be my interpreter to them, and to assist me ; 
for without some help I cannot speak to them, or they to 
rae. ,^ 

I was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because 1 
:ould not think of parting with him, and that for many 
reasons : he had been the companion of my travels ; he was 
not only faithful to me, but sincerely affectionate to the last 
degree ; and I had resolved to do something considerable 
for him if he outlived me, as it was probable he would. 
Then I knew that as I had bred Friday up to be a Protestant, 
it would quite confound him to bring him to embrace another 
profession ; and he would never, while his eyes were open, 
believe that his old master was a heretic, and would be 
damned ; and this might, in the end, ruin the poor fellow's 
principles, and so turn him back again to hie first idolatry. 
However, a sudden thought relieved me in this strait, and it 
was this : I told him I could not say that I was willing to 
part with Friday on any account whatever, though a work 
that to him was of more value than his life, ought t ) be o) 
much more value than the keeping or parting with a servant. 
But, on the other hand, I was persuaded that Friday would 
by no means agree to part with me ; and I could not forcf 
aim to it without his consent, without nmnifest injustice;

because I had promised I would never put him away, and 
he had promif^ed and engaged ^to me that he would nevei 
leave me unlebi 1 put him away. 

lie seemed very much concerned at it, for he had na 
rational access to these poor people, seeing he did not 
understand one word of their language, nor they one word 
of his. To remove this difficulty, I told him Friday's fathet 
had learned Spanish, which I found he also understood, and 
he should serve him as an interpreter. So he was much 
better satisfied, and nothing could persuade him but he 
would stay and endeavor to convert them ; but Pro^ndence 
gave another very happy turn to all this. 

I come back now to the first part of his objections. When 
we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them altogether, and 
after some account given them of what I had done for them, 
viz., what necessary things I had provided for them, and 
how they were distributed, which they were very sensible of^ 
and very thankful for, I began to talk to them of the 
very scandalous life they led, and gave them a full account 
of the notice the clergyman had taken of it ; and arguing 
how unchristian and irreligious a life it was, I first asked 
them if they were married men or bachelors ? They soon 
explained their conditions to me, and showed that two oi 
them were widowers, and the other three were single men or 
bachelors. I asked them with what conscience they could 
take those women, and lie with them as they had done, call 
them their wives, and have so many children by them, and 
not be lawfully married to them ? 

They all gave me the answer I expected, viz., that there 
was nobody to marry them ; that they agreed before the 
governor to keep them as their wives, and to maintain them 
and own them as their wives ; and they thought, as things 
stood with them, they were as legally married as if they 
had been married by a parson, and with all the formalitiei 
kn ihe world. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 46J 

1 told thean *hat no doubt they were married in the sigh* 
Bf God, and were bound in conscience to keep them as theii 
wives ; but that the laws of men being otherwise, they 
might desert the poor women and children hereafter ; and 
that their wives being poor desolate wom'^n, friendless and 
moneyless, would have no way to help themselves. I there- 
fore told them that, unless 1 was assured of their honest 
intent, I could do nothing for them, but would take care 
tliat what I did should be for the women and children with- 
out them ; and that, unless they would give me some 
assurances that they would marry the women, I could not 
think it was convenient they should continue together as 
man and wife ; for it was both scandalous to men and offen- 
sive to God, who they could not think would bless them ii 
they went on thus. 

All this went on as I expected ; and they told me, 
especially Will Atkins, who now seemed to speak for the 
test, that they loved their wives as well as if they had been 
bom in their own native country, and would not leave them 
upon any account whatever : and they did verily believe 
their wives were as virtuous and as modest, and did, to tht 
utmost of their skill, as much for them and for their chil- 
dren, as any women could possibly do ; and they would not 
part with them on any account : and Will Atkins, for his 
own particular, added, that if any man would take him 
away, and offer to carry him home to England, and make 
him captain of the best man-of-war in the navy, he would 
not go with him, if he might not carry his wife and children 
with him ; and if there was a clergyman in the ship, he 
would be married to her now with all his heart. ' 

This was just as I would have it : the priest was not wi:h 
me at that moment, but was not far of; so, to trv him 
further, I told him 1 had a clergyman with me, and, if he 
was sincere, I would have him married next morning, and 
bade b m consider of it, and talk with the rest. He said 



164 ADVENT URKS OF 

*8 for himself, he need not consider of it at all, for he iv^ai 
very ready to do it, and was glad I had a zninistcr with n»% 
and he believed they would be all willing also. I then tolct 
bim that my friend, the minister, was a Frenchman, and 
could not speak English, but I would act the clerk between 
them. He never so much as asked me whether he was a 
Papist or Protestant, which was indeed what I was afraid 
of ; so we parted : I went back to my clergyman, and Will 
Atk'jis went in to talk with his companions. I desired the 
French gentleman not to say anything to them till the busi- 
ness was thorough ripe : and I told him what answer the 
men had given me. 

Before I went from their quarter, they all came to me, and 
told me they had been considering what I had said ; that 
they were glad to hear I had a clergyman in my company, 
and they were very willing to give me the satisfaction 1 
desired, and to be formally married as soon as I pleased ; for 
they were far from desiring to part with their wives, and 
that they meant nothing but what was very honest when they 
chose them. So I appointed them to meet me the next 
morning, and, in the mean time, they should let their wives 
know the meaning of the marriage law ; and that it was not 
only to prevent any scandal, but also to oblige them that 
they should not forsake them, whatever might happen. 

The women were easily made sensible of the meaning ol 
the thing, and were very well satisfied with it, as indeed 
they had reason to be : so they failed not to attend altogether 
at my apartment next morning, where I brought out my 
clergyman ; and though he had not on a minister's gown 
kfier the manner of England, or the habit of a priest, afte> 
the manner of France, yet having a black vest, something 
like a cassock, with a sash round it, he did not look very 
unlike a minister ; and as for his language, I was his intc r- 
preter. B«t the seriousness of his behavior to them, a ad 
die SCI uplei he made of marrying the womer Secause the^ 



ROPINSON CRUSOE 4^^ 

were not baptized ^nd professed Christians, gave them an 
exceeding reverence for his person: and there was no need, 
after that, to inquire whether he was a clergyman or not. 
Indeed, I was afraid his scruples would have been carried so 
£eir, as that he would not have married, them at all; nay, 
notwithstanding all I was able to say to him, he resisted me, 
though modestly, yet very steadily : and at last refused abso* 
lutely to marry them, unless he had first talked with th« 
men and the women too ; and though I at first was a little 
backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a good will, 
perceiving the sincerity of his design. 

When he came to them, he let them know that I had 
acquainted him with their circumstances, and with the present 
design ; that he was very willing to perform that part of his 
function, and marry them, as I had desired ; but that, before 
he could do it, he must take the liberty to talk with them. 
ie told ♦hem, that in the sight of all indifferent men, and 
A me sense of the laws of society, they had lived all thip 
while in open fornication ; and that it was true, that nothing 
but the consenting to marry, or effectually separating them 
from one another, could now put an end to it ; but ther* 
was a difficulty in it too, with respect to the laws of Christiar 
matrimony, which he was not fully satisfied about, viz., that 
of marrying one that is a professed Christian to a savage, an 
idolater and a heathen, one that is not baptized ; and yet 
that he did not see that there was time left to endeavor to 
persuade the women to be baptized, or to profess the name 
of Christ, whom they had, he doubted, heard nothing of, 
and without which they could not be baptized. He told 
them he doubted they were but indifferent Christians them- 
selves ; that they had but little knowledge of God or of hit 
ways, and therefore he could not expect that they had said 
much to their wives on that head yet ; but that, unless they 
would promise hira to use their endeavors witliT their wivei 
-o persuade them to become Christiar 8, and would, as weU 



466 ADVENTURES Or 

as tiiey could, instruct them in the knowledge and belief o^ 
God that made them, and to worship Jesus Christ thai 
redeemed them, he could not marry them ; for ke would 
have no hand in joining Christians with savages; nor wat 
it consistent with the principles of the Christian religion, 
and was indeed expressly forbidden in Ood*8 law. 

They heard all this very attentively, and 1 delivered it very 
fidth^ly to them from his mouth, as near his own words a« 
I could ; only sometimes adding something of my own, tc 
convince them how just it was, and how I was of his mind: 
and I always very f*iithfully distinguished between what 1 
said from myself, and what were the clergyman's words 
They told me it was very true what the gentleman said, that 
they were very indifferent Christians themselves, and that they 
had never talked to their wives about religion. Lord, sir, 
says Will Atkins, how should we teach them religion? why, 
we know nothing ourselves ; and besides, sir, said he, soould 
we talk to them of God and Jesus Christ, and heaven and 
hell, it would make them laugh at us, and ask us what we 
believe ourselves. And if we should tell them that we 
believe all the things we speak of to them, such as of good 
people going to heaven, and wicked people to the devil, they 
would ask us where we intend to go ourselves, that believe 
all this, and are such wicked fellows as we indeed are. Why, 
sir, 'tis enough to give them a surfeit of religion at first 
hearing ; folks must have some religion themselves before 
they pretend to teach other people. — Will Atkins, said I to 
him, though I am afraid that what you say has too much 
truth in it, yet can you not tell your wife that she is in the 
wrong ; that there is a God, and a religion better than her 
own; that her gods are idols; that they can neither hear 
nor speak : that there is a great Being that made all things, 
and that can destroy all that he has made ; that he rewards 
&e good and punishes the bad; and that we are to be 
indeed %^ him at last for all we do here ? You are not m 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 4^1 

Ignorant but evf.n nature itself will tenjuch you that, all thii 
18 true ; and I am satisfied you know it all to be true, and 
oelieve it yourself. — That is true, sir, said Atkins ; but with 
what face can i say anything to my wife of all this, when she 
will tell me immediately it cannot be true ? — Not true ! said 
I ; what do you mean by that ? — Why, sir, said he, she 
will tell me it cannot be true that this Ood I shall tell hei 
of can be just, or can punish or reward, since I am not 
punished and sent to the devil, that have been such a 
i^icked creature as she knows I have been, even to her, and 
to every body else ; and that I should be suffered to live, 
that have been always acting so contrary to what I must tel) 
her is good, and to what I ought to have done. — \Vhy, 
truly, Atkins, said I, I am afraid thou speakest too much 
truth; and with that I informed the clergymen of what 
Atkins had said, for he was impatient to know. O, said the 
priest, tell him there is one thing will make him the best 
minister in the world to his wife, and that is, repentance, 
for none teach repentance like true penitents. He wants 
nothing but to repent, and then he will be so much the bet- 
ter qualified to instruct his wife ; he will then be able to teU 
her that there is not only a God, and that he is the just re- 
warder of good and evil, but that he is a merciful Being, and 
with infinite goodness and long-suffering forbears to punish 
those that offend ; waiting to be gracious, and willing not 
the death of a sinner, but rather that he should return and 
live : that oftentimes he suffers wicked men to go a long 
time, and even reserves damnation to the general day ol 
retribution : that it is a clear evidence of God and of a fu- 
ture state, that right sous men receive not their reward, 01 
wicked men their punishment, till they come into anoth^i 
world ; and this will le?d him to teach his wife the doctrnt 
-^f the resurrection and of the last judgment. Let him but 
•epent for himself, he- will be an excellent preacher of X9 
Deqta^re tp his wif<^. 



«6S ADVENTUKKS OF 

I npeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious aL 
the while, and who, we could easily perceive, was more tlian 
ordinarily affected with it : when, being eager, and hardly 
luffering me to make an end — 1 know all this master, says 
he, and a great deal more ; but I have not the impudence to 
talk thus to my wife, when God and my conscience know, 
iind my wife will be an undeniable evidence against me, thai 
I have lived as if I had never heard of a God or a future 
ftate, or anything about it ; and to talk of my repenting, 
alas ! (and with that he fetched a deep sigh, and 1 could see 
that the tears stood in his eyes) *tis past all that with me 
Past it, Atkins ? said I ; what dost thou mean by that } — 
I know well enough what I mean, says he ; I mean 'tis too 
late, and that is too true. 

I told the clergyman, word for word, what he said : the 
poor zealous priest, — I must call him so, for, be his opinion 
what it will, he had certainly a most singular affection for 
the good of other men's souls, and it would be hard to think 
he had not the like for his own ? — I say, this affectionate 
man could not refrain from tears ; but, recovering himself, 
said to me. Ask him but one question : Is he easy that it is 
too late ; or is he troubled, and wishes it were not so ? I 
put the question fairly to Atkins ; and he answered, with a 
great deal of passion, How could any man be easy in a 
condition that must certainly end in eternal destruction ? 
that he was far from being easy ; but that, on the contrary, 
he believed it would, one time or other, ruin him. What do 
you mean by that? said I, Why, he said, he believed he 
fhould one time or other cut his throat, to put an end to the 
terrw of it. 

1 he clergyman shook his head with great concern in his 
face, when I told him all this; but turning quick to me 
upon it, says, If that be his case, we may assure him it is 
no^ too late ; Christ will give him repentance. But pray, 
lays he, explain this to him ; that as no man is sa^ed but

by Chiist, and the merit of his passion procuring divine 
mercy for l#m, how can it be too late for any man to receive 
mercy ? Does he think he is able to sin beyond the power or 
reach of divine mei ry ? Pray tell him, there may be a time 
when provoked mercy will no longer strive, and when God 
may refuse to hear, but that it is never too late for men to 
ask mercy; and we, that are Christ's servants, are com- 
manded to preach mercy at all times, in the name of Jesus 
Christ, to all those that sincerely repent : so that it is nevei 
^00 late to repent. 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earnest- 
ness ; but it seemed as if he turned off the discourse to the 
rest, for he said to me, he would go and have some talk with 
his wife ; so he went out awhile, and we talked to the rest. 
I perceived they were all stupidly ignorant as to matters oi 
religion, as much as I was when 1 went rambling away from 
my father ; and yet there were none of them backward to 
hear what had been said : and all (»f them seriously promised 
that they would talk with their wives about it, and do theb 
indeavors to persuade them to turn Christians. 

The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported what 
answer they gave, but said nothing a good while ; but at 
last, shaking his head. We that are Christ's servants, says 
he, can go no farther than to exhort and instruct ; ana when 
men comply, submit to the reproof, and promise wnat we 
ask, *tr8 all we can do ; we are bound to accept their good 
words ; but, believe me, sir, said he, whatever you may have 
known of the life of that man you call Will Atkins, I believe 
he is the only sincere convert among them : I take that man 
to be a true penitent : I will not despair of the rest ; but 
that man is apparently struck with the sense of his past ]ife, 
and 1 doubt not, when he comes to talk of religion to hia 
wife, he will talk himself effectually into it ; for attempting 
to teach others is some times the best way of teaching our- 
■e^ves. I know a man, who, having nothing but a summary 
40 • 



170 ADVKNTUKES OF 

notioi of religion himself, and being wicked and prodigiiti 
tu ihe last degree in his life, made a thorough reformation m 
himseJ* by laboring to convert a Jew. If that poor Atkin* 
begins but once to talk seriously of Jesils Christ to his wife, 
my life for it, he talks himself into a thorough convert, 
makes himself a penitent ; and who knows what nu/y 
follow ? 

Upon this discourse, however, and their promising, afe 
above, to endeavor to persuade their wives to embrace 
Christianity, he married the other two couple ; but Will 
Atkins and his wife were not yet come in. After this, my 
clergyman waiting awhile, was curious to know where 
Atkins was gone : and turning to me, said, I entreat you, 
sir, let us walk out of your labyrinth here, and look ; 1 dare 
say we shall find this poor man somewhere or other talking 
seriously to his wife, mnd teaching her already something ot 
religion. I began to be of the same mind ; so we went out 
together, and I carried him a way which none knew but my- 
self, and where the trees were so very thick that it was not 
easy to see through the thicket of leaves, and far harder to 
see in than to see out ; when coming to the edge of the 
wood, I saw Atkins and his tawny wife sitting under the 
shade of a bush, very eager in discourse : I stopped short 
till my clergyman came up to me, and then having showed 
him where they were, we stood and looked very steadily at 
them a good while. We observed him very earnest with 
her, pointing up to the sun, and to every quarter of the 
neavens, and then down to the earth, then out to the sen, 
then to himself, then to her, to the woods, to the trees. 
Now, says the clergyman, you see my words are made good, 
the. man preaches to her ; mark him now, he is telling hei 
that our God has made him and her, and the heavens, the 
f arth, the sea, the woods, the trees, &c. — I believe he is, 
laid I. Immeliately we perceived Will Atkins start upor 
nis fe t M\ dr wn on his knees, and lift up both his hands 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 47] 

We supposed he said something, but we eould not hear hj^\i 
it was too far for that. He did not continue kneeling half 8 
minute, but comes and sits down by his wife, and talks to 
Let again ; we perceived then the woman very attentive, but 
whether she said anything to him, we could not tell. While 
the poor fellow was upon his knees, 1 could see the tears run 
plentifully down my clergyman's cheeks, and I could haidly 
forbear myself; but it was a great affliction to us both that 
we were not near enough to hear anything that passed 
between them. Well, however, we could come no nearer, 
for fear of disturbing them ; so we resolved to see an end to 
this piece of still conversation, and it spoke loud enough to 
us without the help of voice. He sat down again, as I have 
said close by her, and talked again earnestly to her, and 
two or three times we could see him embrace her most pas- 
sionately ; another time we saw him take out his handker- 
chief and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her again, with a 
kind of transport very unusual ; and after several of these 
things, we saw him on a sudden jump up again, and lend 
her his hand to help her up, when immediately leading 
her by the hand a step or two, they both kneeled down 
together, and continued so about two minutes. 

My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud, St. 
Paul ! St. Paul ! behold he prayeth. 1 was afraid Atkins 
would hear him, therefore I entreated him to withhold him- 
self awhile, that we might see an end of the scene, which 
to me, I must confess, was the most affecting that ever I 
laW in my life. Well, he strove with himself for a while, 
5ut was in such raptures to think that the poor heathen 
iv^oman was become a Christian, that he was not able to con- 
tain himself; he wept several times, then throwing up his 
hands and crossing his breast, said over several things ejacu- 
*Atory, and by way of giving God thanks for so miraculous 
t, testimony of the si-ccess of our endea^'ors ; some he spoke 
lofUy, and I could nt t well hear others ; some in Latin, semi

in French ; then two or three times the tears would intemipl 
him, that he could not speak at ail ; but 1 begged that he 
would contain himself, and let us more narrowly and fully 
observe what was before us, which he did for a time, the 
scene not being near ended yet ; for after the poor man and 
his wife were risen again from their knees, we observed he 
stood talking still eagerly to her, and ve observed h(r 
motion, that she was greatly affected with what ho said, by 
her frequently lifting up her hands, laying her hand to hir 
breast, and such other postures as express the greatest seri- 
ousness and attention : thb continued about half a quarter 
of an hour, and then they walked away ; so we could see no 
more of them in that situation. I took this interval to talk 
with my clergyman ; and first, I was glad to see the partic- 
ulars we had both been witnesses to, that, though I was Lard 
enough of belief in such cases, yet that I began to think it 
was all very sincere here, both in the man and hie wife, 
however ignorant they might both be, and I hoped such a 
beginning would yet have a more happy end : And who 
knows, said I, but these two may in time, by instruction ana 
example, work upon some of the others? — Some of them? 
said he, turning quick upon me ; ay, upon all of them • 
depend upon it, if those two savages, for he has been but 
little better, as you relate it, should embrace Jesus Christ, 
they will never leave it till they work upon all the rest ; foi 
true religion is naturally communicative, and he that is once 
made a Christian will nc% er leave a pagan behind him, if he 
can help it. I owned it was a most Christian principle to 
think so, and a testimony of true zeal, as well as a generous 
hearty in him. But, my firiend, said I, will you give me 
leave to start one difficulty here ? I cannot tell how to object 
the least thing against that affectionate concern which you 
show for the turning the poor people from their paganism tc 
the Christian religion : but how does this comfort you whUe 
these people are, ii y ""r a'^count, out of the pale of tb« Cath;

»lid cburch, without which you believe there is no sulvution ? 
10 that you esteem these but heretics, and for other reasoni 
AS effectually lost as the pagan« themselve s. 

To this he answered, with abundance of candor, thus : 
Sir, I am a Catholic of the Roman church, and a priest ol 
the order of St. Benedict, and I embrace all the prine pies 
of the Roman faith ; but yet, if you will believe me, and 
that I do not speak in compliment to you, or in respect : D 
my circumstances and your civilities; I say, nevertheless, L 
do not look upon you who call yourselves reformed, without 
some charity: I dare not say (though I know it is our 
opinion in general) that you cannot be saved ; I will by no 
means limit the mercy of Christ so flir as to think that ho 
cannot receive you into the bosom of his church, in a man 
ner to us unperceivable ; and I hope you have the same 
charity for us ; I pray daily for your being all restored to 
Christ's church, by whatsoever method he, who is all-wise. 
Is pleased to direct. In the mean time, sure you will allow 
it consists with me, as a Roman, to distinguish far between 
a Protestant and a pagan ; between one that calls on Jcs)is 
Christ, though in a way which I do not think is according tc 
the true faith, and a savage or a barbarian, that knows no 
God, no Christ, no Redeemer ; and if you are not within the 
pale of the Catholic church, we hope you are nearer being 
restored to it than those who know nothing of God or of his 
church : and I rejoice, therefore, when I see this poor man, 
who, you say, has been a profligate, and almost a murderer, 
kneel down and pray to Jesus Christ, as we suppose he did, 
tliough not fully enlightened ; believing that God, from 
whom every such work ipoceeds, will sensibly tocb hii» 
heart, and bi'ng him to the further knowledge of that truth 
in his own time : and if God shall influence this poor man 
to convert and instruct the ignorant savage, his wife, I can

I WAS astonished at the sincerity and temper of this pious 
papist, as much as I was oppressed by the power of his 
reasoning ; and it presently occurred to my thoughts, that if 
Buch a temper was universal, we might all be Catholic Chris- 
tians, whatever church or particular profession we joined in ; 
that a spirit of charity would soon work us all up into right 
principles ; and as he thought that the like charity would 
rnako us all Catholics, so I told^im I believed had all the 
Encinbcrs of his church the like moderation, thoy would soou 
all be Protestants. — And there we left that part ; for we 
never disputed at aL 

Howe-^er, I talked 'o him another way, and taking him by 
tlie hac r My fric nd says I, I wish all the clergy of tht 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 474 

R. niish church were blest with such moderation, and had an 
equal share of your charity. I am entirely of your opinion , 
hut 1 must tell you, that if you should preach such doctrine 
in Spain or Italy, they would put you into the Inquisition.— 
It may be so, said he ; I know not what they would do ia 
^pain or Italy ; but I will not say they would be the bettci 
Cnristians for that severity ; for 1 am sure there is no henisj 
in abounding with oharity. 

As Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our business there 
was over, so we went back our own way ; and m hen we 
came back, we found them waiting to be called in : observ- 
ing this, I asked my clergyman if we should discover to him 
that we had seen him under the bush or not ; and it was his 
opinion we should not, but that we should talk to him first, 
and hear what he would say to us ; so we called him in 
alone, nobody being in the place but ourselves, and I began 
with him thus : 

Will Atkins, said I, prithee what education had you? 
Wnat was your father ? 

W. A. A better man than ever I shall be : Sir, my father 
was a clergyman. 

R. C. What education did he give you ? 

W. A. He would have taught me well, sir ; but I des* 
pised all education, instruction or correction, like a beast ai 
I was. 

K. C. It is true, Solomon says. He that despises reproof Lf 
brutbh. 

W. A. Ay, sir, I was brutish indeed, for I murdered n.y 
father : for God's sake, sir, talk no more about that ; sir, I 
murdered my poor father. ^ 

Pk. Ha ! a murderer ! 

Here the priest started (for I interpreted every word as hs 
l^ke) and looked pale : it seems he believed that Will had 
•ally killed his father. 

Q. C. Nc, no, sir, I J > not understand him so : Will 



iff ADVENTURES OF 

A^tsins, explain yourself; you did not kill your father, did 
you, with your own hands ? 

W. A. No, sir, 1 did not cut his throat ; but I cut the 
thread of all his comforts, and shortened his days : I broke 
his heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural return, for the 
most tender and affectionate treatment that father ever gave, 
or child could receive. 

R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your father, to extort 
tnis confession : I pray God give you repentance for it, and 
forgive that and all your other sins ; but I asked you because 
1 see that though you have not much learning, yet you are 
not so ignorant as some are in things that are good : that 
you have known more of religion, a great deal, than you 
have practised. 

W. A. Though you, sir, did not extort the confession that 
I make about my father, conscience does ; and whenever we 
come to look back upon our lives, the sins against our in- 
dulgent parents are certainly the first that touch us; the 
wounds they make lie deepest, and the weight they leave 
will lie heaviest upon the mind, of all the sins we can com- 
mit. 

R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins ; 
I cannot bear it. 

W. A. You bear it, master ! I dare say you know nothing 
of it. 

R. C. Yes, Atkins ; every shore, every hill, ns % I may 
say every tree in this island, is witness to the angiush of my 
soul for my ingratitude and bad usage of a good, tendei 
father ; a father much like yours, by your description : and 
I murdered my father as well as you. Will Atkins ; but I 
think, for all that, my repentance is short of yours too, by a 
(preat deal. 

I would have said more, if I could have restrained mj 
passions ; but 1 thought this poor man's repentance was so 
muoh sir "»e'er 6 an mine, that I was going to leave off t^e 



.BINSON UKUSOE. 477 

diBCOuTde and retire ; for I was surprised with ^ ^at he had 
said, and thought that instead of my going abcnt to teacb 
and instruct him this man was made a teacher and instructoi 
to me in a most surprising and unexpected manner. 

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who wat 
ereatly affected with it, and said to me. Did I not say, sir, 
that when this man was converted he would preach to us 
all ? I tell you, sir, if this one man be made a true peni- 
tent, here will be no need of me ; he will make Christiana 
of all in the island. — But having a little composed myself, 
I renewed my discourse with Will Atkins. But, Will, said 
L how comes the sense of this matter to touch you just 
now ? 

W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck 
a dart through my very soul ; I have been talking about 
God and religion to my wife, in order, as • you directed me, 
"1 make a Christian of her, and she has preached such a 
sermon to me as I shall never forget while I live. 

R. C. No, no, it is not your wife has preached to you ; 
out when you were moving religious arguments to her, con- 
Hcience has flung them back upon you. 

W. A. Ay, sir, with such force as is not to be resisted. 

R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed between you 
djid your wife ; for I know something of it already. 

W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full account ol 
it ; I am too full to hold it, and yet have no tongue to ex- 
Dress it ; but let her have said what she will, and though I 
cannot give you an account of it, this 1 can tell you, that I 
have resolved to amend and reform my life. 

R. C. But tell us some of it : how did you begin. Will ' 
For this has been an extraordinary case, that is certain 
She has preached a sermon, indeed, if sb** has wrought thi»

W. A. Why, I first told her the nature of our laws about 
narriHge, and what the reasons were that men and womeo 



178 \DVEN1CJRES or 

were obliged to enter into such compacts, as i. ms DeitLet 
in the |)ower of one nor other to break ; th&. other^^dse 
order and justice could nof be maintained, and men would 
run fW>m their wives, and abandon their children, mix con- 
fusedly with one another, and neither families be kept entire, 
Qor inheritances be settled by legal descent. 

R. C. You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you make 
b3r understand what you meant by inheritance and families ? 
Ibey know no such things among the savages, but marry 
any how, without regard to relation, consanguinity, or fam- 
Jy ; brother and sister, nay, as I have been told, even the 
father and the daughter, and the son and the mother. 

W. A. I believe, sir, you are misinformed, and my wife 
tissures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it ; perhaps, 
for any farther relations, they may not be so exact as we 
are ; but she tells me they never touch one another in the 
near relationship you speak of. 

R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told her ? ~ 

W. A. She said she liked it very well, and it was much 
better than in her country. 

R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was ? 

W. A. Ay, ay ; there began our dialogue. I asked her 
if she would be married to me our way. She asked me 
what way that was. I told her marriage was appointed by 
Ood ; and here we had a strange talk together, indeed, ij^ 
ever man and wife had, I believe. 

JV. J5. This dialogue between Will Atkins and his wife ^ 
took down in writing, just after he had told it me, whicn 
% as as follows : 

WiFB. Appointed by God! Why, have you a God iu 
»3iir country ? 

W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in erery country. 

Wife. No your God in my country ; my courtry havi 
>b* great old Benamuckee God. 

W. A. Child, I am very unfit to show you who God it

God is in heaven, and made the heaven and the ear.L. ch« 
tea, and all that in them is. 

Wife. No makee de earth ; no you God makee all eftxth . 
no makee my country. 

Will Atkins laughed a little at her expression of God not 
making her country. 

Wife. No laugh; why laugh me? This nothing to 
laugh. 

He was justly reproved by his wife, for she was mora 
serious than he at first. 

W. A. That's true indeed ; I will not laugh any more, my 
dear. 

Wife. Why you say you God makee all ? 

W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole world, and 
you and me, and all things ; for he is the only true God« 
and there is no God but him ; he lives for ever in heaven 

Wife. Why you no tell me long ago ? 

W. A. That's true indeed ; but 1 have been a wicked 
wretch, and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with 
any thing before, but have lived without God in the world 
myself. 

Wi fe. What have you a great God in your country, you 
no know him ? No say O to him ? No do good thing for 
nim ? That no possible. 

W. A. It is true ; though, for all that, we live as if theie 
was no God in heaven, or that he had no power on earth. 

Wife. But why God let you do so ? Why he no makee 
f ou good live ? 

W. A. It is all our own fault. 

Wife. But you say me he is g/eat, much great, have 
much great power, can makee kill when he will, why he no 
makee kill when you no serve him, no say O to him, no be 
grod mans ?

true ; bdt Ood is merciful, and does not deal with us as %ic 
deserve. 

Wife. But then do you not tell God thankee for that 
too.> 

\V. A. No, indeed, I have not thanked God for his mcisji 
any more than I have feared God for his power. 

Wife. Then you God no God ; me no think believe he 
be such one, great much power, strong : no makee kill you 
though you make him so much angry, 

W. A^ What, will my ^vicked life hinder you from believ- 
ing in God ? What a dreadful creature am I ! and what a 
sad truth it is, that the horrid lives of Christians hinder the 
conversion of licathens ! 

WiFK. How me think you have great <nuch God up there 
(she points up to heaven) and yet no do well, no do good 
thing ? Can he tell ? Sure he no tell what you do ? 

W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and sees all things ; he hears 
us speak, sees what we do, knows what we think, though we 
do not speak. 

Wife. What! he no hear you curse, swear, speak de 
great damn ? 

W. A. Yes, yes, hears it all. 

Wi FB. Where be then the much great power strong ? 

W. A. He is merciful, that is all we can say for it ; and 
this proves him to be the true God ; he is God, and not 
man, and therefore we are not consumed. 

Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with horror, to 
think how he could tell his wife so clearly that God sees, 
\i d hears, and knows the secret thoughts of the heart, and 
ill that we do, and yet that he had dared to do aU the vile 
things he had done. 

Wife. Merciful ! What you call that ? 

W. A. He is our father and maker, and he pities ao^ 
»p%re8 OS. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 48* 

Wife. So then he never makee kill, never angrj when 
you do wicked ; then he no good himself, or no great able. 

W. A. Yes, yes, my dear, he is infinitely good and in- 
finitely great, and able to punish too ; and sometimes, to 
show his justice and vengeance, he lets fly his anj^ei te 
destroy sinners and make examples ; many are cut off in 
their sins. 

Wife. But no makee kill you yet ; then he tell you, may 
be, that he no makee you kill : so you makee de bargain 
with him, you do bad thing, he no be angry at you when he 
be angry at other mans. 

W. A. No, indeed ; my sins are all presumptions upon 
his goodness ; and he would be infinitely just if he destroyed 
me, as he has done other men. 

Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead ; what 
you say to him for that ? You no tell him thankee for all 
that too? 

W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that is true. 

Wife, Why he no makee you much good better? you 
say he makee you. 

W. A. He made me, as he made all the world : it is 1 
ha^e deformed myself and abused his goodness, and made 
myp«lf an abominable wretch. 

Wife. I wish you makee God know me ; I no makee him 
angry, I no do bad wicked thing. 

Here Will Atkins said his heart sunfc within him, to hear 
A poor untaught creature desire to be taught to know God, 
and he such a wicked wretch that he could not say one word 
tj hsr about God, but what the reproach of his own car- 
riage would make most irrational to her to believe ; nay, 
that already she had told him that she could not believe 
in God, because he, that was so wicked, was not de- 
stroyed.

W. A. Poor creature, he must teach thee, I cannot t^^acb 
thee ; I will pray to him to teach thee to know him, and for* 
pve me, that am unworthy to teach thee. 

The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring him 
to make her know God, and her wishing to know him, that 
he said he fell down on his krees before her, and prayed to 
God to enlighten her mind - .th the saving knowledge of 
Jesus Christ, and to pardon his sins, and accept of his being 
the unworthy instrument of in8tructing"her in the principles 
of religion ; after which he sat down by her again, and their 
disdogue went on. — This was the time when we saw him 
kneel down, and hold up his hands. 

Wife. What you put down the knee for?* What you 
hold up the hand for ? What you say ? Who you speak 
to? What is all that? 

W. A. My dear, I bow my knees in token of my submis- 
•ion to him that made me ; I said O to him, as you call it; 
and as yout old men do to their idol Benamuckee ; that is, 1 
prayed to him. 

Wi FE. What you say O to him for ? 

W. A. I prayed to him to open your eyes, and your un- 
derstanding, that you may know him, and be accepted by 
him. 

Wi FE. Can he do that too? 

W* A. Yes, he can ; he can do all things. 

Wife. But now he hear what you say ? 

W. A. Yes ; he has bid us pray to him, and promised tc 
bear us. 

WiFK. Bidyou^ray? When he bid you ? Flow he bid 
fou ? What, you h«*ar him speak ? 



KOBINSON CRUSOB 49^ 

"W A. No, we do not hear him speaK; bu he nan 
fcvealed himself many ways to us. 

Here he was at a great loss to make her understand that 
God has revealed himself to us by his word, and what hii 
word was ; but at last he told it her thus : 

W. A. God has spoken to some good men in former days, 
oven from heaven, by plain words ; and God has inspired 
good men by his Spirit ; and they have written all his laws 
down in a book. 

WiFK. Me no understand that ; where is my book ? 

W. A. Alas ! my poor creature, I have not this book ; 
but I hope I shall one time or other get it for you, and help 
you tc read it. 

Here he embraced her with great affection ; but with inex- 
pressible grief that he had not a Bible. 

Wife. But how you makee me know that God teachee 
them to write that book ? 

W. A. By the same rule that we know him to be God. 

Wife. What rule ! AVh.it way you know him ? 

W. A. Because he teaches and commands nothing but 
what is good, righteous, and holy, and tends to make us per 
fectly good, as well as perfectly happy ; and because he for- 
bids, and commands us to avoid, all that is wicked, that ih 
evil in itself, or evil in its consequence. 

Wife. That me would understand, that me fain see *, 
if he teachee all good thing, he makee all good thing, he 
give all thing, he hear me when I say O to him, as you do 
just now; he makee me good, if I wish to be good; he 
spare me, no makee kill me, when I no be good : all thij 
you say he do, yet he be great God : me take, think, believe 
him to be great God ; me say O to him with you, my dear. 

Here the poor man could forbear no longer, but raised her 
np, made her kneel by him, and he prayed to God aloud to 
Instruct her in the koowlege of himself, by his Spirit ; and 
that by some good providence, if possible, she might somt 



484 ADVENTURES OF 

dmA or other come to have a Bible that she might read the 
woid of God, and be taught by it to know him — This wai 
the time that we saw him lift her up by the hand, and saw 
him kneel down by her, as above. 

They had several other discourses, it seems, after this, too 
long to be set down here ; and particularly she made him 
promise, that since he confessed his own life Lad been a 
wicked abominable course of provocations against God, that 
he would reform it, and not make God angry any more ; lest 
he should make him dead, as he called it, and then she would 
be left alone, and never be taught to know this God better ; 
and lest he should be miserable, as he hud told her wicked 
men would be, after death. 

This was a strange account, and very afTectin;^ to us both, 
but particularly to the young clergyman ; he was indeed 
wonderfully surprised with it, but under the greatest afflic- 
tion imaginable that he could not talk to her, that he could 
not speak English, to make her understand him ; and as she 
spoke but very broken English, he could not understand her ; 
however, he turned himself to me, and told me that he 
believed that there must be more to do with this woman 
than to marry her. I did not understand him at first, but 
at length he explained himself, viz., that she ought to be 
baptized. I agreed with him in that part readily, and was 
for going about it presently. No, no; hold, sir, said he; 
though I would have her be baptized by all means, yet 1 must, 
observe that Will Atkins, her husband, has indeed brought 
her, in a wonderful manner, to be willing to embrace a 
religious life, and has given her just ideas of the being 
of a God; of his power, justice, and mercy: yet 1 desire to 
know of him if he has said anything to her of Jesus Christ, 
and of the salvation of sinners ; of the nature of faith in 
aim, and redemption by him ; of the Holy Spirit, the lesur- 
rection, the last judgment, and a future state. 

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him ; bu^ tks poo« 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 489 

fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us he had said 
•omething to her of all those things, but that he was him^ 
self so wicked a creature, and his conscience so reproached 
him with his horrid ungodly life, that he trembled at the 
apprehensions that her knowlege of him should lessen the 
attention she should give tp those things, and mal^e hei 
rather contemn religion than receive it ; but he was assuied, 
he said, that her mind was so disposed to receive due im« 
pressions of all those things, and that if I would but dis- 
course with her, she would make it appear to my satisfaction 
that my labor would not be lost upon her. 

Accordingly, I called her in, and placing myself as inters 
preter between my religious priest and the woman, 1 
entreated him to begin with her ; but sure such a sermon 
was never preached by a popish priest in these latter ageo ol 
the world : and as I told him, I thought he had all the zeal, 
Ul the knowledge, all the sincerity of a Christian, without 
the error of a Roman Catholic ; and that I took him to be 
such a clergyman as the Roman bishops were, before the 
church of Rome assumed spiritual sovereignty over the con- 
sciences of men. In a word, he brought the poor woman to 
embrace the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption by him, 
not with wonder and astonishment only, as she did the first 
notions of a Ood, but with joy and faith ; with an affection, 
and a surprising degree of understanding, scarce to be 
imagined, much less to be expressed; and, at her own 
request, she was baptized. 

WTien he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated him 
that he would perform that office with some caution, that the 
man might not perceive he was of the Roman church, if pos- 
sible, because of other ill consequences which might attend 
a difference among us in that very religion which we wert 
Instructing the other in. He told me that as he had no con* 
^ecrated chapel, nor proper things for the office, I should see 
i3 wi'dd do it in a manner that I should not know by it 
41*

that he wai a Roman Catholic himself, if I had not knowi 
It before ; and so he did ; for saying only some words ovei 
to himself in Latin, which I could not understand, he poured 
a whole dishful of water upon the woman's head, pronouncing 
in French very loud, "Mary," (which was the name her 
husband desired me to give her, for I was her godfather,) ** 1 
baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and 
of the Holy Ohost : " so that none could know anything by 
it what religion he was of. He gave the benediction after- 
wards in Latin, but either Will Atkins did not know but it 
was French, or else did not take notice of it at that time. 

As soon as this was over, we married them ; and after the 
marriage was over, he turned to Will Atkins, and in a very 
affectionate manner exhorted him, not only to persevere in 
that good disposition he was in, but to support the convic- 
tions that were upon him by a resolution to reform his life ; told 
him it was in vain to say he repented if he did not forsake his 
mmes : represented to him how God had honored him with 
'.leing the instrument of bringing his wife to the knowledge 
cf the Christian religion, and that he should be careful he 
did not dishonor the grace of God ; and that if he did, he 
would see the heathen a better Christian than himself; the 
savage converted, and the instrument cast away. He said a 
great many good things to them both ; and then recommend- 
ing them to God's goodness, gave them the benediction 
again, I repeating everything to them in English ; and thus 
ended the ceremony. I think it was the most pleasant and 
agreeable day to me that ever I passed in my whole life. 

But my clergyman had not done yet ; his thoughts hung 
continually upon the conversion of the thirty-seven savages 
and fain he would have stayed upon the island to have under 
taken it ; but I convinrsd him, first, that his undertaking was 
impracticable in itself; and, secondly, that perhaps I would 
out it into a way of being done in his absence to his sati* 
bction ; of which by and by. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 437 

Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a curov 
compass, I was preparing to go on board the ship, when thf 
foung man I had taken out of the famished ship's company 
«ame to me, and told me he understood I had a clergyman 
(vith me, and 'iiat I had caused the Englishmen to be 
married to the savages ; that he had a match, too, which he 
desired might be finished before I went, between two Chi is- 
tians, which he hoped would not be disagreeable to me. 

I knew this must be the young woman who was his 
mothers*8 servant, for there was no other Christian woman 
on the island ; so I began to persuade him not to do any- 
thing of that kind rashly, or because he found himself in. 
this solitary circumstance. I represented to him that he had 
Bome considerable substance in the world, and good friends, 
as I understood by himself, and the maid also ; that the 
maid was not only poor, and a servant, but was unequal to 
him, she being six or seven-and-twenty years old, and he 
not being seventeen or eighteen; that he might very 
probably, with my assistance, make a remove from this wil- 
derness, and come into his own country again ; and that 
then it would be a thousand to one but he would repent his 
choice, and the dislike of that circumstance might be disad- 
vantageous to both. I was going to say more, but he inter- 
rupted me, smiling, and told me, with a great deal of mod- 
esty, that I mistook in my guesses, that he had nothing of 
that kind in his thoughts ; and he was very glad to hoar 
that I had an intent of putting them in a way to see thcL* 
own country again ; and nothing should have put him upon 
staying there, but that the voyage I was going was so ex- 
ceeding long and hazardous, and would carry him quite out 
df the reach of all his friends ; that he had nothing to 
lidsire :f me, but that I would settle him in some little piop- 
erty in the island where he was, give him a servant or two, 
tnd ^ome few necessaries, and he *vould settle himself here 
3Ve 21 planter, waiting the good time when, if ever I »o

^imed to England, I would redeem them ; and hoped I 
^ould no J be unmindful of him when I came to England; 
that he w^uld give me some letters to his friends in London, 
to let them know how good I had been to him, and in what 
part of the world, and what circumstances I hud left him in; 
and he promised me that whenever I redeemed him, the 
plantation, and all improvements^lie had made upon it, let 
the value be what it would, should be wholly mine. 

His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering hii 
jrouth, and was the more agreeable to me, because he told 
me positively the match was not for himself. I gave him all 
possible assurances that if I lived to come safe to England, I 
would deliver his letters, and do his business effectually ; 
and that he might depend I should never forget the circum- 
itances I had left him in : but still I was impatient to know 
who was the person to be married : upon which he told me 
it was my Jack-of-all-trades and his maid Susan. I was 
most agreeably surprised when he named the match ; for 
indeed I thought it very suitable. The character ol 
Uiat man I have given already ; and as for the maid, she 
was a very honest, modest, sober, and religious young 
woman ; had a very good share of sense, was agreeable 
enough in her person, spoke very handsomely, and to the 
purpose, always with decency and good manners, and neither 
too backward to speak, when requisite, nor impertinently 
forward, when it was not her business : very handy and 
housewifely, and an excellent manager ; fit, indeed, to have 
been governess to the whole island, and she knew very 
well how to behave in every respect. 

The match being proposed in this manner, we married 
them the same day ; and as I was father at the altar, as 1 
may say, and gave her away, so I gave her a portion ; for I 
appointed her and her husband a handsome large space o( 
ground for their plantation ; and, indeed, this ma^ch, a^d 



ROBINSON CRUSOH. 4g^ 

die proposal tbi young gentleman made to g ve hiji a email 
property in the island, put me upon parcelling it cut 
amongst them, that they might not quarrel afterwards about 
their situation. 

This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins, 
who was now grown a sober, grave, managing fellow, per- 
fectly reformed, exceedingly pious and religious, and as far 
as I may be allowed to speak positively in such a case, I 
verily believe he is a true penitent. He divided things so 
justly, and so mucn to every one*s satisfaction, that they 
only desired one general writing under my hand for the 
whole, which I caused to be drawn up, and signed and 
sealed to them, setting out the bounds and situation of 
every man's plantation, and testifying that I gave them 
thereby severally a right to the whole possession and 
inheritance of the respective plantations or farms, mth their 
improvements, to them and their heirs, reserving all the rest 
of the island as my own property, and a certain rent for 
every particular plantation after eleven years, if 1, or any 
one from me, or in my name, came to demand it, producing 
an attested copy of the same writing. 

As to the government and laws among them, I told them J 
was not capable of giving them better rules than they were 
able to give themselves ; only I made them promise me to 
live in love and good neighborhood with one another ; and 
so I prepared to leave them. 

One thing I must not omit, and that is, that being now 
settled in a kind of commonwealth among themselves^ and 
having much business in hand, it was but odd to have seven- 
and-thirty Indians live in a nook of the island, independent, 
and, indeed, unemployed ; for, excepting the providing them- 
lelves food, which they had difficulty enough tQ do some* 
times, they had no manner of business or property tc 
manage. I proposed, therefore, to the governor Spaniari

greater extent than ever she imagined, for they were reser^ t4 
for the comfoi* and instruction of those that made much 
better use of them than I had done. 

■ I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I came 
to Will Atkins's tent, or house, and found the young woman 
and Atkins's baptized wife had been discoursing of religion 
together, for Will Atkins told it me with a great deal of joy, 
1 asked if they were together now, and he said yes ; so I 
virent into the house, and he with me, and we found them 
together very earnest in discourse. O sir, says Will Atkins, 
when God has sinners to reconcile to himself, and aliens to 
bring home, he never wants a messenger ; my wife has got a 
new instructor ; I knew I was as unworthy as I was incapa- 
ble of that work ; that young woman has been sent hithei 
from heaven ; she is enough to convert a whole island of 
savages. The young woman blushed, and rose up to go 
away, but I desired her to sit still ; I told her she had a 
good work upon her hands, and I hoped God would bless 
her in it. 

We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had any 
book among them, though I did not ask : but I put my hand 
into my pocket, and pulled out my Bible ; Here, says I to 
Atkins, I have brought you an assistant that perhaps you 
had not before. The man was so confounded that he was 
not able to speak for some time ; but recovering himself, he 
takes it with both his hands, and turning to his wife. Here, 
my dear, says he, did I not tell you our God, though he livet 
above, could hear what we said ? Here's the book I prayca 
for when you and I kneeled down under the bush ; now God 
has heard us, and sent it. When he had said so, the man 
fell into such transports of passionate joy, that between the 
»oy of having it, and giving God thanks for it, the tears ran 
down his face like a child that was crying. 

The woman was surprised, and was like to have run into 
ft mistake that Qone of us were aware of, for she firmly \^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 494 

Keved God liad sent the book upon her husbLnd*8 petition, 
it is true, that providentially it was so, and might be taken 
BO in a consequent sense ; but I believe it would have been 
Qo difficult matter, at that time, to have persuaded the poor 
woman to have believed that an express messenger came 
from heaven on purpose to bring that individual book ; but 
it was too serious a matter to suffer any delusion to lake 
place ; so I turned to the young woman, and told her we did 
not desire to impose upon the new convert, in her first and 
more ignorant understanding of things, and begged her to 
explain to her that God may be very properly said to answer 
our petitions when, in the course of his providence, such 
things are in a particular manner brought to pass as we peti- 
tioned for ; but we did not expect returns from Heaven in a 
miraculous and particular manner, and it is our mercy that it 
is not so. 

This the young woman did afterwards effectually, so thai 
there was, I assure you, no priestcraft used here ; and I 
should have thought it one of the most unjustifiable frauds 
in the world to have had it so. But the surprise of joy upon 
Will Atkins is really not to be expressed ; and there, we 
may be sure, was no delusion. Sure no man was ever more 
thankful in the world for anything of its kind than he waa 
for the Bible ; nor, I believe, never any man was glad of a 
Bible from a better principle ; and though he had been a 
most profligate creature, headstrong, furious, and desperately 
wicked, yet this man is a standing rule to us all for the well 
instructing children, viz., that parents should never give over 
to teach and instruct, nor ever despair of the success of their 
endeavors, let the children be ever so refractory, or, to ap- 
pearance, insensible of instruction ; for, if ever God, in his 
providence, touches the conscience of such, the force of their 
education returns upon them, and the early instruction oi 
parents is not lost, though it may have been m%ny years laid 
asleep, but, some time or other, they may find the benefit 0/

it. Tbui it was with th s poor man: however igncrant hi 
was of religion and ('hristian knowledge, he found he had 
some to do with now more ignorant than himself, and that 
the least part of the instruction of his good father that non 
came to his mind was of use to him. 

Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how his fathei 
Uficd to insist so much on the inexpressible value of th« 
Bible, the privilege and blessing of it to nations, families. 
and persons : but he never entertained the least notion ci 
the worth of it till now, when being to talk to heathens, 
savages, and barbarians, he wanted the help of the written 
oracle for his assistance. 

The young woman was glad of it also for the present occa- 
sion, though she had one, and so had the youth, on board 
our ship, among their goods, which were not yet brought on 
shore. And now having said so many things of this young 
woman, I cannot omit telling one story more of her and 
myself, which has something in it very informing and 
remarkable. 

I have related to what extremity the poor young woman 
was reduced, how her mistress was starved to death, and 
died on board that unhappy ship we met at sea, and how the 
whole ship's company was reduced to the last extremity. 
The gentlewoman and her son, and this maid, were first 
hardly used, as to provisions, and at last totally neglected 
and starved ; that is to say, brought to the last extremity 
of hunger. — One day, being discoursing with her on the 
extremities they suffered, I asked her if she could describe, 
by what she had felt, what it was to starve, and how ii 
appeared? She told me she believed she could, and sho 
told her tale very distinctly, thus : 

First, sir, said she, we had for some days fared exceeding 
hard, and suffered very great hunger : but at last we were 
whf.lly without food of any kind, except sugar, and a little 
vine ind water. The first day, after I had rece ved no food 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 495 

hi all, I found myself, towards evening, first empty and sick 
at the stomach, and nearer night much inclined to yawning 
and s.eep. 1 laid down on a couch in the great cabin to 
sleep, and slept about three hours, and awaked a little 
refreshed, having taken a glass of wine when I lay down : 
after being about three hours awake, it being about fi\8 
o'clock in the morning, I found myself empty, and my 
stomach sickish, and lay down again, but could not sleep at 
all, being very faint and ill ; and thus I continued all the 
second day, with a strange variety, first hungry, then sick 
again, with retchings to vomit. The second night, being 
obliged to go to bed again without any food, more than a 
draught of fresh water, and being asleep, I dreamed I was 
at Barbadoes, and that the market was mightily stocked 
with provisions ; that I bought some for my mistress, and 
went and dined very heartily. I thought my stomach was 
as full after this as it would have been after a good dinner ; 
but when I awaked, I was exceedingly sunk in my spirits to 
find myself in the extremity of famine. The last glass 01 
wine we had I drank, and put sugar in it, because of its 
having some spirit to supply nourishment ; but there being 
no substance in the stomach for the digesting oflSce to work 
upon, I found the only efiect of the wine was, to raise dis- 
agreeable fumes from the stomach into the head : and I lay, 
as they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk, for 
some time. The third day, in the morning, after a night 01 
strange, confused, and inconsistent dreams, and rather dozing 
than sleeping, I awaked ravenous and furious with hunger ; 
and I question, had not my understanding returned and 
conquered it, whether, if I had been a mother, and had had 
a little child with me, its life would have been safe or not. 
This lasted about three hours ; during which time I wai 
twice raging mad as any creature in Bedlam, as my young 
Diascer told me, and as he can now inform you.

&nd struck oi) face against, the comer of a pallet bed, ii 
firhich my mist ress lay, and, with the blow, the blood gushed 
out of my nose; and the cabin-boy bringing me a little 
^asin, I sat down and bled into it a great deal ; and as the 
blood came from me, I came to myself, and the violence ol 
the flame or fever I was in abated, and so did the ravenous 
p^rt of the hunger. Then I grew sick, and retched to 
vomit, but could not, for I had nothing in my stomach to 
biing up. After I had bled some time, I swooned, and they 
aJ believed 1 was dead ; but I came to myself soon after, 
and then had a most dreadful pain in my stomach, not to be 
described, not like the colic, but a gnawing, eager puin for 
lood ; and towards the night it went off, with a kind of ear- 
nest wishing or longing for food, something like, as I sup- 
pose, the longing of a woman with child. I took another 
draught of water, with sugar in it ; but my stomach loathed 
^he sugar, and brought it all up again : then I took a 
draught of water without sugar, and all stayed with me ; and 
I laid me down upon the bed, praying me most heartily that 
it would please God to take me away ; and composing my 
mind in hopes of it, I slumbered awhile, and then waking, 
thought myself dying, being light with vapors from an 
empty stomach ; 1 recommended my soul then to God, and 
earnestly wished that somebody would throw me into the 
sea. 

All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I thought, 
expiring, but bore it with much more patience than I ; 
gave the last bit of bread she had left to her child, my young 
master, who would not have taken it, but she obliged him 
to eat it ; and I believed it saved his life. 

Towards the morning I slept again ; and when I awoke, 
( fell into a violent passion of crying, and after that had a 
pecond fit of violent hunger : I got up ravenous, and in a 
most dreadful condition; had my mistress been doad, at 
unch at 1 loved her, I am certain I should have eaten a 



KOBINSON CIIUSOE. 4^f 

piece of her heah, with as much relish, and as iincoticeined. 
dts evei I did eat the flesh of any creature appointed foi 
food ; and once or twice I was going to bite my own arm ; 
at last I saw the basin in which was the blood I bad bled dt 
my nose the day before : 1 ran to it, and swallowed it with 
Buch haste, and such a greedy appetite, as if I wondered no- 
bcdy had taken it before, and afraid it should be taken from 
me now. After it was down, though the thoughts of it 
tilled me with horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger, and I 
If ok another draught of water, and was composed and re 
freshed for some hours after. This was the fourth day ; and 
thus I held it till towards night ; when, within the compasi 
of tliree hours, I had all the several circumstances ovei 
again, one after another, viz,, sick, sleepy, eagerly hunj^ry, 
pain in the stomach, then ravenous again, then sick, then 
lunatic, then crying, then ravenous again, and so every 
quarter of an hour ; and my strength wasted exceedingly ; 
at night I laid me down, having no comfort but in the hope 
that I should die before morning. 

All this night 1 had no sleep ; but the hunger was now 
turned into a disease ; and 1 had a terrible colic and griping, 
by wind, instead of food, having found its way into the 
bowels ; and in this condition 1 lay till morning, when 1 
was surprised with the cries and lamentations of my young 
master, who called out to me that his mother was dead : 1 
lifted myself up a little, for I had not strength to rise, but 
found she was not dead, though she was able to give very 
little signs of life. 

I had then such convulsions in my stomach, for want of 
■ome sustenance, that I cannot describe ; with such freque-t 
tliroes and pangs of appetite, that nothing but the tortures of 
death can imitate ; and in this condition 1 was when I heard 
^he seamen above cry out, A sail ! a sail ! and halloo and 
ump all out as if they were distracted.

mu ;h )e«i ; and my young master was so sick, that I thoi^gn 
he had been expiring ; so we could not open the cabin dooi 
or get any account what it was that occasioned such confu- 
sion ; nor had we any coaversation mth the ship*s company 
for two days, they having told us that they had not a mouth- 
ful of an) thng to eat in the ship ; and this they told us af- 
terwards, they thought we had been dead. It was this 
dreadful condition we were in when you were sent to save 
cur lives ; and how you found us, sir, you know as well as I, 
And better too. 

This was her own relation, and is such a distinct account 
of starving to death, as I confess, I never met with, and wua 
exceeding entertaining to me. I am the rather apt to believe 
it to be a true account, because the youth gave me an ac- 
count of a good part of it ; though, I must own, not so dis- 
tinct and so feeling as the maid : and the rather, because it 
seems his mother fed him at the price of her own life ; but 
the poor maid, though her constitution being stronger than 
that of her mistress, who was in years, and a weakly woman 
too, she might struggle harder with it : I say, the poor maid 
might be supposed to feel the extremity something soonei 
than her mistress, who might be allowed to keep the last 
bit something longer than she parted with any to relieve the 
maid. No question, as the case is here related, if <»ur ship, 
or some other, had not providentially met them, a few days 
more would have ended all their lives, unless they had pre* 
vented it by eating one another ; and that even, as their ca«» 
stood, would have served them but a little while, they being 
five hundred leagues from any land, or any possibility of 
relief, other than in the miraculous manner it happjened : but 
this is by the way : I return to my disposition of thmj?t 
fimong the people. 

And, first, it is to be observed here, that for many rea- 
sons I did not think fit to let them know anything of the 
•!oop I 1" ad framed, and which I thought of setting up 



ROBIXSON CRUSOE. 499 

tmong flieir ; for 1 found, at least at my first coiiAing, such 
seeds of divisions among them, that I saw plainly, had I set 
up the sloop, and left it among them, they would, upon 
every light disgust, have separated, and gone away from one 
another, or perhaps have turned pirates, and so made the 
bland a den of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober and 
religious people, as I intended it ; nor did I leave the two 
pieces of brass cannon that I had on board, or the two 
quarter-deck guns that my nephew took extraordinary, for 
the same reason : I thought it was enough to qualify them 
for a defensive war against any that should invade them, but 
not to set them up for an offensive war, or to go abroad to 
attack others ; which, in the end, would only bring ruin and 
destruction upon them : I reserved the sloop, therefore, and 
the guns, for their service another way, as I shall observe in 
As place. 

Having now done with the island, I left them all in good 
circumstances, and in a flourishing condition, and went on 
board my ship again the 6th of May, having been about 
twenty-five days among them ; and as they were all resolved 
to stay upon the island till I came to remove them, I 
promised to send them farther relief from the Brazils, if I 
could possibly find an opportunity : and, particularly, I 
promised to send them some cattle, such as sheep, hogs, and 
cows ; as to the two cows and calves which I brought from 
Elngland, we had been obliged, by the length of our voyage, 
t) lull them at sea, for want of hay to feed them.

The next day, giving them a sulute of five guns at parting 
we set sail, and arrived at the bay of All Saints, in the 
Brazils, in about twenty-two days, meeting nothing remark- 
able in our passage but this : that about three days after we 
had sailed, being becalmed, and the current setting strong to 
the E.N.E., running, as it were, into a buy or gulf on the 
land side, we were driven something out of our course, and 
once or twice our men cried out. Land to the eastward ; but 
whether it was the continent or islands we could not tell by 
any means. But the third day, towards evening, the sea 
smooth, and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were, 
covered towards the land with something very black ; not 
being able to discover what it was, till after some time, our 
chief mate, going up to the main-shrouds a little way, and 
looking at them with a perspective, cried out it was an army, 
I could not imagine what he meant by an army, and thwarted 
nim a little hastily. Nay, sir, says he, don't be angry, foi 
'tis an army, and a fleet too ; for 1 believe there are a thou- 
sand canoes, and you may see them paddle along, for they 
are coming towards us apace. 

I was a little surprised, then, indeed, and so was my 
nephew the captain ; for he had heard such terrible storiei 
of them in the island, and having never been in those seat 
before, that he could not tell what to think of it, but said, 
two or three times, we should all be devoured. I must 
confess considering we were becalmed, and the current set 
•trcng towards the shore, I liked it the worse ; however. I 



KOBINJSUJN CRUSOE. 501 

bade them not be afraid, but bring the ship to an anchoi 
AS soon as we came so near to know that we must engagt 
them. 

The weather continued calm, and they came on apao6 
towards us ; so I gave order to come to an anchor, and fuiC 
all our sails : as for the savages, I told them they had 
nothing to fear but fire, and therefore they should get theii 
boats out, and fasten them, one close by the head, and the 
other by the stern, and man them both well, and wait the 
Usue in that posture : this I did, that the men in the boats 
might be ready with sheets and buckets to put out any fire 
these savages would endeavour to fix to the outside of the 
ship. 

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while 
\\ey came up with us ; but never was such a horrid sight 
seen by Christians : though my mate was much mistaken in 
nis calculation of their number, yet when they came up we 
reckoned about a hundred and twenty-six; some of them 
had sixteen or seventeen men in them, some more, and the 
least six or seven. 

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck 
with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight which doubtless 
they had never seen before ; nor could they, at first, as wc 
afterwards understood, know what to make of us ; they 
came boldly up, however, very near to us, and seemed to go 
about to row round us ; but we called to our men in the 
boats not to let them come too near them. This very ordei 
bi ought us to an engagement with them, without out 
designing it : for five or six of the large canoes came so 
near our longboat that our men beckoned with their hand* 
to keep them back, which they understood very well, and 
went back, but at their retreat about fifty arrows came on 
board us from those boats, and one of our men in the long- 
boat was very much wounded. However, I called to them- 
act to ^ye by iny means ; but we handed down some deal 



M2 ADYBNrURES OF 

boards into the boat, and the carpenter p esenl./ set uf « 
kind of fence, like waste boards, to cover them from t^« 
trrows of the savages, if they should shoot again. 

About half an hour afterwards they all came up in a body 
astern of us, and so near, as that we could easily discern 
«»hat they were, though we could not tell their design ; and 
1 easily found they were some of my old friends, the same 
sort of savages that I had oeen used to engage with ; and in 
a shjrt time more they rowed a little farther out to sea, till 
they Ciime directly broadside with us, and then rowed down 
straight upon us, till they came so near that they could hear 
us speak : upon this I ordered all my men to keep close, lest 
they should shoot any more arrows, and made all our guns 
ready ; but being so near as to be within hearing, I made 
Friday go out upon the deck, and call out aloud to tliem in 
his language, to know what they meant ; which accordingly 
he did. Whether they understood him or not, that I knew 
not ; but as soon as he had called to them, six of them, who 
were in the foremost or nighest boat to us, turned their 
canoes from us, and stooping down, showed us their naked 
Ibrms, accompanied with many indecent jcstures and extrava- 
gances: whether this was a defiance or challenge we know 
^)ot, or wht ther it was done in mere contempt, or as a signal to 
thorest; hut iminediatfly Friday cried out they were going 
to shoot, and, unhappily for him, poor fellow, they let fly about 
three hundretl of their arrows, and, to my inexpressible griel, 
Killed poor Friday, no other man being in their sight. The 
p<>or fellow was shot with no less than three arrows, and 
about three more fell very near him ; such unlucky marksmen 
they were ! 

I was so enraged at the loss of my old trusty servant and 
t!0!ni»anion, that I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded 
with small shot, and four with great, and gave them such a 
oroadside as they had never heard in their lives before, ta 
be sure. They were not above half a cable length off when 




DEATH OF FRIDAY

we fir&d ; and our gunners took their aim so well thai thre€ 
or four of their canoes were overset, as we had reason to be* 
lieve, by one shot only. 

The ill manners of turning up their bare backsides to uf 
gave us no great offence ; neither did I know for certain 
whether that which would pass for the gr^est contempt 
among us might be understood so by them or not ; there- 
fore, in return, I had only resolved to have fired four ol 
five guns at them with powder only, which I knew would 
frighten them sufficiently : but when they shot at us directly, 
with all the fury they were capable of, and especially as they 
had killed my poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved and 
valued, and who, indeed, so well deserved it, I thought my- 
self not only justifiable before God and man, but would have 
been very glad if 1 could have overset every canoe there, and 
drowned every one of them. 

i can neither tell how many we killed, nor how many we 
wounded, at this broadside, but sure such a fright and hurry 
never was seen among such a multitude ; there were thirteen 
or fourteen of their canoes split and overset in all, and the 
men all set a swimming : the rest, frightened out of their 
wits, scoured away as fast as they could, taking but little 
care to save those whose boats were split or spoiled with our 
shot ; so I suppose that many of them were lost ; and our 
men took up one poor fellow swimming for his life, above an 
hour afler they were all gone. 

The small shot from our cannon must needs kill and 
wound a great many ; but, in short, we never knew anything 
ac w it went with them, for they fled so fast, that in three 
hours, or thereabouts, we could not see above three or four 
itraggling canoes, nor did we ever see the rest any more ; for 
* breeze of wind springing up the same evening, we weighec^ 
and set sail for the Brazils. 

We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was so sulleii 
4iat he would neither eat nor speak, and we all fancied 



)U4 ADVENTURES OF 

Qe would starve himself to death : but I took a waj to iurt 
bim ; for I made them take him and turn him into the long- 
boat, and make him believe they would toss him into the 
tea again, and so leave him where they found him, if he 
would not speak : nor would that do, but they really did 
throw him into nie sea, and came away from him, and then 
he followed them, for he swam like a cork, and called to 
Hiem, in his tongue, though they knew not one word of whai 
.le said : however, at last they took him in again, and then 
he began to be more tractable ; nor did I ever design they 
should drown him. 

We were now under sail again ; but I was the most dis- 
consolate creature alive for want of my man Friday, and 
would have been very glad to haveg one back to the island to 
have taken one of the rest from there for my occasiop ; but it 
could not be ; so we went on. We had one prisoner, as I have 
laid, and it was a long time before we could make him un- 
ierstand anything ; but, in time, our men t«ught him some 
Knglish, and he began to be a little tractable. Afterwards, 
we inquired what country he came from, but could make 
nothing of what he said ; for his speech was so odd, all gut- 
turals, and he spoke in the throat in such a hollow, odd 
ortanner, that we could never form a word after him ; and 
we were all of opinion that they might speak that language 
as well if they were gagged as otherwise ; nor could we per- 
cei\'e that they had any occasion either for teeth, tongue, 
lips, or palate, but formed their words just as a hunting horn 
forms s tune, with an open throat. He told uh, he wever, 
»ome time after, when we had taught him to speak i little 
English, that they were going with their kings to fight a 
great battle. When he said kings, we asked him how many 
kings? He said they were five nation (we could not make 
him understand the plural s), and that they all joined to go 
ligainst two nation. We asked him what made them coma 
ip to us ? He said, ** To makee te great wonder look.*

He re it is t j be observed, that all those natives, as also those 
•A Africa, when they learn English, always add two e's at 
the end of the words where we use one ; and they place tho 
accent upon them, as makee, takee, and the like ; and we 
could not break them of it ; nay I could hardly make Fri- 
day leave it off, though at last he did. 

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must take 
ray last leave of him : Poor honest Friday ! We burie<l 
him with all the decency and solemnity possible, by putting 
aim into a coffin, and throwing him into the sea ; and 1 
caused them to fire eleven guns for him : and so ended the 
life of the most grateful, faithful, honest, and most affec- 
tionate servant, that ever man had. 

We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil ; and in 
about twelve days* time we made land, in the latitude of five 
degrees south of the line, being the north-eastermost land of 
all that part of America. We kept on S. by E. in sight of 
the shore four days, when we made Cape St. Augustine, and 
in three days came to an anchor off the bay of All Saints, 
the old place of my deliverance, from whence came both my 
good and evil fate. 

Never ship came to this port that had less business than I 
had, and yet it was with great difficulty that we were admit- 
ted to hold the least correspondence on shore ; not my part- 
ner himself, who was alive, and made a great figure among 
them, not my two merchant trustees, not the fame of my 
wonderful preservation in the island, could obtain me that 
favor ; but my partner remembering that I had given five 
hundred moidores to the priory of the monastery of the Au- 
gustines, and two hundred and seventy-two to the poor, went 
to the monastery, and obliged the prior that then was, to go 
to the governor, and get leave for me personally, with the 
captain and one more, besides eight seamen, tf come on 
shore, and no more; and this upon condition abiolutely

They were so strict with us as to landing and goods, that il 
was with extreme difficulty that I got on shore three balet 
of English goods, such as fine broad-cloths, stuffs, and some 
linen, which 1 had brought for a present to my partner. 

He was a very generous, open-hearted man ; though, like 
me, he came from little at first ; and though he knew not 
that I had the least design of giving him anything, he sent 
me on board a present of fresh provision, wine, and sweet* 
meats, worth above thirty moidores, including some tobacco, 
and three or four fine medals of gold : but I was even with 
him in my present, which, as I have said, consisted of fine 
s)road-cloth, English stuffs, lace, and fine hollands: also I 
delivered him about the value of one hundred pounds ster- 
ling, in the same goods, for other uses ; and I obl'^ed him 
to set up the sloop, which 1 had brought with me ^ >m Eng 
land, as I have said, for the use of my colony, i order to 
send the refreshments I intended to my plantation 

Accordingly, he got handstand finished the >Joop in a 
very few days, for she was already framed ; and I gave the 
master of her such instructions as that he could not miss the 
place ; nor did he miss them, as I had an account from my 
partner afterwards. I got him soon loader with the small 
cargo I sent them ; and one of our seam' r , that had been 
on shore with me there, offered to go ^ath the sloop and 
settle there, upon my letter to the governor Spaniard to allot 
him a sufficient quantity of land for a plantation, and giving 
him some clothes and tools for his planting work, which ha 
said he understood, having been &* old planter at Maryland, 
diml a buccaneer into the bargair I encouraged the fellow, 
by granting all he desired ; and as an addition, I gave him 
the savage whom we had taken prisoner of war to be hii 
ilavc, and ordered the governor Spaniard to give him hif 
fhare of everything he wanted with the rest. 

When we came to fit this man out, my old parti er told m 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. §0^ 

there was a certain very honest fellow, a I?razil plA.iter of 
his acquaintance, who had fallen into the displeasure of thi 
church, 1 know not what the matter is with him, says he 
but on my conscience 1 think he is a heretic in his heart, and 
he has been obliged to conceal himself for fear of the Inqui« 
sition ; that he would be very glad of such an opportunity 
to make his escape, with his wife, and two daughters ; and 
if 1 would let them go to my island, and allot them a planta- 
tion, he would give them a small stock to begin with ; for 
the officers of the Inqusition had seized all his effects and 
estate, and he had nothing left but a little household stuff, 
and two slaves : and, adds he, though I hate his principles, 
yet I would not have him fall into their hands, for he will 
be assuredly burned alive if he does. 

I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with 
them ; and we concealed the man, and nis wife and 
daughters, on board our ship, till the sloop put out to go to 
»ea^ and then, having put all their goods on board some 
time before, we put them on board the sloop after she was 
got out of the bay. 

Our seamen was mightily pleased with this new partner ; 
and their stocks, indeed, were much alike rich in tools, in 
preparations, and a farm ; but nothing to begin with, except 
as above : however, they carried over with them, which was 
worth all the rest, some materials for planting sugarcanes, 
with some plants of canes, which he, I mean the Portugal 
man, understood very well. 

Among the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants in the 
island, I sent them by the sloop three milch cows and five 
c lives, about twenty-two hogs among them, three sows bijj 
with pig, two mares, and a stonehorse. For. my Spaniards, 
according to my promise, I engaged three Portugal won: en 
to go, and recommended it to them to marry them, and us# 
»hem kindly, I could have procured more women, but I re 
nembered that the poor prosecuted man bid two dai j^htera

and that tacre were but five of the Spaniards that \i \nted 
the rest had wivei of their own, thoigh in anothei 
country. 

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily sup* 
pose, was very welcome to ray old inhabitants, who wert 
now, with this addition, between sixty and seventy pecple, 
besides little children, of which there were a great many. I 
iOund letters at London from them all, by way of Lisbon, 
when I came back to England, of which I shall also take 
lome notice immediately. 

1 have now done with the island, and all manner of dis-

randums would do well to turn his thoughts entirely from it, 
and expect to x^ad of the follies of an old man, not warned 
by his own harms, much less by those of other men, to be- 
ware of the like ; not cooled by almost forty years* miseries

expectation, nor made cautious by afilictions and distress he^

1 had no more business to go to the East Indies than a 
man at full liberty has to go to the turnkey at Newgate, and 
desire him to lock him up among the prisoners there, anc 
starve him. Had I taken a small vessel froiA England, and 
gone directly to the island ; had I loaded her, as I did the 
other vessel, with all the necessaries for the plantation, and 
for my people ; taken a patent from the government here to 
have secured my property, in subjection only to that of Eng- 
land ; had 1 carried over cannon and ammunition, servant-s, 
and people to plant, and taken possession of the place, forti- 
fied and strengthened it in the name of England, and in 
cteased it with peo-^le, as I migl easily have done ; had J 
theu settled myseli there, and sent the ship back laden with 
good rice, as 1 might also have done in six months' time, and 
ordered my friends to have fitted her out again for our sup*

Itast acted like a man of common sense; but I iv^as pot* 
iessed with a wandering spirit, and scorned all ad antages : 
I pleased myself with being the patron of the people 1 
placdd there, and doing for them in a kind of haughty, ma 
iestic way, like an old patriarchal monarch, providing foi 
them as if I had been father of the whole family, as well ai 
of the plantation: but I never so much as pretended to 
plant in the name of any government or nation, or to ac- 
knowledge any prince, or to call my people subjects to any 
one nation more than another : nay, I never so much as gave 
the place a name, but left it, as I found it, belonging to no- 
body, and the people under no discipline or government but my 
own ; wno, though I had influence over them as a father and 
oenefactor, had no authority or power to act or command one 
way or other, farther than voluntary consent moved them to 
comply : yet even this, had I stayed there, would have done 
well enough ; but as I rambled from them, and came there 
no more, the last letters I had from any of them were by my 
partner's means, who afterwards sent another sloop to the 
place, and who sent me word, though I had not the letter 
till I got to London, several years after it was written, that 
they went on but poorly, were malcontent with their long 
stay there ; that Will Atkins was dead ; that five of the 
Spaniards were come away ; and though they had not been 
much molested by the savages, yet they had had some skir* 
mishes with them ; and that they begged of him to write to me 
to think of the promise I had made to fetch them away, that 
they might see their country again before they died. 

But I was gone a wildgoose chase, indeed ! and they tl at 
will have any more of me must be content to follow me into 
ft new variety of follies, hardships, and wild adventures, 
wherein the justice of Providence may be duly observed; 
ftnd we may see how easily Heaven can gorge us with our 
own desires, make the strongest of our wisnes be our afflic 
tian, and punish us most severely with those very thing!

^;3 ADVENTURES OF 

the ii.and of Madagascar, wb=re, though the piople ai% 
fierce and treacherous, and very well armed with lances and 
bows, which they use with inccnceivable dexterity, yet we 
fared very well with them a while; they treated us very 
civilly ; and, for some trifles which we gave them, such aa 
knives, scissors, &.C., they brought us eleven good fat bul- 
locks of a middling size, which we took in, partly for fresh 
provisions for our present spending, and the rest to salt for 
the %hip*s use. 

Wc were obliged to stay here some time after we had fui- 
nished ourselves with provisions ; and I, who was always 
too curious to look into every nook of the world wherever I 
came, was for going on shore as often as 1 could. It was on 
the east side of the island that we went on shore one 
evening ; and the people, who, by the way, are very numer- 
ous, came thronging about us, and stood gating at us at a 
distance ; but as we had traded freely with them, and had 
been kindly used, we thought ourselves in no danger ; but 
when we saw the people, we cut three boughs out of a tree, 
and stuck them up at a distance from us ; which, it seems, 
b a mark in that country, not only of truce and friendship, 
but when it is accepted, the other side sets up three poles or 
boughs, which is a signal that they accept the truce too ; 
but then this is a known condition of the truce, that you are 
not to pass beyond their three poles, towards them, nor thcv 
to come past your thjree poles, or boughs, towards you ; 90 
that you are perfectly secure within the three poles, and all 
the space between your poles and theirs is allowed like a 
market for free converse, traffic, and commerce. When you 
fz there, you must not carry your weapons with you ; and 
S they come into that space, they stick up their javelins and 
lances all at the first poles, and come on unarmed : but il 
my violence is offered them, and the truce thereby broken, 
tway they run to the poleS; and lay hold of their weaponi| 
<%nd the truce is at an end. 



ROBIiNSON CKUSOE. ^\^ 

It happened one evening when we went on shore, th*t ■ 
greater number of the people came down than usual, but all 
very friendly and civil ; and they brought several kinds ol 
provisions, for which we satisfied them with such toys 8<* W6 
had ; the 'r women, also, brought us milk and roots, ana 
teveial things very acceptable to us, and all was quiet; and 
we made us ^ little tent or hut of some boughs of treeti 
and l&y on shore all night. 

I know not what was the occasion, but I was not so well 
B itisfied to lie on shore as the rest ; and the boat riding at 
an anchor about a stone's cast from the land, with two men 
in her to take care of her, I made one of them come on 
shore ; and getting some boughs of trees to cover us also in 
the boat, I spread the sail on the bottom of the boat, and 
lay under the coyer of the branches of the trees all night in 
the boat. 

About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of our 
men make a terrible noise on the shore, calling out, for 
God's sake, to bring the boat in, and come and help them, 
for they were all like to be murdered ; at the same time I 
heard the fire of five muskets, which was the number of the 
guns they had, and that three times over ; for, it seems, the 
natives here were not so easily Mghtened with guns as the 
savages were in America, where I had to do with them. 
All this while I knew not what was the matter, but rousing 
immediately from sleep with the noise, I caused the boat to 
be thrust in, and resolved, with three frisees we had on 
board, to land and assist our men. 

We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men were in 
too much haste ; for being come to the shore, they plunged 
into the water, to get to the boat with all the expedition 
they could, being pursued by between three and four hun« 
dred men. Our men were but nine in all, and only five of 
(hem had fusees with them ; the rest had pistols and swords 
Udeed, but they were of small use to them. 



^14 ADVENTURES OF 

We look up scren of our men, and with difRculty enc ftgk 
too, three of them being very ill wounded ; and that which 
was tftill worse was, that while we stood in the boat to tako 
our men in, we were in as much danger as they were in on 
shore ; for they poured their arrows in upon us so thick, 
that we were glad to barricade the side of the boat up with 
the benches, and two or three loose boards^ which, to out 
great satisfaction, we had by mere accident in the boat. 
And yet, had it been daylight, they are, it seems, such 
exact marksmen, that if they could have seen but the least 
part of any us, they would have been sure of us. We had, 
by the light of the moon, a little sight of them, as they 
stood pelting us from the shore with darts and arrows ; and 
having got ready our fire-arms, we gave them a volley, that 
we could hear, by the cries of some of them, had wounded 
several : however, they stood thus in battle array on the 
shore till break of day, which we suppose was that they 
might see the better to take their aim at us. 

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh 
our anchor or set up our sail, because we must needs stand 
up in the boat, and they were sure to hit us as we were to 
hit a bird in a tree with small shot. We made signals of 
distress to the ship, which,«though she rode a league off, yet 
my nephew, the captain, hearing our firing, and by glasses 
perceiving the posture we lay in, and that we fired towards 
the shore, pretty well understood us ; and weighing anchor 
with all speed, he stood as near the shore as he durst with 
the ship, and then sent another boat, with ten hands in her, 
to assist «is ; but we called to them not to come too near, tell- 
er g them what condition we were in ; however they stood 
in near to us, and one of the men taking the end of a tow- 
line in his hand, and keeping one boat between him and the 
enemy, so that they could not perfectly see him, swam oo 
board us, and made fast the line to the boat ; upon which 
we slipped out a little cable, and leaving our anchor behind. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 61a 

eiicy towed us out of the reach of the arrows ; we all the 
tvhile lying close behind the barricado wc had made. 

As soon as we were got from between the ship and tht 
the shore, that wi coi.ld lay her side to the shore, she run 
ilong just by them, and poured in a broadside among them 
loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small bullets, and such 
•taff^ besides, the great shot, which made a terrible havoc 
%mong them. 

When we were got on board and out of danger, we ha<l 
time to examine into the occasion of this fray ; and, indeed, 
;»ur supercargo, who had been often in those parts, put me 
ipon it ; for he said he was sure the inhabitants would not 
have touched us after we had made a truce, if we had not done 
•omething to provoke them to it. At length it came out 
that an old woman who had come to sell us some milk, had 
l»rought it within our poles, and a young woman with her, 
who also brought some roots or herbs ; and while the old 
woman (whether she was mother to the young woman or no 
they could not tell) was selling ^us the milk, one of our men 
offered some rudeness to the wench that was with her, ai 
which the old woman made a great noise ; however, the sea- 
man would not quit his prize, but carried her out of the old 
woman's sight among the trees, it being almost dark: the 
old woman went away without her, and, as we may suppose, 
made an outcry among the people she came from, who, upon 
notice, raised this great army upon us in three or four houitf ; 
and it was great odds but we had all been destroyed. 

One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him 
just at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of tht 
tent they had made : the rest came off free, all but tho fel- 
low who was the occasion of all the mischief, who puid dear 
enough for his black mistress, for we could not hear what 
became of him a great while. We lay upon the shore twc 
days after thou^rh the wind presentctd, and made signals foi 
aim, and made ouf boat sail dp shore and down shott

lereial lea/ues, but in vain, so we were obliged to give him 
over; and if he alone had suffered for it, the loss had beea 
kess. 

I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing oc 
ihoie once more, to try if 1 could learn anything of him oi 
them : it was the third night after the action that I had a 
great mind to learn, if 1 could by any means, what mischiel 
we bad done, and how the game stood on the Indian*s side. 
1 was careful to do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked 
again ; but I ought, indeed, to have been sure that the men 
I went with had been under my command, before I engaged 
m a thing so hazardous and mischievous, as I was brought 
into by it without design. 

We took twenty as stout fellows with us as any in the 
ship, besides the supercargo and myself, and we landed two 
hours before midnight, at the same place where the Indians 
stood drawn up in the evening before : I landed here, be- 
cause my design, as I have said, was chiefly to see if they 
had quitted the field, and if ^they had left any marks behind 
them of the mischief we had done them ; and I thought if 
we could surprise one or two of them, perhaps we might get 
our man again, by way of exchange. 

We landed without any noise, and divided our men into 
two bodies, whereof the boatswain commanded one, and I 
the other. We neither saw nor heard anybody stir when we 
lauded ; and we marched up, one body at a distance from 
the other, to the place ; but at first coidd see nothing, i. 
being very dark ; till by and by our boatswain, who led the 
first party, stumbled and fell over a dead body. This made 
Ihem halt awhile ; for knowing by the circumstances that 
they were at the place where the Indians had stood, tbey 
waited for my coming up there. We concluded to halt tiU 
the moon began to rise, which we knew would be in lesM 
*;han an hour, when we could easily discern the havoc wi 
hid made am ng them. We told thirty- two bodies upoa 



ROLINSON CRUSOE. ^j* 

the gi iiind, whereof two were not quite dead , some had aa 
irm, and some a leg shot off, and one his hand ; those taal 
were wounded, we suppose, they had carried away. 

When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery of all 
we could come to the knowledge of, I was resolved for going 
on board ; but the boatswain and his party sent me word 
that they were resolved to make a visit to tlie Indian town, 
where these dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and asked mt 
to go along with them ; and if they could find them, as they 
still fancied they shoulij, they did not doubt of getting a 
good booty ; and it might be they might find Tom Jef&jf 
t>.ere : that was the man's name we had lost. 

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well enough, 
what answer to have given them : for I should have com- 
manded them instantly on board, knowing it was not a hazard 
fit for us to run, who had a ship, and ship-loading in our 
charge, and a voyage to make which depended very much 
upon the lives of the men ; but as they sent me word they 
were resolved to go, and only asked me and my company to 
go along with them, I positively refused it, and rose up, for 
I was sittmg on the ground, in order to go to the boat. One 
or two of the men began to importune me to go ; and when 
I reused, oegan to grumble, and say that they were not 
under my command, and they would go. Come, Jack, says 
omt of the men, will you go with me ? I'll go for one. Jack 
said he woula, — and then another, — and, in a word they 
all left me but one, whom I persuaded to stay, and a boy 
left in the boat. So the supercargo and I with the third 
man, went bac& to the boat, where we told them we should 
stay for them, and take care to take in as many of them sit 
should be left ; for I told them it was a mad thing they were 
f(oing about, and supposed most of them would run the fate 
of Tom Jeffry. 

They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they 
would come off again, and they would take care, &/C. ; so

Kway tliey went. I entreated them to consider tie ihip ^nd 
the "oyage, tnat their lives were not their cwn, and that 
they were entrusted with the voyage, in some measure ; that 
f tl ey miscarned, the ship might be lost ff.r want of their 
help, and that they could not answer for it to God or man. 
But 1 might as well have talked to the mainmast of thr 
ship ; they were mad upon their journey, only they gave me 
good words, and begged I would not be angry ; that they did 
not doubt but they would be back again in about an hour at 
farthest ; for the Indian town they said, was not above a half 
a mile off, though they found it above two miles before they 
got to it. 

Well, they all went away ; and though the attempt was 
desperate, and such as none but madmen would have gone 
about, yet, to give them their due, they went about it as 
warily as boldly ; they were gallantly armed, for they had 
every man a fusee or musket, a bayonet, and a pistol ; some 
of them had broad cutlasses, some of them had hangers, and 
the boatswain and two more had poleaxes ; besides all which 
they had among them thirteen hand-grenadoes : bolder fel* 
lows, and better provided, never went about any wicked 
work in the world. 

When the) went out, their chief desire was plunder, and 
they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there ; but a cir- 
cumstance, which none of them were aware of, set them on 
fire with revenge, and made devils of them all. When they 
came to the few Indian houses which they thought had been 
the town, which was not above half a mile off, they were 
under a great disappointment, for there were not above twelve 
or thirteen houses ; und where the town was, or how big, 
they knew not They consulted, therefore, what to do, and 
were sometime before they could resolve ; for if they feil 
n|K)n these, they must cut all their throats, and it was ten u 
one but some of them might escape, it being in the niglu, 
though the moon was up ; and if one escaped, he would ran

tnd raise all the town, &o they should have a wLole ann} 
apon them : again, on the other hand, if they wont away 
and left the se untouched, for the people were all asleep, they 
could not tell which way to look for the town : howevei, the 
last was the best aavice ; so they resolved to leave them, and 
look f( r the town as well as they could. They went on a 
little way, and found a cow tied to a tree ; this, they pres- 
ently concluded, would be a good guide to them ; for, they 
said, the cow certainly belonged to the town before them, oi 
to the town behind them ; and if they untied her, they 
should see which way she went : if she went back, they had 
nothing to say to her ; but, if she went forward, they would 
follow her : so they cut the cord, which was made of twisted 
flags, and the cow went on before them, directly to the town ; 
which, as they reported, consisted of above two hundred 
houses or huts, and in some of these they found several fam- 
ilies living together. 

Here they found all in silence, as profoundly secure aa 
sleep could make them ; and, first, they called another coun> 
cil, to consider what they had to do ; and, in a word, they 
resolved to divide themselves into three bodies, and so set 
three houses on fire in three parts of the town ; and as the 
men came out, to seize them and bind them (if any resijsted, 
they need not be asked what to du then), and so to search 
the rest of the houses for plunder : but they resolved to 
march silently first through the town, and see what dimen- 
sions it was of, and if they might venture upon it or no. 

They did so, and desperately lesolved that they would 
venture upon them : but while they were animating one an- 
ct>i»r to the work, three of them, who were a little befoie 
the rest, called out aloud to them, and told them that they 
hfA found Tom Jeffry : they all ran up to the place, where 
they found t'.ie poor fellow hanging up naked by one arm, 
and his throat cut. There was axf Indian house just by the 
iree, when they found sixteen or seventeen cf the principa 



J£0 ADVENTURES OF 

Indians, who had teen concerned in the fray with us betbr^ 
and two or three of them wounded with our shot ; and ou* 
meu found they were awake, and talking one to another in 
that house, but knew not their number. 

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, 
as befoie, that they swore to one another they would be re- 
venged, and that not an Indian that came into their handf 
ihould have any quarter ; and to work they went immedi- 
ately, and yet not so madly as might be expected from the 
rage and fury they were in. Their first care was to get 
something that would soon take fire, but, after a little search, 
they found that would be to no purpose ; for most of the 
houses were low, and thatched with flags and rushes, ol 
which the country is full : so they presently made some wild- 
fire, as we call it, by wetting a little powder in the palm of 
their hands ; and in a quarter of an hour they set the town 
on fire in four or five places, and particularly that house 
where the Indians were not gone to bed. 

As soon as the fire began to blaze, the poor frightened 
creatures began to rush out to save their lives, but met with 
their fate in the attempt ; and especially at the door, where 
they drove them back, the boatswain himself killing one oi 
two with his poleaxe ; the house being large, and many in 
it, he did not care to go in, but called for a hand-grenado, 
and threw it among them, which at first frightened them, 
but, when it burst, made such havoc among them, that they 
cried out in a hideous manner. In short, most of the In- 
dians who were in the open part of the house were killed or 
hurt with the grenado, except two or three who pressed to 
the door, which the boatswain and two more kept, with theii 
bayonets on the muzzles of their pieces, and dispatched all 
that came in their way : but there was another apartment in 
•he housi}, where the prince or king, or whatever he was, and 
%eTeral others were; and ^ese were kept in till the houae^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^2. 

4rbicli was by tMs time all a light flame, fell in upon thetn, 
%nd they were smothered together. 

All this while they fired not a gun, because they would not 
waken the people faster than they could master them ; but 
the fire began to waken them fast enough, and our fr.llo"^* 
were glad to keep a little together in bodies ; for the iire 
grew so raging, all the houses being made of light com* 
bustible stuff, that they could hardly bear the street between 
them ; and their business was to follow the fire, for the siiicr 
execution ; as fast as the fire either forced the people out oJ 
those houses which were burning, or frightened them out of 
others, our people were ready at their doors to knock them 
on the head, still calling and hallooing one to another to re- 
member Tom Jeflry. 

While this was doing, I must confess I was very uneasy, 
and especially when 1 saw the flames of the town, which, it 
being night, seemed to be just by me. My nephew, the 
captain, who was roused by hb men, seeing such a fire was 
very uneasy, not knowing what the matter was, or what 
danger I was in, especially hearing the guns too, for by this 
time they began to use their fire-arms ; a thousand thoughts 
oppressed his mind concerning me and the supercargo, what 
would become of us ; and, at last, though he could ill spare 
any more men, yet not knowing what exigence we might be 
in, he takes another boat, and with thirteen men and himself 
comes on shore to me. 

He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the 
b>at, with no more than two men ; and though he was glad 
that we were well, yet he was in the same impatience i^ilh 
as to know what was doing ; for the noise continued, and 
the fiame i icreased ; in short, it was next to an impossibility 
for any man in the world to restrain their curiosity to know 
what ^ad happened, or their concern for the safety of thf 
cien: in a word, the captain told" me ks v luld go and hely 
44* 



5ii ADVENTURiih Or 

nis men, let what would come. I argued with him, hs 1 did 
before with the men, the safety of the ship, the danger oi 
the V >*yage, the interest of the owners and merchants, dtc, 
and told him 1 and the two men would go, and only see il 
we could at a distance learn what was like to be the event, 
and come back and tell him. It was all one to talk to my 
nephew, as it was to talk to the rest before ; he would go, 
be f>aid ; and he only wished he had left but ten men in the 
ship ; for he could not think of having his men lost for want 
of help ; he had rather lose the ship, the voyage, and his life 
and all ; and away he went. 

I was no more able to stay behind now than I was to per- 
suade them not to go : so, in short, the captain ordered tw^ 
men to row back the pinnace, and fetch twelve men more, 
leaving the long-boat at an anchor; and that when they 
came back, six men should keep the two boats, and six more 
come after us : so that he left only sixteen men in the ship ; 
for the whole ship's company consisted of sixty-five men, 
whereof two were lost in the late quarrel which brought this 
mischief on. 

Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt little ol 
the ground we trod on ; and being guided by the fire, we 
kept no path, but went directly to the place of the flame. H 
the noise of the guns was surprising '^o us before, the cries 
of the poor people were now quite of another nature, and 
filled us with horror. 1 must confess 1 was never at the 
sacking a city, or at the taking a town by storm. 1 bad 
heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda, in Ireland, and 
killing man, woman, and child; and I had read of Count 
Tilly sacking the city of Magdeburg, and cutting the throats 
»f twenty-two thousand of all sexes; but I never had an 
idea of the thing itself before, nor is it possible to describe 
^t, or the horror that was upon our minds at heapng it. 
However, we went on, and at length came to the town, 
though there was no entering the streets of it for the firei 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 5«D 

Tlie first object we met with was the ruins of a hut oi 
house, or luther the ashes of it, for the house was consumed ; 
and just before it, plain enough to be seen by the light ol 
the fire, lay four m"in and three women killed, and, as we 
thought, one or twc more lay in the heap among the fire ; ic 
short, there were such instances of rage altogether barbarous 
and of a fury something beyond what was human, that ^i 
thought it impossible our men could be guilty of it ; or If 
they were the authors of it, we thought they ought to l* 
every one of them put to the^worst of deaths. But this was 
not all : we saw the fire increased forward, and the cry went 
on just as the fire went on ; so that we were in the utmost 
confusion. We advanced a little way farther ; and, behold, to 
our astonishment, three naked women, and crying in a most 
dreadful manner, came fiying as if they had wings, and after 
them sixteen or seventeen men, natives, in the same terror 
and consternation, with three of our English butchers in the 
rear; who, when they could not overtake them, fired in 
among them, and one that was killed by their shot fell down 
in our sight. When the rest saw us, believing us to be their 
enemies, and that we would murder them as well as those 
that pursued them, they set up a most dreadful shriek, 
especially the women, and two of them fell down, as il 
already dead, with the fright. 

My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran chill in 
my veins, when I saw this ; and I believe, had the three 
English sailors that pursued them come on, 1 had made oui 
men kill them all : however, we took some ways to let the 
poor flying creatures know that we would not hurt them ; 
and immediately they came up to us, and kneeling dowL 
with their hands lifted up, made piteous lamentation to us to 
gave them, which we let them know we would ; whereupou 
they crept all together in a huddle close behind us, as foi 
jlirotection. I left my men drawn up together, and charging

men with me; and there was indeed a piteous spectacle 
among them ; some of them had their feet terrihly burned, 
with trampling and running through the fire, others theii 
oands burned; one of the women had fallen down in the 
are, and was very much burned before she could ffet ou 
igain ; and two or three of the men had cuts in their backf 
And thighs, from our men pursuing ; and another was sho 
Uirough the body, and died while I was there. 

I would fain have learned what the occasion of all thi^ 
was, but I could not understand one word they said ; though, 
by signs, I perceived some of them knew not what was the 
occasion themselves. I was so terrified, in my thoughts, at 
ibis outrageous attempt, that I could not stay there, but 
went back to my own men, and resolved to go into the. 
middle of the town, through tne fire, or whatever might be 
in the way, and put an end to it, cost what it would : ac- 
cordingly, as 1 came back to my men, I told them mjt resolu- 
tion, and commanded them to follow me ; when at the very 
moment came four of our men, with the boatswain at theii 
head, roving over heaps of bodies they had killed, all covered 
with blood and dust, as if they wanted more people to mas- 
sacre, when our men hallooed to them as loud as they could 
halloo ; and with much ado one of them made them hear, 
BO that they knew who we were, and came up to us. 

As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a halloo like a 
shout of triumph, for having, as he thought, more help ccme; 
and without waiting to hear me. Captain, says he, noble 
captain ! I am glad you are come ; we are not half done yet : 
rillanous hell-hound dogs ! I'll kill as many of them as pool 
Fcm has IvCrs upon his head : we have svorn to 8i>are n.'int

of them ; we'll root out the very nation of (hem from the 
•arth ; an«l th ts he ran on, out of breath too with action. 
%rA would not give us leave to speak a word. 

At last, raising my voice, that I might silence him a little, 
Jiarbarous dog ! said I, what are you doing ? I won't hava 
v>ne creature touched more, upon pain of death : 1 charge 
you upon your life, to stop your hands, and stand still here, 
or you are a dead man this minute. — Why, sir, says he, do 
you know what you do, or what they have done ? If you 
want a reason for what we have done, come hither ; and 
with that he showed me the poor fellow hanging, with his 
throat cut. 

I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time 
would have been forward enough ; but I thought they had 
Parried their rage too far, and remembered Jacob's words to 
his sons Simeon and Levi — ** Cursed be their anger, for it 
was fierce ; and their wrath, for it was cruel." But I had 
now a new task upon my hands ; for when the men I carried 
with me saw the sight, as I had done, I had as much to do 
to restrain them as I should have had with the others ; nay, 
my nephew himself fell in with them, and told me, in theii 
hearing that he was only concerned for fear of the men 
being overpowered ; and as to the people, he thought not 
on« of them ought to live ; for they hffd all glutted them- 
selves with the murder of the poor man, and that they ought 
to be used like murderers : upon these words, away ran 
eight of my men, with the boatswain and his crew, to com^ 
plete their bloody work ; and I, seeing it quite out of my 
power *o restrain them, came away pensive and sad ; for 1 
could not bear the sight, much less the. horrible noise and 
cries of the poor wretches that fell into their hands. 

I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo 
und two men, and with these walked back to the boat, ll 
■iras a very great piece of folly in me, I confess, to venturi 
«ack as it were alone ; for as it befi^an now to be almost day

and the alarm had run over the country, I: ere ft-ood about 
forty men, aimed with lances and bows, at the little place 
where the twelve or thirteen houses stood mentioned before ; 
but by accident I missed the place, and came directly to the 
f easide ; and by the time I got to the seaside it Wcos broad 
iay ; immediately I took the pinnace and went on board, 
and sent her back to assist the men in what might happen. 

1 observed about the time that I came to the boat^s side, 
that the fire was pretty well out, and the noise abated : but 
in about half an hour after I got on board I heard a volley 
of our men's fire-arms, and saw a great smoke ; this, as I 
understood afterwards, was our men falling upon the men 
who, as I said, stood at the few houses on the way, of whom 
they killed sixteen or seventeen, and set all the houses on 
fire, but did not meddle with the women or children. 

By the time the men got to the shore again with the 
pinnace, our men began to appear; they came dropping in, 
not in two bodies as they went, but straggling here and 
there in such a manner, that a small force of resolute men 
might have cut them all off. But the dread of them waa 
upon the whole country ; and the men were siurprised, and 
80 frightened, that I believe a hundred of them woi^ have 
fled at the sight of but five of our men; nor in all this 
terrible action was there a man that made any considerable 
defence ; they were so surprised when the terror of the fire 
tnd the sudden attack of our men in me. dark, that they 
Knew not which way to turn themselves ; for if they fled 
one way they were met by one party ; if back again, by 
another ; so that they were every where knocked down : 
nor did aiy of our men receive the least hurt, except one 
that sprained his foot, and another that had one of his hanis 
burned. 

1 was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and, in- 
deed, with all the men, in my mind, but with him in partic- 
ular, as well for his actins so out of his duty, as commanddi

►f the ship, and having tne charge of the voya^-e upoh tdm^ 
u in his prompting, rather than cooling, the rage of hii 
blind men, in so bloody and cruel an enterprise. My 
nephew answered me very respectfully, but told me that 
when he saw the body of the poor seaman whom they had 
murder 3d in so cruel and barbarous a manner, he was not 
master of himself, neither could he govern his passion : he 
jwned he should not have done so, as he was commandei of 
the ship ; but as he was a man, and nature moved him, he 
could not bear it. As for the rest of the men, they were not 
mbject to me at all, and they knew it well enough ; so they 
.ook no notice of my dislike. 

The next day we' set sail, so we never heard any more of 
it. Our men differed in the account of the number they had 
killed ; but according to the best of their accounts, put alto- 
gether, they killed or destroyed about one hundred and fifty 
people, men, women and children, and left not a house standing 
in the town. As for the poor fellow Tom Jeffry, as he was 
quite dead (for his throat was so cut that his head was half 
off), it would do no service to bring him away ; so they only 
took him down from the tree, where he was hanging by one 
hand. 

However just our men thought this action, I was against 
them in it, and I always after that time told them God would 
blast the voyage ; for I looked upon all the blood they shed 
that night to be murder in them ; for though it is true thai 
they had killed Tom Jeffry, yet Jeffry was the aggressor, had 
broken the truce, and had violated or debauched a young 
womisn of theirs, who cameadown to them innocently, and 
on the faith of the public capitulation. 

The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were after- 
wards on board. He said it was true that we seemed to 
break the truce, but really had not ; and that tha war was 
begun the night before by the natives themselves, who had 
thot a' us, atd killed one of our men without any just pi >%«

ocatioa ; bo that as we were in a capacity to fight them now 
we mi^ht also be in a capacity to do ourselves justice upon 
them in an extraordinary manner ; that though the poor 
man had taken a little liberty with the wench, he ought not 
to have been murdered, and that in such a villanous manner ; 
and that they did nothing but what was just, and what the 
laws of God allowed to be done to murderers. 

One would think this should have been enough to have 
«'arned us against going on shore amongst heathens and bar* 
tiahans : but it is impossible to make mankind wise but at their 
own expense ; and their experience seems to be always of 
most use to them when it is dearest bought. 

We were now bound to the gulf of Persia, and from theno6 
to the coast of Coromandel, only to touch at Surat ; but the 
chief of the supercargo's design lay at the bay of Bengal ; 
where if he missed his business outward-bound, he was to 
go up to China, and return to the coast as he came home. 

The first disaster that befel us was in the gulf of Persia, 
where five of our men venturing on shore on the Arabian 
side of the gulf, were surrounded by the Arabians, and 
either all killed or carried away into slavery : the rest of the 
boat's crew were not able to rescue them, and had but just 
time to get ofi* their boat. I began to upbraid them with 
the just retribuiton of Heaven in this case ; but the boat^ 
twain very warmly told me, he thought I went farther in my 
V ensures than I could show any warrant for in Scripture ; 
and referred to Luke xiii. 4, where our Saviour intimate* 
that those men on whom Jtie tower of Siloam fell were not 
einners above all the Oalileansi; but that which put me to 
silence in the case was, that not one of these five men whr 
were now lost were of those who went on shore to the mas- 
nacre of Madagascar, so I always called it, though our men 
eould not bear to hear the word massacre witb any 
patience. 

But my freiiuent prpaching to them on the subject ha4

wc/rse consequences than I expected ; and the boats\^ain who 
had been the head of the attempt, came up boldly to me one 
time, and told me he found that I brought that affair con- 
tinually upon the stage : that I made unjust reflections upon 
it, and had used the men very ill on that account, and him- 
self in particular ; that 1 was but a passenger, and had no 
command in the ship, or concern in the voyage, they were 
n-Jt obliged to bear it ; that they did not know but I might 
have some ill design in my head, and perhaps to call them to 
an account for it when they came to England ; and that, 
therefore, unless I would resohre to have done with it, and 
also not to concern myself any farther with him, or any oi 
his affairs, he would leave the ship ; for he did not think it 
was safe to sail with me among them. 

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then 
told him, that I confessed I had all along opposed the mas- 
sacre of Madagascar, and that I had, on all occasions, spoken 
my mind freely about it, though not more u|on him than 
any of the rest ; tnat as to having no command in the ship, 
that was true : nor did I exercise any authority, only took 
the liberty of speaking my mind in things which publicly 
3oncerned us all ; and what concern I had in the voyage was 
none of his business ; that I was a considerable owner in 
^he ship ; in that claim, I had conceived I had a right to 
9peak even farther than 1 had done, and would not be ac- 
countable to him or any one else ; and began to be a little 
warm with him. He made but little reply to me at that 
time, and I thought the affair had been over. We were at 
this time in tne road at Bengal ; and being willing to see 
the place, 1 went on shore with the supercargo, in the ship's 
coat to divert myself; and towards evening was preparing to 
go on board, when one of the men came to me, and t Id me 
he would not have me trouble myself to come down to the 
boat, for they had orders not to carry me on board any more. 
Any one may guess what a surprise I was in at so insolent a

xnibmag$ ; and I asked the man who bade him dt liver Uiai 
message tc me ? He told me the cockswain. I said no more 
to the fellow, but bade him let them know he had deliverea 
his message, and that I had given him no answer to it. 

I immediately went and found out the supercargo, and 
taM him the story ; adding, which I presently foresaw, that 
there would be a mutiny in the ship ; and entreated him to 
go immediately on board the ship in an Indian boat, and 
Acquaint the captain of it. But I might have spared this 
intelligence, for before I had spoken to him on shore the mat- 
tcr was effected on board. The boatswain, the gunner, the 
carpenter, and all the inferior officers, as soon as I was gone 
off in the boat, came up, and desired to speak with the cap- 
tain ; and there the boatswain, making a long harangue, and 
iepeating all he had said to me, told the captain, in a few 
words, that I was now gone peaceably on shore, they were 
loath to use any violence with me, which, if I had not gone 
on shore, they would otherwise have done, to oblige me to 
nave gone ; they therefore thought fit to tell him, that as 
they shipped themselves to serve in the ship, under his 
command, they would perform it well and faithfully; but il 
1 would not quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to quit 
it, they would all leave the ship, and sail no farther with 
him ; and at that word all, he turned his face towards the 
mainmast, which was, it seems, the signal agreed on between 
them, at which all the seamen, being got together there, 
cried out. One and aU ! one and all ! 

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of great 
presence of mind ; and ahough he was surprised, you may 
be sure at the thing, yet he told them calmly that he would 
ei:nsider of the matter ; but that he could do nothmg in it 
till he had spoken to me about it. He used some arguments 
with them to show them the unreasonableness and injustice 
»i the thing : but it was all in vain ; they swore and shoolK 
«ands round before his face, that they would all go on shores

my more on board the ship. 

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obliga« 
tion to me, and did not know how I might take it : so hfl 
began to talk smartly to thorn ; told them that I was a veiy 
considerable *. wner of the ship, and that, in justice, he could 
not put me out of my own house ; that this was the next 
loor to serving me as the famous pirate Kidd had done, who 
made a mutiny in the ship, set t\f* captain on shore on an 
uninhabited island, and ran away vith the ship ; that let 
them go into what ship they woul(^, »f ever they came to 
England again it would cost them very dear ; that the ship 
was mine, and that he could not put me out of it ; and that he 
would rather lose the ship and the voya'^« too than disobligf» 
me so much; so they might do as the^^ n?eased : however 
he would go on shore and talk with me^ Mtd invited the 
boatswain to go with him, and perhaps thef m'ght accommo- 
date the matter with me. But they all rejected* the proposal 
and said they would have nothing to do with me sny more • 
and if I came on board, they would all go on sho'e. Well, 
said the captain, if you are all of this mind, let n*? go ov 
shore and talk with him. So away he came to me ^ \*h thir 
account, a little after the message had been brougl t to m( 
from the cockswain. 

I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confesf ; ^or ) 
was not without apprehensions that they would conf?v« hinD 
by violence, set sail, and run away with the ship ; and thev 
I had been stripped naked in a remote country, having noth- 
ing to help myself: in short I had been in a worse case th&r 
when I was alone in the island. But they had not come tc 
;hat length, it seems, to my satisfaction ; and when mf 
nephew told me what they had said to him, and how thej 
had sworn and shook hands that they would one and all

was no way to help it but to comply ; so, in short, he went 
on board the ship again, and satisfied the men that his uncle 
had yielded to their importunity, and had sent for his good*

1 WAS now alone in the most remote part of the world, as 1 
think 1 may call it, for I was near three thousand leagues by 
sea farther off* from England than I was at my island ; only, 
ft is true, I might travel here by land over the great Mogul's

up the gulf of Persia, and take the way of the caravans, 
ovei the Desert of Arabia, to Aleppo and Scanderoon ; from 
(hence by sea again to Italy, and so overland into France ; 
md this put together might at least be a full diameter of the

I had another way before me, which was to wait f(»r som« 
f^lish ships, which were coming to Bengal from Achin, m

^e island of Sumatra, and get passage on loaii them foi 
England. But as I came hither without any concern with 
the English East India Company, so it would he difficult to 
go from hence without their license, unless with great favoi 
of the captains of the ships, or the Company's factoi-s, and 
to both I was an utter stranger. 

Here I had the mortification to see the ship set sail with« 
out me ; a treatment I think a man in my circumstances 
scarce ever met with, except when pirates running away with 
the ship, and setting those that would not agree with theii 
villainy on shore. Indeed, this was next door to it, both 
ways ; however, my nephew left me two servants, or rather 
one companion and one servant ; the first was clerk to the 
purser, whom he engaged to go with me, and the other was 
his own servant. I took me also a good lodging in the 
house of an Englishwoman, where several merchants lodged, 
some French, two Italians, or rather Jews, and one Englbh- 
man ; here I was handsomely enough entertained : and that 
I might not be said to run rashly upon anything, I stayed 
here above nine months considering what course to take, and 
how to manage myself. I had some English goods with me 
of value, and a ronsiderable sum of money ; my nephew fur- 
nishing me with a thousand pieces of eight, and a letter ol 
credit for more, if I had occasion, that I might not be strait* 
ened, whatever might happen. 

I quickly disposed of my goods to advantage, and, as I 
driginallv intended, I bought here some very good diamonds, 
irhich, of all other things, were the most proper for me, in, 
my present circumstances ; because I could always carry my 
whol^ estate about me. 

After a long stay here, and many proposals made tin my 
return to England, none falling out to my mind, the Eng« 
lish merchant who lodged with me, and whom I had con 
;racted an intimate acquaintance with, came to me one mom* 
'mg. Countrymen, says he, I have a project to communicact

to you, which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, for an^ 
I know, suit with yours also, when you shall have tnoroughly 
considered it. Here we are posted, you by accident, and 1 
by my own choice, in a part of the world very remote firom 
•or own country ; but it is in a country where, by us who 
understand trade and business, a great deal of money is to 
be got. If you will put one thousand pounds to ray one 
thousand pounds, we will hire a ship here, the first we can 
get to our minds ; you shall be captain, FU be merchant, 
and we'll go a trading voyage to China : for what should we 
stand still for ? llie whole world is in motion, rolling round 
and round ; all the creatures of God, heavenly bodies and 
earthly, are busy and diligent: why should we be idle? 
There are no drones in the world but men ; why should we 
be of that number ? 

I liked this proposal very well, and the more because it 
seemed to be expressed with so much good will, and in so 
friendly a manner. I will not say but that I might, by my 
loose unhinged circumstances, be the fitter to embrace a pro* 
posal for trade, or indeed any thing else ; whereas, other* 
wise, trade was none of my element. However, I might 
perhaps say with some truth, that if trade was not my ele- 
ment, rambling was, and no proposal for seeing any part oi 
the world which I had never seen before could possibly come 
amiss to me. 

It was, however, some time before we could get a snip to 
our minds, and when we had got a vessel, it was not easy to 
.get English sailors; that is to say, so many as were necej- 
•ary to govern the voyage and manage the sailors which we 
should pick up there. After some time we got a niate, a 
boatswain, and a gunner, English ; a Dutch carpenter, and 
three foremastmen. With these we found we could do 
^ell enough, having Indian seamen, such as they were, tc 
iftake up. 

There are to many travellers who have wrote the histqij 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 534 

•f their voyages and travels this way, that it wcild Ifc veri 
httle diversion to any body to give a long account of the 
[ laces we went to, and the people who inhabit there : these 
things 1 leave to others, and refer the reader to those journal! 
and travels of Englishmen of which many I find are pub- 
lished and more promised every day ; it is enough fur me to 
tell you that we made this voyage to Achin, in the island 
of Sumatra, and from thence to Siam, where we exchanged 
lome of our wares for opium and some arrack ; the first a 
commodity which bears a great price among the Chinese, 
and which, at that time, was much wanted there. In a 
word, we went up to Suskan, made a very groat voyage, 
were eight months out, and returned to Bengal; and 1 was 
very well satisfied with my adventure. I observe that our 
people in England often admire how officers which the 
Company send into India, and the merchants which gen- 
erally stay there, get such very great estates as they do, and 
sometimes come home worth sixty or seventy thousand 
pounds at a time ; but it is no wonder, or at least we shall 
see so much farther into it, when we consider the innumer- 
able ports and places where they have a free commerce, that 
it will be none ; and much less will it be so when we con- 
«ider that at those places and ports where the English ships 
come, there is such great and constant demands for the 
growth of all other countries, that there is a certain vent 
for the returns, as well as a market abroad for the gocdf 
carried out. 

In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so m^eh 
money by my first adventure, and such an insight into :L« 
method of getting more, that had 1 been twenty years 
younger, I should have been tempted to have stayed here, 
and sought no farther for making any fortune : but what 
was all this to a man upwards of threescore, that was rich 
enough, and came abroad more in obedience to a restless 
lesird 1^ seeing the world than a covetous desire of gaining 



^36 ADVENTURES OF 

Dj it ? And, indeed, I think it is with great jostice k ik» 
tail it restless desire, for it was so. When I was at home, i 
was restless to go abroad ; and when I was abroad, I wa« 
restless to be at home. I say, what was this gain to me ? 1 
was rich enough already, nor had I any uneasy desires about 
G^etting more mcney ; and therefore the profit of the voyage 
to me was of no great force for the prompting me forward to 
faither undertakings ; hence I thought that by this voyage I 
Had made no progress at a}l, because I was come back, as I 
might call it, to the place from whence I came, as to home ; 
whereas my eye, which, like that which Solomon speaks of 
was never satisfied with seeing, was still dteirous of wander- 
ing and seeing more. I was come into a part of the world 
which I was never in before, and that part, in particular, 
;irhich I had heard much of, and was resolved to see as much 
jf it as I could ; and then I thought I might say I had seen 
all the world that was worth seeing. 

But my fWow traveller and I had different notions : I do 
not name this to innst on my own, for I acknowledge his 
were the most just, and the most suited to the end of a 
merchant's life ; who, when he is abroad upon adventures, it 
is his wisdom to stick to that, as the best thing for him, 
which he is like to get the most money by. My new 
friend kept himself to the nature of the thing, and would 
have been content to have gone like a carrier's horse, always 
to the same inn, backward and forward, provided he could, 
as he called it, find his account in it. On the other hand, 
mine was the notion of a mad rambling boy, that never lares 
to see a thing twice over. But this was not all ; I had a 
dnd of impatience upon me to be nearer home, and yet the 
most unsettled resolution imaginable which way to go. In 
the interval of these consultations, my friend, who wai 
always upon the search for business, proposed another voyags 
to me among the Spice Islands, and to bring home a loading 
•? oloveA fron the Manillas, or thereabouts ; places, indeed

irherc the Dutch trade, but islands belonging partly to th« 
Bpani&rds ; though we went not so far, but to some other 
where they have not the whole power, as they have at Bata 
via, Ceylon, &c. 

We were not long in preparing for this voyage ; the chief 
difficulty was in bringing me to come into it : however, at 
!%8t, nothing else offering, and finding that really stirring 
tbout and trading, the profit being so great, and, as I may 
say, certain, had more pleasure in it, and had more satisfac- 
tion to my mind, than sitting still, which, to me especially, 
was the unhappiest part of my life, I resolved on this 
voyage too, which we made very successfully, touching at 
Borneo, and several islands whose names I do not remember, 
and came home in about hve months. We sold our spice, 
which was chiefly cloves and some nutmegs, to the Persian 
merchants, who carried them away to* the gulf; and making 
near five of one, we really got a great deal of money. 

My Mend, when we made up this account, smiled at me : 
Well, now, said he, with a sort of agreeable insult upon 
my indolent temper, is not this better than walking about 
here, like a man of nothing to do, and spending our time 
in staring at the nonsense and ignorance of the Pagans ? — 
Why, truly, says I, my friend, I think it is, and I begin to 
be a convert to the principles of merchandising ; but I must 
tell you, said I, by the way, you do rot know what I am 
doing ; for if 1 once conquer my backwardness, and embark 
heartily, as old as I am, I shall harass you up and down 
the world till I tire you ; for I shall pursue it so eagerly. 
( shall never let vou lie still. 

But, to be short with my speculations, a littlt while aftei 
this there came in a Dutch ship from Batavia she was a

Deing willing, for other reasons, to go for Enrobe, he gatv 
public notice he would sell his ship. This came to my can 
before my new partner heard of it, and I had a great mind 
to buy it ; so I went to him, and told him of it. He con- 
■Idered awhile, for he was no rash man neither ; but musing 
•ome time, he replied. She is a little too big ; but, however, 
we will have her. Accordingly, we bought the ship, and 
agreeing with the master, we paid for her, and took posse?* 
•ion. When we had done so, we resolved to entertain the 
men, if we could, to join tnem with those we had, for the 
pursuing our business ; but on a sudden, they having re- v 
ceived, not their wages, but their share of the money, as we 
afterwards learned, not one of them was to be found ; we 
inquired much about them, and at length were told that 
they were all gone together by land to Agra, the great city 
of the Mogul's residefice, and from thence to travel to Surat, 
and go by sea to the gulf of Persia. 

Nothing had so much troubled me a good while as that I 
should miss the opportunity of going with them ; for such a 
ramble, I thought, and in such company as would both have 
g^uarded and diverted me, would have suited mightily with my 
great design : and I should have both seen the world and 
gone homewards too ; but I was much better satisfied a few 
days after, when I came to know what sort of fellows they 
were ; for, in short, their history was, that this man they 
called captain was the gunner only, not the commander ; 
that they had been a trading voyage, in which they had been 
attacked on shore by some of the Malays, who had killed the 
captain and three of his men ; and that after the captain was 
killed, these men, eleven in number, l«d resolved to run 
away with the ship, which they did, and brought her to 
Bengali, leaving the mate and five men more on shore ; o^ 
whom hereafter.

Diamine into things so exactly as we ought ; for we nevei 
inquired anything of the seamen, who would certiiinlj 
have faltered in their account, contradicted one another, and 
perhaps contradicted themselves ; or one how or other w« 
should have had reason to have suspected them: but the 
man showed us a bill of sale for the ship, to one EmauueJ 
Clostershoven, or some such name, for I suppose it was ail a 
forgery* and called himself by that name, and we could not 
contradict nim; and withal, having no suspicion of the thing, 
w^ went through with our bargain. 

We picked up some more English sailors here after this, 
and some Dutch ; and now we resolved for a second voyage 
to the south-east for cloves, &c. : that is to say, among the 
Philippine and Molucca isles ; and, in short, not to fill up 
this part of my story with trifles, when what is to come is so 
remarkable, I spent from first to last, six years in this coun- 
try, trading from port to port, backward and forward, and 
with very good success, and was now the last year with my 
new partner, going in the ship above mentioned, on a voyage 
*X) China, but designing first to Siara, to buy rice. 

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat 
up and down a great while in the straits of Malacca, and 
among the islands, we were no sooner got clear of those dif- 
3cult seas than we found our ship had sprung a leak, and 
we were not able, by all our industry, to find out where it 
was. This forced us to make some port ; and my partner, 
who knew the country better than 1 did, directed the captain 
to put into the river of Cambodia ; for I had made the Eng- 
lish mate, one Mr. Thompson, captain, not being willing tc 
take the charge of the ship upon myself. This river lies on 
the north side of the great bay or gulf which goes up to 
Siam. While we were here, and going often on shore for 
refreshment, ^there comes to me one day an Englishman, i\nd 
he was it seems, a gunner*8-mate on board an English Eaat 
(ndia ship which rode in th) same river, at of near the cit}

•f Cambodia; what brought him hither we knew not; la 
he comes to me, and speaking English, Sir, says he, you art 
a stranger to me, and I to you, but I have something to tell 
you that very nearly concerns you. 

I looked steadfastly at him a good while, and thought at 
^t I had known him, but I did not : If it very nearly con- 
eems me, said I, and not yourself, what moves you to tell it 
to me ? — I am moved, says he, by the imminent danger you 
are in, and for aught I see, you have no knowledge of it. *«• 
I know no danger I am in, says I, but that my ship b leaky, 
and I cannot find it out ; but I intend to lay her aground to- 
morrow, to see if I can find it. — But, sir, s^ys he, leaky or 
not leaky, find it or not find it, you wiU be wiser than to \ar 
your ship on shore to-morrow, when you hear what I have 
to say to you : do you know, sir, said he, the town of Cam- 
bodia lies about fifteen leagues up this river ? and there are 
two large English ships about five leagues on this side, and 
three Dutch. — Well, said I, and what is that to me ? — 
Why, sir, said he, is it for a man that is upon such adventures 
as you are* to come into a port and not examine first what ships 
there are there, and whether he is able to deal with them r 
I suf)pose you do not think you are a match for them ? I was 
amused very much at his discourse, but not amazed at it, for 
I could not conceive what he meant; and I turned short 
upon him, and said. Sir, I wish you would explain yourself; 
I cannot imagine what reason I have to be afraid of any ol 
the Company's ships, or Dutch ships ; I am no interloper ; 
what can they have to say to me ? He looked like a man 
half angr}' and half pleased, and pausing awhile, but smiling. 
Well, sir, says he, if you think yourself secure, you must take 
your chance ; I am sorry your fate should blind you against 
good advice : but assure yourself^ if you do not put to sea 
mmediately, you will the very next tide be attacked by five 
ongboats fuU of men, and perhaps, if you are taken, you 
vill be hango l for a pirate, and the particulars be examimrf

afterward?. I thouc^ht, sir added he, I should have met witb 
% better receptfon than this, for doing you a piece of service 
of such importance. — I can never be ungrateful, said I, foi 
any service, or to ar.y man that offers me any kindness : but 
!t is past my comprehension what they should have such 
a design upon me for : however, since you say there is no 
time to be lost, and that there is some villanous design on 
hand against me, I will go on board this minute, and put to 
sea immediately, if my men can stop the leak, or if we can 
iwim without stopping it : but, sir, said I, shall I go away 
ignorant of the cause of all this? Can you give me no 
further light into it ? — I can tell you but part of the story, 
sir, says he ; but I have a Ducth seaman here with me, and 
I believe I could persuade him, to tell you the rest ; but 
there is scarce time for it : but the short of the story is this, 
the first part of which, I suppose, you know well enough, 
viz., that you was with this ship at Sumatra ; that there 
your captain was murdered by the Malays, with three of his 
tnen ; and that you or some of those that were on board 
with you, ran away with the ship, and are since turned pi- 
rates. This is the sum of the story, and you will all be 
seized as pirates, I can assure you, and executed with very 
little ceremony; for you know merchant ships show but 
little law to pirates, if they get them into their power. — 
Now you speak plain English, said I, and I thank you ; and 
though I know nothing that we have done like what you 
talk of, for I am sure we came honestly and fairly by the 
•hip ; yet seeing such a work is doing, as you say, and that 
you seem to mean honestly, I will be upon my guard. — 
Nay, sir, says he, do not talk about being upon your guard ; 
the best defence is, to be out of the danger ; if you have 
any regard for your life, and the lives of all your men, put 
to sea, without fail, at high water ; and as you have a whole 
tide before you, you will be gone too far out before they can 
mmt down ; for they will come away at high water, and as 
4C 



542 ADVENTURES OP 

they have twenty miles to come, you will get near two he un 
of them by the difference of the tide, not reckoning the 
length c f the way ; besides, as they are only boats, and not 
ships, tLey will not venture to follow you far out to sea, 
especially if it blows. — Well, said I, yod have been very 
kind in this ; what shall 1 do for you to make you amends ? 
8ir, says he, you may not be willing to make me any amendb, 
because you may not be convinced of the truth of it : I will 
make an offer to you ; I have nineteen months' pay due to 
me on board the ship ***, which I came out of England in ; 
and the Dutchman that is with me had seven months^ pay 
done to him ; if you will make good our pay to us, we will go 
along with you : if you find nothing more in it, we will 
desire no more ; but if we do convince you that we have 
saved your lives, and the ship, and the lives of all the men 
in her, we will leave the rest to you. 

I consented to this readily, and went immediately on 
board, and the two men with me. As soon as I came to the 
ship's side, my partner, who was on board, came out on the 
quarter-deck, and called to me, with a great deal of joy, O 
ho ! O ho ! we have stopped the leak ! we have stopped the 
leak ! — Say you so ! said 1, thank God ; but weigh anchor 
then immediately. — Weigh ! says he : what do you mean 
by that ? What is the matter ? — Ask no questions, said 1 ; 
but all hands to work, and weigh without losing a minute. 
He was surprised, but, however, he called the captain, and 
he immediately ordered the anchor to be got up : and though 
the tide was not quite down, yet a little land breeze blow- 
ing, we stood out to sea. Then I called him into the cabin, 
and told him the story ; and we called in the men, and they 
told us the rest of it : but as it took up a great deal of time 
before we had done a seaman comes to the cabin door, and 
culled out to us that the captain bade him tell us we wera 
ehased. Chased I says I ; by what ? — By five sloops, oi 
boa*«, says the ^4 low, full of men. — Very well, said T ; thei 



KOBINSON CKUSOE. 549 

It is apparent there 18 something in it. In the ntxt place 1 
ordered all our men to be called up, and told them there wa# 
* design to seize the ship, and to take us for pirates, and 
asked them if they would stand by us, and by cne another : 
*iie men answered cheerfully, one and all, that they wculd 
live and die with us. Then I asked the captain what way 
h( thought best for us to manage a fight with them ; fci 
lesist them I was resolved we would, and that to the last 
drop. He said readily that the way was to keep them ofl 
with our great shot as long as we could, and then fire at 
them with our amall arms, to keep them from boarding us ; 
but when neither of these would do any longer, we should 
retire to our close quarters ; perhaps they had not materials 
to break open our bulk-heads, or get in upon us. 

The gunner had, in the mean time, orders to bring two 
guns to bear fore and aft, out of the steerage, to clear the 
deck, and load them with musket bullets and small pieces oi 
old iron, and what came next to hand ; and thus we made 
ready for fight : bnt all this while we kept out to sea, with 
wind enough, and could see the boats at a distance, being 
five large longboats, following us with all the sail they could 
make. 

Two of those boats (which by our glasses we could see 
were English) outsailed the rest, were near two leagues 
ahead of them, and gained upon us considerably, so that we 
found they would come up with us ; upon which we fired a 
gun without ball, to intimate that they should bring to ; and 
we put out a flag of truce, as a signal for parley ; but they 
came crowding after us, till they came within shot, when we 
took in our white flag, they having made no answer to it, 
and hung out a red flag, and fired at them with shot. Not- 
withstanding this, th^y came on till they were near enough 
to call to them witi a speaking-trumpet which we had on 
beard ; so we called to them, and bade them keep off, af. 
&eir peril. 



^4 ADYENTURBS OF 

It was all one ; they crowded after us, and endeavored ti 
•ope under our stern, so as to board us on our quarter ^ 
upon which, seeing they were resolute for mischief, and de- 
pended upon the strength that followed them, I ordered to 
bring the ship to, so that they lay upon our broadside ; wheD 
immediately we fired five guns at them, one of which had 
been levelled so true as to carry away the stem of the hin^- 
mnost boat, and bringing them to the necessity of taking 
down their sail, and running all to the head of the boat to 
keep her from sinking ; so she lay by^ and had enough of it 
but seeing the foremost boat crowd on after us, we made 
ready to fire at her in particular. While this Was doing, one 
of the three boats, that was behind, being forwarder than 
the other two, made up to the boat which we had disabled, 
to relieve her, and we could see her take out the men ; we 
called again to the foremost boat, and offered a truce, to 
parley again, and to know what her business was with us ; 
but had no answer, only she crowded close under our stem. 
Upon this our gunner, who was a very dexterous fellow, run 
9ut his two chase gims, and fired again at her, but the shot 
missing, the men in the boat shouted, waved their caps, and 
came on ; but the gunner, getting quickly ready again, fired 
among them a second time, one shot of which, though it 
missed the boat itself, yet fell in among the men, and we 
eould easily see had done a great deal of mischief among 
•hem ; but we took no notice of that, wore the ship again. 
And brought our quarter to bear upon them, and firing three 
guns more, we found the boat was almost split to pieoes ; in 
Dartioilar, her rudder and a piece of her stem was shot 
quile away ; so they handed her sail immediately, and were 
in great disorder. But to complete their misfortune, oui 
^vaner let fiy two guns at them again : where he hit them 
^e could not tell, but we found the boat was sinking, and 
jome of the men already in the water : upon this I immedi«

tonxd, aid save them from drowning, and iraniediately come 
on b^ard the ship with them, because we sav' the rest of th« 
boats began to come up. Our men in the pinnace followed 
their orders, and took up three men, one of whom was just 
drowning, and it was a good while before we could recovei 
him. As soon as they were on board, we crowded all the 
iail we could make, and stood farther out to sea ; and we found 
. that when the other three boats came up to the first, thej 
gave o'*er their chase. 

Being thus delivered from a danger, which, though I knew 
not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater than I 
apprehended, I resolved that we should change our course, 
and not let any one know whither we were going : so we 
stood out to sea eastward, quite out of the course of all Eu- 
ropean ships, whether they were bound to China or any 
where else within the commerce of the European nations. 

When we were at sea, we began to consult with the two 
seamen, and inquire what the meaning of all this should be ; 
and the Dutchman let us into the secret at once, telling uf 
that the fellow that sold us the ship, as we said, was no 
more than a thief that had run away with her. Then he 
told us how the captain, whose name too he told us, thougl 
I do not remember it now, was treacherously murdered by 
the natives on the coast of Mauacca, with three of his men ; 
and that he, this Dutchman, and four more, got into the 
woods, where they wandered about a great while, till at 
length he, in particular, in a miraculous manner, made his 
escape, and swam off to a Dutch ship, which, sailing near 
the shore in its way from China, had sent their boat on shore 
for fresh water ; that he durst not come to that part of the 
shore where the boat was, but made shift in the night to take 
the water farther off, and swimming a great while, at last 
<the ship's boat took him up. 

He then told us that he went to Batavia, where f wo of Qti

•eaiv««»«^ belonging to the 8hip arrived, having deserted tlM 
rest in their travels, and gave an account that the fellow who 
nad run away with the ship sold her at Bengal to a set oi 
pirates, which were gone a cruising in her ; and that they 
nad 'already taken an English ship and two Dutch ships verj 
richly laden. 

This latter part was found to concern us directly, though 
«re kn«*w it to be false ; yet as my partner said very justly, 
if we uj'l fallen into their hands, and they had had such s 
prepossess against us before hand, it had been in vain foi 
OS to have attended ourselves, or to hope for any good quar- 
ter at their hands ; and especially considering that oui 
accusers had been our judges, and that we could have ex* 
pected nothing from them but what rage would have dictated, 
and an ungovemed passion have executed : and therefore it 
was his opinion we should go directly back to Bengal, from 
whence we came, without putting in at any port whatever ; 
because there we could give a good account of ourselves, 
could prove where we were when the ship put in, of whom 
we bought her, and the like ; and which was more than all 
th^ rest, if we were put upon the necessity of bringing it be- 
fore the proper judges, we should be sure to have some 
|ustice, and not to be hanged first and judged afterwards. 

I was some time of my partner's opinion ; but after a little 
more serious thinking, I told him I thought it was a very 
great hazard for us to attempt returning to Bengal, for that 
^we were on the wrong side of the Straits of Malacca, and 
that if the alarm was given, we should be sure to be waylaid 
on every side, as well by the Dutch of Batavia as the Eng- 
lish elsewhere ; that if we should be taken, as it were, run- 
ning away, we should even condemn ourselves, and there 
would want no more evidence to destroy us. I also asked 
the English sailor's opinion, who said he was of my mind, 
and that we should certainly be taken. This danger a littli 
•<artled my partner, and all thr ship's company, and we in

medialo'.y resolved to go away to the coabt of Tonquin, and 
BO on to the coast of China ; and pursuing the firEt lesigv 
M to trade, find some way or other to dispose of the sLip^ 
and come hack in some of the vessels of the country, such 
as we could get. 'This was approved of as the hest method 
for our security ; and accordingly we steered away N.N.E., 
keeping ahove fifty leagues off from the usual course to the 
eastward. This, however, put us to some inconvenience ; for, 
first, the winds, when we came to that distance from the 
shore, seemed to be more steadily against us, blowing almost 
trade, as we call it, from the E. and E.N.E., so that we 
were a long while upon our voyage, and we were but ill pro- 
vided with victuals for so long a run ; and, which was still 
worse, there was some danger that those English and Dutch 
ships, whose boats pursued us, whereof some were bound 
that way, might be got in before us, and if not, some other 
ship bound to China might have information of us from 
them, and pursue us with the same vigor. 

I must confess, 1 was now very uneasy, and thought my- 
self, including the late escape from the longboats, to have 
been in the most dangerous condition that ever I was 
through my past life ; for whatever ill circumstances I had 
been in, I was never pursued for a thief before ; nor had I 
ever done anything that merited the name of dishonest oi 
fraudulent, much less thievish ; I had chiefly been my own 
enemy, or, as I may rightly say, I had been nobody's enemy 
but my own ; but now I was embarrassed in the worst con- 
dition imaginable ; for though I was perfectly innocent, 1 
was in no condition to make that innocence appear ; and if I 
had been taken, it had been under a supposed guilt of the 
worst kind.. This made me very anxious to make an escape, 
though which way to do it I knew not, or what port or place 
we could go to. My partner seeing me thus dejected, 
though he was the most concerned at first, began to encour^ 
%ge me, and describing to me the several portf of that coas^

iold me he wool! put in on the coast of Conhm China, M 
the bay of Tonquin, intending to go afterwards to Macao, a 
town once in possession of the Portugese, and where still a 
great many European fiimilies resided ; and particularly the 
missionary priests usually went thither, in order to thei^ 
going forward to China. 

Hither then we resolved to go ; and accordingly, though 
after a tedious and irregular course, and very much strait- 
ened for provisions, we came within sight of the coast very 
early in the morning ; and upon reflection on the past cir* 
cumstancea we were in, and the danger if we had not 
escaped, we reaolved to put into a small river, which, how- 
ever, had depth enough of water for us, and to see if we 
could, either overland or by the ship's pinnace, come to 
know what ships were in any port thereabouts. This happy 
step was, indeed, our deliverance ; for though we did not 
immediately see any European ships in the bay of Tonquin* 
yet the next morning there came into the bay two Dutch 
ships; and the third, ^thout any colors spread out, but 
which we believed to be a Dutchman, passed by at about 
two leagues' distance, steering for the coast of China ; and 
in the afternoon went by two English ships steering the same 
course ; and thus we thought we saw ourselves beset with 
enemies both one way and the other. The place we were 
in was wild and barbarous ; the people theives, even by 
occupation or profession ; and though, it is true, we had not 
much to seek of them, and, except getting a few provisional 
eared not how little we had to do with them, yet it was with 
much difficulty that we kept ourselves from being insulted 
by them, several ways. We were in a small river of this 
eonntry, within a few leagues of its utmost limits north- 
ward ; and by our boat we coasted north*east, to the point oi 
Und which opens the great bay of Tonquin ; and it was in 
this beating up along the shore that we discovered we were 
norouDded with enemies. The people we were amopg wars 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 5iy 

ihe most barbarous of all the inhabitants of the coa:^t, :iaT- 
ing DO correspondence with any other nation, and dealing 
only in fish and oil, and such gross commodities ; and it may 
be particularly seen that they are the most barbarous«of any 
of the inhabitants. Among other customs, they have thir 
one, viz., that if any vessel has the misfortune to be ship 
wrecked upon their coast, they presently make the men all 
prisoners or slaves ; and it was not long before we found a 
piece of ihoir kindness this way, on the occasion following. 

I have observed above, that our ship sprung a leak at sea, 
and that we could not find it out ; and it happened that, as 
I have said, it was stopped unexpectedly in the happy minute 
of our being to be seized by the Dutch and English ships in 
the bay of Siam ; yet as we did not find the ship so perfectly 
tight and sound as we desired, we resolved, while we were at 
this place, to lay her on shore, and take out what heavy 
things we had on board, and clean her bottom ; and, if pos- 
sible, to find out where the leaks were. Accordingly, having 
lightened the ship, and brought all our guns and other move- 
ables to on6 side, we tried to bring her down, that we might 
come at her bottom ; but, on second thoughts, we did not 
care to lay her on dry ground, neither could we find a proper 
place for it. 

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with 
such a sight, came wandering down the shore to look at us ; 
and seeing the ship lie down on one side in such a manner, 
and heeling in towards the shore, and not seeing our men, 
who were at work on her bottom with stages, and with theit 
boats, on the off-side, they presently concluded that the 
ihip was cast away, and lay so fast on the ground. On thii 
supposition, they all came about us in two or three hours' 
time, with ten or twelve large boats, having some of them 
eight, some ten men in a boat, intending, no doubt, to have 
e( me on board and plundered the ship ; and if they had 
fcand us there, to have carried us away for slaves tc* t^ieif

king, or i^hatever they call him, for we knew BDtlur.g oi 
their governor. 

When they came up to the ship and began to row round 
her, they discovered us all hard at work on the outside ol 
the ship's bottonf and side, washing, and graving, and stop- 
ping, as every seafaring man knows how. Th^y stood for a 
while gazing at us, and we who were a little surprised, could 
not imagine what their design was ; but being willing to be 
lure, we took this opportunity to get some of us into the 
ship, and others to hand down arms and ammunition to those 
that were at work to defend themselves with, if there should 
be occasion ; and it was no more than need : for in less 
than a quarter of an hour's consultation, they agreed, it 
seems, that the ship was really a wreck ; and that we were 
all at work endeavoring to save her, or to save our lives by 
the help of our boats ; and when we handed our arms into 
the boats, they concluded, by that motion, that we were 
endeavoring to save some of our goods; upon this they 
took it for granted we all belonged to them, and away they 
came directly upon our men, as if it had been in a line ol 
battle. 

Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be frightened, 
for we lay but in an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us 
to know NVhat they she ild do. I immediately called to the 
men that worked upr.n the stages, to slip them down, and 
get up the side into the ship ; and bade those in the boat to 
row round, and- come on board ; and those few of us who 
were on board worked with all the strength and Jhands w» 
had, to bring the ship to rights ; but, however, neither th^ 
men upon the stages nor those in the boats could do aa 
Ihey were ordered, before the Cochin Chinese were upon 
them; and two of their boats boarded our longboat, and

The first man they, laid hold on was an English seaman, a 
I'out, strong fellow, who. having a musket iu hia ha^

WBveT offered to fire it, but laid it down in tne boat . like a 
fool, as I thodght; but he understood his business bettef 
than I could teach him, for he grappled the pagan, and 
dragged him by main force out of their boat into ours, where 
taking him by the ears, he beat his head so against the boat*a 
gunnel, that the fellow died in his hands ; and, in the meai 
time, a Dutchman, who stood next, took up the musket, and 
with the butt-end of it so laid about him, that he knocked 
iown five of them who attempted to enter the boat. But 
this was doing little towards resisting thirty or forty men, 
who fearless, because ignorant of their danger, began to 
throw themselves into the longboat, where we had but five 
men in all to defend it ; but the following accident, which 
deserved our laughter, gave our men a complete victory. 

Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of the 
ship, as well as to pay the seams where he had calked her to 
stop the leaks, had got two kettles just let down into the 
boat, one filled with boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, 
tallow, and oil, and such stuff as the shipwrights use for that 
work ; and the man that attended the carpenter had a great 
iron ladle in his hand, with which he supplied the men thai 
were a^ work with the hot stuff : two of the enemy's men en- 
tered the boat just where this fellow stood, being in the fore- 
sheets ; he immediately saluted them with a ladleful of the 
stuff, boiling hot, which so burned and scalded them, being 
half naked, that they roared out like bulls, and enraged 
with the fire, leaped both into the sea. The carpenter saw 
it, and cried out. Well done Jack I give them some more of 
it : and stepping forward himself, takes one of the mops, &nd 
dipping it in the pitch-pot, he and his man threw it among 
them so plentifully, that, in short, of all the men in the three 
boats there was not one that escaped being scalded and 
burned with it, in a most frightful, pitiful manner, and made 
such a howling and crying, that I never heard a worse nois& • 
trr it is worth )bserving, that though pain naturally 1 mkei

all people cry out, yet eyery nation Uas a particular way ni 
exclamation, and makes noises as different from one anotniei 
as their speech. I cannot give the noise those creature mads 
a better name than howling, nor a name more proper to the 
tone of it ; for I never heard anything more like the noise oi 
the wolves, which, as I have said, I heard howl in the f6i« 
test on the frontiers of Languedoc. 

I was never better pleased with a victory in my life ; not 
^only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and that our danger 
was imminent before, but, aa we got this victory without any 
bloodshed, except of that man the fellow killed with his 
naked hands, and which I was very much concerned at, for I 
was sick of killing such poor savage wretches, even though 
it was in my own defence, knowing they came on errands 
which they thought just and knew no better ; and that 
though it may be a just thing, because necessary (for there 
is no necessary wickedness in nature), yet I thought it was a 
sad life, when we must be always obliged to be killing our 
fellow-creatures to preserve ourselves ; and, indeed, I think 
so still, and I would even now suffer a great deal, radier 
than I would take away the life even of the worst person 
injuring me ; and I believe all considering people whc^know 
the value of life would be of my opinion, if they entered 
seriously into the consideration of it. ' 

But to return to my story; — All the while this was 
doing, my partner and I, who managed the rest of the men 
on board, had with great dexterity brought the ship ahnos^. 
to rights, and having got the guns into their places again, 
the gunnejr called to me to bid our boat get out of the way, 
for he would let fly among them. I called back again to 
him, and Ind him not offer to fire, for the carpenter would 
do the work without him ; but bid him heat another pitch- 
kettle, which our cook, who was on board, took care of: 
out the enemy was so terrified with what they had met witii 
'n their first attack, that they would not come * on again ,

tJkii tfome of tbcm who were farthest off, seeing the shup 
swim, as it wert upright, began, as we suppose, to see theii 
mistake, and give over the enterprise, finding it was not as 
• they expected. Thus we got clear of this merry fight, and 
having got some rice, and some roots and bread, with about 
eixteen hogs, on board, two days before, we resolved to stay 
here no longer, but go forward, whatever came of it ; for we 
made no doubt but we should be surrounded the next day 
with rogues enough, perhaps more than our pitch-kettle 
would dispose of for us. We therefore got all our things on 
board the same evening, and the next morning were ready 
to sail : in the mean time, lying at anchor at some distance 
from the shore, we were not so much concerned, being now 
in a fighting posture, as well as in a sailing posture, if any 
enemy had presented. The next day, having finished our 
work within board, and finding our shiji was perfectly healed 
of all her leaks, we set sail. We would have gone into the 
bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to inform ourselves of what 
was to be known concerning the Dutch ships that had been 
there ; but we durst not stand in there, because we had seen 
several ships go in, as we supposed, but a little before ; so 
we kept on N.E. towards the island of Formosa, as much 
afraid of being seen by a Dutch or English merchant ship, 
as a Dutch or English merchant ship in the Mediterranean ia 
of an Algerine man-of-war. 

When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N.E. as if we 
would go to the Manillas or the Philippine islands, and thi« 
we did that we might not fall into the way of any of the 
& 'opean ships ; and then we steered north, till we came to 
tiw latitude of 22 deg. 30 min., by which means we made 
*he island Formosa directly, where we came to an anchor, in 
I rder to get water and fresh provisions, which the people 
there, who were very courteous and civil in their manners, 
supplied us with willingly, and dealt very fairly and punctu* 
ally with us in all their agreements and bargains, which if

what We did not find among other people, and may be owiui 
to the remains of Christianity which was once planted hers 
by a Dutch missionary of Protestants, and is a testimony 
•f what I have often observed, viz., that the Christian 
religion always civilizes the people and reforms their manr 
ners, where it is received, whether it works saving efifecti 
Qpon them or no. 

From thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast oi 
China at an equal distance, till we knew we were beyond al^ 
the ports of China where our European ships usually come ; 
being resolved, if possible, not to fall into any of their hands, 
especially in this country ; where, as our circumstances were, 
we coiild not fail of being entirely ruined. 

Being now come to the latitude of thirty degrees, we 
resolved to put into the first trading' port we should come at ; 
%nd standing in for the shore, a boat came off two leagues to us, 
with an old Portuguese pilot on board, who knowing us to be 
%n European ship, came to offer his sendee, which, indeed, 
we were glad of^ and took him on board ; upon which, with- 
out asking us whither we would go, he dismissed the boat 
he came in, and sent it back. 

1 thought it was now so much in our choice to make the 
old man carry us whither we would, that I began to talk to 
him about carrying us to the gulf of Nanquin, which is the 
most northern part of the coast of China. The old man 
laid he knew the gulf of Nanquin very well, but smiling, 
asked us what we would do there ^ I told him we would 
lell our cargo and purchase China wares, calicoes, raw silks, 
tea, wrought silks, 6lc., and so would return 'by the same 
oourse we came. He told us our best port had been to 
have put in at Macao, where we could not have failed of a 
market for our opium to our satis£u;tion. and might for our 
money have purchased all sorts of China goods as cheap as 
we could at Nanquin. 

N^t being able ta put the old man out of his talk, oi 



EOBINSON CRUSOE. 551 

«rhich h«i was very opinionated or conceited, 1 told tim w« 
were gentlemen as well as merchants, and that we had a 
mind to go and see the great city of Peking, and the famoui 
court of the monarch of China. Why then, siys the old 
man, you should go to Ningpo, where, by the river which 
mns into the sea there, you may go up within ^ve leagues 
of tlie ^roat canal. This canal is a navigable stream, which 
^oes through the heart of that vast empire of China, crosses 
all the rivers, passes some considerable hills by the help of 
sluices and gates, and goes up to the city of Peking, being 
in length near two hundred and seventy leagues. 

Well, said I, Senhor Portuguese, but that is not our 
business now ; the great question is, if you can carry us up 
to the city of Nanquin, from whence we can travel to Peking 
afterwards ? He said he could do so very well, and that 
there was a great Dutch ship gone up that way just before. 
This gave me a little shock, for a Dutch ship was now oui 
terror, and we had much rather have met the devil, at least 
if he had not come in too frightful a figure ; and we 
depended upon it that a Dutch ship would be our destruc- 
tion, for we were in no condition to fight them ; all the 
ships they trade with into those parts being of great bur- 
den, and of much greater force than we were. 

The old man found me a little confused, and under some 
concern, when he named a Dutch ship ; and said to me, Sir, 
you need be under no apprehensions of the Dutch ; I sup* 
pose they are not now at war with your nation ! — No, said 
I, that's true ; but I know not what liberties men may take 
when they are out of the reach of the laws of their own 
country. — Why, says he, you are no pirates ; what need 
you fear ? They will not meddle with peaceable merchants, 
lure. 

It I had any blood in my body that did not fly up into 
my face at that word, it was hindc»-oJ by sc*nc stop in the 
V '4scb appointed by nature to circulate it, for it put nil 



100 ADVENTURES OF 

Into the greatest dborder and confusion imaginable; not 
was it possible for me to conceal it so, but the oid^maa 
easily perceived it. 

Sir, says he, I find you are in some disorder In yonl 
thoughts at my talk ; pray be pleased to go which way yov 
think fit, and, depend upon it, 1*11 do you all the service I 
can. — Why, senhor, said I, it is true, I am a little unsettled 
iii my resolution at this time, whither to go in particular ; 
and I am something more so for what you said about pirates. 
I hope there are no pirates in these seas ; we are but in an 
ill condition to meet with them, for you see we have 
but a small force, and are but very weakly manned. — O, 
sir, says he, donH be concerned, I do not know that there 
have been any pirates in these seas these fifteen years, ex- 
cept one, which was seen, as I hear, in the bay of Siam, 
about a month since ; but you may be assured she is gone to 
the southward ; nor was she a ship of any great force, or fit 
for the work : she was not built for a privateer, but was run 
away with by a reprobate crew that was on board, after the 
captain and some of his men had been murdered by the Ma- 
layans, at or near the island of Sumatra. — What ! said I« 
seeming to know nothing of the matter, did they murder the 
captain ? — No, said he, I don't understand that they mur- 
dered him ; but as they afterwards ran away with the ship, it 
is generally belieyed that they betrayed him into the handd oi 
the Malayans, who did murder him ; and perhaps they procured 
them to do it. — Why then, said I, they deserve death as 
if they had done it themselves. — Nay, sayS the old man, 
they do deserve it ; and they will certainly have it, if they 
light upon any English or Dutch ship; for they have all 
agreed together, that if they meet that rogue they'll give 
him no quarter. — But, said I to him, you say the pirate if 
gone out of these seas ; how can they meet with him then ? 
— Why, that's true, says he, they do say so ; but he was. at 
f tell you in the bay of Siam, in the river Cambodia ; and

m%M discovered there by some Dutchmen who belonged to 
the ship, and who were left on shore when they ran awa 
with her ; and some English and Dutch traders being in tL« 
river, they were within a little of taking him : nay, said he, 
if the foremost boats had been well seconded by the rest, 
they had certainly taken him ; but he, finding only two Icati 
within reach of him, tacked about, and fired at those two, 
and ^^isabled them before the others came up, and then stand- 
ing off to sea, the others were not able to follow, and so he 
got away ; but they have all so exact a description of the 
ship, that they will be sure to know her ; and wherever they 
find her they have vowed to give no quarter either to the 
captain or seamen, but to hang them all up at the yard-arm. 
—What! said I, will they execute them right or wrong; 
hang them first, and judge them afterwards? — sir, says 
the old pilot, there is no need to make a formal business of 
it with such rogues as those; let them tie them back to 
back, and set them a diving, 'tis no more than they 
deserve. 

I knew I had my old man fast on board, and that he could 
do no harm, so that I turned short upon him : Well now, 
senhor, said I, this is the very reason why I would have you 
carry us up to Nanquin, and not put back to Macao, or to 
any other part of the country where the English or Dutch 
ships come ; for be it known to you, senhor, those captains 
of the English and Dutch ships are a parcel of rash, proud, 
insolent fellows, that neither know what belongs to justice, 
nor how to behave themselves as the laws of God and nature 
direct ; but being proud of their offices, and not understand- 
ing their power, they would act the murderers to punish 
robbers ; would take upon them to insult men falsely 
accused, and determine them guilty without due inquiry : 
and perhaps I may live to bring some of them to account foi 
*t, when they may be taught how justice is to be executed ; 
ftnd thai no man ought to be treated as a criminal till

lome lencc may be had of the crime, and that he ii tht 
man. 

With this I told him that this was £he very ship they 
attacked, and gave him a full account of the skirmish wf; had 
with their boats, and how foolishly and cowardly they be* 
haved. I told him all the story of our buying the ship, and 
how the Dutchman served us. I told hira the reasons I had 
to believe the story of killing the master by the Malayans 
was true, as also the running away with the ship ; but it was 
all a fiction of their own to suggest that the men had turned 
pirates, and they ought to have been sure it was so before 
they had ventured to attack us by surprise, and oblige us to 
resist them; adding, that they would have the blood of 
those men, whom we killed there in just defence, to answer 
for. 

The old man was amassed at this relation, and told us we 
were very much in the right to go away to the north ; and 
that if he might advise us, it should be to sell the ship in 
China, which we might very well do, and buy or build an- 
other in the country ; and, said he, though you will not get 
BO good a ship, yet you may get one able enough to carry 
you and all your goods back to Bengal, or any where else. 
I told him I would take his advice when I came to any port 
where I could find a ship for my turn, or get any custome* 
u> buy this. He replied, I should meet with customers 
enough for the ship at Nanquin, and that a Chinese junk 
would serve me very well to go back again ; and that he 
would procure me people both to buy one and sell the other. 
Well but, senhor, said I, as you say they know the ship sc 
well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your measures, be instru* 
mental to bring some honest innocent men into a terrible 
broil, and perhaps to be murdered in cold blood ; for wher- 
ever they find the ship, they will prove the guilt upon thf 
men, by proving this was the ship, and so innocent men may 
piobably be overpowered and murdered. — Why, says thi

Md maa, 1*11 find out a way to prevent that also ; fct a? I 
know all those commanders you speac of very well, and 
fhall see them all as they pass by, I will be f ure to set 
them to rights in the thing, and let them know that 
they had been so much in the wrong ; that though the 
people who were on board at first might run away with the 
ship, yet it was not true that they had turned pirates ; and 
that, in particular, these were not the men that first went ofl 
with the ship, but innocently bought her for the trade ; and 
I am persuaded they will so far believe me, as at least to act 
more cautiously for the time to come. 

While these things were passing between us, by way of 
discourse, we went forward directly for Nanquin, and in 
about thirteen days* sail came to an anchor at the south-west 
point of the great gulf of Nanquin ; where, by the way, I 
came by accident to understand that two Dutch ships were 
gone the length before me, and that I should certainly fall 
into their hands. I consulted my partner again in this exi- 
gency, and he was as much at a loss as I was, and would 
/cry gladly have been safe on shore almost any where : how- 
ever, I was not in such perplexity neither, but I asked the 
old pilot if there was no creek or harbor which I might put 
into and pursue my business with the Chinese privately, and 
be in no danger of the enemy. He told me, if I would sail 
to the southward about forty-two leagues, there was a little 
port called Quinchang, where the fathers of the mission 
usually landed from Macao, on their progress to teach the 
Christian religion to the Chinese, and where no European 
ships ever put in ; and if I thought to put in there, I mrgM 
consider what further course to take when I was on shore 
He confessed, he said, it was not a place for merchants 
wcept that at some certain times they had a kind of a fair 
^lere, when the merchants from Japan came over thither tc 
^y the Chinese merchandizes. 

We all agreed to go back to this place ; the name of t w

port, as he called it, I may perhaps spell wrong, fc r 1 ^o v»4 
particularly rememher it, having lost this, together with th« 
names of many other plaees set down in a little pocket* 
book, which was spoiled by the water by an accident ; but 
this I remember, that the Chinese or Japanese merchants we 
corresponded with called it by^ a different name from that 
which our Portuguese pilot gave it, and pronounced it at 
above, Quinchang. 

As we were unanimous in our resolution to go to this 
.place, we weighed the next day, having only gone twice on 
shore where we were to get fresh water ; on both which oc- 
casions the people of the country were very civil to us, and 
brought us abundance of things to sell to us, I mean of pro- 
visions, plants, roots, tea, rice, and some fowls, but nothing 
^thout money* 

We came to the other port (the wind being contrary) not 
till five days, but it was very much to our satisfaction ; and 
I was joyful, and I may say thankful, when I set my foot 
on shore, resolving, and my partner too, that if it was pos- 
sible to dispone of ourselves and effects any other way, 
though not every way to our satisfaction, we would never set 
one foot on board that unhappy vessel more ; and, indeed, 1 
must acknowledge, that of all the circumstances of life that 
ever I had any experience of, nothing makes mankind so 
completely miserable as that of being in constant fear. 
Well does the Scripture say, ** The fear of man brings c 
snare ;" it is a life of death, and the mind is so entirety op- 
pressed by it, that it is capable of no relief. 

Nor did it fidl <^ its usual operations upon the far cy, by 
heightening every danger, representing the English and 
Dutch captains to be men incapable of hearing reason, or ol 
distinguishing between honest men and rogues ; or between 
a story calculated for our own turn, made out of nothing, on 
purpose to deceive, and a true genuine account of our whole 
royagv, progress, and design ; for we might many ways hars 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 55', 

tonvineed any reasonable creature that we were not pi rates ; 
tihe goods we had on board, the course we steered, oui 
firankly showing ourselves, and entering into such and such 
ports ; and even our very manner, the force we had, the 
number of men, the few arms, little ammunition, short pro- 
^iaions ; all these would have served to convince any men 
that we were no pirates. The opium and other goods we 
had on board would make it appear the ship had been at 
Bengal. The Dutchmen, who, it was said, had the names 
of all the men that were in the ship, might easily see that we' 
were a mixture of English, Portuguese, and Indians, and 
but two Dutchmen on board. These, and many other par- 
ticular circumstances, might have made it evident to the un- 
derstanding of any commander, whose hands we might fall 
into, that we were no pirates. But fear, that blind, useless 
passion, worked another way, and threw us into the vapors ; 
it bewildered our understandings, and set the imagination at 
work to form a thousand terrible things that perhaps might 
never happen. We first supposed, as indeed every body else 
had related to us, that the seamen on board the English and 
Dutch ships, but especially the Dutch, were so enraged at 
the name of a pirate, and especially at our beating off their 
boats and escaping, that they would not give themselves 
leave to inquire whether we were pirates or no ; but would 
execute us off-hand, as we call it, without giving us any 
room for a defence. We reflected that there really was so 
much apparent evidence before them, that they would scarce 
inquire after any more ; as, first, that the ship was certainly 
the same, and that some of the seamen among them knew 
her, and had been on board her ; and, secondly, that when 
we had intelligence at the river of Cambodia that they were 
coming down to examine us, we fought their boats and fled ; 
•o that we made no doubt but they were as fully satisfied ol 
>ur being pirates, as we were satisfied of the contrary ; and

have taken those circumstances for evi lenee, i£ the tablet 
were turned, and my case was theirs ; and have made n« 
scruple of cutting all the crew to pieces, without belienng, 
or perhaps considering, what they might have to offer in 
their defence. 

But let that be how it will, these were oar apprehensions : 
and bo tit my partner and I scarce slept a night without 
dreaming of halters and yard-arms, that is to say, gibbets; 
of fighting, and being taken ; of killing, and being killed : 
and one night I was in such a fury in my dream, fancying 
the Dutchmen had boarded us, and I was knocking one of 
their seamen down, that I struck my doubled fist against the 
Me of the cabin I lay in, wi^h such a force, as wounded my 
hand grievously, broke my knuckles, and cut and bruised the 
flesh, so that it awaked me out of my sleep. 

Another apprehension I had was, the cruel usage we might 
meet with from them if we fell into their hands : then the 
fttory of Amboyna came into my head, and how the Dutch 
might perhaps torture us, as they did our countrymen there, 
and make some of our men, by extremity of torture, confess 
those crimes they never were guilty of, or own themselves 
and all of us to be pirates, and so they would put us to 
death with a formal appearance of justice ; and that they 
might be tempted to do this for the gain of our ship and 
cargo, which was worth four or five thousand pounds, put all 
together. 

These things tormented me and my partner too, night and 
day ; nor did we consider that the captains of ships have nc 
anthority to act thus ; and if we had surrendered prisonert 
to them, they could not answer the destroying us, or tor* 
iuring us, but would be accountable for it when they came 
to their own country ; this, I say, gave me no satisfaction ; 
for if they were to act thus ^th us, w*:iat advantage would 
H be to y 8 that they should be called to an account for it 7 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 561 

Mr it ^e were first to be murdered, what satisfaction fvould 
it be to us to have them punished when tliey came home ? 

I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections I no^ 
had upon the vast variety of my particular circumstances ; 
how hard 1 thought it was, that I, who had spent forty yean 
in a life of continual difficulties, and was at last come, as it 
were, to the port or haven which all men drive at, viz., to 
4kave rest and plenty, should be a volunteer in new sorrowt 
by my own unhappy choice ; and that I, who had escaped 
so many dangers in my youth, should now come to be 
hanged in my old age, and in so remote a place, for a crime 
which I was not in the least inclined to, much less guilty 
of. 

After these thoughts, something of religion would come 
in; and I would be considering that this seemed to me to 
be a disposition of immediate Providence, and I ought to 
look upon it and submit to it as such ; that although I was 
innocent as to men, I was far from being innocent as to my 
Maker ; and 1 ought to look in and examine what other 
:rimes in my life were most obvious to me, and for which 
Providence might justly inflict this punishment as a retribu- 
tion ; and that 1 ought to submit to this, just as I would to 
a shipwreck, if it had pleased God to have brought such a 
disaster upon me. 

In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take its 
place, and then 1 would be talking myself up to vigorous 
resolutions ; that I would not be taken to be barbarously 
used by a parcel of merciless wretches in cold blood ; that 
it were much better to have fallen into the hands of the 
savages, though I was sure they would feast upon me ^hr n 
they had taken me, than those who would perhajs glut theii 
rage upon me by inhuman tortures and barbarities ; that Id 
the case of the savages I always resolved to die fighting tq 
die last gasp, and why should I not do so npw, eeeing v

was m ich more dreadful, to nm at least, to think of fitUmi 
into these men'fr hands, than ever it was to think of being 
eaten by men ? for the savages, give them their due, would 
not eat a man till he was killed and dead, but that these 
men had many arts beyond the cruelty of death. When- 
ever these thoughts prevailed, I was sure to put myself* into 
a kind of fever with the agitation of a supposed fight ; my 
olood would boil, and my eyes sparkle, as if I was engaged, 
and I always resolved to take no quarter at their hands ; 
but, even at last, if I could resist no longer, I would blow 
ap the ship and all that was in her, and leave them but little 
booty to boast of. 

The greater weight the anxieties and perplexities of these 
things were to our thoughts while we were at sea, the greatex 
was our satisfaction when we saw ourselves on shore ; and 
my partner told me he dreamed he had a very heavy load 
upon his back, which he was to carry up a hill, and found 
that he was not able'to stand longer under it ; but that the 
Portuguese jnlot came and took it off his back, and the liill 
disappeared, the ground before him appearing all smooth 
and plain : and truly it was so ; they were alT like men who 
had a load taken off their backs. For my part, I had a 
weight taken off from my heart that it was not able any 
longer to bear ; and, as I said above, we resolved to go nc 
more to sea in that ship. When we came on shore, the old 
pilot, who was now our friend, got us a lodging and a ware- 
house for our goods, which, by the way, was much the same; 
it was a little house, or hut, with a larger house adjoining 
to it, all built with canes, and palisadoed round with large 
:anes, to keep out pilfering thieves, of which, it seems, there 
were not a few in that country ; however, the magistrates 
allowed us a little guard, and we had a soldier with a kind 
df halberd, or half-pike, who stood sentinel at oar door ; ta 
If hom we allowed a pint of rice, and a little piece of money

•boat the value of three-pence, per day, so that J.ir k^kkU 
were kept very safe. 

The fair, or mart, usually kept in this place, had been 
aver some time ; however, we found that there were three 
or four junks in the river, and two Japaners, I mean ships 
from Japan, with goods which they had bought in China, 
and were not gone away, having some Japanese merchant! 
on shore. 

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us was, 
to get us acquainted with three missionary Romish priests 
who were in town, and who had been there some time con- 
verting the people to Christianity; but we thought they 
mad^ but poor work of it, and made them but sorry Chris- 
tians when they had done : however, that was none of our 
business. One of these was a Frenchman, whom they called 
Father Simon ; another was a Portuguese, and the third, a 
Genoese : but Father Simon was courteous, easy in his 
manner, and very agreeable company ; the other two were 
more reserved, seemed rigid and austere, and applied serious- 
ly to the work they came about, viz., to talk with, and 
insinuate themselves among, the inhabitants, wherever they 
had opportunity. We often ate and drank with those men ; 
and though, I must confess, the conversion, as they call it, 
of the Chinese to Christianity is so far from tlie true con- 
version required to bring heathen people to the faith oi 
Christ, that it seems to amount to little mere than lettiuf; 
them know the name of Christ, and say some prayers to the 
Virgin Mary and her Son, in a tongue which they under- 
stand not, and to cross themselves, and the like ; yet it must 
be confessed that the religionists, whom we call missionaries, 
have a firm belief that these people will be saved, and that 
they are the instruments of it; and, on this account, they

But to return .o my story. This French piiest, Fathei 
Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order of the chief of the 
mission, to go up to Peking, the royal seat of the Chiness 
•mperor, and waited only for another priest, who was ordered 
to come to him from Macao, to go along with him ; and ^^ 
scarce ever met together but he was inviting me to go that 
journey ; telling me how he would show me all the glorious 
things of that mighty empire, and, among the rest, the 
greatest city in the world ; a city, said he, that your London 
and our Paris put together, cannot be equal to. Thi9 was 
the city of Peking, which, I confess, is very great, and in- 
finitely full of people ; but as I looked on those things with 
different eyes from other men, so I shall give my opinion 
of them in a few words, when I come in course of my travels 
to speak more particularly of them. 

But, first, I come to my friar or missionary. Dining with 
him one day, and being very merry together, I showed some 
little inclination to go Avith him ; and he pressed me and my 
partner very hard, and with a great many persuasions, tc 
consent. Why, Father Simon, says my partnei, should you 
desire our company so much ? you know we are heretics, 
and you do not love us, nor cannot keep us company with 
any pleasure. — O, says he, you may perhaps be good Cath- 
olics in time ; my business here is to convert heathens, and 
who knows but I may convert you too? — Very well, Fitber, 
sftid I, so you will preach to us all the way ? — I will not be 
troublesome to you, says he ; our religion does not ditest U4 
of good manners: besides, we are here like count\vmcn; 
and so we are, compared to the place we are in ; an^ if you 
are Huguenots, and I a Catholic, we may all be Christians at 
last ; at least, we are alNgentlemen, and we may converse 
10, without being uneasy to one another. I liked this part 
»f his di^cn irse very well, and it began to put m9 *n mind 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 661 

if my priest that I had left in the Brazils ; but this Fathei 
Simon did not come up to his character by a great deal ; fo:r 
vh mgh Father Simon had no appearance of a criminal levitj 
in him neither, yet he had not that fund of Christian zeal 
strict piety, and sincere affection to religion, that ray othe! 
good ecclesiastic had. 

But to leave him a little, though he never left us, uoi 
soliciting us to go with him ; we had something else before ui 
at first, for we had all this while our ship and our merchan- 
dise to dispose of, and we began to be very doubtful what we 
should do, for we were now in a place of very, little 
business ; and once I was about to venture to sail for the 
river of Kilam, and the city of Nanquin : but Providence 
seemed now more visibly, as I thought, than ever, to concern 
itself in our affaiis ; and I was encouraged, from this verj 
time, to think I should one way or other get out of this en- 
tangled circumstance, and be brought home to my own 
country again, though I had not the least view of the man- 
ner. Providence, I say, began here to clear up our way a 
little ; and the first thing that offered was, that our old Por- 
tugese pilot brought a Japan merchant to us, who inquired 
what goods we had ; and, in the first place, he bought all 
our opium, and gave us a very good price for it, paying us in 
gold by weight, some in small pieces of their own coin, and 
some in small wedges, of about ten or eleven ounces each. 
While we were dealing with him for our opium, it came into 
my head that he might perhaps deal for the ship too, and 1 
ordered the interpreter to propose it to him : he shrugged up 
his shoulders at it, when it was first proposed to him ; but 
in a few days after he came to me, with one of the mission- 
ary priests for his interpreter, and told me he had a proposal 
10 makfi to me, which was this : — he had bought a great 
quantity of goods of us, when he hai no thoughts of 
proposals made to him of buying the ship ; and that, there- 
fore, he had not money enough to pay for the ship : but if I 



ftfg ADVENTURES OF 

would let the same men who were in the ship navigute het 
he would hire the ship to go to Japan ; and would send them 
from thence to the Philippine islands with another loading, 
which he would pay the freight of before they went from 
Japan, and that at their return he would buy the ship. I 
began to listen to his proposal, and so eager did my head 
still run upon rambling, that I could not but begin to enter- 
tain a notion of going myself with him, and so to sail from 
the P]iilippine islands away to the South Seas : accordingly 
I asked the Japanese merchant if he would not hire us to 
the Philippine islands, and discharge us there. He said, 
No, he could not do that, for then he could not hare the 
return of his cargo ; but he would discharge us in Japan, at 
the ship's return. Well, still I was for taking him at that 
proposal, and going myself ; but my partner, wiser than my- 
self, persuaded me from it, representing the dangers, as well 
of the seas as of the Japanese, who are a false, cruel, and 
treacherous people ; likewise those of the Spaniards at the 
Philippines, more false, cruel, and treacherous than they. 

But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a conclusion ; 
the first thing we had to do was, to consult with the captain 
of the ship, and with his men, and know if they were willing 
to go to Japan : and while I was doing this, the young man 
whom my nephew had left with me as my companion for my 
travels came to me, and told me that he thought that voyage 
promised very fair, and that there was a great prospect oi 
advantage, and he would be very glad if I undertook it ; but 
that if I would not, and would give him leave, he would go 
as a merchant, or how I pleased to order him ; that if ever 
he came to England, and I was there and alive, he would render 
me a faithful account of his success, which should be as much 
nine as I pleased. I was really loth to part with him ; but 
considering the prospect of advantage, which j^as really con- 
liderable, aid that he was a young fellow as likely to da 
«rell in H as any I knew, I inclined to let him go ; but J 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 5fj^ 

told him I would consult my partner, and give him an ati^we. 
the next day. My partner and I discoursed about it, and my 
partner made a most generous offer : You know it has been 
an unlucky ship said, he, and we both resolve not to go to 
lea in it again : if your steward (so he called my man) will 
venture the voyage, I will leave my share of the veesel to 
him, and let him make the best of it ; and if we live to 
meet in England, and he meets with success abroad, he shall 
account for one half of the profits of the ship*8 freight to 
us ; the other shall be his own. 

If my partner, who was no way concerned with my yoting 
man, made him such an offer, I could no less than offer him 
the same : and all the ship's company being willing lo go 
with him, we made over half the ship to him in property, and 
took a writing from him, obliging him to account for the 
other ; and away he went to Japan. The Japan merchant 
proved a very punctual, honest man to him : protected nim 
at Japan, and got him a license to come on shore, which the 
Europeans in general have not lately obtained ; paid him his 
freight very pimctually ; sent him to the Philippines, loaded 
writh Japan and China wares, and a supercargo of their own, 
who, trafficking with the Spaniard, brought back European 
goods again, and a great quantity of cloves and other spices ; 
and there he was not only paid his freight very well, and at 
a very good price, but not being willing to sell the ship then, 
the merchant furnished him with goods on his own account ; 
and with some money, and some spices of his own which he 
brought with him, he went back to the Manillas to the Span- 
lards, where he sold his cargo very well. Here, having got 
& good acquaintance at Manilla, he got his ship made a free 
ship ; and the governor of Manilla hired him to go to Aca* 
pulco in America, on the coast of Mexico, and gave him a 
license to land there, and to travel to Mexico, and to pass id 
any Spanish ship to Europe with all his men. He made th« 
toy age to Acapulco very happily, and there he sold tiis f hip •

and having taere also obtained allowance to travel by land 
to Porto Bello, he found means, somehow or other, to get ta 
Jamaica, with all his treasure ; and about eight years afltei 
cane to England exceeding rich, of which I shall tak« 
notice in its place : in the mean time, I return to our partio* 
ular affairs. 

Being now to part with the ship and ship's company, it 
tame before us, of course, to consider what recompense we 
should give to the two men that gave us such timely notice 
of the design against us in the river Cambodia. The truth 
was, they had done us a very considerable service, and de- 
served well at our hands ; though, by the way, they were a 
couple of rogues too : for as they believed the story of our 
being pirates, and that we had really run away with the 
ship, they came down to us not only to betray the design 
that was formed against us, but to go to sea with us as 
pirates ; and one of them confessed afterwards that nothing 
else but the hopes of going a-roguing brought him to do it : 
however, the service they did us was not the less ; and 
therefore, as I had promised to be grateful to them, I first 
ordered the money to be pmd them which they said was due 
to them on board their respective ships ; over and above 
that, I gave each of them a small sum of money in gold, 
which contented them very well ; then I made the English- 
man gunner in the ship, the gunner being now made second 
mate and purser ; the Dutchman I made boatswain : so they 
were both very well pleased, and proved very serviceable, 
being both able seamen, and very stout fellows. 

We were now on shore in China : if I thought myeeil 
banished and remote from my own country at Bengal, where 
I had man][ ways to get home for my money, what could I 
think of myself now, when I was got about a thousand 
leagues farther off from home, and perfectly destitute of all 
manner of prospect of return ? All we had for it was thisi 
that in about four months' time there was to be another fail 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 571 

At tli<: place ivlure we were, and then we might be able U 
purchase all sorts of the manufactures of the country, and 
withal might possibly find some Chinese junks or vesseli 
from Tonquin, that would be to be sold, and would carry ui 
and our goods whither we pleased. This I liked very well, 
and resolved to wait ; besides, as our particular persons were 
not obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch ships came 
thither, perhaps we might have an opportunity to load oui 
goods, and get passage to some other place in India, nearex 
home. Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here ; but, 
to divert ourselves, we took two or three journeys into the 
country. First, we went ten days* journey, to the city of 
Nanquin, a city well worth seeing, indeed ; they say it has 
a million of people in it : it is regularly built, the streets all 
exactly straight, and cross one another in direct lines, which 
gives the figure of it great advantage. But when I come to 
compare the miserable people of these countries with ours, 
their fabrics, their manner of living, their government, their 
wealth, and their glory, as some call it, I must confess thai 
I scarcely think it worth my while to mention them here. 
It is very observable, that we wonder at the grandeur, the 
riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the government, the man- 
ufacturers, the commerce, and conduct of these people ; not 
that it is to be wondered at, or, indeed, in the least to be 
regarded, but because having a true notion of the barbarity 
of those countries, the rudeness and the ignorance that pre- 
vails there, we do not expect to find any such thing so far 
off. Otherwise, what are their buildings to the palaces and 
royal buildings of Europe ? What their trade to the 
universal commerce of England, Holland, France, and 
Spain? What are their cities to ours, for wealtl^ strengtli, 
gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, and infinite variety ? What 
wre their ports, supplied with a few junks and barks, to oui

y/2 ADVENTURES OF 

mighty empire : one English, Dutch, or French man-cf-wal 
of eighty guns, would be able to fight almost all the 8hi[ping 
belonging to China : but the greatness of their wealth, theit 
trade, the power of their government, and the strength of 
:heir armies, may be a little surprising to us ; because, as 1 
have said, considering them as a barbarous nation of pagans, 
little better than savages, we did not expect such things 
among them. And this, indeed, is the advantage with* which 
all their greatness and power is represented to us ; other- 
wise, it is in itself nothing at all : for what I have said o1 
their ships may be said of their armies and troops : all the 
forces of their empire, though they were to bring two 
millions of men into the field together, would be able to do 
nothing but niin the country, and starve themselves, if they 
were to besiege a strong town in Flanders, or to fight a dis- 
ciplined army. One good line of German cuirassiers, or of 
French cavalry, might withstand all the horse of Ch Jia : a 
million of their foot could not stand before one emoattled 
body of our infantry, posted so as not to be surrounded, 
though they were not to be one to twenty in number : nay, 
I do not boast if I say that thirty thousand German or Eng- 
lish foot, and ten thousand horse, well managed, could 
defeat all the forces of China. And so of our fortified 
towns, and of the art of our engineers in assaulting and de- 
fending towns : there is not a fortified town in China could 
hold out one month against the batteries and attacks of an 
European army ; and, at the same time, all the armies of 
China could never take such a town as Dunkirk, provided it 
was not starved — no, not in a ten years' siege. They have 
fire-arms, it is true, but they are awkward and uncertain in 
their goiiy off: and their powder has but little strength. 
Their armies are badly disciplined, and want skill to attack, 
or temper to retreat ; and, therefore, I must confess, it 
leemed strange to me, when I came home, and heard ooi 
people say such fine things of the power, glory, magnificenoo

u&d ttade of the Oliinese ; because, as far as I saw, the| 
appeared to be a contemptible herd or crowd of ignorani 
sordid slaves, subjected to a govemmeiit qualified only tc 
rule such a people : and were not its distance inconceivably 
great from Muscovy, and the Muscovite empire in a manner 
as rude, impotent, and ill governed as they, the Czar o! 
Muscovy might with ease drive them all out of their country, 
tend conquer them in one campaign : and had the Czar (who 
is now a growing prince) fallen this way, instead of attack- 
ing the warlike Swedes, and equally improved himself in the 
art of war, as they say he has done ; and if none of the 
powers of Europe had envied or interrupted him, he might 
by this time have been emperor of China, instead of being 
beaten by the king of Sweden at Narva, when the latter 
was not one to six in number. As their strength and their 
grandeur, so their navigation, commerce, and husbandry are 
very imperfect, compared to the same things in Europe ; also 
in their knowledge, their learning, and in their skill in the 
sciences, they are either very awkward or defective, though 
they have globes and spheres, and a smattering of the math- 
ematics, and think they know more than all the world 
besides ; but they know little of the motions of the heavenly 
bodies ; and so grossly and absurdly ignorant are their com- 
mon people, that when the sun is eclipsed, they think a great 
dragon has assaulted it, and is going to run away with it ; 
and they fall a clattering with all the drums and kettles in 
the country, to fright the monster away, just as we do to 
hive a ewsurih of bees. 

As this is the only excursion of the kind which I have 
made in all the accounts I have given of my travels, I shall 
make no more such : it is none of my business, nor any 
^t of my design ; but to give an account of my own 
adventures through a life of inimitable wanderings, and a

I WAS now, as near as I can compute, in the heart of China, 
about thirty degrees north of the line, for we were returned 
from Nanquin : 1 had, indeed, a mind to see the city oi 
Peking, which I had heard so much of, and Father Simon 
importuned me daily to do it. At length his time of going 
away being set, and the other missionary who was to go 
with him being turrived from Mstcao, it was necessary that 
we should resolve either to go or not; so I referred it wholly 
to my partner, and left it wholly to his choice, who 
at length resolved it in the affirmative; and we pre- 
pared for our journey. We set out with very good 
advantage as to finding the way, for we got leave to 
travel in the retinue of one of their Mandarins, a kind oi 
viceroy or principal magistrates in the proyince where they 
reside, and who take great state upon them, travelling with 
great attendance, and with great homage from* the people, 
who are sometimes greatly impoverished by them, being 
obliged to furnish provisions for them and all their attend* 
ants in their journeys. That which I particularly observed, 
as to our travelling with his baggage, was this, that though 
we received sufficent provisions both for ourselves and oni 
worses from the country, as belonging to the Mandarin, yet 
P9 wore obliged to pay for everything we had after thu

country gentleman, as leather Simon called him, alout ten 
eagues off the city of Nanquin, we had first of all the honot 
to ride with the master of the house about two miles ; the 
fltate he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism, beinj? a mix- 
ture (ff pomp and poverty. His habit was very proper for a 
scaramouch, or merry-andrew, being a dirty calico, with 
hanging sleeves, tassels, and cuts and slashes almost or 
e* ery side : it covered a taffety vest, as greasy as a butcher's, 
and which testified that his honor must be a most exquisit^ ^ 
sloven. His horse was but a poor, starved, hobbling ^^a 
ture, and he had two slaves followed hinri 9^ fQ^\ f^ drive 
the poor creature a.'ong ; he had^^,.»»fef]pl^i8 hand, and he 
belabored the beast as fajt-sfi^ the head as his slaves did 
about theJaiJ'^'-aiiSThus he rode by us, with about ten or 
twelve bcrvants, going from the city to his country seat, 
about half a league before us. We travelled on gently, 
but this figure of a gentleman rode away before us ; and aa 
we stopped at a village about an hour to refiresh us, when 
we came by the country seat of this great man, we saw him 
in a little place before his door, eating his repast. It was a 
kind of a garden, but he was very easy to be seen ; and we 
were given to understand that the more we looked at him 
the better he would be pleased. He sat under a tree, some- 
thing like the palmetto, which effectually shaded him over 
the head, and on the south side ; but under the tree wat 
also placed a large umbrella, which made that part .look well 
enough. He sat lolling back in a great elbow-chair, being a 
Heavy corpulent man, and had his meat brought him by two 
women slaves ; he hud two more, one of which fed the squire 
with a 8j)oon, and the other held the dish with one hand, 
and scraped off what he let fall upon his worship's beard 
and taffety vest with the other ; while the great fat brute

marliet price of the country, and the Mandarin's steward 
collected it duly from us ; so that our travelling in the 
retinue of the Mandarin, though it was a very great kind- 
ness to lis, was not such a mighty favor in him, but was a 
great advantage to him, considering there were about thirty 
3ther people travelled in the same manner besides us, undei 
the protection of his retinue ; for the country furnished all 
the provisions for nothing to him, and yet he took our money 
for them. 

We were twenty-five days travelling to Peking, through a 
country infinitely populous, but I think badly cultivated ; 
the husbandry, the economy, and the way of living misera- 
ole, though they boast so much of the industry of the 
people : I say miserable, if compared with our own, but 
not so to these poor wretches, who know no other. The 
pride of the people is infinitely great, and exceeded by 
nothing but their poverty, in some parts, which adds to that 
which I call their misery ; and 1 must needs tliink the naked 
savages of America live much more happily than the pooyest 
sort of these, because as they have nothing, so they desire 
nothing : whereas these are proud and insolent, and in the 
main are in many parts mere beggars and drudges ; their 
ostentation is inexpressible ; and, if they can, they love lo 
keep multitudes of servants or slaves, which is to the last 
degree ridiculous, as well as the contempt of all the world 
but themselves. 

1 must confess, I travelled more pleasantly afterwards in 
.he deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartary than 
here ; and yet the roads here are well paved and well kept, 
and very convenient for travellers; but nothing was more 
awkward to me than to see such a haughty, imperious, in- , 
•olent people, in the midst of the grossest simplicity and 
Ignorance ; and my friend Father Simon and I used to be 
very merry upon these occasions, to see the beggarly pride 
ol tL^se people. For example, coming by the house of a

rati er do than be troubled with the clumsy fingers of theii 
servants. 

1 took this time to think what pains men's pride pul them 
to, and how troublesome a haughty temper, thus ill man- 
aged, must be to a man of common sense ; and leavitg the 
poor wretch to please himself with our looking at him, as 
if we admired his ppmp, though we really pitied and con- 
temned him, we pursued our journey ; only Father Simon 
had the curiosity to stay to inform himself what dainties the 
country justice had to feed on in all his state, which he had 
the honor to taste of, and which was, I think, a mess of 
bailed rice, with a great piece of garlic in it, and a little bag 
filled with green pepper, and another plant which they have 
there, something like our ginger, but smelling like musk, 
and tasting like mustard ; all this was put together, and 
a small piece of lean mutton boiled in it, and this was his 
worship's repast ; four or five servants more attended at a 
distance, who, we supposed, were to eat of the same after 
their master. 

As for our Mandarin with whom we travelled, he was 
respected as a king, surrounded always with his gentlemen, 
and attended in all his appearances with such pomp, that I 
saw little of him but at a distance ; but this I observed, 
that there was not a horse in his retinue but that our car 
rier's pack-horses in England seemed to me to look much 
better ; though it was hard to judge rightly, for they were 
BO covered with equipage, mantles, trappings, di^c, that we 
could scarce see anything but their feet and their heads as 
they went along. 

I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and perplexity 
that I have given an account of being over, I had no anxious 
thought about me, which made this journey the pleasanter 
«o me ; nor had I any ill accident attended me, only in pas 
■ing or folding a small river my horse fell, and made me

touched at in this journey. 

At length we arrived at Peking : I had nobody with mo 
but the youth whom my nephew the captain had given me to

gent ; and my partner had nobody with him, but one servant, 
who was a kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being de* 
sirouB to see the court, we bore his charges for his company, 
and to use him as an interpreter, for he understood the lan- 
guage of the country, and spoke good French, and a little 
English ; and, indeed, this old man Was a most useful imple- 
ment to us every where : for we had not been above a week 
at Peking, when he came laughing. Ah, Senhor Inglese, says 
ne, I have something to tell you will make your heart glad ! 
— My heart glad ! says 1 ; what can that be ? I don*t know 
anything in this counUy can either give me joy or grief, to 
any great degree. — Yes, yes, said the old man, in broken 
English, make you glad, me sorry. — Why, said I, will it 
make you sorry ? — Because, said he, you have brought me 
here twenty-five days' journey, and will leave me to go back 
alone, and which way shall I get to my port afterwards with- 
c ut a ship, without a horse, without pecune : so he called 
raocey, being his broken Latin, of which he had abundaooe

great caravan of Muscovite and Polish merchants in the city, 
preparing to set out on their journey by land to Moscow y, 
within four or five weeks, and he was sure we would take 
the opportunity to go with them, and leav^ him behind, tf 
|0 oack alone. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^ 679 

I confess I was greatly surprised with this goc 1 newa, and 
Lad scarce power to speak to him for some time ; but at lasi 
I turned to him, How do you know this ? said 1. Are yon 
iure it is true ? — Yes, says he : I met this morning in the 
street an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, who is 
among them : he came last from Astracan, and was designing 
to go to Tonquin, where 1 formerly knew him, but has al- 
tered his mind, and is now resolved to go with the caravan to 
Moscow, and so down the river VVolga to Astracan. ■ 
Well, senhor, says I, do not be uneasy about being left to go 
back alone ; if this be a method for my return to England, 
it shall be your fault if you go back to Macao at all. We 
then went to consult together what was to be done ; and I 
asked my partner what he thought of the pilot's news, and 
whether it would suit with his affairs ? He told me he would 
do just as I would ; for he had settlea all his affairs so well 
at Bengal, and left his effects in such good hands, that as we 
had made a good voyage here, if he could vest it in China 
silks, wrought and raw, such as might be worth the carriage, 
he would be content to go to England, and then make his 
voyage back to Bengal by the Company's ships. 

Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our Portu- 
guese pilot would go with us, we would bear his charges to 
Moscow, or to England, if he pleased ; nor, indeed, were we 
to be esteemed over generous in that neither, if we had not 
rewarded him farther, the service he had done us being 
really worth more than that; for he had not only been a 
pilot to us at sea, but he had been like a broker for is on 
shore ; and his procuring for us the Japau merchant was 
some hundreds of pounds in our pockets. So we consulted 
together about it, and being willing to gratify him, which 
was but doing him justice, and very willing also to have 
him with us besides, for he was a most necessary man on all 
occasions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coined gold, 
which, as 1 compute it, came to about one hundred an^

Beventy*five pounds sterling, between us, and to I ei r all hia 
charges, both for himself and horse,' except only a horse to 
tarry his goods. Having settled this between ourselves, w€ 
tailed him to let him know what we had resolved. I told 
uim he had complained of our being to let him go back 
tlone» and I was now to tell him we were resolved he should 
«ot go back at all ; that as we had resolved to go to Europe 
with the caravan, we resolved also he should go with us ; 
and that we called him to know his mind. He shook his 
nead, and said, it was a long journey, and he had no pecune 
to carry him thither, or to subsist himself when he came 
there. We told him we believed it was so, and therefore 
we had resolved to do something for him that should let 
him see how sensible we were of the service he had done us, 
and also how agreeable he was to us : and then I told him 
what we had resolved to give him here, which he might lay 
out as we would do our own ; and that as for his charges, ii 
he would go with us we would set him safe on shore (life 
and casualties excepted) either in Muscovy or England^ 
which he would at our own charge, except only the carriage 
of his goods. He received the proposal like a man trans* 
ported, and told us he would go with us over the whole 
world ; and so we all prepared for our journey. However, 
as it was with us, so it was with the other merchants : they 
had many things to do ; and instead of being ready in five 
weeks, it was four months and some days before all things 
were got together. 

It was the beginning of February, our style, when we set 
out firom Peking. My partner and the old pilot had gone 
express back to the port where we had first put in, to dis- 
pose of some goods which we had left there ; and I, with 8 
Chinese merchant whom I had some knowledge of at Nan« 
quin, and who came to Peking on his own afiairs, went to 
Vanquin, where I bought ninety pieces of fine damasks^ 
▼ith abo''t two hundred pieces of other very fine silks oi

•ereraj Mirts, some mixed with gold, and had all thest 
brought to Peking against my partner's return ; besides thia, 
we bought a very large quantity of raw silk, and some 
other £^ood3, our cargo amounting, in these goods only, t; 
about three thousand five hundred pounds sterling ; whicht 
together with tea, and some fine calicoes, and three camels* 
loads oi nutLiegs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen cameli 
for our share, besides those we rode upon ; which, with two 
or three spar^ horses, and two horses loaded with provisions, 
made us, in ihort, twenty-six camels and horses in our re- 
tinue. 

The comp ny was very great, and, as near as I can remem- 
ber, made between three and four hundred horse, and up- 
wards of OD-i hundred and twenty men, very well armed, and 
provided for all events : for as the Eastern caravans are sub- 
ject to be Attacked by the Arabs, so are these by the Tar- 
tars ; but they are not altogether so dangerous as the Arabs^ 
nor so barbarous, when they prevail. 

The company consisted of people of several nations ; but 
there were above sixty of them merchants or inhabitants oi 
Moscow, though of them some were Livonians : and to our 
particular satisfaction, five of them were Scots, who ap- 
peared also to be men of .great experience in business, and 
of very good substance. 

When we had travelled one day's journey, the guides, 
who were five in number, called all the gentlemen and mer- 
ehants, that is to say, all the passengers except the servants, 
to a great council as they called it. At this council every 
one deposited a certain quantity of money to a common 
stock, for the necessary expense of buying forage on the 
way, where it was not otherwise to be had, and for satisfy* 
*ng the guides, getting horses, and the like : and here they 
instituted the journey, as they called it, viz , they named 
saptains and officers to draw us all up, and give the word ol 
lommand, in ca^e of an attack, and give every one their tuii

(Lan what we found needful upon the way, as shall be ob* 
lerv^ed. 

The road all on this side of the country is very popu- 
lous, and is full of potters and earth-makers, that is to say, 
people that temper the earth for the China-ware ; and as ] 
was coming along, our Portugal pilot, who had always some* 
thing or other to say to make us merry, came sneering to 
me, and told me he would show me the greatest rarity in all 
the country, and that I should have this to say of China, 
alter all the ill-humored things I had said of it, that I had 
seen one thing which was not to be seen in all the world be- 
side^ I was very importunate to know^inrhat it was : at last 
he told me it was a gentleman^s house built with China- 
ware. Well, says 1, are not the materials of their buildings 
the product of their own country, and so it is all China- 
ware, is it not ? — No, no, says he, I mean it is a house all 
made of China-ware, such as you call it in England, or, as it 
Is called in our country, porcelain. — Well, says I, such a 
thing may be ; how big is it ? Can we carry it in a box 
upon a camel ? If we can, we will buy it. -^ Upon a camel I 
says the old pilot, holding, up both his hands ; why there is 

family of thirty people lives in it. 

I was then curious, indeed, to see it ; and when I came 
to it, it was nothing but this :* it was a timber house, or a 
house built, as they call it in' England, with lath and plas- 
ter; but all this plastering was really China-ware, that 
is to say, it was plastered with the earth that makes China- 
ware. The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was 
glazed, and looked very well, perfectly white, and painted 
with blue figures, as the large China-ware in England k 
painted, and hard as if it had been burned. As to the in* 
side, all the walls instead of wainscot, were lined with haid- 
tned and painted tiles, like the little square tiles we caU 
fslley-tiles in England, all made of the finest China, and

flie figures exceeding fine, indeed, with extraordinary variety 
»! coltjrs, mixed with gold ; many tiles making but one fig- 
ure, but joined so artificially, the mor ar being made of the 
tame earth, that it was very hard to see where the tiles met 
The floors of the rooms were of the same composition, and 
as hard as the earthem floors we have in use in several part> 
of England ; as hard as stone, and smooth, but not burned 
and painted, except some smaller rooms, like closets, which 
were all as it were paved with the same tile ; the ceiling, 
and all the plastering work in the whole house, were of the 
same earth ; and, after all, the roof was covered with tiles 
of the same, but of a deep shining black. This was a 
Chiua warehouse, indeed, truly and literally to be called so, 
and had I not been upon a journey, 1 could have stayed 
some days to see and examine the particulars of it. They 
told me there were fountains and fishponds in the garden, 
all paved on the bottom and sides with the same ; and fine 
utatues set up in rows on the walks, entirely formed of the 
porcelain earth, and burned whole. 

As this is one of the singularities of China, so they may 
be allowed to excel in it ; but I am very sure they excel in 
their accounts of it ; for they told me such incredible things 
of their performance in crockery-ware, for such it is, that I 
care not to relate, as knowing it could not be true. They 
told me, in particular, of one workman that made a ship 
with all its tackle, and masts- and sails, in earthem- ware, big 
enough to carry fifty men. If they had told me he ' munched 
it, and made a voyage to Japan in it, I might have said some- 
thing to it, indeed ; but as it was, I knew the whole of the 
itory, which was, in short, asking pardon for the word, that 
the fellow lied : so I smiled, and said nothing to it. 

This cdd sight kept mo two hours behind the caravan, foi 
which ths leader of it for the day fined me about the value 
^f three shillings : and told me, if it had been three days 
{oamey without the wall, as it was three days' within, hi

nkxat have fined me four times as much, and made me Ail 
(Murdon the next council day : I promised to be more Drderij . 
and, indeed, I found afterwards the orders made for keeping 
all together were absolutely necessary for our common 
safety. 

In two days more we passed the great China wall, made 
'or a fortification against the Tartars : and a very great work 
it is, going over hills and mountains in a needless track, 
where the rocks are impassable, and the precipices such as 
no enemy could possibly enter, or indeed climb up, or where, 
if they did, no wall could hinder them. They tell us its 
length is near a thousand English miles, but that the cov^lltry 
Is five hundred in a straight measured line, which the wall 
bounds, without measuring the windings and tvimisi^s it' 
takes : it is about four fathoms high, and as many th.ck in 
some places. 

I stood still an hour, or thereabout, without trespassing 
our orders (for so long the caravan was in passing the gate), 
to look at it on every side, near and far off, 1 mean th it was 
within my view; and the guide of our caravan, who had 
been eztoUmg it for the wonder of the woild, was inighty 
eager to hear my opinion of it. I told him it was a most 
excellent thing to keep out the Tartars ; which he happened 
not to understand as I meant it, and so took it for a compli- 
ment ; but the old pilot laughed : O, Senhor Inglese, says 
he, you speak in colors. — In colors ! said I ; what do you 
mean by that? — Why you speak what looks white this 
way, and black that way : gay one way, and dull another. 
You tell him it is a good wall to keep out Tartars ; you tell 
me by that it is good for nothing; but to keep out Tartars. 
I understand you, Senhor Inglese ; I understand yon ; but 
Senhor Chinese understood you his own way. — Well, says 
I, senhor, do you think it would stand out an army of oui 
tonntry people, with a good train of artillery, or oui 
ngineers, with two companies of minerf ^ Would not the)

^atter it down im ten days, that an army might entei i ba^ 
talia ; or blow it up in the air, foundation and all, that then 
■hould be no sign of it left ? — Ay, ay, says he, I know that 
The Chinese wanted mightily to know what I said, and I 
gave him leave to tell him a few days after, for we were then 
almost out of their country, and he was to leave us in a 
little time after this ; but when he knew what I «8aid, he 
was dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard no more ol 
his fine story of th) Chinese power and greatness while he 
stayed. 

After we passed this mighty nothing, called a wall, some- 
thing like the Picts' wall, so famous in Northumberland, 
built by the Romans, we began to find the country thinly in- 
habited, and the people rather confined to live in fortified 
towns and cities, as being subject to the inroads and depre- 
dations of the Tartars, who rob in great armies, and there- 
fore are not to be resisted by the naked inhabitants of an 
open country. And here I began to find the necessity ol 
keeping together in a caravan as we travelled, for we saw 
several troops of Tartars roving about ; but when I came to 
see them distinctly, I wondered more that the Chinese empire 
should be conquered by such contemptible fellows ; for they 
are a mere horde of wild fellows, keeping no order, and un- 
derstanding no discipline or manner of fight. Their horses 
are poor lean creatures, taught nothing, and fit for nothing ; 
and this we found the first day we saw them, which was 
after we entered the wilder part of the country. Our leadei 
for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us to go a hunt- 
ing, as they call it, and what was this but hunting of sheep . 
however, it may be called hunting too, for the creatures are 
the wildest and swiftest of foot that ever I saw of theii 
kind ; only they will not run a great way, and you are surt 
of sport when you begin the chase, for they appear generallv 
thirty or forty in a flock, and, like true sheep, alwa j9 kee| 
logeth*? wh^i they fly. 



|ge A0VENTUBE8 OF 

In purd lit of this 3dd sort of game, it was oui hap to 
meet with about forty Tartars ; whether they were lonting 
mutton as we were, or whether they looked for anotler kind 
of prey, we know not ; but as soon as they saw us, one ol 
tiiem blew a kind of horn very loud, but with a barbarous 
sound that I had nearer heard before, and, by the way, never 
care to. hear again : we all supposed this was to call their 
friends about them, and so it was ; for in less than ten min- 
utes a troop of forty of fifly more appeared at about a mile 
distance ; but our work was over first, as it happened. 

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to be 
amongst us, and as soon as he heard the horn he told us that 
we had nothing to do but to charge them immediately, with- 
out loss of time ; and drawing us up in a line, he asked ii 
we were resolved. We told him we were ready to follow 
him ; so he rode directly towards them. They stood gazing 
at us like a mere crowd, drawn up in no order, nor showing 
&e face of any order at all ; but as soon as they saw us ad- 
vance, they let fiy their arrows, which, however, missed us 
very happily : it seems they mistook not their aim, but their 
distance ; for their arrows all fell a little short of us, but 
with so true an aim, that had we been about twenty yards 
Bearer, we must have had several men wounded, if not 
killed. 

Immediately we halted, and though it was at a great dis* 
tance, we fired, and sent them leaden bullets for wooden 
arrows, following our shot full gallop, to fall in among them 
sword in hand, for so our bold Scot that led us directed. He 
was, indeed, but a merchant, but he behaved with such vigoi 
and bravery on this occasion, and yet with such cool courage 
too, that I never saw any man in action fitter for command 
As soon as we came up to them, we fired our pistols in their 
faces, and tIteA drew ; but they fled in the greatest confusion

lest Xc come back to them, having a kind of scimitar ^n theii 
hands, and their bows hanging to their backs. Our brave 
commander, witaoiit asking anybody to follow him, gallopt 
up close to them, and with his fusee knocks one of them ofl 
his horse, killed the second with his pistol, and the third ran 
away ; and thus ended our fight : but we had this misfor- 
tune attending it, that all our mutton we had in chase got 
away. We had not a man killed or hurt ; but as for the 
Tartars, there were about five of them killed ; how many 
were wounded we knew not ; but this we knew, that the 
other party were so frightened with the noise of our guns., 
that they made off, and never made any attempt upon us. 

We were all this while in the Chinese dominions, and 
therefore the Tartars were not so bold as afterwards : but in 
about five days we entered a vast, great, wild desert, which 
held U3 three days and nights' march ; and we were obliged 
to carry our water with us in great leathern bottles, and to 
encamp all night, just as I have heard they do in the desert 
of Arabia. 

I asked our guides whose dominion this was in ; and they 
told me this was a kind of border, that might be called no 
man's land, being a part of Great Karakathay, or Grand 
Tartary ; but, however, it was all reckoned as belonging to 
China, but, that there was no care taken here to preserve it 
from the inroads of thieves, and therefore it was reckoned 
the worst desert in the whole march, though we were to gc 
over some much larger. 

In passing this wilderness, which was at first very fright- 
ful to me, we saw, two or three times, little parties of the 
Tartars, but they seemed to be upon their own affairs, and 
o have no design upon us ; and so, like the man who me( 
the devil, if they had nothing to say to us, we had nothiiig 
to say to them ; we let them go. Once, however, a party 
9f them came so near as to stand and gaze at us ; whethei

not ; bat when we were passed at some distance b} them, 
we made a rear guard of forty men, and stood ready for them, 
letting the caravan pass half a mile or thereabouts before 
Qs: but after a while they marched off; only we found they 
saluted us with five arrows at their parting, one of which 
wounded a horse, so that it disabled him, and we left him 
^or creature, in great need of a good farrier : they might 
shoot more arrows, which might fall short of us, but we saw 
no more arrows or Tartars that time. 

We travelled near a month after this, the ways not being 
so good as at first, though still in the dominions of the em- 
peror of China, but lay for the most part in villages, some 
of which were fortified, because of the incursions of the 
Tartars. When we were come to one of these towns (it was 
about two days and a half journey before we were to come 
to the city of Naum), I wanted to buy a camel, of which 
there are plenty to be sold all the way upon that road, and 
horses also, such as they are, because so many caravans 
coming that way, they are often wanted. The person that 1 
spoke to get me a camel, would have gone and fetched one 
for me ; but I, like a fool, must be ofiicious, and go myseli 
along with him : the place was about two miles out of the 
village, where it seems they kept the camels and horses 
feeding under a guard. 

I walked it on foot, with my old pilot and a Chinese, 
being very desirous of a little variety. When we came to 
the place, it was a low marshy ground, walled round with a 
stone wall, piled up dry, without mortar or earth among it, 
like a park, with a little guard of Chinese soldiers at the 
door. Having bought a camel, and agreed* for the price, I 
came away, and the Chinese man that went with me led the 
^amel, when on a sudden came up five Tartars on horseback ; 
two of them seized the fellow and took the camel from him, 
while the other Ijiree stepped up to me and my old pilot, 
leeinjg^ us, as it were, unarmed, for I had no weapoi^ c^bPB^

to» but my sword, which could but ill defend me agains 
three horsen an. The first that came up stopped short upon 
my drawing my sword, for they are arrant cowards ; but % 
second coming upon my left, gave me a blow on the head, 
which I never felt till afterwards, and wondered, when I 
eame to myself, what was the matter, and where I was, for 
he laid me flat on the ground ; but my never-failing old 
pilot, the Portuguese (so Providence, unlookcd for, directs 
deliverances from dangers which to us are unforeseen), had 
a pistol in his pocket,, which 1 knew nothing of, nor the 
Tartars neither ; if they had, I suppose they would not have 
Attacked us ; but cowards are always boldest when there 
is no danger. The old man seeing me down, with a bold 
heart stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and 
laying hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling him 
down by main^ force a little towards him with the other, 
shot him in the head, and laid him dead upon the spot. 
He then immediately stepped up to him who had stopped 
as, as I said, and before he could come forward again, made 
a blow at him with a scimitar which he always wo»e, but 
missing the man, cut his horse in the side of his head, cut 
one of the ears off, by the root, and a great slice down by 
the side of his face. The poor beast, enraged with the 
wound, was no more to be governed by his rider, though 
the fellow sat well enough too, but away he flew, and car- 
ried him quite out of the pilct's reach and at some distarce, 
rising upon his hind legs, threw down the Tartar, and*fe21 
upon him. 

In this interval, the poor Chinese came in who had lost 
<he camel, but he had no weapon ; however, seeing the 
Tartar down, and his horse fallen upon him, away he runs 
to him, and seizing upon an ugly ill-favored weapon he had 
by his side, something like a pole-axe but not a pole-axe 
neither, he wrenched it from him, and n^de shift to knock 
^is Tt»rtarian brains out with it. But my old man had tht

third Tartar to deal with still ; and seeing He did no .y 
RS he expected, nor come on to fig at him, as Le apprehei ed. 
but stand stock-still, the old man stood still toe. anc fell 
to work with his tackle, to charge his pistol again ; but aa 
soon as the Tartar saw the pistol, away he scoured, and lef. 
my pilot, my champion I called him afterward, a complete 
victory. 

By this time I was a little recovered ; for I thought whf.o 
I first began to wake, that I had been in a sweet sleep ; but, 
as I said above, I Wondered where 1 was, how I came upon 
the ground, and what was the matter. But a few moments 
after, as sense returned, 1 felt pain, though I did not know 
where ; so I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away 
bloody : then I felt my head ache ; and then, in a moment, 
memory returned, and every thing was present to me again. 
I jumped upon my feet instantly, and got hold of my sword, 
but no enemies in view : I found a Tartar lie dead, and his 
horse standing very quietly by him ; and, looking further, 1 
saw my champion and deliverer, who had been to see what 
the Chinese had done, coming back with his hanger in hir 
band : the old man, seeing me on my feet, came running to 
me, and embraced me with a great deal of joy, being afraid 
before that I had been killed ; and seeing me bloody, would 
see how I was hurt : but it was not much, only what we 
call a broken head ; neither did I afterwards find any great 
inconvenience from the blow, for it was well again in two o? 
three days. 

We made no great gain, however, by this victory, for w« 
lost a camel and gained a horse ; but that which was rt»- 
markable, when we came back tc the village, the man de- 
manded to be paid for the camel , I disputed it, and it was 
brought to a hearing before the Chinese judge of the place. 
To give him his due, he acted with a great deal of prudenos 
and impartiality ; •and, having heard both eides, he g^velj 
tsked the Chinese man that went with me to buy the camel

f bose servant he was ? I am no servant, says \e, I fti wen< 
<ith the stranger. — At whose request ? sayii the justice. 
U the stranger's request, says he. Why, then, says the 
ostice, you were the stranger's servant for the time ; and 
he camel being delivered to his servant, it was delivered to 
lim, and he must pay for it. 

I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not a word t< 
jay : bt*, admiring to see such just reasoning upon the con 
iequenc*\ and an accurate stating of the case, I paid wil- 
lingly fcr the camel, and sent for another; but, you may 
observe, I did not go to fetch it myself any more, for 1 had 
had enor.gh of that. 

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese empire , 
they call it fortified, and, so it is, as fortifications go there ; 
for this I will venture to affirm, that all the Tartars in Kara- 
kathay, which, I believe, are some millions, could not batter 
down the walls with their bows and arrows ; but to call it 
strong, if it were attacked with cannon, would be to make 
those who understand it laugh at you 

We wanted, as I have said, above two days' journey of 
this city, when, messengers were sent express to every part 
of the road to tell all travellers and caravans to halt till they 
had a guard sent for them ; for that an unusual body of 
Tartars, making ten thousand in all, had appeared in the 
way, about thirty miles beyond the city. 

This was very bad news to travellers ; however, it was 
carefully done of the governor, and we were very glad to 
hear we "should have a guard. Accordingly two days af\er, 
we had two hundred soldiers sent us from a garrison of the 
Chinese, on our left, and three hundred more from the city 
of Naum, and with these we advanced boldy ; the three 
hundred soldiers from Naum marched in our front, the two 
hundred in our rear, and our men on each side of qui 
camels, with our baggage, and the whole caravan in this 
•entre : in this order, and well prepared for battle, w»

tuought ourselves a match for the whole ten thousasd Mo 
gui Tartars, if they had appeared ; but the next day, whefi 
tiiey did appear, it was quite another thing. 

It was early in the morning, when, marching from a weL 
situated little town, called Changu, we had a river to pats, 
which we were ohliged to ferry ; and, had the Tartars had 
any intelligence, then had been the time to have attacked U8« 
when the caravan being over, the rear guard was behind ; 
but they did not appear there. About three hours after, 
when we were entered upon a desert of about sixteen miles 
over, behold, by a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an 
enemy was at hand; and they were at hand, indeed, for 
they came on upon the spur. 

The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had talked so 
big the day before, began to stagger ; and the soldiers fre- 
quently looked behind them, which is a certa'n sign in a 
soldier that he is just ready to run away. My old pilot was 
j'i my mind ; and, being near me, called out, Senhor Inglese, 
says he, those fellows must be encouraged, or they will ruin 
us all ; for if the Tartars come on, they will never stand it. 
— I. am of your mind, said I; but what must be done? — 
Done ! says he, let fifty of our men advance, and fiank them 
on each wing, and encourage them ; and they will fight like 
brave fellows in brave company ; but, without this, they will 
ivery man turn his back. Immediately I rode up to out 
leader, and told him, who was exactly ^f our mind : and 
Accordingly fifty of us marched to the right wing, and fifty 
(o the left, and the rest made a line of rescue ; and so we 
inarched, leaving the last two hundred men to make a body 
by themselves, and to guard the camels ; only that, if need 
were, they should send a hundred men to assbt the last 
fifty. 

Id a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable com- 
pany they were: how many we could not tell, but tea

firont of our line ; and, as we found them within gun-shou 
our leader ordered the two wings to advance swiftly, ana 
give them a salvo on each wing with their shot, which wa« 
done ; but they went off, and I suppose back, to give an ac- 
count of the reception they were likely to meet with ; and 
indeed, that salute cloyed their stomachs, fcr they immedi- 
At dy halted, stood awhile to consider of it, and wheeling of! 
to the left, they gave over their design, and said no more to 
us for *hat time ; which was very agreeable to our circum- 
Btancea which were but very indifferent for a battle with 
f ucli a number. 

Two days after we carne to the city of Naun, or Naum • 
we thanked the governor for his care of us, and collected to 
the value of a hundred crowns, or thereabouts, which he 
gave to the soldiers sent to guard us ; and here we ^ested 
one day. This is a garrison, indeed, and there were nine 
hundred soldiers kept here ; but the reason of it was, that 
formerly the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than they 
now do, the Muscovites having abandoned that part of the 
country, which lies from this city west for about two hun- 
dred miles, as desolate and unfit for use ; and more 
especially being so very remote, and so difficult to send 
troops thither for its defence : for we had yet above two 
thousand miles to Muscovy, properly so called. 

After this we passed several great rivers, and two dreadfiL. 
aeserts ; one of which we were sixteen days passing over , 
and which, as I said, was (^ be called no man*s land ; and, 
on the 1.3th of April, we came to the frontiers of the Musco- 
nte dominions. I think the first town, or fortress, which- 
ever it may be called, that belonged to the czar of Mus- 
covy, was called Argima, being on the west side of the rivet 
Arguna. 

I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction that I wat 
10 t^on arrived in, as I called it, a Christian country, or, a1

le^st, in a country governed by Christians; fi>r <aong^li the 
Muscovites do, in my opinion, but just deserve the name o' 
Christians, yet such they pretend to be, and are very devout 
in their way. It would certainly occur to any man whc 
travels the world as I have done, and who had any power of 
reflection, lyhat a blessing it is to be broug&t into the world 
where the name of Qod and a Redeemer is known, adored and 
worshipped ; and not where the people, given up by Heaven 
to strong delusions, worship the devil, and prostrate them- 
selves to stocks and stones ; worship monsters, elements, 
horrid-shaped animals, and statues or images ,of monsters. 
Not a town or city we passed through but had their pagods, 
their idols, and their temples, and ignorant people worship- 
ping even the works of their own hands. Now we came 
where, at least, a face of the Christian worship appeared ; 
where the knee was bowed to Jesus ; and whether igno- 
rantly or not, yet the Christian religion was owned, and the 
name of the true God was called upon and adored, and it 
made my soul rejoice to see it. I saluted the brave Scots 
merchant I mentioned above with my flrst acknowledgment 
of this ; and taking him by the hand, I said to him. Blessed 
be Ood, we are once again among Christians. He smiled, 
and answered. Do not rejoice too soon, countryman ; these 
Muscovites are but an odd sort of Christians ; and but for 
the name of it, you may see very littie of the substance for 
some months farther of our journey. - Well, says I, but still 
it is better than paganism and worshipping of devils. — 
Wliy, I will tell you, says he, etcept *he Riibsian .soldier in 
the garrisons, ar.d a few of the inhabitants of the cities upo»

We were now launched into the greatest piece of solid 
earth, if I understand anything of the surface of the globe, 
that is to be found in any part of the world ; we had, at 
least, twelve thousand miles to the sea, eastward ; two 
thousand to the bottom of the Baltic sea, westward ; and 
above three thousand, if we left that sea and went on west, 
to the British and French channels ; we had full five thous- 
and miles to the Indian or Persian sea, south ; and about 
eight hundred to the Frozen sea, north. Nay, if some 
people may be believed, there might be no sea, northeast, 
till we came round the pole, and consequently into the north- 
west, and so had a continent of land into America, the Lord 
knows where ; though 1 could give some reasons why I be- 
^eved that to be a mistake. 

As we entered into the Muscovite dominions a good while 
before we came to any considerable towns, we had nothing 
to observe there but this : first, that all the rivers run to the 
east : as I understood by the charts, which some in our car- 
avan had with them, it was plain all those rivers ran into the 
great river Yamour, or Amour ; which river, by the natural 
coarse of it, must run into the East sea, or Chinese Ocean 
The story they tell us, that the mouth of this river is choked 
ap with bulrushes of a monstrous growth, viz., three feet 
aboutf and twenty or thirty feet high, I must be allowed to 
•ay, I. believe rothing of it ; but, as its navigation is of IM

use, because there is no trade that way, the Tartars, to \(honi 
t alone belongs, dealing m nothing but cattle, so nobody, 
that ever I heard of, has been curious enough either to go 
down to the mouth of it in boats, or come up from the 
mouth of it in ships, as far as I can find : but this is certain, 
that this river running east, in the latitude of about fifty de- 
greet, carries a vast concourse of rivers along with it, and 
finds an ocean to empty itself in that latitude : so we are 
sure of sea there. 

Some leagues to the north of this river there are several 
considerable rivers, whose streams run as due north as the 
Yamour runs east, and these are all found to join their 
waters with the great river Tartarus, named so from the 
northermost nations of the Mogul Tartars ; who, as the Chi- 
nese say, were the first Tartars in the world ; and who, as 
• our geographers allege, are the Gog and Magog mentioned 
in sacred story. These rivers running all northward, as well 
as all the other rivers I am yet to speak of, make it evident 
that the northern ocean bounds the land also on that side ; 
io that it does not seem rational in the least to think that 
the land can extend itself to join with America on that side, 
or that there is not a communication between the northern 
and eastern ocean : but of this I shall say no more ; it was 
my observation at that time, and therefore I take notice of li 
in this place. 

We now advanced from the river Arguna by easy and 
moderate journeys, and were very visibly obliged to the care 
the Czar of Muscovy has taken to have cities and towns 
built in as many places as it is possible to place them, where 
his soldiers keep garrison, something like the stationary 
soldiers placed by the Romans in the remotest countries ol 
their empire ; some of which that I had read of were placed 
in Britain, for the security of commerce, and for the lodging 
travellers; and thus it was here: for wherever ^^e cama 
.hough at thi)s^ towns and stations the garrisons and govei^

ori wttt Russian and professed Christians, yet the inhab' 
Itants were mere pagans ; sacrificing to idols, and worship- 
ping the sun, moon, and stars, or all the host of heaven ; 
and not only so, but were, of all the heathens and 
pagans that ever I met with, the most barbarous, except 
only that they did not eat men's flesh, as our savages ol 
America did. "» 

Some instances of this we met within the country between 
Arguna, where we enter the MuscovUe dominions, and a city 
of Tartars and Russians together, called Nertzinskoi, in 
which is a continued desert or forest, which cost us twenty 
day^ to travel over. In a village, near the last of these 
places, I had the curiosity to go and see their way of living, 
which is most brutish and insufferable ; they had, I suppose, 
a great sacrifice that day ; for there stood out, upon an old 
stump jof a tree, an idol made of wood, frightful as the 
devil; at least, al any thing we can think of to represent 
the devil can be made : it had a head not so much as re- 
sembling any creature that the world ever saw ; ears as big 
as goats' horns, and as high ; eyes as big as a crown piece ; 
1 nose like a crooked ram's-hom, an4 a mouth extended 
four-cornered, like that of- a lion, with horrible teeth, hooked 
like a parrot's under-bill : it was dressed up in the filthiest 
manner that you could suppose : its upper garment was ol 
sheep-skins, with the wool outward; a "great Tartar bonnet 
on the head, with two horns growing through it : it was 
about eight feet high, yet had no feet or legs, nor anj othet 
proportion of parts. 

This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village , 
And, when I came near to it, there were sixteen or seventeeih 
creatures, whether men or women I could not tell, for they 
nade no distinction by their habits, all lyiKg fiat upon ths 
ground round this formidable block of shapeless wood : I 
taw no motion among them any more than if they haul been 
kU )g9 of wood, like the idol, and at first I really thought 



|9g ADVENTURES OF 

cbey uad been so ; but, when I came a little aeaier, thty 
ilMled up upon their feet, and raised a howling cry, as if il 
had been so many deep-mouthed hounds, and walked away, 
as if they were displeased at our dbturbing them. A little 
way off from the idol, and at the door of a tent or hut, 
made all of sheep-skins and cow-skins dried, stood throe 
butchers, — I thbught they were such : when I came nearex 
to them, I found they had long knives in their hands ; and in 
the middle of the tent appeared three sheep killed, and one 
young bullock or steer. These, it seems, were s*. orifices to 
that senseless log of an idol ; the three men were priests be- 
longing to it, and the seventeen prostrated wretches were 
the people who brought the offering, and were making their 
prayers to that stock. 

I confess, 1 was more moved at their stupidity and brutish 
worship of a hobgoblin than ever I was at anything in my 
life ; to see God's most glorious and best creature, to whom 
he nad granted so many advantages, even by creation above 
the rest of the works of his hands, vested with a reasonable 
Boul, and that soul adorned mth faculties and capacities 
adapted both to honor yhis Maker, and be honored by him, 
sunk and degenerated to a degree so very stupid as to pros- 
trate itself to a frightful nothing, a mere imaginary object, 
dressed up by themselves, and made terrible to themselves 
by their own contrivance, adorned only with clouts and rags ; 
and that this should be the effect of mere ignorance, wrought 
up into hellish devotion by the devil himself; who, envying 
to his Maker the homage and adoration of his creatures, had 
deluded them into such sordid and brutish things as out 
w^uld think should shock nature itself ! 

But what signified all the astonishment and reflection oi 
thoughts : thus it was, and 1 saw it before my eyes, and 
there was no room to wonder at it, or think it impossible : 
all my admiration turned to rage, and I rode up to the image 
or monster, call it what you will, and with my sword mads

k stroke at the bonnet that was on its head, and cut it il tiwo ; 
and one oi* our men that was with me took hold of the sheep* 
skin that covered it, and pulled at it ; when, behold, a mosl 
hideous outcry and howling ran through the village, and two 
or three hundred people came about my ears, so that I was 
glad to scour for it, for we saw some had bows and arrows ; 
but I resolved from that moment to visit theip again. 

Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was 
about four miles off, in order to provide some horses which 
they wanted, several of the horses having been lamed and 
*aded with the badness of the way, and long march over the 
ast desert ; so we had some leisure here to put my design 
kU execution. I communicated my design to the Scots 
merchant of Moscow, of whose courage I had sufficient tes- 
timony : I told him what I had seen, and with what indig- 
nation I had since thought that human nature could be so 
degenerate ; I told him, if I could get but four or five men 
well armed, to go with me, I was resolved to go and destroy 
that vile, abominable idol, and let them see that it had no 
power to help itself; and consequently could not be an ob- 
ject of worship, or to be prayed to, much less help them 
that offered sacrifices to it. 

He laughed at me : — says he. Your zeal may be good 
but what dc you propose to yourself by it ? — Propose ! said 
I ; to vindicate the honor of. God, which is insulted by this 
devil-worship. — But how will it vindicate the honor ol 
God, said he, while the people will not be able to know 
what you mean by it, unless you could speak to them, and 
tell them so ? And then they will fight you, and beat you 
too, ril assure you ; for they are desperate fellows, and that 
especially in defence of their idolatry. — Can we not, said I, 
do it in the night, and then leave them the reasons and the 
causes in writing in their own language ? — Writing ! said 
he ; why there is not a man in five nations of them tha* 
knows anything of a letter, or how to read a word any way 



800 ADVENTUEE8 Ot 

— Wretched ignorance ! said I to him : howerer, I h^ve a 
great mind to do it ; perhaps nature may draw inferencea 
from it to them, to let them see how brutish they are to wor- 
ship such horrid things. — Liook you, sir, said he, if your 
zeal prompts you to it so warmly, you must do it ; but, in 
^he next place, I wo\ild have you consider, these wild nations 
of people are subjected by force to the Czar of Musdovy's 
dominion, and you do this, it is ten to one but they will 
come by thousands to the governor of Nertzinskoi, and de- 
mand satisfaction ; and if he cannot give them satisfaction, 
•t is ten to one but they revolt ; and it will occasion a new 
war with all the Tartars in the country. 

This, I confess, put new thoughts into my hand for awhile, 
but I harpod upon the same string still ; and all that day I 
was uneasy to put my project in execution. Towards the 
evening the Scots merchant met me by accident in our walk 
about the town, and desired to speak with me : I believe, 
said he, I have put you off your good design ; I have been 
a little concerned about it since : for I abhor idolatry ai 
much as you can do. — Truly, scdd I, you have put it off a 
little, as to the execution of it, but you have not put it out 
of my thoughts ; and I believe I shall do it before I quit 
this place, though I were to be delivered up to them for 
satisfaction. — No, no, said he, God forbid they should 
deliver you up to such a crew of monsters i They shall not 
do that neither ; that would be murdering you indeed. — 
Why, said I, how would they use me ? — Use you ! said he, 
ril tell you how they served a poor Russian, ^ho affronted 
them in their worship, just as you did, and whom they took 
prisoner, after they had lamed him mth an arrow, that he 
could not run away : they took him and stripped him stark- 
naked, and set him upon the top of the idol-monster, and 
•tood all round him, and shot as many arrows into him ae 
would stick over his whole body ; and then they burnt him. 
wid all the arrows sticking in him, as a «acr7fi »e *^^ *he 'dol. 



ROBINSON CmjSOE. 60a 

— And was this the same idol? said 1. Yes, feaid he, th'! 
very same. — Well, said I, I will tell you a story. So 1 
related the story of our men at Madagascai, and how they 
burnt and sacked the village there, and killed man, woman, 
and child, for their murdering one of our men, just as it is 
f^lated before ; and I added, that I thought we ought to d'-. 
so to this village. 

He listened very attentively to the story; but when ] 
talked of doing so to that village, said he, You mistake very 
much ; it was not this village, it was almost a hundred miles 
from this place ; but it was the same idol, for they carry him 
about in procession all over the country. — Well, said 1, 
then that idol ought to be punished for it ; and it shall., 
said I, if I live this night out. 

In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the design, and 
told me I should not go alone, but he would go with me, 
but he would go first and bring a stout fellow, one of his 
countrymen, to go also with us : and one, said he, as famous 
for his zeal as you can desire any one to be against such 
devilish things as these. In a word, he brought me his 
comrade, a Scotsman, whom he called Captain Richardson ; 
and gav3 him a full account of what I had seen, and also 
what I int3nded ; and he told me readily, he would go with 
me if it cost him his life. So we agreed to go, only we 
three. I had, indeed, proposed it to my partner, but he 
declined it. He said, he was ready to assist me to the 
utmost, and upon all occasions, for my defence ; but this 
was an adventure quite out of his way : so, I say, w^ 
resolved upon our work, only we three and my man-servant, 
ar/d to put it in execution that night about midnight, with 
all the secrecy imaginable. 

However, upon second thoughts, we were willing to delay 
it till the next night, because, the caravan being to set for- 
ward in the morning, we supposed the governor could QOt 
^eter.d to give t) em any satisfaction upon us when we vert

out of his power. The Scots merchant, as steady in h'u 
resolution for the enterprise as bold in executing, brought 
me a Tartar's robe or gown of sheep-skins, and a bonnet, 
with a bow and arrows, and had provided the same for him- 
self and his countryman, that the people, if they daw us, 
•ihould not determine who we were. 

All the first night we spent in mixing up some combusti- 
ble matter with aqua vitae, gunpowder, and sucn other 
materials as we could get ; and, having a good quantity of 
tar in a little pot, about an hour after night we set out upon 
our expedition. 

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and 
found that the people had not the least jealousy of danger 
attending their idol. The night was cloudy ; yet the moon 
gave us light enough to see that the idol stood just in the 
same posture and place that it did before. The people 
seemed to be all at their rest ; only, that in the great hut, or 
tent, as we called it, where we saw the three priests whom 
we mistook for butchers, we saw a light ; and going up close 
to the door, we heard people talking as if there were Rye or 
six of them ; we concluded, therefore, that if we set wildfire 
to the idol, these men would come out immediately, and run up 
to the place to rescue it from the destruction that we intended 
for it ; and what to do with them we knew not. Once we 
thought of tairying it away and setting fire to it at a dis- 
tance, but when we came to handle it, we found it too 
Ij ilky for our carriage ; so we were at a loss again. The 
«.cund Scotsman was for setting fire to the tent or hut» 
dud knocking the creatures that were there on the head, 
(\ hen they came out ; but I could not join with that ; I wai 
avfainst killing them, if it were possible to avoid it. Well, 
ihen, said the Scots merchant, I will tell you what we will 
ilo : ve will try to make them prisoners, tie their hands, ind 
s ake them stand and see their idol destroyed. 

iL% it happened, we had twine or packthread enough aboiH 



IIOBINSON CRUSOE. g3^ 

08, which '^ 3 used to tie our firelocks altogether wito : m 
ire resolved to attack these people first, and with as little 
noise as we could. The first thing we did, we knocked a^ 
the door, when, one of the priests coming to it, we immedi- 
ately seized upon him, stopped his mouth, and tied his handi 
Dehind him, and led him to the idol, where we gagged him 
that he might not make a noise, tied his feet also togethei, 
and left him on the ground. 

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that anothei 
would come out, to see what the matter was : hut we waited 
lo long till the third man came hack to us ; and then no- 
body coming out, we knocked again gently, and immediately 
out came two more, and we served them just in the same 
manner, but were obliged to go all with them, and lay them 
down by the idol some distance firom one another ; when, 
going back, we found two more were come out to the door, 
and a third stood behind them within the door. We seized 
the two, and immediately tied them, when the third stepping 
back, and crying out, my Scots merchant went in after him 
taking out a composition we had made, that would only 
smoke and stink, he set fire to it and threw it in among them : 
by that time the other Scotsman and my man, taking charge 
of the two men already bound, and tied together also by the 
arm, led them away to the idol, and left them there to see ii 
their idol w^d relieve them, making haste back to us. 

When the furze we had thrown in had filled the hut with 
•o much smoke that they were almost suffocated, we then 
threw in a small leather bag of another kind, which fiamed 
like a candle, and following it in, we found there were but 
four people, and, as we supposed, had been about some oi 
their diabolical sacrifices. They appeared, in short, fright- 
tned to death, at least so as to sit trembling and stupid, 
fend not able to speak neither, for the smoke. 

In a word, we took them, bound them as we had done the 
•thers, and all irithout any noise. I should lia^e said we 



((04 ADVENTURES OF 

brought them out of the house, or hut, firs ; for indeed w« 
wer) not able to bear the smoke any more than they were. 
When we had done this, we carried them altogether to the 
ido^ when we came there we fell to work with him ; and 
firs* we daubed him all over, and his robes also, with tar, 
and such other stuff as we had, which was tallow mixed with 
brimstone : then we stopped his eyes and ears and mouth 
full of gunpowder ; then we wrapped up a great piece oi 
wildfire in his bonnet ; and then sticking all the com- 
bustibles we had brought with us upon him, we looked 
about to see if we could find anything else to help to bum 
him ; when my Scotsman remembered that by the tent, ox 
hut, where the men were, there lay a heap of dry forage, 
whether straw or rushes I do not remember; away he and 
the other Scotsman ran and fetched their arms full of that. 
When we had done this, we took all our prisoners, and 
brought them, having untied their feet and ungagged their 
mouths, and made them stand up, and set them before their 
monstrous idol, and then set fire to the whole. 

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts, till 
the powder in the eyes and mouth and ears of the idol blew 
up, and, as we could perceive, had split and deformed the 
shape of it : and, in a word, till we saw it burned into a 
mere block or log of wood ; and setting dry fomge to it, we 
found it would be soon quite consumed ; soWe began to 
think of going away : but the Scotsman said. No, we must 
Aot go, for these poor deluded wretches will all throw them- 
selves into the fire, and bum themselves with the idol. So 
we resolved to stay till the forage was burnt down too, and 
(hen came away and left them. 

After the feat was performed, we appeared in the morning 
am)ng our fellow travellers, exceeding busy in getting ready 
^r our journey ; nor could any man suggest that we had 
been any where but in our beds, as travellert might hf

nipposcd to 1h', to fit themselves for the fatigues of the day*i 
journey. 

But the affair did not end so : the next day came a great 
!i imber of the country people to the town gates, and in 8 
most outrageous manner demanded satisfaction of the Hu& 
tian governor for the insulting their priests, and burning 
their Cham Chi-Thaungu. The people of Nertzinskoi weie 
at first in a great consternation, for they said the Tartais 
were already no less than thirty thousand strong. The Rub* 
sian governor sent out messengers to appease them, and gave 
them all the good words imaginable ; assuring them that he 
knew nothing of it, and that there had not a soul in his gar- 
rison been abroad, so that it co\ild not be from anv body 
there ; but if they could let him know who did it, they 
should be exemplarily punished. They returned haughtily, 
that all the country reverenced the great Cham Chi-Thaun- 
gu, who dwelt in the sun, and no mortal would have dared 
to offer violence to his image but some Christian miscreant ; 
and they therefore resolved to denounce war against him 
and all the Russians, who, they said, were miscreants and 
Christians. 

The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make a 
breach, or to have any cause of war alleged to be given by 
Lim, the O^tt having strictly charged them to treat the con- 
quered souroy with gentleness and civility, gave them still 
all the good words he could. At last he told them there was 
a caravan gone towards Russia that morning, and perhaps it 
was some of them who had done them this injury ; and that 
if they would be satisfied with that, he would send after 
them to inquire into it. This seemed to appease them a 
little ; and accordingly the governor sent after us, and gave 
ds a particular account how the thing was ; intimating 
withal, that if any in our caravan had done it, they should 
feiake their escape ; but that, whether we had done it or no^ 
61* 



506 ADVENTURES OF 

we should make all the haste forward that was possible ; and 
that, in the mean time, he would keep them in play as long 
as he could. 

This was very friendly in the governor : however, when il 
came to the caravan, there was nobody knew anything of thf 
matter ; and as for h3 that were guilty, we were least of all 
suspected. However, the captain of the caravan for the 
time took the hint that the governor gave us, and we trav- 
elled two days and two nights without any considerable stop, 
and then we lay at a village called Plothus : nor did we 
make any long stop here, but hastened on towards Jarawena, 
another of the czar of Muscovy's colonies, and where we 
expectifl we should be safe. But upon the second day's 
march from Plothus, by the clouds of dust behind us at a 
great dbtance, some of our people began to be sensible we 
were pursued. We had entered a great desert, and had 
parsed by a great lake called Schaks Oser, when we per- 
ceived a very great body of horse appear on the other side of 
the lake, to the north, we travelling west. We observed 
they went away west, as we did, but had supposed we would 
have taken that side of the lake, whereas we very happily 
took the south side ; and in two days more they disappeared 
again : for they, believing we were still before them, pushed 
on till they came to the river Udda, a very gxgj^river when 
it passes farther north, but when we came to iP^e found it 
narrow and fordable. 

The third day, they had either found their mistake, or had 
intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us towards the 
dusk of the evening. We had, to Our great satisfaction, 
just pitched upon a place for our camp, which was very con- 
venient for the night ; for as we were upon a desert, though 
but at the beginning of it, that was above five hundred mil^ 
tver, we had no towns to lodge at, and, indeed, expected 
loiM but the city Jarawena, which we had yet ^o dnyt

on this side, and little rivers, which ran all into the great 
river Udda ; it was in a narrow strait, between little but 
very thick woods, that we pitched our little camp for that 
aight, expecting to be attacked before morning. 

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued foi : 
but as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go about in 
troops in that desert, so the caravans always fortify them* 
selves every night against them, as against armies of rob- 
bcrs ; and it was therefore no new thing to be pursued. 

But we had this night, of all the nights of our travels, a 
most advantageous camp ; for we lay between two woods, 
with a little rivulet running just before our front, so that we 
could not be surrounded, or attacked any way but in our 
front or rear. We took care also to make our front as strong 
as we could, by placing our packs, with our camels and 
horses,»all in a line on the inside of the river, and felling 
some trees in our rear. 

In this posture we encamped for the night ; but the enemy 
was upon us before we had finished our situation. They 
did not come on us like thieves, as we expected, but sent 
three messengers to us, to demand the men to be delivered 
to them that had abtrsed their priests, and burned their god 
Cham Chi-Tlmingu with fire, that they might bum them 
with fire ; amr upon this, they said, they would go away, 
and do us no further harm, otherwise they would destroy us 
all. Our men looked very blank at this message, and began 
to stare at one another, to see who looked with the mos' 
guilt in their faces ; but, nobody was the word ; nobody did 
it. The leader of the caravan sent word he was well as- 
sured that it was not done by any of our camp ; that we 
were pjaceable merchants, travelling on our business ; that 
we haul done no harm to them or to any one else ; and that, 
therefore, tbey must look farther for their enemies who bad 



109 ADVENloKES UF 

mjured them, for we were not ^he people lo desiiei 
them not to disturb us, for, if they did, we should defend 
ourselves. 

Thej were far from being satisfied with this for an answer ; 
and a great crowd of them came running down in the mom* 
ing by break of day, to our camp ; but seeing us in such an 
anaccountable situation, they durst come no &rtiher than the 
brook in our front, where they stood, and showed us such a 
number that indeed terrified us very much : for those that 
spoke least of them spoke of ten thousand. Here they 
stood and looked at us awhile, and then setting up a great 
howl, they let fly a crowd of arrows among us ; but we were 
well enough fortified for that, for we sheltered under oiu 
baggage, and I dp not remember that one of us was hurt. 

Some time after thb, we saw them move a little to our 
ri^t, and expected them on the rear ; when a cunning fel- 
low, a Cossack of Jarawena, in the pay of the Museovites, 
calling to the leader of the caravan, said to him, I'll go send 
all these people away to Siheilka: tfiis was a city four or 
five days' journey at least to the right, and rather behind 
us. So he takes his bow and arrows, and getting on horse- 
back, he rides away from our rear directly, as it were back 
to Nertzinskoi; after this, he takes S great circuit about, 
and comes directly on the army of the Jbrtafs, as if 
he had been sent express to tell them a long^tory, that the 
people who had burned the Cham Chi-Thaungu were gone 
to Siheilka, with a caravan of miscreants, as he called them, 
that is to tay. Christians ; and that they had resolved to 
bum the god Schal-Isar, belonging to the Tongueses. 

As this fellow was himself a mere Tartar, and perfectly 
jpoke their language, he counterfeited so well, that they al] 
look it from him, and away they drove in a most violent 
hurry to ^heilka, which, it seems, was five days journey to 
the north ; and in less than three hours they were entirely 
Ml o^ oir nght, and we never heard any more of them, noi 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6^9 

whether they went to Siheilka or no. So we passed away 
•afely on to Jarawena, where there was a garrison of Musco- 
vites, and there we rested five days, the caravan being ex- 
ceedingly fatigued with the last day's hard march, and with . 
wunt of rest in the night. 

From this city we had a frighftil desert, which held us 
Iwenty-three days' march. We furnished ourselves with 
seme tents here, for the better accommodating ourselves in 
the night ; and the leader of the caravan procured sixteen 
carriages, or waggons of the country, for carrying our water 
3r provisions ; and these carriages were our defence, every 
night, round our little camp ; so that had* the Tartars ap- 
peared, unless they had been very numerous indeed; they 
would not have been able to hurt us. 

We may well be supposed to want rest again after thit^ 
long journey : for in this desert we neither saw house not 
tree, and scarce a bush ; though we saw abundance of the 
sable-hunters, who are all Tartars of the Mogul Tartary, o\ 
which this country is a part ; and they frequently attack 
small caravans, 'but we saw no numbers of them together. 

After we had passed this desert, we came into a country 
pretty well inhabited ; that is to say, we f^und our towns 
and castles, settled by the czar of Muscovy, with garrisoii.s 
of stationary soldiers, to protect the caravans, and defend 
the country aPiinst the Tartars, who would otherwise make 
it very dangerous travelling; and his czarish majesty has 
given such strict orders for the well guarding the caravuna 
and merchants, that if there are any Tartars heard of In the 
country, detachments of the garrisons are always sent to sec. 
the travellers safe from station to station. And tiius the* 
governor of Adinskoy, whom I had an opportunity to make 
a visit to, by means of the Scots merchant, who was ac- 
quainted with him, o^red us a guard of fifty men, if we 
lliought there was any danger, to the next station. 

I thought, long before this, that as we came nearar xm 



110 ADVENTURES OF 

Europe wo should find the country better inhabited, and tiM 
people more civilizad ; but I found myself mistaken in both : 
for we had yet the nation of the Tongueses to pass through^ 
where we saw the same tokens of paganism and barbarity as 
before ; only as they were conquered by the Muscovites, 
they were not so dangerous ; but *for rudeness of manners, 
%nd idolatry, no people in the world ever went beyond them : 
they are clothed all in skins of beasts, and their houses are 
built of the same ; you know not a man from a woman, 
neither by the' ruggedness of their countenances nor their 
dothes ; and in the winter, when the ground is covered with 
snow, they live Underground in vaults, which have ca\-i- 
ties going from one to another. 

If the Tartars had their Cham Chi-Th«ngu for a whole 
village or country, these had idols in every hut and every 
cave, besides, they worship the stars, the sun, the water, the 
snow, and, in a word, every thing they do not understand, 
and they understand but very little ; so that every element, 
every uncommon thing, sets them a sacrificing. I met with 
nothing peculiar to myself in all this country*, which I reckon 
was, from the desert I spoke of last, at least four hundred 
miles, half of it being another desert, which took us up 
twelve days' severe travelling, without house or tree ; and 
we were obliged. again to carry our own provisions, as well 
water as bread. After we were out of trns desert, and 
had travelled two days, we came to Janezay, a Musco- 
vite city or station on the great river Janezay (Yemsey), 
which, they told us there, parted Europe from Asia. 

Here I observed ignorance and paganism still prevailed, 
^txcept in the Muscovite garrisons ; all the country between 
the river Oby and the river Janezay is as entirely pagan, and 
the people as barbarous, as the remotest of the Tartars ; 
uay, as any nation, for aught I know, in Asia or America. 1 
ilso found, which I observed to the Muscovite governors 
whom I had an opportunity to converse with, that the poof 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 61 j 

pagaai aie not much wiser, or near Christianity, for being 
ander the Muscovite government ; which they acknowledged 
was true enough : but that, as they said, was none* of theii 
business ; that if the czar expected to convert his Siberian, 
Tonguese, or Tartar subjects, it should be done by sending 
clerg3rman among them, not soldiers : and, they added, with 
mc re sincerity than I expeti^ed, that they found it was not 
yo much the concern of their monarch to make the people 
Christians as it was to make them subjects. 

From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed a wild 
uncultivated country, barren of people and good manage* 
ment ; otherwise it is in itself a most pleasant, fruitful, and 
agreable country. What inhabitants we found in it are all 
pagans, except such as are sent among them from Russia : 
for this is the country, I mean on both sides the river Oby, 
whither the Muscovite criminals that are not put to death 
are banished, and from whence it is next to impossible they 
should ever come away. 

I have nothing to say of my particular affairs till I came 
io Tobolski, the capital city of Siberia, where T continued 
some time on the following occasion. 

We had now been almost seven months on our journey, 
and winter began to come on apace ; whereupon my partnei 
and I called a council about our particular affairs, in which, 
we found it proper, as we were bound for England, and not 
for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of ourselves. They 
told us of sledges and reindeer to carry us over the snow in 
the winter time ; and, indeed, they have such things that it 
would be incredible to relate the particulars of, by which 
means the Russians travel more in the winter than they can 
in summer, as in these sledges they are able to run night 
and day ; the snow being frozen, is one universal covering 
to nature, by which the hills, vales, rivers, and lakes are all 
•mooth and hard as a stone, and they run upon the surface 
without any regard to what is underneath. 



112 ADVENTURES Of 

Bat I kad no occasion to push at a w nter journey of thu 
kind ; I was bound to England, not to Moscow, and my 
route lay two ways : either I must go on as tne caravan 
went, till I came to Jaroslaw, and then go off west for Narva, 
and the g^lf of Finland, and so to Dantzic, where I migh 
possibly sell my China cargo to good advantage ; or I must 
leave the caravan at a little town on the Dwina, from whence 
I had but six days by water to Archangel, and from thence 
might be sure of shipping either to England, Holland, or 
Hamburgh. 

Now, to go any of these journeys in the winter would 
have been preposterous : for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would 
have been frozen up, and I could not get passage ; and to go 
by land in those countries was far less safe than among the 
Mogul Tartars : likewise, to go to Archangel in October, all 
ihe ships would be gone from thence, and even the merchants 
who dwell there in summer retire south to Moscow in the 
winter, when the ships are gone ; so that I could have 
nothing but extremity of cold to encounter, with a scarcit} 
of provisions, and must lie in an empty town all the winter : 
BO that, upon the whole, I thought it much my better way 
to let the caravan go, and make provision to winter where 
I was, at Tobolski, in Siberia, in the latitude of about sixty 
degrees, where I was sure of three things to wear out a cold 
winter with, viz., plenty of provisions, such as jthe country 
afforded, a warm house, with fuel enough, and excellent 
company. 

I was now in a quite different clinmte from my beloved 
iiland, where I never felt cold, except when I had my ague ; 
on the contrary, 1 had much to do to bear any clothes on 
my back, and never made any fire but without doors, which 
wa« necessary for dressing my food, &^. Now I made 
me three good vests, with large robes or gown o^er them, 
W hang down to the feet, and button close to the w:ifti* 



UOBINSON CRUSOE. f|« 

and all these lined with furs, to make them sufficienili 
wann. 

As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly disliked 
ou$ way in England of making fires in every room in the 
house in open chimneys, which, when the fire was outji 
always kept the air in the room cold as the climate ; bat 
taking an apartment in a good house in the town, I ordered 
a chimney to be built like a furnace, in the centre of six 
several rooms, like a stove ; the funnel to carry the smoke 
went up one way, the door to come at the fire went in 
anotner, and all the rooms were kept equally warm, but no 
fire seen, just as they heat the bagnios in England. By this 
meansj we had always the same climate in all the rooms, 
and an equal heat was preserved ; and how cold soever it 
was without, it was always warm within : and yet we saw 
no fire, nor were ever incommoded with smoke. 

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be 
possible to meet with good company here, in a country so 
barbarous as that of the most northerly parts of Europe, 
near the frozen ocean, within but a very few degrees of Nova 
Zembla. But this being the country where the state crim- 
inals of Muscovy, as I observed before, are all banished, 
this city was full of noblemen, gentlemen, soldiers, and 
courtiers of^ Muscovy. Here was the famous prince Gal- 
litzen, the old general Robostiski, and several other perbons 
of ||ote, and some ladies. By imeans of my Scots merchant, 
whom, nevertheless, I parted with here, I made an acquaint- 
ance with several of these gentlemen ; and from these, in 
the long winter nights in which* I stayed here, I received 
several very agreeable visits. 

It was talking one night with Prince , one of the 

banished ministers of state belonging to the czar of Mus- 
covy, that the discourse of my particular case began. He 
oad beei telling me abundanca of fine things of the great- 
52 



514 ADVBNTUEBS OF 

aesSf tke magnificence, the dominions, and the ahsoluU 
power of the emperor of the Russians : I interrupted him, 
and told him I was a greater and more powerful prince than ' 
even the czar of Muscovy was, though mj domimons were 
not 80 large, or mj people so many. The Russian grandee 
looked a little surprised, and fixing his eyes steadily upon 
me, began to wonder what I meant. I told him his' wonder 
would cease when I: had explained myself; First, 1 told him 
I had absolute disposal of the lives and fortunes of all my 
subjects ; that, notwithstanding my absolute power, I had 
not one person disaffected to my government, or to my per- 
son, in all dominions. He shook his head at that, and said. 
There, indeed, I outdid the czar of Muscovy. I told him 
that all the lands in my kingdom were my own, and all my 
subjects were not' only my tenants, but tenants at will; that 
they would all fight for me to the last drop ; and that never 
tyrant, for such I acknowledged myself to be, was ever so 
universally beloved, and yet so^hoi^bly feared by his sub- 
jects. 

After amusing him with these riddles in government for a 
while, I opened the case, and told him the story at large oi 
my living in the island ; and how I managed both myself 
and the people that were under me, just as I have since 
minuted it down. They were exceedingly taken with the 
story, and especially the prince, who told me with a sigh, 
that the ^ue greatness of life was to be masters of o\u selves; 
dmt he would not have exchanged such a state of life as 
mine to be czar of Muscovy ; and that he found more felicity 
in the retirement he seemed to be banished to there, than 
ever he found in the highest authority he enjoyed in the 
court of his master the czar ; that the height of human wis- 
dom was to bring our tempers down to our circumstances, 
and to make a calm within, under the weight of the greatest 
itorms without. When h 3 came first. hither, he sai^ ne used 
to tear the hair firom his head, and the clothes "rom hia 



ROBINSON CRUeOB. 611 

l^ack, as others had done before him ; but a little ime and 
»3nsideration had made him look into himself, as well aa 
round him, to things without : that he found the mind ol 
man, if it was but once brought to reflect upon the state of 
universal life, and how little this world was concerned in its 
true felicity, was perfectly capable of making a felicity foi 
itself, fully satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own best 
ends and desires, with but very little assistance from the 
irorld : the air to breathe in, food to sustain life, clothes foi 
warmth, and liberty for exercise, in order to health, com- 
pleted, in his opinion, all that the world could do for us ; 
and though the greatness, the authority, ffie riches, and the 
pleasures which some enjoyed in the world, had much in them 
that was agreeable to us, yet all those things chiefly gratified 
Uie coarsest of our affections, such as our ambition, our 
particular pride, avarice, vanity, and sensuality ; all which, 
being the mere product of the worst part of man, were in 
themselves crimes, and had in them the seeds of all manner 
of crimes ; but neither were related to, nor concerned with, 
any of those virtues that constituted us wise men, or of 
those graces that distinguished us as Christians ; that being 
now deprived of all the fancied felicity which he enjoyed in 
the fiill exercise of all those vices, he said he was at leisure 
to look apnn the dark side of them, where he found all man- 
ner of deformity, and was now convinced that virtue onl) 
makes a man truly wise, rich, and great, and preserves him 
in the way to a superior happiness in a future state ; and in 
this, he said, they were more happy in their banishment thar 
all their enemies were, who had the full possession of all 
the wealth and power they had left behind them. Nor, sir, 
say^ he, do I bring my mind to this politically, by the neces- 
«ty of my circumstances, which some call miserable ; but, 
if I know any thing of myself, I would not now go back, 
lihough the czar -ny master should call me, and reinstate me 
in all my former grandeur ; T say, I would no more go back

to it than I believe my soul, when it shall be deliieied fronr 
this prison of the body, and has had a taste of the glorioof 
state beyond life, would come back to the gaol of flesh and 
blo)d it is now enclosed in, and leave heaven, to deal in the 
dirt and crime of human affairs. 

He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, so 
much earnestness and motion of his spirits, that it was 
evident it was the true sense of his soul; there was no 
room to doubt his sincerity. I told him I once thought 
myself a kind of monarch in my old station, of which I had 
given him an account ; but that I thought he was not only 
a monarch, but a great conqueror ; for that he that has got 
a victory over his own exorbitant desires, and the absolute 
dominion over himself, whose reason entirely governs his 
will, is certainly greater than he that conquers a city. But, 
my lord, said I, shall I take the liberty to ask you a ques- 
tion ? — With all my heart, says he. If the door of your 
liberty was opened, said I, would you not take hold of it to 
deliver you from this exile ? — Hold, said he, your question 
IS subtle, and requires some serious, just distinctions, to give 
it a sinpere answer ; and I will give it you from the bottom 
of my heart. Nothing that I know of in this world, would 
move me to deliver myself from this state of banishment, 
except these two ; first, the ei\joyment of my relations ; 
and, secondly, a little warmer climate : but I protest to you 
that to go back to the pomp of the court, the glory, the 
power, the hurry of a minister of state ; the wealth, the 
gaiety, and the pleasures of a courtier ; if my master should 
send me word this moment that he restores to me all h« 
banished me from, I protest, if I know myself at all, 1 
would not leave this wilderness, these deserts, and these 
frozen lakes, for the ^palace at Moscow. — But, my lord, 
said I, perhaps you not only are banished from the pleasures 
of the court, and fr^m the pow^, authority, and wealth you 
eigoyed befoi3, bu you ma; be absent too from some ol 



ROBINSON CRUSUB ^11 

Ibe convomences of life ; your estate, perhaps, or ifiscate^ 
und your effects plundered ; and the supplies left you here 
may not be suitable to the ordinary demands of life. — 
Ay, says he, that is as you suppose me to be a lord, or 1 
prince, &c. ; so, indeed, I am ; but you are now to considei 
me only as a man, a human creature, not at all distinguished 
from another; and so I can suffer no want, unless I should 
be visited with sickness and distempers. However, to put 
the question out of dispute, you see our manner : we are, 
in this place, five persons of rank ; we live perfectly retired, 
as suited to a state of banishment ; we have something 
rescued from the shipwreck of our fortunes, which keeps up 
from the mere necessity of hunting for food ; but the pool 
soldiers, who are here without that help, live in as much 
plenty as we, who go into the woods and catch sables and 
foxes : the laboring of a month will maintain them a year ; 
and, as the way of living is not expensive, so it is not 
hard to get sufficient to ourselves. So that objection is ou^ 
of doors. 

I have not room to give a full account )f the most agree- 
able conversation I had with this truly great man ; in all 
which he showed that his mind was so inspired with a 
superior knowledge of things, so supported by religion, as 
well as by a vast share of wisdom, that his contempt of the 
world was really as much as he had expressed, and that he 
was always the same to the last, as will appear in the story 
I am going to tell. 

I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful win 
ter I thought it ; the cold so intense that I could not so 
much as look abroad without being wrapped in furs, and a 
mask of fnr before my face, or rather a hood, with only a 
hole for breath, and two for sight : the little daylight ^e 
had was, as we reckoned, for three months, not above five 
houis a day, and six at most ; only that snow lying on the 
fround ccntinually, and the weather clear, it was never quitf 
52*

iLa]%. Oar hoises were kept, or rather staryed, undergroundi 
%nd ai for our aenrants, whom we hired here to look afte 
ourselves and horses, we had, every now and then, theii 
fingers and toes to thaw and take care of^ lest they should 
mortify and fall off. 

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses being 
dose, the walls thick, Uie lights small, and the glass all 
double. Our food was chiefly the flesh of deer, dried and 
cured in the season ; bread good: enough, but baked as bis* 
cuits ; dried fish of several sorts, and some flesh of mutton 
and of the buffaloes, which is pretty good meat. All the 
stores of provisions for the winter are laid up in the summer, 
and well cured : our drink was water, mixed with aqua-vitje 
instead of brandy ; and for a treat, mead instead of wine, 
which, however, they have excellent good. The hunters, 
who venture abroad all weathers, frequently brought us in 
fine venison, and sometimes bcar*s flesh, but we did not 
much care for the last. We had a good stock of tea, with 
which we treated our friends, as above, and we lived very 
cheerfully and well, all things considered. 

It was now March, the days grown considerably longer, 
and the weather at least tolerable ; so the other travellers 
began to prepare sledges to carry them over the snow, and to 
get things ready to be going : but my measures being fixed, 
as I have said, for Archangel, and not for Muscovy or the 
Baltic, I made no motion ; knowing very well that the ships 
from the south do not set out for that part of the world till 
May 01 June, and that if I was there by the beginning of 
August, it would be as soon as any ships would be ready to 
go away ; and therefore I made no haste to be gone, as 
others did : in a word, I saw a great many people, nay, all 
the travellers, go away before me. It seems, every year 
they go from thence to Muscovy for trade, viz., to carry fursi 
and buy necessaries, which they bring back with them ta 
fbr!iish their shops : also others went on the same errand fef 



ROBINSON CRUSOR ti$ 

Aftliafigel; but then they all being to come back agaii\ 
kbove eight hundred miles, went all out before me. 

In the month of May I began to make all ready to pack 
up ; and, as I was doing this, it occurred to me that, seeing 
all these people were banished by the Czar of Muscovy to 
Siberia, and yet, when they came there, were left at liberty 
to go whither they would, why they did not then go aw&y 
to any part of the world, wherever they thought fit ; and 1 
began to examine what should hinder them from making 
such an attempt. But my wonder was over when 1 entered 
upon that subject with the person I have mentioned, who 
answered me thus : Consider, first, sir, said he, the plac^ 
where we are ; and, secondly, the condition we are in ; 
especially the generality of the people who are banished 
hither. We are surrounded with stronger things than barn 
or bolts : on the north side an unnuvigable ocean, where 
ship never sailed, and boat never swam ; every other way, 
we have above a thousand miles to pass through the czar's 
own dominions, and by ways utterly impassable, except by 
the roads made by the government, and through the towns 
garrisoned by his troops ; so that we could neither pass un- 
discovered by the road, nor subsist any other way : so that it 
18 in vain to attempt it. 

I was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that they were 
in a prison every jot as secure as if they had been locked up 
in the castle at Moscow : however, it came into my thoughts 
that I might certainly be made an instrument to procure the 
escape of this excellent person ; and that, whatever hazard 1 
ran, I would certainly try if I could carry him off. Upon 
this I took an occasion, one evening, to tell him n.^ 
thoughts. I represented to him that it was very easy for me 
to carry him away, there being no guard over him in the 
eountry ; and af I was not going to Moscow, but to Arch- 
angel, and that J went in the retinue of a caravan, by whipb

Imt could encamp every night where I wo aid. we mlglit

mediately secure him on board an English ship, and carry 
him safe along with me ; and as to his subsistence, and 
other particulars, it should be my care, till he could bettei 
•upply himself. 

H6 heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on me 
all the while I spoke ; nay, I could see in his very face that 
what I said put his spirits into an exceeding ferment : his 
eolor frequently changed, his eyes looked red, and his heart 
fluttered, that it might be even perceived in his countenance ; 
nor could he immediately answer me when 1 had done, and 
as it were hesitated ^hat he would say to it: but after he 
had paused a little, he embraced me, and said. How unhappy 
ire we, unguarded creatures as we are, that even our greatest 
acts of friendship are made snares unto us, and we are made 
tempters of one another! My dear frie^, said he, your 
offer is so jincere, has such kindness in it, is so disinterested 
in its^ and is so calculated for my advantage, that I must 
have very little knowledge of the world if I did not both 
wonder at it, and acknowledge the obligation I have upon 
me to you for it. But did you believe I was sincere in what 
I have often said to you of my contempt of the world ? Did 
you believe I spoke my very soul to you, and that I had 
really obtained that degree of felicity here that had placed 
me above all that the world could give me ? Did you be- 
lieve I was sincere when 1 told you I would not go back, ii 
I was recalled even to be all that I once was in the court, 
with the favor of the czar ifiy master ? Did you believe me, 
my friend, to be an honest man ; or did yo:. believe me to 
oe a boasting hypocrite ? Here he stopped, as if he would 
^ar what I would say ; but, indeed, I soon after perceived 
that he stopped because his spirits weie in motion, his great 
heart was full of struggles, and he could not go on. 1 was, 
i ^Tifess, astonished at the thing as well as at the man, and

I u^d some arguments with him to urge him to set himsel 
free ; that he ought to look upon this as a door opened b^ 
Heaven for his deliverance, and a summons by Providence 
who has the care and disposition of all events, to do himset 
good, and to render himself useful in the world. 

He hai by this time recovered himself: How do you 
know, sir, says he, warmly, but that, instead of a suihmoni 
from Heaven, it may be a feint of another instrument ; r«v 
presenting in alluring colors to me the show of felicity as a 
deliverance, which may in itself be my snare, and tend 
directly to my ruin ? Here I am free from the temptation 
of returning to my former miserable greatness ; there I am 
not sure but that all the seeds of pride, ambition, avarice, 
and luxury, which I know remain in nature, may revive and 
take root, and, in a word, again overwhelm me ; and then 
ihe happy prisoner, whom you see now master of his soul*b 
liberty, shall be the miserable slave of his own senses, in 
the full of all personal liberty. Dear sir, let me remain in 
this blessed confinement, banished from the crimes of life, 
rather than purchase a show of freedom at the expense oJ 
the liberty of my reason, and at the future happiness which 
I now have in my view, but shall then, I fear, quickly lose 
sight* of: for I am but flesh; a man, a mere man; have 
passions and affections as likely to possess and overthrow 
me as any man : O be not my friend and tempter both 
together ! 

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and 
ftood silent, looking at him, and, indeed, admiring what I 
saw. The struggle in his soul was so great, that though the 
weather was extremely cold, it put him into a most violent 
sweat, and I found he wanted to give vent to his mind ; so 
I said a word or two, that 1 would leave him to consider ol 
X, and wait on him again, and then I withdrew to my own 
apartment. 

About ti7o hours after, I heard somebody at op ae%* tli9

rhandlse, was mightily pleased with our stay, on account of 
^he traffick we made here. 

It was the beginning of June when I left this remote 
place, a city, I believe little heard of in the world ; and, 
ndeed, it is so far out of the road of commerce, that I know 
not how it should be much talked of. We were now reduced 
to a very small caravan, having only thirty-two horses and 
camels in all, and all of them passed for mine, though my 
new guest was proprietor of eleven of them : it was most 
natural also that J should take more servants with me than 
I had before ; and the young lord passed n^r my steward ; 
what great man I passed for myself I know not, neither diu 
it concern me to inquire. We had here the worst and the 
largest desert to pass over that we met with in our whole 
journey : I call it the worst, because the way was very deep 
in dome places, and very uneven in others ; the best we had 
to say for it was, that we thought we had no troops of Tar- 
tars or robbers to fear, and that they never came on this side 
the river Oby, or at least but very seldom ; but we fotmd it 
ofiie.'wise. 

My young lord had a faithful Muscovite, or rather a Sibe 
rian servant, who was perfectly acquainted with the country, 
and led us by private roads, so that we avoided coming into 
*:he principal towns and cities upon the great road, such as 
Tumen, Soloy Kamskoi, and several ')thers ; because the 
Muscovite garrisons which are kepi ^ere are very curious 
and strict in their observation upon travellers, and searching 
lest any of the banished persons of note should make their 
escape that way into Muscovy ; but by this means, as we 
were kept out of the cities, so our whole journey was a 
desert, and we were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents, 
when we might have had very good accommodation in the. 
cities on the way : this the young lord was so sensible 
of^ that he would not allow us to lie abroad when we came 
c seve^aA cities on the way, but lay abroad himself, with hit

servant, in the woods, and met us always at the appointed 
places. 

We weie just entered Europe, having passed the river 
Kama, which in these parts is the houndarjr between Eirope 
and Asia, and the first city on the European side was called 
Soloy Kamskoi, which is as much as to say, the great city 
on the river Kama ; and here we thought to see some evident 
alteration in the people ; but we were mistaken : for as we 
had a vast desert to pass, which is near seven hundred milea 
long in some places, but not above two hundred miles 
over where we passed it, so, till we came past that horrible 
place, we found very little difference between that country 
and the Mogul Tartary : the people are mostly pagans, and 
little better than the savages of America ; their houses and 
towns full of idols, and their way of living wholly barbarous, 
except in the cities, as above, and the villages neai them 
where they are Christians, as they call themselves, of tht 
Greek church ; but have their religion mingled with so many 
relics of superstition, that it is scarce to be known in some 
places from mere sorcery and witchcraft. 

In passing this forest, I thought, indeed, we must (after 
all our dangers were to our imagination escaped, as before) 
have been plundered and robbed, and perhaps murdered, by 
a troop of thieves : of what country they were I am yet at 
a loss to know, but they were all on horseback, carried 
bows and arrows, and were at first about forty-five iu 
number: they came so near to us as to be within two musk it 
fthots, and asking no questions, surrounded us with theii 
Horses, and looked very earnestly upon us twice : at length 
khey placed themselves just in our way ; upon which we 
drew up in a little line, before our camels, being not above 
sixteen men in all ; and being drawn up thus, we halted, 
and sent out the Siberian servant, who attended his lord, ta 
see who they were : his master was the more willing to le 
him go because he was not a little apprehensive that tht

eoming up U) the dead, we judged they were Tartan, ba* 
knew not Low they came to make an excursion of such ai 
nnusual let^gth. 

We slept little, you may be sui e, but spent the most par 
of the night in strengthening our situation, and barricading 
the entrances into the wood, and keeping a strict watch. 
We waited for daylight, and when it came, it gave us a very 
unwelcome discovery, indeed ; for the enemy, who we thought 
were discouraged with the reception they met with, were 
now greatly increased, and had set up eleven or twelve huts 
or tents, as if they were resolved to besiege us : and this 
little camp they had pitched upon the open plain, about 
three quarters of a mile from us. We were, indeed, sur- 
prised at this discovery ; and now, I confess, I gave myself 
over for lost, and all that I had ; the loss of my effects did 
not lie so near me, though very considerable, as the thoughts 
of falling into the hands of such barbarians, at the latter 
end of my journey, after so many difficulties and hazards as 
I had gone through, and even in sight of our port, where 
we expected safety and deliverance. As to my partner, he 
was raging, and declared that to lose his goods would be his 
ruin, and that he would rather die than be starved ; and he 
was for fighting to the last drop. 

The young lord, as gallant as ever flesh showed itself, was 
for fighting to the last also ; and my old pilot was of the 
opinion that we were able to resist them all m the situation 
we were then in ; and thus we spent the day in debates o 
what we should do ; but towards evening we found that thf 
number of our enemies still increased, and we did not know 
but by the morning they might be a still greater number * 
so I began to enquire of those people we had brought froiv 
Tobolski, if there were no private ways, by which we migh 
avoid them in the night, and perhaps retreat to some town 
mg get help to guard us over the desert. The Siberian, wht 
' was servant to the young lord, told us, if we designed U 



ROBINSOI«i CRUSOB. e2S 

AToid them, and not fight, he would engage to cairy qs od 
in the night, to a way that went north, towards the river 
Petrou, by -vhich he made no question but we might get 
away, and the Taicars never the wiser; but, he said, his 
lord had told him he would not retreat, but would rather 
ehoose to fight. I told him he mistook his lord ; for that he 
was too wise a man to love fighting for the sake of it ; and 
that I knew his lord was Drave enough, by what he had 
showed already ; but that his lord knew better than to dcsiis 
seventeen or eighteen men to fight five hundred, unless an 
unavoidable necessity forced them to it; and that, if he 
thought it possible for us to escape in the night, we had 
nothing else to do but to attempt it. He answered, if his 
lordship gave him such orders he would lose his life if he 
did not perform it : we soon brought his lord to give that 
order, though privately, and we immediately prepared for 
the putting it in practice. 

And, first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a 
fi e in onr little camp, which we kept burning, and prepared 
so as to make it burn all night, that the Tartars might con- 
clude we were still there ; but as soon as it was dark, and 
we could see the stars (for our guide would not stir before), 
having all our horses and camels ready loaded, we followed 
onr new guide, who I soon found steered himself by the 
north star. 

After we had travelled two hours very hard, it began to 
be lighter still ; not that it was quite dark all night, but the 
moon began to rise, so that, in short, it was rather lighter 
than we wished it to be ; but by six o'clock the next morn- 
ing we were got above thirty miles, ha^ng almost spoiled 
our horses. Here we found a Russian vilage, named Ker- 
mazinskoy, where we rested, and heard nothing of the 
Kalmuck Tartars that day. About two hours before nigh* 
we set out again, and travelled till eight the next morning, 
though not quite at hard as before ; and about seven o'clock 



§30 ▲DVBNTURES OF 

we pnssed 8 little river, called Kirtza, and came .o a good 
large town inhabited by Russians, called Ozomoys: tbert 
we heard that several troops of Kalmucks had been abroad 
Qpon the desert, but that we were now completely out ol 
danger of them, which was to our great satisfaction. Here 
we were oblig^ to get some fresh horses ; and having need 
enough of rest, we stayed five days ; and my partner and 1 
agreed to give the honest Siberian who brought us thither 
the value of ten pistoles. 

In five days more we came to Veuslima, upon the river 
Wirtzogda, and running into the D>ma: we were there, 
very happily, near the end of our travels by land, that river 
b^ing navigable, in seven days' passage, to ArchangeL 
From hence we came to Lawrenskoy the 3d of July ; and 
providing ourselves with two luggage boats, and a barge for 
our own convenience, we embarked the 7th, and arrived all 
jafe at Archangel the 18th ; having been a year, five months, 
and three days on the journey, including our stay of ^ight 
months at Tolx^skL We were obliged to stay at thia place 
six weeks for the arrival of the ships, and must have tarried 
longer, had not a Hamburgher come in above a month sooner 
than any of the English ships : when, after some considera- 
tion that the city of Hamburgh might happen to be as good 
a market for our goods as London, we all took freight with 
Aim ; and, having put our goods on board, it was most nat- 
ural for me to put my steward on board to take caie o' 
them : by whidi means my young lord had a suFcien 
opportunity to conceal himself, never coming on shore i^gain 
all the time we stayed there ; and this he did that he might 
not be seen in the city, where some of the Moscow mer- 
ehants would certainly have seen and discovered him. 

We then set sail from Archangel the 20th of August, the 
same year ; and after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived 
safe in the Elbe the 18th of September. Here my partner 
and I found a «ery good sale for our goods, as well those o

Ok ma as the sables, dc^c, of Siberia; and dividing the piu* 
dtce, my share amounted to three thousand four hundred 
and seventy-five pounds seventeen shillings and threepence, 
including about six hundred pounds* worth of diamondi 
which I purchased at Bengal. 

Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went up 
the Elbp, in order to go to the court of Vienna, where ho 
resolved to seek protection, and could correspond with 
those of his father's friends who were left alive. He did 
not part without testimonies of gratitude for the service I 
had done him, and sense of my kindness to the prince his 
fiither. 

To conclude, having staid near four months in Hamburgh, 
1 came from thence by land to the Hague, where I em- 
barked in the packet, and arrived in London the 10th ol 
i^anuary, 1705, having been absent from England ten years 
and nine months. And here 1 resolved to prepare for a 
longer journey than all these, having lived a life of infinite 
variety seventy-two years, and learned sufficiently to knoif 
the value of retirement, and the blessing of ending oui dftjf 
n peace.
