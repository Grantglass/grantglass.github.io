vol. n. — 1 



THE LIFE OF 

COLONEL JACQUE 

IT was three years after this before I could get 
things in order, fit for my leaving the country. 
In this time I delivered my tutor from his 
bondage, and would have given him his liberty, 
but, to my great disappointment, I found that I 
could not empower him to go for England till his 
time was expired, according to the certificate of his 
transportation, which was registered; so I made 
him one of my overseers, and thereby raised him 
gradually to a prospect of living in the same manner 
and by the like steps that my good benefactor raised 
me, only that I did not assist him to enter upon 
planting for himself as I was assisted, neither was I 
upon the spot to do it. But this man's diligence 
and honest application, even unassisted, delivered 
himself, [though not] any farther than, as I say, by 
making him an overseer, which was only a present 
ease and deliverance to him from the hard labour 
and fare which he endured as a servant. 

However, in this trust he behaved so faithfully and 
so diligently that it recommended him in the coun-

THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

try ; and when I came back I found him in circum- 
stances very different from what I left him in, 
besides his being my principal manager for near 
twenty years, as you shall hear in its place. 

I mention these things the more at large that, 
if any unhappy wretch who may have the disaster 
to fall into such circumstances as these may come to 
see this account, they may learn the following short 
lessons from these examples : — 

I. That Virginia and a state of transportation 
may be the happiest place and condition they were 
ever in for this life, as, by a sincere repentance and 
a diligent application to the business they are put 
to, they are effectually delivered from a life of flagrant 
wickedness and put in a perfect new condition, in 
which they have no temptation to the crimes tbey 
formerly committed, and have a prospect of advan- 
tage for the future. 

II. That in Virginia the meanest and most despi- 
cable creature, after his time of servitude is expired, 
if he will but apply himself with diligence and in- 
dustry to the business of the country, is sure (life 
and health supposed) both of living well and growing 
rich. 

As this is a foundation which the most unfortu- 
nate wretch alive is entitled to, a transported felon 
is, in my opinion, a much happier man than the 
most prosperous untaken thief in the nation. Nor 

[4] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

are those poor young people so much in the wrong 
as some imagine them to be that go voluntarily over 
to those countries, and in order to get themselves 
carried over and placed there, freely bind themselves 
there, especially if the persons into whose hands 
they fall do anything honestly by them ; for, as it is 
to be supposed that those poor people knew not what 
course to take before, or had miscarried in their 
conduct before, here they are sure to be immediately 
provided for, and, after the expiration of their time, 
to be put in a condition to provide for themselves. 
But I return to my own story, which now begins a 
new scene. 

I was now making provision for my going to 
England. After having settled my plantation in such 
hands as was fully to my satisfaction, my first work 
was to furnish myself with such a stock of goods and 
money as might be sufficient for my occasions abroad, 
and particularly might allow me to make large re- 
turns to Maryland, for the use and supply of all my 
plantations. But when I came to look nearer into 
the voyage, it occurred to me that it would not be 
prudent to put my cargo all on board the same ship 
that I went in ; so I shipped at several times five 
hundred hogsheads of tobacco in several ships for 
England, giving notice to my correspondent in 
London that I would embark about such a time to 
come over myself, and ordering him to insure for a 
[5] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

considerable sum, proportioned to the value of my 
cargo. 

About two months after this I left the place, and 
embarked for England in a stout ship, carrying 
twenty-four guns and about six hundred hogsheads 
of tobacco, and we left the capes of Virginia on the 
1st of August. We had a very sour and rough 
voyage for the first fortnight, though it was in a 
season so generally noted for good weather. 

After we had been about eleven days at sea, hav- 
ing the wind most part of the time blowing very 
hard at west, or between the west and northwest, by 
which we were carried a great way farther to the east- 
ward than they usually go in their course for Eng- 
land, we met with a furious tempest, which held us 
five days, blowing most of the time excessive hard, 
and by which we were obliged to run away afore the 
wind, as the seamen call it, wheresoever it was our 
lot to go. By this storm our ship was greatly dam- 
aged, and some leaks we had, but not so bad that 
by the diligence of the seamen they were stopped. 
However, the captain, after having beaten up again 
as well as he could against the weather, and the sea 
going very high, at length he resolved to go away for 
the Bermudas. 

I was not seaman enough to understand what the 
reason of their disputes was, but in their running for 
the islands it seems they overshot the latitude, and 
[6] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQU^ 

could never reach the islands of Bermudas again. 
The master and the mate differed to an extremity 
about this, their reckonings being more than usually 
wide of one another, the storm having driven them 
a little out of their knowledge. The master, being 
a positive man, insulted the mate about it, and 
threatened to expose him for it when he came to 
England. The mate was an excellent sea artist and 
an experienced sailor, but withal a modest man, and 
though he insisted upon his being right, did it in 
respectful terms and as it became him. But after 
several days' dispute, when the weather came to 
abate and the heavens to clear up, that they could 
take their observations and know where they were, 
it appeared that the mate's account was right, and 
the captain was mistaken ; for they were then in the 
latitude of 29 degrees, and quite out of the wake of 
the Bermudas. 

The mate made no indecent use of the discovery 
at all, and the captain, being convinced, carried it 
civilly to him, and so the heats were over among 
them ; but the next question was, what they should 
do next. Some were for going one way, some 
another ; but all agreed that they were not in a con- 
dition to go on the direct course for England, unless 
they could have a southerly or south-west wind, 
which had not been our fate since we came to sea. 

Upon the whole, they resolved by consent to steer 

[7] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

away to the Canaries, which was the nearest land they 
could make except the Cape de Verde Islands, which 
were too much to the southward for us, if it could 
be avoided. 

Upon this they stood away N.E., and the wind 
hanging still westerly, or to the northward of the 
west, we made good way, and in about fifteen days' 
sail we made the Pico TenerifFe, being a monstrous 
hill in one of the Canary Islands. Here we refreshed 
ourselves, got fresh water and some fresh provisions, 
and plenty of excellent wine, but no harbour to run 
into, to take care of the ship, which was leaky and 
tender, having had so much very bad weather ; so we 
were obliged to do as well as we could, and put to sea 
again, after riding at the Canaries four days only. 

From the Canaries we had tolerable weather and 
a smooth sea till we came into the soundings — so 
they call the mouth of the British Channel — and 
the wind blowing hard at the N. and the N.W. 
obliged us to keep a larger offing, as the seamen call 
it, at our entrance into the Channel ; when, behold ! 
in the grey of the morning a French cruiser or 
privateer of twenty-six guns appeared, and crowded 
after us with all the sail they could make. In short, 
our captain exchanged a broadside or two with them, 
which was terrible work to me, for I had never seen 
such before, the Frenchman's guns having raked us, 
and killed and wounded six of our best men. 

[*} 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

In short, after a fight long enough to show us 
that if we would not be taken we must resolve to 
sink by her side, for there was no room to expect 
deliverance, and a fight long enough to save the 
master's credit, we were taken, and the ship carried 
away to St Malo. 

I was not much concerned for the loss I had in 
the ship, because I knew I had sufficient in the 
world somewhere or other ; but as I was effectually 
stripped of everything I had about me, and even 
almost my clothes from my back, I was in but a very 
indifferent condition. But somebody informing the 
captain of the privateer, that I was a passenger and 
a merchant, he called for me and inquired into my 
circumstances, and coming to hear from myself how 
I had been used, obliged the seamen to give me a 
coat and hat and a pair of shoes, which they had 
taken off me, and himself gave me a morning gown 
of his own to wear while I was in his ship, and, to 
give him his due, treated me very well. 

I had, however, besides my being taken, the mor- 
tification to be detained on board the cruiser, and 
seeing the ship I was in manned with Frenchmen and 
sent away, as above, for St. Malo ; and this was a 
greater mortification to me afterwards, when, being 
brought into St Malo, I heard that our own ship was 
retaken in her passage to St Malo by an English 
man-of-war and carried to Portsmouth. 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

When our ship was sent away the Rover cruised 
abroad again in the mouth of the Channel for some 
time, but met with no purchase. At last they made 
a sail, which proved to be one of their nation and 
one of their own trade, from whom they learned, the 
news having been carried to England that some 
French privateers lay off and on in the soundings, 
that three English men-of-war were come out from 
Plymouth on purpose to cruise in the Channel, and 
that they would certainly meet with us. Upon this 
intelligence the Frenchman, a bold, brave fellow, far 
from shrinking from his work, stands away N.E. 
for St. George's Channel, and in the latitude of 48 
degrees and a half, unhappily enough, meets with 
a large and rich English ship, bound home from 
Jamaica. It was in the grey of the morning, and 
very clear, when a man on the roundtop cried out, 
" Au voile, a sail." I was in hopes indeed it had 
been the English men-of-war, and by the hurry and 
clutter they were in to get all ready for a fight, I 
concluded it was so, and got out of my hammock 
(for I had no cabin to lie in) that I might see what 
it was ; but I soon found that my hopes were in 
vain, and it was on the wrong side ; for that that 
being on our larboard bow, the ship lying then 
northward to make the coast of Ireland, by the time 
I was turned out I could perceive they had all their 
sails bent and full, having begun to chase, and mak- 
[10] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

ing great way. On the other hand, it was evident 
the ship saw them too, and knew what they were, 
and, to avoid them, stretched away with all the 
canvas they could lay on for the coast of Ireland, 
to run in there for harbour. 

Our privateer, it was plain, infinitely outsailed her, 
running two foot for her one, and towards evening 
came up with them. Had they been able to have 
held it but six hours longer they would have got 
into Limerick River, or somewhere under shore, so 
that we should not have ventured upon them. But 
we came up with them, and the captain, when he saw 
there was no remedy, bravely brought to and pre- 
pared to fight. She was a ship of thirty guns, but 
deep in the sea, cumbered between decks with goods, 
and could not run out her lower-deck guns, the sea 
also going pretty high, though at last she ventured 
to open her gun-room ports and fire with three guns 
on a side. But her worst fate was, she sailed heavy, 
being deep loaden, and the Frenchman had run up 
by her side and poured in his broadside, and was 
soon ready again. However, as she was well manned 
too, and that the English sailors bestirred themselves, 
they gave us their broadsides too very nimbly and 
heartily, and I found the Frenchman had a great 
many men killed at the first brush. But the next 
was worse, for the English ship, though she did not 
sail so well as the Frenchman, was a bigger ship and 

[ii] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

strong built, and as we (the French) bore down upon 
them again, the English run boldly on board us, and 
laid thwart our hawse, lashing themselves fast to us. 
Then it was that the English captain run out his 
lower tier of guns, and indeed tore the Frenchman so, 
that, had he held it, the privateer would have had ' 
the worst of it. But the Frenchman, with admirable 
readiness, indeed, and courage, the captain appearing 
everywhere with his sword in his hand, bestirred 
themselves, and loosing themselves from the English 
ship, thrusting her off with brooms, and pouring 
their small shot so thick that the other could not 
appear upon deck ; I say, clearing themselves thus, 
they came to lie a-broadside of each other, when, by 
long firing, the English ship was at length disabled, 
her mizzen-mast and bowsprit shot away, and, 
which was worst of all, her captain killed ; so that, 
after a fight which held all night — for they fought 
in the dark — and part of the next day, they were 
obliged to strike. 

I was civilly desired by the French captain to go 
down into the hold while the fight held, and, besides 
the civility of it, I found he was not willing I should 
be upon deck. Perhaps he thought I might have 
some opportunity to do hurt, though I know not 
how it could be. However, I was very ready to go 
down, for I had no mind to be killed, especially by 
my own friends; so I went down and sat by the 
[12] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

surgeon, and had the opportunity to find that, the 
first broadside the English fired, seven wounded men 
were brought down to the surgeon, and three-and- 
thirty more afterwards, that is to say, when the 
English lay thwart their bow ; and after they cleared 
themselves there were about eleven more; so that 
they had one-and-fifty men wounded and about two- 
and-twenty killed. The Englishman had eighteen 
men killed and wounded, among whom was the 
captain. 9 

The French captain, however, triumphed in his 
prize; for it was an exceeding rich ship, having 
abundance of silver on board. And after the ship 
was taken and they had plundered all the great 
cabin afforded, which was very considerable, the 
mate promised the captain that, if he would give 
him his liberty, he would discover six thousand pieces 
of eight to him privately/ which none of the men 
should know of. The captain engaged, and gave it 
under his hand to set him at liberty as soon as he 
came on shore. Accordingly, in the night, after all 
was either turned in, as they call it, or employed 
on the duty of the watch, the captain and the mate 
of the prize went on board, and having faithfully 
discovered the money, which lay in a place made on 
purpose to conceal it, the captain resolved to let it 
lie till they arrived, and then he conveyed it on 
shore for his own use ; so that the owners, nor the 
[13 J 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

seamen, ever came to any share of it, which, by the 
way, was a fraud in the captain. But the mate paid 
his ransom by the discovery, and the captain gave 
him his liberty very punctually, as he had promised, 
and two hundred pieces of eight to carry him to 
England and to make good his losses. 

When he had made this prize, the captain thought 
of nothing more than how to get safe to France with 
her, for she was a ship sufficient to enrich all his 
men and his owners also. The account of her cargo, 
by the captain's books, of which I took a copy, was 
in general : 

260 hogsheads of sugar. 
187 smaller casks of sugar. 
176 barrels of indigo. 
28 casks of pimento. 
42 bags of cotton wool. 
80 cwt. of elephants' teeth. 
60 small casks of rum. 
18,000 pieces of eight, besides the six thou- 
sand concealed. 
Several parcels of drugs, tortoise-shell, sweetmeats, 
called succades, chocolate, lime juice, and other 
things of considerable value. 

This was a terrible loss among the English mer- 
chants, and a noble booty for the rogues that took 
it ; but as it was in open war and by fair fighting, 
as they call it, there was no objection to be made 
[14] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

against them, and, to give them their due, they 
fought bravely for it. 

The captain was not so bold as to meeting the 
English men-of-war before, but he was as wary now ; 
for, having a prize of such value in his hands, he 
was resolved not to lose her again, if he could help 
it. So he stood away to the southward, and that 
so far that I once thought he was resolved to go 
into the Straits, and home by Marseilles. But hav- 
ing sailed to the latitude of 45 degrees 3 quarters, 
or thereabouts, he steered away east, into the bottom 
of the Bay of Biscay, and carried us all into the 
river of Bordeaux, where, on notice of his arrival 
with such a prize, his owners or principals came 
overland to see him, and where they consulted what 
to do with her. The money they secured, to be 
sure, and some of the cargo ; but the ships sailed 
afterwards along the coast to St. Malo, taking the 
opportunity of some French men-of-war which were 
cruising on the coast to be their convoy as far as 
Ushant 

Here the captain rewarded and dismissed the 
English mate, as I have said, who got a passage 
from thence to Dieppe by sea, and after that into 
England, by the help of a passport, through Flanders 
to Ostend. The captain, it seems, the more willingly 
shipped him off that he might not discover to others 
what he had discovered to him. 
[15] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

I was now at Bordeaux, in France, and the captain 
asked me one morning what I intended to do. I did 
not understand him at first, but he soon gave me to 
understand that I was now either to be delivered up 
to the state as an English prisoner, and so be carried 
to Dinan, in Brittany, or to find means to have my- 
self exchanged, or to pay my ransom, and this ran- 
som he told me at first was three hundred crowns. 

I knew not what to do, but desired he would give 
me time to write to England to my friends ; for 
that I had a cargo, of goods sent to them by me 
from Virginia, but I did not know but it might have 
fallen into such hands as his were, and if it was, I 
knew not what would be my fate. He readily 
granted that ; so I wrote by the post, and had the 
satisfaction, in answer to it, to hear that the ship I 
was taken in had been retaken, and carried into 
Portsmouth ; which I doubted would have made my 
new master more strict, and perhaps insolent; but 
he said nothing of it to me, nor I to him, though, 
as I afterwards understood, he had advice of it 
before. 

However, this was a help to me, and served to 
more than pay my ransom to the captain. And my 
correspondent in London, hearing of my being alive 
and at Bordeaux, immediately sent me a letter of 
credit upon an English merchant at Bordeaux for 
whatever I might have occasion for. As soon as I 
[16] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

received this I went to the merchant, who honoured 
the letter of credit, and told me I should have what 
money I pleased. But as I, who was before a mere 
stranger in the place and knew not what course to 
take, had now, as it were, a friend to communicate 
my affairs to and consult with, as soon as I told him 
my case, u Hold," says he ; " if that be your case, I 
may perhaps find a way to get you off without a 
ransom." 

There was, it seems, a ship bound home to France 
from Martinico, taken off Cape Finisterre by an 
English man-of-war, and a merchant of Rochelle, 
being a passenger, was taken on board, and brought 
into Plymouth. This man had made great solicita- 
tion by his friends to be exchanged, pleading pov- 
erty, and that he was unable to pay any ransom. 
My friend told me something of it, but not much, 
only bade me not be too forward to pay any money 
to the captain, but pretend I could not hear from 
England. This I did till the captain appeared 
impatient. 

After some time the captain told me I had used 
him ill ; that I had made him expect a ransom, and 
he had treated me courteously and been at expense 
to subsist me, and that I held him in suspense, but 
that, in short, if I did not procure the money, he 
would send me to Dinan in ten days, to lie there as 
the king's prisoner till I should be exchanged. My 
tol. u.— 9 [17] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

merchant gave me my cue, and by his direction I an- 
swered I was very sensible of his civility, and sorry 
he should lose what expenses he had been at, but 
that I found my friends forgot me, and what to do 
I did not know, and that, rather than impose upon 
him, I must submit to go to Dinan, or where he 
thought fit to send me ; but that if ever I obtained 
my liberty, and came into England, I would not fail 
to reimburse him what expense he had been at for 
my subsistence ; and so, in short, made my case very 
bad in all my discourse. He shook his head and 
said little, but the next day entered me in the list of 
English prisoners to be at the king's charge, as ap- 
pointed by the intendant of the place, and to be 
sent* away into Brittany. 

I was then out of the captain's power, and imme- 
diately the merchant, with two others who were 
friends to the merchant prisoner at Plymouth, went 
to the intendant and gained an order for the ex- 
change, and my friend giving security for my being 
forthcoming, in case the other was not delivered, I 
had my liberty immediately, and went home with 
him to his house. 

Thus we bilked the captain of his ransom money. 
But, however, my friend went to him, and letting 
him know that I was exchanged by the governor's 
order, paid him whatever he could say he was in dis- 
burse on my account ; and it was not then in the 
[18] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

captain's power to object, or to claim anything for 
a ransom. 

I got passage from hence to Dunkirk on board a 
French vessel, and having a certificate of an ex- 
changed prisoner from the intendent at Bordeaux, I 
had a passport given me to go into the Spanish 
Netherlands, and so whither I pleased. 

Accordingly I came to Ghent, in April , just 

as the armies were going to take the field. I had 
no dislike to the business of the army, but I thought 
I was a little above it now, and had other things to 
look to ; for that, in my opinion, nobody went into 
the field but those that could not live at home. And 
yet I resolved to see the manner of it a little too, so, 
having made an acquaintance with an English officer 
quartered at Ghent, I told him my intention, and 
he invited me to go with him, and offered me his 
protection as a volunteer, that I should quarter with 
him in his tent, and live as I would, and either carry 
arms or not, as I saw occasion. 

The campaign was none of the hardest that had 
been, or was like to be ; so that I had the diversion 
of seeing the service, as it was proper to call it, with- 
out much hazard. Indeed I did not see any con- 
siderable action, for there was not much fighting 
that campaign. As to the merit of the cause on 
either side, I knew nothing of it, nor had I suffered 
any of the disputes about it to enter into my thoughts. 
[19] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

The Prince of Orange had been made king of Eng- 
land, and the English troops were all on his side ; 
and I heard a great deal of swearing and damning 
for King William among the soldiers. But as for 
fighting, I observed the French beat them several 
times, and particularly the regiment my friend be- 
longed to was surrounded in a village where they 
were posted, I knew not upon what occasion, and 
all taken prisoners. But by great good hap, I, 
being not in service, and so not in command, was 
strolled away that day to see the country about ; for 
it was my delight to see the strong towns, and ob- 
serve the beauty of their fortifications ; and while I 
diverted myself thus, I had the happy deliverance 
of not being taken by the French for that time. 

When I came back I found the enemy possessed 
of the town, but as I was no soldier they did me no 
harm, and having my French passport in my pocket, 
they gave me leave to go to Nieuport, where I took 
the packet-boat and came over to England, land- 
ing at Deal instead of Dover, the weather forcing 
us into the Downs; and thus my short campaign 
ended, and this was my second essay at the trade of 
soldiering. 

When I came to London I was very well received 

by my friend, to whom I had consigned my effects, 

and I found myself in very good circumstances ; for 

all my goods, which, as above, by several ships, I 

[20] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

had consigned to him, came safe to hand ; and my 
overseers that I had left behind had shipped at 
several times four hundred hogsheads of tobacco 
to my correspondent in my absence, being the product 
of my plantation, or part of it, for the time of my 
being abroad ; so that I had above i?1000 in my 
factor's hands, two hundred hogsheads of tobacco 
besides left in hand, not sold 

I had nothing to do now but entirely to conceal 
myself from all that had any knowledge of me before. 
And this was the easiest thing in the world to do ; 
for I was grown out of everybody's knowledge, and 
most of those I had known were grown out^of mine. 
My captain, who went with me, or, rather, who car- 
ried me away, I found, by inquiring at the proper 
place, had been rambling about the world, came to 
London, fell into his own trade, which he could not 
forbear, and growing an eminent highwayman, had 
made his exit at the gallows, after a life of fourteen 
years' most exquisite and successful rogueries, the 
particulars of which would make, as I observed, an 
admirable history. My other brother Jacque, who 
I called major, followed the like wicked trade, but 
was a man of more gallantry and generosity ; and 
having committed innumerable depredations upon 
mankind, yet had always so much dexterity as to 
bring himself off, till at length he was laid fast in 
Newgate, and loaded with irons, and would certainly 
[21] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

have gone the same way as the captain, but he was 
so dexterous a rogue that no gaol, no fetters, would 
hold him ; and he, with two more, found means to 
knock off their irons, worked their way through the 
wall of the prison, and let themselves down on the 
outside in the night. So escaping, they found 
means to get into France, where he followed the 
same trade, and with so much success that he grew, 
famous by the name of Anthony, and had the hon- 
our, with three of his comrades, whom he had taught 
the English way of robbing generously, as they called 
it, without murdering or wounding, or ill-using those 
they robbed ; — I say, he had the honour to be broke 
upon the wheel at the Greve in Paris. 

All these things I found means to be fully informed 
of, and to have a long account of the particulars of 
their conduct from some of their comrades who had 
the good fortune to escape, and who I got the 
knowledge of without letting them so much as guess 
at who I was or upon what account I inquired. 

I was now at the height of my good fortune. In- 
deed I was in very good circumstances, and being of 
a frugal temper from the beginning, I saved things 
together as they came, and yet lived very well too. 
Particularly I had the reputation of a very consider- 
able merchant, and one that came over vastly rich 
from Virginia ; and as I frequently bought supplies 
for my several families and plantations there as they 
[22] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

wrote to me for them, so I passed, I say, for a great 
merchant. 

I lived single, indeed, and in lodgings, but I began 
to be very well known, and though I had subscribed 
my name only " Jack * to my particular correspon- 
dent, yet the French, among whom I lived near a 
year, as I have said, not understanding what Jack 
.meant, called me Monsieur Jacques and Colonel 
Jacques, and so gradually Colonel Jacque. So I was 
called in the certificate of exchanging me with the 
other prisoner, so that I went so also into Flanders ; 
upon which, and seeing my certificate of exchange, 
as above, I was called Colonel Jacques in England 
by my friend who I called correspondent. And thus 
I passed for a foreigner and a Frenchman, and I was 
infinitely fond of having everybody take me for a 
Frenchman ; and as I spoke French very well, hav- 
ing learned it by continuing so long among them, 
so I went constantly to the French church in London, 
and spoke French upon all occasions as much as I 
could ; and, to complete the appearance of it, I got me 
a French servant to do my business — I mean as to 
my merchandise, which only consisted in receiving and 
disposing of tobacco, of which I had about five 
hundred to six hundred hogsheads a year from my 
own plantations, and in supplying my people with 
necessaries as they wanted them. 

In this private condition I continued about two 
[23] 



, THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

years more, when the devil, owing me a spleen ever 
since I refused being a thief, paid me home, with my 
interest, by laying a snare in my way which had 
almost ruined me. 

There dwelt a lady in the house opposite to the 
house I lodged in, who made an extraordinary figure 
indeed. She went very well dressed, and was a most 
beautiful person. She was well-bred, sung admirably 
fine, and sometimes I could hear her very distinctly, 
the houses being over against one another, in a 
narrow court, not much unlike Three King Court in 
Lombard Street. 

This lady put herself so often in my way that I 
could not in good manners forbear taking notice of 
her, and giving her the ceremony of my hat when I 
saw her at her window, or at the door, or when I 
passed her in the court ; so that we became almost 
acquainted at a distance. Sometimes she also visited 
at the house I lodged at, and it was generally con- 
trived that I should be introduced when she came, 
and thus by degrees we became more intimately 
acquainted, and often conversed together in the 
family, but always in public, at least for a great 
while. 

I was a mere boy in the affair of love, and knew 

the least of what belonged to a woman of any man 

in Europe of my age. The thoughts of a wife, 

much less of a mistress, had never so much as taken 

[24] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

the least hold of my head, and I had been till now 
as perfectly unacquainted with the sex, and as un- 
concerned about them, as I was when I was ten years 
old, and lay in a heap of ashes at the glass-house. 

But I know not by what witchcraft in the conver- 
sation of this woman, and her singling me out upon 
several occasions, I began to be ensnared, I knew not 
how, or to what end ; and was on a sudden so em- 
barrassed in my thoughts about her that, like a 
charm, she had me always in her circle. If she had 
not been one of the subtlest women on earth, she 
could never have brought me to have given myself 
the least trouble about her, but I was drawn in by 
the magic of a genius capable to deceive a more 
wary capacity than mine, and it was impossible to 
resist her. 

She attacked me without ceasing, with the fineness 
of her conduct, and with arts which were impossible 
to be ineffectual. She was ever, as it were, in my 
view, often in my company, and yet kept herself so 
on the reserve, so surrounded continually with ob- 
structions, that for several months after she could 
perceive I sought an opportunity to speak to her, she 
rendered it impossible; nor could I ever break in 
upon her, she kept her guard so well. 

This rigid behaviour was the greatest mystery that 
could be, considering, at the same time, that she 
never declined my seeing her or conversing with me 
[25] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

in public But she held it on ; she took care never 
to sit next me, that I might slip no paper into her 
hand or speak softly to her ; she kept somebody or 
other always between, that I could never come up 
to her; and thus, as if she was resolved really to 
have nothing to do with me, she held me at the bay 
several months. 

All this while nothing was more certain than that 
she intended to have me, if she could catch ; and it 
was indeed a kind of a catch, for she managed all 
by art, and drew me in with the most resolute back- 
wardness, that it was almost impossible not to be de- 
ceived by it. On the other hand, she did not appear 
to be a woman despicable, neither was she poor, or 
in a condition that should require so much art to 
draw any man in ; but the cheat was really on my 
side ; for she was unhappily told that I was vastly rich, 
a great merchant, and that she would live like a 
queen ; which I was not at all instrumental in put- 
ting upon her, neither did I know that she went upon 
that motive. 

She was too cunning to let me perceive how easy 
she was to be had ; on the contrary, she run all the 
hazards of bringing me to neglect her entirely that 
one would think any woman in the world could do. 
And I have wondered often since how that it was 
possible it should fail of making me perfectly averse 
to her ; for as I had a perfect indifferency for the 

- [86] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

whole sex, and never till then entertained any notion 
of them, they were no more to me than a picture 
hanging up against a wall. 

As we conversed freely together in public, so she 
took a great many occasions to rally the men, and 
the weakness they were guilty of in letting the 
women insult them as they did. She thought if the 
men had not been fools, marriage had been only 
treaties of peace between two neighbours, or alliances 
offensive or defensive, which must necessarily have 
been carried on sometimes by interviews and personal 
treaties, but oftener by ambassadors, agents, and 
emissaries on both sides ; but that the women had 
outwitted us, and brought us upon our knees, and 
made us whine after them, and lower ourselves, so as 
we could never pretend to gain our equality again. 

I told her I thought it was a decency to the ladies 
to give them the advantage of denying a little, that 
they might be courted, and that I should not like a 
woman the worse for denying me. "I expect it, 
madam," says I, ** when I wait on you to-morrow ; * 
intimating that I intended it. " You shan't be de- 
ceived, sir," says she, " for 1 11 deny now, before you 
ask me the question." 

I was dashed so effectually with so malicious, so 

devilish an answer that I returned with a little sullen- 

ness, " I shan't trespass upon you yet, madam ; and 

I shall be very careful not to offend you when I do." 

[27] 



THE LIFE OP COLONEL JACQUE 

" It is the greatest token of your respect, sir," 
says she, "that you are able to bestow upon me, 
and the most agreeable too, except one, which I 
will not be out of hopes of obtaining of you in a 
little time." 

" What is in my power to oblige you in, madam," 
said I, u you may command me in at any time, espe- 
cially the way we are talking of." This I spoke still 
with a resentment very sincere. 

" It is only, sir, that you would promise to hate 
me with as much sincerity as I will endeavour to 
make you a suitable return." 

"I granted that request, madam, seven years 
before you asked it," said I, " for I heartily hated the 
whole sex, and scarce know how I came to abate that 
good disposition in compliment to your conversation ; 
but I assure you that abatement is so little that it 
does no injury to your proposal." 

"There's some mystery in that indeed, sir," said 
she, " for I desire to assist your aversion to women 
in a more particular manner, and hoped it should 
never abate under my management." We said a 
thousand ill-natured things after this, but she out- 
did me, for she had such a stock of bitterness upon 
her tongue as no woman ever went beyond her, and 
yet all this while she was the pleasantest and most 
obliging creature in every part of our conversation 
that could possibly be, and meant not one word of 
[28] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

what she said ; no, not a word. But I must confess 
it no way answered her end, for it really cooled all 
my thoughts of her, and I, that had lived in so per- 
fect an indifferency to the sex all my days, was easily 
returned to that condition again, and began to grow 
very cold and negligent in my usual respects to her 
upon all occasions. 

She soon found she had gone too far with me, and, 
in short, that she was extremely out in her politics ; 
that she had to do with one that was not listed yet 
among the whining sort of lovers, and knew not 
what it was to adore a mistress in order to abuse 
her ; and that it was not with me as it was with the 
usual sort of men in love, that are warmed by the 
cold, and rise in their passions as the ladies fall in 
their returns. On the contrary, she found that it 
was quite altered. I was civil to her, as before, but 
not so forward. When I saw her at her chamber- 
window, I did not throw mine open, as I usually had 
done, to talk with her. When she sung in the par- 
lour, where I could easily hear it, I did not listen. 
When she visited at the house where I lodged, I did 
not always come down ; or if I did, I had business 
which obliged me to go abroad; and yet all this 
while, when I did come into her company, I was as 
intimate as ever. 

I could easily see that this madded her to the 
heart, and that she was perplexed to the last degree > 
[29] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

for she found that she had all her game to play over 
again ; that so absolute a reservedness, even to rude- 
ness and ill manners, was a little too much ; but she 
was a mere posture-mistress in love, and could put 
herself into what shapes she pleased. 

She was too wise to show a fondness or forward- 
ness that looked like kindness. She knew that was 
the meanest and last step a woman can take, and 
lays her under the foot of the man she pretends to. 
Fondness is not the last favour indeed, but it is the 
last favour but one that a woman can grant, and 
lays her almost as low ; I mean, it lays her at the 
mercy of the man she shows it to ; but she was 
not come to that neither. This chameleon put on 
another colour, turned, on a sudden, the gravest, 
soberest, majestic madam, so that any one would 
have thought sh$ was advanced in age in one week 
from two-and-twenty to fifty, and this she carried on 
with so much government of herself that it did not 
in the least look like art ; but if it was a representa- 
tion of nature only, it was so like nature itself that 
nobody living can be able to distinguish. She sung 
very often in her parlour, as* well by herself as with 
two young ladies who came often to see her. I could 
see by their books, and her guitar in her hand, that 
she was singing ; but she never opened the window, 
as she was wont to do. Upon my coming to my 
window, she kept her own always shut ; or if it was 
[80] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

open, she would be sitting at work, and not look up, 
it may be, once in half-an-hour. 

If she saw me by accident all this while, she would 
smile, and speak as cheerfully as ever; but it was 
but a word or two, and so make her honours and be 
gone; so that, in a word, we conversed just as we 
did after I had been there a week. 

She tired me quite out at this work ; for though 
I began the strangeness, indeed, yet I did not design 
the carrying it on so far. But she held it to the 
last, just in the same manner as she began it. She 
came to the house where I lodged as usual, and we 
were often together, supped together, played at cards 
together, danced together ; for in France I accom- 
plished myself with everything that was needful to 
make me what I believed myself to be even from a 
boy — I mean a gentleman. I say, we conversed to- 
gether, as above, but she was so perfectly another 
thing to what she used to be in every part of her 
conversation that it presently occurred to me that 
her former behaviour was a kind of a rant or fit ; 
that either it was the effect of some extraordinary 
levity that had come upon her, or that it was done 
to mimic the coquets of the town, believing it might 
take with me, who she thought was a Frenchman, and 
that it was what I loved. But her new gravity was 
her real natural temper, and indeed it became her so 
much 'better, or, as I should say, she acted it so well, 
[31] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

that it really brought me back to have, not as much 
only, but more mind to her than ever I had before. 

However, it was a great while before I discovered 
myself, and I stayed indeed to find out, if possible, 
whether this change was real or counterfeit ; for I 
could not easily believe it was possible the gay 
humour she used to appear in could be a counterfeit. 
It was not, therefore, till a year and almost a quarter 
that I came to any resolution in my thoughts about 
her, when, on a mere accident, we came to a little 
conversation together. 

She came to visit at our house as usual, and it 
happened all the ladies were gone abroad ; but, as it 
fell out, I was in the passage or entry of the house, 
going towards the stairs, when she knocked at the 
door ; so, stepping back, I opened the door, and she, 
without any ceremony, came in, and ran forward into 
the parlour, supposing the women had been there. 
I went in after her, as I could do no less, because 
she did not know that the family was abroad. 

Upon my coming in she asked for the ladies. I 
told her I hoped she came to visit me now, for that 
the ladies were all gone abroad. " Are they ? * said 
she, as if surprised — though I understood afterwards 
she knew it before, as also that I was at home — and 
then rises up to be gone. "No, madam," said I, 
" pray do not go ; when ladies come to visit me, I 
do not use to tire them of my company so soon." 
[32] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

u That 'fc as 'ill-natured," says she, " as you could 
possibly talk. Pray don't pretend I came to visit 
you. I am satisfied who I came to visit, and satis- 
fied that you know it." "Yes, madam," said I; 
" but if I happen to be all of the family that 's left 
at home, then you came to visit me." 

"I never receive visits from those that I hate," 
says she. 

" You have me there, indeed," said I ; " but you 
never gave me leave to tell you why I hated you. I 
hated you because you would never give me an 
opportunity to tell you I loved you. Sure, you took 
me for some frightful creature, that you would never 
come near enough so much as to let me whisper to 
you that I love you." 

" I never care to hear anything so disagreeable," 
says she, " though it be spoken ever so softly." 

We rallied thus for an hour. In short, she 
showed the abundance of her wit, and I an abun- 
dant deficiency of mine ; for though three or four 
times she provoked me to the last degree, so that 
once I was going to tell her I had enough of her 
company, and, if she pleased I would wait upon 
her to the door, yet she had always so much witch- 
craft on her tongue that she brought herself off 
again ; till, to make the story short, we came at last 
to talk seriously on both sides about matrimony, and 
she heard me freely propose it, and answered me 
vol.h.— S [33] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

directly upon many occasions. For example, she 
told me I would carry her away to France or to 
Virginia, and that she could not think of leaving 
England, her native country. I told her I hoped 
she did not take me for a kidnapper. (By the way, 
I did not tell her how I had been kidnapped my- 
self.) She said no; but the consequence of my 
affairs, which were, it seems, mostly abroad, might 
oblige me to go, and she could never think of marry- 
ing any man that she could not be content to go all 
over the world with, if he had occasion to go himself. 
This was handsomely expressed indeed. I made her 
easy on that point, and thus we began the grand 
parley; which indeed she drew me into with the utmost 
art and subtilty, such as was peculiar to herself, but 
was infinitely her advantage in our treating of mar- 
riage ; for she made me effectually court her, though at 
the same time in her design she courted me with the 
utmost skill, and such skill it was that her design 
was perfectly impenetrable to the last moment. 

In short, we came nearer and nearer every time we 
met ; and after one casual visit more, in which I had 
the mighty favour of talking with her alone, I then 
waited on her every day at her own house, or 
lodgings rather, and so we set about the work to 
a purpose, and in about a month we gave the world 
the slip, and were privately married, to avoid cere- 
mony and the public inconveniency of a wedding. 
[84] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

We soon found a house proper for our dwelling, 
and so went to housekeeping. We had not been 
long together but I found that gay temper of my 
wife returned, and she threw off the mask of her 
gravity and good conduct, that. I had so long fancied 
was her mere natural disposition ; and now, having 
no more occasion for disguises, she resolved to seem 
nothing but what really she was, a wild, untamed 
colt, perfectly loose, and careless to conceal any part, 
no, not the worst of her conduct. 

She carried on this air of levity to such an excess 
that I could not but be dissatisfied at the expense 
of it; for she kept company that I did not like, 
lived beyond what I could support, and sometimes 
lost at play more than I cared to pay. Upon which, 
one day, I took occasion to mention it, but lightly ; 
and said to her, by way of raillery, that we lived 
merrily, for as long as it would last She turned 
short upon me, "What do you mean?" says she. 
"Why, you don't pretend to be uneasy, do ye?" 
" No, no, madam, not I, by no means ; it is no busi- 
ness of mine, you know," said I, " to inquire what 
my wife spends, or whether she spends more than I 
can afford, or less. I only desire the favour to know, 
as near as you can guess, how long you will please to 
take to despatch me, for I would not be too long 
a-dying." 

"I do not know what you talk of," says she, 
[36] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

"You may die as leisurely, or as hastily, as you 
please, when your time comes ; I a'nt a-going to kill 
you, as I know of." 

" But you are a-going to starve me, madam," said 
I, "and hunger is as leisurely a death as breaking 
upon the wheel." 

" I starve you ! Why, are not you a great Vir- 
ginia merchant, and did not I bring you £1500? 
What would you have ? Sure, you can maintain a 
wife out of that, can't you ?" 

" Yes, madam," says I, " I could maintain a wife, 
but not a gamester, though you had brought me 
<£1500 a year; no estate is big enough for a box 
and dice." 

She took fire at that, and flew out in a passion, 
and after a great many bitter words, told me, in 
short, that she saw no occasion to alter her conduct ; 
and as for my not maintaining her, when I could 
not maintain her longer she would find some way or 
other to maintain herself. 

Some time after the first rattle of this kind, she 
vouchsafed to let me know that she was pleased to be 
with child. I was at first glad of it, in hopes it 
would help to abate her madness ; but it was all one, 
and her being with child only added to the rest, for 
she made such preparations for her lying-in, and the 
other appendixes of a child's being born, that, in 
short, I found she would be downright distracted. 
[36] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

And I took the liberty to tell her one day that she 
would soon bring herself and me to destruction, and 
entreated her to consider that such figures as those 
were quite above us, and out of our circle ; and, in . 
short, that I neither could nor would allow such ex- 
penses; that, at this rate, two or three children 
would effectually ruin me, and that I desired her to 
consider what she was doing. 

She told me, with an air of disdain, that it was 
none of her business to consider anything of that 
matter ; that if I could not allow it, she would al- 
low it herself, and I might do my worst. 

I begged her to consider things for all that, and 
not drive me to extremities ; that I married her to 
love and cherish her, and use her as a good wife 
ought to be used, but not to be ruined and undone 
by her. In a word, nothing could mollify her, nor 
any argument persuade her to moderation, but withal 
she took it so heinously that I should pretend to 
restrain her, that she told me in so many words she 
would drop her burthen with me, and then, if I did 
not like it, she would take care of herself; she 
would not live with me an hour, for she would not 
be restrained, not she ; and talked a long while at 
that rate. 

I told her, as to her child, which she called her 
burthen, it should be no burthen to me ; as to the 
rest, she might do as she pleased ; it might, how- 
[87] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

ever, do me this favour, that I should have no more 
lyings in at the rate of £136 at a time, as I found 
she intended it should be now. She told me she 
could not tell that ; if she had no more by me, she 
hoped she should by somebody else. u Say you so, 
madam ?" said I. "Then they that get them shall 
keep them." She did not know that neither, she 
said, and so turned it off jeering, and, as it were, 
laughing at me. 

This last discourse nettled me, I must confess, 
and the more because I had a great deal of it and 
very often, till, in short, we began at length to enter 
into a friendly treaty about parting. 

Nothing could be more criminal than the several 
discourses we had upon this subject. She demanded 
a separate maintenance, and, in particular, at the 
rate of £300 a year, and I demanded security of her 
that she should not run me in debt. She demanded 
the keeping of the child, with an allowance of i?100 
a year for that, and I demanded that I should be 
secured from being charged for keeping any she 
might have by somebody else, as she had threatened 
me. 

In the interval, and during these contests, she 
dropped her burthen (as she called it), and brought 
me a son, a very fine child* 

She was content during her lying-in to abate a 
little, though it was but a very little indeed, of the 
[88] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

great expense she had intended, and, with some diffi- 
culty and persuasion, was content with a suit of 
child-bed linen of j£15 instead of one she had in- 
tended of threescore ; and this she magnified as a 
particular testimony of her condescension and a 
yielding to my avaricious temper, as she called it. 
But after she was up again, it was the same thing, 
and she went on with her humour to that degree 
that in a little time she began to carry it on to other 
excesses, and to have a sort of fellows come to visit 
her, which I did not like, and once, in particular, 
stayed abroad all night The next day, when she 
came home, she began to cry out first; told me 
where (as she said) she lay, and that the occasion 
was a christening, where the company had a feast 
and stayed too late ; that, if I was dissatisfied, I 
might inform myself there of all the particulars, 
where she lay, and the like. I told her coldly, 
" Madam, you do well to suggest my being dissatis- 
fied, for you may be sure I am, and you could expect 
no other ; that as to going to your haunts to inform 
myself, that is not. my business : it is your business 
to bring testimonies of your behaviour, and to prove 
where you lay, and in what company. It is enough 
to me that you lay out of your own house, without 
your husband's knowledge or consent, and before yoii 
and I converse again I must have some satisfaction 
of the particulars." 

[89] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

She answered, with all her heart ; she was as in- 
different as I ; and since I took so ill her lying at a 
friend's house on an extraordinary occasion, she gave 
me to understand that it was what she would have 
me expect, and what she would have the liberty to 
do when she thought fit 

" Well, madam, 1 " said I, " if I must expect what I 
cannot allow, you must expect I shall shut my doors 
by day against those that keep out of them at 
night" 

She would try me, she said, very speedily; and 
if I shut the doors against her, she would find a way 
to make me open them. 

" Well, madam," says I, 4t you threaten me hard, 
but I would advise you to consider before you take 
such measures, for I shall be as good as my word." 
However, it was not long that we could live together 
upon these terms; for I found very quickly what 
company she kept, and that she took a course which 
I ought not to bear. So I began the separation first, 
and refused her my bed. We had indeed refrained 
all converse as husband and wife for about two 
months before, for I told her very plainly I would 
father no brats that were not of my own getting ; 
and matters coming thus gradually to an extremity, 
too great to continue as it was, she went off one 
afternoon, and left me a line in writing, signifying 
that affairs had come to such a pass between us that 
[40] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

she did not think fit to give me the opportunity of 
shutting her out of doors, and that therefore she 
had retired herself to such a place, naming a rela- 
tion of her own, as scandalous as herself; and that 
she hoped I would not give her the trouble to sue 
for her support in the ordinary course of law, but 
that, as her occasions required, she should draw bills 
upon me, which she expected I would not refuse. 

I was extremely satisfied with this proceeding, 
and took care to let her hear of it, though I gave 
no answer at all to her letter ; and as" I had taken 
care before that whenever she played such a prank 
as this, she should not be able to carry much with 
her, so, after she was gone, I immediately broke up 
house-keeping, sold my furniture by public outcry, 
and in it everything in particular that was her own, 
and set a bill upon my door, giving her to under- 
stand by it that she had passed the Rubicon, that 
as she had taken such a step of her own accord, so 
there was no room left her ever to think of coming 
back again. 

This was what any one may believe I should not 
have done if I had seen any room for a reformation ; 
but she had given me such testimonies of a mind 
alienated from her husband, in particular espousing 
her own unsufferable levity, that there was indeed 
no possibility of our coming afterwards to any terms 
again. 

[41] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

However, I kept a couple of trusty agents so near 
her that I failed not to have a full account of her 
conduct, though I never let her know anything of 
me but that I was gone over to France. As to her 
bills which she said she would draw upon me, she 
was as good as her word in drawing one of jPSO, 
which I refused to accept, and never gave her leave 
to trouble me with another. 

It is true, and I must acknowledge it, that all this 
was a very melancholy scene of life to me, and but 
that she took care by carrying herself to the last 
degree provoking, and continually to insult me, I 
could never have gone on to the parting with so 
much resolution ; for I really loved her very sin- 
cerely, and could have been anything but a beggar 
and a cuckold with her, but those were intolerable 
to me, especially as they were put upon me with so 
much insult and rudeness. 

But my wife carried it at last to a point that 
made all things light and easy to me, for after above 
a year's separation, and keeping such company as she 
thought fit, she wa# pleased to be with child again, 
in which she had, however, so much honesty as not 
to pretend that she had had anything to do with 
me. What a wretched life she led after this, and 
how she brought herself to the utmost extremity of 
misery and distress, I may speak of hereafter. 

I had found, soon after our parting, that I had a 
[42] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

great deal of reason to put myself into a posture at 
first not to be imposed upon by her ; for I found 
very quickly that she had run herself into debt in 
several places very considerably, and that it was 
upon a supposition that I was liable to those debts. 
But I was gone, and it was absolutely necessary 
I should do so; upon which she found herself 
obliged, out of her wicked gains, however, whatever 
she made of them, to discharge most of those debts 
herself. 

As soon as she was delivered of her child, in which 
my intelligence was so good that I had gotten suffi- 
cient proof of it, I sued her in the ecclesiastical court, 
in order to obtain a divorce ; and as she found it im- 
possible to avoid it, so she declined the defence, and 
I gained a legal decree, or what they call it, of 
divorce, in the usual time of such process ; and now 
I thought myself a free man once again, and began 
to be sick of wedlock with all my heart. 

I lived retired, because I knew she had contracted 
debts which I should be obliged to pay, and I was 
resolved to be gone out of her reach with what speed 
I could. But it was necessary that I should stay till 
the Virginia fleet came in, because I looked for at 
least three hundred hogsheads of tobacco from 
thence, which I knew would heal all my breaches ; 
for indeed the extravagance of three years with this 
lady had sunk me most effectually, even far beyond 
[48] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

her own fortune, which was considerable, though not 
quite i?1500, as she had called it. 

But all the mischiefs I met with on account of 
this match were not over yet ; for when I had been 
parted with her about three months, and had re- 
fused to accept her bill of i?30, which I mentioned 
above, though I was removed from my first lodgings 
too, and thought I had effectually secured myself 
from being found out, yet there came a gentleman 
well dressed to my lodgings one day, and was let in 
before I knew of it, or else I should scarce have 
admitted him. * 

He was led into a parlour, and I came down to 
him in my gown and slippers. When I came into 
the room he called me as familiarly by my name as 
if he had known me twenty years, and pulling out 
a pocket-book, he shows me a bill upon me, drawn 
by my wife, which was the same bill for £30 that I 
had refused before. 

" Sir," says I, " this bill has been presented be- 
fore, and I gave my answer to it then." 

u Answer, sir ! " says he, with a kind of jeering, 
taunting air. " I do not understand what you mean 
by an answer ; it is not a question, sir ; it is a bill to 
be paid." 

" Well, sir," says I, " it is a bill ; I know that, and 
I gave my answer to it before." 

"Sir, sir," says he very saucily, "your answer! 
[44] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

There is no answer to a bill ; it must be paid. Bills 
are to be paid, not to be answered. They say you 
are a merchant, sir; merchants always pay their 
bills." 

I began to be angry too a little, but I did not 
like my man, for I found he began to be quarrelsome. 
However, I said, " Sir, I perceive you are not much 
used to presenting bills. Sir, a bill is always first 
presented, and presenting is a question ; it is asking 
if I will accept or pay the bill, and then whether I 
say yes or no, it is an answer one way or other. 
After ^tis accepted, it indeed requires no more an- 
swer but payment when 't is due. If you please to 
inform yourself, this is the usage which all merchants 
or tradesmen of any kind who have bills drawn upon 
them act by." 

44 Well, sir," says he, " and what then ? What is 
this to the paying me the <f30 ? " 

44 Why, sir," says 1, 44 it is this to it, that I told 
the person that brought it I should not pay it." 

44 Not pay it ! " says he. 44 But you shall pay it ; 
ay, ay, you will pay it." 

44 She that draws it has no reason to draw any 
bills upon me, I am sure," said I ; " and I shall pay 
no bills she draws, I assure you." 

Upon this he turns short upon me : 44 Sir, she that 
draws this bill is a person of too much honour to 
draw any bill without reason, and 'tis an affront to 
[45] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE, 

say so of her, and I shall expect satisfaction of you 
for that by itself. But first the bill, sir — the bill ; 
you must pay the bill, sir." 

I returned as short: "Sir, I affront nobody. I 
know the person as well as you, I hope ; and what 
I have said of her is no affront. She can have no 
reason to draw bills upon me, for I owe her nothing." 

I omit intermingling the oaths he laced his speech 
with, as too foul for my paper. But he told me he 
would make me know she had friends to stand by her, 
that I had abused her, and he would let me know it, 
and do her justice. But first I must pay his bill. 

I answered, in short, I would not pay the bill, nor 
any bills she should draw. 

With that he steps to the door and shuts it, and 
swore by G — d he would make me pay the bill 
before we parted, and laid his hand upon his sword, 
but did not draw it out. 

I confess I was frighted to the last degree, for I 
had no sword ; and if I had, I must own that, though 
I had learned a great many good things in France to 
make me look like a gentleman, I had forgot the 
main article of learning how to use a sword, a thing 
so universally practised there ; and, to say more, I 
had been perfectly unacquainted with quarrels of 
this nature ; so that I was perfectly surprised when 
he shut the door, and knew not what to say or do. 

However, as it happened, the people of the house, 
[46] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

bearing us pretty loud, came near the door, and 
made a noise in the entry to let me know they were 
at hand ; and one of the servants, going to open the 
door, and finding it locked, called out to me, " Sir, 
for God's sake open the door ! What is the matter ? 
Shall we fetch a constable?" I made no answer, 
but it gave me courage ; so I sat down composed in 
one of the chairs, and said to him, " Sir, this is not 
the way to make me pay the bill; you had much 
better be easy, and take your satisfaction another 
way." 

He understood me of fighting, which, upon my 
word, was not in my thoughts ; but I meant that he 
had better take his course at law. 

" With all my heart," says he ; " they say you are 
a gentleman, and they call you colonel. Now, if 
you are a gentleman, I accept your challenge, sir ; 
and if you will walk out with me, I will take it for 
full payment of the bill, and will decide it as gentle- 
men ought to do." 

" I challenge you, sir ! " said I. " Not I ; I made 
no challenge," I said. " This is not the way to make 
me pay a bill that I have not accepted ; that is, that 
you had better seek your satisfaction at law." 

" Law ! " says he ; " law ! Gentlemen's law is my 
law. In short, sir, you shall pay me or fight me." 
And then, as if he had mistaken, he turns short upon 
me, " Nay," says he, " you shall both fight me and 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

pay me, for I will maintain her honour;" and in 
saying this he bestowed about six or seven " damme's " 
and oaths, by way of parenthesis. 

This interval delivered me effectually, for just at 
the words " fight me, for I will maintain her honour," 
the maid had brought in a constable, with three or 
four neighbours to assist him. 

He heard them come in, and began to be a little 
in a rage, and asked me if I intended to mob him in- 
stead of paying ; and laying his hand on his sword, 
told me, if any man offered to break in upon him, he 
would run me through the first moment, that he 
might have the fewer to deal with afterwards. 

I told him he knew I had called for no help (be- 
lieving he could not be in earnest in what he had 
said), and that, if anybody attempted to come in 
upon us, it was to prevent the mischief he threatened, 
and which he might see I had no weapons to resist. 

Upon this the constable called, and charged us 
both in the king's name to open the door. I was 
sitting in a chair, and offered to rise. He made a 
motion as if he would draw, upon which I sat down 
again, and the door not being opened, the constable 
set his foot against it and came in. 

" Well, sir," says my gentleman, " and what now ? 
What's your business here?" "Nay, sir," says the 
constable, "you see my business. I am a peace- 
officer ; all I have to do is to keep the peace, and I 
[48] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

find the people of the house frightened for fear of 
mischief between you, and they have fetched me to 
prevent it" "What mischief have they supposed 
you should find ? " says he. " I suppose," says the 
constable, " they were afraid you should fight." 
"Thaf's because they did not know this fellow here. 
He never fights. They call him colonel," says he. 
f I suppose he might be born a colonel, for I dare 
say he was born a coward ; he never fights ; he dares 
not see a man. If he would have fought, he would 
have walked out with me, but he scorns to be brave ; 
they would never have talked to you of fighting if 
they had known him. I tell you, Mr. Constable, he 
is a coward, and a coward is a rascal ;" and with 
that he came to me, and stroked his finger down my 
nose pretty hard, and laughed and mocked most 
horribly, as if I was a coward. Now, for aught I 
knew, it might be true, but I was now what they 
call a coward made desperate, which is one of the 
worst of men in the world to encounter with ; for, 
being in a fury, I threw my head in his face, and 
closing with him, threw him fairly on ' his back by 
mere strength ; and had not the constable stepped in 
and taken me off, I had certainly stamped him to 
death with my feet, for my blood was now all in a 
flame, and the people of the house were frighted now 
as much the other way, lest I should kill him, though 
I had no weapon at all in my hand, 
vox- «.— 4 [ 49 ] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

The constable too reproved me in his turn ; but 
I said to him, " Mr. Constable, do you not think I 
am sufficiently provoked ? Can any man bear such 
things as these ? I desire to know who this man is 
and who sent him hither." 

" 1 am," says he, " a gentleman, and come with a 
bill to him for money, and he refuses to pay it." 
" Well," says the constable very prudently, " that is 
none of my business ; I am no justice of the peace to 
hear the cause. Be that among yourselves, but keep 
your hands off one another, and that is as much as 
I desire; and therefore, sir," says the constable to 
him, " if I may advise you, seeing he will not pay 
the bill, and that must be decided between you as 
the law directs, I would have you leave it for the 
present and go quietly away." 

He made many impertinent harangues about the 
bill, and insisted that it was drawn by my own wife. 
I said angrily, "Then it was drawn by a whore." 
He bullied me upon that, told me I durst not tell 
him so anywhere else ; so I answered, " I would very 
soon publish her for a whore to all the world, and 
cry her down;" and thus we scolded for near half- 
an-hour, for I took courage when the constable was 
there, for I knew that he would keep us from fight- 
ing, which indeed I had no mind to, and so at length 
I got rid of him. 

I was heartily vexed at this rencounter, and the

more because I had been found out in my lodging, 
which I thought I had effectually concealed. How- 
ever, I resolved to remove the next day, and in the 
meantime I kept within doors all that day till the 
evening, and then I went out in order not to return 
thither any more. . 

Being come out into Gracechurch Street, I ob- 
served a man follow me, with one of his legs tied up 
in a string, and hopping along with the other, and 
two crutches ; he begged for a farthing, but I inclin- 
ing not to give him anything, the fellow followed 
me still, till I came to a court, when I answered 
hastily to him, " I have nothing for you ! Fray do 
not be so troublesome ! " with which words he 
knocked me down with one of his crutches. 

Being stunned with the blow, I knew nothing 
what was done to me afterwards; but coming to 
myself again, I found I was wounded very fright- 
fully in several places, and that among the rest my 
nose was slit upwards, one of my ears cut almost off, 
and a great cut with a sword on the side^of the fore- 
head; also a stab into the body, though not dan- 
gerous. 

Who had been near me, or struck me, besides the 
cripple that struck me with his crutch, I knew not, 
nor do I know to this hour; but I was terribly 
wounded, and lay bleeding on the ground some time, 
till, coming to myself, I got strength to cry out for 
[51] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

help, and people coming about me, I got some hands 
to carry me to my lodging, where I lay by it more 
than two months before I was well enough to go out 
of doors ; and when I did go out, I had reason to 
believe that I was waited for by some rogues, who 
watched an opportunity to repeat the injury I had 
met with before. 

This made me very uneasy, and I resolved to get 
myself out of danger if possible, and to go over to 
France, or home, as I called it, to Virginia, so to be 
out of the way of villains and assassinations ; for 
every time I stirred out here I thought I went in 
danger of my life ; and therefore, as before, I went 
out at night, thinking to be concealed, so now I 
never went out but in open day, that I might be 
safe, and never without one pr two servants to be 
my lifeguard. 

But I must do my wife a piece of justice here too, 
and that was, that, hearing what had befallen me, 
she wrote me a letter, in which she treated me more 
decently than she had been wont to do. She said 
she was very sorry to hear how I had been used, and 
the rather because she understood it was on present- 
ing her bill to me. She said she hoped I could not, 
in my worst dispositions, think so hardly of her as 
to believe it was done by her knowledge or consent, 
much less by her order or direction ; that she ab- 
horred such things, and protested, if she had the 
[52] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

least knowledge or so much as a guess at the villains 
concerned, she would discover them to me. She let 
me know the person's name to whom she gave the 
bill, and where he lived, and left it to me to oblige 
him to discover the person who had brought it and 
used me so ill, and wished I might find him and 
bring him to justice, and have him punished with 
the utmost severity of the law. 

I took this so kindly of my wife that I think in 
my conscience, had she come after it herself to see 
how I did, I had certainly taken her again ; but she 
satisfied herself with the civility of another letter, 
and desiring me to let her know as often as I could 
how I was ; adding that it would be infinitely to 
her satisfaction to hear I was recovered of the hurt 
I had received, and that he was hanged at Tyburn 
who had done it 

She used some expressions signifying, as I under- 
stood them, her affliction at our parting and her con- 
tinued respect for me ; but did not make any motion 
towards returning. Then she used some arguments 
to move me to pay her bills, intimating that she had 
brought me a large fortune, and now had nothing to 
subsist on, which was very severe. 

I wrote her an answer to this letter, though I had 

not to the other, letting her know how I had been 

used ; that I was satisfied, upon her letter, that she 

had no band in it ; that it was not in t)CT nature to 

[53] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

treat me so, who had never injured her, used any 
violence with ber, or been the cause or desire of our 
parting ; that, as to her bill, she could not but know 
how much her expensive way of living had straitened 
and reduced me, and would, if continued, have ruined 
me ; that she had in less than three years spent more 
than as much as she brought to me, and would not 
abate her expensive way, though calmly entreated by 
me, with protestations that I could not support so 
great an expense, but chose rather to break up her 
family and go from me than to restrain herself to 
reasonable limits; though I used no violence with 
her, but entreaties and earnest persuasions, backed 
with good reason ; letting her know how my estate 
was, and convincing her that it must reduce us to 
poverty at least ; that, however, if she would recall 
her bill, I would send her £30, which was the sum 
mentioned in her bill, and, according to my ability, 
would not let her want, if she pleased to live within 
due bounds ; but then I let her know also that I 
had a very bad account of ber conduct, and that she 
kept company with a scandalous fellow, who I named 
to her; that I was loth to believe such things of 
her, but that, to put an entire end to the report and 
restore her reputation, I let her know that still, after 
all I heard, if she would resolve to live without re- 
straints, within the reasonable bounds of my capacity, 
and .treat me with the same kindness, affection, and 
[54] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

tenderness as I always had treated her, and ever 
would, I was willing to receive her again, and would 
forget all that was past ; but that, if she declined 
me now, it would be for ever ; for if she did not 
accept my offer, I was resolved to stay here no 
longer, where I had been so ill-treated on many 
occasions, but was preparing to go into my own 
country, where I would spend my days in quiet, and 
in a retreat from the world. 

She did not give such an answer to this as I ex- 
pected ; for though she thanked me for the £30, yet 
she insisted upon her justification in all other points ; 
and though she did not refuse to return to me, yet 
she did not say she accepted it, and, in short, said 
little or nothing to it, only a kind of claim to a 
reparation of her injured reputation, and the like. 

This gave me some surprise at first, for I thought, 
indeed, any woman in her circumstances would have 
been very willing to have put an end to all her 
miseries, and to the reproach which was upon her, 
by a reconciliation, especially considering she sub- 
sisted at that time but very meanly. But there was 
a particular reason which prevented her return, and 
which she could not plead to in her letter, yet was a 
good reason against accepting an offer which she 
would otherwise have been glad of; and this was, 
that, as I have mentioned above, she had fallen into 
bad company, and had. prostituted her virtue to 
[55] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

some of her flatterers, and, in short, was with child ; 
so that she durst not venture to accept my offer. 

However, as I observed above, she did not abso- 
lutely refuse it, intending (as I understood afterward) 
to keep the treaty of it on foot till she could drop 
her burthen, as she had called it before, and having 
been delivered privately, have accepted my proposal 
afterward ; and, indeed, this was the most prudent 
step she could take, or, as we may say, the only step 
she had left to take. But I was too many for her 
here too. My intelligence about her was too good 
for her to conceal such an affair from me, unless she 
had gone away before she was visibly big, and unless 
she had gone farther off too than she did ; for I had 
an account to a tittle of the time when, and place 
where, and the creature of which she was delivered ; 
and then my offers of taking her again were at an 
end, though she wrote me several very penitent 
letters, acknowledging her crime and begging me to 
forgive her. But my spirit was above all that now, 
nor could I ever bear the thoughts of her after that, 
but pursued a divorce, and accordingly obtained it, 
as I have mentioned already. 

Things being at this pass, I resolved, as I have 
observed before, to go over to France, after I had 
received my effects from Virginia ; and accordingly I 

came to Dunkirk in the year , and here I fell 

into company with some Irish officers of the regi- 
— -.. [66] 



THE LIFE OP COLONEL JACQUE 

ment of Dillon, who by little and little entered me 
into the army, and by the help of Lieutenant-General 

, an Irishman, and some money, I obtained a 

company in his regiment, and so went into the army 
directly. 

I was exceeding pleased with my new circum- 
stances, and now I used to say to myself I was come 
to what I was born to, and that I had never till now 
lived the life of a gentleman. 

Our regiment, after I had been some time in it, 
was commanded into Italy, and one of the most con- 
siderable actions that I was in was the famous at- 
tack upon Cremona, in the Milanese, where the 
Germans, being privately and by treachery let into 
the town in the night through a kind of common 
sewer, surprised the town and got possession of the 
greatest part of it, surprising the mareschal, Duke 
de Villeroi, and taking him prisoner as he came out 
of his quarters, and beating the few French troops 
which were left in the citadel ; but were in the 
middle of their victory so boldly and resolutely at- 
tacked by two Irish regiments who were quartered 
in the street leading to the river Po, and who kept 
possession of the water-gate, or Po gate, of the town, 
by which the German reinforcements should have 
come in, that, after a most desperate fight, the Ger- 
mans had their victory wrung out of their hands, 
and not being able to break through us to let in 
[57] 



THE LIFE OP COLONEL JACQUE 

their Mends, were obliged at length to quit the 
town again, to the eternal honour of those Irish regi- 
ments, and indeed of their whole nation, and for 
which we had a very handsome compliment from the 
king of France. 

I now had the satisfaction of knowing, and that 
for the first time too, that I was not that cowardly, 
low-spirited wretch that I was when the fellow bul- 
lied me in my lodgings about the bill of £SQ. Had 
he attacked me now, though in the very same condi- 
tion, I should, naked and unarmed as I was, have 
flown in the face of him and trampled him under my 
feet. But men never know themselves till they are 
tried, and courage is acquired by time and experience 
of things. 

Philip de Comines tells us that, after the battle 
of Monteleri, the Count de Charolois, who till then 
had an utter aversion to the war, and abhorred it and 
everything that belonged to it, was so changed by 
the glory he obtained in that action, and by the 
flattery of those about him, that afterwards the army 
was his mistress and the fatigues of the war his chief 
delight. It is too great an example for me to bring 
in my own case, but so it was, that they flattered me 
so with my bravery, as they called it, on the occa- 
sion of this action, that I fancied myself brave, 
whether I was so or not, and the pride of it made me 
bold and daring to the last degree on all occasions. 
[58] 



THE LIFE OP COLONEL JACQUE 

But what added to it was, that somebody gave a 
particular account to the Court of my being instru- 
mental to the saving the city, and the whole Cremo- 
nese, by my extraordinary defence of the Po gate, 
and by my managing that defence after the lieutenant- 
colonel who commanded the party where I was posted 
was killed ; upon which the king sent me a public 
testimony of his accepting my service, and sent me a 
brevet to be lieutenant-colonel, and the next courier 
brought me actually a commission for lieutenant- 
colonel in the regiment of . 

I was in several skirmishes and petty encounters 
before this, by which I gained the reputation of a 
good officer ; but I happened to be in some particular 
posts too, by which I got somewhat that I liked 
much better, and that was a good deal of money. 

Our regiment was sent from France to Italy by 
sea. We embarked at Toulon, and landed at Savona, 
in the territory of Genoa, and marched from thence 
to the duchy of Milan. At the first town we were 
sent to take possession of, which was Alexandria, the 
citizens rose upon our men in a most furious manner, 
and drove the whole garrison, which consisted of 
eight hundred men — that is, French and soldiers 
in the French service — quite out of the town. 

I was quartered in a burgher's house, just by one 
of the ports, with eight of my men and a servant, 
where, calling a short council with my men, we were 
[59] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

resolved to maintain the bouse we were in, whatever 
it cost, till we received orders to quit it from the 
commanding officer. Upon this, when I saw our 
men could not stand their ground in the street, 
being pressed hard by the citizens, I turned out of 
doors all the family, and kept the house as a castle, 
which I was governor in ; and as the house joined to 
the city gate, I resolved to maintain it, so as to be 
the last that should quit the place, my own retreat 
being secured by being so near the port. 

Having thus emptied the house of the inhabitants, 
we made no scruple of filling our pockets with what- 
ever we could find there. In a word, we left nothing 
we could carry away, among which it came to my 
lot to dip into the burgher's cabinet whose house it 
was where we were, and there I took about the quan- 
tity of two hundred pistoles in money and plate, 
and other things of value. There was great com- 
plaint made to Prince Vaudemont, who was then 
governor of the Milanese, of this violence. But as 
the repulse the citizens gave us was contrary to his 
order, and to the general design of the prince, who 
was then wholly in the interest of King Philip, the 
citizens could obtain nothing ; and I found that if 
we had plundered the whole city it would have been 
the same thing ; for the governor had orders to take 
our regiment in, and it was an act of open rebellion 
to resist us as they did. However, we had orders 
[60] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

not to fire upon the burghers, unless constrained 
to it by evident necessity, and we rather chose to 
quit the place as we did than dispute it with a des- 
perate body of fellows, who wanted no advantage of 
us, except only that of having possession of two 
bastions and one port of our retreat. First, they 
were treble our number; for the burghers, being 
joined by seven companies of the regular troops, 
made up above sixteen hundred men, besides rabble, 
which was many more, whereas we were about eight 
hundred in all ; they also had the citadel and several 
pieces of cannon, so that we could have made nothing 
of it if we had attacked them. But they submitted 
three or four days after to other forces, the soldiers 
within turning upon them and taking the citadel 
from them. 

After this we lay still in quarters eight months. 
For the prince, having secured the whole Milanese for 
King Philip, and no enemy appearing for some time, 
had nothing to do but to receive the auxiliary 
troops of France, and as they came, extend himself 
every way as he could, in order to keep the imperial- 
ists (who were preparing to fall into Italy with a 
great army) as much at a distance as possible, which 
he did by taking possession of the city of Mantua, 
and of most of the towns on that side, as far as the 
Lake De la Guarda and the river Adige. 

We lay in Mantua some time, but were afterwards 
[61] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

drawn out by order of the Count de Tesse (after- 
wards Marshal of France), to form the French army, 
till the arrival of the Duke de Vendome, who was to 
command in chief. Here we had a severe campaign, 
anno 1701, having Prince Eugene of Savoy and an 
army of forty thousand Germans, all old soldiers, to 
deal with ; and though the French army was more 
numerous than the enemy by twenty-five thousand 
men, yet, being on the defensive, and having so 
many posts to cover, not knowing exactly where the 
Prince of Savoy* who commanded the imperial army, 
would attack us, it obliged the French to keep their 
troops so divided and so remote from one another 
that the Germans pushed on their design with great 
success, as the histories of those times more fully 
relate. 

I was at the action of Carpi, July 1701, where we 
were worsted by the Germans ; indeed, were forced 
to quit our encampment and give up to the prince 
the whole river Adige, and where our regiment sus- 
tained some loss. But the enemies got little by us, 
and Monsieur Catinat, who commanded at that 
time, drew up in order of battle the next day in 
sight of the German army, and gave them a de- 
fiance; but they would not stir, though we offered 
them battle two days together ; for, having gained 
the passage over the Adige by our quitting Rivoli, 
which was then useless to us, their business was done. 
[62] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

Finding they declined a decisive action, our 
generals pressed them in their quarters, and made 
them fight for every inch of ground they gained; 
and at length, in the September following, we at- 
tacked them in their intrenched posts of Chiar. 
Here we broke into the very heart of their camp, 
where we made a very terrible slaughter. But I 
know not by what mistake among our generals, or 
defect in the execution of their orders, the brigade 
of Normandy and our Irish Brigade, who had so 
bravely entered the German intrenchments, were not 
supported as we should have been, so that we were 
obliged to sustain the shock of the whole German 
army, and at last to quit the advantage we had 
gained, and that not without loss ; but, being 
timely reinforced by a great body of horse, the 
enemy were in their turn beaten off too, and driven 
back into their very camp. The Germans boasted 
of having a great victory here, and indeed, in re- 
pulsing us after we had gained their camp, they had 
the advantage. But had Monsieur de Tesse suc- 
coured us in time, as old Catinat said he ought to 
have done, with twelve thousand foot which he had 
with him, that day's action had put an end to the 
war, and Prince Eugene must have been glad to 
have gone back to Germany in more haste than he 
came, if, perhaps, we had not cut him short by the 
way. 

[63] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

But the fate of things went another way, and the 
Germans continued all that campaign to push for- 
ward and advance one post after another, till they 
. beat us quite out of the Milanese. 

The latter part of this campaign we made only a 
party war, the French, according to their volatile 
temper, being every day abroad, either foraging or 
surprising the enemy's foragers, plundering or cir- 
cumventing the plunders of the other side. But 
they very often came short home, for the Germans 
had the better of them on several occasions; and 
indeed so many lost their lives upon these petty 
encounters that I think, including those who died 
of distempers gotten by hard service and bad quar- 
ters, lying in the field even till the middle of Decem- 
ber among rivers and bogs, in a country so full of 
canals and rivers as that part of Italy is known to 
be ; I say, we lost more men, and so did the enemy 
also, than would have been lost in a general decisive 
battle. 

The Duke of Savoy, to give him his due, pressed 
earnestly to put it to a day and come to a battle 
with Prince Eugene; but the Duke de Villeroi, 
Monsieur Catinat, and the Count de Tesse were all 
against it ; and the principal reason was, that they 
knew the weakness of the troops, who had suffered so 
much on so many occasions that they were in no 
condition to give battle to the Germans. So after, 
[64] 



THE LIFE QF COLONEL JACQUE 

as I say, about three months' harassing one another 
with parties, we went into winter quarters. 

Before we marched out of the field, our regiment, 
with a detachment of dragoons of six hundred, and 
about two hundred and fifty horse, went out with a 
design to intercept Prince Com mercy, a general of 
note under Prince Eugene of Savoy. The detach- 
ment was intended to be only horse and dragoons ; 
but because it was the imperialists' good luck to beat 
many of our parties, and, as was given out, many 
more than we beat of theirs, and because it was be- 
lieved that the prince, who was an officer of good 
note among them, would not go abroad but in very 
good company, the Irish regiment of foot was ordered 
to be added, that, if possible, they might meet with 
their match. 

I was commanded, about two hours before, to pass 
about two hundred foot and fifty dragoons at a small 
wood where our general had intelligence that prince 
would post some men to secure his passage, which 
accordingly I did. But Count Tesse, not thinking 
our party strong enough, had marched himself, with 
a thousand horse and three hundred grenadiers, to 
support us. And it was very well he did so; for 
Prince Commercy, having intelligence of the first 
party, came forward sooner than they expected, and 
fell upon them, and had entirely routed them had 
not the Count, hearing the firing, advanced with the 
vou u. — 5 [ 65 ] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

thousand horse he had, with such expedition as to 
support his men in the very heat of the action, by 
which means the Germans were defeated and forced 
to retire. But the prince made a pretty good re- 
treat, and after the action came on to the wood 
where I was posted ; but the surprise of his defeat 
had prevented his sending a detachment to secure 
the pass at the wood, as he intended. 

The Count de Tesse, understanding that we were 
sent, as above, to the wood, followed them close at 
the heels, to prevent our being cut off, and, if it were 
possible that we should give them any check at the 
wood, to fall in and have another brush with them. 
It was near night before they came to the wood, by 
which means they could not discern our number. 
But when they came up to the wood, fifty dragoons 
advanced to discover the pass and see if all was clear. 
These we suffered to pass a great way into the defile, 
or lane, that went through the wood, and then clap- 
ping in between them and the entrance, cut off their 
retreat so effectually that when they discovered us 
and fired, they were instantly surrounded and cut in 
pieces, the officers who commanded them and eight 
dragoons only being made prisoners. 

This made the prince halt, not knowing what the 

case was or how strong we were, and, to get better 

intelligence, sent two hundred horse to surround or 

skirt the wood and beat up our quarter, and in the 

[66] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

interim the Count de Tesse appeared in his rear. 
We found the strait he was in by the noise of our 
own troops at a distance ; so we resolved to engage 
the two hundred horse immediately. Accordingly 
our little troop of horse drew up in the entrance of 
the lane and offered to skirmish, and our foot, lying 
behind the hedge which went round the wood, stood 
ready to act as occasion should offer. The horse, 
being attacked, gave way, and retired into the lane ; 
but the Germans were too old for us there. They 
contented themselves to push us to the entrance, but 
would not be drawn into a narrow pass without know- 
ing whether the hedges were lined or no. 

But the prince, finding the French in his rear, and 
not being strong enough to engage again, resolved to 
force his way through, and commanded his dragoons 
to alight and enter the wood, to clear the hedges on 
either side the lane, that he might pass with his 
cavalry. This they did so vigorously, and were so 
much too strong for us, that though we made good 
our ground a long time, yet our men were almost 
half of them cut in pieces. However, we gave time 
to the French cavalry to come up, and to fall on the 
prince's troops and cut them off, and take a great 
many prisoners, and then we retreated in our turn, 
opening a gap for our own horse to break in. Three 
hundred of the dragoons were killed, and two hun- 
dred of them taken prisoners. 
[67] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

In the first heat of this action, a German officer 
of dragoons, well followed, had knocked down three 
men that stood next me ; and, offering me quarter, 
I was obliged to accept it, and gave him my sword ; 
for our men were upon the point of quitting their 
post and shifting every one as they could. But the 
scale was turned, for our cavalry breaking in, as 
above, the dragoons went to wreck, and the officer 
who had me prisoner, turning to me, said, " We are 
all lost" I asked him if I could serve him. " Stand 
still a little," says he ; for his men fought most des- 
perately indeed. But about two hundred French 
horse appearing in his rear too, he said to me in 
French, "I will be your prisoner," and returning 
me my sword, gave me also his own. A dragoon 
that stood near him was just going to do the like, 
when he was shot dead, and the horse coming up, the 
field was cleared in an instant. But Prince Corn- 
mercy went off with the rest of his party, and was 
pursued no farther. 

There were sixteen or seventeen of our men re- 
leased, as I was, from being taken ; but they had not 
the luck I had, to take the officer that had them in 
keeping. He had been so generous to me as not to 
ask what money I had about me, though I had not 
much if he had. But I lost by his civility, for then 
I could not have the assurance to ask him for his 
money, though I understood he had near a hundred 
[68] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

pistoles about him. But he very handsomely at 
night, when we came to our tents, made me a pres- 
ent of twenty pistoles, and in return I obtained leave 
for him to go to Prince Eugene's camp upon his 
parole, which he did, and so got himself exchanged. 

It was after this campaign that I was quartered at 
Cremona, when the action happened there of which 
I have spoken already, and where our Irish regiment 
did such service that they saved the town from being 
really surprised, and indeed beat the Germans out 
again, after they had been masters of three-quarters 
of the town six hours, and by which they gained a 
very great reputation. 

But I hasten on to my own history, for I am not 
writing a journal of the wars, in which I had no 
long share. 

The summer after this our two Irish regiments 
were drawn out into the field, and had many a sore 
brush with the Germans ; for Prince Eugene, a vigi- 
lant general, gave us little rest, and gained many 
advantages by his continual moving up and down, 
harassing his own men and ours too ; and whoever 
will do the French justice, and knew how they had 
behaved, must acknowledge they never declined the 
Germans, but fought them upon all occasions with 
the utmost resolution and courage ; and though it 
cost the blood of an infinite number of fine gentle- 
men, as well as private soldiers, yet the Duke de 
[69] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

Vendome, who now commanded, though King Philip 
was himself in the army this campaign, made the 
Prince of Savoy a full return in his own kind, and 
drove him from post to post, till he was just at the 
point of quitting the whole country of Italy. All 
that gallant army Prince Eugene brought with him 
into Italy, which was the best without doubt, for the 
goodness of the troops, that ever were there, laid 
their bones in that country, and many thousands more 
after them, till, the affairs of France declining in 
other places, they were forced in their turn to give 
way to their fate, as may be seen in the histories 
of those times, as above. But it is none of my 
business. 

The part that I bore in these affairs was but short 
and sharp. We took the field about the beginning 
of July 1702, and the Duke de Venddme ordered the 
whole army to draw the sooner together, in order to 
relieve the city of Mantua, which was blocked up by 
the imperialists. 

Prince Eugene was a politic, and indeed a for- 
tunate, prince, and had the year before pushed our 
army upon many occasions. But his good fortune 
began to fail him a little this year, for our army was 
not only more numerous than his, but the duke was 
in the field before him ; and as the prince had held 
Mantua closely blocked up all the winter, the duke re- 
solved to relieve the town, cost what it would. As 
[70] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

I said, the duke was first in the field ; the prince 
was in no condition to prevent his raising the block- 
ade by force ; so he drew off his troops, and leaving 
several strong bodies of troops to protect Bersello, 
which the Duke de Vendome threatened, and Borgo 
Fort, where his magazine lay, he drew all the rest of 
his forces together, to make head against us. By 
this time the king of Spain was come into the army, 
and the Duke de Vendome lay with about thirty-five 
thousand men near Luzara, which he had resolved 
to attack, to bring Prince Eugene to a battle. The 
Prince of Vaudemont lay intrenched with twenty 
thousand more at Rivalto, behind Mantua, to cover 
the frontiers of Milan, and there was near twelve 
thousand in Mantua itself ; and Monsieur Pracontal 
lay with ten thousand men just under the cannon 
of one of the forts which guard the causeway which 
leads into the city of Mantua ; so that, had all these 
joined, as they would have done in a few days more, 
the prince must have been put to his shifts, and 
would have had enough to do to have maintained 
himself in Italy ; for he was master of no one place 
in the country that could have held out a formal 
siege of fifteen days 1 open trenches, and he knew all 
this very well ; and therefore it seems, while the Duke 
of Vendome resolved, if possible, to bring him to a 
battle, and to that end made dispositions to attack 
Luzara, we were surprised to find, the 15th of June 
[71] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

1702, the whole imperial army appeared in ba&tdRa> 
and in full march, to attack us. 

As it happened, our army was all marching in 
columns towards them, as we had done for two days 
before ; and I should have told you that, three days 
before, the duke having noticed that General Vis- 
conti, with three imperial regiments of horse 
and one of dragoons, was posted at San-Victoria, 
on the Tessona, he resolved to attack them ; and this 
design was carried so secretly, that while Monsieur 
Visconti, though our army was three leagues another 
way, was passing towards the Modenese, he found 
himself unexpectedly attacked by six thousand horse 
and dragoons of the French army. He defended 
himself very bravely for near an hour ; when, being 
overpowered, and finding he should be forced into 
disorder, he sounded a retreat. But the squadrons 
had not faced about to make their retreat scarce a 
quarter of an hour, when they found themselves 
surrounded with a great body of infantry, who had 
entirely cut off their retreat, except over the bridge 
of Tessona, which being thronged with their bag- 
gage, they could neither get backward or forward ; 
so they thrust and tumbled over one another in 
such a manner that they could preserve no kind 
of order ; but abundance fell into the river and 
were drowned, many were killed, and more taken^ 
prisoners ; so that, in a word, the whole three regi- 
[72] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

ments of horse and one of dragoons were entirely 
defeated. 

This was a great blow to the prince, because they 
were some of the choicest troops of his whole army. 
We took about four hundred prisoners, and all their 
baggage, which was a very considerable booty, and 
about eight hundred horses ; and no doubt these 
troops were very much wanted in the battle that en- 
sued on the 15th, as I have said. Our army being 
in full march, as above, to attack Luzara, a party 
of Germans appeared, being about six hundred 
horse, and in less than an hour more their whole 
army, in order of battle. 

Our army formed immediately, and the duke 
posted the regiments as they came up so much to 
their advantage that Prince Eugene was obliged to 
alter his dispositions, and had this particular incon- 
venience upon his hands, viz., to attack an army 
superior to his own, in all their most advantageous 
posts; whereas, had he thought fit to have waited 
but one day, we should have met him half-way. 
But this was owing to the pride of the German gen- 
erals, and their being so opinionated of the goodness 
of their troops. The royal army was posted with 
the left to the great river Po, on the other side of 
which the Prince of Vaudemont's army lay cannon- 
ading the intrenchments which the imperialists had 
made at Borgo Fort; and hearing that there was 
[78] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

like to be a general battle, he detached twelve bat- 
talions and about a thousand horse, to reinforce the 
royal army ; all which, to our great encouragement, 
had time to join the army, while Prince Eugene was 
making his new dispositions for the attack. And 
yet it was the coming of these troops which caused 
Prince Eugene to resolve to begin the fight, expect- 
ing to have come to an action before they could 
come up. But he was disappointed in the reason of 
fighting, and yet was obliged to fight too, which 
was an error in the prince that it was too late to 
retrieve. 

It was five o'clock in the evening before he could 
bring up his whole line to engage ; and then, after 
having cannonaded us to no great purpose for half- 
an-hour, his right, commanded by the Prince de 
Commercy, attacked our left wing with great fury. 
Our men received them so well and seconded one 
another so punctually that they were repulsed with 
a very great slaughter ; and the Prince de Commercy 
being, unhappily for them, killed in the first onset, 
the regiments, for want of orders, and surprised with 
the fall of so great a man, were pushed into disorder, 
and one whole brigade was entirely broke. 

But their second line, advancing under General 
Herbeville, restored things in the first. The battal- 
ions rallied, and they came boldly on to charge a 
second time, and being seconded with new reinforce- 
[74] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

ments from their main body, our men had their turn, 
and were pushed to a canal which lay on their left 
flank between them and the Po, behind which they 
rallied ; and being supported by new troops, as well 
horse as foot, they fought on both sides with the 
utmost obstinacy, and with such courage and skill 
that it was not possible to judge who should have 
had the better could they have been able to have 
fought it out. 

On the right of the royal army was posted the 
flower of the French cavalry — namely, the gen- 
darmes, the royal carbineers, and the queen's horse- 
guards, with four hundred horse more — and next 
them the infantry, among which were our brigade. 
The horse advanced first to charge, and they carried 
all before them sword in hand, receiving the fire of two 
imperial regiments of cuirassiers without firing a shot, 
and falling in among them, bore them down by the 
strength of their horses, putting them into confu- 
sion, and left so clear a field for us to follow that 
the first line of our infantry stood drawn up upon 
the ground which the enemy at first possessed. 

In this first attack the Marquis de Crequi, who 
commanded the whole right wing, was killed — : a loss 
which fully balanced the death of the Prince de 
Commercy on the side of the Germans. After we 
had thus pushed the enemy's cavalry, as above, their 
troops, being rallied by the dexterity of their generals 
[75] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

and supported by three imperial regiments of foot, 
came on again to the charge with such fury that 
nothing could withstand them. And here two bat- 
talions of our Irish regiments were put into disorder, 
and abundance of our men killed ; and here also I 
had the misfortune to receive a musket-shot, which 
broke my left arm ; and that was not all, for I was 
knocked down by a giant-like German soldier, who, 
when he thought he had killed me, set his foot upon 
me, but was immediately shot dead by one of my 
men, and fell just upon me, which, my arm being 
broken, was a very great mischief to me ; for the 
very weight of the fellow, who was almost as big as 
a horse, was such that I was not able to stir. 

Our men were beaten back after this from the 
place where they stood ; and so I was left in posses- 
sion of the enemy, but was not their prisoner — that 
is to say, was not found till next morning, when a 
party being sent, as usual, with surgeons to look 
after the wounded men among the dead, found me 
almost smothered with the dead Germans and others 
that lay near me. However, to do them justice, 
they used me with humanity, and the surgeons set 
my arm very skilfully and well ; and four or five days 
after, I had liberty to go to Parma upon parole. 

Both the armies continued fighting, especially on 
our left, till it was so dark that it was impossible to 
know who they fired at, or for the generals to see 
[76] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

what they did ; so they abated firing gradually, and, 
as it may be truly said, the night parted them. 

Both sides claimed the victory, and both concealed 
their losses as much as it was possible ; but it is cer- 
tain that never battle was fought with greater bravery 
and obstinacy than this was ; and had there been day- 
light to have fought it out, doubtless there would have 
been many thousand more men killed on both sides. 

All the Germans had to entitle them to the victory 
was, that they made our left retire, as I have said, to 
the canal,* and to the high banks or mounds on the 
edge of the Po ; but they had so much advantage in 
the retreat — they fired from thence among the thick- 
est of the enemy, and could never be forced from 
their posts. 

The best testimony the royal army had of the vic- 
tory, and which was certainly the better of the two, 
was, that, two days after the fight, they attacked 
Guastalia, as it were in view of the German army, and 
forced the garrison to surrender, and to swear not to 
serve again for six months, which, they being fifteen 
hundred men, was a great loss to the Germans ; and 
yet Prince Eugene did not offer to relieve it. And 
after that we took several other posts which the im- 
perialists had possession of, but were obliged to quit 
them upon the approach of the French army, not 
being in a condition to fight another battle that 
year. 

[77] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

My campaign was now at an end, and though I 
came lame off, I came off much better than abun- 
dance of gentlemen ; for in that bloody battle we 
had above four hundred officers killed or wounded, 
whereof three were general officers. 

The campaign held on till December, and the 
Duke de Vendome took Borgo Fort and several 
other places from the Germans, who, in short, lost 
ground every day in Italy. I was a prisoner a great 
while, and there being no cartel settled, Prince 
Eugene ordered the French prisoners to be sent into 
Hungary, which was a cruelty that could not be 
reasonably exercised on them. However, a great 
many, by that banishment, found means to make 
their escape to the Turks, by whom they were kindly 
received, and the French ambassador at Constanti- 
nople took care of them, and shipped them back 
again into Italy at the king's charge. 

But the Duke de Vendome now took so many 
German prisoners that Prince Eugene was tired of 
sending his prisoners to Hungary, and was obliged 
to be at the charge of bringing some of them back 
again whom he had sent thither, and come to agree 
to a general exchange of prisoners. 

I was, as I have said, allowed for a time to go 

to Parma upon my parole, where I continued for the 

recovery of my wound and broken arm forty days, 

and was then obliged to render myself to the com-

THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

manding officer at Ferrara, where Prince Eugene 
coining soon after, I was, with several other prisoners 
of war, sent away into the Milanese, to be kept for 
an exchange of prisoners. 

It was in the city of Trent that I continued about 
eight months. The man in whose house I quartered 
was exceedingly civil to me, and took a great deal of 
care of me, and I lived very easy. Here I contracted 
a kind of familiarity, perfectly undesigned by me, with 
the daughter of the burgher at whose house I had 
lodged, and, I know not by what fatality that was 
upon me, I was prevailed with afterwards to marry her. 
This was a piece of honesty on my side which I must 
acknowledge I never intended to be guilty of ; but 
the girl was too cunning for me, for she found means 
to get some wine into my head more than I used to 
drink, and though I was not so disordered with it 
but that I knew very well what I did, yet in an un- 
usual height of good humour I consented to be 
married. This impolitic piece of honesty put me 
to many inconveniences, for I knew not what to do 
with this clog which I had loaded myself with. I 
could neither stay with her or take her with me, so 
that I was exceedingly perplexed. 

The time came soon after that I was released by 

the cartel, and so was obliged to go to my regiment, 

which then was in quarters in the Milanese, and from 

thence I got leave to go to Paris, upon my promise 

[79] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

to raise some recruits in England for the Irish regi- 
ments, by the help of my correspondence there. 
Having thus leave to go to Paris, I took a passport 
from the enemy's army to go to Trent, and making 
along circuit, I went back thither, and very honestly 
packed up my baggage, wife and all, and brought her 
away through Tyrol into Bavaria, and so through 
Suabia and the Black Forest into Alsatia; from 
thence I came into Lorraine, and so to Paris. 

I had now a secret design to quit the war, for I 
really had had enough of fighting. But it was 
counted so dishonourable a thing to quit while the 
army was in the field that I could not dispense with 
it ; but an intervening accident made that part easy 
to me. The war was now renewed between France 
and England and Holland, just as it was before ; and ' 
the French king, meditating nothing more than how 
to give the English a diversion, fitted out a strong 
squadron of men-of-war and frigates at Dunkirk, on 
board of which he embarked a body of troops of 
about six thousand five hundred men, besides volun- 
teers ; and the new king, as we called him, though 
more generally he was called the Chevalier de St. 
George, was shipped along with them, and all for 
Scotland. 

I pretended a great deal of zeal for this service, 
and that if I might be permitted to sell my company 
in the Irish regiment I was in, and have the cheva- 
[80] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

liers brevet for a colonel, in case of raising troops 
for him in Great Britain after his arrival, I would 
embark volunteer and serve at my own expense. 
The latter gave me a great advantage with the 
chevalier ; for now I was esteemed as a man of con- 
sideration, and one that must have a considerable 
interest in my* own country. So I obtained leave to 
sell my company, and having had a good round sum 
of money remitted me from London, by the way of 
Holland, I prepared a very handsome equipage, and 
away 1 went to Dunkirk to embark. 

I was very well received by the chevalier ; and as 
he had an account that I was an officer in the Irish 
brigade, and had served in Italy, and consequently 
was an old soldier, all this added to the character 
which I had before, and made me have a great deal 
of honour paid me, though at the same time I had 
no particular attachment to his person or to his 
cause. Nor indeed did I much consider the cause 
of one side or other. If I had, I should hardly have 
risked, not my life only, but effects too, which were 
all, as I might say, from that moment forfeited to 
the English government, and were too evidently in 
their power to confiscate at their pleasure. 

However, having just received a remittance from 

London of ,£300 sterling, and sold my company in 

the Irish' regiment for very near as much, I was not 

only insensibly drawn in, but was perfectly volunteer

in that dull cause, and away I went with them at all 
hazards. It belongs very little to my history to 
give an account of that fruitless expedition, only to 
tell you that, being so closely and effectually chased 
by the English fleet, which was superior in force to 
the French, I may say that, in escaping them, I es- 
caped being hanged. 

It was the good fortune of the French that they 
overshot the port they aimed at, and intending for 
the Frith of Forth, or, as it is called, the Frith of 
Edinburgh, the first land they made was as far north 
as a place called Montrose, where it was not their 
business to land, and so they were obliged to come 
back to the frith, and were gotten to the entrance 
of it, and came to an anchor for the tide. But this 
delay or hindrance gave time to the English, under 
Sir George Byng, to come to the frith, and they 
came to an anchor, just as we did, only waiting to go 
up the frith with the flood. 

Had we not overshot the port, as above, all our 
squadron had been destroyed in two days, and all we 
could have done had been to have gotten into the 
pier or haven at Leith with the smaller frigates, and 
have landed the troops and ammunition ; but we 
must have set fire to the men-of-war, for the English 
squadron was not above twenty-four hours behind 
us, or thereabout 

Upon this surprise, the French admiral set sail 
[82] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

from the north point of the frith where we lay, and 
crowding away to the north, got the start of the 
English fleet, and made their escape, with the loss of 
one ship only, which, being behind the rest, could 
not get away. 

When we were satisfied the English left chasing 
us, which was not till the third night, when we 
altered our course and lost sight of them, we stood 
over to the coast of Norway, and keeping that shore 
on board all the way to the mouth of the Baltic, we 
came to an anchor again, and sent two scouts abroad 
to learn news, to see if the sea was clear ; and being 
satisfied that the enemy did not chase us, we kept 
on with an easier sail, and came all back again to 
Dunkirk ; and glad I was to set my foot on shore 
again ; for all the while we were thus flying for our 
lives I was under the greatest terror imaginable, and 
nothing but halters and gibbets run in my head, 
concluding that, if I had been taken, I should cer- 
tainly have been hanged. 

But the care was now over. I took my leave of 
the chevalier, and of the army, and made haste to 
Paris. I came so unexpectedly to Paris, and to my 
own lodgings, that it was my misfortune to make a 
discovery relating to my wife which was not at all to 
my satisfaction ; for I found her ladyship had kept 
some company that I had reason to believe were not 
such as an honest woman ought to have conversed 
[88] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

with, and as I knew her temper by what I had found 
of her myself, I grew very jealous and uneasy about 
her. I must own it touched me very nearly, for I 
began to have an extraordinary value for her, and 
her behaviour was very taking, especially after I had 
brought her into France; but having a vein of 
levity, it was impossible to prevent her running 
into such things in a town so full of what they call 
gallantry as Paris. 

It vexed me also to think that it should be my 
fate to be a cuckold both abroad and at home, and 
sometimes I would be in such a rage about it that I 
had no government of myself when I thought of it. 
Whole days, and I may say sometimes whole nights, 
I spent musing and considering what I should do to 
her, and especially what I should do to the villain, 
whoever he was, that had thus abused and sup- 
planted me. Here indeed I committed murder more 
than once, or indeed than a hundred times, in my 
imagination ; and, as the devil is certainly an ap- 
parent prompter to wickedness, if he is not the first 
mover of it in our minds, he teased me night and 
day with proposals to kill my wife. 

This horrid project he carried up so high, by rais- 
ing tierce thoughts and fomenting the blood upon 
my contemplation of the word cuckold, that, in 
short, I left debating whether I should murder her 
or no, as a thing out of the question, and deter- 
[84] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

mined ; and my thoughts were then taken up only 
with the management how I should kill her, and 
how to make my escape after I had done it. 

All this while I had no sufficient evidence of her 
guilt, neither had I so much as charged her with it 
or let her know I suspected her, otherwise than as 
she might perceive it in my conduct, and in the 
change of my behaviour to her, which was such that 
she could not but perceive that something troubled 
me. Yet she took no notice of it to me, but re- 
ceived me very well, and showed herself to be glad 
of my return. Nor did I find she had been extrava- 
gant in her expenses while I was abroad. But 
jealousy, as the wise man says, is the wrath of a 
man ; her being so good a hussy at what money I 
had left her gave my distempered fancy an opinion 
that she had been maintained by other people, and 
so had had no occasion to spend. 

I must confess she had a difficult point here upon 
her, though she had been really honest ; for, as my 
head was prepossessed of her dishonesty, if she had 
been lavish I should have said she had spent it upon 
her gentlemen ; and as she had been frugal, I said 
she had been maintained by them. Thus, I say, my 
head was distempered ; I believed myself abused, 
and nothing could put it out of my thoughts night 
or day. 

All this while it was not visibly broken out 
[86] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

between us ; but I was so fully possessed with the 
belief of it that I seemed to want no evidence, and I 
looked with an evil eye upon everybody that came 
near her or that she conversed with. There was an 
officer of the Guards du Corps that lodged in the 
same house with us, a very honest gentleman and a 
man of quality. I happened to be in a little draw- 
ing-room adjoining to a parlour where my wife sat 
at that time, and this gentleman came into the par- 
lour, which, as he was one of the family, he might 
have done without offence ; but he, not knowing 
that I was in the drawing-room, sat down and talked 
with my wife. I heard every word they said, for 
the door between us was open ; nor could I say that 
there passed anything between them but cursory dis- 
course. They talked of casual things, of a young 
lady, a burgher's daughter of nineteen, that had 
been married the week before to an advocate in the 
Parliament of Paris, vastly rich, and about sixty- 
three ; and of another, a widow lady of fortune in 
Paris, that had married her deceased husband's valet 
de chambre ; and of such casual matters, that I could 
find no fault with her now at all. 

But it filled my head with jealous thoughts and 
fired my temper. Now I fancied he used too much 
freedom with her, then that she used too much free- 
dom to him, and once or twice I was upon the point 
of breaking in upon them and affronting them both, 
[86] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

but I restrained myself. At length he talked some- 
thing merrily of the lady throwing away her maiden- 
head, as I understood it, upon an old man ; but still 
it was nothing indecent. But I, who was all on fire 
already, could bear it no longer, but started up and 
came into the room, and catching at my wife's words, 
"Say you so, madam? 1 ' said I. "Was he too old 
for her?" and giving the officer a look that I fancy 
was something akin to the face on the sign called 
the Bull and Mouth, within Aldersgate, I went out 
into the street. 

The marquis — so he was styled — a man of 
honour and of spirit too, took it as I meant it, and 
followed me in a moment and " hemmed " after me 
in the street ; upon which I stopped, and he came 
up to me. " Sir," said he, " our circumstances are 
very unhappy in France, that we cannot do our- 
selves justice here without the most severe treatment 
in the world. But, come on it what will, you must 
explain yourself to me on the subject of your be- 
haviour just now." 

I was a little cooled as to the point of my con- 
duct to him in the very few moments that had 
passed, and was very sensible that I was wrong to 
him; and I said, therefore, to him, very frankly, 
" Sir, you are a gentleman whom I know very well, 
and I have a very great respect for you ; but I had 
been disturbed a little about the conduct of my wife, 
[87] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

and were it your own case, what would you have 
done less ? " 

ft Iam sorry for any dislike between you and your 
wife, 1 ' says he ; " but what is that to me ? Can you 
charge me with any indecency to her, except my 
talking so and so?" (at which he repeated the 
words) ; u and as I knew you were in the next room 
and heard every word, and that all the doors were 
open, I thought no man could have taken amiss so 
innocent an expression." 

" I could no otherwise take it amiss," said I, " than 
as I thought it implied a farther familiarity, and 
that you cannot expect should be borne by any man 
of honour. However, sir," said I, " I spoke only to 
my wife. I said nothing to you, but gave you my 
hat as I passed you." 

" Yes," said he, " and a look as full of rage as the 
devil. Are there no words in such looks ? " 

" I can say nothing to that," said I, " for I cannot 
see my own countenance ; but my rage, as you call it, 
was at my wife, not at you." 

u But hark you, sir," said he, growing warm as I 
grew calm, " your anger at your wife was for her dis- 
course with me, and I think that concerns me too, 
and I ought to resent it" 

" I think not, sir," said I ; " nor, had I found you 
in bed with my wife, would I have quarrelled with 
you ; for if my wife will let you lie with her, it is she 
[88] 



THE LIFE OP COLONEL JACQUE 

is the offender. What have I to do with you ? You 
could not lie with her if she was not willing ; and if 
she is willing to be a whore, I ought to punish her ; 
but I should have no quarrel with you. I will lie 
with your wife if I can, and then I am even with 
you." 

I spoke this all in good humour and in order to 
pacify him, but it would not do ; but he would have 
me give him satisfaction, as he called it. I told him 
I was a stranger in the country, and perhaps should 
find little mercy in their course of justice ; that it 
was not my business to fight any man in his vindi- 
cating his keeping company with my wife, for that 
the injury was mine, in having a bad woman to deal 
with ; that there was no reason in the thing, that 
after any man should have found the way into my 
bed, I, who am injured, should go and stake my life 
upon an equal hazard against the man who has 
abused me. 

Nothing would prevail with this person to be 
quiet for all this ; but I had affronted him, and no 
satisfaction could be made him but that at the point 
of the sword ; so we agreed to go away together to 
Lisle, in Flanders. I was now soldier enough not to 
be afraid to look a man in the face, and as the rage 
at my wife inspired me with courage, so he let fall a 
word that fired and provoked me beyond all patience ; 
for, speaking of the distrust I had of my wife, he 
[89] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

said, unless I had good information I ought not to 
suspect my wife. I told him, if I had good informa- 
tion, I should be past suspicion. He replied, if he 
was the happy man, that had so much of her favour, 
he would take care then to put me past the suspicion. 
I gave him as rough an answer as he could desire, 
and he returned in French, a Nous verrons A Lisle ; ** 
that is to say, " We will talk further of it at Lisle." 

I told him I did not see the benefit either to him 
or me of going so far as Lisle to decide this quarrel, 
since now I perceived he was the man I wanted; 
that we might decide this quarrel au champ, upon 
the spot, and whoever had the fortune to fall the 
other might make his escape to Lisle as well after- 
wards as before. 

Thus we walked on talking very ill-naturedly on 
both sides, and yet very mannerly, till we came clear 
of the suburbs of Paris, on the* way to Charenton ; 
when, seeing the way clear, I told him under those 
trees was a very fit place for us, pointing to a row of 

trees adjoining to Monsieur 's garden-wall. So 

we went thither, and fell to work immediately. 
After some fencing he made a home-thrust at me, 
and run me into my arm, a long slanting wound, 
but at the same time received my point into his 
body, and soon after fell. He spoke some words 
before he dropped ; first he told me I had killed him ; 
then he said he had indeed wronged me, and as he 
[90] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

knew it, he ought not to have fought me. He 
desired I would make my escape immediately, which 
I did into the city, but no farther, nobody, as I 
thought, having seen us together. In the afternoon, 
about six hours after the action, messengers brought 
news, one on the heels of another, that the marquis 
was mortally wounded, and carried into a house at 
Charenton. That account, saying he was not dead, 
surprised me a little, not doubting but that, con- 
cluding I had made my escape, he would own who 
it was. However, I discovered nothing of my con- 
cern, but, going up into my chamber, I took out of 
a cabinet there what money I had, which indeed 
was so much as I thought would be sufficient for my 
expenses. But having an accepted bill for two 
thousand livres, I walked sedately to a merchant 
who knew me, and got fifty pistoles of him upon my 
bill, letting him know my business called me to 
England, and I would take the rest of him when he 
had received it. 

Having furnished myself thus, I provided me a horse 
for my servant, for I had one very good one of my 
own, and once more ventured home to my lodging, 
where I heard again that the marquis was not dead. 
My wife all this while covered her concern for the mar- 
quis so well that she gave me no room to make any 
remark upon her ; but she saw evidently the marks 
of rage and deep resentment in my behaviour after 
[91] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

some little stay, and perceiving me making prepar- 
ation for a journey, she said to me, " Are you going 
out of town ? " " Yes, madam," says I, " that you 
may have room to mourn for your friend the mar- 
quis ; " at which she started, and showed she was 
indeed in a most terrible fright, and making a thou- 
sand crosses about herself, with a great many callings 
upon the Blessed Virgin and her country saints, 
she burst out at last, "Is it possible? Are you 
the man that has killed the marquis? Then you 
are undone, and I too." 

" You may, madam, be a loser by the marquis be- 
ing killed ; but 1 11 take care to be as little a loser 
by you as I can. TTis enough; the marquis has 
honestly confessed your guilt, and I have done with 
you." She would have thrown herself into my arms, 
protesting her innocence, and told me she would fly 
with me, and would convince me of her fidelity by 
such testimonies as I could not but be satisfied with, 
but I thrust her violently from me. " Alkz, tnfame ! " 
said I. " Go, infamous creature, and take from me 
the necessity I should be under, if I stayed, of send- 
ing you to keep company with your dear friend the 
marquis." I thrust her away with such force that 
she fell backward upon the floor, and cried out most 
terribly, and indeed she had reason, for she was very 
much hurt. 

It grieved me indeed to have thrust her away with 
[92] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

such force, but you must consider me now in the cir- 
cumstances of a man enraged, and, as it were, out of 
himself, furious and mad. However, I took her up 
from the floor and laid her on the bed, and calling 
up her maid, bid her go and take care of her mis- 
tress ; and, going soon after out of doors, I took horse 
and made the best of my way, not towards Calais or 
Dunkirk, or towards Flanders, whither it might be 
suggested I was fled, and whither they did pursue 
me the same evening, but I took the direct road for 
Lorraine, and riding all night and very hard, I passed 
the Maine the next day at night, at Chalons, and 
came safe into the Duke of Lorraine's dominions the 
third day, where I rested one day only to consider 
what course to take ; for it was still a most difficult 
thing to pass any way, but that I should either be 
in the king of France's dominions or be taken by the 
French allies as a subject of France. But getting 
good advice from a priest at Bar le Due, who, though 
I did not tell him the particulars of my case, yet 
guessed how it was, it being, as he said, very usual 
for gentlemen in my circumstances to fly that way ; 
— upon this supposition, this kind padre got me a 
church pass ; that is to say, he made me a purveyor 
for the abbey of , and, as such, got me a pass- 
port to go to Deux Ponts, which belonged to the 
king of Sweden. Having such authority there, and 
the priest's recommendation to an ecclesiastic in 
[98] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

the place, I got passports from thence in the king of 
Sweden's name to Cologne, and then I was thoroughly 
safe. So, making my way to the Netherlands without 
any difficulty, I came to the Hague, and from 
thence, though very privately and by several names, 
I came to England. And thus I got clear of my 
Italian wife — whore I should have called her ; for, 
after I had made her so myself, how should I expect 
any other of her ? 

Being arrived at London, I wrote to my friend at 
Paris, but dated my letters from the Hague, where I 
ordered him to direct his answers. The chief busi- 
ness of my writing was to know if my bill was paid 
him, to. inquire if any pursuit was made after me, 
and what other news he had about me or my 
wife, and particularly how it had fared with the 
marquis. 

I received an answer in a few days, importing that 
he had received the money on my bill, which he was 
ready to pay as I should direct ; that the marquis 
was not dead ; " but," said he, " you have killed him 
another way, for he has lost his commission in the 
Guards, which was worth to him twenty thousand 
livres, and he is yet a close prisoner in the Bastile ;" 
that pursuit was ordered after me upon suspicion ; 
that they had followed me to Amiens, on the road to 
Dunkirk, and to Chastean de Cambresis, on the way 
to Flanders, but missing me that way, had given it 
[94] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

over ; that the marquis had been too well instructed 
to own that he had fought with me, but said that he 
was assaulted on the road, and unless I could be taken, 
he would tal^e his trial and come off for want of proof; 
that my flying was a circumstance indeed that moved 
strongly against him, because it was known that we 
had had some words that day, and were seen to walk 
together, but that, nothing being proved on either 
side, he would come off with the loss of his com- 
mission, which, however, being very rich, he could 
bear well enough. 

As to my wife, he wrote me word she was incon- 
solable, and had cried herself to death almost ; but 
he added (very ill-natured indeed), whether it<was for 
me or for the marquis, that he could not determine. 
He likewise told me she was in very bad circum- 
stances and very low, so that, if I did not take some 
care of her, she would come to be in very great 
distress. 

The latter part of this story moved me indeed, 
for I thought, however it was, I ought not to let her 
starve ; and, besides, poverty was a temptation which 
a woman could not easily withstand, and I ought 
not to be the instrument to drive her to a horrid 
necessity of crime, if I could prevent it. 

Upon this I wrote to him again to go to her, and 
talk with her, and learn as much as he could of her 
particular circumstances ; and that, if he found she 
[96] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

was really in want, and, particularly, that she did 
not live a scandalous life, he should give her twenty 
pistoles, and tell her, if she would engage to live re- 
tired and honestly, she should have so muqh annually, 
which was enough to subsist her. 

She took the first twenty pistoles, but bade him 
tell me that I had wronged her and unjustly charged 
her, and I ought to do her justice ; and I had ruined 
her by exposing her in such a manner as I had, hav- 
ing no proof of my charge or ground for any sus- 
picion ; that, as to twenty pistoles a year, it was a 
mean allowance to a wife that had travelled over the 
world, as she had done with me, and the like ; and 
so expostulated with him to obtain forty pistoles a 
year of me, which I consented to. But she never 
gave me the trouble of paying above one year ; for 
after that the marquis was so fond of her again that 
he took her away to himself, and, as my friend wrote 
me word, had settled four hundred crowns a year on 
her, and I never heard any more of her. 

I was now in London, but was obliged to be very 
retired and change my name, letting nobody in the 
nation know who I was, except my merchant by whom 
I corresponded with my people in Virginia ; and par- 
ticularly with my tutor, who was now become the 
head manager of my affairs, and was in very good 
circumstances himself also by my means. But he de- 
served all I did or could do for him, for he was a 
[96] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

most faithful friend as well as servant, as ever man 
had, in that country at least. 

I was not the easiest man alive, in the retired, 
solitary manner I now lived in ; and I experienced 
the truth of the text, that " it is not good for man 
to be alone," for I was extremely melancholy and 
heavy, and indeed knew not what to do with myself, 
particularly because I was under some restraint, that 
I was too afraid to go abroad. At last I resolved to 
go quite away, and go to Virginia again, and there 
live retired as I could. 

But when I came to consider that part more 
narrowly, I could not prevail with myself to live a 
private life. I had got a wandering kind of taste, 
and knowledge of things begat a desire of increasing 
it, and an exceeding delight I had in it, though I 
had nothing to do in the armies or in war, and did 
not design ever to meddle with it again. Yet I 
could not live in the world and not inquire what was 
doing in it ; nor could I think of living in Virginia, 
where I was to hear my news twice a year, and read 
the public accounts of what was just then upon the 
stocks, as the history of things past. 

This was my notion: I was now in my native 
country, where my circumstances were easy, and 
though I had ill-luck abroad, for I brought little 
money home with me, yet, by a little good manage- 
ment, I might soon have money by me. I had no-

THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

body to keep but myself, and my plantations in 
Virginia generally returned me from £4/00 to i?600 
a year, one year above <£700, and to go thither, I 
concluded, was to be buried alive ; so I put off all 
thoughts of it, and resolved to settle somewhere in 
England where I might know everybody and nobody 
know me. I was not long in concluding where to 
pitch, for as I spoke the French tongue perfectly 
well, having been so many years among them, it was 
easy for me to pass for a Frenchman. So I went to 
Canterbury, called myself an Englishman among the 
French, and a Frenchman among the English ; and 
on that score was the more perfectly concealed, going 
by the name of Monsieur Charnot with the French, 
and was called Mr. Charnock among the English. 

Here indeed I lived perfectly incog. I made no 
particular acquaintance so as to be intimate, and yet 
I knew everybody, and everybody knew me. I dis- 
coursed in common, talked French with the Wal- 
loons, and English with the English; and lived 
retired and sober, and was well enough received by 
all sorts ; but as I meddled with nobody's business, 
so nobody meddled with mine; I thought I lived 
pretty well. 

But I was not fully satisfied. A settled family 

life was the thing I loved ; had made two pushes at 

it, as you have heard, but with ill-success ; yet the 

miscarriage of what was past did not discourage me 

[98] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

at all, but I resolved to marry. I looked out for a 
woman as suitable as I could, but always found some- 
thing or other to shock my fancy, except once a gen- 
tleman's daughter of good fashion ; but I met with 
so many repulses of one kind or another that I was 
forced to give it over ; and indeed, though I might 
be said to be a lover in this suit, and had managed 
myself so well with the young lady that I had no 
difficulty left but what would soon have been ad- 
justed, yet her father was so difficult, made so many 
objections, was to-day not pleased one way, to- 
morrow another, that he would stand by nothing 
that he himself had proposed, nor could he be ever 
brought to be of the same mind two days together ; 
so that we at last put an end to the pretensions, for 
she would not marry without her father's consent, 
and I would not steal her, and so that affair ended. 

I cannot say but I was a little vexed at the dis- 
appointment of this, so I left the city of Canterbury 
and went to London in the stage-coach. Here I 
had an odd scene presented as ever happened of its 
kind. 

There was in the stage-coach a young woman and 
her maid. She was sitting in a very melancholy 
posture, for she was in the coach before me, and 
sighed most dreadfully all the way, and whenever 
her maid spoke to her she burst out into tears. I 
was not long in the coach with her but, seeing she 
[99] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

made such a dismal figure, I offered to comfort her 
a little, and inquired into the occasion of her afflic- 
tion. But she would not speak a word ; but her 
maid, with a force of crying too, said her master was 
dead, at which word the lady burst out again into 
a passion of crying, and between mistress and maid 
this was all I could get for the morning part of that 
day. When we came to dine, I offered the lady, 
that seeing, I supposed, she would not dine with the 
company, if she would please to dine with me, I 
would dine in a separate room ; for the rest of the 
company were foreigners. Her maid thanked me 
in her mistress's name, but her mistress could eat 
nothing, and desired to be private. 

Here, however, I had some discourse with the 
maid, from whom I learned that the lady was wife 
to a captain of a ship, who was outward bound to 
somewhere in the Straits — I think it was to Zante 
and Venice; that, being gone no farther than the 
Downs, he was taken sick, and after about ten days' 
illness had died at Deal ; that his wife, hearing of 
his sickness, had gone to Deal to see him, and had 
come but just time enough to see him die ; had stayed 
there to bury him, and was now coming to London 
in a sad, disconsolate condition indeed. 

I heartily pitied the young gentlewoman indeed, 
and said some things to her in the coach to let her 
know I did so, which she gave no answer to, but in 
[100] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

civility now and then made a bow, but never gave 
me the least opportunity to see her face, or so much 
as to know whether she had a face or no, much less 
to guess what form of a face it was. It was winter- 
time, and the coach put up at Rochester, not going 
through in a day, as was usual in summer ; and a 
little before we came to Rochester I told the lady 
I understood she had ate nothing to-day, that such 
a course would but make her sick, and, doing her 
harm, could do her deceased husband no good ; and 
therefore I entreated her that, as I was a stranger, 
and only offered a civility to her in order to abate 
her severely afflicting herself, she would yield so far 
to matters of ceremony as let us sup together as 
passengers; for, as to the strangers, they did not 
seem to understand the custom or to desire it. 

She bowed, but gave no answer ; only, after press- 
ing her by arguments, which she could not deny was 
very civil and kind, she returned, she gave me thanks, 
but she could not eat. "Well, madam,*" said I, 
"do but sit down; though you think you cannot 
eat, perhaps you may eat a bit. Indeed you must 
eat, or you will destroy yourself at this rate of living, 
and upon the road too ; in a word, you will be sick 
indeed." I argued with her. The maid put in, 
and said, " Do, madam ; pray try to divert yourself 
a little.*" I pressed her again, and she bowed to me 
very respectfully, but still said, ** No," and she could 
[101] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

not eat The maid continued to importune her, and 
said, " Dear madam, do. The gentlepian is a civil 
gentleman; pray, madam, do;" and then, turning 
to me, said, " My mistress will, sir, I hope," and 
seemed pleased, and indeed was so. 

However, I went on to persuade her ; and, taking 
no notice of what her maid said, that I was a civil 
gentleman, I told her, ** I am a stranger to you, 
madam ; but if I thought you were shy of me on any 
account, as to civility, I will send my supper up to 
you in your own chamber, and stay below myself." 
She bowed then to me twice, and looked up, which 
was the first time, and said she had no suspicion of 
that kind ; that my offer was so civil that she was as 
much ashamed to refuse it as she should be ashamed 
to accept it, if she was where she was known ; that 
she thought I was not quite a stranger to her, for she 
had seen me before ; that she would accept my offer 
so far as to sit at table, because I desired it ; but she 
could not promise me to eat, and that she hoped I 
would take the other as a constraint upon her, in 
return to so much kindness. 

She startled me when she said she had seen me 
before ; for I had not the least knowledge of her, 
nor did I remember so much as to have heard of her 
name ; for I had asked her name of her maid ; and 
indeed it made me almost repent my compliment, 
for it was many ways essential to me not to be 
[102] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

known. However, I could not go back ; and, be- 
sides, if I was known, it was essentially necessary to 
me to know who it was that knew me, and by what 
circumstances ; so I went on with my compliment. 

We came to the inn but just before it was dark. 
I offered to hand my widow out of the coach, and 
she could not decline it ; but though her hoods were 
not then much over her face, yet, being dark, I could 
see little of her then. I waited on her then into the 
stairfoot, and led her up the inn-stairs to a dining- 
room which the master of the house offered to show 
us, as if for the whole company ; but she declined 
going in there, and said she desired rather to go 
directly to her chamber, and turning to her maid, 
bade her speak to the innkeeper to show her to her 
lodging-room. So I waited on her to the door, and 
took my leave, telling her I would expect her at 
supper.* 

In order to treat her moderately well, and not 
extravagantly, for I had no thoughts of anything 
farther than civility, which was the effect of mere 
compassion for the unhappiness of the most truly 
disconsolate woman that I ever met with ; I say, in 
order to treat her handsomely, but not extravagantly, 
I provided what the house afforded, which was a 
couple of partridges and a very good dish of stewed 
oysters. They brought us up afterwards a neat's 
tongue and a ham that was almost cut quite down, 
[103] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

but we ate none of it ; for the other was fully enough 
for us both, and the maid made her supper off the 
oysters we had left, which were enough. 

I mention this because it should appear I did not 
treat her as a person I was making any court to, for 
I had nothing of that in my thoughts ; but merely 
in pity to the poor woman, who I saw in a circum- 
stance that was indeed very unhappy. 

When I gave her maid notice that supper was 
ready, she fetched her mistress, taming in before her 
with a candle in her hand, and then it was that I 
saw her face, and being in her dishabille, she had no 
hood over her eyes or black upon her head, when I 
was truly surprised to see one of the most beautiful 
faces upon earth. I saluted her, and led her to the 
fireside, the table, though spread, being too far from 
the fire, the weather being cold. 

She was now something sociable, though very 
grave, and sighed often on account of her circum- 
stances. But she so handsomely governed her grief, 
yet so artfully made it mingle itself with all her dis- 
course, that it added exceedingly to her behaviour, 
which was every way most exquisitely genteel. I 
had a great deal of discourse with her, and upon 
many subjects, and by degrees took her name, that 
is to say, from herself, as I had done before from 
her maid ; also the place where she lived, viz., near 
Ratcliff, or rather Stepney, where I asked her leave 
[104] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

to pay her a visit when she thought fit to admit 
company, which she seemed to intimate would not 
be a great while. 

It is a subject too surfeiting to entertain people 
with the beauty of a person they will never see. 
Let it suffice to tell them she was the most beautiful 
creature of her sex that I ever saw before or since ; 
and it cannot be wondered if I was charmed with 
her the very first moment I saw her face. Her be- 
haviour was likewise a beauty in itself, and was so 
extraordinary that I cannot say I can describe it. 

The next day she was much more free than she was 
the first night, and I had so much conversation as to 
enter into particulars of things on both sides ; also 
she gave me leave to come and see her house, which, 
however, I did not do under a fortnight or there- 
abouts, because I did not know how far she would 
dispense with the ceremony which it was necessary 
to keep up at the beginning of the mourning. 

However, I came as a man that had business with her, 
relating to the ship her husband was dead out of, and 
the first time I came was admitted ; and, in short, the 
first time I came I made love to her. She received that 
proposal with disdain. I cannot indeed say she treated 
me with any disrespect, but she said she abhorred the 
offer, and would hear no more of it. How I came to 
make such a proposal to her I scarce knew then, though 
it was very much my intention from the first. 
[105] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

In the meantime I inquired into her circumstances 
and her character, and heard nothing but what was 
very agreeable of them both ; and, above all, I found 
she had the report of the best-humoured lady and 
the best-bred of all that part of the town ; and now 
I thought I had found what I had so often wished 
for to make me happy and had twice miscarried in, 
and resolved not to miss her, if it was possible to 
obtain her. 

It came indeed a little into my thoughts that I 
.was a married man, and had a second wife alive, who, 
though she was false to me and a whore, yet I was 
not legally divorced from her, and that she was my 
wife for all that. But I soon got over that part ; 
for, first, as she was a whore, and the marquis had 
confessed it to me, I was divorced in law, and I had 
a power to put her away. But having had the mis- 
fortune of fighting a duel, and being obliged to quit 
the country, I could not claim the legal process 
which was my right, and therefore might conclude 
myself as much divorced as if it had been actually 
done, and so that scruple vanished. 

I suffered now two months to run without press- 
ing my widow any more, only I kept a strict watch 
to find if any one else pretended to her. At the 
end of two months I visited her again, when I found 
she received me with more freedom, and we had no 
more sighs and sobs about the last husband; and 
[106] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

though she would not let me press my former pro- 
posal so far as I thought I might have done, yet I 
found I had leave to come again, and it was the 
article of decency which she stood upon as much as 
anything ; that I was not disagreeable to her, and 
that my using her so handsomely upon the road had 
given me a great advantage in her favour. 

I went on gradually with her, and gave her leave 
to stand off for two months more. But then I told 
her the matter of decency, which was but a cere- 
mony, was not to stand in competition with the 
matter of affection ; and, in short, I could not bear 
any longer delay, but that, if she thought fit, we 
might marry privately ; and, to cut the story short, 
as I did my courtship, in about five months I got 
her in the mind, and we were privately married, and 
that with so very exact a concealment that her maid, 
that was so instrumental in it, yet had no knowledge 
of it for near a month more. 

I was now, not only in my imagination, but in 
reality, the most happy creature in the world, as I 
was so infinitely satisfied with my wife, who was 
indeed the best-humoured woman in the world, a 
most accomplished, beautiful creature indeed, per- 
fectly well-bred, and had not one ill quality about 
her ; and this happiness continued without the least 
interruption for about six years. 

But I, that was to be the most unhappy fellow 
[107] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

alive in the article of matrimony, had at last a 
disappointment of the worst sort even here. I had 
three fine children by her, and in her time of lying-in 
with the last she got some cold, that she did not in 
a long time get off; and, in short, she grew very 
sickly. In being so continually ill and out of order, 
she very unhappily got a habit of drinking cordials 
and hot liquors. Drink, like the devil, when it gets 
hold of any one, though but a little, it goes on by 
little and little to their destruction. So in my wife, 
her stomach being weak and faint, she first took this 
cordial, then that, till, in short, she could not live 
without them, and from a drop to a sup, from a 
sup to a dram, from a dram to a glass, and so on to 
two, till at last she took, in short, to what we call 
drinking. 

As I likened drink to the devil, in its gradual 
possession of the habits and person, so it is yet more 
like the devil in its encroachment on us, where it 
gets hold of our senses. In short, my beautiful, 
good-humoured, modest, well-bred wife grew a beast, 
a slave to strong liquor, and would be drunk at her 
own table — nay, in her own closet by herself, till, 
instead of a well-made, fine shape, she was as fat as 
a hostess; her fine face, bloated and blotched, had not 
so much as the ruins of the most beautiful person alive 
— nothing remained but a good eye; that indeed she 
held to the last. In short, she lost her beauty, her 
[108] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

shape, her manners, and at last her virtue ; and, 
giving herself up to drinking, killed herself in about 
a year and a half after she first began that cursed 
trade, in which time she twice was exposed in the 
most scandalous manner with a captain of a ship, 
who, like a villain, took the advantage of her being 
in drink and not knowing what she did. But it 
had this unhappy effect, that instead of her being 
ashamed and repenting of it when she came to her- 
self, it hardened her in the crime, and she grew a? 
void of modesty at last as of sobriety. 

Oh, the power of intemperance ! and how it en- 
croaches on the best dispositions in the world ; how 
it comes upon us gradually and insensibly; and what 
dismal effects it works upon our morals, changing 
the most virtuous, regular, well-instructed, and well- 
inclined tempers into worse than brutal ! That was 
a good story, whether real or invented, of the devil 
tempting a young man to murder his father. No, 
he said; that was unnatural. "Why, then,'" says 
the devil, " go and lie with your mother.*" " No," 
says he; " that is abominable." " Well, then," says 
the devil, " if you will do nothing else to oblige me, 
go and get drunk." " Ay, ay," says the fellow, " I 
will do that." So he went and made himself drunk 
as a swine, and when he was drunk, he murdered his 
father and lay with his mother. 

Never was a woman more virtuous, modest, chaste, 
[109] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

sober ; she never so much as desired to drink any- 
thing strong ; it was with the greatest entreaty that 
I could prevail with her to drink a glass or two of 
wine, and rarely, if ever, above one or two at a time ; 
even in company she had no inclination to it Not 
an immodest word ever came out of her mouth, nor 
would she suffer it in any one else in her hearing 
without resentment and abhorrence. But upon that 
weakness and illness after her last lying-in, as above, 
the nurse pressed her, whenever she found herself 
faint and a sinking of her spirits, to take this cordial 
and that dram, to keep up her spirits, till it became 
necessary even to keep her alive, and gradually 
increased to a habit, so that it was no longer her 
physic but her food. Her appetite sunk and went 
quite away, and she ate little or nothing, but came at 
last to such a dreadful height that, as I have said, she 
would be drunk in her own dressing-room by eleven 
o'clock in the morning, and, in short, at last was 
never sober. 

In this life of hellish excess, as I have said, she 
lost all that was before so valuable in her, and a 
villain, if it be proper to call a man who was really 
a gentleman by such a name, who was an intimate 
acquaintance, coming to pretend a visit to her, made 
her and her maid so drunk together that he lay with 
them both; with the mistress, the maid being in 
the room, and with the maid, the mistress being in 
[110] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

the room ; after which he, it seems, took the like 
liberty with them both as often as he thought fit, 
till the wench, being with child, discovered it for 
herself, and for her mistress too. Let any one 
judge what was my case now. I, that for six years 
thought myself the happiest man alive, was now 
the most miserable, distracted creature. As to my 
wife, I loved her so well, and was so sensible of the 
disaster of her drinking being the occasion of it all, 
that I could not resent it to such a degree as I had 
done in her predecessor ; but I pitied her heartily. 
However, I put away all her servants, and almost 
locked her up ; that is to say, I set new people over 
her, who would not suffer any one to come near her 
without my knowledge. 

But what to do with the villain that had thus 
abused both her and me, that was the question that 
remained. To fight him upon equal terms, I thought, 
was a little hard ; that after a man had treated me 
as he had done, he deserved no fair play for his life. 
So I resolved to wait for him in Stepney fields, and 
which way he often came home pretty late, and 
pistol him in the dark, and, if possible, to let him 
know what I killed him for before I did it But 
when I came to consider of this, it shocked my tem- 
per too as well as principle, and I could not be a 
murderer, whatever else I could be, or whatever I 
was provoked to be. 

[in] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

However, I resolved, on the other hand, that I 
would severely correct him for what he had done, 
and it was not long before I had an opportunity ; for, 
hearing one morning that he was walking across the 
fields from Stepney to Shadwell, which way I knew 
he often went, I waited for his coming home again, 
and fairly met him. 

I had not many words with him, but told him I 
had long looked for him ; that he knew the villainy 
he had been guilty of in my family, and he could not 
believe, since he knew also that I was fully in- 
formed of it, but that I must be a great coward, as 
well as a cuckold, or that I would resent it, and that 
it was now a very proper time to call him to an 
account for it ; and therefore bade him, if he durst 
show his face to what he had done, and defend the 
name of a captain of a man-of-war, as they said he 
had been, to draw. 

He seemed surprised at the thing, and began to 
parley, and would lessen the crime of it ; but I told 
him it was not a time to talk that way, since he 
could not deny the fact ; and to lessen the crime was 
to lay it the more upon the woman, who, I was sure, 
if he had not first debauched with wine, he could 
never have brought to the rest ; and, seeing he refused 
to draw, I knocked him down with my cane at one 
blow, and I would not strike him again while he lay 
on the ground, but waited to see him recover a little ; 

[ii*] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

for I saw plainly he was not killed. In a few 
minutes he came to himself again, and then I took 
him fast by one wrist, and caned him as severely as 
I was able, and as long as I could hold it for want 
of breath, but forbore his head, because I was re- 
solved he should feel it. In this condition at last 
he begged for mercy, but I was deaf to all pity a 
great while, till he roared out like a boy soundly 
whipped. Then I took his sword from him and broke 
it before his face, and left him on the ground, giv- 
ing him two or three kicks on the backside, and bade 
him go and take the law of me if he thought fit. 

I had now as much satisfaction as indeed could be 
taken of a coward, and had no more to say to him ; 
but as I knew it would make a great noise about the 
town, I immediately removed my family, and, that I 
might be perfectly concealed, went into the north of 

England, and lived in a little town called , not 

far from Lancaster, where I lived retired, and was 
no more heard of for about two years. My wife, 
though more confined than she used to be, and so 
kept up from the lewd part which, I believe, in the 
intervals of her intemperance, she was truly ashamed 
of and abhorred, yet retained the drinking part, 
which becoming, as I have said, necessary for her 
subsistence, she soon ruined her health, and in about 
a year and a half after my removal into the north 
she died. 

voun.— 8 [US] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

Thus I was once more a free man, and, as one 
would think, should by this time have been fully 
satisfied that matrimony was not appointed to be a 
state of felicity to me. 

I should have mentioned that the villain of a cap- 
tain who I had drubbed, as above, pretended to 
make a great stir about my assaulting him on the 
highway, and that I had fallen upon him with three 
ruffians, with an intent to murder him ; and this 
began to obtain belief among the people in the 
neighbourhood. I sent him word of so much of it 
as I had heard, and told him I hoped it did not 
come from his own mouth ; but if it did, I expected 
he would publicly disown it, he himself declaring he 
knew it to be false, or else I should be forced to act 
the same thing over again, till I had disciplined him 
into better manners ; and that he might be assured 
that if he continued to pretend that I had anybody 
with me when I caned him, I would publish the 
whole story in print, and, besides that, would cane 
him again wherever I met him, and as often as I met 
him, till he thought fit to defend himself with his 
sword like a gentleman. 

He gave me no answer to this letter; and the 
satisfaction I had for that was, that I gave twenty 
or thirty copies of it about among the neighbours, 
which made it as public as if I had printed it (that 
is, as to his acquaintance and mine), and made him 
[114] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

so hissed at and hated that he was obliged to remove 
into some other part of the town — whither I did 
not inquire. 

My wife being now dead, I knew not what course 
to take in the world, and I grew so disconsolate and 
discouraged that I was next door to being distem- 
pered, and sometimes, indeed, I thought myself a 
little touched in my head. But it proved nothing 
but vapours and the vexation of this affair, and in 
about a year's time, or thereabouts, it wore off 
again. 

I had rambled up and down in a most discontented, 
unsettled posture after this, I say, about a year, and 
then I considered I had three innocent children, and 
I could take no care of them, and that I must either 
go away and leave them to the wide world or settle 
here and get somebody to look after them, and that 
better a mother-in-law than no mother ; for to live 
such a wandering life it would not do ; so I resolved 
I would marry as anything offered, though it was 
mean, and the meaner the better. I concluded my 
next wife should be only taken as an upper servant ; 
that is to say, a nurse to my children and house- 
keeper to myself; "and let her be whore or honest 
woman," said I, " as she likes best ; I am resolved I 
will not much concern myself about that;" for I 
was now one desperate, that valued not how things 
went 

[115] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

In this careless, and indeed rash, foolish humour, 
I talked to myself thus : " If I marry an honest 
woman, my children will be taken care of ; if she be 
a slut and abuses me, as I see everybody does, I will 
kidnap her and send her to Virginia, to my planta- 
tions there, and there she shall work hard enough 
and fare hard enough to keep her chaste, 1 11 warrant 
her." 

I knew well enough at first that these were mad, 
hare-brained notions, and I thought no more of being 
serious in them than I thought of being a man in 
the moon ; but I know not how it happened to me, 
I reasoned and talked to myself in this wild manner 
so long that I brought myself to be seriously des- 
perate ; that is, to resolve upon another marriage, 
with all the suppositions of unhappiness that could 
be imagined to fall out. 

And yet even this rash resolution of my senses 
did not come presently to action ; for I was half a 
year after this before I fixed upon anything. At 
last, as he that seeks mischief shall certainly find it, 
so it was with me. There happened to be a young, 
or rather a middle-aged, woman in the next town, 
which was but a half-mile off, who usually was at my 
house and among my children every day when the 
weather was tolerable ; and though she came but 
merely as a neighbour, and to see us, yet she was 
always helpful in directing and ordering things for 
[116] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

them, and mighty handy about them, as well before 
my wife died as after. 

Her father was one that I employed often to go 
to Liverpool, and sometimes to Whitehaven, and do 
business for me ; for having, as it were, settled my- 
self in the northern parts of England, I had ordered 
part of my effects to be shipped,, as occasion of ship- 
ping offered, to either of those two towns, to which, 
the war continuing very sharp, it was safer coming, 
as to privateers, than about through the Channel to 
London. 

I took a mighty fancy at last that this girl would 
answer my end, particularly that I saw she was 
mighty useful among the children ; so, on the other 
hand, the children loved her very well, and I resolved 
to love her too, flattering myself mightily, that as I 
had married two gentlewomen and one citizen, and 
they proved all three whores, I should now find what 
I wanted in an innocent country wench. 

I took up a world of time in considering of this 
matter ; indeed scarce any of my matches were done 
without very mature consideration. The second was 
the worst in that article, but in this I thought of it, 
I believe, four months most seriously before I re- 
solved, and that very prudence spoiled the whole 
thing. However, at last being resolved, I took Mrs. 
Margaret one day as she passed by my parlour-door, 
called her in, and told her I wanted to speak with 
[117] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

her. She came readily in, but blushed mightily when 
I bade her sit down in a chair just by me. 

I used no great ceremony with her, but told her 
that I had observed she had been mighty kind to 
my children, and was very tender to them, and that 
they all loved her, and that, if she and I could agree 
about it, I intended to make her their mother, if she 
was not engaged to somebody else. The girl sat 
still and said never a word till I said those words, 
" if she was not engaged to somebody else ; " when 
she seemed struck. However, I took no notice of it, 
other than this, " Look ye, Moggy," said I (so they 
call them in the country), "if you have promised 
yourself, you must tell me." For we all knew that 
a young fellow, a good clergyman's wicked son, had 
hung about her a great while, two or three years, 
and made love to her, but could never get the girl in 
the mind, it seems, to have him. 

She knew I was not ignorant of it, and therefore, 

after her first surprise was over, she told me Mr. 

had, as I knew, often come after her, but she had 
never promised him anything, and had for several 
years refused him ; her father always telling her that 
he was a wicked fellow, and that he would be her 
ruin if she had him. 

"Well, Moggy, then," says I, " what" dost say to 
me? Art thou free to make me a wife?" She 
blushed and looked down upon the ground, and 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

would not speak a good while ; but when I pressed 
her to tell me, she looked up, and said she supposed 
I was but jesting with her. Well, I got over that, 
and told her I was in very good earnest with her, 
and I took her for a sober, honest, modest girl, and, 
as I said, one that my children loved mighty well, 
and I was in earnest with her ; if she would give me 
her consent, I would give her my word that I would 
have her, and we would be married to-morrow morn- 
ing. She looked up again at that, and smiled a little, 
and said no, that was too soon too to say yes. She 
hoped I would give her some time to consider of it, 
and to talk with her father about it 

I told her she needed not much time to consider 
about it ; but, however, I would give her till to-morrow 
morning, which was a great while. By this time I 
had kissed Moggy two or three times, and she be- 
gan to be freer with me; and when I pressed her 
to marry me the next morning, she laughed, and 
told me it was not lucky to be married in her old 
clothes. 

I stopped her mouth presently with that, and told 
her she should not be married in her old clothes, for I 
would give her some new. " Ay, it may be after- 
wards," says Moggy, and laughed again. " No, just 
now,"" says I. " Come along with me, Moggy;" so 
I carried her upstairs into my wife's room that was, 
and showed her a new morning-gown of my wifeX 
[119] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

that she had never worn above two or three times, 
and several other fine things. "Look you there, 
Moggy ," says I, " there is a wedding-gown for you ; 
give me your hand now that you will have me to- 
morrow morning. And as to your father, you know 
he has gone to Liverpool on my business, but I will 
answer for it he shall not be angry when he comes 
home to call his master son-in-law ; and I ask him 
no portion. Therefore give me thy hand for it, 
Moggy," says I very merrily to her, and kissed her 
again ; and the girl gave me her hand, and very 
pleasantly too, and I was mightily pleased with it, 
I assure you. 

There lived about three doors from us an ancient 
gentleman who passed for a doctor of physic, but who 
was really a Romish priest in orders, as there are 
many in that part of the country ; and in the even- 
ing I sent to speak with him. He knew that I 
understood his profession, and that I had lived in 
popish countries, and, in a word, believed me a 
Roman too, for I was such abroad. When he came 
to me I told him the occasion for which I sent for 
him, and that it was to be to-morrow morning. He 
readily told me, if I would come and see him in the 
evening, and bring Moggy with me, he would marry 
us in his own study, and that it was rather more pri- 
vate to do it in the evening than in the morning. 
So I called Moggy again to me, and told her, since 
[120] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

she and I had agreed the matter for to-morrow, it 
was as well to be done over-night, and told her what 
the doctor had said. 

Moggy blushed again, and said she must go home 
first, that she could not be ready before to-morrow. 
" Look ye, Moggy," says I, " you are my wife now, 
and you shall never go away from me a maid. I know 
what you mean ; you would go home to shift you. 
Come, Moggy," says I, " come along with me again 
upstairs." So I carried her to a chest of linen, where 
were several new shifts of my last wife's, which she 
had never worn at all, and some that had been worn. 

" There is a clean smctek for you, Moggy," says I, 
"and to-morrow you shall have all the rest." When 
I had done this, "Now, Moggy," says I, "go and 
dress you ; " so I locked her in, and went downstairs. 
" Knock," says I* " when you are dressed." 

After some time Moggy did not knock, but down 
she came into my room, completely dressed, for there 
were several other things that I bade her take, and 
the clothes fitted her as if they had been made for 
her. It seems she slipped the lock back. 

" Well, Moggy," says I, " now you see you shan't 
be married in your old clothes ; " so I took her in 
my arms and kissed her ; and well pleased I was as 
ever I was in my life, or with anything I ever did in 
my life. As soon as it was dark Moggy slipped away 
beforehand, as the doctor and I had agreed, to the 
[181] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

old gentleman's housekeeper, and I came in about 
half-an-hour after ; and there we were married in the 
doctor's study — that is to say, in his oratory or 
chapel, a little room within his study — and we 
stayed and supped with him afterwards. 

Then, after a short stay more, I went home first, 
because I would send the children all to bed, and 
the other servants out of the way ; and Moggy came 
some time after, and so we lay together that night. 
The next morning I let all the family know that 
Moggy was my wife, and my three children were 
rejoiced at it to the last degree. And now I was a 
married man a fourth time; and, in short, I was 
really more happy in this plain country girl than 
with any of all the wives I had had. She was not 
young, being about thirty-three, but she brought me 
a son the first year. She was very pretty, well-shaped, 
and of a merry, cheerful disposition, but not a beauty. 
She was an admirable family manager, loved my 
former children, and used them not at all the worse 
for having some of her own. In a word, she made me 
an excellent wife, but lived with me but four years, 
and died of a hurt she got of a fall while she was 
with child, and in her I had a very great loss indeed. 

And yet such was my fate in wives, that, after all 

the blushing and backwardness of Mrs. Moggy at 

first, Mrs. Moggy had, it seems, made a slip in her 

younger days, and was got with child ten years 

[122]

before, by a gentleman of a great estate in that 
country, who promised her marriage, and afterwards 
deserted her. But as that had happened long before 
I came into the country, and the child was dead and 
forgotten, the people were so good to her, and so 
kind to me, that, hearing I had married her, nobody 
ever spoke of it ; neither did I ever hear of it or sus- 
pect it till after she was in her grave, and then it 
was of small consequence to me one way or other ; 
and she was a faithful, virtuous, obliging wife to me. 
I had very severe affliction indeed while she lived 
with me ; for the smallpox, a frightful distemper in 
that country, broke into my family, and carried off 
three of my children and a maid-servant ; so that I 
had only one of my former wife's, and one by my 
Moggy, the first a son, the last a daughter. 

While these things were in agitation came on the 
invasion of the Scots and the fight at Preston ; and I 
have cause to bless the memory of my Moggy ; for I 
was all on fire on that side, and just going away with 
horse and arms to join the Lord Derwentwater. 
But Moggy begged me off (as I may call it), and 
hung about me so with her tears and importunities 
that I sat still and looked on; for which I had 
reason to be thankful. 

I was really a sorrowful father, and the loss of my 
children stuck close to me ; but the loss of my wife 
stuck closer to me than all the rest. Nor was my 
[128] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

grief lessened or my kindest thoughts abated in the 
least by the account I heard of her former miscar- 
riages, seeing they were so long before I knew her, and 
were not discovered by me or to me in her lifetime. 

All these things put together made me very com- 
fortless. And now I thought Heaven summoned me 
to retire to Virginia, the place, and, as I may say, the 
only place, I had been blessed at, or had met with 
anything that deserved the name of success in, and 
where, indeed, my affairs being in good hands, the 
plantations were increased to such a degree that some 
years my return here made up eight hundred pounds, 
and one year almost a thousand. So I resolved to 
leave my native country once more, and taking my 
son with me, and leaving Moggy's daughter with her 
grandfather, I made him my principal agent, left 
him considerable in his hands for the maintenance of 
the child, and left my will in his hand, by which, if 
I died before I should otherwise provide for her, I 
left her i?£000 portion, to be paid by my son out of 
the estate I had in Virginia, and the whole estate, if 
he died unmarried. 

I embarked for Virginia in the year , at the 

town of Liverpool, and had a tolerable voyage 
thither, only that we met with a pirate ship, in the 
latitude of 48 degrees, who plundered us of every- 
thing they could come at that was for their turn ; 
that is to say, provisions, ammunition, small-arms, 

[1*4] 



THE LIFE OP COLONEL JACQUE 

and money. But, to give the rogues their due, 
though they were the most abandoned wretches that 
were ever seen, they did not use us ill. And as to 
my loss, it was not considerable ; the cargo which I 
had on board was in goods, and was of no use to 
them ; nor could they come at those things without 
rummaging the whole ship, which they did not think 
worth their while. 

I found all ray affairs in very good order at Vir- 
ginia, my plantations prodigiously increased, and 
my manager, who first inspired me with travelling 
thoughts, and made me master of any knowledge 
worth naming, received me with a transport of joy, 
after a ramble of four-and-twenty years. 

I ought to remember it, to the encouragement of 
all faithful servants, that he gave me an account, 
which, I believe, was critically just, of the whole 
affairs of the plantations, each by themselves, and 
balanced in years, every year's produce being fully 
transmitted, charges deducted, to my order at 
London. 

I was exceedingly satisfied, as I had good reason 
indeed, with his management ; and with his manage- 
ment, as much in its degree, of his own I can safely 
say it He had improved a very large plantation of 
his own at the same time, which he began upon the 
foot of the country's allowance of land and the en- 
couragement he had from me. 
[126] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

When he had given me all this pleasing, agreeable 
account, you will not think it strange that I had a 
desire to see the plantations, and to view all the 
servants, which, in both the works, were upwards of 
three hundred ; and as my tutor generally bought 
some every fleet that came from England, I had the 
mortification to see two or three of the Preston 
gentlemen there, who, being prisoners of war, were 
spared from the public execution, and sent over to 
that slavery, which to gentlemen must be worse than 
death. 

I do not mention what I did or said relating to 
them here. I shall speak at large of it when the rest 
of them came over, which more nearly concerned me. 

But one circumstance occurred to me here that 
equally surprised me and terrified me to the last 
degree. Looking over all the servants, as I say 
above, and viewing the plantations narrowly and 
frequently, I came one day by a place where some 
women were at work by themselves. I was seriously 
reflecting on the misery of human life, when I saw 
some of those poor wretches. Thought I, " They 
have perhaps lived gay and pleasantly in the world, 
notwithstanding, through a variety of distresses, 
they may have been brought to this ; and if a body 
was to hear the history of some of them now, it 
would [perhaps be as moving and as seasonable a 
sermon as any minister in the country could preach." 
[ 126 ] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

While I was musing thus and looking at the 
women, on a sudden I heard a combustion among 
other of the women-servants, who were almost be- 
hind me, in the same work, and help was called 
loudly for, one of the women having swooned away. 
They said she would die immediately if something 
was not done to relieve her. I had nothing about 
me but a little bottle, which we always carried about 
us there with rum, to give any servant a dram that 
merited that favour; so I turned my horse and 
went up towards the place. But as the poor creat- 
ure was lying flat on the ground, and the rest of the 
women-servants about her, I did not see her, but 
gave them the bottle, and they rubbed her temples 
with it, and, with much ado, brought her to life, 
and gave her a little to drink. But she could drink 
none of it, and was exceeding ill afterwards, so that 
she was carried to the infirmary — so they call it in 
the religious houses in Italy where the sick nuns and 
friars are carried ; but here, in Virginia, I think they 
should call it the condemned hole, for it really was 
only a placfe just fit for people to die in, not a place 
to be cured in. 

The sick woman refusing to drink, one of the 
women-servants brought me the bottle again, and I 
bade them drink it among them, which had almost 
set them together by the ears for the liquor, there 
being not enough to give every one a sup. 
[127] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

I went home to my house immediately, and 
reflecting on the miserable provision was wont to 
be made for poor servants when they were sick, 
I inquired of my manager if it was so still. He 
said he believed mine was better than any in the 
country ; but he confessed it was but sad lodging. 
However, he said he would go and look after it 
immediately and see how it was. 

He came to me again about an hour after, and 
told me the woman was very ill, and frighted with 
her condition ; that she seemed to be very penitent 
for some things in her past life, which lay heavy 
upon her mind, believing she should die ; that she 
asked him if there was no minister to comfort poor 
dying servants ; and he told her that she knew they 
had no minister nearer than such a place, but that, 
if she lived till morning, he should be sent for. He 
told me, also, that he had removed her into a room 
where their chief workman used to lodge ; that he 
had given her a pair of sheets, and everything he 
could that he thought she wanted, and had appointed 
another woman-servant to tend her and sit up with 
her. 

" Well," says I, " that ''s well ; for I cannot bear 
to have poor creatures lie and perish, by the mere 
hardship of the place they are in, when they are 
sick and want help. Besides," said I, "some of those 
unfortunate creatures they call convicts may be peo- 
[128] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

pie that have been tenderly brought up." " Really, 
sir," says he, " this poor creature, I always said, had 
something of a gentlewoman in her. I could see it 
by her behaviour, and I have heard the other women 
say that she lived very great once, and that she had 
fifteen hundred pound to her portion ; and I dare 
say she has been a handsome woman in her time, 
and she has a hand as fine as a lady's now, though 
it be tanned with the weather. I dare say she was 
never brought up to labour as she does here, and 
she says to the rest that it will kill her." 

" Truly," says I, " it may be so, and that may be 
the reason that she faints under it ; " and I added, 
" Is there nothing you can put her to within doors 
that may not be so laborious and expose her to so 
much heat and cold ? " He told me yes, there was. 
He could set her to be the housekeeper, for the 
woman that lately was such was out of her time, 
and was married and turned planter. " Why, then, 
let her have it," said I, " if she recovers ; and in the 
meantime go," said I, " and tell her so ; perhaps the 
comfort of it may help to restore her." 

He did so, and with that, taking good care of her, 
and giving her good warm diet, the woman recovered, 
and in a little time was abroad again ; for it was the 
mere weight of labour, and being exposed to hard 
lodging and mean diet, to one so tenderly bred, that 
struck her and she fainted at her work. 
VOL.H.— 9 [129] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

When she was made housekeeper she was quite 
another body. She put all the household into such 
excellent order, and managed their provisions so 
well, that my tutor admired her conduct, and would 
be every now and then speaking of her to me, that 
she was an excellent manager. u 1 11 warrant," says 
he, " she has been bred a gentlewoman, and she has 
been a fine woman in her time too." In a word, he 
said so many good things of her that I had a mind 
to see her. So one day I took occasion to go to the 
plantation-house, as they called it, and into a par- 
lour always reserved for the master of the plantation. 
There she had opportunity to see me before I could 
see her, and as soon as she had seen me she knew 
me; but indeed had I seen her an hundred times I 
should not have known her. She was, it seems, in 
the greatest confusion and surprise at seeing who I 
was that it was possible for any one to be; and when 
I ordered my manager to bring her into the room, 
he found her crying, and begged him to excuse her, 
that she was frighted, and should die away if she 
came near me. 

I, not imagining anything but that the poor 
creature was afraid of me (for masters in Virginia 
are terrible things), bade him tell her she need to 
be under no concern at my calling for her ; for it 
was not for any hurt nor for any displeasure, but 
that I had some orders to give her. So, having, as 
[130] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

he thought, encouraged her, though her surprise was 
of another kind, he brought her in. When she came 
in she held a handkerchief in her hand, wiping her 
eyes, as if she had cried. " Mrs. Housekeeper," said 
I, speaking cheerfully to her, " don't be concerned 
at my sending for you ; I have had a very good 
account of your management, and I called for you 
to let you know I am very well pleased with it; and 
if it falls in my way to do you any good, if your 
circumstances will allow it, I may be willing enough 
to help you out of your misery ." 

She made low courtesies, but said nothing. How- 
ever, she was so far encouraged that she took her 
hand from her face, and I saw her face fully ; and I 
believe she did it desiring I should discover who she 
was ; but I really knew nothing of her, any more 
than if I had never seen her in my life, but went on, 
as I thought, to encourage her, as I used to do with 
any that I saw deserved it. 

In the meantime my tutor, who was in the room, 
went out on some business or other — I know not 
what. As soon as he was gone she burst out into a 
passion, and fell down on her knees just before me : 
" Oh, sir ! " says she, " I see you don't know me. 
Be merciful to me; I am your miserable divorced 
wife!" 

I was astonished ; I was frighted ; I trembled like 
one in an ague ; I was speechless ; in a word, I was 

[131] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

ready to sink, and she fell flat on her face, and lay 
there as if she had been dead. I was speechless, I 
say, as a stone. I had only presence of mind enough 
to step to the door and fasten it, that my tutor 
might not come in ; then, going back to her, I took 
her up and spoke comfortably to her, and told her I 
no more knew her than if I had never seen her. 

" Oh, sir ! " said she, u afflictions are dreadful 
things ; such as I have suffered have been enough to 
alter my countenance ; but forgive," said she, " for 
GkxTs sake, the injuries I have done you. I have 
paid dear for all my wickedness, and it is just, it is 
righteous, that God should bring me to your foot, 
to ask your pardon for all my brutish doings. For- 
give me, sir," said she, " I beseech you, and let me be 
your slave or servant for it as long as I live ; it is all 
I ask ; " and with those words she fell upon her knees 
again and cried so vehemently that it was impossible 
for her to stop it or to speak a word more. I took 
her up again, made her sit down, desired her to 
compose herself, and to hear what I was going to 
say ; though indeed it touched me so sensibly that 
I was hardly able to speak any more than she was. 

First, I told her it was such a surprise to me that 
I was not able to say much to her ; and indeed the 
tears run down my face almost as fast as they did on 
hers. I told her that I should only tell her now, 
that, as nobody had yet known anything that had 
[182] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

passed, so it was absolutely necessary not a word of 
it should be known ; that it should not be the worse 
for her that she was thus thrown in my hands again ; 
but that I could do nothing for her if it was known, 
and, therefore, that her future good or ill fortune 
would depend upon her entire concealing it ; that, 
as my manager would come in again presently, she 
should go back to her part of the house, and go on 
in the business as she did before ; that I would come 
to her and talk more at large with her in a day or 
two. So she retired, after assuring me that not a 
word of it should go out of her mouth ; and indeed 
she was willing to retire before my tutor came again, 
that he might not see the agony she was in. 

I was so perplexed about this surprising incident 
that I hardly knew what I did or said all that night; 
nor was I come to any settled resolution in the morn- 
ing what course to take in it However, in the 
morning I called my tutor, and told him that I had 
been exceedingly concerned about the poor distressed 
creature, the housekeeper ; that I had heard some 
of her story, which was very dismal ; that she had 
been in very good circumstances and was bred very 
well, and that I was glad he had removed her 
out of the field into the house ; but still she was 
almost naked, and that I would have him go down 
to the warehouse and give her some linen, especially 
head-clothes, and all sorts of small things such as 
[188] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

hoods, gloves, stockings, shoes, petticoats, &c, and 
to let her choose for herself; also a morning-gown 
of calico, and a mantua of a better kind of calico ; 
that is to say, new clothe her ; which he did, but 
brought me word that he found her all in tears, and 
that she had cried all night long, and, in short, he 
believed she would indeed cry herself to death ; that 
all the while she was receiving the things he gave her 
she cried ; that now and then she would struggle 
with and stop it, but that then, upon another word 
speaking, she would burst out again, so that it grieved 
everybody that saw her. 

I was really affected with her case very much, but 
struggled hard with myself to hide it, and turned 
the discourse to something else. In the meantime, 
though I did not go to her the next day, nor till the 
third day, yet I studied day and night how to act, 
and what I should do in this remarkable case. 

When I came to the house, which was the third 
day, she came into the room I was in, clothed all 
over with my things which I had ordered her, and 
told me she thanked God she was now my servant 
again and wore my livery, thanked me for the 
clothes I had sent her, and said it was much more 
than she had deserved from me. 

I then entered into discourses with her, nobody 
being present but ourselves ; and first I told her she 
should name no more of the unkind things that had 
[134] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

passed, for she had humbled herself more than 
enough on that subject, and I would never reproach 
her with anything that was past. I found that she 
had been the deepest sufferer by far. I told her it 
was impossible for me, in my present circumstances, 
to receive her there as a wife who came over as a 
convict, neither did she know so little as to desire it ; 
but I told her I might be instrumental to put an 
end to her misfortunes in the world, and especially 
to the miserable part of it which was her present 
load, provided she could effectually keep her own 
counsel and never let the particulars come out of her 
mouth, and that from the day she did she might 
date her irrevocable ruin. 

She was as sensible of the necessity of that part 
as I was, and told me all she could claim of me 
would be only to deliver her from her present calam- 
ity that she was not able to support ; and that then, 
if I pleased, she might live such a life as that she 
might apply the residue of what time she should 
have wholly to repentance ; that she was willing to 
do the meanest offices in the world for me; and 
though she should rejoice to hear that I would for- 
give her former life, yet that she would not look 
any higher than to be my servant as long as she 
lived ; and, in the meantime, I might be satisfied she 
would never let any creature so much as know that 
I had ever seen her before. 

[135] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

I asked her if she was willing to let me into any 
part of the history of her life since she and I parted ; 
but I did not insist upon it otherwise than as she 
thought convenient. She said, as her breach with 
me began first in folly and ended in sin, so her whole 
life afterwards was a continued series of calamity, 
sin and sorrow, sin and shame, and at last misery ; 
that she was deluded into gay company and to an 
expensive way of living which betrayed her to several 
wicked courses to support the expenses of it ; that 
after a thousand distresses and difficulties, being not 
able to maintain herself, she was reduced to extreme 
poverty ; that she would many times have humbled 
herself to me in the lowest and most submissive 
manner in the world, being sincerely penitent for her 
first crime, but that she could never hear of me, nor 
which way I was gone ; that she was by that means 
so abandoned that she wanted bread, and those 
wants and distresses brought her into bad company 
of another kind, and that she fell in among a gang 
of thieves, with whom she herded for some time, and 
got money enough a great while, but under the 
greatest dread and terror imaginable, being in the 
constant fear of coming to shame ; that afterwards 
what she feared was come upon her, and for a very 
trifling attempt in which she was not principal, but 
accidentally concerned, she was sent to this place. 
She told me her life was such a collection of various 
[136] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

fortunes — up and down, in plenty and in misery, in 
prison and at liberty, at ease and in torment — that 
it would take up a great many days to give me a 
history of it ; that I was come to see the end of it 
as I had seen the best part of the beginning ; that 
I knew she was brought up tenderly and fared deli- 
cately; but that now she was, with the prodigal, 
brought to desire husks with swine, and even to 
want that supply. Her tears flowed so strongly 
upon this discourse that they frequently interrupted 
her, so that she could not go on without difficulty, 
and at last could not go on at all. So I told her I 
would excuse her telling any more of her story at 
that time ; that I saw it was but a renewing of her 
grief, and that I would rather contribute to her for- 
getting what was past, and desired her to say no more 
of it ; so I broke off that part 

In the meantime I told her, since Providence had 
thus cast her upon my hands again, I would take 
care that she should not want, and that she should 
not live hardly neither, though I could go no further 
at present ; and thus we parted for that time, and 
she continued in the business of housekeeper ; only 
that, to ease her, I gave her an assistant ; and, 
though I would not have it called so, it was neither 
more or less than a servant to wait on her and do 
everything for her ; and told her, too, that it was so. 

After she had been some time in this place she 
[137] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

recovered her spirits and grew cheerful; her fallen 
flesh plumped up, and the sunk and hollow parts 
filled again, so that she began to recover something 
of that brightness and charming countenance which 
was once so very agreeable to me ; and sometimes I 
could not help having warm desires towards her, and 
of taking her into her first station again ; but there 
were many difficulties occurred which I could not get 
over a great while. 

But in the meantime another odd accident hap- 
pened which put me to a very great difficulty, and 
more than I could have thought such a thing could 
be capable of. My tutor, a man of wit and learning, 
and full of generous principles, who was at first 
moved with compassion for the misery of this gentle- 
woman, and, even then, thought there were some 
things more than common in her, as I have hinted ; 
now when, as I say, she was recovered, and her 
sprightly temper restored and comforted, he was 
charmed so with her conversation that, in short, he 
fell in love with her. 

I hinted in my former account of her that she had 
a charming tongue, was mistress of abundance of wit, 
that she sung incomparably fine, and was perfectly 
well-bred. These all remained with her still, and 
made her a very agreeable person ; and, in short, he 
came to me one evening and told me that he came 
to ask my leave to let him many the housekeeper. 
[188] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

* 

I was exceedingly perplexed at this proposal, but, 
however, I gave him no room to perceive that. I 
told him I hoped he had considered well of it before 
he brought it so far as to offer it to me, and sup- 
posed that he had agreed that point so that I had 
no consent to give, but as she had almost four years 
of her time to serve. 

He answered no ; he paid such a regard to me that 
he would not so much as take one step in such a 
thing without my knowledge, and assured me he had 
not so much as mentioned it to her. I knew not 
what answer indeed to make to him, but at last I 
resolved to put it off from myself to her, because 
then I should have opportunity to talk with her 
beforehand. So I told him he was perfectly free to 
act in the matter as he thought fit; that I could 
not say either one thing or another to it, neither 
had I any right to meddle in it As to her serving 
out her time with me, that was a trifle, and not 
worth naming, but I hoped he would consider well 
every circumstance before he entered upon such an 
affair as that. 

He told me he had fully considered it already, and 
that he was resolved, seeing I was not against it, to 
have her whatever came of it, for he believed he 
should be the happiest man alive with her. Then 
he ran on in his character of her, how clever a woman 
she was in the management of all manner of business, 
[139] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

how admirable conversation she was, what a wit, 
what a memory, what a vast share of knowledge, and 
the like ; all which I knew to be the truth, and yet 
short of her just character too ; for, as she was all 
that formerly when she was mine, she was vastly im- 
proved in the school of affliction, and was all the 
bright part, with a vast addition of temper, prudence, 
judgment, and all that she formerly wanted. 

I had not much patience, as you may well imagine, 
till I saw my honest housekeeper, to communicate 
this secret to her, and to see what course she would 
steer on so nice an occasion. But I was suddenly 
taken so ill with a cold which held for two days that 
I could not stir out of doors ; and in this time the 
matter was all done and over ; for my tutor had gone 
the same night and made his attack ; but was coldly 
received at first, which very much surprised him, for 
he made no doubt to have her consent at first word. 
However, the next day he came again, and again the 
third day, when, finding he was in earnest, and yet 
that she could not think of anything of that kind, 
she told him, in few words, that she thought herself 
greatly obliged to him for such a testimony of his 
respect to her, and should have embraced it willingly, 
as anybody would suppose one in her circumstances 
should do, but that she would not abuse him so much, 
for that she must acknowledge to him she was under 
obligations that prevented her ; that was, in short, 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

that she was a married woman and had a husband 
alive. 

This was so sincere but so effectual an answer that 
he could have no room to reply one word to it, but 
that he was very sorry, and that it was a very great 
affliction to him, and as great a disappointment as 
ever he met with. 

The next day after he had received this repulse I 
came to the; plantation-house, and, sending for the 
housekeeper, I began with her, and told her that I 
understood she would have a very advantageous pro- 
posal made to her, and that I would have her con- 
sider well of it, and then told her what my tutor had 
said to me. 

She immediately fell a-crying, at which I seemed 
to wonder very much. " Oh, sir ! " says she, " how 
can you name such a thing tome?" I told her that 
I could name it the better to her because I had been 
married myself since I parted from her. " Yes, sir," 
says she ; " but the case alters ; the crime being on 
my side, I ought not to marry ; but," says she, " that 
is not the reason at all, but I cannot do it" I pre- 
tended to press her to it, though not sincerely, I 
must acknowledge, for my heart had turned toward 
her for some time, and I had fully forgiven her in 
my mind all her former conduct ; but, I say, I seemed 
to press her to it, at which she burst out in a passion. 
"No, no," says she; "let me be your slave rather 
[141] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

than the best man's wife in the world." I reasoned 
with her upon her circumstances, and how such a 
marriage would restore her to a state of ease and 
plenty, and none in the world might ever know or 
suspect who or what she had been. But she could 
not bear it ; but, with tears, again raising her voice 
that I was afraid she would be heard, "I beseech 
you," says she, " do not speak of it any more. I was 
once yours, and I will never belong to any man else 
in the world. Let me be as I am, or anything else 
you please to make me, but not a wife to any man 
alive but yourself." 

I was so moved with the passion she was in at 
speaking this that I knew not what I said or did for 
some time. At length I said to her, " It is a great 
pity you had not long ago been as sincere as you are 
now ; it had been better for us both. However, as 
it is, you shall not be forced to anything against 
your mind, nor shall you be the worse treated for 
refusing ; but how will you put him off? No doubt 
he expects you will receive his proposal as an advan- 
tage; and as he sees no farther into your circum- 
stances, so it is." ** Oh, sir ! " says she, " I have 
done all that already. He has his answer, and is 
fully satisfied. He will never trouble you any more 
on that head ; " and then she told me what answer 
she had given him. 

From that minute I resolved that I would cer- 
[142] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

tainly take her again to be my wife as before. I 
thought she had fully made me amends for her 
former ill conduct, and she deserved to be forgiven 
(and so indeed she did, if ever woman did, consider- 
ing also what dreadful penance she had undergone, 
and how long she had lived in misery and distress) ; 
and that Providence had, as it were, cast her upon 
me again, and, above all, had given her such an af- 
fection to me and so resolved a mind that she could 
refuse so handsome an offer of deliverance rather 
than be farther separated from me. 

As I resolved this in my mind, so I thought it was 
cruel to conceal it any longer from her. Nor, in- 
deed, could I contain myself any longer, but I took 
her in my arms : " Well," says I, " you have given 
me such a testimony of affection in this that I can 
no longer withstand. I forgive you all that ever 
was between us on this account, and, since you will 
be nobody's but mine, you shall be mine again as 
you were at first" 

But this was too much for her the other way, and 
now she was so far overcome with my yielding to her 
that, had she not got vent to her passion by the 
most vehement crying, she must have died in my 
arms; and I was forced to let her go and set her 
down in a chair, where she cried for a quarter of an 
hour before she could speak a word. 

When she was come to herself enough to talk 
[148] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

again, I told her we must consider of a method how 
to bring this to pass, and that it must not be done 
by publishing there that she was my wife before, for 
that would expose us both, but that I would openly 
marry her again. This she agreed was very rational, 
and accordingly, about two months after, we were 
married again, and no man in the world ever enjoyed 
a better wife or lived more happy than we both did 
for several years after. 

And now I began to think my fortunes were 
settled for this world, and I had nothing before me 
but to finish a life of infinite variety, such as mine 
had been, with a comfortable retreat, being both 
made wiser by our sufferings and difficulties, and able 
to judge for ourselves what kind of life would be 
best adapted to our present circumstances, and in 
what station we might look upon ourselves to be 
most completely happy. 

But man is a short-sighted creature at best, and in 
nothing more than in that of fixing his own felicity, 
or, as we may say, choosing for himself. One would 
have thought, and so my wife often suggested to me, 
that the state of life that I was now in was as per- 
fectly calculated to make a man completely happy as 
any private station in the world could be. We had 
an estate more than sufficient, and daily increasing, 
for the supporting any state or figure that in that 
place we could propose to ourselves or even desire 
[ 144 ] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

to live in ; we had everything that was pleasant and 
agreeable, without the least mortification in any cir- 
cumstances of it ; every sweet thing, and nothing to 
embitter it ; every good, and no mixture of evil with 
it ; nor any gap open where we could have the least 
apprehensions of any evil breaking out upon us. 
Nor indeed was it easy for either of us, in our 
phlegmatic, melancholy notions, to have the least 
imagination how anything disastrous could happen 
to us in the common course of things, unless some- 
thing should befall us out of the ordinary way of 
Providence, or of its acting in the world. 

But an unseen mine blew up all this apparent 
tranquillity at once ; and though it did not remove 
my affairs there from me, yet it effectually removed 
me from them and sent me a-wandering into the 
world again — a condition full of hazards, and 
always attended with circumstances dangerous to 
mankind, while he is left to choose his own fortunes 
and be guided by his own short-sighted measures. 

I must now return to a circumstance of my history 
which had been past for some time, and which re- 
lates to my conduct while I was last in England. 

I mentioned how my faithful wife Moggy, with 
her tears and her entreaties, had prevailed with me 
not to play the madman and openly join in the re- 
bellion with the late Lord Derwentwater and his 
party when they entered Lancashire, and thereby, 
vol. ii. — 10 [ 145 ] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

as I may say, saved my life. But my curiosity pre- 
vailed so much at last that I gave her the slip when 
they came to Preston, and at least thought I would 
go and look at them, and see what they were likely 
to come to. 

My former wife's importunities, as above, had 
indeed prevailed upon me from publicly embarking 
in that enterprise and joining openly with them in 
arms ; and by this, as I have observed, she saved my 
life to be sure, because I had then publicly espoused 
the rebellion, and had been known to have bee* 
among them, which might have been as fatal to me 
afterwards, though I had not been taken in the 
action, as if I had. 

But when they advanced and came nearer to us to 
Preston, and there appeared a greater spirit among 
the people in their favour, my old doctor, whom I 
mentioned before, who was a Romish priest, and 
had married us, inspired me with new zeal, and gave 
me no rest till he obliged me, with only a good 
horse and arms, to join them the day before they 
entered Preston, he himself venturing in the same 
posture with me. 

I was not so public here as to be very well known, 
at least by any one that had knowledge of me in the 
country where I lived; and this was indeed my 
safety afterwards, as you will soon hear. But yet 
I was known too among the men, especially among 
[146] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

the Scots, with some of whom I had been acquainted 
in foreign service. With these I was particularly 
conversant, and, passing for a French officer, I 
talked to them of making a select detachment to 
defend the pass between Preston and the river and 
bridge, upon maintaining which, as I insisted, de- 
pended the safety of the whole party. 

It was with some warmth that I spoke of that 
affair, and as I passed among them, I say, for a 
French officer and a man of experience, it caused 
several debates among them. But the hint was not 
followed, as is well known, and from that moment I 
gave them all up as lost, and meditated nothing but 
how to escape from them, which I effected the night 
before they were surrounded by the royal cavalry. I 
did not do this without great difficulty, swimming 
the river Ribble at a place where,' though I got well 
over, yet I could not for a long while get to a place 
where my horse could land himself — that is to say, 
where the ground was firm enough for him to take 
the land. However, at length I got on shore, and 
riding very hard, came the next evening in sight of 
my own dwelling. Here, after lying by in a wood 
till the depth of night, I shot my horse in a little 
kind of a gravel pit, or marl pit, where I soon 
covered him with earth for the present, and march- 
ing all alone, I came about two in the morning to 
my house, where my wife, surprised with joy and yet 
[147] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

terribly frighted, let me in ; and then I took im- 
mediate measures to secure myself upon whatever 
incident might happen, but which, as things were 
ordered, I had no need to make use of, for the rebels 
being entirely defeated, and either all killed or taken 
prisoners, I was not known by anybody in the 
country to have been among them ; no, nor so much 
as suspected. And thus I made a narrow escape 
from the most dangerous action, and most foolishly 
embarked in, of any that I had ever been engaged in 
before. 

It was very lucky to me that I killed and buried 
my horse, for he would have been taken two days 
after, and would, to be sure, have been known by 
those who had seen me upon him at Preston. But 
now, as none knew I had been abroad, nor any such 
circumstance could discover me, I kept close, and as 
my excursion had been short and I had not been 
missed by any of my neighbours, if anybody came to 
speak with me, behold I was at home. 

However, I was not thoroughly easy in my mind, 
and secretly wished I was in my own dominions in 
Virginia, to which, in a little time, other circum- 
stances occurring, I made preparations to remove 
with my whole family. 

In the meantime, as above, the action at Preston 
happened, and the miserable people surrendered to the 
king's troops. Some were executed for examples, as 
[148] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

in such cases is usual, and the government extending 
mercy to the multitude, they were kept in Chester 
Castle, and other places a considerable time, till they 
were disposed of, some one way, some another, as we 
shall hear. 

Several hundreds of them after this were, at their 
own request, transported, as it is vulgarly expressed, 
to the plantations — that is to say, sent to Virginia 
and other British colonies to be sold after the usual 
manner of condemned criminals, or, as we call 
them there, convicts, to serve a limited time in the 
country, and then be made freemen again. Some of 
these I have spoken of above ; but now, to my no 
little uneasiness, I found, after I had been there some 
time, two ships arrived with more of these people in 
the same river where all my plantations lay. 

I no sooner heard of it but the first step I took 
was to resolve to let none of them be bought into 
my work or to any of my plantations ; and this I 
did, pretending that I would not make slaves every 
day of unfortunate gentlemen who fell into that con- 
dition for their zeal to their party only, and the like. 
But the true reason was, that I expected several of 
them would know me, and might perhaps betray me, 
and make it public that I was one of the same sort, 
but had made my escape ; and so I might be brought 
into trouble, and, if I came off with my life, might 
have all my effects seized on, and be reduced to 
[149] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

misery and poverty again at once, all which I 
thought I bad done enough to deserve. 

This was a just caution, but, as I found quickly, 
was not a sufficient one, as my circumstances stood, 
for my safety ; for though I bought none of these 
poor men myself, yet several of my neighbours did, 
and there was scarce a plantation near me but had 
some of them, more or less, among them ; so that, in 
a word, I could not peep abroad hardly but I was in 
danger to be seen, and known too, by some or other 
of them. 

I may be allowed to say that this was a very un- 
easy life to me, and such that, in short, I found 
myself utterly unable to bear ; for I was now reduced 
from a great man, a magistrate, a governor or master 
of three great plantations, and having three or four 
hundred servants at my command, to be a poor self- 
condemned rebel, and durst not show my face ; and 
that I might with the same safety, or rather more, 
have skulked about in Lancashire where I was, or 
gone up to London and concealed myself there till 
things had been over. But now the danger was 
come home to me, even to my door, and I expected 
nothing but to be informed against every day, be 
taken up, and sent to England in irons, and have all 
my plantations seized on as a forfeited estate to the 
Crown. 

J had but one hope of safety to trust to, and that 
[150] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

was, that having been so little a while among them, 
done nothing for them, and passing for a stranger, 
they never knew my name, but only I was called the 
French colonel, or the French officer, or the French 
gentleman by most, if not by all, the people here. 
And as for the doctor that went with me, he had 
found means to escape too, though not the same 
way that I did, finding the cause not likely to be 
supported, and that the king's troops were gathering 
on all sides round them like a cloud. 

But to return to myself; this was no satisfaction 
to me, and. what to do I really knew not, for I was 
more at a loss how to shift in such a distressed case 
as this, now it lay so close to me, than ever I was 
in any difficulty in my life. The first thing I did 
was to come home and make a confidence of the 
whole affair to my wife ; and though I did it gener- 
ously without conditions, yet I did not do it without 
first telling her how I was now going to put my life 
into her hands, that she might have it in her power 
to pay me home for all that she might think had 
been hard in my former usage of her ; and that, in 
short, it would be in her power to deliver me up 
into the hands of my enemies, but that I would 
trust her generosity, as well as her renewed affection, 
and put all upon her fidelity, and without any more 
precaution I opened the whole thing to her, and 
particularly the danger I was now in. 
[151] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

A faithful counsellor is life from the dead, gives 
courage where the heart is sinking, and raises the 
mind to a proper use of means ; and such she was 
to me indeed upon every step of this affair, and it 
was by her direction that I took every step that 
followed for the extricating myself out of this 
labyrinth. 

" Come, come, my dear," says she, u if this be all, 
there is no room for any such disconsolate doings as 
your fears run you upon ; " for I was immediately for 
selling off my plantations and all my stock and em- 
barking myself forthwith, and to get to Madeira or 
to any place out of the king's dominions. 

But my wife was quite of another opinion, and 
encouraging me on another account, proposed two 
things, either my freighting a sloop with provisions 
to the West Indies, and so taking passage from 
thence to London, or letting her go away directly 
for England and endeavour to obtain the king's 
pardon, whatever it might cost. 

I inclined to the last proposal ; for though I was 
unhappily prejudiced in favour of a wrong interest, 
yet I had always a secret and right notion of the 
clemency and merciful disposition of his Majesty, 
and, had I been in England, should, I believe, have 
been easily persuaded to have thrown myself at his 
foot. 

But going to England as I was circumstanced 
[158] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

must have been a public action, and I must have 
made all the usual preparations for it, must have 
appeared in public, have stayed till the crop was 
ready, and gone away in form and state as usual, or 
have acted as if something extraordinary was the 
matter, and have filled the heads of the people there 
with innumerable suggestions of they knew not what. 

But my wife made all this easy to me from her 
own invention ; for, without acquainting me of any- 
thing, she comes merrily to me one morning before 
I was up : " My dear," says she, " I am very sorry to 
hear that you are not very well this morning. I 
have ordered Pennico " (that was a young negro girl 
which I had given her) " to make you a fire in your 
chamber, and pray lie still where you are a while till 
it is done." At the same instant the little negro 
came in with wood and a pair of bellows, &c, to 
kindle the fire, and my wife, not giving me time 
to reply, whispers close to my ear to lie still and say 
nothing till she came up again to me. 

I was thoroughly frighted, that you may be sure 
of, and thought of nothing but of being discovered, 
betrayed, and carried to England, hanged, quartered, 
and all that was terrible, and my very heart sunk 
within me. She perceived my disorder and turned 
back, assuring me there was no harm, desired me to 
be easy, and she would come back again presently 
and give me satisfaction in every particular that I 
[158] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

could desire. So I composed myself a while as well 
as I could, but it was but a little while that I could 
bear it, and I sent Pennico downstairs to find out 
her mistress, and tell her I was very ill and must 
speak with her immediately ; and the girl was scarce 
out of the room before I jumped out of bed and be- 
gan to dress me, that I might be ready for all events. 

My wife was as good as her word, and was coming 
up as the girl was coming down. " I see," says she, 
" you want patience, but pray do not want govern- 
ment of yourself, but take that screen before your 
face, and go to the window and see if you know any 
of those Scotchmen that are in the yard, for there 
are seven or eight of them come about some business 
to your clerk." 

I went and looked through the screen, and saw the 
faces of them all distinctly, but could make nothing 
of them other than that they were Scotchmen, which 
was easy to discern. However, it was no satisfaction 
to me that I knew not their faces, for they might 
know mine for all that, according to the old English 
proverb, "That more knows Tom Fool than Tom 
Fool knows ; " so I kept close in my chamber till I 
understood they were all gone. 

After this my wife caused it to be given out in 

the house that I was not well ; and when this not 

being well had lasted three or four days, I had my 

leg wrapped up in a great piece of flannel and laid 

[154] 



THE LIFE OP COLONEL JACQUE 

upon a stool, and there I was lame of the gout; 
and this served for about six weeks, when my wife 
told me she had given it out that my gout was 
rather rheumatic than a settled gout, and that I was 
resolved to take one of my own sloops and go away 
to Nevis or Antigua, and use the hot baths there for 
my cure. 

All this was very well, and I approved my wife's 
contrivance as admirably good, both to keep me 
within doors eight or ten weeks at first, and to con- 
vey me away afterwards without any extraordinary 
bustle to be made about it ; but still I did not know 
what it all tended to, and what the design of it all 
was. But my wife desired me to leave that to her ; 
so I readily did, and she carried it all on with a 
prudence not to be disputed ; and after she had 
wrapped my legs in flannel almost three months, she 
came and told me the sloop was ready and all the 
goods put on board. " And now, my dear," says 
she, " I come to tell you all the rest of my design ; for," 
added she, " I hope you will not think I am going to 
kidnap you, and transport you from Virginia, as other 
people are transported to it, or that I am going to 
get you sent away and leave myself in possession of 
your estate ; but you shall find me the same faithful, 
humble creature which I should have been if I had 
been still your slave, and not had any hopes of being 
your wife, and that in all my scheme which I have 
[166] 



THE LIFE OP COLONEL JACQUE 

laid for your safety, in this new exigence, I have not 
proposed your going one step but where I shall go 
and be always with you, to assist and serve you on 
all occasions, and to take my portion with you, of 
what kind soever our lot may be." 

This was so generous, and so handsome a declara- 
tion of her fidelity, and so great a token, too, of the 
goodness of her judgment in considering of the 
things which were before her, and of what my present 
circumstances called for, that, from that time forward, 
I gave myself cheerfully up to her management with- 
out any hesitation in the least, and after about ten 
days' 1 preparation we embarked in a large sloop of my 
own of about sixty tons. 

I should have mentioned here that I had still my 
faithful tutor, as I called him, at the head of my 
affairs ; and, as he knew who to correspond with, and 
how to manage the correspondence in England, we 
left all that part to him, as I had done before ; and 
I did this with a full satisfaction in his ability as 
well as in his integrity. It is true he had been a 
little chagrined in that affair of my wife, who, as I 
hinted before, had married me, after telling him, in 
answer to his solicitations, that she had a husband 
alive. Now, though this was literally true, yet, as 
it was a secret not fit to be opened to him, I was 
obliged to put him off with other reasons, as well as 
I could, perhaps not much to the purpose, and per- 
[166] 



THE LIFE OP COLONEL JACQUE 

haps not much to his satisfaction, so that I reckoned 
he looked on himself as not very kindly used several 
ways. But he began to get over it, and to be easy, 
especially at our going away, when he found that the 
trust of everything was still left in his hands as it was 
before. 

When my wife had thus communicated everything 
of the voyage to me, and we began to be ready to go 
off*, she came to me one morning, and, with her usual 
cheerfulness, told me she now came to tell me the 
rest of her measures for the completing my deliver- 
ance ; and this was, that while we made this trip, as 
she called it, to the hot springs at Nevis, she would 
write to a particular friend at London, whom she 
could depend upon, to try to get a pardon for a per- 
son on account of the late rebellion, with all the cir- 
cumstances which my case was attended with, viz., of 
having acted nothing among them but being three 
days in the place ; and, while we were thus absent, 
she did not question but to have an answer, which 
she would direct to come so many ways that we 
would be sure to have the first of it as soon as it was 
possible the vessels could go and come. And in the 
meantime the expense should be very small, for she 
would have an answer to the grand question first, 
whether it could be obtained or no ; and then an 
account of the expense of it, that so I might judge 
for myself whether I would part with the needful 
[157] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

sum or no, before any money was disbursed on my 
account. 

I could not but be thoroughly satisfied with her 
contrivance in this particular, and I had nothing to 
add to it but that I would not have her limit her 
friend so strictly, but that if he saw the way clear, 
and that he was sure to obtain it, he should go 
through stitch with it, if within the expense of two 
or three or four hundred pounds, and that, upon 
advice of its being practicable, he should have bills 
payable by such a person on delivery of the warrant 
for the thing. 

To fortify this, I enclosed in her packet a letter to 
one of my correspondents, whom I could particularly 
trust, with a credit for the money, on such-an-such 
conditions; but the honesty and integrity of my 
wife's correspondence was such as prevented all the 
expense, and yet I had the wished-for security, as if 
it had been all paid, as you shall hear presently. 

All these things being fixed to our minds, and all 
things left behind in good posture of settlement as 
usual, we embarked together and put to sea, having 
the opportunity of an English man-of-war being on 
the coast in pursuit of the pirates, and who was just 
then standing away towards the Gulf of Florida, and 
told us he would see us safe as far as New Providence, 
on the Bahama Islands. 

. And now having fair weather and a pleasant voy- 
[168] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

age, and my flannels taken off my legs, I must hint 
a little what cargo I had with me ; for as my cir- 
cumstances were very good in that country, so I did 
not go such a voyage as this, and with a particular 
reserve of fortunes whatever might afterwards hap- 
pen, without a sufficient cargo for our support, and 
whatever exigence might happen. 

Our sloop, as I said, was of about sixty or seventy 
tons ; and as tobacco, which is the general produce 
of the country, was no merchandise at Nevis, that is 
to say, for a great quantity, so we carried very little, 
but loaded the sloop with corn, peas, meal, and some 
barrels of pork ; and an excellent cargo it was, most 
of it being the produce of my own plantation. We 
took also a considerable sum of money with us in 
Spanish gold, which was, as above, not for trade, 
but for all events. I also ordered another sloop to 
be hired, and to be sent after me, loaden with the 
same goods, as soon as they should have advice from 
me that I was safe arrived. 

We came to the latitude of the island of Antigua, 
which was very near to that of Nevis, whither we 
intended to go, on the eighteenth day after our. 
passing the Capes of Virginia, but had no sight of 
the island ; only our master said he was sure if he 
stood the same course as he then was, and the gale 
held, I say he told me he was sure he should make 
the island in less than five hours' sail ; so he stood 
[159] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

on fair for the islands. However, his account had 
failed him, for we held on all the evening, made no 
land, and likewise all night, when in the grey of the 
morning we discovered from the topmast-head a 
brigantine and a sloop making sail after us, at the 
distance of about six leagues, fair weather, and the 
wind fresh at S.E. 

Our master soon understood what they were, and 
came down into the cabin to me to let me know it. 
I was much surprised, you may be sure, at the 
danger, but my poor wife took from me all the con- 
cern for myself to take care of her, for she was 
frighted to that degree that I thought we should 
not have been able to keep life in her. 

While we were thus under the first hurry and sur- 
prise of the thing, suddenly another noise from the 
deck called us up to look out, and that was, " Land ! 
land ! " The master and I — for by this time I had 
got out of my cabin — run upon the deck, and there 
we saw the state of our case very plain. The two 
rogues that stood after us laid on all the canvas they 
could carry, and crowded after us amain, but at the 
distance, as I have said, of about six leagues, rather 
more than less. On the other hand, the land dis- 
covered lay about nine leagues right ahead, so that 
if the pirates could get of us, so as to sail three feet 
for our two, it was evident they would be up with us 
before we could make the island. If not, we should 
[160] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

escape them and get in ; but even then we had no 
great hope to do any more than to run the ship 
ashore to save our lives, and so, stranding our vessel, 
spoil both sloop and cargo. 

When we were making this calculation our master 
came in cheerfully, and told me he had crowded on 
more sail, and found the sloop carried it very well, 
and that he did not find the rogues gained much 
upon us, and that especially if one of them did not, 
that was the sloop, he found he could go away from 
the brigantine as he pleased. Thus we gave them 
what they call a stern chase, and they worked hard 
to come up with us till towards noon, when on a 
sudden they both stood away and gave us over, to 
our great satisfaction you may be sure. 

We did not, it seems, so easily see the occasion of 
our deliverance as the pirate did ; for while we went 
spooning away large with the wind for one of the 
islands, with those two spurs in our heels, that is, 
with the two thieves at our sterns, there lay an . 
English man-of-war in the road of Nevis, which was 
the same island from whence they espied the pirates, 
but the land lying between, we could not see them. 

As the man-of-war discovered them she immedi- 
ately slipped her cable and put herself under sail in 
chase of the rogues ; and they as soon perceived her, 
and being windward, put themselves upon a wind to 
escape her ; and thus we were delivered, and in half- 
vol. n.— 11 [161] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

» an-hour more we knew who was our deliverer, seeing 
the man-of-war stretch ahead clear of the island, and 
stand directly after the pirates, who now crowded 
from us as fast as they crowded after us before ; and 
thus we got safe into Antigua, after the terrible 
apprehension we had been in of being taken. Our 
apprehensions of being taken now were much more 
than they would have been on board a loaden ship 
from or to London, where the most they ordinarily 
do is to rifle the ship, take what is valuable and 
portable, and let her go. But ours being but a 
sloop, and all our loading being good provisions, 
such as they wanted, to be sure, for their ship's store, 
they would certainly have carried us away, ship and 
all, taken out the cargo and the men, and perhaps 
have set the sloop on fire ; so that, as to our cargo 
of gold, it had been inevitably lost, and we hurried 
away, nobody knows where, and used as such bar- 
barous fellows are wont to use innocent people as 
.fall into their hands. 

But we were now out of their hands, and had the 
satisfaction a few days after to hear that the man- 
of-war pursued them so close, notwithstanding they 
changed their course in the night, that the next day 
they were obliged to separate and shift for them- 
selves ; so the man-of-war took one of them, namely, 
the brigantine, and carried her into Jamaica, but the 
other, viz., the sloop, made her escape. 
[162] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

Being arrived here, we presently disposed of our 
cargo, and at a tolerable good price ; and now the 
question was, what I should do next. I looked upon 
myself to be safe here from the fears I had been 
under of being discovered as a rebel, and so indeed I 
was ; but having been now absent five months, and 
having sent the ship back with a cargo of rum and 
molasses, which I knew was wanting in my planta- 
tions, I received the same vessel back in return loaden, 
as at first, with provisions. 

With this cargo my wife received a packet from 
London from the person whom she had employed, as 
above, to solicit a pardon, who very honestly wrote 
to her that he would not be so unjust to her friend, 
whoever he was, as to put him to any expense for a 
private solicitation ; for that he was very well assured 
that his Majesty had resolved, from his own native dis- 
position to acts of clemency and mercy to his subjects, 
to grant a general pardon, with some few exceptions 
to persons extraordinary, and he hoped her friend was 
none of the extraordinary persons to be excepted. 

This was a kind of life from the dead to us both, 
and it was resolved that my wife should go back in 
the sloop directly to Virginia, where she should wait 
the good news from England, and should send me an 
account of it as soon as she received it. 

Accordingly she went back, and came safe with 
the sloop and cargo to our plantation, from whence, 
[168] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

after above four months' more expectation, behold 
the sloop came to me again, but empty and gutted 
of all her cargo, except about a hundred sacks of 
unground malt, which the pirates, not knowing how 
to brew, knew not what to do with, and so had left 
in her. However, to my infinite satisfaction, there 
was a packet of letters from my wife, with another 
to her from England, as well one from her friend as 
one from my own correspondent ; both of them inti- 
mating that the king had signed an act of grace, 
that is to say, a general free pardon, and sent me 
copies of the act, wherein it was manifest that I was 
fully included. 

And here let me hint, that having now, as it were, 
received my life at the hands of King George, and in 
a manner so satisfying as it was to me, it made a 
generous convert of me, and I became sincerely given 
in to the interest of King George ; and this from a 
principle of gratitude and a sense of my obligation 
to his Majesty for my life ; and it has continued ever 
since, and will certainly remain with me as long as 
any sense of honour and of the debt of gratitude re- 
mains with me. I mention this to hint how far in 
such cases justice and duty to ourselves commands 
us ; namely, that to those who graciously give us our 
lives when it is in their power to take them away, 
those lives are a debt ever after, and ought to be set 
apart for their service and interest as long as any of 
[164] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

the powers of life remain, for gratitude is a debt that 
never ceases while the benefit received remains ; and 
if my prince has given me my life, I can never pay 
the debt fully, unless such a circumstance as this 
should happen, that the prince's life should be in my 
power, and I as generously preserved it. And yet 
neithef would the obligation be paid then, because 
the cases would differ ; thus, that my preserving the 
life of my prince was my natural duty, whereas the 
prince on his side, my life being forfeited to him, 
had no motive but mere clemency and beneficence. 
Perhaps this principle may not please all that read 
it; but as I have resolved to guide my actions in 
things of such a nature by the rules of strict virtue 
and principles of honour, so I must lay it down as 
a rule of honour, that a man having once forfeited 
his life to the justice of his prince and to the laws 
of his country, and receiving it back as a bounty 
from the grace of his sovereign, such a man can never 
lift up his hand again against that prince without a 
forfeiture of his virtue and an irreparable breach of 
his honour and duty, and deserves no pardon after it 
either from God or man. But all this is a digres- 
sion : I leave it as a sketch of the laws of honour, 
printed by the laws of nature in the breast of a 
soldier or a man of honour, and which, I believe, all 
impartial persons who understand what honour means 
will subscribe to. 

[165] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

But I return now to my present circumstances. 
My wife was gone, and with her all my good fortune 
and success in business seemed to have forsaken me ; 
and I had another scene of misery to go through, 
after I had thought that all my misfortunes were 
over and at an end. 

My sloop, as I have told you, arrived, but having 
met with a pirate rogue in the Gulf of Florida, they 
took her first ; then finding her cargo to be all eata- 
bles, which they always want, they gutted her of 
all her loading, except, as I have said, about a hun- 
dred sacks of malt, which they really knew not what 
to do with ; and, which was still worse, they took 
away all the men except the master and two boys, 
who they left on board just to run the vessel into 
Antigua, where they said they were bound. 

But the most valuable part of my cargo, viz., a 
packet of letters from England, those they left, to 
my inexpressible comfort and satisfaction ; and, par- 
ticularly, that by those I saw my way home to return 
to my wife and to my plantations, from which I 
promised myself never to wander any more. 

In order to this, I now embarked myself and 
all my effects on board the sloop, resolving to sail 
directly to the Capes of Virginia. My captain beat- 
ing it up to reach the Bahama channel, had not been 
two days at sea but we were overtaken by a violent 
storm, which drove us so far upon the coast of 
[166] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

Florida as that we twice struck upon the shore, and 
had we struck a third time we had been inevitably 
lost. A day or two after that, the storm abating a 
little, weitept the sea, but found the wind blowing so 
strong against our passing the gulf, and the sea going 
so high, we could not hold it any longer. So we were 
forced to bear away and make what shift we could ; 
in which distress, the fifth day after, we made land, 

but found it to be Cape , the north-west part of 

the isle of Cuba. Here we found ourselves under a 
necessity to run in under the land for shelter, though 
we had not come to an anchor, so we had not touched 
the king of Spain's territories at all. However, in 
the morning we were surrounded with five Spanish 
barks, or boats, such as they call barco longos, full 
of men, who instantly boarded us, took us and 
carried us into the Havannah, the most considera- 
ble port belonging to the Spaniards in that part of 
the world. 

Here the sloop was immediately seized, and in 
consequence plundered, as any one that knows the 
Spaniards, especially in that country, will easily guess. 
Our men were made prisoners and sent to the com- 
mon gaol ; and as for myself and the captain, we 
were carried before the Alcade Major, or intendant 
of the place, as criminals. 

I spoke Spanish very well, having served under the 
king of Spain in Italy, and it stood me in good stead 
[167] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL J ACQUE 

at this time ; for I so effectually argued the injus- 
tice of their treatment of me that the governor, or 
what I ought to call him, frankly owned they ought 
not to have stopped me, seeing I was in the open sea 
pursuing my voyage, and offered no offence to any- 
body, and had not landed or offered to land upon 
any part of his Catholic Majesty's dominions till I 
was brought as a prisoner. 

It was a great favour that I could obtain thus 
much ; but I found it easier to obtain an acknowl- 
edgment that I had received wrong than to get 
any satisfaction for that wrong, and much less was 
there any hope or prospect of restitution; and I 
was let know that I was to wait till an account 
could be sent to the viceroy of Mexico, and orders 
could be received back from him how to act in the 
affair. 

I could easily foresee what all this tended to, 
namely, to a confiscation of the ship and goods by 
the ordinary process at the place ; and that my being 
left to the decision of the viceroy of Mexico was but 
a pretended representation of things to him from 
the corregidore or judge of the place. 

However, I had no remedy but the old insig- 
nificant thing called patience, and this I was better 
furnished with because I did not so much value the 
loss as I made them believe I did. My greatest ap- 
prehensions were that they would detain me and 
[168] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

keep me as a prisoner for life, and perhaps send me 
to their mines in Peru, as they have done many, 
and pretended to do to all that come on shore in 
their dominions, how great soever the distresses 
may have been which have brought them thither, 
and which has been the reason why others who have 
been forced on shore have committed all manner of 
violence upon the Spaniards in their turn, resolving, 
however dear they sold their lives, not to fall into 
their hands. 

But I got better quarter among them than that 
too, which was, as I have said, much of it owing to 
my speaking Spanish, and to my telling them how 
I had fought in so many occasions in the quarrel of 
his Catholic Majesty in Italy ; and, by great good 
chance, I had the king of France's commission for 
lieutenant-colonel in the Irish brigade in my pocket, 
where it was mentioned that the said brigade was 
then serving in the armies of France, under the or- 
ders of his Catholic Majesty, in Italy. 

I failed not to talk up the gallantry and personal 
bravery of his Catholic Majesty on all occasions, and 
particularly in many battles where, by the way, his 
Majesty had never been at all, and in some where I 
had never been myself. But I found I talked to 
people who knew nothing of the matter, and so any- 
thing went down with them if it did but praise the 
king of Spain and talk big of the Spanish cavalry, 
[169] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

of which, God knows, there was not one regiment in 
the army, at least while I was there. 

However, this way of managing myself obtained 
me the liberty of the place, upon my parole that I 
would not attempt an escape ; and I obtained also, 
which was a great favour, to have two hundred 
pieces of eight allowed me out of the sale of my 
cargo for subsistence till I could negotiate my affairs 
at Mexico. As for my men, they were maintained 
as prisoners at the public charge. 

Well, after several months' solicitation and attend- 
ance, all I could obtain was the satisfaction of seeing 
my ship and cargo confiscated and my poor sailors 
in a fair way to be sent to the mines. The last I 
begged off, upon condition of paying three hundred 
pieces of eight for their ransom, and having them 
set on shore at Antigua, and myself to remain host- 
age for the payment of the said three hundred pieces 
of eight, and for two hundred pieces of eight, which 
I had already had, and for five hundred pieces of 
eight more for my own ransom, if, upon a return 
from Mexico, the sentence of confiscation, as above, 
should be confirmed by the viceroy. 

These were hard articles indeed, but I was forced 
to submit to them ; nor, as my circumstances were 
above all such matters as these, as to substance, did 
I lay it much to heart. The greatest difficulty that 
lay in my way was, that I knew not how to corre- 
[170] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

spond with my friends in any part of the world, or 
which way to supply myself with necessaries or with 
money for the payment I had agreed to, the Span- 
iards being so tenacious of their ports that they 
allowed nobody to come on shore, or indeed near 
the shore, from any part of the world, upon pain of 
seizure and confiscation, as had been piiy case already. 
Upon this difficulty I began to reason with the cor- 
regidore, and tell him that he put things upon us 
that were impossible, and that were inconsistent with 
the customs of nations ; that, if a man was prisoner 
at Algiers, they would allow him to write to his 
friends to pay his ransom, and would admit the 
person that brought it to come and go free as a 
public person, and if they did not, no treaty could 
be carried on for the ransom of a slave, nor the con- 
ditions be performed when they are agreed upon. 

I brought it then down to my own case, and de- 
sired to know, upon supposition, that I might, within 
the time limited in that agreement, have the sums 
of money ready for the ransom of my men and of 
myself, how I should obtain to have notice given me 
of it, or how it should be brought, seeing the very 
persons bringing that notice, or afterwards presum- 
ing to bring the money, might be liable to be seized 
and confiscated, as I had been, and the money itself 
be taken as a second prize, without redeeming the 
first* 

[171] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

Though this was so reasonable a request that it 
could not be withstood in point of argument, yet the 
Spaniard shrunk his head into his shoulders, and 
said they had not power sufficient to act in such a 
case ; that the king's laws were so severe against the 
suffering any strangers to set their foot on his 
Catholic Majesty's dominions in America, and they 
could not dispense with the least tittle of them with- 
out a particular assitnto, as they called it, from the 
Consulado, or Chamber of Commerce, at Seville, or 
a command under the hand and seal of the viceroy 
of Mexico. 

" How ! signior corregidore," said I, with some 
warmth, and, as it were, with astonishment, "have 
you not authority enough to sign a passport for an 
agent, or ambassador, to come on shore here, from 
any of the king of Great Britain's governors in these 
parts, under a white flag, or flag of truce, to speak 
with the governor of this place, or with any other 
person in the king's name, on the subject of such 
business as the governor may have to communicate ? 
Why," said I, " if you cannot do that, you cannot 
act according to the law of nations." 

He shook his head, but still said no, he could not 
do even so much as that ; but here one of the mili- 
tary governors put in and opposed him, and they two 
differed warmly, the first insisting that their orders 
were deficient in that particular ; but the other said 
[172] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

that, as they were bound up to them, it could not be 
in their power to act otherwise, and that they were 
answerable for the ill consequences. 

" Well, then," says the governor to the corregidore, 
" now you have kept this Englishman as hostage for 
the ransom of the men that you have dismissed, sup- 
pose he tells you the money is ready, either at such, or 
such, or such a place, how shall he bring it hither ? 
You will take all the people prisoners that offer to 
bring it ; what must he do ? If you say you will send 
and fetch it, what security shall he have that he shall 
have his liberty when it is paid you P and why should 
he trust you so far as to pay the money, and yet re- 
main here a prisoner ?" 

This carried so much reason with it that the cor- 
regidore knew not what to say, but that so was the 
law, and he could act no otherwise but by the very 
letter of it; and here each was so positive that 
nothing could determine it but another express to be 
sent to the viceroy of Mexico. 

Upon this the governor was so kind as to say he 
would get me a passport for anybody that should 
bring the money, and any vessel they were in, by his 
own authority, and for their safe returning, and tak- 
ing me with them, provided I would answer for it 
that they should bring no European or other goods 
whatever with them, and should not set foot on shore 
without his express permission, and provided he did 
[173] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

not receive orders to the contrary, in the meantime, 
from any superior hand ; and that, even in such a 
case, they should have liberty to go back freely 
from whence they came, under the protection of a 
white flag. 

I bowed very respectfully to the governor in token 
of my acknowledging his justice, and then presented 
my humble petition to him that he would allow my 
men to take their own sloop ; that it should be rated 
at a certain value, and would be obliged they should 
bring specie on board with them, and that they 
should either pay it for the sloop or leave the sloop 
again. 

Then he inquired to what country he would send 
them for so much money, and if I could assure him 
of the payment ; and when he understood it was no 
farther than to Virginia he seemed very easy ; and, 
to satisfy the corregidore, who still stood off, adher- 
ing with a true Spanish stiffness to the letter of the 
law, the said governor calls out to me: " Signior," 
says he, " I shall make all this matter easy to you, if 
you agree to my proposal. Your men shall have the 
sloop, on condition you shall be my hostage for her 
return ; but they shall not take her as your sloop, 
though she shall in the effect be yours on the pay- 
ment of the money ; but you shall take two of my 
men on board with you, upon your parole for their 
safe return, and when she returns she shall carry his 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

Catholic Majesty's colours, and be entered as one of 
the sloops belonging to the Havannah ; one of the 
Spaniards to be commander, and to be called by 
such a name as he shall appoint" 

This the corregidore came into immediately, and 
said this was within the letter of the king's com- 
manderie or precept ; upon condition, however, that 
she should bring no European goods on board. I 
desired it might be put in other words ; namely, 
that she should bring no European goods on shore. 
It cost two days' debate between these two whether 
it should pass that no European goods should be 
brought in the ship or brought on shore ; but hav- 
ing found means to intimate that I meant not to 
trade there, but would not be tied from bringing a 
small present to a certain person in acknowledgment 
of favours — I say, after I had found room to place 
such a hint right where it should be placed, I found 
it was all made easy to me ; and it was all agreed 
presently that, after the ransom was paid, and the 
ship also bought, it was but reasonable that I should 
have liberty to trade to any other country not in the 
dominions of the king of Spain, so to make up my 
losses ; and that it would be hard to oblige my men 
to bring away the vessel light, and so lose the voy- 
age, and add so much to our former misfortunes; 
that, so long as no goods were brought on shore in 
the country belonging to his Catholic Majesty's 
[175] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

dominions, which was all that they had to defend, 
the rest was no business of theirs. 

Now I began to see my way through this unhappy 
business, and to find, that as money would bring me 
out of it, so money would bring it to turn to a good 
account another way. Wherefore I sent the sloop 
away under Spanish colours, and called her the 
Nuestra Signiora de la Vol de Grace, commanded 
by Signior Giraldo de Nesma, one of the two 
Spaniards. 

With the sloop I sent letters to my wife and to 
my chief manager with orders to load her back, as I 
there directed, viz., that she should have two hun- 
dred barrels of flour, fifty barrels of pease ; and, to 
answer my other views, I ordered a hundred bales to 
be made up of all sorts of European goods, such as 
not my own warehouses only would supply, but such 
as they could be supplied with in other warehouses 
where I knew they had credit for anything. 

In this cargo I directed all the richest and most 
valuable English g<*ods they had, or could get, 
whether linen, woollen, or silk, to be made up ; the 
coarser things, such as we use in Virginia for clothing 
of servants, such I ordered to be left behind for the 
use of the plantation. In less than seven weeks' 
time the sloop returned, and I, that failed not every 
day to look out for her on the strand, was the first 
that spied her at sea at a distance, and knew her by 
[176] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

her sails, but afterwards more particularly by her 
signals. 

When she returned she came into the road with 
her Spanish ancient flying, and came to an anchor 
as directed ; but I, that had seen her some hours be- 
fore, went directly to the governor and gave him an 
account of her being come, and fain I would have 
obtained the favour to have his excellency, as I 
called him, go on board in person, that he might 
see how well his orders were executed. But he 
declined that, saying he could not justify going off 
of the island, which was, in short, to go out of his 
command of the fort, which he could not reassume 
without a new commission from the king's own 
hand. 

Then I asked leave to go on board myself, which 
he granted me ; and I brought on shore with me the 
full sum in gold which I had conditioned to pay for 
the ransom both of my men and myself, and for the 
purchase of the sloop ; and as I obtained leave to 
land in a different place, so my governor sent his son 
with six soldiers to receive and convey me with the 
money to the castle, where he commanded, and 
therein to his own house. I had made up the 
money in heavy parcels, as if it had been all silver, 
and gave it to two of my men who belonged to the 
sloop, with orders to them that they should make it 
seem, by their carrying it, to be much heavier than 
voun.— 13 [ 177 ] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

it was. This was done to conceal three parcels of 
goods which I had packed up with the money to 
make a present to the governor as I intended. 

When the money was carried in and laid down on 
a table, the governor ordered my men to withdraw, 
and I gave the soldiers each of them a piece of eight 
to drink, for which they were very thankful, and the 
governor seemed well pleased with it also. Then I 
asked him presently if he would please to receive the 
money. He said no, he would not receive it but in 
presence of the corregidore and the other people 
concerned. Then I begged his excellency, as I 
called him, to give me leave to open the parcels in 
his presence, for that I would do myself the honour 
to acknowledge his favours in the best manner I 
could. 

He told me no, he could not see anything be 
brought on shore but the money; but, if I had 
brought anything on shore for my own use, he 
would not be so strict as to inquire into that, so I 
might do what I pleased myself. 

Upon that I went into the place, shut myself in, 
and having opened all the things, placed them to my 
mind. There was five little parcels, as follows : — 

1, 2. A piece of twenty yards fine English broad - 
cloth, five yards black, five yards crimson, in one par- 
cel ; and the rest of fine mixtures in another parcel. 

3. A piece of thirty ells of fine holland linen. 
[178] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

4. A piece of eighteen yards of fine English brocaded 
silk. 

5. A piece of black Colchester bays. 

After I had placed these by themselves, I found 
means, with some seeming difficulties and much 
grimace, to bring him to know that this was intended 
for a present to himself. After all that part was 
over, and he had seemed to accept them, he signified, 
after walking a hundred turns and more in the room 
by them, by throwing his hat, which was under 
his arm, upon them, and making a very stiff bow ; 
I say, after this he seemed to take his leave of me 
for a while, and I waited in an outer room. When 
I was called in again, I found that he had looked 
over all the particulars, and caused them to be 
removed out of the place. 

But when I came again I found him quite another 
man. He thanked me for my present ; told me it 
was a present fit to be given to a viceroy of Mexico 
rather than to a mere governor of a fort ; that he 
had done me no services suitable to such a return, 
but that he would see if he could not oblige me 
further before I left the place. 

After our compliments were over I obtained leave 
to have the corregidore sent for, who accordingly 
came, and in his presence the money stipulated for 
the ransom of the ship and of the men was paid. 

But here the corregidore showed that he would be 
[179] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

as severely just on my side as on theirs, for he would 
not admit the money as a ransom for us as prisoners, 
but as a deposit for so much as we were to be ran- 
somed for if the sentence of our being made prisoners 
should be confirmed. 

And then the governor and corregidore, joining 
together, sent a representation of the whole affair — 
at least we were told so — to the viceroy of Mexico ; 
and it was privately hinted to me that I would do 
well to stay for the return of the aviso — that is, a 
boat which they send over the bay to Vera Cruz with 
an express to Mexico, whose return is generally per- 
formed in two months. 

I was not unwilling to stay, having secret hints 
given me that I should find some way to go with my 
sloop towards Vera Cruz myself, where I might have 
an occasion to trade privately for the cargo which I 
had on board. But it came about a nearer way ; 
for, about two days after this money being deposited, 
as above, the governor's son invited himself on board 
my sloop, where I told him I would be very glad to 
see him, and whither, at the same time, he brought 
with him three considerable merchants, Spaniards, 
two of them not inhabitants of the place. , 

When they were on board they were very merry 

and pleasant, and I treated them so much to their 

satisfaction that, in short, they were not well able to 

go on shore for that night, but were content to take 

[180] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

a nap on some carpets, which I caused to be spread 
for them ; and that the governor's son might think 
himself well used, I brought him a very good silk 
pightgown, with a crimson velvet cap, to lie down 
in, and in the morning desired him to accept of them 
for his use, which he took very kindly. 

During that merry evening one of the merchants, 
not so touched with drink as the young gentleman, 
nor so as not to mind what it was he came about, 
takes an occasion to withdraw out of the great cabin 
and enter into a parley with the master of the sloop 
in order to trade for what European goods we had 
on board. The master took the hint, and gave me 
notice of what had passed, and I gave him instruc- 
tions what to say and what to do ; according to which 
instructions they made but few words, bought the 
goods for about five thousand pieces of eight, and car- 
ried them away themselves, and at their own hazards. 

This was very agreeable to me, for now I began to 
see I should lick myself whole by the sale of this 
cargo, and should make myself full amends of Jack 
Spaniard for all the injuries he had done me in the 
first of these things. With this view I gave my 
master or captain of the sloop instructions for sale 
of all the rest of the goods, and left him to manage 
by himself, which he did so well that he sold the 
whole cargo the next day to the three Spaniards; 
with this additional circumstance, that they desired 
[181] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

the sloop might carry the goods, as they were on 
board, to such part of the terra firma as they should 
appoint between the Honduras and the coast of La 
Vera Cruz. 

It was difficult for me to make good this part of 
the bargain, but finding the price agreed for would 
very well answer the voyage, I consented. But then 
how to send the sloop away and remain among the 
Spaniards when I was now a clear man, this was a 
difficulty too, as it was also to go away, and not 
wait for a favourable answer from the viceroy of 
Mexico to the representation of the governor and 
the corregidore. However, at last I resolved to go 
in the sloop, fall out what would ; so I went to the 
governor and represented to him that, being now to 
expect a favourable answer from Mexico, it would be 
a great loss to me to keep the sloop there all the 
while, and I desired his leave for me to go with the 
sloop to Antigua to sell and dispose of the cargo, 
which he well knew I was obliged not to bring on 
shore there at the Havannah, and which would be 
in danger of being spoiled by lying so long on board. 
This I obtained readily, with license to come again 
into the road, and, for myself only, to come on 
shore in order to hear the viceroy's pleasure in my 
case, which was depending. 

Having thus obtained a license or passport for 
the sjoop and myself, I put to sea with the three 
[182] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

Spanish merchants on board with me. They told 
me they did not live at the Havannah, but it seems 
one of them did ; and some rich merchants of the 
Havannah, or of the parts thereabouts in the same 
island, were concerned with them, for they brought 
on board, that night we put to sea, a great sum of 
money in pieces of eight ; and, as I understood after- 
wards, that these merchants bought the cargo of me, 
and though they gave me a very great price for 
everything, yet that they sold them again to 
the merchants, who they procured on the coast 
of La Vera Cruz, at a prodigious advantage, so that 
they got above a hundred per cent, after I had 
gained very sufficiently before. 

We sailed from the Havannah directly for Vera 
Cruz. I scrupled venturing into the port at first, 
and was very uneasy lest I should have another 
Spanish trick put upon me ; but as we sailed under 
Spanish colours, they showed us such authentic 
papers from the proper officers that there was no 
room to fear anything. 

However, when we came in sight of the Spanish 
coast, I found they had a secret clandestine trade to 
carry on, which, though it was secret, yet they knew 
the way of it so well that it was but a mere road to 
them. The case was this : we stood in close under 
the shore in the night, about six leagues to the north 
of the port, where two of the three merchants went 
[183] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

on shore in the boat, and in three hours or there- 
abouts they came on board again with five canoes 
and seven or eight merchants more with them, and 
as soon as they were on board we stood off to sea, so 
that by daylight we were quite out of sight of land. 

I ought to have mentioned before that as soon as 
we were put to sea from the Havannah, and during 
our voyage into the Gulf of Mexico, which was 
eight days, we rummaged the whole cargo, and 
opening every bale as far as the Spanish merchants 
desired, we trafficked with them for the whole cargo, 
except the barrels of flour and pease. 

This cargo was considerable in itself, for my wife's 
account or invoice, drawn out by my tutor and 
manager, amounted to <£2684, 10s., and I sold the 
whole, including what had been sold in the evening, 
when they were on board first, as I have said, for 
thirty-eight thousand five hundred and ninety-three 
pieces of eight, and they allowed me twelve hundred 
pieces of eight for the freight of the sloop, and made 
my master and the seamen very handsome presents 
besides ; and they were well able to do this too, as 
you shall hear presently. 

After we were gotten out of sight of land the 
Spaniards fell to their traffic, and our three merchants 
opened their shop, as they might say, for it was 
their shop. As to me, I had nothing to do with it 
or with their goods. They drove their bargain in a 
[184] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

few hours, and at night we stood in again for the 
shore, when the five canoes carried a great part of 
the goods on shore, and brought the money back in 
specie, as well for that they carried as for all the rest, 
and at their second voyage carried all away clear, 
leaving me nothing on board but my barrels of flour 
and pease, which they bade me money for too, but 
not so much as I expected. 

Here I found that my Spanish merchants made 
above seventy thousand pieces of eight of the cargo 
I had sold them, upon which I had a great mind to 
be acquainted with those merchants on the terra 
firma, who were the last customers ; for it presently 
occurred to me that I could easily go with a sloop 
from Virginia, and taking a cargo directed on pur- 
pose from England of about «£5000 or «£6000, I 
might easily make four of one. With this view I 
began to make a kind of an acquaintance with the 
Spaniards which came in the canoes, and we became 
so intimate that at last, with the consent of the three 
Spaniards of the Havannah, I accepted an invitation 
on shore to their house, which was a little villa, or 
rather plantation, where they had an ingenio, that is 
to say, a sugar-house, or sugar-work, and there they 
treated us like princes. 

I took occasion at this invitation to say that, if I 
knew how to find my way thither again, I could visit 
them once or twice a year, very much to their ad- 
[186] 



THE LIFE OP COLONEL JACQUE 

vantage and mine too. One of the Spaniards took 
the hint, and taking me into a room by myself, 
" Seignior," says he, " if you have any thoughts of 
coming to this place again, I shall give you such 
directions as you shall be sure not to mistake ; and, 
upon either coming on shore in the night and coming 
up to this place, or upon making the signals which 
we shall give you, we will not fail to come off to you, 
and bring money enough for any cargaison" (so they 
call it) " that you shall bring." 

I took all their directions, took their paroles of 
honour for my safety, and, without taking any notice 
to my first three merchants, laid up the rest in my 
most secret thoughts, resolving to visit them again 
in as short a time as I could ; and thus having, in 
about five days, finished all our merchandising, we 
stood off to sea, and made for the island of Cuba, 
where I set my three Spaniards on shore with all 
their treasure, to their heart's content, and made the 
best of my way to Antigua, where, with all the de- 
spatch I could, I sold my two hundred barrels of flour, 
which, however, had suffered a little by the length 
of the voyage ; and having laden the sloop with 
rum, molasses, and sugar, I set sail again for the 
Havannah. 

I was now uneasy indeed, for fear of the pirates, 
for I was a rich ship, having, besides goods, near forty 
thousand pieces of eight in silver. 
[186] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

When I came back to the Havannah, I went on 
shore to wait on the governor and the corregidore, 
and to hear what return was had from the viceroy, 
and had the good fortune to know that the viceroy 
had disallowed that part of the sentence which con- 
demned us as prisoners and put a ransom on us, 
which he insisted could not be but in time of open 
war. But as to the confiscation, he deferred it to the 
Chamber or Council of Commerce at Seville, and the 
appeal to the king, if such be preferred. 

This was, in some measure, a very good piece of 
justice in the viceroy ; for, as we had not been on 
shore, we could not be legally imprisoned ; and for 
the rest, I believe if I would have given myself the 
trouble to have gone to Old Spain, and have pre- 
ferred my claim to both the ship and the cargo, I 
had recovered them also. 

However, as it was, I was now a freeman without 
ransom, and my men were also free, so that all the 
money which I had deposited, as above, was returned 
me ; and thus I took my leave of the Havannah, and 
made the best of my way for Virginia, where I ar- 
rived after a year and a half's absence ; and notwith- 
standing all my losses, came home above forty 
thousand pieces of eight richer than I went out. 

As to the old affair about the Preston prisoners, 
that was quite at an end, for the general pardon 
passed in Parliament made me perfectly easy, and I 
[187] 



THE LIFE OP COLONEL JACQUE 

took no more thought about that part I might 
here very usefully observe how necessary and insepar- 
able a companion fear is to guilt. It was but a few 
months before that the face of a poor Preston trans- 
port would have frighted me out of my wits ; to 
avoid them I feigned myself sick, and wrapped my 
legs in flannel, as if I had the gout ; whereas now 
they were no more surprise to me, nor was I any 
more uneasy to see them, than I was to see any other 
of the servants of the plantations. 

And that which was more particular than all was, 
that, though before I fancied every one of them 
would know me and remember me, and consequently 
betray and accuse me, now, though I was frequently 
among them, and saw most of them, if not all of 
them, one time or other, nay, though I remembered 
several of their faces, and even some of their names, 
yet there was not a man of them that ever took the 
least notice of me, or of having known or seen me 
before. 

It would have been a singular satisfaction to me if 
I could have known so much as this of them before, 
and have saved me all the fatigue, hazard, and mis- 
fortune that befell me afterwards ; but man, a short- 
sighted creature, sees so little before him that he can 
neither anticipate his joys nor prevent his disasters, 
be they ever so little a distance from him. 

I had now my head full of my West India proj- 
[188] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

ect, and I began to make provision for it accord- 
ingly. I had a full account of what European goods 
were most acceptable in New Spain ; and, to add to 
my speed, I knew that the Spaniards were in great 
want of European goods, the galleons from Old 
Spain having been delayed to an unusual length of 
time for the two years before. Upon this account, 
not having time, as I thought, to send to England 
for a cargo of such goods as were most proper, I 
resolved to load my sloop with tobacco and rum, 
the last I brought from Antigua, and go away to 
Boston in New England, and to New York, and see 
if I could pick up a cargo to my mind. 

Accordingly, I took twenty thousand pieces of 
eight in money, and my sloop laden as above, 
and taking my wife with me, we went away. It 
was an odd and new thing at New England to 
have such a quantity of goods bought up there by 
a sloop from Virginia, and especially to be paid for 
in ready money, as I did for most of my goods; 
and this set all the trading heads upon the stretch, 
to inquire what and who I was ; to which they had 
an immediate and direct answer, that I was a very 
considerable planter in Virginia, and that was all 
any of my men on board the sloop could tell of me, 
and enough too. 

Well, it was the cause of much speculation among 
them, as I heard at second and third hands. Some 
[189] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

said, " He is certainly going to Jamaica ; " others 
said, "He is going to trade with the Spaniards ; w 
others that " He is going to the South Sea and turn 
half merchant, half pirate, on the coast of Chili and 
Peru ; " some one thing, some another, as the men 
gossips found their imaginations directed; but we 
went on with our business, and laid out twelve 
thousand pieces of eight, besides our cargo of rum 
and tobacco, and went from thence to New York, 
where we laid out the rest. 

The chief of the cargo we bought here was fine 
English broadcloth, serges, druggets, Norwich stuffs, 
bays, says, and all kinds of woollen manufactures, as 
also linen of all sorts, a very great quantity, and near 
i?1000 in fine silks of several sorts. Being thus 
freighted, I came back safe to. Virginia, and with very 
little addition to my cargo, began to prepare for my 
West IdBia voyage. 

I should have mentioned that I had built upon 
my sloop and raised her a little, so that I had made 
her carry twelve guns, and fitted her up for defence ; 
for I thought she should not be attacked and boarded 
by a few Spanish barco tangos, as she was before; 
and I found the benefit of it afterwards, as you shall 
hear. 

We set sail the beginning of August, and as I had 
twice been attacked by pirates in passing the Gulf 
of Florida, or among the Bahama Islands, I resolved, 
[190] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

though it was farther about, to stand off to sea, and 
so keep, as I believed it would be, out of the way of 
them. 

We passed the tropic, as near as we could guess, 
just where the famous Sir William Phipps fished up 
the silver from the Spanish plate wreck, and, stand- 
ing in between the islands, kept our course W. by S., 
keeping under the isle of Cuba, and so running away, 
trade, as they call it, into the great Gulf of Mexico, 
leaving the island of Jamaica to the S. and S.E., by 
this means avoiding, as I thought, all the Spaniards 
of Cuba or the Havannah. 

As we passed the west point of Cuba three Spanish 
boats came off to board us, as they had done before, 
on the other side of the island. But they found 
themselves mistaken; we were too many for them, 
for we run out our guns, which they did not perceive 
before, and firing three or four shots at them, they 
retired. 

The next morning they appeared again, being five 
large boats and a barque, and gave us chase ; but we 
then spread our Spanish colours, and brought to to 
fight them, at which they retired ; so we escaped this 
danger by the addition of force which we had made 
to our vessel. 

We now had a fair run for our port, and as I had 
taken very good directions, I stood away to the north 
of St. John d'Ulva, and then running in for the 
[191] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

shore, found the place appointed exactly ; and going 
on shore, I sent the master of my sloop directly to 
the ingenio, where he found the Spanish merchant 
at his house, and where he dwelt like a sovereign 
prince, who welcomed him, and understanding that 
I was in a particular boat at the creek, as appointed, 
he came immediately with him, and bringing another 
Spaniard from- a villa not far off, in about four hours 
they were with me. 

They would have persuaded me to go up to their 
houses and have stayed there till the next night, 
ordering the sloop to stand off as usual, but I would 
not consent to let the sloop go to sea without me, so 
we went on board directly, and, as the night was 
almost run, stood off to sea ; so by daybreak we were 
quite out of sight of land. 

Here we began, as I said before, to open shop, 
and I found the Spaniards were extremely surprised 
at seeing such a cargo — I mean so large ; for, in 
short, they had cared not if it had been four times 
as much. They soon ran through the contents of 
all the bales we opened that night, and, with very 
little dispute about the price, they approved and 
accepted all that I showed them ; but as they said 
they had not money for any greater parcel, they 
agreed to go on shore the next evening for more 
money. 

However, we spent the remainder of the night in 
[192] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

looking over and making inventories or invoices of 
the rest of the cargo, that so they might see the 
goods, know the value, and know what more money 
they had to bring. 

Accordingly, in the evening we stood in for the 
shore, and they carried part of the cargo with them, 
borrowing the sloop's boat to assist them ; and after 
they had lodged and landed the goods they came 
on board again, bringing three of the other mer- 
chants with them who were concerned before, and 
money enough to clear the whole ship — ay, and 
ship and all, if I had been willing to sell her. 

To give them their due, they dealt with me like 
men of honour. They were indeed sensible that 
they bought everything much cheaper of me than 
they did before of the three merchants of the 
Havannah, these merchants having been, as it were, 
the hucksters, and bought them first of me, and then 
advanced, as I have said, above one hundred per 
cent, upon the price they gave me. But yet, at 
the same time, I advanced in the price much more 
now than I did before to the said Spaniards ; nor 
was it without reason, because of the length and risk 
of the voyage, both out and home, which now lay 
wholly upon me. 

In short, I sold the whole cargo to them, and for 
which I received near two hundred thousand pieces 
of eight in money ; besides which, when they came 

TOLH.- 13 [193] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

on board the second time, they brought all their 
boats loaden with fresh provisions, hogs, sheep, 
fowls, sweetmeats, &&, enough for my whole voyage, 
all which they made a present of to me. And thus 
we finished our traffic to our mutual satisfaction, and 
parted with promises of further commerce, and with 
assurances on their part of all acts of friendship and 
assistance that I could desire if any disaster should 
befall me in any of these adventures — as indeed 
was not improbable, considering the strictness and 
severity of their customs in case any people were 
trading upon their coast. 

I immediately called a council with my little crew 
which way we should go back. The mate was for 
beating it up to windward and getting up to 
Jamaica ; but as we were too rich to run any risks, 
and were to take the best course to get safe home, I 
thought, and so did the master of the sloop, that 
our best way was to coast about the bay, and, keep- 
ing the shore of Florida on board, make the shortest 
course to the gulf, and so make for the coast of 
Carolina, and to put in there into the first port we 
could, and wait for any English men-of-war that 
might be on the coast to secure us to the capes. 

This was the best course we could take, and proved 

very safe to us, excepting that, about the cape of 

Florida, and on the coast in the gulf, till we came 

to the height of St. Augustine, we were several 

[194] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

times visited with the Spaniards" barco longos and 
small barks, in hopes of making a prize of us ; but 
carrying Spanish colours deceived most of them, 
and a good tier of guns kept the rest at a distance, 
so that we came safe, though once or twice in dan- 
ger of being run on shore by a storm of wind — 
I say, we came safe into Charles River in Carolina. 

From hence I found means to send a letter home, 
with an account to my wife of my good success ; and 
having an account that the coast was clear of pirates, 
though there were no men-of-war in the place, I ven- 
tured forward, and, in short, got safe into the Bay 
of Chesapeake, that is to say, within the capes of 
Virginia, and in a few days more to my own house, 
having been absent three months and four days. 

Never did any vessel on this side the world make a 
better voyage in so short a time that I made in this 
sloop ; for by the most moderate computation I 
cleared in these three months £25,000 sterling in 
ready money, all the charges of the voyages to New 
England also being reckoned up. 

Now was my time to have sat still, contented with 
what I had got, if it was in the power of man to 
know when his good fortune was at the highest. 
And more, my prudent wife gave it as her opinion 
that I should sit down satisfied and push the affair 
no farther, and earnestly persuaded me to do so. 
But I, that had a door open, as I thought, to im- 
[195] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

mense treasure, that had found the way to have a 
stream of the golden rivers of Mexico flow into my 
plantation of Virginia, and saw no hazards more 
than what were common to all such things in the 
prosecution — I say, to me these things looked with 
another face, and I dreamed of nothing but millions 
and hundreds of thousands ; so, contrary to all 
moderate measures, I pushed on for another voyage, 
and laid up a stock of all sorts of goods that I could 
get together proper for the trade. I did not indeed 
go again to New England, for I had by this time 
a very good cargo come from England pursuant to a 
commission I had sent several months before; so 
that, in short, my cargo, according to the invoice 
now made out, amounted to above £ 10,000 sterling 
first cost, and was a cargo so sorted and so well 
bought that I expected to have advanced upon 
them much more in proportion than I had done in 
the cargo before. 

.With these expectations we began our second 
voyage in April, being about five months after our 
return from the first. We had not indeed the same 
good speed, even in our beginning, as we had at 
first ; for though we stood off to sea about sixty 
leagues in order to be out of the way of the pirates, 
yet we had not been above five days at sea but we 
were visited and rifled by two pirate barks, who, 
being bound to the northward, that is to sav, the 
[196] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

banks of Newfoundland, took away all our provisions 
and all our ammunition and small arms, and left 
us very ill provided to pursue our voyage; and it 
being so near home, we thought it advisable to come 
about and stand in for the capes again, to restore 
our condition and furnish ourselves with stores of 
all kinds for our voyage. This took us up about 
ten days, and we put to sea again. As for our caigo, 
the pirates did not meddle with it, being all bale 
goods, which they had no present use for, and knew 
not what to do with if they had them. 

We met with no other adventure worth naming 
till, by the same course that we had steered before, 
we came into the Gulf of Mexico ; and the first mis- 
fortune we met with here was, that, on the back of 
Cuba, crossing towards the point of the terra jirma, 
on the coast of Yucatan, we had sight of the flota 
of New Spain, that is, of the ships which come from 
Carthagena or Porto Bello, and go to the Havan- 
nah, in order to pursue their voyage to Europe. 

They had with them one Spanish man-of-war and 
three frigates. Two of the frigates gave us chase ; 
but, it being just at the shutting in of the day, we 
soon lost sight of them, and standing to the north, 
across the Bay of Mexico, as if we were going to the 
mouth of Mississippi, they lost us quite, and in a 
few days more we made the bottom of the bay, being 
the port we were bound for. 
[197] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

We stood in as usual in the night, and gave notice 
to our friends ; but instead of their former readiness 
to come on board, they gave us notice that we had 
been seen in the bay, and that notice of us was given 
at Vera Cruz and at other places, and that several 
frigates were in quest of us, and that three more 
would be cruising the next morning in search for us. 
We could not conceive how this could be ; but we 
were afterwards told that those three frigates, hav- 
ing lost sight of us in the night, had made in for 
the shore, and had given the alarm of us as of 
privateers. 

Be that as it would, we had nothing to do but to 
consider what course to take immediately. The 
Spanish merchants' 1 advice was very good if we had 
taken it, namely, to have unladen as many of our 
bales as we could that very night by the help of 
our boat and their canoes, and to make the best of 
our way in the morning to the north of the gulf, 
and take our fate. 

This my skipper or master thought very well of, 
but when we began to put it into execution, we were 
so confused and in such a hurry, being not resolved 
what course to take, that we could not get out above 
sixteen bales of all sorts of goods before it began to 
be too light and it behoved us to sail. At last the 
master proposed a medium, which was, that I should 
go on shore in the next boat, in which were five 
[198] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

bales of goods more, and that I should stay on 
shore if the Spanish merchants would undertake to 
conceal me, and let them go to sea and take their 
chance. 

The Spanish merchants readily undertook to pro- 
tect me, especially it being so easy to have me pass 
for a natural Spaniard, and so they took me on shore 
with twenty-one bales of my goods, and the sloop 
stood off to sea. If they met with any enemies they 
were to stand in for the shore the next night ; and 
we failed not to look well out for them, but to no 
purpose, for the next day they were discovered and 
chased by two Spanish frigates. They stood from 
them, and the sloop, being an excellent sailer, gained 
so much that they would certainly have been clear 
of them when night came on, but a small picaroon 
of a sloop kept them company in spite of all they 
could do, and two or three times offered to engage 
them, thereby to give time to the rest to come up ; 
but the sloop kept her way, and gave them a chase 
of three days and nights, having a fresh gale of 
wind at S.W., till she made the Rio Grand, or, as 
the French call it, the Mississippi, and there finding 
no remedy, they ran the vessel on shore not far 
from the fort which the Spaniards call Pensacola, 
garrisoned at that time with French. Our men 
would have .entered the river as a port, but having 
no pilot, and the current of the river being strong 
[199] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

against them, the sloop ran on shore, and the men 
shifted as well as they could in their boats, 

I was now in a very odd condition indeed. My 
circumstances were in one sense, indeed, very happy 
— namely, that I was in the hands of my friends, for 
such really they were, and so faithful that no men 
could have been more careful of their own safety than 
were they of mine; and that which added to the 
comfort of my new condition was the produce of 
my goods, which were gotten on shore by their own 
advice and direction, which was a fund sufficient to 
maintain me with them as long as I could be sup- 
posed to stay there ; and if not, the first merchant 
to whose house I went assured me that he would give 
me credit for twenty thousand pieces of eight if I had 
occasion for it. 

My greatest affliction was, that I knew not how to 
convey news to my wife of my present condition, and 
how, among many misfortunes of the voyage, I was 
yet safe and in good hands. 

But there was no remedy for this part but the 
great universal cure of all incurable sorrows, viz., 
patience ; and, indeed, I had a great deal of reason, 
not for patience only, but thankfulness, if I had 
known the circumstances which I should have been 
reduced to if I had fallen into the hands of the 
Spaniards ; the best of which that I could reason- 
ably have expected had been to have been sent to 

[aoo] 



THE LIFE OP COLONEL JACQUE 

the mines, or, which was ten thousand times worse, 
the Inquisition ; or, if I had escaped the Spaniards, 
as my men in the sloop did, the hardships they were 
exposed to, the dangers they were in, and the mis- 
eries they suffered were still worse in wandering 
among savages, and the more savage French, who 
plundered and stripped them, instead of relieving 
and supplying them in their long wilderness journey 
over the mountains till they reached the S.W. parts 
of South Carolina, a journey which, indeed, deserves 
to have an account to be given of it by itself. I say, 
all these things, had I known of them, would have 
let me see that I had a great deal of reason, not only 
to be patient under my present circumstances, but 
satisfied and thankful 

Here, as I said, my patron, the merchant, enter- 
tained me like a prince; he made my safety his 
peculiar care, and while we were in any expectation 
of the sloop being taken and brought into Vera 
Cruz, he kept me retired at a little house in a wood, 
where he kept a fine aviary of all sorts of American 
birds, and out of which he yearly sent some as 
presents to his friends in Old Spain. 

This retreat was necessary lest, if the sloop should 
be taken and brought into Vera Cruz, and the men 
be brought in prisoners, they should be tempted to 
give an account of me as their supercargo or mer- 
chant, and where both I and the twenty-one bales 
[«01] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

of goods were set on shore. As for the goods, he 
made sure work with them, for they were all opened, 
taken out of the bales, and separated, and, being 
mixed with other European goods which came by 
the galleons, were made up in new package, and 
sent to Mexico in several parcels, some to one mer- 
chant, some to another, so that it was impossible to 
have found them out, even if they had had informa- 
tion of them. 

In this posture, and in apprehension of some bad 
news of the sloop, I remained at the villa, or house 
in the vale — for so they called it — about five 
weeks. I had two negroes appointed to wait on me, 
one of which was my purveyor, or my cook, the 
other my valet ; and my friend, the master, of all, 
came constantly every evening to visit and sup with 
me, when we walked out together into the aviary, 
which was, of its kind, the most beautiful thing that 
ever I saw in the world. 

After above five weeks 4 retreat of this kind, he had 
good intelligence of the fate of the sloop, viz., that 
the two frigates and a sloop had chased her till she 
ran on ground near the fort of Pensacola ; that they 
saw her stranded and broke in pieces by the force 
of the waves, the men making their escape in their 
boat. This news was brought, it seems, by the said 
frigates to La Vera Cruz, where my friend went on 
purpose to be fully informed, and received the ao- 
[202] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

count from one of the captains of the frigates, and 
discoursed with him at large about it. 

I was better pleased with the loss of the sloop and 
all my cargo, the men being got on shore and escap- 
ing, than I should have been with the saving the 
whole cargo, if the men had fallen into the hands of 
the Spaniards ; for now I was safe, whereas then, it be- 
ing supposed they would have been forced to some dis- 
covery about me, I must have fled, and should have 
found it very difficult to have made my escape, even 
with all that my friends could have done for me too. 

But now I was perfectly easy, and my friend, who 
thought confining me at the house in the vale no 
longer needful, brought me publicly home to his 
dwelling-house, as a merchant come from Old Spain 
by the last galleons, and who, having been at Mexico, 
was come to reside with him. 

Here I was dressed like a Spaniard of the better 
sort, had three negroes to attend me, and was called 
Don Ferdinand de Villa Moresa, in Castilia Feja — 
that is to say, in Old Castile. 

Here I had nothing to do but to walk about and 
ride out into the woods, and oome home again to 
enjoy the pleasantest and most agreeable retirement 
in the world ; for certainly no men in the world live 
in such splendour and wallow in such immense trea- 
sures as the merchants of this place. 

They live, as I have said, in a kind of country 
[808] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

retreat at their villas, or, as we would call' them in 
Virginia, their plantations, and, as they do call them, 
their ingemoe, where they make their indigp and 
their sugars. But they have also houses and ware- 
houses at Vera Cruz, where they go twice a year, 
when the galleons arrive from Old Spain, and when 
those galleons re-lade for their return. And it was 
surprising to me, when I went to La Vera Cruz with 
them, to see what prodigious consignments they had 
from their correspondents in Old Spain, and with 
what despatch they managed them ; for no sooner 
were the cases, packs, and bales of European goods 
brought into their warehouses but they were opened 
and repacked by porters and packers of their own — 
that is to say, negroes and Indian servants — and 
being made up into new bales and separate parcels, 
were all despatched again by horses for Mexico, and 
directed to their several merchants there, and the re- 
mainder carried home, as above, to the ingtnio where 
they lived, which was near thirty English miles from 
Vera Cruz, so that in about twenty days their ware- 
houses were again entirely free. At La Vera Cruz, 
all their business was over there, and they and all 
their servants retired; for they stayed no longer 
there than needs must, because of the unhealthiness 
of the air. 

After the goods were thus despatched, it was 
equally surprising to see how soon, and with what 
[204] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

exactness, the merchants of Mexico to whom those 
cargoes were separately consigned made the return, 
and how it came all in silver or in gold, so that their 
warehouses in a few months were piled up, even to 
the ceiling, with chests of pieces of eight and with 
bars of silver. 

It is impossible to describe in the narrow compass 
of this work with what exactness and order, and yet 
with how little hurry, and not the least confusion, 
everything was done, and how soon a weight of busi- 
ness of such importance and value was negotiated 
and finished, the goods repacked, invoices made, and 
everything despatched and gone; so that in about 
five weeks all the goods they had received from 
Europe by the galleons were disposed of and entered 
in their journals to the proper account of their mer- 
chant to whom they were respectively consigned; 
from thence they had book-keepers who drew out 
the invoices and wrote the letters, which the mer- 
chant himself only read over and signed, and then 
other hands copied all again into other books. 

I can give no estimate of the value of the several 
consignments they received by that flota ; but I re- 
member that, when the galleons went back, they 
shipped on board, at several times, one million three 
hundred thousand pieces of eight in specie, besides a 
hundred and eighty bales or bags of cochineal and 
about three hundred bales of indigo ; but they were 
[205] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

so modest that they said this was for themselves and 
their friends. That is to say, the several merchants 
of Mexico consigned large quantities of bullion to 
them, to ship on board and consign according to 
their order ; but then I know also that, for all that, 
they were allowed commission, so that their gain was 
very considerable even that way also. 

I had been with them at La Vera Cruz, and came 
back again before we came to an account for the 
goods which I had brought on shore in the twenty- 
one bales, which, by the account we brought them to 
(leaving a piece of everything to be governed by our 
last market), amounted to eight thousand five hun- 
dred and seventy pieces of eight, all which money 
my friend — for so I must now call him — brought 
me in specie, and caused his negroes to pile them up 
in one corner of my apartment ; so that I was indeed 
still very rich, all things considered. 

There was a bale which I had caused to be packed 
up on purpose in Virginia, and which indeed I had 
written for from England, being chiefly of fine Eng- 
lish broadcloths, silk, silk druggets, and fine stuffs 
of several kinds, with some very fine hollands, which 
I set apart for presents, as I should find occasion ; 
and as, whatever hurry I was in at carrying the 
twenty-one bales of goods on shore, I did not forget 
to let this bale be one of them, so, when we came to 
a sale for the rest, I told them that this was a pack 
[206] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

with clothes and necessaries for my own wearing and 
use, and so desired it might not be opened with the 
rest, which was accordingly observed, and that bale 
or pack was brought into my apartment. 

This bale was, in general, made up of several 
smaller bales, which I had directed, so that I might 
have room to make presents, equally sorted as the 
circumstance might direct me. However, they were 
all considerable, and I reckoned the whole bale cost 
me near £900 sterling in England ; and though my 
present circumstances required some limits to my 
bounty in making presents, yet the obligation I was 
under being so much the greater, especially to this 
one friendly, generous Spaniard, I thought I could 
not do better than, by opening two of the smaller 
bales, join them together, and make my gift some- 
thing suitable to the benefactor, and to the respect 
he had shown me. Accordingly, I took two bales, 
and, laying the goods together, the contents were as 
follows : — 

Two pieces of fine English broadcloth, the finest that 
could be got in London, divided, as was that which I 
gave to the governor at the Havannah, into fine crim- 
son in grain, fine light mixtures, and fine black. 

Four pieces of fine holland, of 7s. to 8s. per ell in 
London. 

Twelve pieces of fine silk drugget and duroys, for 
men's wear. 

[«07] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

Six pieces of broad silks, two damasks, two brocaded 
silks, and two mantuas. 

With a box of ribands and a box of lace ; the last cost 
about £40 sterling in England. 

This handsome parcel I laid open in my apart- 
ment, and brought him upstairs one morning, on 
pretence to drink chocolate with me, which he or- 
dinarily did ; when, as we drank chocolate and was 
merry, I said to him, though I had sold him almost 
all my cargo and taken his money, yet the truth was, 
that I ought not to have sold them to him, but to 
have laid them all at his feet, for that it was to his 
direction I owed the having anything saved at all. 

He smiled, and, with a great deal of friendship in 
his face, told me that not to have paid me for them 
would have been to have plundered a shipwreck, 
which had been worse than to have robbed an 
hospital. 

At last I told him I had two requests to make to 
him, which must not be denied. I told him I had a 
small present to make him, which I would give him 
a reason why he should not refuse to accept; and 
the second request I would make after the first was 
granted. He said he would have accepted my pres- 
ent from me if I had not been under a disaster, but 
as it was it would be cruel and ungenerous. But I 
told him he was obliged to hear my reason for his 
accepting it. Then I told him that this parcel was 
[208] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

made up for him by name by my wife and I in 
Virginia, and his name set on the marks of the bale, 
and accordingly I showed him the marks, which was 
indeed on one of the bales, but I had doubled it 
now, as above, so that I told him these were his own 
proper goods ; and, in short, I pressed him so to re- 
ceive them that he made a bow ; and I said no more, 
but ordered my negro, that is to say, his negro 
that waited on me, to carry them all, except the 
two boxes, into his apartments, but would not let 
him see the particulars till they were all carried 
away. 

After he was gone about a quarter of an hour, he 
came in raving and almost swearing, and in a great 
passion, but I could easily see he was exceedingly 
pleased ; and told me, had he known the particulars, 
he would never have suffered them to have gone as 
he did, and at last used the very same compliment 
that the governor at the Havannah used, viz., that 
it was a present fit for a viceroy of Mexico rather 
than for him. 

When he had done, he then told me he remem- 
bered I had two requests to him, and that one was 
not to be told till after the first was granted, and he 
hoped now I had something to ask of him that was 
equal to the obligation I laid upon him. 

I told him I knew it was not the custom in Spain 
for a stranger to make presents to the ladies, and 
voi.ii. — 14 [209] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

that I would not in the least doubt but that, what- 
ever the ladies of his family required as proper for 
their use, he would appropriate to them as he thought 
fit; but that there were two little boxes in the par- 
cel which my wife with her own hand had directed 
to the ladies; and I begged he would be pleased 
with his own hand to give them in my wife's name, 
as directed ; that I was only the messenger, but that 
I could not be honest if I did not discharge myself 
of the trust reposed in me. 

These were the two boxes of ribands and lace, 
which, knowing the nicety of the ladies in Spain, or 
rather of the Spaniards about their women, I had 
made my wife pack up, and directed with her own 
hand, as I have said. 

He smiled, and told me it was true the Spaniards 
did not ordinarily admit so much freedom among the 
women as other nations ; but he hoped, he said, I 
would not think the Spaniards thought all their 
women whores, or that all Spaniards were jealous of 
their wives ; that, as to my present, since he had 
agreed to accept of it, I should have the direction of 
what part I pleased to his wife and daughters ; for 
he had three daughters. 

Here I strained courtesies again, and told him by 
no means ; I would direct nothing of that kind. I 
only begged that he would with his own hand pre- 
sent to his donna, or lady, the present designed her 
[210] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

by my wife, and that he would present it in her 
name, now living in Virginia. He was extremely 
pleased with the nicety I used ; and I saw him pre- 
sent it to her accordingly, and could see, at the open- 
ing of it, that she was extremely pleased with the 
present itself, as indeed might very well be, for in 
that country it was worth a very considerable sum 
of money. 

Though I was used with an uncommon friendship 
before, and nothing could well be desired more, 
yet the grateful sense I showed of it in the mag- 
nificence of this present was not lost, and the whole 
family appeared sensible of it ; so that I must allow 
that presents, where they can be made in such a 
manner, are not without their influence, where the 
persons were not at all mercenary either before or 
after. 

I had here now a most happy and comfortable re- 
treat, though it was a kind of an exile. Here I en- 
joyed everything I could think of that was agreeable 
and pleasant, except only a liberty of going home, 
which, for that reason perhaps, was the only thing I 
desired in the world ; for the grief of one absent 
comfort is oftentimes capable of embittering all the 
other enjoyments in the world. 

Here I enjoyed the moments which I had never 
before known how to employ — I mean that here I 
learned to look back upon a long ill-spent life, 
[211] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

blessed with infinite advantage, which I had no heart 
given me till now to make use of, and here I found 
just reflections were the utmost felicity of human 
life. 

Here I wrote these memoirs, having to add to 
the pleasure of looking back with due reflections 
the benefit of a violent fit of the gout, which, 
as it is allowed by most people,- clears the head, 
restores the memory, and qualifies us to make the 
most, and just, and useful remarks upon our own 
actions. 

Perhaps when I wrote these things down I did not 
foresee that the writings of our own stories would 
be so much the fashion in England, or so agreeable 
to others to read, as I find custom and the humour 
of the times has caused it to be. If any one that 
reads my story pleases to make the same just reflec- 
tions which I acknowledge I ought to have made, he 
will reap the benefit of my misfortunes perhaps more 
than I have done myself. T is evident by the long 
series of changes and turns which have appeared in 
the narrow compass of one private, mean person's 
life, that the* history of men's lives may be many 
ways made useful and instructing to those who read 
them, if moral and religious improvement and re- 
flections are made by those that write them. 

There remains many things in the course of this 
unhappy life of mine, though I have left so little a 
[ 212 ] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

part of it to speak of, that is worth giving a large 
and distinct account of, and which gives room for 
just reflections of a kind which I have not made yet. 
Particularly, I think it just to add how, in collecting 
the various changes and turns in my affairs, I saw 
clearer than ever I had done before how an invincible 
overruling Power, a hand influenced from above, 
governs all our actions of every kind, limits all our 
designs, and orders the events of everything relating 
to us. 

And from this observation it necessarily occurred 
to me how just it was that we should pay the homage 
of all events to Him ; that as He guided, and had 
even made the chain of cause and consequences, which 
nature in general strictly obeyed, so to Him should 
be given the honour of all events, the consequences 
of those causes, as the first Mover and Maker of all 
things. 

I, who had hitherto lived, as might be truly said, 
without God in the world, began now to see farther 
into all those things than I had ever yet been capable 
of before, and this brought me at last to look with 
shame and blushes upon such a course of wickedness 
as I had gone through in the world. I had been 
bred, indeed, to nothing of either religious or moral 
knowledge. What I gained of either was, first, by 
the little time of civil life which I lived in Scotland, 
where my abhorrence of the wickedness of my capt*ip 
[813] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUB 

and comrade, and some sober, religious company I 
fell into, first gave me some knowledge of good and 
evil, and showed me the beauty of a sober, religious 
life, though, with my leaving that country, it soon 
left me too ; or, secondly, the modest hints and just 
reflections of my steward, whom I called my tutor, 
who was a man of sincere religion, good principles, 
and a real, tine penitent for his past miscarriages. 
Oh! had I with him sincerely repented of what 
was past, I had not for twenty-four years together 
lived a life of levity and profligate wickedness 
after it 

But here I had, as I said, leisure to reflect and to 
repent, to call to mind things past, and, with a just 
detestation, learn, as Job says, to abhor myself in 
dust and ashes. 

It is with this temper that I have written my 
story. I would have all that design to read it pre- 
pare to do so with the temper qf penitents, and re- 
member with how much advantage they may make 
their penitent reflections at home, under the merciful 
dispositions of Providence, in peace, plenty, and 
ease, rather than abroad, under the discipline of a 
transported criminal, as my wife and my tutor, or 
under the miseries and distresses of a shipwrecked 
wanderer, as my skipper or captain of the sloop, 
who, as I hear, died a very great penitent, labouring 
in tbs deserts and mountains to find his way home 
[214] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

to Virginia, by the way of Carolina, whither the rest 
of the crew reached after infinite dangers and hard- 
ships; or in exile, however favourably circumstanced, 
as mine, in absence from my family, and for some 
time in no probable view of ever seeing them any 
more. 

Such, I say, may repent with advantage; but 
how few are they that seriously look in till their 
way is hedged up and they have no other way to 
look! 

Here, I say, I had leisure to repent. How far it 
pleases God to give the grace of repentance where 
He gives the opportunity of it is not for me to say 
of myself. It is sufficient that I recommend it to 
all that read this story, that, when they find their 
lives come up in any degree to any similitude of 
cases, they will inquire by me, and ask themselves, 
Is not this the time to repent ? Perhaps the answer 
may touch them. 

I have only to add to what was then written, that 
my kind friends the Spaniards, finding no other 
method presented for conveying me to my home — 
that is to say, to Virginia — got a license for me to 
come in the next galleons, as a Spanish merchant, 
to Cadiz, where I arrived safe with all my treasure ; 
for he suffered me to be at no expenses in his house ; 
and from Cadiz I soon got my passage on board an 
English merchantship for London, from whence I 
[215] 



THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE 

sent an account of my adventures to my wife, and 
where, in about five months more, she came over to 
me, leaving with full satisfaction the management 
of all our affairs in Virginia in the same faithful 
hands as before.

THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 



AN EXPLANATORY PREFACE 

IT is not that I see any reason to alter my 
opinion in anything I have written which 
occasions this epistle, but I find it necessary, 
for the satisfaction of some persons of honour 
as well as wit, to pass a short explication upon it, 
and tell the world what I mean, or rather what I do 
not mean, in some things wherein I find I am liable 
to be misunderstood. 

I confess myself something surprised to hear that 
I am taxed with bewraying my own nest and abus- 
ing our nation by discovering the meanness of our 
original, in order to make the English contemptible 
abroad and at home ; in which I think they are mis- 
taken. For why should not our neighbours be as 
good as we to derive from ? And I must add that, 
had we been an unmixed nation, I am of opinion 
it had been to our disadvantage. For, to go no 
further, we have three nations about us as clear from 
mixtures of blood as any in the world, and I know 
not which of them I could wish ourselves to be like 
— I mean the Scots, the Welsh, and Irish ; and if I 
were to write a reverse to the satire, I would ex- 
[219] 



AN EXPLANATORY PREFACE 

amine all the nations of Europe, and prove that 
those nations which are most mixed are the best, 
and have least of barbarism and brutality among 
them ; and abundance of reasons might be given for 
it, too long to bring into a preface. 

But I give this hint to let the world know that I 
am far from thinking it is a satire upon the English 
nation to tell them they are derived from all the 
nations under heaven — that is, from several nations. 
Nor is it meant to undervalue the original of the 
English, for we see no reason to like them the worse, 
being the relics of Nomans, Danes, Saxons, and 
Normans, than we should have done if they had 
remained Britons; that is, than if they had been 
all Welshmen. 

But the intent of the satire is pointed at the 
vanity of those who talk of their antiquity and value 
themselves upon their, pedigree, their ancient fami- 
lies, and being true-born ; whereas it is impossible 
we should be true-born, and if we could, should have 
lost by the bargain. 

Those sort of people who call themselves true- 
born and tell long stories of their families, and, like 
a nobleman of Venice, think a foreigner ought not 
to walk on the same side of the street with them, 
are owned to be meant in this satire. What they 
would infer from their own original I know not, nor 
is it easy to make out whether they are the better 
[220] 



AN EXPLANATORY PREFACE 

or the worse for their ancestors. Our English nation 
may value themselves for their wit, wealth, and 
courage, and I believe few will dispute it with them ; 
but for long originals and ancient true-born families 
of English, I would advise them to waive the dis- 
course. A true Englishman is one that deserves a 
character, and I have nowhere lessened him that I 
know of; but as for a true-born Englishman, I con- 
fess I do not understand him. 

From hence I only infer that an Englishman, of 
all men, ought not to despise foreigners as such, and 
I think the inference is just, since what they are 
to-day we were yesterday, and to-morrow they will 
be like us. If foreigners misbehave in their several 
stations and employments, I have nothing to do 
with that ; the laws are open to punish them equally 
with natives, and let them have no favour. 

But when I see the town full of lampoons and 
invectives against Dutchmen only because they are 
foreigners, and the King reproached and insulted 
by insolent pedants and ballad-making poets for 
employing foreigners, and for being a foreigner him- 
self, I confess myself moved by it to remind our 
nation of their own original, thereby to let them see 
what a banter is put upon ourselves in it, since, 
speaking of Englishmen ab origine, we are really 
foreigners ourselves. 

I could go on to prove it is also impolitic in us to 
[221 ] 



AN EXPLANATORY PREFACE 

discourage foreigners, since it is easy to make it 
appear that the multitudes of foreign nations who 
have taken sanctuary here have been the greatest 
additions to the wealth and strength of the nation, 
the great essential whereof is the number of its in- 
habitants. Nor would this nation have ever arrived 
to the degree of wealth and glory it now boasts of if 
the addition of foreign nations, both as to manu- 
factures and arms, had not been helpful to it. This 
is so plain that he who is ignorant of it is too dull 
to be talked with. 

The satire, therefore, I must allow to be just till 
I am otherwise convinced, because nothing can be 
more ridiculous than to hear our people boast of 
that antiquity which, if it had been true, would 
have left us in so much worse a condition than we 
are in now; whereas we ought rather to boast 
among our neighbours that we are a part of them- 
selves, or the same original as they, but bettered by 
our climate, and, like our language and manufact- 
ures, derived from them and improved by us to a 
perfection greater than they can pretend to. 

This we might have valued ourselves upon without 
vanity ; but to disown our descent from them, talk- 
ing big of our ancient families and long originals, 
and stand at a distance from foreigners, like the 
enthusiast in religion, with a " Stand off; I am more 
holy than thou ! " — this is a thing so ridiculous in 
[222] 



AN EXPLANATORY PREFACE 

a nation, derived from foreigners as we are, that I 
could not but attack them as I have done. 

And whereas I am threatened to be called to a 
public account for this freedom, and the publisher 
of this has been new-papered in gaol already for it, 
though I see nothing in it for which the Govern- 
ment can be displeased, yet if at the same time those 
people who, with an unlimited arrogance in print, 
every day affront the King, prescribe the Parliament, 
and lampoon the Government may be either pun- 
ished or restrained, I am content to stand and fall 
with the public justice of my native country which 
I am not sensible I have anywhere injured. 

Nor would I be misunderstood concerning the 
clergy, with whom, if I have taken any license more 
than becomes a satire, I question not but those 
gentlemen, who are men of letters, are also men of 
so much candour as to allow me a loose at the 
crimes of the guilty without thinking the whole 
profession lashed, who are innocent. I profess to 
have very mean thoughts of those gentlemen who 
have deserted their own principles, and exposed even 
their morals aa well as loyalty, but not at all to 
think it affects any but such as are concerned in the 
fact. 

Nor would I be misrepresented as to the ingrati- 
tude of the English to the King and his friends, as 
if I meant the English as a nation are so. The con-

AN EXPLANATORY PREFACE 

trary is so apparent, that I would hope it should 
not be suggested of me ; and, therefore, when I have 
brought in Britannia speaking of the King, I sup- 
pose her to be the representative or mouth of the 
nation as a body. But if I say we are full of such 
who daily affront the King and abuse his friends, 
who print scurrilous pamphlets, virulent lampoons, 
and reproachful public banter against both the 
King's person and Government, I say nothing but 
what is too true. And that the satire is directed 
at such I freely own, and cannot say but I should 
think it very hard to be censured for this satire 
while such remain unquestioned and tacitly ap- 
proved. That I can mean none but such is plain 
from these few lines : — 

" Ye Heavens, regard ! Almighty Jove, look down, 
And view thy injured monarch on the throne. 
On their ungrateful heads due vengeance take 
Who sought his aid and then his part forsake.*' 

If I have fallen upon our vices, I hope none but 
the vicious will be angry. As for writing for in- 
terest, I disown it. I have neither place, nor pen- 
sion, nor prospect; nor seek none, nor will have 
none. If matter of fact justifies the truth of the 
crimes, the satire is just. As to the poetic liberties, 
I hope the crime is pardonable. I am content to 
be stoned provided none will attack me but the 
innocent 

[224] 



AN EXPLANATORY PREFACE 

If my countrymen would take the hint and grow 
better-natured from my ill-natured poem, as some 
call it, I would say this of it, that though it is far 
from the best satire that ever was written, it would 
do the most good that ever satire did. 

And yet I am ready to ask pardon of some gentle- 
men too, who, though they are Englishmen, have 
good-nature enough to see themselves reproved, and 
can bear it. Those are gentlemen in a*tpie sense 
that can bear to be told of their faux pas and not 
abuse the reprover. To such I must say this is no 
satire ; they are exceptions to the general rule ; and 
I value my performance from their generous appro- 
bation more than I can from any opinion I have of 
its worth. 

The hasty errors of my verse I made my excuse 
for before ; and since the time I have been upon it 
has been but little, and my leisure less, I have all 
along strove rather to make the thoughts explicit 
than the poem correct. However, I have mended 
some faults in this edition, and the rest must be 
placed to my account. 

As to answers, banters, true English Billingsgate, 
I expect them till nobody will buy, and then the 
shop will be shut. Had I wrote it for the gain of 
the press, I should have been concerned at its being 
printed again and again by pirates, as they call 
them, and paragraph-men ; but would they but do 
vol. n. — 15 [226]

it justice and print it true according to the copy, 
they are welcome to sell it for a penny if they 
please. 

The pence indeed is the end of their works. I 
will engage, if nobody will buy, nobody will write. 
And not a patriot-poet of them all now will, in 
defence of his native country — which I have abused, 
they say — print an answer to it, and give it about 
for God's sake. 



[226] 



THE PREFACE 

THE end of satire is reformation ; and the 
author, though he doubts the work of 
conversion is at a general stop, has put 
his hand to the plough. 
I expect a storm of ill language from the fury of 
the town, and especially from those whose English 
talent it is to rail. And without being taken for a 
conjuror, I may venture to foretell that I shall be 
cavilled at about my mean style, rough verse, and 
incorrect language; things I might indeed have 
taken more care in, but the book is printed; and 
though I see some faults, it is too late to mend 
them. And this is all I think needful to say to 
them. 

Possibly somebody may take me for a Dutchman, 
in which they are mistaken. But I am one that 
would be glad to see Englishmen behave themselves 
better to strangers and to governors also, that one 
might not be reproached in foreign countries for 
belonging to a nation that wants manners. 

I assure you, gentlemen, strangers use us better 
abroad ; and we can give no reason but our ill-nature 
for the contrary here. 

[227] 



THE PREFACE 

Metbinks an Englishman, who is so proud of 
being called a good fellow, should be civil ; and it 
cannot be denied but we are in many cases, and par- 
ticularly to strangers, the churlishest people alive. 

As to vices, who can dispute our intemperance, 
while an honest drunken fellow is a character in a 
man's praise? All our reformations are banters, 
and will be so till our magistrates and gentry reform 
themselves by way of example. Then, and not till 
then, they may be expected to punish others without 
blushing. 

As to our ingratitude, I desire to be understood 
of that particular people who, pretending to be 
Protestants, have all along endeavoured to reduce 
the liberties and religion of this nation into the 
hands of King James and his Popish Powers; 
together with such who enjoy the peace and pro- 
tection of the present Government, and yet abuse 
and affront the King, who procured it, and openly 
profess their uneasiness under him. These, by what- 
soever names or titles they are dignified or distin- 
guished, are the people aimed at ; nor do I disown 
but that it is so much the temper of an Englishman 
to abuse his benefactor that I could be glad to see 
it rectified. 

I Those who think I have been guilty of any error 

in exposing the crimes of my own countrymen to 

themselves may, among many honest instances of

THE PREFACE 

the like nature, find the same thing in Mr. Cowley, 
in his imitation of the second Olympic ode of 
Pindar. His words are these — 

" But in this thankless world the givers 

Are envied even by the receivers : 
T is now the cheap and frugal fashion 
Rather to hide than pay an obligation. 

Nay, 'tis much worse than so ; 

It now an artifice doth grow 

Wrongs and outrages to do, 
Lest men should think we owe." 



[229] 



THE INTRODUCTION 

SPEAK, Satire ; for there 's none can tell like 
thee 
Whether 't is folly, pride, or knavery 
That makes this discontented land appear 
Less happy now in times of peace than war ? 
Why civil feuds disturb the nation more 
Than all our bloody wars have done before ? 

Fools out of favour grudge at knaves in place, 
And men are always honest in disgrace : 
The Court preferments make men knaves in course ; 
But they which would be in them would be worse. 
T is not at foreigners that we repine, 
Would foreigners their perquisites resign : 
The grand contention 's plainly to be seen, 
To get some men put out, and some put in. 
For this our Senators make long harangues, 
And florid Members whet their polished tongues. 
Statesmen are always sick of one disease, 
And a good pension gives them present ease : 
That's the specific makes them all content 
With any King and any Government 
[281] 



THE INTRODUCTION 

Good patriots at Court abuses rail, 
And all the nation's grievances bewail ; 
But when the sovereign balsam 's once applied, 
The zealot never fails to change his side ; 
And when he must the golden key resign, 
The railing spirit comes about again. 

Who shall this bubbled nation disabuse. 
While they their own felicities refuse, 
Who at the wars have made such mighty pother, 
And now are falling out with one another : 
With needless fears the jealous nation fill, 
And always have been saved against their will : 
Who fifty millions sterling have disbursed, 
To be with peace and too much plenty cursed : 
Who their old monarch eagerly undo, 
And yet uneasily obey the new ? 
Search, Satire, search : a deep incision make ; 
The poison 's strong, the antidote "s too weak. 
Tis pointed Truth must manage this dispute, 
And downright English, Englishmen confute. 

Whet thy just anger at the nation's pride, 
And with keen phrase repel the vicious tide ; 
To Englishmen their own beginnings show, 
And ask them why they slight their neighbours so. 
Go back to elder times and ages past, 
And nations into long oblivion cast ; 
To old Britannia's youthful days retire, 
And there for true-born Englishmen inquire. 
[232] 



THE INTRODUCTION 

Britannia freely will disown the name, 

And hardly knows herself from whence they came 

Wonders that they of all men should pretend 

To birth and blood, and for a name contend. 

Go back to causes where our follies dwell, 

And fetch the dark original from hell : 

Speak, Satire, for there 's none like thee can telL

THE 

TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 
PART I 

WHEREVER God erects a house of 
prayer, 
The Devil always builds a chapel 
there: 1 
And 't will be found upon examination, 
The latter has the largest congregation : 
For ever since he first debauched the mind, 
He made a perfect conquest of mankind. 
With uniformity of service, he 
Reigns with a general aristocracy. 
No non-conforming sects disturb his reign, 
For of his yoke there *s very few complain. 
He knows the genius and the inclination, 
And matches proper sins for every nation, 
He needs no standing-army government ; 

1 This old proverb was quoted by Robert Burton in his 
44 Anatomy of Melancholy " (1691), " Where God hath a temple 
the Devil hath a chapel " (Part III. sc. iv. subs. 1). It was also 
No. 670 in George Herbert's " Jacula Prudentium," first pub- 
lished in 1640, where it ran, " No sooner is a temple built to 
God but the Devil builds a chapel hard by." Defoe was the 
first rhymer of the proverb, and the rider to it is his own. 

[285] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

He always rules us by our own consent : 

His laws are easy, and his gentle sway 

Makes it exceeding pleasant to obey : 

The list of his vicegerents and commanders, 

Outdoes your Caesars or your Alexanders. 

They never fail of his infernal aid, 

And he 's as certain ne'er to be betrayed. 

Through all the world they spread his vast command, 

And Death's eternal empire is maintained. 

They rule so politicly and so well, 

As if they were Lords Justices of Hell, 

Duly divided to debauch mankind, 

And plant infernal dictates in his mind. 

Pride, the first peer, and president of Hell, 
To his share Spain, the largest province, felL 
The subtile Prince thought fittest to bestow 
On these the golden mines of Mexico, 
With all the silver mountains of Peru, 
Wealth which would in wise hands the world undo : 
Because he knew their genius was such, 
Too lazy and too haughty to be rich. 
So proud a people, so above their fate, 
That if reduced to beg, they 11 beg in state ; 
Lavish of money to be counted brave, 
And proudly starve because they scorn to save. 
Never was nation in the world before 
So very rich and yet so very poor. 

Lust chose the torrid zone of Italy, 
[286] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

Where blood ferments in rapes and sodomy : 
Where swelling veins overflow with liquid streams, 
With heat impregnate from Vesuvian flames : 
Whose flowing sulphur forms infernal lakes, 
And human body of the soil partakes. 
Their nature ever burns with hot desires, 
Fanned with luxuriant air from subterranean fires ; 
Here, undisturbed in floods of scalding lust, 
The Infernal King reigns with infernal gust. 

Drunkenness, the darling favourite of Hell, 
Chose Germany to rule ; and rules so well, 
No subjects more obsequiously obey, 
None please so well or are so pleased as they. 
The cunning artist manages so well, 
He lets them bow to Heaven and drink to Hell. 
If but to wine and him they homage pay, 
He cares not to what deity they pray, 
What God they worship most, or in what way. 
Whether by Luther, Calvin, or by Rome 
They sail for Heaven, by Wine he steers them home. 

Ungoverned Passion settled first in France, 
Where mankind lives in haste and thrives by chance ; 
A dancing nation, fickle and untrue, 
Have oft undone themselves and others too ; 
Prompt the infernal dictates to obey, 
And in Hell's favour none more great than they. 

The Pagan world he blindly leads away, 
And personally rules with arbitrary sway ; 
[237] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

The mask thrown off, plain Devil his title stands, 
And what elsewhere he tempts he there commands. 
There with full gust the ambition of his mind 
Governs, as he of old in Heaven designed. 
Worshipped as God, his Paynim altars smoke, 
Embrued with blood of those that him invoke. 

The rest by Deputies he rules as well, 
And plants the distant colonies of HelL 
By them his secret power he maintains, 
And binds the world in his infernal chains. 

By Zeal the Irish, and the Russ by Folly 
Fury the Dane, the Swede by Melancholy ; 
By stupid Ignorance the Muscovite ; 
The Chinese by a child of Hell called Wit 
Wealth makes the Persian too effeminate, 
And Poverty the Tartars desperate ; 
The Turks and Moors by Mah'met he subdues, 
And God has given him leave to rule the Jews. 
Rage rules the Portuguese and Fraud the Scotch, 
Revenge the Pole and Avarice the Dutch. 

Satire, be kind, and draw a silent veil 
Thy native England's vices to conceal ; 
Or, if that task 's impossible to do, 
At least be just and show her virtues too — 
Too great the first ; alas, the last too few ! 

England, unknown as yet, unpeopled lay ; 
Happy had she remained so to this day, 
And not to every nation been a prey. 
[238] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

Her open harbours and her fertile plains 

(The merchant's glory those, and these the Swain's) 

To every barbarous nation have betrayed her, 

Who conquer her as oft as they invade her ; 

So beauty 's guarded but by innocence, 

That ruins her, which should be her defence. 

Ingratitude, a devil of black renown, 
Possessed her very early for his own. 
An ugly, surly, sullen, selfish spirit, 
Who Satan's worst perfections does inherit ; 
Second to him in malice and in force, 
All devil without, and all within him worse. 
He made her first-born race to be so rude, 
And suffered her so oft to be subdued ; 
By several crowds of wandering thieves o'errun, 
Often unpeopled, and as oft undone ; 
While every nation that her powers reduced 
Their languages and manners introduced. 
From whose mixed relics our compounded breed 
By spurious generation does succeed, 
Making a race uncertain and uneven, 
Derived from all the nations under Heaven. 

The Romans first with Julius Caesar came, 
Including all the nations of that name, 
Gauls, Greeks, and Lombards, and, by computation 
Auxiliaries or slaves of every nation. 
With Hengist, Saxons ; Danes with Sueno came, 
In search of plunder, not in search of fame. 
[239] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

Scots, Picts, and Irish from the Hibernian shore, 
And conquering William brought the Normans o'er. 

All these their barbarous offspring left behind, 
The dregs of armies, they of all mankind ; 
Blended with Britons, who before were here, 
Of whom the Welsh ha* blessed the character. 

From this amphibious ill-born mob began 
That vain, ill-natured thing, an Englishman. 
The customs, surnames, languages, and manners 
Of all these nations are their own explainers : 
Whose relics are so lasting and so strong, 
They ha' 1 left a shibboleth upon our tongue, 
By which with easy search you may distinguish 
Your Roman-Saxon-Danish Norman English. 
The great invading Norman l let us know 
What conquerors in after times might do. 
To every musketeer 2 he brought to town, 
He gave the lands which never were his own. 
When first the English crown he did obtain, 
He did not send his Dutchmen back again. 
No reassumptions in his reign were known, 
D'Avenant might there ha" let his book alone. 
No Parliament his army could disband ; 
He raised no money, for he paid in land. 
He gave his legions their eternal station, 
And made them all freeholders of the nation. 
He cantoned out the country to his men,

And every soldier was a denizen. 
The rascals thus enriched, he called them lords, \ 
To please their upstart pride with new-made words, J- 
And Doomsday Book his tyranny records. J 

And here begins our ancient pedigree, 
That so exalts our poor nobility : 
T is that from some French trooper they derive, 
Who with the Norman bastard did arrive ; 
The trophies of the families appear, 
Some show the sword, the bow, and some the spear, 
Which their great ancestor, forsooth, did wear. 
These in the herald's register remain, 
Their noble mean extraction to explain, 
Yet who the hero was, no man can tell, 
Whether a drummer or a colonel : 
The silent record blushes to reveal 
Their undescended dark original. 

But grant the best, how came the change to pass, 
A true-born Englishman of Norman race ? 
A Turkish horse can show more history 
To prove his well-descended family. 
Conquest, as by the moderns l 't is expressed, 
May give a title to the lands possessed : 
But that the longest sword should be so civil 
To make a Frenchman English, that's the devil.

And rail at new-come foreigners so much,

THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

Forgetting that themselves are all derived 
From the most scoundrel race that ever lived ; 
A horrid crowd of rambling thieves and drones, 
Who ransacked kingdoms and dispeopled towns, 
The Pict and painted Briton, treacherous Scot, 
By hunger, theft, and rapine hither brought ; 
Norwegian pirates, buccaneering Danes, 
Whose red-haired offspring everywhere remains, 
Who, joined with Norman-French, compound the 

breed 
From whence your true-born Englishmen proceed. 

And lest by length of time it be pretended 
The climate may this modern breed ha' mended, 
Wise Providence, to keep us where we are, 
Mixes us daily with exceeding care. 
We have been Europe's sink, the jakes where she 
Voids all her offal outcast progeny. 
From the eighth Henry's time, the strolling bands 
Of banished fugitives from neighbouring lands 
Have here a certain sanctuary found : 
The eternal refuge of the vagabond, 
Where, in but half a common age of time, 
Borrowing new blood and manners from the clime, 
Proudly they learn all mankind to contemn, 
And all their race are true-born Englishmen. 

Dutch, Walloons, Flemings, Irishmen, and Scots, 
Vaudois and Valtelins, and Hugonots,

Supplied us with three hundred thousand men. 
Religion — God, we thank Thee ! — sent them hither 
Priests, Protestants, the Devil and all together : 
Of all professions and of every trade, 
All that were persecuted or afraid ; 
Whether for debt or other crimes they fled, 
David at Hachilah was still their head. 

The offspring of this miscellaneous crowd 
Had not their new plantations long enjoyed, 
But they grew Englishmen, and raised their votes 
At foreign shoals for interloping Scots. 
The royal branch * from Pictland did succeed, 
With troops of Scots and Scabs from North-by- 
Tweed. 
The seven first years of his pacific reign 
Made him and half his nation Englishmen. 
Scots from the northern frozen banks of Tay, 
With packs and plods came whigging all away : 
Thick as the locusts which in Egypt swarmed, 
With pride and hungry hopes completely armed ; 
With native truth, diseases, and no money, 
Plundered our Canaan of the milk and honey. 
Here they grew quickly lords and gentlemen, 
And all their race are true-born Englishmen. 

The civil wars, the common purgative, 
Which always use to make the nation thrive, 
Made way for all that strolling congregation

The royal refugee our breed restores, 

With foreign courtiers and with foreign whores, 

And carefully repeopled us again, 

Throughout his lazy, long, lascivious reign, 

With such a blest and true-born English fry, 

As much illustrates our nobility. 

A gratitude which will so black appear, 

As future ages must abhor to hear, 

When they look back on all that crimson flood, 

Which streamed in Lindsay's and Carnarvon's blood, 

Bold Strafford, Cambridge, Capel, Lucas, Lisle, 

Who crowned in death his father's funeral pile.

was first known to Charles II. as Mrs. Palmer. Afterwards her 
husband was made Earl of Castlemaine, and in 1668 she was 
made Duchess of Cleveland. Of the cost of this woman Andrew 
Marvell wrote : — " They have signed and sealed ten thousand 
pounds a year more to the Duchess of Cleveland ; who has 
likewise near ten thousand pounds a year out of the new farm 
of the country excise of beer and ale ; five thousand pounds a 
year out of the Post Office ; and, they say, the reversion of all 
the King's leases, the reversion of all places in the Custom 
House, the green-wax, and, indeed, what not? All promo- 
tions, spiritual and temporal, pass under her cognisance," &c 
Charles II. had by her five children.

Dover as a maid of honour, and was created Duchess of Ports- 
mouth in August 1673. She cost as much as Lady Castlemaine. 
Her son, Charles Lennox, was made Duke of Richmond. The 
Duchess of Portsmouth was living when this satire appeared. 
She died in 1734. 

* Frederick de Schomberg, an old favourite of King Wil- 
liam's, was made Duke of Schomberg on the 10th of April 1689. 
Another friend of the King's, William Bentinck, was created

was raised to a dukedom in 1716.

In every port they plant their fruitful train, 
To get a race of true-born Englishmen ; 
Whose children will, when riper years they see, 
Be as ill-natured and as proud as we ; 
Call themselves English, foreigners despise, 
Be surly like us all, and just as wise. 

Thus from a mixture of all kinds began 
That heterogeneous thing an Englishman ; 
In eager rapes and furious lust begot, 
Betwixt a painted Briton and a Scot ; 
Whose gendering offspring quickly learned to bow, 
And yoke their heifers to the Roman plough ; 
From whence a mongrel half-bred race there came, 
With neither name nor nation, speech nor fame ; 
In whose hot veins new mixtures quickly ran, 
Infused betwixt a Saxon and a Dane ; 
While their rank daughters, to their parents just, 
Received all nations with promiscuous lust. 
This nauseous brood directly did contain 
The well-extracted brood of Englishmen. 

Which medley cantoned in a Heptarchy, 
A rhapsody of nations to supply, 
Among themselves maintained eternal wars, 
And still the ladies loved the conquerors. 
The Western Angles all the rest subdued, 
[246] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

A bloody nation, barbarous and rude, 

Who by the tenure of the sword possessed 

One part of Britain, and subdued the rest. 

And as great things denominate the small, 

The conquering part gave title to the whole ; 

The Scot, Pict, Briton, Roman, Dane, submit, 

And with the English-Saxon all unite ; 

And these the mixtures have so close pursued, 

The very name and memory 's subdued. 

No Roman now, no Briton does remain ; 

Wales strove to separate, but strove in vain ; 

The silent nations undistinguished fall, 

And Englishman "s the common name of all. 

Fate jumbled them together, God knows how ; 

What e*er they were, they Ve true-born English now. 

The wonder which remains is at our pride, 
To value that which all men else deride. 
For Englishmen to boast of generation 
Cancels their knowledge and lampoons the nation. 
A true-born Englishman 's a contradiction, 
In speech an irony, in fact a fiction ; 
A banter made to be a test to fools, 
Which those that use it justly ridicules ; 
A metaphor invented to express 
A man akin to all the universe. 

For, as the Scots, as learned men have said, 
Throughout the world their wandering seed have 
spread; 

[247] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

So open-handed England, 't is believed, 
Has all the gleanings of the world received. 

Some think of England 't was our Saviour meant, 
The Gospel should to all the world be sent, 
Since, when the blessed sound did hither reach, 
They to all nations might be said to preach. 

T is well that virtue gives nobility, 
How shall we else the want of birth and blood 

supply ? 
Since scarce one family is left alive 
Which does not from some foreigner derive. 
Of sixty thousand English gentlemen, 
Whose name and arms in registers remain, 
We challenge all our heralds to declare 
Ten families which English-Saxons are. 

France justly owns the ancient noble line 
Of Bourbon, Montmorency, and Lorraine, 
The Germans too their House of Austria show 
And Holland their invincible Nassau, 
Lines which in heraldry were ancient grown 
Before the name of Englishman was known. 
Even Scotland, too, her elder glory shows, 
Her Gordons, Hamiltons, and her Monroe, 
Douglas, Mackays, and Grahams, names well known 
Long before ancient England knew her own. 

But England, modern to the last degree 
Borrows or makes her own nobility, 
And yet she boldly boasts of pedigree ; 
[248] 



i 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

Repines that foreigners are put upon her, 

And talks of her antiquity and honour ; 

Her Sackvilles, Saviles, Capels, De la Meres, 

Mohuns, and Montagues, Darcys, and Veres, 

Not one have English names, yet all are English 

peers. 
Your Hermans, Papillons, and Lavalliers 
Pass now for true-born English knights and squires, 
And make good senate members or Lord Mayors. 
Wealth, howsoever got, in England makes 
Lords of mechanics, gentlemen of rakes : 
Antiquity and birth are needless here ; 
Tis impudence and money makes a peer. 

Innumerable City knights, we know, 
From Bluecoat Hospital and Bridewell flow ; 
Draymen and porters fill the city Chair 
And footboys magisterial purple wear. 
Fate has but very small distinction set 
Betwixt the counter and the coronet. 
Tarpaulin lords, pages of high renown, 
Rise up by poor men's valour, not their own. 
Great families of yesterday we show, 
And lords whose parents were the Lord knows who. 



[249] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 



PART II 

The breed 's described : Now, Satire, if you can, 
Their temper show, for manners make the man. 
Fierce, as the Briton ; as the Roman, brave ; 
And less inclined to conquer than to save ; 
Eager to fight, and lavish of their blood, 
And equally of fear and forecast void. 
The Pict has made 'em sour, the Dane morose ; 
False from the Scot, and from the Norman worse. 
What honesty they have, the Saxons gave them, 
And that, now they grow old, begins to leave them. 
The climate makes them terrible and bold, 
And English beef their courage does uphold ; 
No danger can their daring spirit pall, 
Always provided that their belly 's full. 

In close intrigues their faculty 's but weak, 
For generally what e'er they know they speak, 
And often their own counsels undermine 
By their infirmity, and not design ; 
From whence the learned say it does proceed, 
That English treasons never can succeed ; 
For they 're so open-hearted, you may know 
Their own most secret thoughts, and others too. 

The laboring poor, in spite of double pay, 
Are saucy, mutinous, and beggarly, 
[250] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

So lavish of their money and their time, 

That want of forecast is the nation's crime. 

Good drunken company is their delight, 

And what they get by day they spend by night. 

Dull thinking seldom does their heads engage, 

But drink their youth away, and hurry on old age. 

Empty of all good husbandry and sense, 

And void of manners most when void of pence, 

Their strong aversion to behaviour 's such, 

They always talk too little or too much ; 

So dull, they never take the pains to think, 

And seldom are good-natured, but in drink. 

In English ale their dear enjoyment lies, 
For which they 11 starve themselves and families. 
An Englishman will fairly drink as much 
As will maintain two families of Dutch : 
Subjecting all their labour to their pots ; 
The greatest artists are the greatest sots. 

The country poor do by example live ; 
The gentry lead them, and the clergy drive : 
What may we not from such examples hope ? 
The landlord is their god, the priest their pope. 
A drunken clergy and a swearing bench 
Has given the Reformation such a drench, 
As wise men think there is some cause to doubt 
Will purge good manners and religion out 

Nor do the poor alone their liquor prize ; 
The sages join in this great sacrifice ; 
[261] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

The learned men who study Aristotle, 

Correct him with an explanation bottle ; 

Praise Epicurus rather than Lysander, 

And Aristippus l more than Alexander. 

The doctors, too, their Galen here resign, 

And generally prescribe specific wine ; 

The graduate's study 's grown an easier task, 

While for the urinal they toss the flask ; 

The surgeon's art grows plainer every hour, 

And wine 's the balm which into wounds they pour. 

Poets long since Parnassus have forsaken, 

And say the ancient bards were all mistaken. 

Apollo 's lately abdicate and fled, 

And good King Bacchus governs in his stead ; 

He does the chaos of the head refine, 

And atom-thoughts jump into words by wine : 

The inspirations of a finer nature, 

As wine must needs excel Parnassus' water. 

Statesmen their weighty politics refine, 
And soldiers raise their courages by wine ; 
Cecilia gives her choristers their choice, 
And lets them all drink wine to clear their voice. 

Some think the clergy first found out the way, 
And wine's the only spirit by which they pray ; 
But others, less profane than so, agree 
It clears the lungs and helps the memory ; 

1 The drunkard's name for Canary. [D.F.] 
[252] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

And therefore all of them divinely think, 
Instead of study, 't is as well to drink. 

And here I would be very glad to know 
Whether our Asgilites may drink or no ; 
TK enlightening fumes of wine would certainly 
Assist them much when they begin to fly ; 
Or if a fiery chariot should appear, 
Inflamed by wine, they 'd have the less to fear. 
Even the gods themselves, as mortals say, 
Were they on earth, would be as drunk as they ; 
Nectar would be no more celestial drink, 
They 'd all take wine, to teach them how to think. 
But English drunkards gods and men outdo, 
Drink their estates away, and money too. 
Colon 's in debt, and if his friends should fail 
To help him out, must die at at last in gaol ; 
His wealthy uncle sent a hundred nobles 
To pay his trifles off, and rid him of his troubles ; 
But Colon, like a true-born Englishman, 
Drank all the money out in bright champagne, 
And Colon does in custody remain. 
Drunk'ness has been the darling of this realm 
E'er since a drunken pilot had the helm. 

In their religion they are so uneven, 
That each man goes his own by-way to Heaven, 
Tenacious of mistakes to that degree 
That evVy man pursues it separately, 
And fancies none can find the way but he : 
« [ 253 ] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

So shy of one another they are grown, 
As if they strove to get to Heaven alone. 
Rigid and zealous, positive and grave, 
And evVy grace but Charity they have. 
This makes them so ill-natured and uncivil, 
That all men think an Englishman the devil. 

Surlyto strangers, froward to their friend ; 
Submit to love with a reluctant mind. 
Resolved to be ungrateful' and unkind, 
If by necessity reduced to ask, 
The giver has the difficultest task ; 
For what 's bestowed they awkwardly receive, 
And always take less freely than they give. 
The obligation is their highest grief, 
And never love where they accept relief. 
So sullen in their sorrow, that 't is known 
They 11 rather die than their afflictions own ; 
And if relieved, it is too often true 
That they Tl abuse their benefactors too ; 
For in distress, their haughty stomach 's such, 
They hate to see themselves obliged too much. 
Seldom contented, often in the wrong, 
Hard to be pleased at all, and never long. 

If your mistakes their ill opinion gain, 
No merit can their favour re-obtain ; 
And if they Ve not vindictive in their fury, 
T is their unconstant temper does secure ye. 
Their brain "s so cool, their passion seldom burns, 
[254] • 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

For all 's condensed before the flame returns ; 
The fermentation 's of so weak a matter, 
The humid damps the fume, and runs it all to water. 
So, though the inclination may be strong, 
They're pleased by fits, and never angry long. 

Then, if good-nature shows some slender proof, 
They never think they have reward enough, 
But, like our modern Quakers of the town, 
Expect your manners, and return you none. 

Friendship, th* abstracted union of the mind, 
Which all men seek, but very few can* find : 
Of all the nations in the universe, 
None talk on 't more, or understand it less ; 
For if it does their property annoy, 
Their property their friendship will destroy. 

As you discourse them, you shall hear them tell 
All things in which they think they do excel. 
No panegyric needs their praise record ; 
An Englishman ne'er wants his own good word. 
His long discourses generally appear 
Prologued with his own wond'rous character. 
But first to illustrate his own good name, 
He never fails his neighbour to defame ; 
And yet he really designs no wrong — 
His malice goes no further than his tongue. 
But pleased to tattle, he delights to rail, 
To satisfy the lechVy of a tale. 
His own dear praises close the ample speech ; 
[255] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

Tells you how wise he is — that is, how rich : 
For wealth is wisdom ; he that 's rich is wise ; 
And all men learned poverty despise. 
His generosity comes next, and then 
Concludes that he's a true-born Englishman ; 
And they, 't is known, are generous and free, 
Forgetting and forgiving injury : 
Which may be trufe, thus rightly understood, 
Forgiving ill turns, and forgetting good. 

Cheerful in labour when they \e undertook it, 
But out of humour when they 're out of pocket. 
But if their belly and their pocket's full, 
They may be phlegmatic, but never dull : 
And if a bottle does their brains refine, 
It makes their wit as sparkling as their wine. 

As for the general vices which we find 
They 're guilty of, in common with mankind, 
Satire, forbear, and silently endure ; 
We must conceal the crimes we cannot cure. 
Nor shall my verse the brighter sex defame, 
For English beauty will preserve her name, 
Beyond dispute, agreeable and fair, 
And modester than other nations are : 
For where the vice prevails, the great temptation 
Is want of money more than inclination. 
In general, this only is allowed, 
They Ve something noisy, and a little proud. 

An Englishman is gentlest in command, 
[256] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

Obedience is a stranger in the land : 

Hardly subjected to the magistrate, 

For Englishmen do all subjection hate ; 

Humblest when rich, but peevish when they're 

poor, 
And think, what e'er they have, they merit more. 

The meanest English ploughman studies law, 
And keeps thereby the magistrates in awe ; 
Will boldly tell them what they have to do, 
And sometimes punish their omissions too. 

Their liberty and property 's so dear, 
They scorn their laws or governors to fear : 
So bugbeared with the name of slavery, 
They can't submit to their own liberty. 
Restraint from ill is freedom to the wise ; 
But Englishmen do all restraint despise. 
Slaves to their liquor, drudges to the pots, 
The mob are statesmen and their statesmen sots. 

Their governors they count such dangerous things, 
That 't is their custom to affront their kings : 
So jealous of the power their kings possest, 
They suffer neither power nor king to rest. 
The bad with force they easily subdue : 
The good with constant clamours they pursue ; 
And did King Jesus reign, they 'd murmur too. 
A discontented nation, and by far 
Harder to rule in times of peace than war : 
Easily set together by the ears, 
vol. u. — 17 [ 257 ] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

And full of causeless jealousies and fears : 
Apt to revolt, and willing to rebel, 
And never are contented when they 're well. 
No Government could ever please them long, 
Could tie their hands, or rectify their tongue : 
In this to ancient Israel well compared, 
Eternal murmurs are among them heard. 

It was but lately that they were oppressed, 
Their rights invaded, and their laws suppressed : 
When nicely tender of their liberty, 
Lord ! what a noise they made of slavery. 
In daily tumult showed their discontent, 
Lampooned the King, and mocked his Government. 
And if in arms they did not first appear, 
T was want of force, and not for want of fear. 
In humbler tone than English used to do, 
At foreign hands for foreign aid they sue. - 

William, the great successor of Nassau, 
Their prayers heard and their oppressions saw : 
He saw and saved them; God and him they 

praised, 
To this their thanks, to that their trophies raised. 
But, glutted with their own felicities, 
They soon their new deliverer despise ; 
Say all their prayers back, their joy disown, 
Unsing their thanks, and pull their trophies down ; 
Their harps of praise are on the willows hung, 
For Englishmen are ne'er contented long. 
[268] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN

The reverend clergy, too! Who would have' 
thought 
That they, who had such non-resistance taught, 
Should e'er to arms against their prince be brought). 
Who up to Heaven did regal power advance, 
Subjecting English laws to modes of France, 
Twisting religion so with loyalty, 
As one could never live and V other die. 
And yet no sooner did their prince design 
Their glebes and perquisites to undermine, 
But, all their passive doctrines laid aside, 
The clergy their own principles denied ; 
Unpreached their non-resisting cant, and prayed 
To Heaven for help and to the Dutch for aid. 
The Church chimed all her doctrines back again, 
And pulpit champions did the cause maintain ; 
flew in the face of all their former zeal, 
And non-resistance did at once repeal 

The Rabbis say it would be too prolix 
To tie religion up to politics : 
The Church's safety is suprema lex. 
And so, by a new figure of their own, 
Their former doctrines all at once disown ; 
As laws post facto in the Parliament 
In urgent cases have obtained assent, 
But are as dangerous precedents laid by, 
Made lawful only by necessity. 

The reverend fathers then in arms appear, 
[259] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

* 

And men of God become the men of war. 

The nation, fired by them, to arms apply, 

Assault their Antichristian monarchy ; 

To their due channel all our laws restore, 

And made things what they should have been 

before. 
But when they came to fill the vacant throne, 
And the pale priests looked back on what theyM 

done; 
How English liberty began to thrive, 
And Church of England loyalty outlive ; 
How all their persecuting days were done, 
And their deliverer placed upon the throne : 
The priests, as priests are wont to do, turned tail ; 
They "re Englishmen, and nature will prevail. 
Now they deplore the ruins they have made, 
And murmur for the master they betrayed, 
Excuse those crimes they could not make him mend, 
And suffer for the cause they can't defend. 
Pretend they M not have carried things so high, 
And proto-martyrs make for Popery. 
Had the prince done as they designed the thing, 
Have set the clergy up to rule the King, 
Taken a donative for coming hither, 
And so have left their King and them together, 
We had, say they, been now a happy nation. 
No doubt we had seen a blessed reformation : 
For wise men say 't is as dangerous a thing, 
[260] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

A ruling priesthood as a priest-rid king ; 

And of all plagues with which mankind are curst, 

Ecclesiastic tyranny "s the worst. 

If all our former grievances were feigned. 
King James has been abused and we trepanned ; 
Bugbeared with Popery and power despotic, 
Tyrannic government and leagues exotic : 
The Revolution "s a fanatic plot, 
William a tyrant, Sunderland a sot : 
A factious army and a poisoned nation 
Unjustly forced King James's abdication. 

But if he did the subjects' rights invade, 
Then he was punished only, not betrayed ; 
And punishing of kings is no such crime, 
But Englishmen have done it many a time. 

When kings the sword of justice first lay down, 
They are no kings, though they possess the crown : 
Titles are shadows, crowns are empty things : 
The good of subjects is the end of kings ; 
To guide in war and to protect in peace ; 
Where tyrants once commence the kings do cease ; 
For arbitrary power 's so strange a thing, 
It makes the tyrant and unmakes the king. 

If kings by foreign priests and armies reign, 
And lawless power against their oaths maintain, 
Then subjects must have reason to complain. 

If oaths must bind us when our kings do ill, 
To call in foreign aid is to rebel. 
[261] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

By force to circumscribe our lawful prince 

Is wilful treason in the largest sense ; 

And they who once rebel, most certainly 

Their God, and king, and former oaths defy. 

If we allow no mal-administration 

Could cancel the allegiance of the nation, 

Let all our learned sons of Levi try 

This ecclesiastic riddle to untie : 

How they could make a step to call the prince, 

And yet pretend to oaths and innocence ? 

By the first address they made beyond the seas, 
They Ye perjured in the most intense degrees ; 
And without scruple for the time to come 
May swear to all the kings in Christendom. 
And truly did our kings consider all, 
They VI never let the cleigy swear at all ; 
Their politic allegiance they 'd refuse, 
For whores and priests do never want excuse. 
But if the mutual contract were dissolved, 
The doubts explained, the difficulties solved, 
That kings, when they descend to tyranny, 
Dissolve the bond and leave the subject free, 
The government 's ungirt when justice dies, 
And constitutions are non-entities; 
The nation 's all a mob ; there 's no such thing 
As Lords or Commons, Parliament or King. 
A great promiscuous crowd the hydra lies 
Till laws revive and mutual contract ties ; 
[262] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

A chaos free to choose for their own share 
What case of government they please to wear. 
If to a king they do the reins commit, 
All men are bound in conscience to submit ; 
But then that king must by his oath assent 
To postukUus of the government, 
Which if he breaks, he cuts off the entail, 
And power retreats to its original. 

This doctrine has the sanction of assent 
From Nature's universal Parliament. 
The voice of Nature and the course of things 
Allow that laws superior are to kings. 
None but delinquents would have justice cease ; 
Knaves rail at laws as soldiers rail at peace ; 
For justice is the end of government, 
As reason is the test of argument. 
No man was ever yet so void of sense 
* As to debate the right of self-defence, 
A principle so grafted in the mind, 
With Nature born, and does like Nature bind ; 
Twisted with reason and with Nature too, 
As neither one or other can undo. 

Nor can this right be less when national ; 
Reason, which governs one, should govern all. 
Whatever the dialects of courts may tell, 
He that his right demands can ne'er rebel, 
Which right, if 't is by governors denied, 
May be procured by force or foreign aid ; 
[263] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

For tyranny's a nation's term of grief, 
As folks cry u Fire " to hasten in relief; 
And when the hated word is heard about, 
All men should come to help the people out. 

Thus England groaned — Britannia's voice was 
heard. 
And great Nassau to rescue her appeared, 
Called by the universal voice of Fate — 
God and the people 's legal magistrate. 
Ye Heavens regard ! Almighty Jove look down, 
And view thy injured monarch on the throne. 
On their ungrateful heads due vengeance take, 
Who sought his aid and then his part forsake. 
Witness, ye Powers ! It was our call alone, 
Which now our pride makes us ashamed to own. 
Britannia's troubles fetched him from afar 
To court the dreadful casualties of war ; 
But where requital never can be made, 
Acknowledgment 's a tribute seldom paid. 

He dwelt in bright Maria's circling arms, 
Defended by the magic of her charms 
From foreign fears and from domestic harms. 
Ambition found no fuel to her fire ; 
He had what God could give or man desire. 
Till pity roused him from his soft repose, 
His life to unseen hazards to expose ; 
Till pity moved him in. our cause t' appear ; 
Pity ! that word which now we hate to hear. 
[264] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

But English gratitude is always such, 

To hate the hand which doth oblige too much. 

Britannia's cries gave birth to his intent, 
And hardly gained bis unforeseen assent ; 
His boding thoughts foretold him he should find 
The people fickle, selfish, and unkind. 
Which thought did to his royal heart appear 
More dreadful than the dangers of the war; 
For nothing grates a generous mind so soon 
As base returns for hearty service done. 

Satire, be silent ! awfully prepare 
Britannia's song and William's praise to hear. 
Stand by, and let her cheerfully rehearse 
Her grateful vows in her immortal verse. 
Loud Fame's eternal trumpet let her sound ; 
Listen, ye distant Poles and endless round. 
May the strong blast the welcome news convey 
As far as sound can reach or spirit can fly. 
To neighboring worlds, if such there be, relate 
Our hero's fame, for theirs to imitate. 
To distant worlds of spirits let her rehearse : 
For spirits, without the help of voice, converse. 
May angels hear the gladsome news on high, 
Mixed with their everlasting symphony. 
And Hell itself stand in suspense to know 
Whether it be the fatal blast or no. 



[*65] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 



BRITANNIA 

The fame of virtue 't is for which I sound, 
And heroes with immortal triumphs crowned. 
Fame, built on solid virtue, swifter flies 
Than morning light can spread my eastern skies. 
The gathering air returns the doubling sound, 
And loud repeating thunders force it round ; 
Echoes return from caverns of the deep ; 
Old Chaos dreamt on 't in eternal sleep ; 
Time hands it forward to its latest urn, 
From whence it never, never shall return ; 
Nothing is heard so far or lasts so long ; 
*T is heard by every ear and spoke by every tongue. 

My hero, with the sails of honour furled, 
Rises like the great genius of the world. 
By Fate and Fame wisely prepared to be 
The soul of war and life of victory ; 
He spreads the wings of virtue on the throne, 
And every wind of glory fans them on. 
Immortal trophies dwell upon his brow, 
Fresh as the garlands he has won but now. 

By different steps the high ascent he gains, 
And differently that high ascent maintains. 
Princes for pride and lust of rule make war, 
And struggle for the name of conqueror. 
[266] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

Some fight for fame, and some for victory ; 
He fights to save, and conquers to set free. 
Then seek no phrase his titles to conceal, 
And hide with words what actions must reveal, 
No parallel from Hebrew stories take 
Of god-like kings my similes to make ; 
No borrowed names conceal my living theme, 
But names and things directly I proclaim. 
T is honest merit does his glory raise, 
Whom that exalts let no man fear to praise : 
Of such a subject no man need be shy, 
Virtue 's above the reach of flattery. 
He needs no character but his own fame, 
Nor any flattering titles but his name : 
William 's the name that 's spoke by every tongue, 
William "s the darling subject of my song. 
Listen, ye virgins to the charming sound, 
And in eternal dances hand it round : 
Your early offerings to this altar bring, 
Make him at once a lover and a king. 
May he submit to none but to your arms, 
Nor ever be subdued but by your charms. 
May your soft thoughts for him be all sublime, 
And every tender vow be made for him. 
May he be first in every morning thought, 
And Heaven ne'er hear a prayer when he 's left out. 
May every omen, every boding dream, 
Be fortunate by mentioning his name ; 
[267] 



THE TRUtf-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

May this one charm infernal power affright, 
And guard you from the terrors of the night ; 
May every cheerful glass, as it goes down 
To William's health, be cordials to your own. 
Let every song be chorused with his name, 
And music pay a tribute to his fame ; 
Let every poet tune his artful verse, 
And in immortal strains his deeds rehearse. 
And may Apollo never more inspire 
The disobedient bard with his seraphic fire ; 
May all my sons their graceful homage pay, 
His praises sing, and for his safety pray. 

Satire, return to our unthankful isle, 
Secured by Heaven's regard and William's toil ; 
To both ungrateful and to both untrue, 
Rebels to God, and to good-nature too. 

If e'er this nation be distressed again, 
To whomsoever they cry, they 11 cry in vain ; 
To Heaven they cannot have the face to look, 
Or, if they should, it would but Heaven provoke. 
To hope for help from man would be too much, 
Mankind would always tell them of the Dutch ; 
How they came here our freedoms to obtain, 
Were paid and cursed, and hurried home again ; 
How by their aid we first dissolved our fears, 
And then our helpers damned for foreigners. 
*T is not our English temper to do better, 
For Englishmen think every man their debtor. 
[268] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

T is worth observing that we ne'er complained 
Of foreigners, nor of the wealth they gained, 
Till all their services were at an end. 
Wise men affirm it is the English way 
Never to grumble till they come to pay, 
And then they always think, their temper 's such, 
The work too little and the pay too much. 
As frightened patients, when they want a cure, 
Bid any price, and any pain endure ; 
But when the doctor's remedies appear, 
The cure's too easy and the price too dear. 

Great Portland ne'er was bantered when he strove 
For us his master's kindest thoughts to move ; 
We ne'er lampooned his conduct when employed 
King James's secret counsels to divide : 
Then we caressed him as the only man 
Which could the doubtful oracle explain ; 
The only Hushai able to repel 
The dark designs of our Achitopel ; 
Compared his master's courage to his sense, 
The ablest statesman and the bravest prince. 
On his wise conduct we depended much, 
And liked him ne'er the worse for being Dutch. 
Nor was he valued more than he deserved, 
Freely he ventured, faithfully he served. 
In all King William's dangers he has shared ; 
In England's quarrels always he appeared : 
The Revolution first, and then the Boyne, 
[269] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

In both his counsels and his conduct shine ; 

His martial valour Flanders will confess, 

And France regrets his managing the peace. 

Faithful to England's interest and her king ; 

The greatest reason of our murmuring. 

Ten years in English service he appeared, 

And gained his master's and the world's regard : 

But 't is not England's custom to reward. 

The wars are over, England needs him not ; 

Now he's a Dutchman, and the Lord knows what. 

Schomberg, the ablest soldier of his age, 
With great Nassau did in our cause engage : 
Both joined for England's rescue and defence, 
The greatest captain and the greatest prince. 
With what applause his stories did we tell ! 
Stories which Europe's volumes largely swell. 
We counted him an army in our aid : 
Where he commanded, no man was afraid. 
His actions with a constant conquest shine, 
From Villa- Viciosa to the Rhine. 
France, Flanders, Germany, his fame confess, 
And all the world was fond of him, but us. 
Our turn first served, we grudged him the command 
Witness the grateful temper of the land. 

We blame the King that he relies too much 
On strangers, Germans, Hugonots, and Dutch, 
And seldom does his great affairs of state 
To English counsellors communicate. 
[270] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

The fact might very well be answered thus : 

He has so often been betrayed by us, 

He must have been a madman to rely 

On English Godolphin's fidelity. 

For, laying other arguments aside, 

This thought might mortify our English pride, 

That foreigners have faithfully obeyed him, 

And none but Englishmen have e'er betrayed him. 

They have our ships and merchants bought and 

sold, 
And bartered English blood for foreign gold. 
First to the French they sold our Turkey fleet, 
And injured Talmarsh next at Camaret. 
The King himself is sheltered from their snares, 
Not by his merit, but the crown he wears. 
Experience tells us 't is the English way 
Their benefactors always to betray. 

And lest examples should be too remote, 
A modern magistrate of famous note 
Shall give you his own character by rote. 
1 11 make it out, deny it he that can, 
His worship is a true-born Englishman, 
In all the latitude of that empty word, 
By modern acceptations understood. 
The parish books his great descent record ; 
And now he hopes ere long to be a lord. 
And truly, as things go, it would be pity 
But such as he should represent the City : 
[271] 



^HE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

While robbery for burnt-offering he brings, 

And gives to God what he has stole from kings : 

Great monuments of charity he raises, 

And good St. Magnus whistles out his praises. 

To City gaols he grants a jubilee, 

And hires huzzas from his own Mobilee. 1 

Lately he wore the golden chain and gown, 
With which equipped, he thus harangued the town. 

His Fine Speech, Etc. 

With clouted iron shoes and sheep-skin breeches, 
More rags than manners, and more dirt than riches ; 
From driving cows and calves to Leyton Market, 
While of my greatness there appeared no spark yet, 
Behold I come, to let you see the pride 
With which exalted beggars always ride. 
Born to the needful labours of the plough, 
The cart-whip graced me, as the chain does now. 
Nature and Fate, in doubt what course to take, 
Whether I should a lord or plough-boy make, 
Kindly at last resolved they would promote me, 
And first a knave, and then a knight, they vote me. 
What Fate appointed, Nature did prepare, 
And furnished me with an exceeding care, 
To fit me for what they designed to have me ; 
And every gift, but honesty, they gave me. 

1 "Mobile," applied to the movable, unstable populace, 
was first abridged to " mob " in Charles the Second's time. 
[272] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

And thus equipped, to this proud town I came, 
In quest of bread, and not in quest of fame. 
Blind to my future fate, a humble boy, 
Free from the guilt and glory I enjoy, 
The hopes which my ambition entertained 
Were in the name of foot-boy all contained. 
The greatest heights from small beginnings rise ; 
The gods were great on earth before they reached 

the skies. 

B well, the generous temper of whose mind 

Was ever to be bountiful inclined, 

Whether by his ill-fate or fancy led, 

First took me up, and furnished me with bread. 

The little services he put me to 

Seemed labours, rather than were truly so. 

But always my advancement he designed, 

For 't was his very nature to be kind. 

Large was his soul, his temper ever free ; 

The best of masters and of men to me. 

And I, who was before decreed by Fate 

To be made infamous as well as great, 

With an obsequious diligence obeyed him, 

Till trusted with his all, and then betrayed 

him. 
All his past kindnesses I trampled on, 
Ruined his fortunes to erect my own. 
So vipers in the bosom bred, begin 
To hiss at that hand first which took them in.

THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

With eager treachery I his fall pursued, 
And my first trophies were Ingratitude. 

Ingratitude, the worst of human wit, 
The basest action mankind can commit ; 
Which, like the sin against the Holy Ghost, 
Has least of honour, and of guilt the most ; 
Distinguished from all other crimes by this, 
That 't is a crime which no man will confess. 
That sin alone, which should not be forgiven 
On earth, although perhaps it may in Heaven. 

Thus my first benefactor I overthrew ; 
And how should I be to a second true ? 
The public trusts came next into my care, 
And I to use them scurvily prepare. 
My needy sovereign lord I played upon, 
And lent him many a thousand of his own ; 
For which great interests I took care to chaige, 
And so my ill-got wealth became so large. 

My predecessor, Judas, was a fool, 
Fitter to have been whipped and sent to school 
Than sell a Saviour. Had I been at hand, 
His Master had not been so cheap trepanned ; 
I would have made the eager Jews have found, 
For forty pieces, thirty thousand pound. 

My cousin, Ziba, of immortal fame 
(Ziba and I shall never want a name), 
First-born of treason, nobly did advance 
His master's fall for his inheritance, 
[274] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

By whose keen arts old David first began 
To break his sacred oath with Jonathan : 
The good old king, 't is thought, was very loth 
To break his word, and therefore broke his oath. 
Ziba "s a traitor of some quality, 
Yet Ziba might have been informed by me : 
Had I been there, he ne'er had been content 
With half the estate, nor have the government. 

In our late revolution 't was thought strange 
That I, of all mankind, should like the change ; 
But they who wondered at it never knew 
That in it I did my old game pursue ; 
Nor had they heard of twenty thousand pound, 
Which never yet was lost, nor ne'er was found. 

Thus all things in their turn to sale I bring, 
God and my master first, and then the King ; 
Till, by successful villanies made bold, 
I thought to turn the nation into gold ; 
And so to forgery my hand I bent, 
Not doubting I could gull the Government ; 
But there was ruffled by the Parliament 
And if I 'scaped the unhappy tree to climb, 
T was want of law, and not for want of crime. 

But my old friend, 1 who printed in my face 
A needful competence of English brass, 
Having more business yet for me to do, 
And loth to lose his trusty servant so,

Managed the matter with such art and skill 
As saved his hero and threw down the bilL 

And now I "m graced with unexpected honours, 
For which I ,'11 certainly abuse the donors. 
Knighted, and made a tribune of the people, 
Whose laws and properties I 'm like to keep well ; 
The custos rotulorum of the City, 
And captain of the guards of their banditti. 
Surrounded by my catchpoles, I declare 
Against the needy debtor open war ; 
I hang poor thieves for stealing of your pelf, 
And suffer none to rob you but myself. 

The King commanded me to help reform ye, 
And how 1 11 do it, Miss shall inform ye. 
I keep the best seraglio in the nation, 
And hope in time to bring it into fashion. 
For this my praise is sung by every bard, 
For which Bridewell would be a just reward. 
In print my panegyrics fill the streets, 
And hired gaol-birds their huzzas repeat. 
Some charities contrived to make a show, 
Have taught the needy rabble to do so, 
Whose empty noise is a mechanic fame, 
Since for Sir Belzebub they VI do the same. 

The Conclusion 

Then let us boast of ancestors no more, 
Or deeds of heroes done in days of yore, 
[276] 



THE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN 

In latent records of the ages past, 

Behind the rear of time, in long oblivion placed. 

For if our virtues must in lines descend, 

The merit with the families would end, 

And intermixtures would most fatal grow ; 

For vice would be hereditary too ; 

The tainted blood would of necessity 

Involuntary wickedness convey. 

Vice, like ill-nature, for an age or two 
May seem a generation to pursue ; 
But virtue seldom does regard the breed ; 
Fools do the wise, and wise men fools succeed. 
What is "t to us what ancestors we had ? 
If good, what better ? or what worse, if bad ? 
Examples are for imitation set, 
Yet all men follow virtue with regret 

Could but our ancestors retrieve the fate, 
And see their offspring thus degenerate ; 
How we contend for birth and names unknown, 
And build on their past actions, not our own ; 
They'd cancel records, and their tombs deface, 
And openly disown the vile degenerate race : 
For fame of families is all a cheat, 
Tis personal virtue only makes us great.

THE SHORTEST WAY WITH 

THE DISSENTERS 



SIR ROGER UESTRANGE tells us a 
story in his collection of fables, of the 
cock and the horses. The cock was gotten 
to roost in the stable among the horses, 
and there being no racks or other conveniences for 
him, it seems he was forced to roost upon the ground. 
The horses jostling about for room, and putting the 
cock in danger of his life, he gives them this grave 
advice, " Pray, gentlefolks, let us stand still, for fear 
we should tread upon one another." 

There are some people in the world, who now 
they are unperched, and reduced to an equality with 
other people, and under strong and very just appre- 
hensions of being further treated as they deserve, 
begin, with iEsop's cock, to preach up peace and 
union, and the Christian duties of moderation, for- 
getting that, when they had the power in their 
hands, these graces were strangers in their gates. 

It is now near fourteen years l that the glory and 
peace of the purest and most flourishing Church in

[281] 



THE SHORTEST WAY 

the world has been eclipsed, buffeted, and disturbed 
by a sort of men whom God in His providence has 
suffered to insult over her and bring her down. 
These have been the days of her humiliation and 
tribulation. She has borne with invincible patience 
the reproach of the wicked, and God has at last 
heard her prayers, and delivered her from the op- 
pression of the stranger. 

And now they find their day is over, their power 
gone, and the throne of this nation possessed by a 
royal, English, true, and ever-constant member of, 
and friend to, the Church of England. Now they 
find that they are in danger of the Church of Eng- 
land's just resentments ; now they cry out peace, 
union, forbearance, and charity, as if the Church had 
not too long harboured her enemies under her wing, 
and nourished the viperous brood till they hiss and 
fly in the face of the mother that cherished them. 

No, gentlemen, the time of mercy is past, your 
day of grace is over; you should have practised 
peace, and moderation, and charity, if you expected 
any yourselves. 

We have heard none of this lesson for fourteen 
years past. We have been huffed and bullied with 
your Act of Toleration ; you have told us that you 
are the Church established by law, as well as others ; 
have set up your canting synagogues at our church 
doors, and the Church and members Have been

WITH THE DISSENTERS 

loaded with reproaches, with oaths, associations, 
abjurations, and what not. Where has been the 
mercy, the forbearance, the charity, you have shown 
to tender consciences of the Church of England, that 
could not take oaths as fast as you made them ; that 
having sworn allegiance to their lawful and rightful 
King, could not dispense with that oath, their King 
being still alive, and swear to your new hodge-podge 
of a Dutch Government ? These have been turned 
out of their livings, and they and their families left 
to starve ; their estates double taxed to carry on a 
war they had no hand in, and you got nothing by. 
What account can you give of the multitudes you 
have forced to comply, against their consciences, 
with your new sophistical politics, who, like new 
converts in France, sin because they cannot starve ? 
And now the tables are turned* upon you ; you must 
not be persecuted ; it is not a Christian spirit 

You have butchered one' king, deposed another 
king, and made a mock king of a third, 1 and yet you 
could have the face to expect to be employed and 
trusted by the fourth. Anybody that did not know 
the temper of your party would stand amazed at the 
impudence, as well as folly, to think of it. 

Your management of your Dutch monarch, whom 
you reduced to a mere King of Clouts, is enough to 
give any future princes such an idea of your princi-

pies as to warn them sufficiently from coming into 
your clutches; and God be thanked the Queen is 
out of your hands, knows you, and will have a care 
of you. 

There is no doubt but the supreme authority of a 
nation has in itself a power, and a right to that 
power, to execute the laws upon any part of that 
nation it governs. The execution of the known 
laws of the land, and that with a weak and gentle 
hand neither, was all this fanatical party of this land 
have ever called persecution ; this they have mag- 
nified to a height, that the sufferings of the Hugue- 
nots in France were not to be compared with. 
Now, to execute the known laws of a nation upon 
those who transgress them, after voluntarily consent- 
ing to the making those laws, can never be called 
persecution, but justice. But justice is always vio- 
lence to the party offending, for every man is inno- 
cent in his own eyes. The first execution of the 
laws against Dissenters in England was in the days 
of King James the First ; * and what did it amount 

i On the 16th of July, 1604, the Puritan clergy within the 
Church were required to conform on or before the 30th of No- 
vember on pain of expulsion. On the 4th of December Whit- 
gift's successor, Richard Bancroft, was consecrated Archbishop 
of Canterbury. He strictly carried out this order, and declared 
every man, cleric or lay, to be excommunicated who questioned 
the complete accordance of the Prayer Book with the Word of 
God. On the 6th of September, 1690, the Mayflower left Eng- 
land with the first freight of English families that sought free-

to truly ? The worst they suffered was at their own 
request : to let them go to New England and erect a 
new colony, and give them great privileges, grants, 
and suitable powers, keep them under protection, 
and defend them against all invaders, and receive no 
taxes or revenue from them. This was the cruelty 
of the Church of England. Fatal leniency ! It was 
the ruin of that excellent prince, King Charles the 
First. Had King James sent all the Puritans in 
England away to the West Indies, we had been a 
national, unmixed Church ; the Church of England 
had been kept undivided and entire. 

To requite the lenity of the father they take up 
arms against the son; conquer, pursue, take, im- 
prison, and at last put to death the anointed of God, 
and destroy the very being and nature of government, 
setting up a sordid impostor, who had neither title 
to govern nor understanding to manage, but supplied 
that want with power, bloody and desperate counsels, 
and craft without conscience. 

Had not King James the First withheld the full 
execution of the laws, had he given them strict 
justice, he had cleared the nation of them, and the 
consequences had been plain : his son had never 
been murdered by them nor the monarchy over- 
whelmed. It was too much mercy shown them, was 

dom of worship where they came to be the founders of a New 
England across the sea.

THE SHORTEST WAY 

the ruin of his posterity and the ruin of the nation's 
peace. One would think the Dissenters should not 
have the face to believe that we are to be wheedled 
and canted into peace and toleration when they 
know that they have once requited us with a civil 
war, and once with an intolerable and unrighteous 
persecution for our former civility. 

Nay, to encourage us to be easy with them, it is 
apparent that they never had the upper hand of the 
Church, but they treated her with all the severity, 
with all the reproach and contempt that was possi- 
ble. What peace and what mercy did they show the 
loyal gentry of the Church of England in the time 
of their triumphant Commonwealth P How did they 
put all the gentry of England to ransom, whether 
they were actually in arms for the King or not, 
making people compound for their estates and starve 
their families ? How did they treat the clergy of the 
Church of England, sequestered the ministers, de- 
voured the patrimony of the Church, and divided 
the spoil by sharing the Church lands among their 
soldiers, and turning her clergy out to starve ? Just 
such measure as they have meted should be meas- 
ured them again. 

Charity and love is the known doctrine of the 

Church of England, and it is plain she has put it in 

practice towards the Dissenters, even beyond what they 

ought, till she has been wanting to herself, and in 

[286] 



WITH THE DISSENTERS 

effect unkind to her sons, particularly in the too much 
lenity of King James the First, mentioned before. 
Had he so rooted the Puritans from the face of the 
land, which he had an opportunity early to have done, 
they had not had the power to vex the Church as 
since they have done. 

In the days of King Charles the Second, how did 
the Church reward their bloody doings with lenity 
and mercy, except the barbarous regicides of the 
pretended court of justice ? Not a soul suffered for 
all the blood in an unnatural war. King Charles 
came in all mercy and love, cherished them, preferred 
them, employed them, withheld the rigour of the 
law, and oftentimes, even against the advice of his 
Parliament, gave them liberty of conscience ; * and 
how did they requite him with the villainous contri- 
vance to depose and murder him and his successor at 
the Rye Plot? 2 

King James, as if mercy was the inherent quality 
of the family, began his reign with unusual favour 
to them. Nor could their joining with the Duke of 
Monmouth against him move him to do himself 
justice upon them ; but that mistaken prince thought 
to win them by gentleness and love, proclaimed an

THE SHORTEST WAY 

universal liberty to them, and rather discounte- 
nanced the Church of England than them. 1 How 
they requited him all the world knows. 

The late reign is too fresh in the memory of all 
the world to need a comment ; how, under pretence 
of joining with the Church in redressing some griev- 
ances, they pushed things to that extremity, in 
conjunction with some mistaken gentlemen, as to 
depose the late King, as if the grievance of the 
nation could not have been redressed but by the 
absolute ruin of the prince. Here is an instance of 
their temper, their peace, and charity. To what 
height they carried themselves during the reign of a 
king of their own ; how they crept into all places of 
trust and profit ; how they insinuated into the favour 
of the King, and were at first preferred to the high- 
est places in the nation; how they engrossed the 
ministry, and above all, how pitifully they managed, 
is too plain to need any remarks. 

But particularly, their mercy and charity, the spirit 
of union, they tell us so much of, has been remark- 
able in Scotland. If any man would see the spirit 
of a Dissenter, let him look into Scotland. There 
they made entire conquest of the Church, trampled 
down the sacred orders, and suppressed the Episcopal

government with an absolute, and, as they suppose, 
irretrievable victory, though it is possible they may 
find themselves mistaken. Now it would be a very 
proper question to ask their impudent advocate, the 
Observator, pray how much mercy and favour did 
the members of the Episcopal Church find in Scot- 
land from the Scotch Presbyterian Government? 
and I shall undertake for the Church of England 
that the Dissenters shall still receive as much here, 
though they deserve but little. 

In a small treatise of the sufferings of the Episco- 
pal clergy in Scotland, it will appear what usage 
they met with ; how they not only lost their livings, 
but in several places were plundered and abused in 
their persons ; the ministers that could not conform 
turned out with numerous families and no mainten- 
ance, and hardly charity enough left to relieve them 
with a bit of bread. And the cruelties of the parties 
are innumerable, and not to be attempted in this 
short piece. 

And now to prevent the distant cloud which they 
perceived to hang over their heads from England. 
With a true Presbyterian policy, they put in for a 
union of nations, that England might unite their 
Church with the Kirk of Scotland, and their Presby- 
terian members sit in our House of Commons, and 
their Assembly of Scotch canting long-cloaks in our 
Convocation. What might have been if our fanatic 
vol.ii. -19 [289] 



THE SHORTEST WAY 

Whiggish statesmen continued, God only knows; 
but we hope we are out of fear of that now. 

It is alleged by some of the faction — and they 
began to bully us with it — that if we wont unite 
with them, they will not settle the crown with us 
again, but when Her Majesty dies, will choose a king 
for themselves. 

If they won't, we must make them, and it is not 
the first time we have let them know that we are 
able. The crowns of these kingdoms have not so far 
disowned the right of succession, but they may re- 
trieve it again ; and if Scotland thinks to come off 
from a successive to an elective state of government, 
England has not promised not to assist the right 
heir and put them into possession without any regard 
to their ridiculous settlements. 1 

These are the gentlemen, these their ways of treat- 
ing the Church, both at home and abroad. Now let 
us examine the reasons they pretend to give why we 
should be favourable to them, why we should con- 
tinue and tolerate them among us. 

First, they are very numerous, they say ; they are 
a great part of the nation, and we cannot suppress 
them. 

1 The oath taken by Tories against the legal right of the 
Pretender to the crown was said to reserve the question of his 
divine right of succession. Divine right was unchangeable, but 
laws were liable to change — and so far as they go, what to-day 
is treason may be loyalty to-morrow. 

[290] 



WITH THE DISSENTERS 

To this may be answered : — 

1. They are not so numerous as the Protestants 
in France, and yet the French King effectually 
cleared the nation of them at once, and we don't 
find he misses them at home. 1 But I am not of the 
opinion they are so numerous as is pretended ; their 
party is more numerous than their persons, and those 
mistaken people of the Church who are misled and de- 
luded by their wheedling artifices to join with them, 
make their party the greater ; but these will open 
their eyes when the Government shall set heartily 
about the work, and come off from them, as some 
animals which they say always desert a house when 
it is likely to fall. 

% The more numerous the more dangerous, and 
therefore the more need to suppress them ; and God 
has suffered us to bear them as goads in our sides 
for not utterly extinguishing them long ago. 

1 The Revocation of the Edict of Nantes was signed on the 
17th of October 1685. All Protestant churches were to be 
demolished, and their ministers who would not be converted 
were to leave France within a fortnight Fugitive reformers 
who did not return within four months would have their prop- 
erty confiscated. Lay Reformers were forbidden to leave 
France, on pain of the galleys for men and confiscation of body 
and goods for women. Those who remained were exposed to 
cruelties of the soldiery. The King thought that his way of 
conversion by dragoons had reduced a million and a half of 
French heretics to twelve or fifteen thousand ; but between the 
Revocation and the time when Defoe wrote this pamphlet, it 
has been estimated that 250,000 French Protestants left France 
to establish homes in England and elsewhere. 

[291] 



THE SHORTEST WAY 

8. If we are to allow them only because we cannot 
suppress them, then it ought to be tried whether we 
can or not ; and I am of opinion it is easy to be 
done, and could prescribe ways and means, if it were 
proper ; but I doubt not the Government will find 
effectual methods for the rooting the contagion from 
the face of this land. 

Another argument they use, which is this, that it 
is a time of war, and we have need to unite against 
the common enemy. 

We answer, this common enemy had been no enemy 
if they had not made him so. He was quiet in peace, 
and no way disturbed or encroached upon us, and 
we know no reason we had to quarrel with him. 

But further, we make no question but we are able 
to deal with this common enemy without their help ; 
but why must we unite with them because of the 
enemy ? Will they go over to the enemy if we do 
not prevent it by a union with them ? We are very 
well contented they should, and make no question 
we shall be ready to deal with them and the common 
enemy too, and better without them than with them. 

Besides, if we have a common enemy, there is the 
more need to be secure against our private enemies. 
If there is one common enemy, we have the less need 
to have an enemy in our bowels. 

It was a great argument some people used against 
suppressing the old money, that it was a time of 
[292] 



WITH THE DISSENTERS 

war, and it was too great a risk for the nation to 
run ; if we should not master it, we should be un- 
done. And yet the sequel proved the hazard was 
not so great but it might be mastered, and the suc- 
cess was answerable. The suppressing the Dissenters 
is not a harder work nor a work of less necessity to 
the public. We can never enjoy a settled, uninter- 
rupted union and tranquillity in this nation till the 
spirit of Whiggism, faction, and schism is melted 
down like the old money. 

To talk of the difficulty is to frighten ourselves 
with chimeras and notions of a powerful party, 
which are indeed a party without power. Diffi- 
culties often appear greater at a distance than when 
they are searched into with judgment and distin- 
guished from the vapours and shadows that attend 
them. 

We are not to be frightened with it ; this age is 
wiser than that by all our own experience and theirs 
too. King Charles the First had early suppressed 
this party if he had taken more deliberate measures. 
In short, it is not worth arguing to talk of their 
arms. Their Monmouths, and Shaftesburys, and 
Argyles are gone ; their Dutch sanctuary is at an 
end ; Heaven has made way for their destruction, 
and if we do not close with the Divine occasion, we 
are to blame ourselves, and may remember that 
we had once an opportunity to serve the Church 
[2931 



THE SHORTEST WAY 

of England by extirpating her implacable enemies, 
and having let slip the minute that Heaven pre- 
sented, may experimentally complain, Post est occash 
calva. 

Here are some popular objections in the way : — 

As first, the Queen has promised them to continue 
them in their tolerated liberty, and has told us she 
will be a religious observer of her word. 

What Her Majesty will do we cannot help ; but 
what, as head of the Church, she ought to do, is 
another case. Her Majesty has promised to protect 
and defend the Church of England, and if she can- 
not effectually do that without the destruction of 
the Dissenters, she must of course dispense with one 
promise to comply with another. But to answer 
this cavil more effectually : Her Majesty did never 
promise to maintain the toleration to the destruction 
of the Church ; but it is upon supposition that it 
may be compatible with the well-being and safety of 
the Church, which she had declared she would take 
especial care of. Now if these two interests clash, it 
is plain Her Majesty's intentions are to uphold, pro- 
tect, defend, and establish the Church, and this we 
conceive is impossible. 

Perhaps it may be said that the Church is in no 
immediate danger from the Dissenters, and therefore 
it is time enough. But this is a weak answer. 

For first, if a danger be real, the distance of it is 
[294] 



WITH THE DISSENTERS 

no argument against, but rather a spur to quicken 
us to prevention, lest it be too late hereafter. 

And secondly, here is the opportunity, and the 
only one perhaps that ever the Church had, to secure 
herself and destroy her enemies. 

The representatives of the nation have now an 
opportunity ; the time is come which all good men 
have wished for, that the gentlemen of England may 
serve the Church of England. Now they are pro- 
tected and encouraged by a Church of England 
Queen. 

What will you do for your sister in the day that 
sha shall be spoken for ? 

If ever you will establish the best Christian Church 
in the world ; if ever you will suppress the spirit of 
enthusiasm ; if ever you will free the nation from 
the viperous brood that have so long sucked the 
blood of their mother ; if ever you will leave your 
posterity free from faction and rebellion, this is the 
time. This is the time to pull up this heretical 
weed of sedition that has 60 long disturbed the peace 
of our Church and poisoned the good corn. 

But, says another hot and cold objector, this is 
renewing fire and faggot, reviving the act De 
Heretico Comburendo ; this will be cruelty in its 
nature, and barbarous to all the world. 

I answer, it is cruelty to kill a snake or a toad in 
cold blood, but the poison of their nature makes it a 
[295] 



THE SHORTEST WAY 

charity to our neighbours to destroy those creatures, 
not for any personal injury received, but for pre- 
vention ; not for the evil they have done, but the 
evil they may do. 

Serpents, toads, vipers, &c, are noxious to the 
body, and poison the sensitive life ; these poison the 
soul, corrupt our posterity, ensnare our children, 
destroy the vitals of our happiness, our future 
felicity, and contaminate the whole mass. 

Shall any law be given to such wild creatures? 
Some beasts are for sport, and the huntsmen give 
them advantages of ground ; but some are knocked 
on the head by all possible ways of violence and 
surprise. 

I do not prescribe fire and faggot, but, as Scipio 
said of Carthage, Deknda est Carthago. They are 
to be rooted out of this nation, if ever we will live 
in peace, serve God, or enjoy our own. As for the 
manner, I leave it to those hands who have a right 
to execute God's justice on the nation's and the 
Church's enemies. 

But if we must be frighted from this justice under 
the specious pretences and odious sense of cruelty, 
nothing will be effected : it will be more barbarous 
to our own children and dear posterity when they 
shall reproach their fathers, as we do ours, and tell 
us, " You had an opportunity to root out this cursed 
race from the world under the favour and protection 
[296] 



WITH THE DISSENTERS 

of a true English queen ; and out of your foolish 
pity you spared them, because, forsooth, you would 
not be cruel ; and now our Church is suppressed 
and persecuted, our religion trampled under foot, 
our estates plundered, our persons imprisoned and 
dragged to jails, gibbets, and scaffolds : your sparing 
this Amalekite race is our destruction, your mercy 
to them proves cruelty to your poor posterity.'" 

How just will such reflections be when our posterity 
shall fall under the merciless clutches of this un- 
charitable generation, when our Church shall be 
swallowed up in schism, faction, enthusiasm, and 
confusion ; when our Government shall be devolved 
upon foreigners, and our monarchy dwindled into a 
republic. 

It would be more rational for us, if we must spare 
this generation, to summon our own to a general 
massacre, and as we have brought them into the 
world free, send them out so, and not betray them 
to destruction by our supine negligence, and then 
cry, " It is mercy.'" 

Moses was a merciful, meek man, and yet with 
what fury did he run through the camp, and cut the 
throats of three-and-thirty thousand of his dear 
Israelites that were fallen into idolatry. What was 
the reason ? It was mercy to the rest to make these 
examples, to prevent the destruction of the whole 
army. 



THE SHORTEST WAY 

How many millions of future souls we save from 
infection and delusion if the present race of poisoned 
spirits were purged from the face of the land ! 

It is vain to trifle in this matter, the light, foolish 
handling of them by mulcts, fines, &c, — it is their 
glory and their advantage. If the gallows instead of 
the Counter, and the galleys instead of the fines, 
were the reward of going to a conventicle, to preach 
or hear, there would not be so many sufferers. The 
spirit of martyrdom is over ; they that will go to 
church to be chosen sheriffs and mayors would go 
to forty churches rather than be hanged. 

If one severe law were made and punctually exe- 
cuted, that whoever was found at a conventicle 
should be banished the nation and the preacher be 
hanged, we should soon see an end of the tale. They 
would all come to church, and one age would make 
us all one again. 

To talk of five shillings a month for not coming 
to the sacrament, and one shilling per week for not 
coming to church, this is such a way of converting 
people as never was known ; this is selling them a 
liberty to transgress for so much money. If it be 
not a crime, why don't we give them full license ? 
And if it be, no price ought to compound for the 
committing it, for that is selling a liberty to people 
to sin against God and the Government 
[298] 



WITH THE DISSENTERS 

If it be a crime of the highest consequence both 
against the peace and welfare of the nation, the 
glory of God, the good of the Church, and the hap- 
piness of the soul, let us rank it among capital 
offences, and let it receive a punishment in propor- 
tion to it 

We hang men for trifles, and banish them for 
things not worth naming ; but an offence against 
God and the Church, against the welfare of the 
world and the dignity of religion, shall be bought 
off for five shillings ! This is such a shame to a 
Christian Government that it is with regret I trans- 
mit it to posterity. 

If men sin against God, affront His ordinances, 
rebel against His Church, and disobey the precepts 
of their superiors, let them suffer as such capital 
crimes deserve. So will religion flourish, and this 
divided nation be once again united. 

And yet the title of barbarous and cruel will soon 
be taken off from this law too. I am not supposing 
that all the Dissenters in England should be hanged 
or banished, but, as in cases of rebellions and insur- 
rections, if a few of the ringleaders suffer, the mul- 
titude are dismissed ; so, a few obstinate people 
being made examples, there is no doubt but the 
severity of the law would find a stop in the com- 
pliance of the multitude. 

[299] 



THE SHORTEST WAY 

To make the reasonableness of this matter out of 
question, and more unanswerably plain, let us ex- 
amine for what it is that this nation is divided into 
parties and factions, and let us see how they can 
justify a separation, or we of the Church of England 
can justify our bearing the insults and inconveniences 
of the party. 

One of their leading pastors, 1 and a man of as 
much learning as most among them, in his answer to 
a pamphlet, entitled "An Inquiry into the Occa- 
sional Conformity," has these words, p. 87, " Do the 
religion of the Church and the meeting-houses make 
two religions ? Wherein do they differ ? The sub- 
stance of the same religion is common to them both ; 
and the modes and accidents are the things in which 
only they differ. ri P. 28 : " Thirty-nine articles are 
given us for the summary of our religion ; thirty-six 
contain the substance of it, wherein we agree ; three, 
the additional appendices, about which we have some 
differences," 

Now, if as by their own acknowledgment the 
Church of England is a true Church, and the differ- 
ence between them is only in a few modes and acci- 
dents, why should we expect that they will suffer 
galleys, corporeal punishment, and banishment for 

1 John Howe, in his answer to Defoe's request for a state- 
ment of opinion from him on Occasional Conformity. 

[300] 



WITH THE DISSENTERS . 

these trifles ? There is no question but they will be 
wiser ; even their own principles will not bear them 
out in it ; they will certainly comply with the laws 
and with reason ; and though at the first severity 
they may seem hard, the next age will feel nothing 
of it ; the contagion will be rooted out ; the disease 
being cured, there will be no need of the operation ; 
but if they should venture to transgress and fall 
into the pit, all the world must condemn their ob- 
stinacy, as being without ground from their own 
principles. 

Thus the pretence of cruelty will be taken off, and 
the party actually suppressed, and the disquiets they 
have so often brought upon the nation prevented. 

Their [numbers and their wealth make them 
haughty, and that is so far from being an argument 
to persuade us to forbear them, that it is a warning 
to us, without any delay, to reconcile them to the 
unity of the Church or remove them from us. 

At present, Heaven be praised, they are not 
so formidable as they have been, and it is our 
own fault if ever we suffer them to be so. Provi- 
dence and the Church of England seem to join 
in this particular, that now the destroyers of the 
nation's peace may be overturned, and to this end 
the present opportunity seems to be put into our 
hands. 

[801] 



THE SHORTEST WAY 

To this end her present Majesty seems reserved to 
enjoy the crown, that the ecclesiastic as well as civil 
rights of the nation may be restored by her hand. 
To this end the face of affairs have received such 
a turn in the process of a few months as never has 
been before ; the leading men of the nation, the 
universal cry of the people, the unanimous request 
of the clergy, agree in this, that the deliverance of 
our Church is at hand. For this end has Providence 
given us such a Parliament, such a Convocation, such 
a gentry, and such a Queen as we never had before. 
And what may be the consequences of a neglect of 
such opportunities ? The succession of the crown 
has but a dark prospect; another Dutch turn may 
make the hopes of it ridiculous and the practice 
impossible. Be the house of our future princes 
never so well inclined, they will be foreigners, and 
many years will be spent in suiting the genius of 
strangers to this crown and the interests of the 
nation; and how many ages it may be before the 
English throne be filled with so much zeal and can- 
dour, so much tenderness and hearty affection to the 
Church as we see it now covered with, who can 
imagine ? 

It is high time, then, for the friends of the Church 
of England to think of building up and establishing 
her in such a manner that she may be no more in- 
[302] 



WITH THE DISSENTERS 

vaded by foreigners nor divided by factions, schisms, 
and error. 

If this could be done by gentle and easy methods, 
I should be glad ; but the wound is corroded, the 
vitals begin to mortify, and nothing but amputation 
of members can complete the cure ; all the ways of 
tenderness and compassion, all persuasive arguments, 
have been made use of in vain. 

The humour of the Dissenters has so increased 
among the people, that they hold the Church in 
defiance, and the house of God is an abomination 
among them ; nay, they have brought up their pos- 
terity in such prepossessed aversions to our holy 
religion, that the ignorant mob think we are all 
idolaters and worshippers of Baal, and account it a 
sin to come within the walls of our churches. 

The primitive Christians were not more shy of a 
heathen temple or of meat offered to idols, nor the 
Jews of swine's flesh, than some of our Dissenters 
are of the Church, and the divine service solemnised 
therein. 

This obstinacy must be rooted out with the pro- 
fession of it ; while the generation are less at liberty 
daily to affront God Almighty and dishonour His 
holy worship, we are wanting in our duty to God 
and our mother, the Church of England. 

How can we answer it to God, to the Church, and 
[803] 



THE SHORTEST WAY 

to our posterity to leave them entangled with fanat- 
icism, error, and obstinacy in the bowels of the 
nation ; to leave them an enemy in their streets, that 
in time may involve them in the same crimes, and 
endanger the utter extirpation of religion in the 
nation ? 

What is the difference betwixt this and being 
subjected to the power of the Church of Rome, from 
whence we have reformed ? If one be an extreme cm 
one hand, and one on another, it is equally destruc- 
tive to the truth to have errors settled among us, let 
them be of what nature they will. 

Both are enemies of our Church and of our peace ; 
and why should it not be as criminal to admit an 
enthusiast as a Jesuit? Why should the Papist 
with his seven sacraments be worse than the Quaker 
with no sacraments at all? Why should religious 
houses be more intolerable than meeting-houses? 
Alas, the Church of England ! What with Popery 
on one hand, and schismatics on the other, how has 
she been crucified between two thieves ! 

Now let us crucify the thieves. Let her founda- 
tions be established upon the destruction of her 
enemies. The doors of mercy being always open to 
the returning part of the deluded people, let the 
obstinate be ruled with the rod of iron. 

Let all true sons of so holy and oppressed a 
[304] 



WITH THE DISSENTERS 

mother, exasperated by her afflictions, harden their 
hearts against those who have oppressed her. 

And may God Almighty put it into the hearts of 
all the friends of truth to lift up a standard against 
pride and Antichrist, that the posterity of the sons 
of error may be rooted out from the face of this 
land for ever.
