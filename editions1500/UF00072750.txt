NOTWITHSTANDING the acknowledged merit
of DE FOE's interesting narrative of the Adven-
tures of Robinson Crusoe, it will be admitted,
that, as he did not address it expressly to Young

Persons, it must contain many things which are

not well adapted to an early age, and which,
when read by them, it were better should be
omitted. At the same time, no book lays such
strong hold on the curiosity of Youth as this
narrative ; and many eminent writers have strongly
recommended it, as deserving a preference over
every other human production, on account of the
lively picture it conveys of man residing in a
state of nature, and of the means necessary
to attain a state of enjoyment and easy sub-
sistence.

The design of the Editor, therefore, has been,
to render a book possessing such claims to po-
pularity as unexceptionable as possible. He has

at the same time preserved the spirit of the
narrative; and, he believes, the story will not
be found to have lost any of its interest from

the verbal alterations which he has judged it

necessary to make.

ADVENTURES

OF

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

 

I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of.
York, of wealthy and respectable parents. My
father intended to educate me for the profession
of the law; but- I, unfortunately, acquired so
earnest a desire for going to sea, that not even
the commands of my father, the entreaties of my
mother, nor the remonstrances of my other
friends, could induce me entirely to conquer
my childish propensity. '

For some time, indeed, after I first made my
inclination known, the calm and steady advice
of my father, which was accompanied with tears
of affection, so wrought upon me, that I resolved

B
not to think any more of going to sea, and to
conform myself to the affectionate wishes of my
parents: but, about twelx'e months afterwards,
going by chance to Hull, I there met with a
former school-fellow, the son of a sea-captain,
who, unfortunately for me, was then going to
London in his father's ship. This lad, not more
wise or prudent than myself, persuaded me to go
to sea with him, which I, like an undutiful, un-
grateful son, consented to do; and, without more
consideration, abandoned my comfortable home,
and embarked on the first of September, leaving
my parents in utter ignorance what was become

of me.

Scarcely had we put to sea when a violent
storm arose. I was also excessively sea-sick;
and in the midst of my pain and terror, I re--
pented bitterly of my folly, and made many good

resolutions for the government of my future con-

duct.

It was now that my want of duty, and my
ingratitude to the best of parents, wrung my
heart; yet, no sooner was the storm over, and
my sickness abated, than the raillery of my com-
panion, the captain's son, chased away all my '

good resolutions: I became both satisfied withROBINSON causoa. 3

my situation, and forgot the anguish which my
excellent parents were enduring for my sake.

On the sixth day of our being at sea, we came
into Yarmouth Roads, and the wind being con-
trary, we were obliged to cast anchor there. The
wind continued during four or five days to' blow
very hard; but the sailors, thinking themselves as

secure as if they were at anchor in a harbour, spent
the time merrily. On the eighth day, however,

it blew a terrible storm indeed, and I beheld ter-
ror and amazement in every countenance. The

sea ran mountains high, and broke upon us every
three or four minutes. The seamen were conti-
nually exclaiming that the ship would founder.
I did not know what they meant by founder, and
no one had leisure or composure enough to give
me any information. In the middle of the night

one of the men cried out that we had sprung a
leak, and all hands were called to the pump. I
heard the master express this melancholy ejacu-

lation, " Lord have mercy upon us, we shall be
all lost and undone!" At that dreadful sound

I fell backwards upon the bed where I was sit-
ting; but the men soon roused me, and drove

- me to the pump, saying, that if I could not

B2
do any thing else, Iwas as able to pump as
another.

The captain, meanwhile, ordered guns to be
fired, as signals of distress, and a ship at some
distance ventured to send out her boat to our

assistance. It was with the greatest danger
and difficulty that the boat could come near

us; but the sailors ventured their lives to save
ours; and we had not been more than a quarter
of an hour out ofour ship, when we saw her sink
with her whole eargo on board.

The boat struggled many hours with the wind
and waves before she reached the shore. At

length, however, we got Safe to land, and tra-
velled on foot to Yarmefath, where the magis-

trates and inhabitants pitied our destitute condi-
tion; and having lodged and fed us for a few
days, they gave us money to carry us either to
London or back to Hull, as we thought fit.

Had I now had the sense and goodness to have
gone home again, I should have been happy, and
my father would have been spared the misery of
supposing I had perished; for it was some time
before he had any assurance of my having es-

caped drowning in the ship that had foundered at
sea. But false shame withheld me from doing

my duty: for it occurred to me that I should he
laughed at among my neighbours and friends:
and thus, like many other foolish young people,
I was ashamed to repent, though I had not been

ashamed to sin.
The evil influence which first carried me away

from my father's house hurried me on with the
wild notion of making my fortune. I travelled
to London, and soon got acquainted with the
master of a vessel bound to the coast of Africa,

or, as sailors call it, to the coast of Guinea.

With this captain I engaged to go to Africa;
and having written to some of my friends, who,
I suppose, prevailed on my father or mother to
contribute something towards my purchasing
what was necessary for my voyage, I had 401.
remitted to me, and bought with it such toys and
articles as the captain told me I might barter
with'the natives for gold dust.

My voyage was a very successful one: for I
brought home nearly 3001. in gold dust, and had
learned from the captain, who took great pleasure
in giving me instruction, the arts of navigation
and mathematics. He also treated me as his
son, and had he lived he would have prevailed

B 3
on me to return to my parents; but scarcely had
the ship reached the port of London, when my
good friend, the captain, died, and his mate suc-
ceeded to the command of the vessel. Deter-
mined to pursue the course which had hitherto
proved so fortunate, I laid out 1001. in articles
for traffic, depositing the other 2001. in the hands
of my friend, the captain's widow, and set sail a
second time for the coast of Guinea.

Our ship steering towards the Canary Islands,
unfortunately fell in with a Turkish rover ofi'
Sallee: an obstinate engagement ensued; but
the pirates being superior in number, we were.
compelled at length to yield, and were carried
prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to the
Moors. I was kept by the captain of the rover
as his own slaxe; but the rest of the company
were carried up the country to the emperor's
palace.

When my new master went to sea again he.
left me on shore to do the usual drudgery of

slaves about his house and garden, and when
he came home from his cruise I was sent on
board the vessel to clean and look after the ship.
Many a sleepless night I spent in that cabin,
mourning over my hard fate in being condemned
to perpetual slavery, from which Isaw no likeli-
hood of escapino.

As I was young and active my master fourd
me constant employment, and made me assist in
building a little cabin in the middle of the long
boat belonging to our English ship, which he was
now fitting up for a pleasure-boat. We fre-
quently went out to fish in this boat; and one
day my master ordered us to have every thing
clean, and fit for the accommodation of several
of his friends, who were going on a party of
pleasure with him . -

Three fusccs, with powder and ball, a case of
liquors, and a quantity of provisions, were sent
on board the boat on the appointed day, and I,
a Moorish slave, and a boy, were lying on our
oars, waiting the arrival of the company, when
our master came to the beach in great haste, and
ordered us to row out into the bay to catch some
fish as expeditiously as possible, as his guests
were not going to sail that day, but were to sup

at his house with other company.

At this moment the hope of making my escape
darted into my mind. Beside the liquor and
provision on board, I knew there was plenty of
twine in a locker, with a hatchet, a saw, and a
hammer. The wind blew contrary to my wishes ;
but I was resolved, blow which way it would, to

be gone from slavery.

After we had fished some time, and caught
nothing, (for when I had fish on my hook I
would not pull them up), I said to the Moor, this
will not do; we must go farther out to sea. The
Moor made no objection; and having run out a
league, I gave the boy the helm, and stept for-
ward to where the Moor was busied with his fish-
ing tackle, and making as if] stooped to pick up
something behind him, Itook him by surprise,
and tossed him overboard.

He rose immediately, (for he swam like a
cork), and begged to be taken in again; but I
presented a gun, and said, Moloy, I intend you
no harm, if you will not come near the boat;
make the best of your way to the shore: I know
you can reach it with case. But ifyou persist
in following me, I will shoot you through the
head; for I am resolved to have my liberty. So
he turned round, and swam as fast as possible to
regain the shore.

I was under the necessity of serving the Moorish
slave thus, for I knew he was not to be trusted;

Xury, the boy, was an innocent, faithful, well-
meaning lad; and I knew he would be both use
ful and faithful to me.

After sailing five daysI believed myself to be
safe from pursuit, and ventured near the coast,
and cast anchor near the mouth of a little river.
I could not tell what latitude or what country we
were in. My aim in coming to the shore was
to get fresh water, and as soon as it was dark I
intended swimming on shore for that purpose;
but no sooner was the day closed, than we heard
the most dreadful roaring and howling of wild
beasts. Xury was excessively frightened, and

indeed so was I; but our fears greatly increased
when we heard one of these hideous creatures

come swimming towards our boat. We could not
see him, yet by his blowing we knew him to be a

huge and furious beast. I fired at him, upon which
he turned about and swam to the shore again,
howling most horribly. We no longer thought
of going on shore: but in the morning we found

that the water at the mouth of the river was
fresh, as the sea tide was out; so, having filled

our jar, we again set sail.
After coasting several days longer, we came

again to an anchor under a little point of land,
where Xury presently discovered a monstrous
lion, lying on the side of of a hilloek, fast asleep.
I loaded two of my guns, and firing the first, ex--
pected to have shot him dead; but my aim was
not a good one, for I only wounded him, and
broke one of his legs. He attempted to rise,
but instantly dropped with the most dreadful
roar I ever heard. As he lay struggling for life,
and uttering deep groans, Xury leaped into the
water, with the small gun in his hand, and com-
ing close to the lion, put the muzzle of the gun
to his ear, and fired into his head, which put
him in a moment quite out of his misery. But,
alas! the flesh ofa lion was no food for us; and
I was sorry to have wasted my powder and shot,
I resolved, however, to have his skin; and hav-
ing got off his hide, we dried it in the sun, and
it served me to lie upon.

After this we bore away to the southward, and
with all the care I had taken of our provisions,
they were nearly exhausted, and I began to fear
we should perish for want of food, whenwe came
once more in sight of land, and perceived, as we
came nearer the shore, that it was inhabited by
negroes, who were all perfectly naked. We were
afraid to land among these people, who came in

crowds to the beach to look at us; but we made__.. . ' >> (I'lldffllf. ' , lo'flzcczuo.
signs that we wanted something to eat, upon
which two of them ran away, and presently re-
turned with a piece of dried flesh and some
corn: these they brought to the edge of the

water, and then retired to a distance, (for they
were as much afraid of us as we were of them),
while Xury swam to the shore and brought it to
the boat.

We made signs of thanks, for we had nothing
to give in return, when presently two wild beasts
sprung from a neighbouring thicket, pursuing
each other with the utmost fury. The negroes

fled with great precipitation; but the creatures,
intent only upon each other, plunged into the
sea. I seized upon my gun and fired upon the
first. He immediately made for the shore, but

died before he reached it.
It is impossible to expressthe astonishment of

the poor negroes at the noise and fire of my gun:
but when they saw the creature actually dead,
their astonishment gave place to joy. It was a
beautifully spotted leopard. I gave the flesh to
the negroes, who are very fond of it, but kept
the skin for myself. Having got some more corn

and some water from them, we again put to sea,
and beat about during eleven days without offer-
ing to go near the shore. I now grew very pen-
sive, and was one morning meditating on my
misfortunes, when Xury suddenly cried out,
" Master, master; a ship with a sail l" And the
foolish boy was frighted out of his wits, think-
ing it must needs be one of his master's ships
sent to pursue us; but I knew we were got
far enough out of the reach of the Moors. I
jumped up, and immediately saw that it was a
Portuguese ship; and, as I thought, bound to
the coast of Guinea for negroes. But when I
observed the course she steered, I was soon

convinced they were bound some other way,
and did not design to come any nearer to the.
shore; upon which I stretched out. to sea as much

as I could, resolving to speak with them if pos>>
sible.

With all the sail I could make, I found I
should not be able to come in their way, but
that they would be gone by before I could make

any signal to them; but after] had crowded my
utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems,
saw, by the help of their perspective-glasses,
that it was some European boat, which they
supposed must belong to some ship that was
lost; so they shortened sail and lay by for
me, and in about three hours' time lcame up
with them.

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and
in Spanish, and in French, but I understood
none of those languages; but at last, a Scots
sailor, who was on board, called to me, and I
answered him, and told him I was an English-
man, and that I had made my escape out of
slavery from the Moors of Sallee: they then bid
me come on board, and very kindly took me in,

and all my goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, as any one
will believe, that I was delivered from such a mi-

serable and almost hopeless condition. I imme--

diately ofl'ered all I had to the captain of the ship,

as a return for my deliverance; but he generous-
ly told me, he would take nothing from me, but

that all I had should be delivered safe to me when
I came to the Brasils. " For," says he, " I have
saved your life on no other terms, than as I would
be glad to be saved myself; and it may one time
or other be my lot to be taken up in the same con-
dition: besides," observed he, " when I carry you
to the Brasils, so far from your own country, if
I should take from you what little you have, you

will be starved there, and then I only take away
(1l4 anvnxrcmas or

that lifelhave gixcn. No," said he, " Senhor
Inglcse (Mr. Englishman), I will carry you thi-
ther in charity; and those things you have will
help you to buy subsistence there, and your pas-
sage home again.

As he was charitable in this proposal, so was
he just in the perfimnance to a tittle; for he or-
dered that none of the seamen should offer to
touch any thing I had; he took every thing into
his own possession, and gave me back an exact
inventor} ofthem, that I might have them again
when we came to land, even so much as my three
earthen jars.

As to my boat, he saw it was a very good one,
and told me he would buy it from me for the ship's
use, and asked me what I would have for it. I
told him he had been so generous tome in every
thing, that I could not offer to make any price of
the boat, but left it entirely to him; upon which
he told me he would give me a note of hand to
pay me eighty pieces of eight for it at the Bra-
sils; and when it came there, if any one offered
to give more, he would make it up; he offered
me also sixty pieces of eight for my boy Xury,
which] was loath to take; not that I was unwil-
ling to let the captain have him, but I was very
loath to sell the poor boy's liberty, who had as~
sisted me so faithful in procuring my own.
However, when I let him know my reason, he
owned it to be just, and offered me this medium,
that he would give the boy an obligation to set
him free in ten years, if he turned christian.
Upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go
to him, I let the captain have him.

We had a very good voyage to the Brasils, and
arrived in the bay de Todos los Santos, or All
Saints Bay, in twenty--two days after. And now
I was once more delivered from the. most misera-
ble of all conditions of life; and what to do next
with myselfl had still to consider.

The generous treatment the captain gave me,
I can never enough remember: he would take
nothing from me for my passage, gave me twenty
ducats for the leOpard's skin, and forty for the
lion's skin, which I had in my boat, and caused
every thing I had to be punctually delivered to
me, and what I was willing to sell, he bought.
In short, I made about two hundred and twenty
pieces of money of all my cargo, and with this
stock I went on shore in the Brasils.

The captain recommended me to the house of
a good honest man like himself, who had'an in-

02'i6 finvnxTL'REs or

genio, as the}: call it, that is, a plantation and a
sugar-house. I lived with him some time, and
acquainted myself with the i tanner of their plant-
ing and making of sugar; and seeing how the
planters lived, and that they grew rich,I resolved,
if I could get a liCcnsc to settle there, I would
turn planter among them; intending, in the mean-
time, to find out some way to get my money,
which I had left in London, remitted to me. For
this purpose I got a letter of naturalixation,
purchasing as much land that was uncultivated
as my money would reach; and formed a plan of
my plantation and settlement, such a one as might.
be suitable to the stock which I proposed to re-
ceive from England.

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon,
but born of English parents, whose name was
Wells, and in much such circumstances asI was:
I call him neighbour, because his plantation lay
next to mine; and we went on very sociable to-
gether: my stock was but low as well as his; and
we rather planted for food than any thing else,
for about two years. However, we began to in-
crease, and our land to come. into order: so that
the third year we planted some tobacco, and

made each of us a large piece of ground readvnomxsou enusos. l 4

for planting canes in the year to come; but we
both wanted help: and now] found, more than
before, Iliad done wrong in parting with my
boy Xury.

But, alas! for me to do wrong, that never did
right, was no great wonder: I had no remedy
but to go on. I had got into an employment
quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary
to the life I delighted in, and for which I forsook
my father's house, and broke through all his good
advice; nay, I was coming to the very middle
station, or upper degree of low life, which my
father advised me to before, and which, if I re-
solved to go on with, I might as well have. stayed
at home, and never have fatigued myself in the
world as I had done. I used often to say to my-

:lf,----I could have done. this as well in England
among my friends, as to have gone five thousand
miles off to do it among strangers and savages
in a wilderness, and at such adistance, as never
to hear from any part of the world that had the

least knowledge of me.
In this manner I used to look upon my condi-

tion with the utmost regret. I had nobody to

converse with but now and then this neighbour;

no work to be done but by the labour of my own
6 3
hands; and I used to say, I lived just like a
man cast away upon some desolate island, that
had nobody there but himsel". But howjust has
it been; and how should all men reflect, that
when they compare their present condition with
others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them
to make the exchange, and be cominced of their
former felicity by their experience. I say, how
just has it been, that the truly solitary life I re-
flected on in an island, ofmere desolation, should
be my lot, who had so often unjustly compared
it with the life which I then led, in which, had I.
continued, I had in all probability been exceed-
ingly prosperous and rich!

I was in some degree settled in my measures for
carrying on the plantation, before my kind friend
the captain ofthe ship, that took me up at sea, went
back; for the ship remained there in providing her
loading, and preparing for her voyage, near three
months: when telling him what little stock I had
left behind me in London, he gave me this friendly
and sincere advice: " Scnbor Inglese," said be,
for so-he always called me, " if you will give me
letters and a procuration here in form, with or-
ders to the person who has your money in Lon-
don to send your effects to Lisbon, to suchRomNsoN cacsoe. 19

persons as I shall direct and in such goods as
are proper for this country, I will bring you the
produce of them (God willing) on my return;
but since human affairs are all subject to changes
and disasters, I would have you give orders but
for one hundred pounds sterling, which you say
is half your stock, and let the hazard be run for
the first; so that if that come safe, you may
order the rest the same way; and if it miscarry,
~you may have the other half to have recourse to
for your supply."

This was wholesome adrice, and looked so
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was
the best course I could take: so I accordingly
prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I
had left my money, and a procuration to the
Portuguese captain as he desired.

I wrote the English captain's widow a full ac-
count of all my adventures, my slavery, escape,
and how I had met with the Portuguese captain
at sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and in
what condition I was now in, with all other ne-
cessary directions for my supply; and when this
honest captain came to Lisbon, he found means
by some ofthe English merchants there, to send
over not the order only, but a full account of my
story to a merchant. in London, who represented
it effectually to her; whereupon, she not only
delivered the money, but out of her own pocket
sent the Portugal captain a handsome present for
his humanity and charity to me.

The merchant in London vesting this hundred
pounds in English goods, such as the captain had
written for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon,
and he brought them all safe to the Brasils;
among which, without my direction, (for I was
too young in my business to think of them), he
had taken care to ll'dVC all sorts of tools, iron-
work, and utensils necessary for my plantation,
and which were of great use to me.

When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune
made; and my good steward the captain had laid
out the money which my friend had sent him as
a present for himself, to purchase and bring me
over a servant under bond for six years semice;
and would not hear of any consideration, except
a little tobacco, which I would have him accept,
being of my own produce.

Neither was this all: but my goods being all
English manufactures, as cloth, stuffs, haize, and
things particularly valuable and desirable in the
country, I found means to sell them to a very
great advantage; so that I may say I had more
than four times the value of my first cargo, and
was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I
mean in the advancement of my plantation: for
the first thing I did, I bought. me a negro slave,
and an European servant also; I mean another

besides that which the captain brought me from
Lisbon.

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made
the very means of our greatest adversity, so was
it with me. I went on the next year with great
success in my plantation: I raised fifty great
rolls of tobacco on my own ground more than I
had disposed of for necessaries among my neigh-
hours; and these fifty rolls being each of above
one hundred pounds weight, were well cured and
laid by against the return of the fleet from Lisbon.
And now, increasing in business and wealth, my
head began to be full of projects and underta-
kings beyond my reach; such as are indeed often
the ruin of the best heads in business.

Having now lived almost four years in the
B 'asils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very
well upon my plantation, I had not only learned
the language, but had contracted acquaintance
and friendship among my fellow planters, as well
as amongr the merchants ot'St. Calvadore, which
was our port; and that in my discourse among
them, I had frequently given them an account of
my twoxoyages to the coast. of Guinea, the man-
ner ot' trading:r with the negroes there, and how
easy it. w as to purchase upon the coast. for trifles,
{such asbeads, toys, knives, scissars, hatchets,
hits (ll-glass, and the like), not only gold (last,
(iuiuea grains, elephants' teeth, t\"e. but. uegroes,
for the serx ice of the Brasils, in great numbers.

The planters always listened \'Cl'y attentively
to my conversation on this subject; but espe-
cially to that. part which related to the buying of
uegroes, which was a trade at that time not far
entered into; but as far as it was, had been car-
ried on by the permission of the kings ofSpain
and Portugal, and engrossed in the public. stock:
so that few negroes were bought, and those were
excessively dear.

Being in company with some merchants and
planters ofmy acquaintance, and talking of those
things Very earnestly, three of them came to me
the next morning, and told me they had been
musing very much upon uhatl had couversed
with them about the last night; and they came.

to make a propasal to me: and after enjoining
me to secrecy, they told me that they had a
mind to lit out a ship to go to Guinea; that they
had all plantations as well as I, and were strait-
ened for nothing so much as servants; that as
they could not publicly sell the negroes when
they came home, so they desired to make but
one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore pri-
vately, and divide them among their own plan-
tations; wishing that I would go their super--
cargo in the ship, to manage the trading part
upon the coast of Guinea; and they otfered me
that I should have my equal share of the ne-
groes, without providing any part of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed,
had it been made to any one who had not had a
settlement and plantation of his own to look
after, which was in a fair way of coming to be
very considerable, and with a good stock upon
it: but for me, that was thus established, and
had nothing to do but go on as I had begun for
three or four years more, and to have sent for
the other 1001. from England, and who in that
time, and with that little addition, could scarce
have failed of being worth 30001. or 4000]. and
that increasing too--for me to think of such a
voyage, was the most preposterous thing that
ever man in such a situation could be guilty of.
But I, that. was horn to be my own destroyer,
could no more resist, the odor than I could re-
strain my first. rambling designs, when my father's
good counsel was lost. upon me. In a word, I
told them [ would go with all my heart, it'they
would undertake to look after my plantation in
my absence, and would dispose of it to such
as I should direct, it'l miscarried. This they
all engaged to do, and entered into writings or
cmenauts to do so; and I made a formal will,
disposing of my plantation and ctl'ects in case of
my death, making the captain of the ship that.
had saved my life, as before, my unixersal heir;
but obliging him to dispose of my effects as I
had directed in my will: one half of the pro--

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve
my effects, and keep up my plantation. Had I
used half as nmch prudence to look into my
own interest, and form a correct judgment of
what Iought to have done and ought not to have

done, I had certainly never gone away from soaoninson cucsor. '25

prosperous an undertaking; leaving all the pro-
bable views of thriving circumstances, and ven-
turing upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its
common hazards, to say nothing of the reasons,

which I had to expect particular misfortunes to
befal myself.

ButI was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the
dictates of my fancy rather than my reason; and
accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the
cargo finished, and all things done as by agree-
ment with my partners in the voyage, I went on
board in an evil hour again, September 1, 1659,
being the same day eight years that I went from
my father and mother at Hull, in order to act
the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my
own interest.

We had been at sea about a fortnight when a
violent hurricane, or tornado, arose, and drove
us quite out of our knowledge. For twelve days
we heat about, at the mercy of the winds and
.waves, expecting to be swallowed up at every
instant. In this distress, the wind still blowing
very hard, one of our men early in the morning
cried out, " Land! " And scarcely had we time
to run up on deck tolook out, in 110pes of see-
ing whereabouts in the world we were, before

D
the ship struck upon a bank of sand; and in a
moment the sea broke over us with such vio-
lence, that we seemed to have but little chance
of escaping with our lives.

Only those persons who have been in the same
dreadful circumstances can imagine the grief and
terror with which we looked on one another, ig-
norant whether we were driven upon an unin-
habited island, or on a coast peopled by sa-
vages; expecting also that the ship would fall
to pieces every moment, by the violence with
which she beat upon the sand.

Our mate was the only person on board who
had presence ofmiud enough to think of throw-
ing the boat over the ship's side, and with great
difficulty we all (eleven of us) got into it, and
strove. with our utmost might to row to land;
but after we had rowed about a league and a
. half from the ship, a raging wave came rolling
mountain-like towards us: we foresaw the event.
----the wave overset the boat, and we were all
swallowed up in a moment.

Isaw no more of my unfortunate companions:
for the wave that threw us all into the sea, car-
ried me a vast way towards the shore, and, hav-
ing spent itself, went back, and left me upon the. ---.___

beach almost dry. I got upon my feet, and en-
deavoured to reach the main land; but another
enormous wave presently overtook me, and bu-
ried me at once twenty or thirty feet deep in its
own body, carrying me with a mighty force and
swiftness towards the shore; while I held my
breath, and assisted myself to swim forward with
all my might. Iwas ready to burst with hold-
ing my breath, when I felt my head and hands
shoot out above the surface of the water; and
though it was not two seconds of time thatI
could keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly,
gave me breath and new courage.

I stood still a few moments to recover breath,
when another wave, having hurried me along as
before, landed me, or rather dashed me against
a piece of a rock; and that with such force as
left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my
own deliverance: for had the wave returned
again immediately, I must have been sufi'ocated
in the water; but I recovered a little before the

return of the wave, and held fast by a part of

the rock till the waves abated, and then took

another run, which brought me so near the shore

that the next wave, though it went over me, yet

did not so swallow me up as to carry me awa ';
D 2
and the next run I took, I got to the main land,
where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the
cliffs of the shore, and sat down upon the grass,
free from danger, and quite out of the reach of
the water.

I was now landed and safe on shore, and be-
gan to look up and thank God that my life was
saved in a case which some minutes before af-
forded scarce any room to hope. I believe it is
impossible to express what the extacies and mm-
sports of the soul are when it is thus saved, as I
may say, out of the very grave:--

" For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first."

I. walked about on the shore, lifting up my
hands; and my whole beine' wrapped up in the

a,
contemplation of my deliverance, making a thou-
sand. gestures and motions which] cannot de-
scribe, reflecting upon all my companions that
were drowned, and that there should not be one
soul saved but myself: for, as to them, I never
saw them afterwards, or any sign of them, ex-

cept three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes
that were not fellows.

I cast my eyes toward the stranded vessel, and
could hardly see it, it lay so far ofl"; and again
I exclaimed, how was it possible I could get
on shore!

After I had solaced my mind with the con:-
fortablc part of my condition, I began to lock
round me, to see what sort of a place I was in,
and what was next to be done; when Isoon
found my comforts abate, and that I had had but
a dreadful deliverance. I was wet; had no
clothes to shift me, nor any thing either to eat
or drink, to comfort me; neither did I see any
prospect before me, but that of perishing with
hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts: and
that which was particularly afflicting to me was,
that I had no weapon either to hunt and kill any
creature for my sustenance, or to defend myself
against any other creatures that might desire to
kill me for theirs. I had nothing about me but
a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a
box; this was all my provision: and this threw
me into terrible agonies of mind, so that for a
while I ran about like a madman. Night com-
ing upon me, I began, with a heavy heart, to
consider what would be my lot if there were any
ravenous beasts in the island, knowing that at
night they always come abroad for their prey.

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at

' D 3
that time was, to get up into a thick bushy tree,
like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and
where I resolved to sit all night, and consider
the next day what death I should die: for as
yetI saw no prospect of life. Iwalked about
afurlong from the shore, to see if I could find
some fresh water to drink, which Idid to my
great joy; and having drank, and put a little
tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went
to the tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured
to place myself so as that, if I should sleep,
I might not fall. I cut a short stick, like a
truncheon, for my defence; and having been
excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept
as comfortably as I believe few could have
done in my condition, and found myself the
most refreshed with it, that I think I ever was

upon such an occasion.

I did not wake till it was broad day, the
weather clear, and the storm abated, so that the
sea did not rage as before; but that which sur-
prised me most was, that the ship was lifted off
in the night from the sand where she lay, by the
swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as

far as the rock which I first mentioned, where
I had been so bruised by being dashed against
it: this was within about a mile from the shore
where I was, and the ship seeming to stand up-
right, I wished myself on board, that, at least,
I might save some necessary things for my use.
When I came down from my apartment in the.
tree, I looked about me again, and the first thing
I found was the boat, which lay as the wind and
sea had tossed her upon the land, about two
miles on my right hand. I walked as far as I
could upon the shore to get to her, but found
a neck, or inlet, of water between me and the
boat, which was about half a mile broad: so I
came back for the present, being more intent
upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find
something for my present subsistence.

A little after noon I found the sea very calm,
and the tide ebbed so far out, thatI could come

within a quarter of a mile of the ship: so I pull-
ed off my clothes, for the weather was extremely
hot, and took the water; but when I came to the
ship, my difficulty was still greater to know how
to get on board, for as she lay aground and high
out of the water, there was nothing within my
reach to lay hold of : I swam round her twice,

and the second time I spied a Small piece of
rope, which I wondered I did not see at first,
hanging down by the fore-chains, so low, that with
little difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help
of that rope got up into the fore-castle of the ship.

Here I found that the ship was bilged, and
had a great deal of water in her hold, but that
she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand,
or rather earth, that her stern was lifted upon
the bank, and her head low almost to the wa-
ter; by this means all her quarter was free,
and all that part was dry; for you may be
sure my first work was to search and to see
what was spoiled and what was free; and
first I found that all the ship's provisions were
dry, and untouched by the water; and being
very well disposed to eat, I went to the bread--
room and filled my pockets wth biscuit, and eat
it as I went about other things, for I had no
time to lose. I also found some rum in the
great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and
which I had indeed need enough of to give me
spirits for what was before me. And now I
wanted nothing but a boat to furnish myself with
many things which I foresaw would be very ne-
cessary to me.

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was t
not to be had; and this extremity roused my
application. We had several spare yards, and

two or three large spars of wood, and a spare
top-mast or two in the ship: I flung as many of
them overboard as I could manage of their
weight, tying every one with a rope, that they
might not drift away; when this was done I went
down the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I
tied four of them fast together at both ends as
well asI could, in the form of a raft; and laying
two or, three pieces of plank upon them cross-
ways, I found I could walk upon them very well,
but that it was not able to bear any great weight,
the pieces being too light: so I went to work,
and with the carpenter's saw I cut a spare top-
mast into three lengths, and added them to my
raft, with a great deal of labour and pains; but
the hope to furnish myself with necessaries en-
couraged me to go beyond what I should have
been able to have done upon another occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to bear any
reasonable weight; my next care was what to
load it with, and how to preserve what I laid
upon it from the surf of the sea. I first laid all

the planks or boards upon it that I could get;
and having considered well what I most wanted,
I got three of the scamen's chests, which I had34 amen-Tears or

broken open and emptied, and lowered them
down upon my raft; the first. of these I tilled
with provisions, VIZ. bread, rice, three Dutch
cheeses, five pieces ofdried goat's tlcsh, which
we lixed much upon, and a little remainder of
European corn, which had been laid by for some.
fowls which we brought to sea with us, but the
fowls were killed; there had been some barley
and wheat together, but, to my great disappoint-
ment, [found that the rats had eaten and spoiled
it all. As for liquors, I found several cases of
bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were
some cordial waters, and in all about tire or six
gallons of arrack: these I stowed by themselves,
there being no need to put them in the chest, nor
any room for them. WhileI was doing this, I
found the tide began to flow, and I had the mor-
tification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat,
which I had left on shore upon the sand, swim-
ming away. This put me upon runnnaging for
clothes, of which I found enough, but took no
more than I wanted for present use, for I was
more intent upon other things, such as tools to
work with on shore: and after long searching
I found the carpenter's chest, which was indeed
a very useful prize to me, and much more val--
uable than a ship--load of gold would have been
at that time; I got it down to my raft without
losing time to look into it, for I knew in general
what it contained.

My next care. was for some ammunition and
arms. There were two towling pieces in the
great cabin, and" two pistols, thescl secured
first with some powder horns, and a small bag
of shot, and two rusty swords: with much search
I found two barrels of gun-powder dry and good,
and a third which had taken water; those two I
got to my raft with the arms. And now I thought
myself pretty well freighted, and began to con-
sider how I should get to shore with them, having
neither sail, oar, nor rudder, and the least gust
of wind would have oxverset all my navigation.

I had three encouragements: a smooth calm
sea; the tide rising and setting into the shore;
and what little wind there was blew me towards
the land. Having found two or three broken
oars belonging to the boat, and, besides the tools
which were in the chest, two saws, an axe, and a
hammer; and with this cargo I put to sea. For
a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very. well,
only that I found it drive a little distant from
the place where I had landed before: by which '
I perceived that there was some indraft of thc
water, and consequently I hoped to find some
creek or river there, which I might make use of
as a port to get to land with my cargo.

It proved to be a creek: and in endeavouring
to keep in the middle of the stream, I had like
to have suflcred a second shipwreck, which, had
it been so, would, I think verily, have broken my
heart; for, knowing nothing of the coast, my
raft ran aground at one end upon a shoal, and
my cargo was sliding off towards that end that.
was still afloat, I sct'my back against the chests,
to keep them in their places, but I could not.
thrust off the raft with all my strength, neither
durstI stir from the posture I was in ; but hold-
ingup the chests with all my might, stood in that
manner near half an hour, in which time the tide
flowing, my raft floated again; and driving up
higher, I found myself in the mouth ofa little
river, with land on both sides.

I observed a little core on the right shore of
the creek, to which with great pain and difficulty
I guided my raft, for I was not willing to be
driven too high up the river, hoping in time to
see some slip at sea, and therefore resolved to
place myself as me r the coast as I could. Hav-
ing got safe into the cove at high tide, though
my raft drew about a foot of water, I thrust her
upon a flat piece of ground, and there moored
her, by sticking my two broken oars into the
ground; one on one side near the end, and one
on the other side near the other end; and thus
I lay till the water cbbed away, and left my raft
and all my cargo safe on shore.

My next work was to view the country, and
seek a proper place for my habitation, and where
to stow my goods, to secure them from whatever
might happen. Where I was, Iyet knew not,
whether on a continent or on an island; whe--
ther inhabited or not inhabited; whether in
danger of wild beasts or not. There was a hill
not above amile from me, which rose up very
steep and high, and seemed to over-top some
other hills which lay as in a ridge from it north-
ward. 1 took one of the fowling pieces, and
one of the pistols, and a horn of powder; and
thus armed, [travelled for discovery up to the
top of that hill, where, after I had with great la-
bour and difficulty reached the top, I saw, to my
great affliction, that I was in an island environed
every way with the sea, no land to be seen, ex-
cept some rocks which lay a great way ofl', and

E
two small islands less than this I was cast on,
which lay about three leagues to the west.
lfound also that the island which I was in y 'as
barren, and, as I saw good reason to believe, uno
inhabited, except by wild beasts, of which, how-
ever, I saw none; yet I saw abundance offowls,
but knew not their kinds; neither when I killed
them, could I tell what was fit for food, and
what not. At my coming back, I shot at a great
bird which I saw sitting upon a. tree. on the side
of a great wood: I belie\e it was the first gun
that had been fired there since the creation of
the world. I had no sooner fired, but from all
parts of the wood there arose an inmnnerable
number of fowls of many sorts, making a con-
fused screaming and crying, every one accord~
ing to his usual note; but not one ofany kind
that I knew: as for the creature thatI killed, I
took it to bea kind of hawk, its colour and
beak resembling it, but it had no talons or claws
more. than common ; and its flesh was carrion

and good for nothing.

Contented with this discovery, I came back to
my raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on
shore, which took me up the rest ofthat day.
What to do with myself at night I knew not, nor
hnleed where to rest; for I was afraid to lie
down on the ground, not knowing but some
wild beast might devour me, though I afterwards
found there was really no need for those fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricadoed
myself around with chests and boards that I had

brought on shore, and made akind of" a hut for
my shelter, yet I dreaded to lie down, fearing
the attack of wild beasts; none however came
near me, and I passed the night in silence and in
safety.

0n the following day I again swam to the ship,
for I knew that the first storm that came would
dash her to pieces, and [resolved to get every
thing on shore that would be useful to me before
I attempted to fix my habitation.

I madea second raft, which Iloaded with a
good hammock and plenty of bedding, all the
men's clothes I could find, with sails and canvas,
and as much of the rigging, ropes, and twine, as
leould get; bags of nails, a screw-jack, two"
dozen of hatchets, and that most useful thing a
grind-stone.

I was under some apprehensions during my
absence from the land, that my provisions might

he devoured on shore; but. whenI came, "hand
no Sign of any visitor, only there sat a eieature
lilac: a wild--cat upon one of the chests, which
n hen I came towards it, ran away to a little dis-
tance, and then stood s-'ull: she. sat very com-
posedly, and lot-Led full in my time, as ifshe had
a mind to he acquainted with me. I presented
my gun at her, but as eke did not understand it,
she was perfectlynnc'mcerned, nor did she offer
to stir; npon \'IliCll I tossed her a hit of biscuit,
though I was not very free. of it, for my stoi'e was
not great. Ilowei er, I spared her a smallpiece,
and she went to it, smelled at it, and eat. it, and
looked (as if pleased) for more; but I thande
her, and could spare no more: so she marched
off.

Having got my second cargo on shore, I "eat
to "'Ul'k to m:-.ke a tent, with a sail and some
poles which I cut for that purpme; i..to this
tent I bwmght exery thing that I lulCW would
spoil, either with rain or the sun. And I piled all
the empty (asks and cheats in a circle round the
tent, to forth} it against any attacks of man or
beast. I then blocked up the. door of my tent
nith some boards, and spreading one of the beds
which I had brought on shore, I lay down with
my gun and pistols close beside me, and slept

very soundly all night.
After several other voyages to the ship, I had

the good fortune to find a large hogshead of his--
cuit, another of rum, a box of sugar, and a bar-
rel of fine flour. There were more provisions
on board, but they were all spoiled by the salt
water. I also on the same day discovered a
locker, with three razors, a large pair of scissars,
and a dozen knives and forks in it, and thirty-
six pounds in money. The money was now a
mere useless drug, but hoping it might hereafter
serve me, I wrapped it in canvas and took it
with me.

I had now been thirteen days on shore, and
had been eleven times on board the ship. In
the last visitI loaded my raft too heavily, and it

overset. By this accident] lost a quantity of
iron that would have been very useful to me,
but the planks and cables drifted on shore with

the tide.

Had the fine weather continued, I believe I
should have brought away the whole ship piece-
meal, but on the night of my last visit the wind
blew very hard all night, and when I left my hut

E 3
 

in the morning the ship was no more to be seen.
I was greatly affected by this event: it seemed
to me that I had lost my last friend, and was now
more deserted and alone than I had been before.
I sat down on the ground to gaze on the rock
where the ship had been, and tears run down my
cheeks, till my kind dog came. and fuwned upon
me. His caresses banished my melancholy
thoughts, and I rose up resolved to make the
best of my condition; and to this end, I began
to consider what sort of a dwelling I "should
construct, that would best secure me from the
attacks of savages, or wild beasts, if any such
should visit the island.

In determining on a situation I cpnsiilted ' '
several things which I found would be,proper "
for me; first, health and fresh-water; secondly,
shelter from the heat of the sun; thirdly, secu-
rity . from ravenous creatures, whether men or
beasts; fourthly, a view of the sea, that, if a
ship came in sight, I might not lose the chance
of deliverance;----my only hope and anxious ex-
pectation.

I fixed at length upon a small plain that sloped
towards the sea shore, and lay at the foot of a
high perpendicular rock, which was so steep thata.

nothing could come down to assault me from
above. Imade a half circle on the plain, round a
hollow part of the rock, into which I drove rows
ot'stakes, about five feet high, and standing about
six inches from each other. I then piled rows
of pieces of cable close to the stakes, and within
them I drove other stakes leaning against them
about two feet and a half high; and this fence,
which cost me much time, and excessive labour,
was so strong that nothing could break through
it. 1 made no door--way, but used, for enter-
ing my habitation, a short. ladder, which, when
I was on the top of my wall, 1 lifted over after
me, so that I thought myscli'completely fenced
in from all the world.

Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite per-
severance and difficulty, I carried all my riches,
provisions, ammunition and stores. lnext made
a large tent within my wall, and a smaller one
within that, and covered the whole with a tar-
paulin to secure them from the heavy rains;
and in the small tentI swung my hammock,
which had belonged to the mate of the ship,
and there lay very comfortably.

My next operation was to work my way into
the rock; and I soon made a cave behind my
tent, which served as a kitchen and cellar to
my house.

It cost me much labour before all these things
were brought to perfection. A storm of rain
falling at this time from a thick dark cloud,
accor.;panied with a sudden flash of lightning,
and after that a great clap of thunder, a thought
darted into my mind as swift as the lightning
itself--u' Oh, my powder l' My very heart sunk
within me, when l reflected that at one blast all
my powder might be destroyed; on which not
only my defence but the providing of my food, as
I thought, entirely depended. I was not anxious
about my own danger; though, had the powder
took fire, I had never known who had hurt me.

Such an impression did this make upon me,
that, after the storm was over, I laid aside all
my works, my building and fortifying, and ap-
plied myself to make bags and boxes to separate
my powder, in hopes that, whatever might hap-
pen, it might not all take fire at once; and to
keep it so apart, that it should not be possible
to make one part fire another. I finished this
work in about a fortnight: and I think my
powder, which was in all abouta hundred and
forty pounds weight, was divided in not less than
a hundred parcels. As to the barrel that had
been wet, ldid not apprehend any danger from
that, so I placed it in my new cave, which I
called my kitchen; and the restI hid up and
down in holes among the rocks, so that no wet
might come to it, marking very carefully where

I laid it.
In the interval of time, while all this was do-

ing, I went out once every day with my gun in
search of food. Isoon found that there were
plenty of goats in the island; but they were so
subtle and swift of foot, that I could not come
near them. After many fruitless attempts, I
observed, that if they were on the rocks and
I in the valley, they fled with far more preci-
pitation than when I descended from the rocks
when they were feeding in the valley. I there-
fore concluded that the position of their eyes
was such, that they could not readily see objects
above them. I found this opinion to be verified
when, having climbed the rocks immediately

above where they were feeding, I had a fair
mark, and shot. a she-goat which was giving

suck to a little kid beside her.

I was very much grieved to have shot the old-
one; and when I took her up to carry her home,
the poor little kid followed me, bleating for its
dam. I carried the kid over my enclosure, and
offered it food, intending to have bred it up
tame; but the poor thing would not eat, and
after two days it died.

The goat served me as meat along time; for I
eat very sparingly, and saved my provisions, es-
pecially my bread, as much asI possibly could.

I must now give some little account of myself,
and ,of my thoughts about living, which, it may
well be supposed, were not few. I had a dismal
prospect. of my condition; for, as Iwas not cast
away upon that island without being driven by a
violent storm quite out of the course of our in-
tended voyage, some hundreds of leagues out of
the ordinary course of the trade of mankind,
I'had great reason to consider it. as a deter-
mination of Heaven, that in this desolate place,
and in this desolate manner, I should end my
life. The tears would run plentifully down
my face when I made these reflections; and
sometimes I would expostulate with myself,
why Providence should thus completely ruin his
creatures, and render them absolutely miser~[gym n 'gfi

able, so without help abandoned, so entirely de-
pressed, that it would hardly be rational to be
thankful for such a life.

But something always returned swift upon me
to chem these thoughts, and to reprove me; and
particularly one day walking with my gun in my
hand by the sea-side, l was Very pensive upon
the subject of my present condition, when rea-
son, as it were, expostulated with me in this
ray: ' Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is
true; but, pray, rrmember, where are the rest of
you? Did not you come eleven of you into the
boat? Where are the ten? Wh) were notthe).r
sax'ed, and you lost? Why were you singled
out? Is it better to be here or there?' And
then I pointed to the sea. All evils are to be
considered with the good that is in them, and
with what attended aggravations they might
have.

Then it occurred to me again, how well I
was furnished for my subsistence, and what
would have been my case if it had not happened,
that the ship floated from the place where she
first struck, and was driven so near to the shore,
that [had time to get all these things out of her.
What would have been my case, if I had been
obliged to live in the condition in which Iat first!
came on shore, without the necessaries of hfe,
or any means to procure them! Particularly,
said I, aloud, what could I have done without
a gun; without ammunition; without any tools
to work with; without clothes, bedding, a tent,
or any manner of cmeriug? And that nowI
had all there in a sufiicient quantity, and was in
a fair way to provide myself in such a manner
as to live without my gun, when my ammunition
was spent.

And now, being to enter into a melancholy
relation ot'a scene of silent life, such, perhaps,
as was never heard of in the world before, I
shall take it from its beginning, and continue it
in its order. It "as, by my account, the 30th
of September when I first set foot upon this hor-
rid island; when the sun, being to us, in its au-
tumnal equinox, was almost just oyer my head;
for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be in
the latitude of!) degrees '22 minutes north of the
line.

After I had been there about ten or twelve
days, it came into my thoughts that I should
lose my reckoning of time for want of books and

pen and ink, and should even forget the sabbath
days from the working days; but to prevent this,
Icut it with my knife upon a large post, in capi-
tal letters; and making it into a great cross, I
set it up on the shore where I first landed, viz.
I came on shore lzcrc on the 301/; of September,
1659. Upon the sides ofthissquare post, I cut
every day a notch nith my knife, and every se-
venth notch was as long again as the rest, and
every first day of the month as long again as
that. long one; and thus I kept my calendar, or
weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.
In the next place we are to observe, that among
the many things which I brought out of the ship
in the several voyages which I made to it, I got
several things of less value, but not at all less use-
ful to me, which I omitted setting down before;
as, in particular, pens, ink, and paper; several
parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and
carpenter's keeping; three or four compasses,
some mathematical instruments, dials, perspec-
tives, charts, and books of navigation; all which
I huddled together, whether I might want them
or not: also I found three very good bibles,
which came to me in my cargo from England,
and which I had packed up among my things;
some Portuguese books also, and among them
I"
two or three popish prayer books, and several
other books, all whichI carefully secured. And
I must not forget that we had in the ship a dog
and two cats, of whose eminent history I may
have occasion to say something in its place; for
I carried both the cats with me; and as for the
dog, he jumped out of the ship himself, and
swam on shore to me the day afterI went on
shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty ser--
vant to me for many years. I wanted nothing
that he could do for me, nor any company that
he could make up to me: I only wished to have
him talk to me, but that was impossible.

I now found I wanted many things, notwith~
standing all that I had amassed together; and of
these, that of ink was one; as also, a spade,
pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or remove the earth;
needles, pens, and thread. As for linen, I soon
learned to want that without much difficulty.

This want of tools made every work I undertook
go on heavily, and it was near a whole year before
I had entirely finished my pale, or surrounded my
habitation. The piles, or stakes, which were as

heavy as [could well lift, were a long time in
cutting and preparing in the woods, and more
by far in bringing home; so that [spent some-<<
times two days in cutting and bringing home.
one of those posts, and a third day in driving it
into the ground: driving these posts, or piles,
was a very laborious and tedious work indeed.

But what need had I to be concerned with the
tediousness of any thingI had to do, seeing I

had time enough to do it in; nor had I any other
employment if that had been over, at least, that

I could foresee; except the ranging the island to
seek for food, whichl did more or less every
day.

I now began to consider seriously my conditi-
on, and the circumstances which I was reduced
to: and I drew up the state ofmy affairs in writ-
ing, not so much to leave them to any that were
to come after me, (for I was likely to have but few
heirs,) but to relieve my thoughts from daily 110--
ring upon them and afllicting my mind; and as
my reason began now to master my despondency,
and to set the good against the evil, that I might
have something to distinguish my case from '
worse; I stated very impartially, like debtor and
creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against the mi-
series I sufi'ered; thus :---
EVIL.

I am cast upon a horri-
b'le desolate island, void
of all Jiope of recovery.

I am singled out and se-
parated, as it were, from
all the world, to be mi-
serable.

I am divided from man-
kind; a solitary one, ba-
nished from all human so-
ciety.

I have no clothes to
cover me.

I am without any de-
fence, or means to resiSt
any violence of man or
beast.

I- have no soul to speak
to or to relieve me.

GOOD.

But [am alive, and not
drowned, as all my ship's
company were.

But I am singled out too
from all the ship's crew to
be spared from death; and
HE that miraculously sav-
ed me from death, can deli.
ver me from this condition.

But I am not starved
and pcrishing on a barren
place, atfording no sus-
tenance.

But I am in a hot climate,
where, it'I had clothes, I
could hardly wear them.

But I am cast on an is-
land where I see no wild
beasts to hurt me, as I saw
on the' coast of Africa :
and what if I had been
shipwrecked there!

But God wonderfully
sent the ship in near
enough to the shore, I have
gotten out so many neces-
sary things as will enable
me to supply myself even
as long as I live.
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted tes-

timony that there was scarcely any condition in
the world so miserable, but there was something
negative, or something positive, to be thankful
for in it; and let this stand as a direction, from
the experience of the most miserable of all con-
ditions in this world, that we may always find in
it something to comfort ourselves from, and to
set in the description of good and evil on the
credit side of the account.

Having now brought my mind a little to relish
my condition, I came by imperceptible degrees
into that state of contentment and resignation,
that my labour was no longer a cheerless'toil; but
I looked with pleasure on the many comforts and
conveniences which my labour produced for me.

Having finished my~dwelling, I applied myself
to make a table and chair, the want of which was
a daily inconvenience to me. I was particularly
awkward when I first began this work, and a skil-
ful carpenter would have laughed to see the
clumsy manner in which I handled my saw, adze,
and hatchet; yet, by application and contrivance,
I found at last that I overcame all my difficulties;
and made not only my chair and table, but
shelves, and many other conveniences, which

F 3
made my tent not only more commodious, but
gave it that look oforder, neatness, and arrange-
ment, which is at all times so pleasing to the eye,
whether in a cave on a desert island, or in a
splendid palace.

My cave seemed now like a general magazine
of all useful things ready to the hand; and I
rejoiced heartily to find my stock of necessary
stores even larger than I had at first supposed
them to be. a

My table and chair were a great solace. to me;
and every day, as long as my ink lasted, I laept
a journal of my occupations, my observations,
and ofevely thing that befel me; of which jour-
:al I shall give a copy, though in it will he told
all these particulars over again.

THE JOURNAL.

September 30, 16-39. I, poor miserable Ro-
binson Crusoe, being shipwrecked during a.
dreadful storm in the oiling, came on shore on
this dismal, unfortunate island, which I call
.7726 Island of DeSpaz'r; all the rest of the ship's

company being drowned, and myself almost
dead.nonmsoN (meson. 55

All the rest of that day I spent in afllicting
myself at the dismal circumstances I was brought
to, viz. I had neither food, house, clothes, wea-
pon, nor place to fly to; and, in despair of any
relief, saw nothing but death before me: either
that I should be devoured by wild beasts, mur-
dered by savages, or starved to death for want
of food. At the approach of night I slept in a
tree, for fear of wild creatures; but slept soundly,
though it rained all night.

October 1. In the morningl saw, to my great
surprise, the ship had floated with the high tide,
and was driven on shore again much nearer the
island, this was some comfort, as I hoped if
the wind abated I might. get on board, and get
some food and necessaries out of her for my re-
lief, which I did. I went upon the sand as near
to the ship asI could, and then swam on board.
This day also it continued raining, though with
no wind at all. I

From the lst to the 14th was entirely spent in
making several voyages to get all I could out (if
the ship, which I brought on shore every tide,
upon rafts. Much rain also in these days,
though with some intervals of fair weather: but

it seems this was the rainy season.
Oct. 20. I overset my raft and all the goods
I had got upon it; but, being in shoal water, and
the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many
of them when the tide was out.

Oct. 25. It rained all night and all day, with
some gusts of wind; during which time the ship
broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder
than before, and was no more to be seen, except
the wreck of her, and that only at. low water. I
spent this day in covering and securing the goods
~which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil
them.

Oct. 26. I walked about the shore almost all
day, to find out a place to fix my habitation;
greatly concerned to secure myself against any at-
tuck in the night, either from wild beasts or men.
Towards night I fixed upon a proper place under
a rock, and marked out a semicircle for my en-
campment, which I resolved to strengthen with a
work, wall, or fortification, made of double piles,
lined within with cable, and without with turf.

From the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard
in carrying all my goods to my new habitation,
though some part of the time it rained exceed-
ingly hard.

The 3lst in the morning, I went out into the
island with my gun to see for some food, and
discover the country, when I killed a she-goat,
and her kid followed me home, which afterwards
died, because it would not feed.

November 1. I set up my tent under a rock,
and lay there for the first night, making it as
large as I could, with stakes driven in to swing
my hammock upon. The next day I set up all
my chests and boards, and the pieces of timber
which made my raft, and with them formed a
fence round me, a little within the place I had
"marked out for my fortification.

Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed
two fowls, like ducks, which were very good.
In the afternoon, went to work to make my
table. The next morning I began to order my
times of work, of going out with my gun, time
of sleep, and time of diversion; viz. every
morning I walked out with my gun for two or
three hours, if it did not rain; then employed
myself to work till about ten; then eat what
Iliad to live on; and from twelve to two I lay
down to sleep, the weather being excessively
hot; and then in the evening to work again.
The working part of this day and the next were

wholly employed in making my table, for I was58 anvsn'wans or

yet but a very sorry workman, though time and ne-
cessity made me a complete natural mechanic soon
after, as I believe they would do any one else.
.. Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun
and my dog, and killed a wild cat, her skin
pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing:
every creature I killed I took off their skins .
and preserved them. Coming back by the sea-
shore, Isaw many sorts of fowls, whose species
I did not know; but was surprised and almost
frighted with two or three seals, which, while I
was gazing at, not well knowing what they were,
got into the sea, and escaped from me for that
time. '

Nov. 6. After mymorning walk, I went to
work with my table again and finished it, though.
not to my liking; nor was it long before I learn.
ed to mend it. I

Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair wea-'
ther. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and a part of
the 12th (for the 11th'was Sunday) I took wholly
up to make me a chair, and, with much ado
brought. it to a tolerable shape, but never to
please me: and even in the making, I pulled it
to pieces several times. --

Nov. 13. This day 1t rained, which refieshed

'\
and exceedingly cooled the earth; but it was
accompanied with terrible thunder and lightning,
which frighted , me dreadfully for fear of my
powder.

As soon as it was over, I resolved to separate
my stock of powder into as many little parcels
as possible, that it might not be in danger.

Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent
in making little square chests or boxes, which
might hold about a pound, or two pounds, at
most, of powder; and so putting the powder in,
I stowed it in places as secure and remote from
one another as possible. On one of these three
days I killed a large bird that was good to eat,
but I knew not what to call it.

Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind
my tent into the rock, to make room for my
further conveniences. Three things I wanted
exceedingly for this work, VIZ. a pick--axe, a
shovel, and a wheel-barrow, or basket; so I
desisted from my work and began to consider
how to supply these wants, and make me some
tools. As for a pick-axe, I made use of the iron
crows, which were proper enough, though heavy :
but the next thing was a shovel or spade; this
was so absolutely necessary, that indeedI could
do nothing effectually without it; but what kind
of one to make I knew not.

Nov. 18. The next day, in searching the
woods, I found a tree of that wood, or one like
it, which in the Brasils they call the iron-tree,
for its exceeding hardness; of this, with great
labour, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a
piece, and brought it home too, with difliculty
enough, for it was very heavy.

The excessive hardness of the wood, made me
a long while employed upon this machine; for
I worked it effectually by little and little into
the form of a shovel or spade, the handle exactly
shaped like ours in England, only that the broad
part having no iron shod upon it at the bottom,
it would not last me so long; however, it served
well enough for the use which I had occasion to
put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made
after that fashion, or so long in makino.

I was still deficient of a basket, or wheel-bar-
row; a basket I could not make by any means,
having no such things as twigs that would bend,
-to make wicker ware, at least none yet found
out; and as to the wheel-barrow, I fancied I
could make all but the wheel, but that I had no
notion of, neither didI know how to go about
it; besides, I had no possible way to make the
iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the wheel
to run in, so I gave it over; and for carrying
away the earth which I dug out of the cave, I
made me a thing like a hod which the labourers
carry mortar in, when they serve the bricklayers.

This was not so difficult to me as the making
of the shovel; and yet this, and the shovel, and
the attempt which I made in vain to make a
wheel -barrow took me up no less than four days,
excepting my morning walk with my gun, which
I seldom neglected; and very seldom failed to
bring home something to eat.

Nov. 23. My other work having now stood .
still, because of my making these tools; when
they were. finished I went on, and working every
day, as my strength and time allowed, I spent
eighteen days entirely in widening and deepen-
ing my cave, that it might hold my goods com-
modiously.

During all this time Iworked to make this
room or cave spacious enough to accomodate
me as a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a
dining-room, and a cellar: as for my lodging,
I kept the tent, except that sometimes in the
wet season of the year, it rained so hard that I

G
could not keep myself dry, which caused me
afterwards to cover all my'place withinmy pale
with long poles in the form of rafters, leaning
against the rock, and load them with flags and
large leaves of trees like a thatch.

December 10. I began now to think my
cave or vault finished, when on a sudden (it
seemsI had made it too large) a great quantity

of earth fell down from the top and one side,
so much that in short it fi-ighted me, and not
without reason too; for if I had been under it
. I had never wanted a grave-digger. Upon this
disaster I had a great deal of work to do over
again; for I had the loose earth to carry out,
and which was of more importance, I had the
ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no
more would come down.

Dec. 11. This day I went to work with it
accordingly, and got two shores or posts pitched
upright to the top, with two pieces of boards,
across over each post; this I finished the next
day; and setting more posts up with boards,
in about a week more I had the roof secured;
and the posts standing in rows, served me for
partitions to part off my house.

Dec. 17. From this day to the twentieth I
placed shelves and knocked up nails in the
posts to hang every thing up that could be hung
up; and now I began to be in some order within
doors. .

Dec. 20. Now I carried every thing into the
cave, and began to furnish my house and fixed
up some pieces of boards like a dresser, to or--
der my victuals upon, but boards began to be

very scarce with me; also I. made me another
table.

Dec. 24 and 25. Much rain; no stirring
out.

Dec. 26. No rain, and the earth much cooler
than before, and pleasanter.

Dec. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed
another so that I caught it, and led it home in
a string; when I had it home, I bound and
splintered up its leg, which was broken. N..B. I
took such care of it that it lived, and the leg
grew well, and as strong as ever; by nursing
it so long it grew tame, and fed upon the little
green before my door, and would not go away.

This was the first time that I entertained a
'thought of breeding up some tame creatures,
that I might have food when 'my powder and
shot was all spent.

G 2
Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great heats, and no
breezes; so that there was no stirring abroad,
except in the evening for food. This time I
spent in putting all my things in order within
doors.

January 1. Very hot still; but [went abroad
early and late with my gun, and'lay still in the
middle of the day. This evening going further
into the vallies, which lay towards the centre of
the island, I found there was plenty of goats,
though exceedingly shy, and hard to come at;
however, I resolved to try if I could not bring
my dog to hunt them down.

Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next day I went
out with my dog, and set him upon the goats;
but I was mistaken, for they all faced about
upon him; and he knew his danger too well,
for he would not come near them.

Jan. 3. I began my fence, or wall, which,
being still jealous of my being attacked by some-
body, I resolved to make very thick and strong.
N. B. This wall being described before, I pur-

posely omit what was said in the journal. It

is sufiicient to observe, that I was no less time
than from the third of January to the four-

teenth of April, working, finishing, and per,
fecting this wall, though it was no more than
twenty--four yards in length; being a half-
circle from one place in the rock to another
place about eight yards from it; the door of
the cave being in the centre behind it.

All this time I worked very hard, the rains

hindering me many days, nay, sometimes weeks
together; but I believed I should never be per-

fectly secure till this wall was finished. It is

scarcely credible what inexpressible labour
every thing was done with; especially the bring-
ing piles out of the woods and driving them into
the ground, for I made them much bigger than
I needed to have done.

When this wall was finished, and the outside.
double fenced with a turf-wall raised up close

to it, I persuaded myself that if any people
were to come on shore there, they would not
perceive any thing like a habitation; and it was
very well I did so, as may be observed- hereafter
upon a remarkable occasion.

During this time I made my rounds in the
woods for game every day when the rain per-
mitted me, and made frequent discoveries in
these walks of something or other to my ad-
vantage; particularly I found a kind of wild

G 3
pigeons, that built not, as wood-pigeons, in a
tree, but rather, as house-pigeons, in the holes
of the rocks; and taking some young ones, I
endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did
so; but when they grew older they all flew
away, which perhaps was for want of feeding
them, for Ihad nothing to give them. How-
ever, I frequently found their nests, and got
their young ones, which were very good meat.

And now, in the managing of my household
affairs, I found myself in want of many things,
which Ithouglit at first it was impossible for
me to make. For instance, I could never make
a cask to be hooped; I had a small runlet or
two, but I could never arrive to the capacity of
making one by them, though I spent many
weeks about it: Icould neither put in the heads
or join the staves so true to one another as to
make them hold water, therefore I gave that
attempt over.

There was yet another material want unsup-

plied, namely, candles: Idid at length find a
substitute for them. When Ikilled a goat I

saved thg tallow, and put it into a little dish
made of clay and baked in the sun. I put a

wick of oakum into the tallow; and had a lamp
which gave me light enough to read, write, or
work by, though it did not yield so clear and
steady a flame as that of a candle.

It happened, when I was arranging my stores
on the shelves, thatI found a bag which had
once been filled with corn for the fowls we had
on board the ship. There appeared to be only
a few dry husks remaining, which I shook out,
intending to fill the bag with gun-powder. It
was a little before some great rains which fell,
thatI emptied these husks by the side of the
rock; and abouta month afterwards, when I did
not so much as recollect what I had thrown
away there, I saw some green stalks shooting
Out of the earth; and perfectly astonished was
I, in a little time, to see these shoots ripen into
ten or twelve ears of English barley.

I can scarcely express the agitation of my
mind at this sight. Hitherto] had looked upon
the actions of this life, no otherways than only
as the events of blind chance and fortune; but
now the appearance of this barley, flourishing
in a barren soil; and my ignorance in not con-
ceiving how it could come there, made me con-

clude that miracles were not yet ceased: nay,
I even thought that God had appointed it to
grow there without any seed, purely for my sus-
tenance in this miserable and desolate island.
And, indeed, such great effect bad this upon me,
that it often made me melt into tears, through
a grateful sense of God's mercies; and the greater
still was my thankfulness, when I perceived about
this little field of barley some rice stalks also
wonderfully flourishing._

Thus pleased in mind, I concluded there must

be more com in the island, and therefore made

adiligent search narrowly among the rocks; but
not being able to find any, on a sudden it came
into my mind how I had shaken the husks of
corn out of the bag, and then my admiration

ceased, with my gratitude to the Divine Being,
as thinking it was but natural, and not to be
conceived a miracle; though, even the man-
ner of its preservation, might have made me

own it as a wonderful event of God's kind pro:
vidence.

It was about the latter end of June when the
ears of this corn ripened, which I laid up very
carefully, together with twenty or thirty stalks
of rice, expecting I one day should reap the
fruits of my labour; yet four years were ex-
pired before I would allow myself to eat any
bread, or rather food; for I found ways to cook
it up without baking. '

'But to return to my journal.

I worked excessively hard three or four
months to get my wall done; and the 14th of
April I closed it up, contriving to go into it,
not by a door, but 0v er the wall by a ladder,
that there might be no sign on the outside of
my habitation.

April 16. I finished the ladder; so I went
up by it to the top, and then-pulled it up afier
me, and let it down on the inside. This was
a complete enclosure to me; for within I had ,
room enough, and nothing could come at me
from without, unless it could first mount my
wall. '

But what .do all human pains and industry"
avail, if the blessing of God do not crown our
labours? Or " who can stand before the Al--
mighty, when he stretcheth forth his arm?"

The very next day after this wall was finished
I had almost had all .my la'bour overthroWn at

once, and myself killed. The case was thus:
as I was busy in the inside it, behind my. tent,
just in the entrance into my cave, on a sudden I
{Ound the earth come tumbling down from the-
roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill
over my head, and two of the posts I had set up

in the cave cracked in a most frightful manner.

Iwas heartily scared; but thought nothing of
what was really the cause, only thinking that
the top of my cave was falling in, as some of
it had done before; and, for fear I should be
buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder; and,
not thinking myself safe there neither I got over
my wall, for fear of the pieces of the hill, which
I expected might roll down upon me. I was
no sooner stept down upon the firm ground than
I plainly felt it was a terrible earthquake, for
the ground I stood upon shook three times in
about eight minutes, with three such shocks as
would have overturned the strongest building
that could be supposed to have stood on the
earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock,
which stood about half a mile from me next the
sea, fell down with such a terrible noise as I
never heard in all my life. I perceived also
that the very sea was put into a violent motion

by it; and believe the ' shocks were stronger
under the water than onfi'the island.

I was so amazed with the thing itself, having
never felt the like, or conversed with any onenonmson cnuson. 71

who had, that I was like one dead or stupified ;
and the motion of the earth made my stomach

sick, like one that was tossed at sea; but the
noise of the falling of the rock, roused me from
the stupified condition I was in, andI thought
of nothing then but the hill falling upon my
tent, and all my household goods, and burying
all at once; and this sunk my very soul within
me a second time. _

Afier the third shock was over, and I felt no
' more for some time,- I began to take courage;
and yet I had not heart enough to get over my
wall again, for fear of being buried alive; but
sat still upon the ground, greatly cast down and
disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All this
while I had not the least serious religious
thought, nothing but the common '6 Lord have
mercy upon me!" and when it was over, that
went away too.

\Vhile I sat thus, I found the air. overcast
and grown cloudy, as if it would rain; and in

less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful
hurricane; the sea was all on a sudden covered

over with foam and froth, the shore was covered
with the breach of the water, the trees were
torn up by the roots, and a terrible storm it
was. This held about three hours, and then
began to abate; and in two hours more it was
calm, and began to rain very hard.

All this whilel sat upon the ground very much
terrified and dejected, when on asudden it came
into my mind that these winds and rain being
the consequence of the earthquake, the earth-
quake itself was spent and over, and lmight
venture into my care again. With this thought
my spirits began to rerive, and the rain also
helping to persuade me, I went in, and sat down
in my tent; but the rain was so \iolent that my
tent was ready to be beaten down with it, and I
was forced to go into my cave, though very much
afraid and uneasy for fenr it should fall on my head.

This \iolent rain forced me to a new work,

viz. to cut a hole through my new fortification
like a sink to let water go out, which would
else have drowned my care. After I had been
in my cave some time, and found no more shocks
of the earthquake follow, I began to be more
composed; and now to support my spirits, which
indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little
store, and took a small sup of rum, which how-
ever I did then, and always very sparingly,
knowing I could have no more when that was
gone.

It continued raining all that night, and great

part of the next day, so that I could not stir
abroad; but my mind being more composed,
I began to think ofwhatl had best do; con-

eeiving that if the island was subject to these
earthquakes, there would be no living for me in
a cave, but I must consider of building me some
little hut in an open place, which I might sur-
round with a wall as I had done here, and so
make myself secure from wild beasts or men;
but concluded, if I staid where Iwas, I should
certainly, one time or other, be buried alive.
With these thoughts I resolved to remove my
tent from the place where it stood, which was
just under the hanging precipice of the hill, and
which,if it should be shaken again,would certainly
fall upon my tent. And I spent the two next
days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in con-
triving where and how to remove my habitation.
The fear of being swallowed up alive, made
me that I never slept in quiet; and yet the
apprehension of lying abroad without any fence
was almost equal to it: but still when I looked

yr
about, and saw how every thing was put in order,
how pleasantly concealed I was, and how safe
from danger, it made me very loath to remove.
In the mean time it occurred to me, that'it _
would require a vast deal of time to do this,-
and that I must be contented to run the venture
where I was, till I had formed a camp for my-
self, and had secured it so as to remove it. So
with this resolution I composed myself for a
time, and resolved that I would go to work with
all speed to build me a wall with piles and
cables, &c. in a circle as before, and set my
tent up in it when it was finished; but that I
' Would venture to stay where I was till it was
finished and fit to remove into. This was the 2lst.

April 22. The next morning I began to con-
sider of means to put this resolve into execution,

but I was at a great loss about my tools; I had
three large axes, and abundance of hatchets,

(for we carried the hatchets for traffic with the
Indians,) but with much chopping and cutting
knotty 'hard wood, they were full of notches;
and though I had a grind-stone, I could not turn

it and grind my tools too. At length I contrived
a kind of wheel with a string, to turn it with my

foot, that I might have both my hands at liberty.
II had never seen such a thing in England, or at
least not to take notice how it was done, though
since I have observed it is very common there;
besides that, my grindstone was very large and
heavy. This machine cost me a full week's \
work to bring it to perfection.

April 28-, 29. These two whole days I took
up in grinding my tools, my machine for turning
my grindstone performing very well.

April 30. Having perceived my bread had
been low a great while, now] took a survey of
it, and reduced myself to one biscuit-cake a day,
which made my heart very heavy.

May 1. In the morning looking towards the
sea-side, the tide being low, I saw something lie

on the shore bigger than ordinary; and when
I came to it, it proved to be a small barrel, and

two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship,
which were driven on shore by the late hurri- -
cane; and looking towards the wreck itself, I
thought it seemed to lie higher out of the water
than it used to do. On examining the band, I
found it was a barrel of gun-powder, but it had
taken water, and the powder was caked as hard
as a stone; however, I rolled it further on shore

for the present.
H 2 -
When I came down to the ship, I found it"
strangely removed; the forecastle, which lay
before buried in sand, was heaved up at least six
feet; and the stern, which was broke to pieces,
and parted from the rest by the force of the sea,
soon after I had left rummaging her, was tossed
up, as it were, and cast on one side, and the sand

was thrown so high on that side next her stern,
that where there was a great place of water be--
fore, so that I could not come within a quarter
of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I could
now walk quite up to her when the tide was out;
I was surprised with this at first, but soon con-

cluded it must have been done by the earth-
quake.

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the
design of removing my habitation; and I busied
myself that day in searching whether I could
make any way into the ship; but I found no-
thing was to be expected of that kind, for that
all the inside of the ship was choaked up with

sand.

May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece
of a beam through, which I thought held the up-
per part or quarter-deck together, and when I
cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well as
'I could from the side which lay highest; but the
tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for
that time. \

May 4. I went a fishing, but caught not one
fish that I durst eat of, till I was weary of my
sport; when just going to leave off, I caught a
young dolphin. I made a long line of rope-
yarn, but I had no books, yetI frequently caught
fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which
I dried in the sun, and eat them dry.

May 5 to 14. I went every day to the wreck,
and got a great deal of pieces of timber and

, board, or plank, and two or three hundred weight
of iron.

May 15. I carried two hatchets to try if I

. could cut a piece off the roll of lead by placing
the edge of one hatchet, 'and driving it in with
the other; but as it lay about a foot and a half
in the water, I could not make any blow to drive

the hatchet.

May 16. It had blowed hard in the night;
and the wreck appeared more broken by the
force of the. water; but I staid so long in the
woods to get pigeons for food, that the tide pre-
vented me going to the wreck that day.

- May 24. Every day to this I worked on the
n 3 '
wreck, and with hard labour Iloosened some
things so much with the crow, that the first blow-
ing tide several casks floated out, and two of the-
seamen's chests; but the wind blowingfrom the-
shore, nothing came to land that day but pieces
of timber, and a hogshead which had some Bra-
sil pork in it, but the salt water and sand had
spoiled it.

I continued this work every day to the 15th
of June, except the time necessary to get food,
which I always appointed, during this part of
my employment, to be when the tide was up,
thatI might be ready when it was ebbed out:
and by this time I had gotten timber and plank,
and iron- vork, enough to have built a good
boat, if I had known how; and also I got at
several times, and in several pieces, near a hun-
dred weight of sheet lead.

June 16. Going down to the sea-side, I found
a large tortoise, or turtle. This was the firstl
had seen, which, it seems was only my misfor-
tune, not any defect of the place, or scarcity;
for bad I happened to be on the other side of
the island, [might have had hundreds of them
every day, as I found afterwards.

June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle ; I found"
in her threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me.
at that time the most savoury and pleasant that
I ever tasted in my life, having had no_flesh,'but
of goatsand fowls, since I landed in this horrid
place.

June 18. Rained all day, and I stayed within.
I thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I
was something chilly, which I knew was not
usual in that latitude. .

. June 19. Very ill and shivering, as if the
weather had been cold.

June 20. No rest all night; violent pains in
my head, and feverish.

June 21. Very ill: frighted almost to death
with the apprehensions of my sad condition--to
be sick and no help! Prayed to God for the
first time since the storm ofl' Hull; but scarcely
knew what I said or why, my thoughts being all

confused.
June 22. A little better, but under dreadful

apprehensions of sickness.

June 23. Very had again; cold and shiver-
ing, and then a violent head-ache; bu on the
24th I was much better.

June 25. An ague very violent; the fit held
me seven hours; cold fit and hot,' with faint
sweats after it. '

June 26. Better; and having no victuals to
eat, took my gun, but found myself very weak;
however, I killed a she-goat, and with much
difficulty got it home, and boiled some of it,
and eat; I would fain have stewed it, and made

some broth, but had no pot.

June 27. The ague again so violent, that I
lay in bed all day, and neither eat nor drank.
I was ready to perish for thirst, but so weak
I had no strength to stand up, or to get myself
any water to drink.

And now when I began to be sick, and a dis- -
tinct view of the miseries of death came to place
itself before me; when my spirits began to sink
under the burden of a strong distemper, and
nature was exhausted with the violence of the
fever; conscience, that had slept so long, awak-
ened, and I began to reproach myself with my
past life, in which I had so evidently, by uncom-
mon wickedness, provoked the justice of God to
deal with me in so vindictive a manner.

These reflections oppressed me for the second
or third day of my distemper; and in the via.
lence as well of the fever as of the dreadful re-
proaches of my conscience, extorted some words
from me like praying to God, though I cannot
say they were either a prayer attended with de-
sires or with hopes. it was rather the voice of
mere fright and distress. My thoughts were con-
fused; the convictions great upon my mind; and

the horror of dying 1n such a miserable condition,
raised vapours into my head with the mere ap-
prehensions: and in these hurries of my soul I
knew not what my tongue might express; but
it was rather exclamation; such as, Lord, what
a' miserable creature am I! If I should be
sick, I shall certainly die for want of help--and
what will become of me! Then the tears burst

out of my eyes,- and I could say no more for a
good while.

In this interval the good advice of my father
came into my mind, which I had so wickedly re-
jected, viz. That if I did take this foolish step,
God would not bless me; and I would have
leisure hereafier to reflect upon having neglected

his counsel, when there might be none to assist
' 1n my recovery. Now, said I, aloud, my dear
father's words are come to pass--God' 3 justice
has overtaken me, and I have none to help on
hear me! I rejected the voice of Providence,
which had mercifully put me in a posture, or
station of life, wherein I might have been happy
and easy; but I would neither see it myself, nor
learn to know the blessing of it from my parents.
I left my parents to mourn over my folly, and
now I am left to mourn under the consequences
of it. I refused their help and assistance, who
would have lifted me into the world, and would
have made every thing easy to me; and now
I have difficulties to struggle with too great for
even nature itself to support, and no assistance,
no help, no comfort, no advice. Then I cried
out, Lord, be my help, for I am in great
distress!

This was the first prayer, if I may call it so,
that I had made for many years.' But I return
to myjournal.

June 28. Having been somewhat. refreshed
with sleep, I rose to get something to refresh
and support myself; and the first thing I did,
I- filled a large square case bottle with water,
and set it upon my table, in reach of my bed;
and to take off the chill of the water, I put
about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and
mixed them together: then I got me a piece of
the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but
could eat only very little; I walked about, but
was very weak, and withal very sad and heavy-
hearted with the thoughts of my miserable con-
dition, dreading the return of my distemper the
next day.

At night Imade my supper of three of the
turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and
eat, as we call it, in the shell; and this was the
first bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing
to, that I could remember, in my whole life.

AfterI had eaten I tried to walk, but found
myself so weak that Icould hardly carry the
gun; (for I never went out without that) so I
, went but a little way, and sat down upon the
ground, looking out upon the sea, which was
just before me, and very calm and smooth. As
I sat here, some such thoughts as these occurred
to me:--

What is this earth and sea of whichI have
seen so much? Whence is it produced? And
what am I and all other creatures, wild and
tame, human and brutal--whence are we? Sure-
ly we are all made by some secret power, who
formed the earth and sea, the air and sky; and
who is that?
Then it followed most naturally--It is God
that has made it all! Well, but (then- it came
on strangely) if God have made all these things,
he guides and govems them all, and all things
that concern them; for the power that could
make all things, must certainly have power to
guide and direct them.

If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit
of his works, either without his knowledge or
appointment: and if nothing happens without his
knowledge, he knows that [am here, and am in
this dreadful condition; and if nothing happens
without his appointment, he has appointed all
this to befal me.

Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict
any of these conclusions; and therefore it rested
upon me wlth the greater force, that it must
needs be that God has appointed all this to be-

fal me; that I was brought to this miserable cir-
cumstance by his direction, he having the sole
power not of me only, but of every thing that
happened in the world. Immediately it followed,

Why has God done this to me '2 What have
Idone to be thus used? My conscience pre-
sently checked me in that enquiry, as if I had
glasphemed; and methought it spoke to me like.
a voice, ' "Watch! Dost thou ask what thou
hast done? Look back upon a dreadfully mis-
speut life, and ask thyself what thou hast not
done! Ask, why it is thou wast not long
ago destroyed! Why wast thou not drowned
in Yarmouth roads; killed in the fight, when
when the ship was taken by the Sallee mau 0f\ 'ar;
devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of
Africa; or drowned here, when all the crew
perished but thyself? Dost thou ask, what have
I done !'

I was struck dumb with these reflections, as
one astonished; and had not a word to say, no
not to answer myself; but rose up pensive
and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went
up over my wall, as if I had been going to bed ;
but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had
no inclination to sleep; so I sat down in my
chair and lighted my lamp, for it began to be
dark. Now as the apprehension of the return of
my"(listemper terrified me very much, it occurred
to my thoughts, that the Brasilians took no phy-
sic but their tobacco for almost all distempers,
and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of
the chests which was quite cured, and some also
that was green and not quite cured. I

I
I went, directed by heaven no doubt; for in
this chest I found a cure both for soul and
body;I opened the chest, and found what I
looked for, viz. the tobacco; and as the few
books I had saved lay there too, I took out one
of the Bibles which I mentioned before, and

which to this time I had not found leisure or
so much as inclination to look into; I say I

took it out and brought both that and the to-
bacco with me to the table.

What use to make of the tobacco, I knew not
exactly, but I tried several experiments with it:
I first took a piece of a leaf and chewed it in
my mouth, which at first almost stupified me;
the tobacco being green and strong; then I
took some and steeped it an hour or two in
some rum, and resolved to take a dose of it
when I lay down; and lastly, I burnt some upon
a pan of coals, and held my nose close over the
smoak as long as I could bear it, as well for the

heat .as almost for sufi'ocation.

In the interval of this operation, I took up the
Bible and began to read, but my head was too
much disturbed with the tobacco to bear read-
ing, at least that time; only having opened the
book casually, _ the first words that occurred to
me were these--" Call on me in the day of
trouble, andI will deliver thee, and thou shalt
glorify me."

The words were very apt to my case, and
made some impressions upon my thoughts at the
time of reading them, though not so much as

they did afterwards; for, as to being delivered,
the word had no meaning, as I may say, to me;
the thing was so remote, so impossible in my
apprehension of things, that I began to say as
the children of Israel did, when they were pro-
mised flesh to eat, " Can God spread a table in
the wilderness?" So I began to say, " Can God
himself deliver me from this place 2'" And as it
was not for many years that any hope appeared,
this prevailed very much upon my thoughts. It
grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said,
dozed my head so much, that I inclined to sleep ;
so I left my lamp burning in my cave, lest I
should want any thing in the night, and went to
bed; but before I lay down, I did whatI had
never done in my life, I kneeled down and pray-
ed to God to fulfil the promise to me, that if I
called upon him he would deliver me. After
my broken and imperfect prayer was over, I
drank the rum in which I had steeped the to-

] o

d
bacco, which was so strong and rank with it,
thatI could scarcely get it down, immediately
upon this I went to bed, and I presently found
it flew up into my head violently; but I fell
into a sound sleep, and waked no more, till by
the sun it appeared to be three o'clock in the
afternoon of the next day; nay, to this hourI

am partly of opinion, that I slept all the next
day and night, and till three that day after; for

otherwise I knew not how I should lose a day
out of my reckoning in the days of the week,
as it appeared some years after I had done: for
if I had lost it by crossing and recrossing the
lineII should have lost more than one day. But,
in my account, it was lost, andl never knew
which way. _

When I awaked, I found myself exceedingly
refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful;
when I got up I was stronger than Iwas the
day before, and my stomach better, for I was
hungry; and in short, I had no fit the next-
day, but continued much altered for the better.
This was the 29th.

The 30th was my well day of course, andl
went abroad with my gun, but did not care to
travel too far. I killed a searfowl or two, some-
thinglike a brand-gOOSe, and brought them home,
but was not in humour to eat them; so I eat

some more of the turtle's eggs, which were very
good. This evening I renewed the medicine
which I had supposed did me good the day be-
fore, viz. the tobacco steeped in rum, only I did
not take so much as before, nor did] chew any
of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke;
however, I was not so well the next day, which

was the first of July, as I hoped I should have
been; for I had a little of the cold fit, but it

was not much. ,

July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three
ways, and dosed myself with it as at first; and

doubled the quantity which I drank.
July 3. I missed the fit for good and all,
though I did not recover my full strength for

some weeks after. While I was thus gathering
strength, my thoughts run exCeedingly upon this
scripture, ('4 I will deliver thee ;" and the impos-
sibility of my deliverance lay much upon my
mind in bar of my ever expecting it. But as I
was discouraging myself with such thoughts, it
occurred to my mind, that I pored so much upon
my deliverance from the main amiction, that I
disregarded the deliverance I had received; and
~.I 3
I was, as it were, made to ask myself such ques-
tions as these, \iz. " Have Inot been delivered,
-and wonderfully too, from sickness; from the
most distressed condition that could be, and that
was so frightfulto me? And what notice had I
taken of it? Had I done my part, God had de--
livered me; but I had not glorified him, that is
to say, I had not owned and been thankful for
that as deliverance, and how could I expect
greater deliverance !" This touched my heart
very much, and immediately I kneeled down,
and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery from
sickness.

J uly 4. In the morning I took the bible, and
beginning at the New Testament, I began seri<
ously to read it, and imposed upon myself to read
awhile every morning and night, not tying myself
to the number of chapters, but as long as my
thoughts would engage me. It was not long after
I set seriously to this work, but I found my heart
more deeply and sincerely affected with the wick-

edness of my past life; the impression of my
dream revived, and the words, " All these things
have not brought thee to repentance," ran seri-
ously in my thoughts. I was earnestly begging
of God to give me repentance, when it happened
providentially that very day on reading the
scripture, I came to these words--" He is exalted
a prince and a saviour, to give repentance, and
to give remission !" I threw down the book, and
with my heart, as well as my hands lifted up to
heaven, in a kind of extasy of joy, I cried out
aloud, " Jesus, thou Son of David--Jesus, thou

exalted Prince and Saviour, give me repen-
tauce!"

This was the first time that I could say in the
true sense of the words, thatI prayed in all my
life; for now I prayed with a sense of my condi-
tion, and with a true scripture View of hope,
founded on the encouragement of the word of
God, and from this time, I may say, I began to
have hopes that God would hear me.

Now I began to construe the words before
mentioned, " Call on me, and I will deliver you,"
in a different sense from what I had ever done be-
fore; as then I had no notion of any thing being
called a deliverance, but my being delivered
from the captivity I was in, for though I was in-
deed at large in the place, yet the island was
certainly a prison to me, and that in the worst
sense in the world; but now I learned to take it
in another sense. Now I looked back upon my
past life with horror, and my sins appearedso
dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God,
but deliverance from the load of guilt that bore
down all my comfort. As for my solitary life, it

was nothing; I did not so much as pray to be
delivered from it, or think of it; it was all of no
consideration in comparison to this: but again I
proceed with my journal.

My icondition began now to be, though not
less miserable as to my way of living, yet much
easxer to my mind: and my thoughts being di-
rected, by a constant reading the scripture, and
praying to God, to things of a higher nature; I
had a great deal of comfort within, which till now
I knew nothing of; my health and strength also
returned, I bestirred myself to furnish me with
every thing that I wanted, and make my way of
living as regular as I could.

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly
employed in walking about with my gun in my
hand, a little and little at a time, as a man that
was gathering up his strength after a fit of sick-
ness: for it is hardly to be imagined how low I
was, and to what weakness I was reduced. The
before, neither can I recommend it to any one to
practise by this experiment; and though it did
carry 03 the fit, yet it rather contributed to
weaken me; for I had frequent convulsions in my
nerves and limbs for some time.

I learnt from it also this in particular, that
being abroad in the rainy season was the most
pernicious thing to my health that could be, es- '
pecially in those rains which come attended by
storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain
which came in a dry season was always most ac-
companied with such storms, so I found that rain
was much more dangerous than the rain which
fell in September and October.

I had now been above ten monthsin the island;
and as I had never seen any of the human kind,
I therefore accounted myself as sole monarch;
and as I grew better, having secured my habita--
tion to my mind, Iresolved to make a tour round
my kingdom, in order to make new discoveries.

The 15th of July I began my Journey. I first
went to the creek, where I had brought my rafts
on shore; and travelling farther, found the tide
went no higher than two miles up, where there
was a little brook of running water, on the
banks of which were many pleasant savannas,94 anvau'rnnns or

or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with
grass. '

On the rising parts, where I supposed the
water did not reach, I perceived a great deal of
tobacco growing to a very strong stalk; several
other plants I likewise found, the virtues of which
I did not understand.

So that while I pursued this journey of disco-
very, as Imay call it, I found many occasions to
regret the want of that useful knowledge I had in
my youth neglected to obtain.

I sought in vain for the Cassava-root, of which
I knew the Indians in that island made their
bread ; but all in vain. There wereseveral plants
of aloes, though at that time I knew not what
they were; likewise I saw several sugar-canes,
but imperfect for want of cultivation. With
these few discoveries, Icame back that night,
and slept contentedly in my little castle. The
next day, being the 16th, going the same way,
but farther than the day before, I found the
country more adorned with woods and trees.
Here I perceived different fruits in great abun-
dance. Melons in plenty lay on the ground, and
clusters of grapes, ripe and very rich, spread
over the trees.
You may imagine I was glad of this discovery,
yet eat very sparingly, lest I should throw myself

into a flux or fever. The grapes I found of ex-
cellent use; for when I had dried them in the
sun, which preserved them as dried raisins are
kept, they proved very wholesome and nourish-
ing, and served me in those seasons when no
grapes were to be had.

The night drawing on apace, I ascended up a
tree and slept very comfortably, though it was
the first time I had lain out of my habitation: and
when. the morning came, I proceeded, with great
'pleasure, on my way, travelling about four miles,
as Iimagined, by the length of the valley, direct-
ing my course northward, there being a ridge of
hills on the south and north side of me. At the
end of this valley Icame to an opening, where
the country seemed to descend to the west;
there I found a little spring of fresh water, pro-
ceeding out of the side of a hill, with its crystal
streams running directly east.

And indeed here my senses were charmed with
the most beautiful landscape nature could afford ;
for the country appeared so flourishing, green,

and delightful, that to me it seemed like a planted-
garden. Ithen descended on the side of that
delicious rule, when I fouml abundance ot'coeoa,
orange, lemon, and citron-trees, but very wild
and barren at that time. As for the limes, they
were delightful and wholesome; the juice of
which I afterwards used to mix with water, which
made it Very cool and refreshing.

And now I wasresolred to carry home and lay
up a store of grapes, limes, and lemons, against.
the approaching wet season. So la;- ing them up
in separate parcels, and then taking-a few of
each uith me, I returned to my little castle, after
hating spent three days in thisjourney. Before
I got home the grapes were so bruised that they
"ere utterly spoiled. The limes indeed were
gtmd ; hut ofthese I could bring only a few.

July 12'). Having prepared two bags I returned
thither again; but, to my great surprise, found
all the grapes spread about, trod to pieces, ml
abundance eaten, which made me conclude there
werewihl beasts thereabout. To prevent this
happening again, I gathered a large quantity of
the grapes, and hung them upon the upper
branches ol'the trees, both to he in them unhurt,
and that they might cure and dry in the sun; and
having well loaded myself with limes and lemons,
I returned once more to my old place of resi-
dence.

And now, contemplating on the fruitfulness of
this valley, the pleasantness of its situation, its
security from storms, and the beauty of the ad-
jacent woods, I concluded I was settled in the
worst part of the country, and therefore was
thinking to remove my habitation. But when I
considered again, that though it was pleasant, it
was off from the sea-side, where there was a pos-
sibility, some time or other, a ship might either
be driven or sail by; and that to enclose myself
among hills and woods must certainly put an end
to my hopes of deliverance, I resolved to let my
castle remain where Providence had first assigned
it. Yet so delighted was I with this place, that
I made a little kind of bower, surrounding it
with a double hedge, as high as I could reach,

well staked, and filled with bulrushes; and

having spent a great part of the month of July,

I think it was the first of August before I began

to enjoy my labour. '
Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry I

took them from the trees, and they proved ex.

cellent good raisins of the sun; the most of which

K
- I carried to my cave; and happy for meI did so,
by which I saved the best part of my winter food.

Aug. 14. This day it began to rain; and
though I had made me a tent like the other, yet
having-no shelter of a hill to keep me from storms,
and a cave behind to retreat to, I was obliged to
return to my old castle.

The rain continued more or less every day till
the middle of October; and sometimes so vio-
lently, that 1 could not stir out of my cave for
several days. This season I found my family to
encrease; for one of my cats that ran away from
me, and which I thought had been dead, returned
about August with three kittens at her heels like
herself. The wild cats of the island seemed to
be of a different kind from our European cats;
but from these cats proceeded such numbers, that
I was forced to destroy them as .I would do wild
beasts or vermin.

To the 20th of this month I could not stir
out, it raining incessantly; when beginning to
want food, I was compelled to venture twice, the
first of which I shot a goat, and afterwards found
a very large tortoise. The manner of regulating
my food was thus: A bunch of raisins served

me for breakfast, a piece of goat's flesh orturtle
broiled for my dinner, and two or three turtle's
eggs for my supper.

While the rain lasted I daily worked two or
three hours at enlarging my cave: and by degrees
worked it on towards one side, till I came to the.
outside of the hill, and made a door or way out,
which came beyond my fence, or wall; and so I
came in and out this way. But after I had done
this, I was troubled to see myself thus exposed;
though I could not perceive any thing to fear, a
goat being the biggest creature I had seen upon

this island.

Sept. 30. Casting up the notches on mylpost,
which amounted to three hundred and sixty-five,
I concluded this to be the anniversary of my
landing; and therefbre humbly prostrating my-
self on the ground, confessing my sins, acknow-
ledging God's righteous judgments upon me, and
praying to Jesus Christ to have mercy upon me.
I fasted for twelve hours till the going down of
the sun; and then, eating a biscuit and a bunch
of grapes, laid me on the bed, and with great

comfort took my night's repose.
Till this time I never had distinguished the

sabbath day; but now I made a longer notch
than ordinary for the days of rest, and divided
K 2
the weeks as well as I could, though I found I
had lost a day or two in my account. My ink
failing soon after, I omitted in my daily memo-
randum things of an indifferent nature, and con-
tented myself to write down only the most re-
markable events of my life.

The rainy and dry seasons appeared now regu-
lar to me, and experience taught me how to
provide for them: yet, in one thing I am going
to relate, my experience very much failed me.
You may call to mind what I have mentioned of

some barley and rice which I had saved; about
thirty stalks of the former, and twenty of the
latter; and at that time the sun being in its
southern position, going from me together with
the rains, made me conclude it a very proper
season to sow it. Accordingly I dug up a piece
.of ground with my wooden spade, and dividing
it in two parts, sowed about two thirds of my
seed, preserving by me about a handful of each.
And happily it was I did so; for, no rain falling,
it was parched up, and never appeared above the
earth till the wet season came again, and then

part of it grew as if it had been newly sown.
I was resolved still to make another trial; and

seeking for a moister piece of. ground near my
boWer, I there sowed the rest of my seed in Feb- '
ruary, a little before the vernal equinox, which,
having the rainy months of March and April to
water it, yielded a noble crop, and sprung up '
very pleasantly.

I had still saved part of the seed, not daring
to venture all; and by the time I found out the
proper season to sow in, and that I might expect
every year two seed times and two harvests, my
stock amounted to above half a peck of each sort
of grain. ,

No sooner were the rains over, but the stakes
which I had cut from the trees shot out-like wil-
lows. I was ignorant of the tree I had cut them

from; but they grew so regularly beautiful, that
they made a most lively appearance; and so
flourished in three years time, thatl resolved to

cut more of them; and these soon growing, made
a glorious fence, as afterwards I shall observe.

And now I perceived that the seasons of the
year might generally be divided, not into summer
and winter, as in Europe, but into wet and dry
seasons, as in this manner:--

The wet seasons would continue longer or
shorter as the winds happened to blow: but
having found the ill consequences of being abroad
in the rain, I took care beforehand to furnish
myself with provisions: and, during the wet
months, sat within doors as much as possible.

At this time I contrived to make many things
that I wanted, though it cost me much labour
and pains before I accomplished them. The
first I tried was to make a basket; but all the '
twigs I could get proved so brittle, thatI could
not then perform it. It now proved of great ad-

-va_ntage to me that, when a boy, I took great-nomso'n swabs. 10$ .

delight in' standing at a basket maker's, in the
same town where my father lived, to view them
at work: and, like other boys, curious to' see
the manner of their working these things, and
very oflicious to assist, I perfectly learned the
method of it, and wanted nothing but the tools:
and it coming into my head, that thetwigs of that
tree of which I made my stakes might be as tough
as sallow, willow, or oziers, growing in England,
I resolved to make an eXperiment, and went the
next day to my country seat, and found some fit
for my turn; and after cutting down a quantity
with my hatchet, I dried them in my pale, and
when fit to work with carried them to my cave,

where I employed myself in making several sorts
of baskets, insomuch that I succeeded in what-

ever I pleased. It is true, that they were mot
cleverly made: yet they served my turn upon all
occasions.

But still I wanted two necessary things. I had
no cask to hold my liquor, neither had I a pot
to boil any thing in. I wanted, likewise, at the
beginning of this dry season, a tobacco-pipe; but
for this I afierwards found an eXpedient. '

I kept myselfemployed in planting my seeond
row of stakes; but remembering that when I _
travelled up to the brooli I had a wish to see the.
whole island, I now resumed my intention; and
taking my dog, gun, hatchet, some biscuit, a
great bunch of raisins, with a larger quantity of
powder and shot than usual, I began my journey.

Having past the vale where my bower stood,
I came within view of the sea lying to the west;
when it being a clear day, I fairly descried land,
extending from the W. to the S.W. about 10 or ] 5
leagues, as I concluded; but could not say whe-
ther it was an island or a continent: I thought it
might be part of America, or the Spanish coast:
and if it were not, then it must be the savage
coast, between the Spanish country and Brasil,
which abounds with cannibals, or man-eaters.

As I proceeded forward, I found this side of
the island much more pleasant than mine; the
fragrant fields adorned with sweet flowers and
verdant grass, together with several fine woods.
There were parrots in plenty, which made me
long for one to be my companion; but it was with
great difficulty I could knock one down with my
stick, and I kept him at home some years before
I could get him to call me by my name.

In this journey I did not travel above two miles
a day, because I took several turns and winding:
to see what discoveries I could make, returning
weary enough to the place where I designed to
rest all night, which was either in a tree, or to a
place which I surrounded with stakes, that no
wild creature might suddenly surprise me.

When I came to the sea-shore I was amazed to
see the splendor of it: its strand was covered
with shells of the most beautiful kinds, and con-
stantly abounding with innumerable turtles, and
fowls of many species, which I was ignorant of,

except those called penguins. \ .

I continued my journey, travelling about twelve _
miles farther towards the east, where I fixed a
great pile on the shore -for a mark, concluding
that my next journey would bring me to the other
side of the island, east from my castle, and so
round till I came to my post again. As I had a
constant view of the country, I thought I could
not miss my way; but scarce had I travelled three
miles, when I deScended into a very large valley,
so surrounded with hills covered with wood, that
having no certain guide but the sun, nor even that
now, it being entirely bid by the hills, I was
obliged to return to my post by the sea-side; and
so backwards in the same way I came. , In this
journey my dog surprised a kid, and would have>>
killed it, had I not prevented him.

As I had often been thinking of getting a kid
or two, and so raising a breed of tame goats to

supply me after my ammunition was spent, I took
this opportunity of beginning: and having made
a collar for this little creature with a string of
rope yarn, I brought it to my bower, and there
enclosed and left it; and, having spent a month
in this journey, at length I returned to my old
habitation.

Nobody can doubt of my satisfaction when I
arrived at my little castle, and reposed myself in
my hammock. After my journey I rested myself
a week, which time I employed in making a cage
for my pretty Poll. I now began to think of the
poor kid I had left at the bower; and I immedi-
ately went to fetch it home. When I came there
I found the young creature almost starved. I
gave it some food, and tied it as before; but
there was no occasion, for it followed me like a
dog; and, as -I constantly fed it, it became so
loving, gentle, and fond, that it commenced one
of my domestics, and would never leave me.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox
being now come, I kept the 30th of September
in the most solemn manner, as usual; it being the'
third year of my abode in thejsland. I spent
the Whole day in acknowledging God's mercies;
in giving him thanks for making this solitary life
as agreeable, and less sinful than that of human
society; and for the communications of his grace
to my soul, in supporting, comforting, and en.
couraging me to depend upon his Providence,

and hope for his eternal presence in the world to '
come.

I would often wring my hands, and weep like _
a child, when I considered the desolate situation-
I was in--shut out from all mankind. Sometimes
in the middle of my work this fit would take me,
and then I would sit down and sigh, looking at
the ground for an hour or twoto'gether, till such
time as my grief got vent in a flood of tears.-

One morning as I was sadly employed in this
manner, Iopened my bible, when immediately I-
fixed,my eyes upon these words, I will never
leave thee, nor forsake thee. Surely, thought I,
these ,words are directed to me, orelse, why
should they appear just atla moment when-I was
bemoaning my forlorucondition? 'And if God '
does not forsake me, what matters it, since he
can make me more happy in this state of life
than if I enjoyed the greatest splendor in the
world? '

And now beginning my third year, my several
daily employments were these: First, my duty to
Heaven, and diligent reading the holy scrip-
tures, which I did twice or thrice every day.
Secondly, seeking provision with my gun, which
commonly took me up, when it did not rain,
' three hours every morning. Thirdly, the order-
ing, curing, preserving, and cooking what Ihad
killed, or caught for my supply, which took me

up a great part of the day: for in the middle of
the day, the sun being in its height, it was so

hot, that I could not stir out; so that I had only
four hours in the evening to work in; and then
the want of tools, of assistance, and skill,
wasted a great deal of time to little purpose.

I was not less than two-and-forty days making
a board fit for a long shelf, which two sawyers,
with their tools and saw-pit, would have cut out
of the same tree in half a day. It was of a large
tree, as my board was to be broad. I was three
days in cutting it down, and two more in lopping
off the boughs, and reducing it to a piece of

timber. This I hacked and hewed off each side
. till it became light to move; then I turned it,
made one side of it smooth, and flat as a board
from end to end; then turned it downward,
cutting the other side, till I brought the plank to
be about three inches thick, and smooth on both

sides. Any body may judge of my great labour
and fatigue in such a piece of work; but this I
went through with patience, as also many other
things that my circumstances made necessary for
me to do.

The harvest months, November and December,
were now at hand, in which I had the pleasing

prospect of a very good crop. But here I met
with a new misfortune: for the goats and hares,

having tasted of the sweetness of the blade,
kept it so short, that it had not strength to shoot
up into a stalk. To prevent this 1 enclosed it
with a hedge, and by day shot some of its dee ;
vourers; and my dog, which I had tied to the
field--gate, barking all night, so frightened these
creatures, that I got entirely rid of them.

But no sooner did I get rid of these, than other
enemies appeared, to wit, whole flocks of several
sorts of birds, which only waited till my back
was turned to ruin me. . So much did this pro-
voke me, that I let fly and killed three of the.

L
malefactors; and afterwards served them as they
do notorious thieves in England, hung them up
in chains as a terror to others. And indeed so

good an effect had this, that they not only forsook

the corn, but all that part of the island, so long
as these criminals hung there.

My corn having ripened apace, the latter end
of December, which was my second harvest, I

reaped it with a scythe, made of one of my
broad swords. I had no fatigue in cutting down

my first crop, it was so slender. The cars I
carried home in a basket, rubbing it out with
my hands, instead of threshing it; and when my
harvest was over, found my half peek of seed
produced near two bushels of rice, and two
bushels and a half of barley.

And now, having more seed, my first care was
to prepare me more land. I pitched upon two
large flat pieces of ground, near my castle, for
that purpose, which I 'dug up with my wooden
spade, in which I sawed my seed, and fenced
it with a good hedge.

Thisptooh me three months, by which time, the
wet season coming on, and the rain keeping me
within doors, I found several occasions to employ
myself; and while at work used to divert myself
with talking to my parrot, learning him to know
and speak his own name, Poll, the first welcome
word I heard spoke in the island. I had been
a long time contriving how to make earthen ves-

sels, which I wanted extremely; and when I
considered the heat of the climate, I did not
doubt but if I could find any such clay, I
might botch up a pot strong enough, when dried
in the sun, to bear handling, and to hold any thing
that was dry, as corn, meal, and other things.
In short,- the clay I found; but it would oc-
casion the most serious person to smile, to see
what awkward ways I took, and- what, ugly '
mishapen things I made; how many either fell
out or cracked by the violent heat of the sun,

and fell in pieces when they were removed. 1, So
I think it was two months' time before I could

perfect any thing, and even then but two clumsy
things in imitation of earthen jars.

These, however, I very gently placed in/wicker
baskets, made on purpose for them; and, be.
tween the pot and basket, stuffed it full of rice
and barley-straw: and these, I presumed, would

hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal when
the corn was bruised. As for the smaller things,

Imade them with better success; such as little
L 2
round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins,
the sun baking them very hard.

Yet still I wanted one thing absolutely neces-
sary, and that was an earthen pot, not only to
hold my liquid, but also to bear the fire, which
none ol'thcse could do. It happened once that
as I was putting out my lire, I found therein a
broken piece of one of my vessels, burnt hard
as a rock, and red as a tile. This made me
think of burning some pots; and having no no-
tion of a kiln, or of glazing them with lead, I
fixed three large pipkins, and two or three pots,
in a pile one upon another. The fire I piled
round the outside, and dry wood on the top, till

I saw the pots in the inside red--hot, and found
that they did not crack at all; and when I per-
ceived them perfectly red, I let one of them
stand in the fire five or six hours, till the clay
melted by the extremity of the heat, and would
have run to glass, had I suffered it; upon which
I slackened my fire by degrees till the redness
abated; and watching them till the morning, I
found I had three very good pipkins and two
earthen pots, as well burnt and fit for my pur-
pose as I could desire.

Nojoy could be greater than mine at this dis-
eovery; for after this, Imay say, I wantedfor
no sort of earthenware. I filled one of my pip-
kins with water to boil me some meat, which it
did admirably well; and with a piece of kid I
'made me some good broth, as well as my cir-
cumstances would afford me at that time.

The next concern I had was to get me a stone

mOrtar to beat some corn in, instead of a mill to
grind it. Here indeed I was at a great loss:
many days I spent to find a great stone big enough
to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar, and strong
enough to bear the weight of a pestle, that would
break the corn without filling it with sand: but
all the stones of the island being of a mouldering
nature, rendered my search fruitless: and then
Iresolved to look out for a great block of hard
wood; which having soon found, ,1 formed it
with my axe and hammer, and then with infinite
labour made a hollow in it, just as the Indians
of Brasil make their canoes. When I had finished
this, I made a great pestle of iron-wood, and
then laid them up till my succeeding harvest.

My next business was to make me a sieve to
sift my meal, and part it from the bran and husk.
Having no fine thin canvas to sift the meal
through, I could not tell what to do. The

L 3
linen I had was reduced to rags; I had goats'
hair enough, but neither tools to work it, nor
did I know how to spin it: at length I remem-
bered I had some neckcloths of calico 0r muslin
of the sailors, which I had brought out of the
ship, and with these I made three small sieves,
proper enough for the work.

I came now to consider the baking part. The
want of an oven I supplied by making some
earthen pans very broad, but not deep. When
I had a mind to bake I made a great fire upon
my hearth, the tiles of which Imade myself;
and when the wood was burnt into live coals,
Ispread them over it, till it became very hot;
then sweeping them away, I set down my loaves,
'and turning down the earthen pots upon them,
drew the ashes and coals all round the outside of
thepots to continue the heat; and in this manner
I baked my barley loaves, as well as if I had
been a complete pastry-cook; and also made of
the rice several cakes and puddings.

It was no wonder that these employments took
me up the best part of a year, since what inter-
mediate time} had was bestowed in managing
my new harvest and husbandry 3 for in the proper

season I reaped my corn, carried it home, and
laid it up in the ear in my large baskets, till I
had time to rub, instead of threshing it. And
now indeed my corn encreased so much, that it
produced me about twenty bushels of barley,
and as much of rice; that I not only began to

use it freely, but was thinking how to enlarge my
barns, and resolved to sow as much at a time as

would be sufficient for me for a whole year.

All this while, the prospect of land, which I
had seen from the other side of the island, ran
in my mind. I still meditated a deliverance from
this place, though the fear of greater misfor-
tunes might have deterred me from it 3 for, al-

lowing that I had attained that place, I run the
hazard of being killed and eaten by the devour-

ing cannibals; and if they were not so, yet I
might be slain, as other Europeans had been who
fell into their hands. Notwithstanding all this,

my thoughts ran continually upon that shore.

I now wished for my boy Xury, and the long-
boat, with the shoulder of mutton sail. ~ I went to
the ship's boat, that had been cast a great way on
the shore in'the late storm : she was removed buta
little, but her bottom being turned up by the imv
petuosity and fury of the waves and wind, I fell to

work with all the strengthl had, and with levers" s

116 - ADVENTURES or ._

and rollers Ihad cut from the wood, to turn her,
and repair the. damages she had sustained. This
work took me up three or four weeks, when find--
ing my little strength all in vain, I fell to under-
mining it by digging away the sand, and so make
it fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and
guide it in the fall. But after this was done, I
was still unable to stir it up, or to get under it, -
much less to move it lbrwards to the water, and
so I was forced to give it over.

This disappointment however did not ti'ighten
me. I began to think whether it was not possible
for me to make a canoe, or perigua, such as the
Indians make of the trunk of a tree. But here
I lay under particular inconveniences; namely,
want of tools to make it, and want of hamls to
move it in the water when it was made. However,
to work I went upon it, stopping all the enquiries
I could make, with this Very simple answer] made
to myself: Let me first. make it, and then find
some way or other to get it along when it is done.

branches. Twenty days I was hacking and
hewing this tree. at the bottom, fourteen more.
in cutting oil the branches and limbs,'anda
whole month in shaping it like. the bottom of a
boat. As for the inside, 1 was three weeks
with a mallet. and chisel, clearing it breach a
manner, that it was big enough to carry twenty-
six men, nmch bigger than an)' canoe 1 had ever
seen in my life, and consequently sufficient to
transport me and all my ctl'ects to that wished-for
shore I so ardeutly desired to get at.

Nothing remained now, but indeed the greatest
ditliculty, namely, to get it into the water, it
lying about one hundred yards from it. To re.-
mt'tl)' the first inconvenience, which was a rising
hill between this boat and the creek, with won-
derful pains and labour I dog into the surface of
the earth, and made a dcclivity.

But when this was done, all the strength I
had was insutiicieut to more it, as it was when I
attempted to more the ship's boat. I then pro-
ceeded to measure the distance of ground, re-_
solved to make a canal, in order to bring the
water to the canoe, since I could not bring the
canoe to the. water.

But. as this was impracticable by myself alone,
118 anvnnrun'n's or

unless with eleven or twelve years' labour, it
brought 'me into some sort of consideration, so
that I concluded this also to be impossible,
and the attempt altogether vain.

I now saw, and not before, what stupidity it
is to begin work before we reckon its costs, or

judge rightly our own abilities to go through with
its performance.

In the heighth of this work, my fourth year
expired from the day I was cast upon this island.
At this time I did not forget my anniversary, but
kept it with rather greater devotion than before;
for now my hopes being frustrated, I looked upon

this world as a thing I had nothing to do with;

and very well might I say, as father Abraham
said unto Dives, " Between me and thee there is
.a gulph fixed."

I had nothing to covet, I had plenty of corn,
turtles, grapes, and timber in abundance. What
was all the rest to me? The money] had by me
lay as despicable dross, which I would have freely
given for a gross oftobaccoypipes, or a hand-mill
to grind my corn; in a word, the nature and
experience of these things dictated to me this
just reflection, that the good things of this world
are no farther of good to us than they are forROBINSON 0311501.. 119

our use; and that whatever we may heap up to
give others, we can but enjoy as much as we use,
and no more.

These thoughts rendered my mind more easy
than usual. Every time I sat down to meat, I I
did it with thankfulness, admiring the providen-
tial hand of God, who, in this wilderness, had
spread a table for me. And now I considered
what I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted; and
compared my present condition with what I at
first expected it would be.

I next compared my station to that which I
deserved: how undutiful I had been to my pa-
rents; how destitute of the fear of God; and
how void of every thing that was good; and how
ungrateful for those abundant mercies I had re>>
ceived from Heaven, being fed, as it were, by a
miracle, even as great as Elijah's being fed with
ravens; and cast upon aplace where there were
no venemous creatures to poison or devour me:'-~
in short, making God's tender mercies matter of
great consolation, I relinquished all sadness, and

gave way to contentment.
As long as my ink continued, which by the

help of water I made to last as long as I c,ould I'.

J
used to minute down the days of the month on
which any remarkable thing happened. And,

First, I observed, that the same day I forsook
my parents and friends, and ran away to Hull,
in order to go to sea, the same day in the next
year I was taken, and made a slave by the Sallee
rovers: -

That the very day I escaped out of the wreck
of the ship in Yarmouth Roads, a year after, on
the same day, I made my escape from Sallee in
my patron's fishing-boat:

And that on the 30th of September, being the
day of the year I was born on, on that day
twenty-six years after was I miraculously saved
and cast on shore on this island.

The next thing that wasted after my ink, was
the biscuit which I had brought out of the ship;
and although I allowed myself but one cake a day
for above a twelvemonth, yet I was quite out of
bread for near a year before I could .get any

corn of my own.

In the next place, my clothes began to decay,
and my linen had been gone long before. ' How-
ever, I had preserved about three dozen of the
sailors' chequered shirts, which proved a great
refreshment to me, when the violent'beams of the
sun would not suffer me to bear any of the seas
men's heavy watch-scents, which made me turn
taylor, and, after a miserable batching manner,
convert them to jackets. To preserve my head,
I made me a cap of goat-skins, with the hair
outwards to keep out the rain, which indeed
served me so well that afterwards I made me
a waistcoat and open-kneed breeches of the
same: and then I contrived a sort of umbrella,
.~ covering it with skins, which not only kept out
the heat of the sun, but the rain also. Thus
being easy and settled in my mind, my. chiefest
happiness was to converse with God in' most '
heavenly and comfortable ejaculations.

For five years after this I cannot say any extra0
ordinary thing occurred to me. My chief em-
ployment was to cure my raisins and plant my
barley and rice, of both which I had a year's
provision beforehand.

But though I was disappointed in my first
canoe, I made it at intermediate times my busi-

ness to make a second, of much inferiorsize;
and it was. two years before I finished it. But.
. as I perceived it would no ways answer my design

of sailing to the other shore, my thoughts were
M
confined to taking a tour round the island, to
see what further discoveries I could make. To
this intent, after having moved her to the water,
and tried how she would sail, I fitted up a little
mast to my boat, and made a sail of the ship's
sail that lay by me.

[then made lockers, or boxes, at the. end of
it, to put in necessaries, provisions, and ammu-
nition, which would preserve them dry either
from rain or the. spray of the sea; and in the
inside of the boat I cut me a long hollow place
to lay my gunkand to keep it dry made a flap
to hang over it. My umbrella I fixed in a step
in the stern, like a mast, to keep the heat of the
sun from me. .

And now resolving to see the circumference of
my little kingdom, I victualled my ship for the
voyage, putting in two dozen of my barley-bread
loaves, an earthen pot full of parched rice, a little
bottle of rum, half a goat, powder and shot,
and two watch-coats. It was the sixth of No-
vember, in the sixth year of my reign, or cap-
tivity, that I set out on this voyage, which was
much longer than I expected, being obliged to
put farther out by reason of ' the rocks that lay
a great way in the sea. And indeed so much did
these rocks surprise me, that I was for putting
back, f'aring that if I ventured farther, it would
be. out of my power to return. In this uncer-
tainty I came to an anchor just off shore, to
which I waded with my gun on my shoulder, and
then climbing up a hill which overlooked that
point, [saw the full extent of it, and so I re--
solved to run all hazau s.

In this prospect from the hill I perceived a
violent current running to the east, coming very
close to the point; which I the more carefully
observed, thinking it dangerous, and that when

I came to it I might be driven into the sea by its
force, and not be able to return to the island;

and certainly it must have been so had I not made
this observation; for on the other side was the
like current, with this ditference, that it set of?
at a greater distance; and I perceived there was
a strong eddy under the land, so that my chief
business was to work out of the first current, and
conveniently to get into the eddy.

Two days I stayed here, the wind blowing very
briskly E. S. E. which, being contrary to the
current, lea 'es a great breach of the sea upon
the point; so it was neither fit for me to keep too
near the shore, on account of the breach, nor

M 2
stand at too great a distance, for fear of the
streams.

That night, the wind abating, it grew so calm
that [ventured out, and here I may be a monu-
ment to all rash and ignorant pilots; for I was
no sooner come. to the point, and not above the
boat's length from shore, but I was got into a
deep water, with a current like a mill, which
drove my boat along so .violently, that it was
impossible for me to keep her near the edge of
it, but forced me more and more out from the
eddy to the left of me; and all I could do with
my paddles was useless, there being no wind to
help me.

Now I began to look upon myself as quite
lost; since as the current ran on both sides of
the island, 1 was very certain it must join again,
and then I had no hopes but of perishing for
want in the sea, after what provisions I had were
spent, or before, if a storm should happen to
arise.

Who can conceive the anguish of my mind at
this Lcalamity? With longing eyes did I look
upon my little kingdom, and thought that island
the pleasantest place in the universe. Happy,
thrice happy desert, said I, shall I never see'4 r

thee more? Wretched creature l--Whither am
I going? - Why did I murmur at my lonesome
condition, when now I- would give- the whole
world to be thither again?

While I was thus complaining, I found myself
to be driven about two leagues into the sea.
However, I laboured till my strength was far
spent, to keep my boat as far north as possibly
1 could, to that side of the current where the
eddy lay. About noon I perceived a little breeze.
of wind spring up from the S. S. E. which over-
'joyed my heart; and I was still more elated,
when, in about half an hour, it blew a gentle
line gale.

Had it been thick weather I had been lost
another way; for having no compass on board, I
should never have found the way to steer towards
the island, if once it had disappeared; but it
proving the contrary, I set up my mast again,
spread my sail, and stood away northward as
much as I could, to get rid of the current. No
sooner did the boat begin to steer away, but I
perceived, by the clearness of the water, a
change of the current was near; for where it was
strong the water was foul, and where it was
clear the current abated. To the cast I soon

M3
saw, about half a mile distant, a breach of the
sea upon some rocks, which caused it again to
separate; and as the main force. drove away
more southwardly, hating the rocks to the

north-east, so the other came back by the re-

pulse of the rocks, making a sharp eddy, which
returned back again to the north-west with a
very swift stream.

They who have experienced what it is to be

saved from theives just going to take away their
lives, or such as have been in like calamities

with my own, mayo ouess my present excess of
joy, how heartily I ran my boat into the stream
of this eddy, and how joyfully I spread my sail
to the refreshing wind, standing cheerfully be-
fore it with a smart tide under foot.

By the assistance of this eddy I was carried
above a league home again, when, being in the
wake of the island, betwixt two currents, I found
the water to be at a sort of a stand. About four
o'clock in the afternoonl reached within a league
of the island, and perceived the points of the
rock, which caused this disaster, stretching out,
as I observed before, to the southward, which,
throwing 06' the current more southwardly, had
occasioned another eddy to the north. But
having a fair brisk gale, I stretched across this
eddy, and in an hour came within a mile of the
shore, where I soon landed to my unspeakable
comfort; and after an humble prostration, thank-
ing God for my deliverance, with a resolution to

lay all thoughts of escaping aside, I brought my.
boat safe to a little cove, and laid me down to
take a welcome repose.

When I awoke I was considering how I might
get .my boat home; and coasting along the shore,
I came to a good bay, which ran up to a rivulet,
or brook, where, finding a safe harbour, I stowed
her as safe as if she had been in a dry dock made

on purpose for her.

I now perceived myself not far from the place
where before I had travelled on foot: so, taking
nothing with me except my gun and umbrella, I
began my journey, and in the evening came to
my bower, where I again laid me down to rest.
I had not slept long before I was awakened in
great surprise by a strange voice that called me
several times, << Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe! -'
Poor Robin! Where are you Robin Crusoe--
where are you? Where have you been '1" 80
fast was I_asleep at first, that I did not awake
thoroughly: but half asleep and half awake, I
thoughtl dr'amed that somebody spoke. to me.
But as the voice repeated " Robinson Crusoe"
several times, I started up in the utmost. confir-
sion; and no sooner were my eyes fully open,
but. I beheld my pretty l'oll sitting on the top
ofthe hedge, and soon knew that. it was he that
called me; for just in such bewailing language
I used to talk and teach him, which he so ex-
actly learned, that he would sit upon my finger
and lay his bill close to my face, and cry,
" Poor Robinson Crusoe, where are you? Where
have you been? llow came you here?" And
such like prattlel had constantly taughthim.
Jut et en though I knew it to be the parrot, it
was a great. while before I could adjust myself;
being amazed how the creature got thither, and
that he should fix about the place and nowhere
clse. But. now, being assured it could be no
other than my honest l'oll, my wonder ceased;
and reaching out. my hand, and calling familiarly
Poll, the poor creature came. to me, and perched
upon my thumb, as he was wont to do, still re-

1'

peating " l'oor Robinson Crusoe, and enquir-
ing how I came. here, and where I had been;
as it'the bird were m eijoyed to see me.

I was now pretty well cured of rambling to
sea; yetI wished to have my boat, which had
cost me so much trouble and pains, on my side

of the. island once more, but this was indeed im--
practicable.

l tl'ieretbre began to lead a very retired life,
living near a twelvemonth in a very contented
manner, wanting for nothing, except. conversa-
tion. As to mechanic-labours, which my ne-
cessities obliged me to apply to, I fanciedl
could upon occasions make a tolerable carpen-
ter, were the tools I had to work withal but
good. Besides, as [improved in my earthen-
ware, I contrived to make them with a wheel,
which I found much easier and better; my work,
which before was rude and ugly, became neat
and shapely. '

But] think I was never so elevated with my
own per formance, or project, as when I was able
to make a tobacco-pipe; which, though it proved
an awkward, clumsy thing, yet was very sound,
and carried the smoke perfectly well, to my great
satisfaction.

I also improved my wicker-ware, making me
abundance of necessary baskets, which, though
not very handsome, were handy and convenient
to bring things home in, and also for holding any
stores, barley, rice, and other provisions.

My powder beginning to fail, made me exa'
mine after what manner I should kill the goats
and birds to live on, after it was all gone.' I
contrived many ways to ensnare the goats, and
see if I could catch them. alive, particularly a
she-goat, with young; and at last I had my de-
sire, for, making pit-falls and traps, baited with
barley and rice, I found one morning. in one of
them an old lie-goat, and in the other three kids,
one male, the other two females.

So boisterous was the old one, that I could
not bring him away. .But I forgot the old pro-
verb, that " hunger will tame a lion." For had
I kept him three or four days without victuals,
and then given him some water, with a little corn,

he would have been as tame as a young kid.
The other creaturesl bound with strings. to-
gether, but I had great difficulty before I could
bring them to my habitation. It was some time
before they would feed, but by throwing them
sweet corn, it so much tempted them that they
began to be tame; from hence I concluded,

that if I designed to furnish myself with goat's
flesh, when my ammunition was spent, the tamely
breeding them up, like a flock of sheep, about
my settlement, was the only method I could
take.

I concluded also that I must separate the wild
from the tame, or else they would always run
wild as they grew up; and the best way for this
was to have some enclosed piece of ground, well
fenced, either with a hedge or paling, to keep
them so effectually, that those within 'might not
break out, or those withoutbreak in.

Such an undertaking was very great for one
pair of hands; but as there was an absolute ne--
cessity for doing it, my first care was to find a
convenient piece of ground, where there was '
likely to be herbage for them to eat, water to
drink, and cover tokeep them from the sun.

Here again I gave another instance of my ig-
' norance and inexperience, pitching upon a piece
of meadow-land so large, that had I enclosed it,
the hedge or paling must have been at least two
miles about. Indeed had it been ten miles, I,
had time enough to do it in: but then I did not

consider my goats would be as wild in so much
campus, as if they hadhad the whole island;
and consequently as difficult for me to catch

them. .

This thought came into my head, after I had
carried it on, I believe, fifty yards; I therefore
altered my scheme, and resolved to enclose a
piece of ground about one hundred and fifty
yards in length, and one hundred in breadth,

- sufficient for as many as would maintain me till
such time as my flock encreased, and then I
could add more ground.

I now vigorously prosecuted my work, and
it took me about three months hedging the first
piece, in which timeI tethered the three kids in
the best part of it, feeding them as near me as
possible, to make them familiar: and indeed I

very often would carry some ears of barley, or
a handful of rice. and feed them out of my

hand; by which means they grew so tame, that
when my enclosure was finished, and I had let
them loose, they would run after me for a hand-

ful of com.
This indeed answered my end; and in a year
and a half 's time, I had a flock of about twelve
a goats, kids and all; and intwo years after they

amounted to forty-three, besides what I had
taken and killed for my sustenance. After
which I enclosed five several pieces of ground to
feed them in, with pens to drive them into, that
I might take them as I had occasion.

in this project I likewise found additional
blessings; for I had not only plenty of goat's
flesh, but milk too, which, in my beginning, I
did not so much as think of: and indeed,
though I had never milked a cow, much less a"
goat, or seen butter or cheese made, yet, after
some essays and miscarriages, I made me both,
and never afterwards wanted either.

How mercifully can the omnipotent Power
comfort his creatures, even in the midst of their
greatest calamities! How can he sweeten the
bitterest afllictions, and give us reason to mag-
nify him in dungeons and prisons! What a
bonnteous table did he spread in the wilderness"
for me, whereI expected nothing at first but to

perish with hunger!

My dog, my parrot, and my cats, served me'
as companions: the parrot became particularly
amusing, as he learned to speak with wonderful
facility, and his sayings enlivened the dreary so-
litude around me.

It would have diverted any one to see me and

N
my little family sit down to dinner. There was
myself, the prince and lord of the island, ato'
tended by my train of servants; Poll, as if he
had been my favourite, was the only one per-'
mitted to talk to me. My dog always stationed
himself at my right hand; and my two cats
waited one on each side of the table, expecting
now and then a bit from my hand as a mark of
my special favour.

Meanwhile my stock of clothes was all worn
out. I had patched and botched them together
as long as I possibly could, but they were no
longer in a condition to bear mending. I had
carefully saved and dried all the skins of the
animals I had killed for my subsistence, and of
these, although a very indifferent taylor, I made
me a complete suit of clothes, and a cap with
the hair turned outwards.

Had any one in England met such a man as
myself, so equipped as I now was, he must have
been a very bold man indeed if he had not been
thoroughly frightened. And as I viewed myself,
I often laughed to think what wonder, terror, and '
astonishment, I should create walking through
the streets of London in such a figure.

First, I had a great high shapeless cap, made
of goats' skin, with a flap hanging down behind,
to keep the rain or sun from my neck. I had a
short jacket of goats' skin; and a pair of loose
breeches, made of the skin of an old goat, the
hair of which was so longthat it hung to the
middle of my legs. Stockings and shoes I had
none, but I had made me a pair of somethings to
lace on, like spatterdashes, but of a most bar-
barous shape, as indeed were all my clothes.
Round my waist was a belt of dried goats'
skin, in which was placed a saw and hatchet,
Another belt went over my shoulder, from which
hung two ugly-shaped goatvskin pouches; one
for my powder, and the other for my shot. At
my back I carried my basket, on. my shoulder
my gun, and ' over my head a great clumsy goat-
skin umbrella, I had made with great difiiculty,
to shield me from the intense heat of the sun,
My upper lip was adorned with a large pair of
Mahometan whiskers. I will not say these mus-3
taches, or whiskers, were large enough to hang

my hat upon; but they were of a length and

shape monstrous enough, and such as in Eng-

land would have passed for frightful. But all

this was of no consequence; for, alas, there were

none to observe, praise, or find fault with me!
P? .2 ..
This fatal idea would sometimes cross me sud-
denly in the midst of my occupations, with an
anguish almost beyond endurance, and my heart
then seemed ready to break, as I reflected that
I was tar from the dwellings of my fellow men,
and imprisoned by the eternal bars and bolts. of
the surrounding ocean! On these occasions
tears gene 'ally relieved me; and my griet'haring
exhausted itself, I became again reconciled to my
hapless destiny.

Now again I proceeded on my travels about
the island. I first journeyed along the sea-
shore, directly to the place where I first; brought
my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks. But
having now no boat to take care of, I went over
land a nearer way to the same height that I was
before upon; when looking forward to the point
of the rock which lay out, and which I was
forced to double with my boat, I was amazed to
see the sea so smooth and quiet, there being no

rippling motion or current any more than in other
places. This made me ponder some time to
guess the reason of it, when at last I was con-
vinced that the ebb setting from the west, and
joining with the current of the water from some
great river on shore, must be the occasion of
these rapid streams; and that consequently as
the winds blew more westwardly or more south-
wardly, so the current came the nearer or went
the. farther from shore. To satisfy my curiosity
I waited there till evening, when the time of
ebbing being come, I plainly perceived from the
rock the current again as before, with this dif-
ference, that. it ran farther at? near half a league
from the shore; whereas in my expedition it set
close upon it, furiously hurrying me and my
canoe along with it, which at. another time it
would not have done. And now I was con-
vinced that, by observing the ebbing and flowing '
of the tide I might easily bring my boat round
the island again: but when I began to think of
putting it in practice, the remembrance of the
late danger struck me with such horror, that
Ichanged my resolution, and formed another,
which was more safe, though more laborious;
and this was, to make a second canoe, and so
have one for one side of the island, and one for
the other.

I had now two plantations in the island, the

first my little fortification, fort, or castle, with
many large and spacious improvements: for by
this time I had enlarged the cave behind me

N3
with several little caves, one 'within another, to
hold my baskets, corn, .and straw; the piles
with which I made my wall, were grown so lofty
that they obscured my habitation; and near
this commodious and pleasant settlement lay my
well-cultivated and improved com-fields, which
kindly yielded me their fruits in the proper
season.

My second plantation was that near my coun-
try-seat, or little bower, where my grapes flou--
rished, and where, having planted many stakes,
I made inclosures for my goats, so strongly for-
tified by labour and time, that it was much
stronger than a wall, and consequently impossi-
ble for them to break through. As for my bower
itself, I kept it constantly in repair, and cut the
trees in such a manner as made them grow thick
and wild, and form a most delightful shade.

In the centre of this stood my tent, thus
erected: I had driven four piles in the ' ground,
spreading over it a piece of the ship's sail; be-
neath which I made a sort of couch with the
skins of the creatures I had slain, and other
. things; and having laid thereon one of the sailor's
blankets, which I had saved from the wreck

of the ship, and covering myself with a great1 .'v I ' K -'4

watch-ycoat, I took up this place for my country
retreat. .

Very frequently from this settlement Ivisited
my boat, and kept her in very good order; and
sometimes I would venture in her a cast or two
from the shore, but no farther, lest either a

strong current, a sudden stormy wind, or some
unlucky accident should hurry me from the
island as before. But now I entreat your atten-
tion, whilst I proceed to inform you of a new
but most surprising scene of life, which here
befel me.

You may easily suppose, that, after having
been here so long, nothing could be more
amazing than to see a human creature. One
day it happened, that, going to my boat, I saw
the print of a man's naked foot very evident on
the sand, as the toes, heel, and every part of
it, were visible. .

Had I seen an apparition in the most (right;
ful shape, I could not havebeen more confound-
ed: my willing ears gave the strictest attention:
I cast my eyes around, but could not satisfy
either the one or the other. I proceeded .
alternately to every part of the shore, but
equally in vain; neither could I discover any
other mark though the sand about it was as
succeptible to take impression, as that which
was so plainly stamped.

Thus, struck with confusion and horror, I
returned to my habitation," frightened at every
bush and tree, taking every thing for men; and
possessed with the wildest ideas. That night
my eyes never closed. 1 formed nothing but
the most dismal imaginations, asking myself a
thousand times, how any mortal could come to
this island. Where was the ship that trans-
ported them? And what signs of any other

foot-steps? At length, Iconcluded that some
wild savages of the main land over against me,

venturing too far in the ocean, had been driven
here, either by the violent currents or contrary
winds; and, not caring to stay on this desolate
island, had gone back to the sea again.

Happy indeed, thoughtl to myself, that none
of the savages had seen me in that-place; yet
I was not altogether without fear, lest, having
found my boat, they should return in numbers
and devour me, or at least carry away all my
corn, and destroy my flock of tame goats: in
a word, all my religious hopes vanished, as
though I thought God could not now protect
me by his power, who had wonderfully preserved
me so long.

What various chains of providence there are
in the heart of man! How changeable are our
affections, according to different circumstances!
"'e love to-day what we hate to-morrow; we
shun one hour what we seek the next. This
was evident with me in the most conspicuous
manner; for I, who before had so much la-
mented my condition in being banished from all
human kind, was now even ready to expire, when
I considered that a man had set his foot on this

desolate island.
But when I considered my station of life 'de-

creed by the infinitely wise and good providence
of God; that I ought not to dispute my Crea-
tor's sovereignty, who had an unbounded right
to govern and dispose of his creatures as he
thinks convenient; and that his justice and mer-
cy could either punish or deliver me: I say,
when I considered all this, I found it my duty
to trust sincerely in him, pray ardently to him,
and humbly resign myself to his divine will.
One morning, lying on my bed, these words
of the sacred writings came again into my mind,
" Call upon me in the day of trouble and I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." Upon
this sentence, rising more cheerfully from my
bed, I offered up my prayers in the most hearty
manner; and when Ihad done, taking up my
bible to read, these words appeared first to my
sight: " "'ait'on the Lord, and be of good
cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart; wait
I say on the Lord." Such divine comfort did
this give, as to remove all cause of sadness upon
that occasion.

Thus, after a world ofapprehensions and fears,
for three days and three nights, I at last ventured
out ofmy castle, and milked my goats, one of
which was almost spoiled for want of it. I next
(though in great fear) visited my bower, and
milked my flocks there also; when growing
bolder, I went down to the shore again, and
measuring the print of the foot to mine, to see
perhaps whether I myself had not occasioned
that mark, [found it much superior in large~
ness; and so returned home, now absolutely
convinced, that either some men had been on
shore, or that the island must be inhabited; and
therefore that I might be surprised before I was
aware.

I now began to think of providing for my se-
burity, and resolved in my mind many schemes
for that purpose; I first proposed to cut down
my inclosures, and turn my tame cattle wild into
the woods, that the enemy might not find them,
and frequent the island in hopes of killing the
same. Secondly, I was for digging up my corn-
iields for the very same reason. And lastly, I
determined to demolish my bower, lest, seeing
a place of human contrivanee, they might come
farther, and find out and attack me in my little
castle.

Such notions did the fear of danger suggest
to me; and I looked, I thought, like the unfor-
tnnate king Saul, when not only oppressed by
the Philistines, but also forsaken by God him-
self. And it is strange that, a little before, hav-
ing entirely resigned myself to the will of God,
1 should now have little confidence in him, fear-
ing those more who should kill this fading body,
than he who could destroy my immortal soul.

However, my fear made me think of a place
for retreat upon an attack. I now repented that
I had made my door to come out beyond my
fortification; to remedy which, I resolved to
make me a second one. I fell to work, there-

fore, and drove betwixt that double row of .
trees, which I! planted about twelve years befbre,
several strong piles, thickening it with pieces of
timber and old cable, and strengthening the foot
of it with earth which I dug out of my cave; I
also made me several holes, wherein I planted my
mnskets like cannon, fitting them in frames re-
Sembling carriages. This being finished, with
indefatigable industry, for a great way every
where around, I planted sticks of osier like a
wood, about twenty thousand of them, leaving a
large space between them and my wall, thatl
might have room to see an enemy, and that they
might not be sheltered among the young trees if

they offered to approach the outer wall.
Scarcely two years had passed over my head,

when there appeared a lovely shading grove, and
in six years it became a thick wood perfectly
impassable. For my safety I left no avenue to
go in or out; instead of which] set two ladders,
one to a part of the rock which was low and
broken in, leaving room for to place another
ladder upon that, so that, when I took these
down, it was impossible for any man to descend
without hurting himself; and if he had, he would
still be only at the outside of my outer wall.

All this labour was occasioned merely by fear-
m1 apprehensions, on account of seeing the print
of a man's foot. And not contented yet. with
whatI had done, I searched for another place
towards the west point of the island, where I
might also retain another flock; then, wandering
on this errand more to the west of ' the island
than ever I had yet done, and casting my eyes
towards the sea, methought I perceived a boat
at a great distance; but could not possibly tell
what it was, for want of my perspective glass.

I considered then that it might be no strange
thing to see the print of a man's foot; and, con-
cluding them cannibals, blessed God for my
being cast on the other side of the island, where"
none of the savages, as I thought, ever came.'
When I came down the hill to the shore, which
was the S. W. point of the island, I was soon '
confirmed in my opinion ; nor can any one de-
scribe my'hbr'ror and amazement, 'vv'ben Isaw
the ground spread with sculljt hands, feet, and
bones of human bodies, and particularly I perc
ceived a space like a circle, in the midst of
which liad been a fire, about which I conjectured
these wretches had sat, arid unnaturally sacrificed '
and devoured their fellow-creature's." " " ' '

The horror and loathsomen'ese of this dread-

0146 arm-:N'ronrs or

ful spectacle confounded my senses. [returned
towards my habitation,and in my way thither
shed floods of tears; and falling down on my
bended knees, gave God thanks for making my
nature contrary to that of these wretches, and
delivering me so long out of their hands.

And although in process of time my dreadful

apprehensions began to wear away, yet my eyes
were more vigilant, for fear of being surprised
and l was very cautious of firing my gun, lest
being heard by those creatures, they should pro-
ceed to attack me. I resolved, however, man-
fully to lose my life if they did, and went armed
with three pistols stuck in my girdle, which, ad-
ded to the description I have given of myself
before, made me look with a very tbrmidable
appearance.

My circumstances for some time remained very
calm and undisturbed; and when I compared
my condition to others, 1 found it was far from

being miserable. And, indeed, would all per-
sons compare their circumstances, not with those _
above them, but with those innumerable unhappy
objects beneath them, I am sure we should not
hear those daily murmurings and complainings
that are in_th_e world. For my part, my whole"
thoughts were employed day and night in think-
ing how I might destroy some of these cannibal:
when proceeding to their bloody entertainments ;
and so savea victim from being sacrificed, that
he might become my servant. Many were my
contrivances for that purpose, and as many ob-
jections occurred after I had determined on
them.

But having waited in vain two or three months,
without any opportunity occurring of puttlng my
projects into execution, it not only grew very
tiresome to me, but brought me into some con-
sideration, and made me examine myself as to-
what right I had to kill these creatures in. this
manner. '

If, urged I to myself, that this natural custom
of theirs was a sin offensive to Heaven, it belongs.
to the divine Being, who alone has the vindictive
power in his hands, to shower down his ven-
geance upon them: and, perhaps, he does so in
making them become one another's executioners.
' Or, if not, if God thinks these doings just, ac-
cording to the knowledge they conceive, what
authority have I to pretend to thwart the de-
crees of Providence, Which has permitted these
actions for so many ages, perhaps from almost

0 2
the beginning of the creation? They never of.
fended me, what right have Ithen to concern
myself in their shedding one another's blood?
I have since learned, that they think no more
of killing and devouring a captive taken in
war, than we do of killing an ox or eating
mutton.

Indeed, religion too convinced me that it was
not my duty to be guilty of shedding human
blood, that] had nothing to do with their pu-
nishment, but ought to leave it to the God ofall
power and dominion, to do therein what seemeth
convenient to his heavenly wisdom. And there- -'
fore, on my knees, I thanked the Almighty for
delivering me from blood-guiltiness, and begged
his protection, that I might never fall into their
hands.

Having thus given over an attempt I had
rashly began, I removed my boat, which was
on the other side of the island, into alittle cave,

that there might not be any appearance of an
inhabitant upon the island.

My castle now became my cell, keeping al~
ways retired in it, except when I went out to
milk my goats and order my little flock in the
wood, which was quite out of danger.. ' 0 fl'

The care of my preservation put a period to
all future inventions and contrivances, either for
accommodation or convenience. I now dared
not to drive a nail, chop a stick, fire a gun, or
make a fire, lest either the noise should be heard,
or the smoke discover me: and on this occount
I used to burn the earthenware privately in a
cave which lfound in the wood, and which I
made convenient for that purpose.

The cause that first brought me to the cave
was to make charcoal, so that I might dress my
bread and meat without any danger. At that
time a curious accident happened to me, which
I shall now relatez--While I was cutting down
wood for making my charcoal, I perceived a ca-

vity behind a thick branch of underwood: cu~
rious to look into it, I attained its mouth, and

perceived it sufficient for me to stand upright
in; but when I had entered and took a further
view, two rolling shining eyes, like flaming stars,
seemed to dart themselves at me; so that I.
made all the haste out that I could, not knowing
whether it was a savage or a monster that had.
taken up his residence in that place.

When I recovered a little from my surprise, I
called myself a thousand fools, and, resuming

03
all the courage I had, I took up a flaming fire-
brand, and in I rushed again.

' I had not proceeded above three steps when
I was more afl'righted than before; for then I
heard a very loud sigh, like that of a human
creature in the greatest agony, followed by a
broken noise, resembling words half expressed,
and then a deep sigh again. Stepping back--
Lord thought I to myself, where have I got!
lnto what enchanted place have I plunged my-
self, such as are reported to contain miserable
captives, till death puts an end to their sorrow!
And, indeed,- such a great amazement was I in,
that it struck me into a cold sweat; and had

my hat been on my head, I believe my hair
would have moved it off.

But again encouraging myself with God's pro-
tection, I proceeded forward, and, by the light
of my firebrand, perceived it to be a monstrous
he-goat, lying on the ground, gasping for life,
and dying of mere old age. At first I stirred
him, thinking to drive him out, and the poor
ancient creature strove to get upon his feet, but
was not able; so I even let him lie still. I now
looked round me, and found the place but small

and shapeless. At the further end of it I per-
MASTER--" Well, Friday; and does your:
nation also eat the men they take in battle?"
FRIDAY--" Yes."
MASTER--" Where do they carry them 7."
FRIDAY--" Other place; many place."
MASTER----" Do they ever come hither?"
FRIDAY--" Yes, and other else place."
MASTER--" Have you been here with them '2"
F RIDAY--" Yes, Ibcen here, there." '
He pointed to the side ofthe island where I
saw the print of the foot, and when .I carried
him thither, he shewed me the place where they
had once destroyed twenty men, two women, and
one child, all prisoners of war. He could not.
count twenty in English, but numbered them by
laying so many stones in a row. It was distress-
ing to me to think, that a creature so intelligent,
and of so good and amiable a disposition, should
delight in such horrid repasts. I took the greatest
pains to convince him of the depravity of such
an abominable custom; and after being with me
some time he seemed to entertain as great a-dis-
gust of the practice as I could wish.
The simplicity,tenderness, and unfeigned ho-
nesty of Friday's disposition, endeared him to me
more and more every day; and on his side, he
loved me more than he had ever loved any thing
before. He was handy, alert, and useful; and
so particularly diligent and merry, that my life
became not merely easy, but pleasant also.
Although Friday had seen me kill the savage
that was his pursuer, he had no idea yet how it
was done. One day, having loaded my gun pri-
vately, I took him out with me into the woods;
and seeing as we passed along a she-goat with two
kids lying by her, I caught Friday by the arm,
bid him stand still, and levelling my piece, shot
one of the kids. The poor fellow looked so
amazed, I thought he would have sunk on the
ground. He did not perceive that I had killed
the kid, but tore open his jacket to look for his
own wounds. He then fell on his knees, entreat--
ing I would spare his life! Ilaughed at him,
and shewed him the kid; and while he was look-
ing at it with extreme wonder and emotion, I re-
loaded my gun, and calling him to look at a fly-
ing bird, I instantly brought it to the ground."
His astonishment at this engine of destruction
did not wear off for a long time; and when he-
was left alone beside the gun, he used to kneel
down, and beseech it not to kill him. After we '
became more intimately acquainted I explained
oeived a sort of an entrance, yet so low as must
oblige me to creep on my hands and knees to
it; so, having no candle, I suspended my enter-
prise till the next day, and then I came provided
with two large ones of my own making.

Having crept upon my hands and feet through
this strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I
think about twenty feet; but surely never mor-
tal saw such a glorious sight before. The roof
and walls of this. cave reflected a hundred thou-
sand lights to me from my two candles, as though
they were indented with shining gold, precious _
stones, or diamonds. The floor was dry and
level, and had a kind of gravel upon it; no nau-
seous or venomous creatures were to be: seen

there, neither was there any damp or wet
about it. I could find no fault but in the en-

trance; and I began to think that even this
might be very necessary for my defence, and
therefore resolved to make it my most principal
magazine.

I I brought hither" two fowling pieces and three
muskets, leaving only five pieces at my castle,
planted in the manner of cannon. From a bar-
rel of gun-powder which I took up on (f the
sea, I brought away about sixty pounds of good
powder, which were not damaged; and these,
with a great quantity of lead for bullets, I re-

moved from my castle to this retreat, now forti--
fied'both by art and nature.

But I must not forget the old goat who caused
my late dreadful amazement. The poor creature

died the day after my discovery; and it being
very difficult to drag him out, Iburied him in
the cave.

I was now in the twenty-third year of my
reign, and my thoughts were much easier than

formerly. By this time my parrot had learned
to speak English, and pronounce his words very

articulately and plainly; so that for many hours
we used to chat together after a very familiar
manner, and he lived with me no less than
twenty-six years. My dog, who was nineteen
years old, sixteen of which he lived with me,
died of mere old age. As for my cats, they
multiplied so fast, that I was forced to drive
them into the woods, except two or three which
became my particular favourites.

Besides these, I continually kept two or three
household kids about me, whom I learned to feed
out of my hand; and two more parrots, who could
talk indiferently, and call Robinson Crusoe, but
not so well as the first; all which made my
abode very agreeable.

~ But what unforeseen events suddenly destroy
the enjoyments of this uncertain state of life,
when we least expect them! It was now the
month of December, in the southern solstice,
and the particular time of my harvest, which re-
quired my attendance in the fields: when going
out pretty early one morning; before it was day-
light, there appeared to me, from the sea-shore,
a flaming light, about two miles from me, at the
east end of the island, whereI had observed
some savages had been before, not on the other
side, but, to my great aflliction, it was on my
side of the island.

Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual
apprehensions, that the savages would perceive
'my improvements, I returned directly to my
castle, pulled up the ladder after me, making all
things look as wild and natural as I possibly
could. In the next place I put myself in a pos.
ture of defence, loading my muskets and pistols;
and committing mySelf to God's protection, I
resolved to defend myself till my last breath.
Two hours after, impatient for intelligence, I set
my ladder up to the side of the hill, where there
was a flat place; and then pulling the ladder up
after me, ascended to the top, where laying my-
self on my belly, with my perspective glass, I
perceived no less than nine naked savages, sitting
round a fire, eating, as I supposed, human flesh,
with their two canoes hauled on shore, waiting
for the flood to carry them off again.

You cannot easily express the consternationl
was in at this sight, especially seeing them so
near me; but when I perceived their coming must
always be with the current of the ebb, I became
more easy in my thoughts, being very fully con-
vinced, thatImight go abroad with security all
the time of the flood, if they were not before landed.
And indeed this proved just as I imagined; for
no sooner did they all take boat, and paddle
away, but the tide made north-west. Befsre they
went ofi', they danced, making ridiculous pos-
tures and gestures, for above an hour, all stark
naked. WhenI saw them gone, I took two guns
upon my shoulders, and placing a couple of pis-
tols in my belt, with my great sword hanging by
my side, I went to the hill, where at first I made '
a discovery of these cannibals, and then saw
there had been three canoes more of these sa- '
vages on shore at that place, which, with the rest,
were making over to the main land.

But nothing could be more horrible, when going
to the place of sacrifice, the blood, the bones, and
other mangled parts of human bodies, appeared
in my sight;' and so fired was I with indignation,
that I was fully resolved to be revenged on the
first that came there, though I should lose my life
in the execution. It then appeared to me, that
the visits they made to this island were not very
frequent, but still I was uneasy, and had dismal

apprehensions of their surprising me unawares:
nor dared I fire a gun on that side of the island

where theyused to appear, lest, taking the alarm,
the savages might return with many hundreds of

canoes, and then God knows in what manner I

should have made my end. Thus was I a year
or more. before I saw any of these devouring can:

nibals again.
.But the following accident, which demands

attention, for a while eluded the force of my_
thoughts m revenging myself on those heathens.

On' the 16th of May, (according to my wooden .
calendar) the. wind blew exceedingly hard, ac.
companied with abundance of lightning and thun-
der all day, and was succeeded by a very stormy
night. The seeming anger of the heavens made
me have recourse to my bible: whilst I was seri-
ously pondering upon it, I was suddenly alarmed
with the noise ofa gun, which I conjectured was
fired upon the ocean. Such an unusual sound
made me start up in a minute, when, with my
ladder, ascending the mountain as before, that
very moment a flash of fire presaged the report
of another gun, which I presently heard, and
found it was from that part of the sea where the
current drove me away. '

I could not but then think, that this must
be a ship in distress, and that these were the
melancholy signals for a speedy deliverance.
Great indeed was my sorrow upon this occasion;
but my labours to assist them proved altogether
vain and fruitless. However, [brought together
all the dry wood that was at hand, and making
a pretty large pile, set it on fire, on the hill. I
was certain they plainly perceived it, by their
firing another gun as soon as it began to blaze,
and after that several more from the same quarter.
All night long I kept up my fire; and when the
air cleared up, I perceived something a' great "way
at sea, directly east, but'could not distinguish
what it was, even with my glass, the weather
was so very foggy out at sea. However, keep-
ing my eyes directly fixed upon it, and perceiv-
ing it not to stir, l presently concluded it must
be a ship at anchor: and so eager was '1 to be
satisfied, that, taking up my gun, I went to the
south-east part of the island, to the same rocks
where 1 had been formerly driven away by the
current; in which time the weather being per-
fectly cleared up, to my great sorrow I per-
ceived the wreck of a ship castaway upon those
hidden rocks] found when [was out with my
boat: and which by making an eddy, were the
occasion of my preservation.

Thus, what is one man's safety is another's
ruin; for undoubtedly this ship had been driven

on them in the night, the wind blowing strong at
B. N. E. Had they perceived the island, as!
now guessed they had not, instead of having
fired their guns for help, they would rather have
ventured in their boat, and saved themselves that
way.~ I then thought, that perhaps they had

done so, upon seeing my fire, and were cast
away in the attempt; for I perceived no boat in

the ship.
But then again I imagined, that perhaps they
1'
had another vessel in company, which, upon sig-
nal,. sm \ed their [Ives and took the boat up; or
that the boat might he driIen into the main
ocean, where these poor creatures might be in
the most miserable condition.

When I considered seriously every thing con-
coming this wreck, and could perceive no room
to suppose any of them saved, I cannot. explain
by any possible. force of words, what lonwings
my soul felt, otten bre akin" out in this manner:
0 that. there had been but two or three, nay,
even one person saved, that. we might have lived
together, conversed with, and comforted one
another.

I had the atlliction, some time after, to see.
the corpse of a drowned boy come on shore, at
the. end of the island next the shipwreck; there e
was nothing on him but a seamans waistcoat, a
pair ot open-kueed linen drawers, and a blue

linen shirt, deg but no particular mark to <<mess what

nation he was of. '
'5 I

And now the. calmness ot the sea tempted me
to venture out in my boat to this wreck, not
only to get something necessaIy out ot the ship,
hut l thoIiwht some living creature might: be on

board, wh05e life I might preserve. This had
such an influence upon my mind, that immedi-
ately I went home and prepared every thing ne-
necassry for the voyage, carrying on board
my boat provisions of all sorts, with a good
quantity of rum, fresh water, and a compass:
putting oil, I paddled the canoe along the shore,
till I came at last to the north-east part of the
island, from whence l was to launch into the
ocean: but here the current ran so violently, and i
appeared so terrible, that my heart began to fail
me, foresceing that if I was driven into any of
these eurrents,I might be carried not only out
of the reach or sight of the island, but even ine-
vitahly lost in the boiling surges of the ocean.
So oppressed was I at these troubles, that I
gave over my enterprise, sailing to a little creek
on the shore, where, stepping out, I sat me
down on a rising hill, very pensive and thought-

fnl. I then perceived that t tide was turned,
and the flood came on, whic title it impracti-

cable for me. to go out for {dfinany hours.

That night I reposed niyself in my canoe, co~
vered with my watch-coat instead of a blanket.
I set out with the first of the tide full north, till
I felt the benefit of the current, which carried
me at a great rate eastward, yet not with such

P2
impet.uosit._v as before; so that in two hours' time
I came up to the wreck, which appeared to mea
most melancholy sight.

It seemed to be a Spanish vessel by its build--
ing. stuck t'ast. between two rocks; her stern and
quarter beaten to pieces by the sea, her main-
mast, and loremast were brought otl' by the board;
that is broken short. otl'. .-\s I approached
n 'arer, l perceived a dog on board, who seeing
me, yelped and cried: and no sooner did I call
to him, but the poor creature jumped into the
sea, out of which I took him up, almost. fa-
mished with hunger and thirst; so that, when I
gave him a cake of bread, no ravenous wolf
could devour it. more greedil_\ : and he drank to
that. degree ot't'resh water, that. he would have
burst himself, had I sull'ered him.

The first sight I met with in the ship, were two
men drowned in the cook-room, or tbrecastle, en-
closed iu one auothcr's arms: also I perceived
several chests, which I supposed belonged to the.
seamen, two of which I got into my boat, without
examining what was in tliem.

I could not. otherwise conclude, but that the
ship must have abundance ot'wealth on board, by
what I afterwards found in the chests; but what
had become of the rest of the sailors, I could
not tell: and all the riches of the ship signified
nothing to any body at that time.

Searching farther, I found a cask, containing
about twenty gallons of liquor, which, with some
labour, lgot into my boat. In a cabin were se-
veral muskets, which I let remain there; but
took away with me a great powder-horn, with
about four pounds ot'powder in it. I took also
a tire. shovel and tongs, two brass kettles, a cop-
per pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron, all
which were extremely necessary. And so, with
this cargo, aemmpanied with my dog, lcame
away, the tide serving for that purpose; and the
same evening I attained the. island, after the
greatest. toil and fatigue imaginable.

'l'hat nightl reposed my weary limbs in the.
boat, resolving the next. morning to harbour what
I had gotten in my new-found subterraueous
grotto, and not carry my degargo home to my an-
cient castle. llaving refreshed myself, and got.
all my etl'ects on shore, 1 next proceeded to exa-
mine the particulars.

At the opening of the chest, several things ap-
peared very useful to me: for instance, there
were several good shirts, exceedingly welcome to

P 3
me, and about a dozen and a half of white linen
handkerchiefs and coloured neck-cloths; and in
the till I found three bags of pieces of eight,
about eleven hundred in all, in one of which,
wrapt up in a piece of paper, were six doubloons
of gold, and some. small bars and wedges of the
same metal, which, I believe, might weigh nearly
a pound.

In the other chest, which I guessed to belong
to the gnnner's mate, by the mean circumstances
that attended it, I only found some clothes of
very little value, except about two pounds of fine
glazed powder, in three flasks, kept, as I believe,
for charging their fowling pieces on any occasion;
so that, on the whole, I had no great advantage
by this voyage.

I also found in the seamen's chests about fifty

pieces of eight in rials, but no gold; I therefore
concluded that what I took from the first be-

longed to an officer, the latter appearing to have
a much inferiorperson for its owner. However,
despicable as the money seemed, I likewise
lodged it in my cave, laying it up securely, as I
did the rest of my cargo; and after I had done
all this, I returned back to my boat, rowing or
paddling her along, till I came to my old har-
hour, where I carefully laid her up, and so made
the best of my way to my castle.

When I arrived there, every thing seemed safe
and quiet. And now my only business was to re-
pose myself after my wonted manner, and take
care of my domestic afl'airs. But though I might
have lived very comfortably, wanting for nothing
absolutely needful, yet still I was more vigilant
than usual on account of the savages, never going
much abroad; or if I did, it was to the eastern
part of the island, where, I was well assured, the
savages never came, and where I might not be
troubled to carry that heavy load of weapons for
my defence, which l was obliged to do if I went
the other way.

Two years did I live in this anxious condition,
in all which time, contrary to my former resolu-
tions, my head was filled with nothing but pro-
jects and designs how I might escape from this
island; and so much were my wandering thoughts
bent on a rambling disposition, that, had I the
same boat that I went from Sallee in, I should
have ventured once more to the uncertainty of
the raging ocean.

I cannot, however, but consider myself as one
oftbe unhappy persons, who make themselves
wretched by their dissatisfaction with the sta-
tions which God has placed them in; for, not to
take a view of my primitive condition, and my
father's excellent advice, (the going contrary to
which was, asl may say, my original siu,) the
fiillowing mistakes of the same nature certainly
had been the means of my present unhappy sta-
tion. What business had I to leave a settled
fortune. and well-stocked plantation, improving
and increasing, where, by this time, I might. have
been worth one hundred thousand moidores, to
turn supereargo to Guinea, to fetch negroes,
when time and patience would have. so much cu-
larged my stock at home, as to be able to employ
those whose more immediate business it was to
fetch them home, even to my own door?

But as this is commonly the fate of young
heads, so a serious reflection upon the folly of its
consequences attends the exercise of future years,
when the dear--bought experience of time teaches
repentance.

Thus it wasuith me: but notwithstanding, the
thoughts of my deliverance ran so strongly in my
mind, that it seemed to check all the dictates of
reason and philosophy. And now, to usher in

my kind reader to the remaining part of my rela-
tion, Iflatter myself it will not be taken amiss
to give him an account of my first conceptions of
the manner of escaping, and upon what founda-
tion I laid my foolish schemes.

Having retired to my castle, after my late voy-
age to the ship, my li'igate laid up and secured,
as usual, and my condition the same as before,
except being richer, though I had as little occa-
sion for riches as the Indians of Peru had for gold
before the cruel Spaniards came among them;
one night in March, being the rainy season, in
the four-anil-twentieth year of my solitude, I lay
down to sleep, very well in health, without dis-
temper, pain, or uncommon uneasiness, either of
body or mind, yet notwithstanding, I could not
compose myself to sleep all the night long. All
this tedious while, it is impossible to express what
innumerable thoughts came into my head. I
traced the whole history of my life, from my ut-
most remembrance of things, till I came to this
island; and then proceeded to examine every ac-

tion and passage that had occurred since! had
taken possession ofmy kingdom.

In my reflections upon the latter, I was com-
paring the happy posture of my affairs in the be.
ginning of my reign, to this life of anxiety, fear,
and concern, since I had discovered the print of
afoot in the sand; that while I continued with-

out apprehension, I was incapable of feeling the
dread and terror I now suffered. How thankful
rather ought I to have been for the knowledge of
my danger, since the greatest happiness one can
be possessed of, is to have sufficient time to pro-
vide against it! How stupendous is the good-
ness of Providence, which sets such narrow
bounds to the sight and knowledge of human na-
ture, that while men walk in the midst of so many
dangers, they are kept serene and calm, by hav-
ing the event of things hid from their eyes, and
knowing nothing of those many dangers that
surround them, till perhaps they are dissipated
and vanish away!

When I came more particularly to consider of
the real danger! had for so many years escaped;
how I had walked about in the greatest security
and tranquillity, at the time, perhaps, when even
nothing but the brow ofa hill, a great tree, or
the common approach of night, had interposed
between me and the destructive hands of the can-
nibals, who would devour me with as good an

"appetite as I would a pigeon or a curlieu ; surely
all this, I say, could not but make me sincerely
thankful to my great Preserver, whose singular
protection I acknowledged with the greatest hu-
mility, and without which I must inevitably have
fallen into the cruel hands of those devourers.

I next proceeded to consider the wretched na-
ture of these destroying savages, by seeming,
though with great reverence, to enquire why God
should give up any of his creatures to such inhu-
manity, even to brutality itself, to devour its own
kind.' But as this was rather matter of obstruse
speculation, and as my miserable situation made
me think this of mine the most uncomfortable
situation in the world, I then began rather to
enquire what part of the world these wretches
lived in; how far off the coast was from whence

they came; why they ventured over so far from
home; what kind of boats conveyed them hither;

and why I could not order myself and my busi-
ness so, that I might be as able to attain their
country as they were to come into my kingdom.

But, thought I, how shall I manage myself
when I come hither ?_ What will become of me
if I fall into the hands of the savages, or how
shall I escape from them if they make an attempt
upon me; and supposing I should not fall into
their power, what shalll do for provision, or
which way shall I head my course? These
counter-thoughts threw me into the greatest horror
and confusion imaginable; but then, I still looked
upon my present condition to be the most miser-
able that possibly could be, and that nothing
could be worse, except death. For, thought I,
could I but attain the shore of the main, I might
perhaps meet with some relief, or coast it along
as I did with my boy Xury on the African shore,
till I came to some inhabited country, where I
might meet with some relief, or fall in with some
Christian ship that might take me in; and ifl
failed, why then leould but meet with death,
which would put an end to all my miseries.
'l'hese thoughts, I must confess, were the fruits
of a distempered mind; an impatient temper
made me desperate, as it were, by the long con-
tinuance of the troubles and the disappointments
I had met with in the wreck, where I hoped to

have found some living person to speak to, by
whom I might have. known in what place I was,
and of the probable means of my deliverance.
Thus, while my thoughts were agitated, my rc-
siguation to the will of heaven was entirely sus-
pended: so that I had no power to fix my mind
to any thing, but to the. project of a voyage to
the main-land. And, indeed, so much was I en.
flamed on this account, that it set my blood into
a ferment, and my pulse beat as high as though
I had been in a fever, till nature being, as it were,
fatigued and exhausted with the very thoughts of
it, made me submit myself to a silent repose.

About a year and a half after this, when I
rose one morning, I saw no less than five canoes.
full ofsavages, land on my side of the island. I
retreated into my castle, ready to die with terror.
After a little time, however, hearing no sound
of their approach, I loaded all my muskets, and
elamhered to the top of my hill, with my per-
speetive glass and a gun, taking care to stand so
that I could not be seen from the shore.

The savages had kindled a great fire, around
which they danced with frantic gestures; they
then dragged two poor wretches out of a canoe,
one of whom they immediately killed, and began
to cut him in pieces, while the other victim was
left standing by himself, till they should be ready
for him. The poor creature seeing himself at
liberty fora moment, suddenly started away, and
ran with incredible swiftness directly towards me.

I was terribly frightened, I ,must confess,
expecting the whole body would be instantly in

Q.I70 ravenous or.

pursuit of him; but recovered my courage a' little
when I saw that only three followed, and that he
greatly outstript them in the speed of his run-
ning.

There was between my castle and them a
creek, where! landed my cargoes when I first
came to the island, and there I thought the poor
fellow *would assuredly be taken: but he made
nothing of swimming over it, though the tide
was up, and having reached the opposite shore,
he ran on still faster than before. Two of his
pursuers plunged into the water, but the third,
I suppose, could not swim; for he turned round
and walked back to his companions.

I could no longer forbear making an attempt
to save the life of him who fled; and with a gun
in each hand, I ran swiftly down the hill, and
rushing upon the foremost pursuer, knocked him
down with the butt end of my musket.

I was determined not, if I could avoid it, to
fire, lest the rest of the savages should hear the
report of the gun, and be attracted to the spot.
The other pursuer stopped and stood1 still at a
little distance, and I perceived he was preparing
his bow-and-arrow to shoot me; then I was
obliged to fire, and I killed him on the spot. The.'fi/l/7("// ,' e //////'// - '//'// .

poor savage, though he saw both his enemies
fallen, yet was so afl'righted with the noise and
tire'of my piece, that it was with difficulty I
could prevail on him to approach me. By de-
grees he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down
at every ten or twelve steps, and having come

close up to me, he kissed the ground, and put
my foot upon his head.

I caressed him, and encouraged him all I
could; but there was more work to be done, for
the savage whom I had knocked down was be-
ginning to recover. I pointed and made signs of
his recovery to my savage, as I may call him,
upon which he spoke some words: and though I
did not understand them, yet they were pleasant.
to hear, being the first sound of human voice
(my own excepted) thatI had heard for twenty-
live years! My savage, findingl did not under-
stand his language, made signs to intreat I would
lend him the sword which hung naked in my belt.
I gave it into his hand, and with one blow he cut
011' his enemy's head, which he laid at my feet
with abundance of triumphant gestures. Then
he went up to the other Indian, and was amazed
beyond description to think how I had killed

him so far 011'. He turned him first on one side,
Q 2
then on the other, and examined the wound the
bullet had made in his breast. I called him away
to bury the savages; and he, with uncommon
dexterity, dug with his hands a large hole in the
ground, into which he put both savages, and

covered them carefully up, that their companions
might not find them.

1 then took him home with me, and having
given him bread and raisins, with some. water,
which he seemed greatly to stand in need of, I
pointed him to some rice-straw, on which he laid
down to sleep.

I then went up the hill, and saw through my
glass that his enemies were getting into their ca-
noes. Whether alarmed by the report of the
gun or the. absence of their comrades, I knew
not ; but they rowed away to sea, without making
any search after their lost companions.

My savage was a handsome youth, about twen-
ty-six years of age; the colour of his skin was
tawney ; his hair a as long, not woolly aml curly,
like the the African negroes; he had fine eyes, a
good mouth, and teeth as white as ivory. The qua-
lities ot'his mind surpassed the perfections of his
body. He was the most submissive, gentle, and
nfl'eetionate cr 'ature that ever lived. I made him
clothes of goat-shin, which he found very un-
comfortable at first, having gone naked'all his
life: their use soon, however, became familiar,
and even pleasant to him. I called him by the
name of FRIDAY, for it was on that day that I
saved his life. I caught him to call me master,
to say yes and no; and, by degrees, he learned
my language so perfectly, that he understood
every thing I said to him, and could hold an in-
telligible conversation with me.

with another nation, he was taken prisoner, and
brought to the island to be devoured by his ene-
mies from \vhoml had rescued him; and on this"
occasion the. following dialogue passed between
us;---l asked him whether his nation were ever
conquerors in battle? He smiled, and said
proudly, " My nation always fight most better."
" llow," said I, "came you then to be taken
prisoner?"

FR!DAY---" My nation beat much for all that;
but they, more. than my nation in place where
the was, they take one, two, and three, and me!
My nation beat much in yonder place, where we
no was; there my nation take one, two, great

the mystery, and taught him how to shoot; I
likewise. gave him a knife, and made him a belt

to carry his hatchet in: all of which delighted
him wondertidly.

Being able to converse with Friday on such
equal terms, [related my history to him. It was
particularly gmtifyiug to me to describe to him
the manners and customs of my native country,
his remarks abounded with so much good sense
and honest feelin".

One day when I had been speaking of the
manner in which lcame. to that island, I ended
him to the place where the wreck of the boat
from which I had so mimeulonsly escaped still
lay on the sand. Friday stood musing by it
some time, and at length said, " Me see such
boat like come to place. at my nation, full of
white mans; and we, my nation, save white
mans from drown."

0n questioning him further, I learnedthqt";
there were seventeen white men in thejrbea'ta':
Friday described the boat to me well enough} but
brought me. better to understand him when he
added with some warmth, " We save the white
' mans from drown." Thenl presently asked him

if there were any white mans, as he called them,~

in the boat? "Yes, (he said) the. boat full of
white mans." lashed him how many? He. told
upon his lingers seventeen. lashed him then
what became of them? He answered, " They
live-they dwell at. my nation."

This put. new thoughts into lllyillt'tltli for!
presently imagined that. these might. be the men
belonging to the ship that was east away in sight
of my island, as I now call it: and who, after
the ship was strnek on the I'Ot'lx, and they saw her
ineyiiably lost, had saved themselves in their
boat, and were landed upon that wild shore
among the savages. Upon this, I enquired of
him more partieularly what was become of them '9
He assured me they still lived there; that they
had been there about four years; that: the sa-
vages let them alone, aml gave. them yietnals. I
asked him how it eame to pass they did not. kill
them and eat them? He. said, " No: they make
brother with them." That is, as I understood
him, a truce. And then he added, "They no
eat mans, but when they make the, war tight."
That is to say, they never eat any men, but such
as eome to tight with them, aml are taken in
battle.

It was after this some considerable time, that
being on the top of the hill. at the east side of
the island, from whence, as l have said, I had
in a clear day discovered the main, or continent
of America; Friday, the weather being very se-
rene, looked very earnestly tov'ards the main-
land, and, in a kind of surprise, began jumping
and dancing, and called out. to me, for [was at
Some distance from him. I asked him what was
the. matter? " ()h joy--oh glad! (said he).
There see my country--there my nation !"

I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure
app aired in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and
his countenance discovered a strange eagerness,
as if he had a mind to be in his own country
again; and this observation of mine put a great
many thoughts into my head, which made me at
first not. so easy about my new man, Friday, as l
was before; and lmade no doubt but that it"
Friday could get back to his own nation again,
he would forget all his obligations to me, and
would be lorward enough to give his countrymen
an account of me, and come back perhaps with
a hundred or two of them and make a feast upon
me, at. which he might be as merry as he used to
be with those of his enemies, when they were
taken in war. But I wronged the poor honest
creature very much, for which I was very sorry
afterwards.

However, as my jealousy increased and held
me some weeks, I was a little more circamspect,
and not so familiar and kind to him as before; in
this I was certainly in the wrong too, the honest,
grateful creature having no thought about him
but what consisted of the best. principles, both
as a religious christian, and as a grateful friend,
which appear at afterwards to my full satisfaction.
While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be
sure I was every day pumping him, to see if he
would discover any of the new thoughts which I
suspected were in him: but I found every thing
he said was so honest and so innocent, that]
could trace nothing to nourish my suspicion; and
in spite ofall my uneasiness, he made me at last
entirely his own again; nor did he in the least
perceive that l was uneasy, and therefore I
could not suspect him of deceit.

One day, 'alking up the same hill, but the
weather being hazy at sea, so that we could not
see the continent, I called to him, and said, Fri-
day, do not you wish yourself in your own coun-
try, your owu nation? " Yes, (he said) I be
much oh glad to be at my own nation!" What
would you do there, said I: would you turn wild
again--eat men's flesh again, and be a savage as
you were, before? He looked full of concern:
and, shaking his head, said, " No, no; Friday
tell them to live good, tell them to pray God,
tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle--flesh, milk, no

eat man again."

Why then, said I to him, they will kill you.
He looked grave. at. that, and then said, "No,
they no kill me: they willing lore. learn." lle
meant by this they would he willing to learn.
He added, "They learned much ofthc bearded
mans that came in the boat."

Then I asked him if he would go back to
them? He smiled at that, and told me he could
not swim so far. I told him lwould makea canoe
for him. He. told me he would go, if I would
go with him. I go, said 1: why they will eat
me if 1 come there! "No, no; (says he) me
make they no eat you--me make they much love
you." He meant, he would tell them howl had
killed his enemies, and saved his life; and so he
would make them love me. Then he told me, as
well as he could, how kind they were to the se-
venteen white men, or bearded men, as he called
them, who came to shore there in distress.
From this time, I confess, I had a mind to

venture over, and see if I could possibly join
with these bearded men, who, I made no doubt,

were Spaniards or Portuguese; not doubting but,
if I could, we might find some method to escape
from thence, being upon the continent, and a
good company together, better than l could from
an island forty miles off the shore, and alone
without help. So, after some days, Itook Friday
to work again, by way of discourse, and told
him I would give him a boat to go back to his
own nation; and accordingly I carried him to
my frigate, which lay on the other side of the
island; and, having cleared it of water, (for I
always kept it sunk in the. water,) I brought it
out, shewed it him, and we both went into it.
1 found he was a mostdexterous fellow at ma-
naging it, and would make it go almost as swift
again as 'I could. So when he. was in, I said
to him, well, now, Friday, shall we go to your
nation? He looked very dull at my saying so,
which, it seems, was because he thought the
boat too small to go so far. I told him then I had
a bigger; so the next day I went to the place
where the first boat lay which I had made, but .
' which [could not get into the water. He said
it
that was big enough; but then, as I had taken
no care of it, and it had lain two or three and

twenty years, the sun had split and dried it, that

it was in a manner rotten.

Friday told me, such a boat would do very
well, and would carry much enough vittle, drink,
bread; that was his way of talking.

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed
Upon my design of going over with him to the
continent, thatI told him we would go and make
one as big as that, and he should go home in it.

He answered not one word, but looked very grave
and sad. I asked him what was the matter with
him? He asked me again thus: " Why you
angry mad with Friday--what me done? " I
asked him what he meant? I told him I was not
angry with him at all. " No angry, no angry!
(said he, repeating the words several times) Why
send Friday home again to my _ nation?" Why,
said I, Friday, did not you say you wished you
were there? " Yes,,yes, (said he) wish be both
there. No wish Friday there, no master there! "
In a word, he would not think of going there
without me. I go there, Friday! said I. What

shall I do there? He turned very quick upon
me at this. " You do great deal much good:
(said he) you teach wild mans be good, sober,
tame mans; you tell them know God, pray God,
and live new life!" Alas, Friday, said I, thou
knowest not what thou sayest! I am but an ig-
norant man myself. "Yes, yes: (said he) you
teachee me good--you teachee them good." 'No,
no, Friday, said I, you shall go without me:
leave me here to live by myself, as I did before.
He looked confused again at that word; and
waning to one of the hatchets which he used' to
wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it to me.
What must I do with this? said I to him. "You
take kill Friday! " said he. What must I kill
you for? said I again. He returns very quick,
"What you send Friday away for? Take kill
Friday--no send Friday away!" This he spoke
So earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his eyes.
In a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost af-
fection in him to me, and a firm resolution in
him, that I told him then, and often after, that
I would never send him away from me, if "he
Were willing to stay with me.

I still found a strong inclination to attempt my
escape, founded on the supposition that there
were seventeen bearded men there; and there-
fore, without any more delay, I went to work

' R 2
with Friday to find outa great tree proper to fell,
and make a large periagua, or canoe, to under-
take the voyage. There were trees enough in
the island to have built a little fleet, not ot'pe-
riaguas and canoes, but even of good large ves-
sels. But the main thing I looked at was, to get
one so near the water, that we might launch it
when it was made, to avoid the mistake I com-
n.itted at lirst.

At last Friday pitched upon a tree, for I found
he knew much better than I what kind ofwood was
fittest for it; nor can 1 tell to this day what. wood
to call the tree we cut down, except that it was
very like the tree we call fustic, or between that
and the Ncaragua wood; for it was much of the
same colour and smell. Friday was for burning
the hollow, or cavity, of this tree out, to make
it into a boat; but I slicwed him how rather to
cut it out with tools, which, after I had shewed
him how to use, he did very handily: and in
about a month's hard labour we finished it, and
made it very handsome; especially when with our
axes, which I showed him how to handle, we cut
and hewed the outside into the true shape of a
boat. After this, however, it cost as near a
fortnight's time to get her along, as it were, inch
by inch, upon great rollers, into the water: but
when she was in, she would have carried twenty
men with ease.

When she was in the water, and though she
was so big, it amazed me to see with what dexte-
rity and how swift my man Friday could manage
her, turn her, and paddle her along; so I asked

him if we might venture over in her? "Yes;
(he said) me venture over in her very well,
though great blow wind." However, I had a
further design that he knew nothing of; and that
was to make a mast and sail, and to fit her with
an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was
easy enough to get; so I pitched upon a straight
young cedar tree, which I found near the place,
and of which there was great plenty in the
island; and I set Friday to work to cut it down,
and gave him directions how to shape and order it.

But as to the sail, that was my particular care.
I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old
sails, enough; but as I had had them now twenty-

six years by me, and had not been very careful to
preserve them, not imagining I should ever have
this kind of use for them, I did not doubt but
they were all rotten, and indeed most of them
were so. However, I found two pieces which

R3
appeared pretty good, and with these I went to
work, and with a great deal ofpains and awkward
tedious stitching (you may be sure) for want of
needles, I at length made a three-cornered ugly
thing, like what we call in England a shoulder
ofmutton sail, to go withaboom at bottom, and
a little short sprit at the top, such as usually our
ship's long boats sail with, and such as 1 best
knew how to manage; because it was such a one
as I used in the boat in which I made my escape
from Barbary, as related in the first part of my
story. I was near two months perfiirming this
last work, viz. rigging and fitting my mast and
sails; for I finished them very complete, making
a small stay, and a sail, or foresail, to it, to
assist it'we should turn to windward; and, which

was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern

of her, to steer with: and though 1 was but a
lmngling shipwright, yet. as I knew the usefulness,

and even necessity of such a thing, I applied

myself with so much pains to do it, that at last]

brought it to pass though, considering the many

dull contrivances I had for it that failed, I think

it cost me almost as much labour as making the

boat.

After all this was done, I had my man Friday
to teach as to what belonged to the navigation of
my boat; for, though he knew very well how to
paddle a canoe, he knew nothing of what be-
longed to a sail and a rudder; and was the most
amazed when he saw me work the boat too and
again in the sea by the rudder, and how the sail
gybed, and filled this way or that way, as the
course we sailed changed; I say, when he saw
this, he stood like one astonished and amazed.
However, with a little use, 1 made all these
things familiar to him, and he became an expert

sailor, except that as to the compass--l could
make him understand very little ofthat. On the
other hand, as there was very little cloudy wea-
ther, and seldom, or never, any fogs in those
parts, there was the less occasion for a compass,
seeing the stars were always to be seen by night

and the. shore by day, except in the raining sea-
sons, and then nobody cared to go abroad, ei-
ther by land or sea.

I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth
year of my captivity in this place; though the
three last years I had this creature with me ought
rather to be left out of the account, my habita-

tion being quite of another kind than in all the
rest of my time. I kept the anniversary of my
landing here with the same thankfidness to (Sod
for his mercies, as at first; and il' I had such
eause of aeknowledginent at. first, I had much
more so now; havingsueh additional testimonies
of the eare ot'l'rovidenee over me, aml the great.
hopes I had of being elleetually and speedily
delivered; t'orl had an invineible impression
upon my thoughts that. my deliverance was at
hand, and that I should not. be another year in
this place. However, I went. on with my hus-
bandry, digging, planting, feneing. as usual. I
gathered and cured my grapes, and did every
neeessary thing as before.

The rainy season was in the mean time upon
me, when I kept more within doors than at other
times; so I had stowed our new vessel as secure
as we could, bringing her up into the. creek,
where, as I said in the beginning, I landed my
rafts li'om the ship, and hauling her up to the
shore. athigh-water mark. I made my man F ri-
day dig a little doek, just big enough to hold -
her, and just deep enough to give her water to
lloatin; and then, when the tide was out, we
made a strong dam across the. end ol'it, to keep
water out; so she lay dry, as to the tide from
the sea, and to keep the rain otl', we laid a great
many boughs of trees, so thick, that she was as
well thatched as a house; and thus we waited
for the months of November and December, in
which I designed to make my adventure.

When the settled season began to come in, as
the thought. of my design returned with the fair
weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage;
and the first thing I did was to lay by a certain
quantity of prowisions, being the stores for our
voyage; and intended in a week or fortnight's
time to open the dock and launch out our boat.
I was busy one morning upon something of this
kind, when I called to Friday, and bid him go
to the sea shore, and see ifhe could find a turtle
or tortoise, a thing which we generally got once
a week, for the sake of the. eggs as well as the
flesh. Friday had not been long gone, when he
came running back, and flew over my outer wall
or fence, like one that felt not the ground, or
the steps he set his feet on; and before I had

.-time to speak to him, he cried out to me, " Oh
inaster, master,! Oh sorrow! Oh bad !" What's
the matter, Friday 2 said 1. "Oh yonder, there,
(said he) one, two, three canoeuone, two, three ! "

By this way of speaking, lconcluded there
were six; but on enquiry, I found there were
but three. Well, Friday, said I, do not be
frighted. So I heartened him up as well asI
could. However, I saw the poor fellow was
most. terribly scared: for nothing ran in his head,
but that they were come to look for him, and
would cut him in pieces; and the poor fellow

trembled so, that I scarcely knew what to do
with him. I comforted him as well as I could,

and told him I was in as much danger as he,
and that they would kill me as well as him. But
Friday, said I, we must resolve to fight them.
Can you fight, Friday? "Me shoot: (said he)
but there come many great number l" No matter
for that, saidI again, our guns will frighten them
that we do not kill. So I asked him whether, if
I resolved to defend him, he would defend me,
and stand by me, and dojust as I bid him? He
said " Me die when you bid me, master !"

I then went and fetched a good diam of rum,
and gave him; for! had been so very carefulof my
rum, that I had a great deal left. When he had
drank it, I made him take the two tbwling--pieces

which we always carried, and load them with
large swan-shot, as big as small pistol bullets.
Then I took four muskets, and loaded them with
two slugs and five small bullets each; and my
two pistols I loaded with a brace of bullets each.
I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my
side, and gave Friday his hatchet.

When 1 had thus prepared myself, I took my
perspective-glass, and went up to the side of the
hill to see what I could discover; and I found
quickly, by my glass, that there were one-and-
twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes.
I observed also, that they were landed not where
they had done when Friday made his escape; but
nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and
where a thick wood came close almost down to
the sea. This, with the abhorrence ofthe inhu-

man errand these wretches came about, filled me
with such indignation, that I came down again

to Friday, and told him I was resolved to go
down to them and kill them all, and asked him
if he would stand by me? He had now gotten
over his fright, and his spirits being a little raised
with the dram I had given him, he was very
cheerful, and told me as before that he would
die when I bid him.

In this fit of fury, I divided the arms which I
charged, as before, between us. I gave Friday
one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns
upon his shoulder; and I took one pistol and the
other three myself: and in this posture we
marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in
my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag, with
more powder and bullets; and as to orders, I
charged him to keep close behind me, and not to

stir or shoot, or do any thing till l bid him; and
in the mean time not to speak a word. -In this
posture I fetched a compass to my right hand of
near a mile, as well to get over the creek, as to
get into the wood; so that I might come within
shot of them before I should be discovered,
which, I had seen by my glass it was easy to do.

While I was making this march, my former
thoughts returning, I began to abate my resolu-
tion. I do not mean that I entertained any fear
of their number; for as they were naked, unarmed
wretches, it is certain I was superior to them;
nay, though 1 had been alone. But it occured
to my thoughts, What call, what occasion, much
less what necessity l was in to go and dip my
hands in blood, to attack people who had neither
done nor intended meany wrong. These things
were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the
way as I went, that I resolved I would only go
and place myself near them, that l might observe
their barbarous feast, and thatl would act then
as God should direct; but thatunless something
offered that was more a call to me than yet I
knew of, I would not meddle with them.

With this resolution Ientered the wood, and
with all possible wariness and silence, Friday
following close at my heels. I marched tillI
came to the skirt of the wood, on the side which
was next to them; only that one corner of the
wood lay between me and them. Here I called
softly to Friday, and shewing him a great tree,
which wasjust at the corner of the wood, Ibid him
go to the tree and bring me word if he could see
there plainly what they werefioing. He did so,
and came immediately back to me, and told me
they might be plainly viewed there; that they
were allabout their fire, and that a prisoner lay
bound upon the sand, a little from them, which
he said they would kill, and fired all the very soul
within me, when he told me it was not one of
their nation, but one of the bearded men who
had come to their country in the boat.

Upon hearing this my soul was ready to sink
within me; when, ascending up into a tree, I
saw plainly by my glass a white man, who lay
upon the beach of the sea, with his hands and
feet tied with flags, or things resembling rushes,

s
being covered with clothes, and seemed to be
an European. .

From the tree where I took this prospectl
perceived another tree. and a thicket beyond it,
about titty yards nearer to them than where l
was, which, by taking a small circle round, I
might come at undiscovered, and then I should
be within hall'a shot of these devourers. And
this consideration alone, to be more perfectly
revenged upon them, made me withhold my pas-
sion, though I was enraged to the highestylegree
imaginable; when, going back about twenty
paces, lgot behind some bushes, which held all
the way till I came. to the other tree; and then
I ascended a little rising ground, not above
eighteen yards distance from them, and there I
had a full view ofthesc creatures, and I could
perceive all their actions.

Such a sight did then appear as obliged me
not to lose a moment's time. There were no
less than nineteen of these. dr 'adl'ul wretches set
upon the. ground, closely huddled together, ex--
pressing all the delight imaginable at so bar-
barous an entertainment; and they hadjust sent.
the other two to murder this unhappy christian,
and bring him perhaps limb by limb to their lire;
for they were just then going to untie the. bands
from his feet, in order for death, as fetters are
knocked off from the feet of malefactors, before
they go to the place of execution. llereupon,
immediately turning to my man, now, Friday,
said I, mind what I say, fail in nothing, but do
exactly as you see me do: all which he promised
he would perform. 1 set down one of my mus-
kcts and the fowling-pieee upon the ground, and
Friday did the same by his; and with the other
musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding
him to do. the like. Are you ready? said I.
" Yes, master," said he. Why then fire at them,
said I; and that very moment I fired also.

For my part, I killed one and wounded two;
but my man Friday taking his aim much better
than I, killed'two and wounded three. They
were in a dreadful consternation at such an un-
expected disaster; and those who had yet es-
caped our penetrating shot, immediately jumped
upon their feet; but were in such confusion,
that they knew not which way to run or look, not
knowiu g from whence their destruction came. We
then threw down our pieces and took up others,
giving a second dreadful volley ; but as they were
loaded only with swan-shot, or small pistol bullets,

s 2
we perceived only two ofthem fall; but so many
were wounded, that they ran yelling and scream-
ing about, like mad creatures. Now, Friday,
said I, lay down your piece and take up the
musket, and follow me.

He did so with great courage; when, shewing
ourselves to the savages, we gave a shout, and
made directly to the poor victim, who would
haw been sacrificed, had not our first fire obliged
the butchers, with three others, to jump into
the canoe. By my order, Friday fired at them,
at which shot I thought he had killed them all,
by reason of their falling to the bottom of the
boat; however, he killed two, and mortally
wounded a third.

In the meantime I cut the flags that tied the
hands and feet of the poor creature; and lifting
him up, asked him in the Portuguese tongue
what he was ? He answered me in latin, "Chris-
tianus." But so very weak and faint, that he
could scarcely stand or speak. Immediately I
gave him a dram and a piece of bread to cherish
him, and asked him what countryman he was?
He said, "Espanola," and then uttered all the
thankfulness imaginable for his deliverance.

Senhor, said I, with as much Spanish as I was(2'

here, take this sword and pistol, and do what
you can. And indeed he did so with such couo.
rage and intrepidity, that he out two of them to
pieces in an instant, the savages not having the
power to fly for their lives.

'I ordered Friday to run for those pieces we
had left. at the tree, which he brought to me
with great swiftness; and then I gave him my
musket, whilel loaded the rest.

But now there happened a fierce encounter
between. the Spaniard and one of the savages,
who had made at him with one of their wooden
swords; and though the former was as brave as
could be expected, having twice wounded his
enemy in the head; yet, being faint, the Indian
had thrown him upon the ground, and was wrest-
ing my sword out of his hand, which the Spa-
niard very wisely quitting, drew out his pistol
and shot him through the body, before I could
come near him, though I was running to his as-

sistance. As to Friday, he pursued the flying o

wretches with his hatchet, dispatching three;

but the rest were too nimble for him- The Spa-

niard, taking up one of the fowling-pieces,

wounded two, whom, running into the wood,

Friday pursued and killed one; but the other;

The savages in the canoe worked very hard to
get out of our reach, and Friday was as eager in
pursuing them; and indeed I was no less anxious
about their escape, lest, after the news had been
carried to their people, they should return in
multitudes to destroy us. So, being resolved to

pursue them, I jumped into one of their canoes,
and bid Friday follow me; but no sooner was I
in, when, to my surprise, I found another poor
creature bound hand and foot for the slaughter,
just as the Spaniard had been, with very little
life in him. Immediately I unbound him, and
would have helped him up, but he could neither

stand nor speak; but groaned piteously, thinking
he was unbound in order to be slain. Hereupon
1 bid Friday speak to him, and tell him of his
deliverance; when, pulling out my bottle, I made
the poor wretch drink a dram, which, with the
joyful news he had received, so revived his heart,
that he sat up in the boat. ,

As soon as Friday began to hear him speak,
and looked more fully in his face, it would have
moved any one to tears to perceive his uncommon
transports of joy; for he kissed him, embraced
him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed,
jumped about, danced, sung, then cried again,
wrung his hands, beat his face and head, then
sung and jumped about again like a distracted
creature: so that it was a great while before I

could make him speak to me, or tell me what was
'the matter with him; but when he came to the

liberty of his speech, at last he told me it was
his father.
Here indeed I was infinitely moved to see the

dutiful and tender affection of this poor savage
to his aged parent. He would. sit dewu by him
in the boat. open his breast, and hold his father's
head close to his bosom- half an hour together,
to nourish it: Ihen he took his arms and ankles,
II Inch chc stiIl and numbed with binding, and
elIIIIi-d and rubbed Ihem with his hands; by
which means, pcrccivine what the case was, [
"ave. him some rum, which proved oI "rcat be-
neIit. to him.

While. we II III e busy III this action the savages
had gotten almost out oI sieht, and happy it was
we did not pursue them; for Iher re arose from
the north-IIesI, II Inch continued all nieht long,
such a violent storm, Ihat I could not suppose

this I called I riday to me, and asked him if he
had giIen hisI I'IIIheraIIy bread. ' He shook his
head, and said, " None, not one bit--me eat it
up all." So I eaIc him II cake of bread out of
a little pouch I arried for this end. I likewise
gave him a dram for himself, and two or three
bunches of raisins for his father. Both these he
carried to him, for he would make him drink the
drum to comfort him. Anny he then runs out of
the boat, as if he were bewitched, with such an
extraordinary swiftness, that he II as out of In g,ht

as it acre, in an instant; but at his return I per-
ceivcd him slacken his pace, because he had
something in his hand; and this I found to be
as he approached nearer, an earthen jug with
some water to his father, and two more cakes'of
bread, which he delivered into my hands. Being
very thirsty myself, I drank some of the water,
of which, when his father had drank sufficiently,
it more revived his spirits than all the ruml had
given him.

When his father had drank, I called to him, to
know if there were any water left? He said,
"Yes." And I bid him give it to the poor Spa-
niard; who was in as much want of it as his
father; and I sent one of the cakes that Friday
brought to the Spaniard too, who was indeed
very weak, and was reposing himself 'upon a
green place, under the shade of a tree; and
whose limbs were also very stifi', and very" much
swelled witli'the rude bandage he had been tied
with.

When I saw that upon Friday's coming to him
with the water he .sat up and drank, and took
the bread and began to eat, I went to him, and
gave him a handful of raisins. He looked up in
my face, with all the tokens of gratitude and
thankl'nlness that could appear in any counte~
nanee. lb! was so weak, uotwithstamling he
had so exerted himself in the light, that hegeonld
not stand upon his feet. He tried to do it. two
or three times; but was really not. able, his
ankles were so swelled and so painful to him. So
I bid him sit. still. and eaused l'riday to rub his
ankles and bathe. them with rum as he had done
his father's. I observed the poor afleetionate
ereature every two minutes, or perhaps less, all
the while he was here. turned his head about, to
see it' his father was in the same place and pos-
ture as he left. him sitting: and at last he fonml
he was not to be seen. at. which he started up,
and, without speaking a word, tlew with that
swit'tness to him. that one could scarcely perceive
his feet. to touch the ground as he went: but
when he came, he only timnd he lmd lain himself
down to case his limbs. So Friday came back to
me pr 'sently; and I then spoke to'the Spaniard
to let l-'riday help him up it' he could, and lead
him to the boat, and then he should carry him
to our dwelling, where I would take care of him.
Upon which Friday made nothing to take him
upon his back. and so 'arried him to the canoe,
setting him close by his father; and presently
stepping out again, launched the boat 03', and
paddled it along the shore faster than I could
walk, though the wind blew very hard too; and
having brought them safe to the. creek, away he
runs to fetch the other canoe, which he brought
to the creek almost as soon as] got to it by land;
when waiting me over, he took our new guests
out of the boat. llut so weak were they, that l
was forced to make a kind of hand-barrow; and
when I came to my castle, not being willing to
make an entrance into my wall, we made them a
handsome tent, covered with old sails and boughs
of trees, making two good beds of rice-straw,
with blankets to lie upon and cover them. Thus
like an absolute king, over subjects who owed
their lives to me, I thought myself very great,
especially considering] had three religions in my
kingdom; my man Friday being aprotestant, his
father a pagan, and the Spaniard a papist; but
I gave liberty of conscience to them all.

To get provisions for my poor weak subjects, I
ordered Friday to kill me a yearling goat, which
when he had done it, I cut oli'the hinder iluar-
ters, and chopping it into small pieces, boiled
and stewed it, patting barley and rice into the
broth. This I carried into their tent, set a table,
dined with them myself, and encouraged them.
Friday was my interpreter to his father, and in-
deed to the Spaniard too, who spoke thelanguage
of the savages pretty well. After dinner I order-
ed Friday to fetch home all the arms from the

field of battle, and the next day to bury the
dead bodies, which he did accordingly.

And now I made Friday enquire of his father
whether he thought those savages had escaped
the late storm in their canoe; and if so, whether

they would not return with a power too great for
us to resist? He answered, that he thought it

impossible they should outlive the storm; or if

they were driven southwardly, they would come
to a land where they would as certainly be de-
voured, as if they were drowned in the sea; and

suppose they had attained their own country, the
strangeness of their bloody and fatal attack

would make them tell their people that the rest
of them were killed by thunder and lightning,
not by the hand of man, but by two heavenly.
spirits, (meaning Friday and me) who were sent
from above to destroy them; and this he said he

knew, because he. heard them say the same to one
another And indeed he was in the right on it;O
for I have heard since that these four men gave

out, that whoever Went to that enchanted island,
would be destroyed by fire from the Gods.

No canoes appearing some time after, asI
expected, my apprehensions ceased; instead of

which my former thoughts of a voyage took
place, especially when Friday's father assured

me I should have good usage in his country. As
to the Spaniard, he told me that sixteen more of

his countrymen and Portuguese, who had been
shipwrecked, made their escape thither; that
though they were in union with the savages, yet
they were very miserable for want of provisions-
and other necessaries.

When I had asked him about the particulars
of his voyage, he answered that their ship was-
bound from Rio de la Plata to the Havannah;
that when the ship was lost only five men perished
in the ocean--the rest having saved themselves

in the boat, were now landed on the main conti-

nent. And what do they intend to do there?
said 1. He replied, they had concerted measures

to escape by building them a vessel, but they:
had neither tools nor provisions; so that all their.

designs came to nothing. Supposing, said I, .I.
should make them a proposal, and invite them
T
hither, would they not carry me prisoner to New
Spain? He. answered, 'No: for he knew them

to be such honest men as would scorn to act such
inhuman baseness to their deliverer; that, if I

pleased, he and the. old savage would go over to
them, talk with them about it, and bring me an
answer; that they should all swear fidelity to
me, as their leader, upon the holy sacraments;

and that, for his part, he would not only do the
same, but stand by me. to the last drop of his
blood, should there be occasionf

These solemn assurances made. me resolve to
grant them relief, and to send these two over
for that purpose: but when every thing was
ready, the Spaniard raised an objection which
carried a great deal of weight in it. "You
know, sir, (said he) that, being some time with
you, I 'aunot but be sensible of your stock of
rice and corn, sutiieient perhaps for us at pre-
sent, but not for them, should they come over
presently, and much less to vietnal a vessel for
an intended voyage. Want might be as great an
occasion for them to disagree and rebel, as the
children of Israel did against (iod himself, when
they wanted bread in the wilderness: and'there-

{ore my advice is, to wait another harvest, and
in the meantime cultivate and improve some more
land, whereby we may have plenty of provisions,
in order to execute our design."

This advice of the Spaniard [ approved of ex-
tremely; and so satisfied was I of his fidelity,
that I esteemed him ever after. And thus we all

four went to work upon some more land; and
against seed-time. we had got so much cured and
trimmed up, as was sufficient to sow twenty-two
bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice,
which was in short all the seed we had to spare.
As we were four in number, and by this time all
in good health, we. feared not a hundred Indians
should they venture to attack us. And while
the corn was growing, I pitched upon some trees
tit to build us a large vessel in case the Spaniards
came over; which being marked, I ordered Fri-
day and his father to cut them down, appointing
the Spaniard, who was now my privy counsellor,
to oversee and direct the work.

llikewise encreased my flocks of goats, by
shooting the wild dams, and bringing home their
kids to my enclosure; nor did I neglect the
grape-season, but cured them as usual, though I
had such a quantity now as would have filled

eighty barrels. And thus all of us being em-
T2
ployed, they in working, and I in providing for
them, till harvest came, God Almighty blessed
the increase of it so much, that from twenty-two
bushels of barley, we threshed out two hundred
and twenty, and the'like quantity of rice, suffi--
cient to victual a ship to carry me and all the
Spaniards to any part'of America.

Thus, the principal objection being answered
by a sufficient stock of provisions, I sent my two
ambassadors over to the main-land, with a regal
authority to administer the oath of allegiance
and fidelity, and have an instrument signed under
their hands, though I never asked whether they
had pen, ink, or paper; when, giving each of
them a musket, eight charges of powder - and
ball, and provision enough for eight days, they
sailed away with a fair gale, on a day when the
moon was at the full.

Scarcely a fortnight had passed over my head,
but impatient for their return, I laid me down to
sleep one morning, when a strange accident hap-
pened, which was ushered in by my man's com-
ing running to me, and calling aloud, "Master,
master: they are come, they are come l" Upon
which, not dreaming of any danger, out I jumped
from my bed, put on my clothes, and hurried
through my little grove; when, looking towards
the sea, I perceived a boat about a league and a
half distant, standing in for the shore, with the
wind fair. I beheld they did not come from the
side where the land lay on, but from the southern
end of the island: so, these being none of the
people we wanted, I ordered Friday to lie still
till such time as I came down from the mountain,
which with my ladder I now ascended, in order
to discover more fully what they were: and now,
with the help of my perspective glass, I plainly
perceived an English ship, which I concluded it
to be by the fashion of its long boat, and which
filled me with such uncommon transports of joy,
thatI cannot tell how to describe; and yet some
secret doubts hung about me, proceeding from I
know not what cause, as though I had reason to
be on my guard. And' indeed I would have no
man contemn the secret hints and intimations of
danger, which very often are given when he may
imagine there is no possibility of their being
real; for had I not been warned by this silent
admonition, I had been in a worse situation than
before, and perhaps inevitably ruined.

Not long it was before I perceived the boat to
approach the shore, as though they looked for a

T 3
place where they might conveniently land; and
at last they ran their boat on shore upon the
beach, about halfa mile distant, which proved
so much the happier for me; since if they had
come into the creek, they had landedjust at my
door, and might not only have forced me out of
my castle, but plundered me of all I had in the
world. Now! was fully convinced they were
all Englishmen, three of whom were unarmed
and bound; when immediately the first four or
five leaped on shore, and took those three out of
the boatas prisoners; one of whom, lcould per-
ceive, used the most passionate gestures of en-
treaty, affliction, and despair, while the others,
in a less degree, shewed abundance ofconcern.

Not knowing the meaning of this, 1 was very
much astonished; and I beckoned to Friday,
who was below, to ascend the mountain, and
likewise view this sight. "Oh, master, (said he
to me) you see English mans eat prisoners as
well as savage mans!" And do you think they
will eat them, Friday? said I. "Yes, (said
Friday) they will eat all up," No, no, (said I)
Friday--l am much more concerned lest they
should murder them; as for eating them up,
that I am sure they never will.
And now I not only lamented my misfortune in
not having the Spaniard and savage with me, but
also that I could not come within shot of them
unperceived (they having no fire-arms with them)
and save these three men, whom I thought they
were going to kill with their swords. But some
comfort it was to me that I perceived they were
set at liberty to go where they pleased; but they
sat down all three upon the ground very pen-
sive, and looked like men in despair. This put
me in mind of the first time when I came on
shore and began to look about me, how] gave
myself over for lost, how wildly I looked round
me, what dreadful apprehensions I had, and how
I lodged in the tree all night, for fear of being de-
voured by wild beasts. As I knew nothing of the
supply I was to receive by the providential driving
of the ship nearer the land in the storms and tide,
by which I have since been so long nourished
and supported ; so these three poor desolate men
knew nothing how certain of deliverance and
supply they were, how near it was to them, and

how effectually and ready they were in a condi-
tion of safety, at the same time that they thought
themselves lost and their case desperate. So
little. do we see before us in the world, and so
much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon
the great Maker of the world, that he does not
leave his creatures so absolutely destitute, but
that in the worst circumstances they have always
something to be thankful for, and sometimes are '
nearer their deliverance than they imagine; nay,
are even brought to their deliverance by the
means through which they seem to be brought to
their destruction.

The rascally seamen scattering about, as
though they had a mind to see the place; and so
long did they negligently ramble, that the tide
had ebbed so low as to leave the boat aground.
Nor were the two men that were in her more cir-

cumspect, for, having drank a little too much li-
quor, they fell fast asleep; but one of them
waking before the other, and perceiving the boat
too fast aground for his strength to move it, he
hallooed out to the rest, who made all possible
expedition: to come to him: but, as Providence
ordered it, all their force was ineffectual to launch
her, when I could hear them speak to one an-
-other, " Why, let her alone, Jack, can't ye; she'll
.float next tide." By which words I was fully
convinced they were my countrymen.

All this while I lay very quiet, as being fully
sensible it could be no less than ten hours before
the boat would be afloat, and then it would be
so dark, as that they could not easily perceive
me, by which means I should be at more liberty
to hear their mlk and observe all their motions:
not but that 1 prepared for my defence; yet as I .
had now another sort of enemies to combat with,
I acted with more caution. [took two fusees on
my shoulder, and gave Friday three muskets:
besides, my formidable goat-skin coat and mon-
strous cap, made me look as fierce and terrible
as Hercules of old, especially when two pistols
were stuck in my belt, and my naked sword
hanging by my side.

It was my design at first not to make any at-
tempt till it was dark; but it being now- two

o'clock, in the very heat of the day, the sailors
were all straggling into the woods, and undoubt-

edly were lain down to sleep. The three poor
distressed creatures, too anxious to get any repose,
were, however, seated under the shade of a great

tree, about a quarter of a mile from me, and
' before I was perceived I called aloud to them in
Spanish, What are you, gentlemen? '

At these words they started up in great confu-
sion, and beholding the strange figure I made,
they returned me no answer, but seemed as if
they would fly from me. Gentlemen, said I, in
English, don't be afraid: perhaps you have a
friend nearer you than you expect. "He must
'be. from heaven; (said one of them gravely, and
pulling oil' his hat) for we are past all help in
this world." All help is from heaven, said I;
but, sir, as l have perceived every action between
you and those brutes since your landing, only in-
form me how to assist you, and I will do it to
the utmost of my power.

"Am I talking with God or man? (said he, in
tears). Are you of human kind, or an angel 2"
Sir, said I, my poor habit may tell you I am a
man, and an Englishman, willing to assist you,
having but this servant only: here are arms and
ammunition: tell freely your condition, can we
save you! "The story (said he) is too long to
relate, since our butchers are so near. But, sir,
I was master ofthat ship: my men have mutinied,
and it is a favour they have put my mate, this
passenger, and me, on shore, withoutmurdering
us, though we expect nothing but to perish here."
Are your enemies gone? said I. "No: (replied
he, pointing to a thicket) there they lie; while my
heart trembles, lest, having seen and heard us,fl 1"

they should murder us all." Have they fire-arms?
said I. "They have but two pieces (replied he)
one of which is left in the boat." He also told
me there were two enormous villains among them,
that were the authors of this mutiny, who, if
they were killed or seized, might induce the rest
to return to obedience. Well, well, (said I) let
us retire further under the covering of the woods;
and there it was I made these conditions with
them :--

I. That while they staid in the island they
should not pretend to any authority, but be en-
tirely conformable to my orders, and return me
the arms which I should put into their hands.

I]. That if the ship were recovered, they
should afford Friday and me our passage gratis
to England.

When he had given me all the satisfaction I
could desire, I gave each of them a gun, with
powder and ball sufficient, advising that we should
fire upon them as they lay. The captain mo-
destly said he was sorry to kill them; though, on
the other hand, to let these villains escape, who
were the authors of his misery, might be the
ruin of us all, should they bring the ship's com-

pany. upon us. "Well, (said he) do as you think
fit", And accordingly I fired killing one of the
captain's chiefest enemies, and wounding the
other, who eagerly called for assistance: but the

captain, who had reserved his piece, coming up
to him, " Sirrah, (said he) it is too late to call

for assistance: you should rather cry to God to
pardon your villainy." So he knocked him down

with the stock of his gun. Three others were
also slightly wounded, who at my approach cried
out for mercy. This the captain granted, on con-
dition that they would swear to be true to him in
recovering the ship, which they solemnly did:
however, I obliged the captain to keep them

bound.
Afterwards I sent Friday and the captain's

mate to secure the boat and bring away the oars
and sail; when, at their return, three men com-
ing back, and seeing their late distressed captain,
now their conqueror, submitted to be bound
also. And then it was that, having more liberty,
1 related the adventures of my whole life, which
he heard with wonderful attention. Next, Icare
ricd him and his two men into my little fortified
castle, showed them all my conveniencies, and
refreshed them with such provisions asI could
afford. . When this was over we began to think
about regaining the ship. He said that there
were twenty-six hands on board, who, knowing

their lives were forfeited by the law, for con-
spiracy and mutiny, would grow so very hardened,
that it would be dangerous for our small com-
pany to attack them. This was a reasonable in-
ferenee indeed; but something we did resolve on,
and immediately put in execution; for we heaved
the boat upon the beach so high, that she could

not shoot off at high-water mark, and made a
hole in her not easily to be stopped; and so all

the signals they gave for the boat to come on
board were in vain. This obliged them to send
another boat ashore, with ten men armed, whose

faces the captain plainly descried, the boatswain
being the chiefofiicer; but he said there were

three honest lads among them, who were forced
into the conspiracy.

Hereupon I gave him fresh courage, (for I. had
perceived he was in concern) in the meanwhile
securing our prisoners, part in my castle, over
whom Friday stood centinel; two we took into
our service, and then thought ourselves strong
enough to adventure a battle.

When the sailors landed, and beheld their
boat in that condition, they not only hallooed.

l'
but fired for their companions to hear; yet they
received no answer. This struck them with
horror and amazement, thinking their compa-
nions were murdered; then they made as if they
would return to the ship. I could perceive the
captain's countenance change at this, till three
men were ordered to look after the boat, while
the other seven leaped on shore, in order to
search for their companions; and indeed they
came to the brow of the hill near my ancient
castle, from whence they could see a great way
into the woods; and there shouting and hallooing

till tired and weary, at length seated themselves

under a spreading tree.
My opinion was, that nothing could be done
till night, when I might use some artifice to get

them out of the boat: but of a sudden they all
started up, and made to the sea-side. Hereupon

I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go
over the creek into the woods, and halloo as

loud as possible.

This artifice succeeded. The sailors immedi-
ately ran towards the wood, till coming to the
creek, they called for their boat to carry them
over, and then took another man with them into 9

the woods, leaving but two in the boat.
Immediately we surprised the men in the boat;
and ordering them to surrender on pain of death,
and one of them being an honest lad, they threw
down their arms and submitted themselves to
our 'command.

When the sailors returned fi'om a vain and
long search, and found their boat aground in the
creek, the tide out, and their companions gone,

they ran about, wringing their hands, and crying
out, that it was an enchanted island, and they

should all be murdered by spirits or devils.
Friday and the captain crawled towards them
on their hands and knees; and the captain,
taking aim at the boatswain, who was the ring-
leader of the mutiny, killed him on the spot.

Friday wounded another, and a third ran away.
I now advanced with my whole army, and it
being nearly dark, I ordered the two men we had

surprised in the boat to call to them by their
names, and bid them surrender to the captain
and fifty men, or they would all be killed.
Thrown into the greatest consternation, by the
death of the boatswain, and the fear of being
overpowered by numbers, they threw down

their arms and surrendered.
Having bound our prisoners and secured the

U2
boat, I sent the captain, in the name of the go-
vernor of the island, to offer them free pardon,
if they would assist in recovering the ship. To
this they one and all consented; and agreed
among themselves, that whoever attempted to
violate the condition should be hanged upon the
beach. \ ._

_ Both boats were nowgot ready with all possible
expedition, and about midnight the captain, &c.
reached the ship. '

Robinson, one of the prisoners, on whom the
:captain knew he could rely, was ordered to hail
the. ship, and to say that they had at last found
their comrades. '

The crew received them on board, without
any suspicion of the captain being among them;
and in less than half an hour the captain's party
secured every man in the ship, and restored the
government of the vessel to its lawful com-

mander. '
. And thus, the ship being completely recovered,
the joyful signal was fired, which l-heard with
the greatest delight imaginable. Nor was it long
before the grateful captain brought the ship to an
anclmr at the creek's mouth; and hastening on
shore, he threw himself into my arms, exclaim-

iug, " My friend--my deliverer! There is your
ship: she is yours, and we are your servants l"

I was so affected with this most unexpected
event, that I' swooned in his embraces. Having
recovered, I kneeled down upon the beach to
thank the Almighty Disposer of all things for
my miraculous deliverance.

It was useless now to wait for the arrival of
the Spaniards, as it would by no means answer
their purpose to be carried to England. Ithere-
fore wrote in Spanish an account of all that had
befallen me, and placed it in a conspicuous part
of the tent, within my fortified wall.

I left them my habitation, with all its conve-
niencies and utensils; my tools, my flocks of goats,
and all my accumulated stores; and carrying
with me Friday, my parrot, my money, my um-
brella, and goat-skin cap, I bid farewel to the
island, after twenty-eight years, two months,
and nineteen days residence.--We set sail
Dec. 19, 1687, and arrived in England June 11,
1688.

' Here I found my first captain's widow alive;
she had buried a second husband, but in very
mean circumstances, and I made her very

easy on my account. Soon after [went down
to Yorkshire, where all my family were expired,
except two sisters, and as many of one of my
brother's children. I found no provision had
been made for me, they concluding I had been
long since dead; so that I was in but a very
slender situation. Indeed the captain did me a
great kindness by his report to the'owners, of the
manner in which [had delivered their ship on
the desolate island; on which they made me a
present of two hundred pounds. I next went to
Lisbon, taking my man, Friday, with me; and
arriving there in April, I met the Portuguese
captain, who took me on board on the African
coast; but being old, he had left off the sea,
and resigned all his business to his son, who fol-
lowed the Brasil trade. So altered both of us

were, that we did not know each other at first,
till I discovered myself more fully to him. Afier

a few embraces, I began to enquire of my con-
cerns; and then the old gentleman told me that
it was nine years since he had been at Brasil,
where my partner was then living, . but my trus-
tees were both dead; that it was his belief that I
should have a good account of the product of
my plantation; that the imagination ofmy being
lost had obliged my trustees to give an estimate
of my share to the procurator-fiscal, who, in
case of my not returning, had given one third to
the king, and the rest to the monastery of St. Au-
gustine; but if I put in my claim, or any one for
me, it would be returned, except the yearly pro-
duct, which was given-to the poor. I then de-
sired him to tell me what improvement he thought
had been made of my plantation, and whether

be imagined it was worth my while to look after
it? He answered, that he did not know how

much it was improved; but this he was certain
of, that my partner was grown vastly rich upon
his half of it; and that he had been informed
that the king had two hundred moidores for his
third part. He added, that the survivors of my
trustees were persons of an ingenuous character;
that my partner could witness my title, my name
being registered in the country, by which means,
indisputably, I should recover-considerable sums
of money. But, answered 1, how could my
trustees dispose of my effects, when I made you
my only heir? This, he said, was true; but
there being no affidavit made of my death, he
could not act as my executor. However, he had
ordered his son, then at Brasil, to act by pro-

curation upon my account; and he had taken
possession of my sugar-house, having accounted
himself for eight years with my partner and
trustees for the profits, of which he would give
me a very good account.

This he performed very faithfully in a few days,
making himself indebted to me 470 moidores in

gold, over and above what had been lost at sea
after I had left the place. And then he recounted

to me what misfortunes he had gone through,
which forced my money out of his hands to buy

part in a new ship. " But (said be) you shall
not want: take this, and when my son returns
every farthing shall be paid you." Upon which
he put into my hands a purse 0f150 moidores in
gold, as likwise the instrument containing the
title to the ship in which his son was, and which
he offered as security for the remainder. But
really when I saw so much goodness, generosity,
tenderness, and real honesty, Ihad not the heart
to accept it, for fear he should straiten himself on
my account. " It is true (said he) it may be so;
but the money is yours, not mine, and you may
have the greatest occasion for it." However, I
returned fifty of them, promising to give him the
other hundred when I got my efi'ects in my hands,

saying I designed to go myself for that pur-
pose. But he told me he could save me the
trouble; and so caused me to enter my name
with a public notary, as likewise my affidavit
with a procuration affixed to it; and he advised
me to send it in a letter to one of his acquaint-
ance, a merchant at Brasil; and indeed nothing
could be more faithfully and honourably ob-
served; for in seven months' time I had a very
faithful account of all my effects, what sums
were raised, what expended, and what remained
for my use: in a word, I found myself worth
50001. and 10001. per annum. Nor was this all;
for my partner congratulated me upon my being
alive, telling me how much my plantation was
improved, what negroes were at work, and how
many Ace lilarz'as he had said to the Virgin
Mary for my preservation, desiring me to accept
kindly some presents he had sent me, which

shewed the greatest generosity.

No sooner did the ship arrive but I rewarded
my faithful captain, by returning him the hun-
dred moidores: and not only forgiving all
he owed me, I allowed him yearly a hundred
more, and fifty to his son, during their lives.

And now being resolved to go to England, I re-
turned letters of thanks to the prior of St. Au-
gustine, and in particular to my old partner, with
very suitable presents. By the captain's advice
[was persuaded to go by land to Calais, and
there take passage for England. When; as it
happened, I got ayoung English gentleman, a
merchant's son at Lisbon, to accompany me,
together with two English and two Portuguese
gentlemen; so that, with a Portuguese servant,
an English sailor, and my man Friday, there
were nine of us in number.

Thus armed and equipped, we. set out, and
came to Madrid, when, the summer decaying,
we hastened to Navarre, where we were infiirmed
that there was scarcely any passing, by reason of
the prodigious quantity of snow; so that we
were obliged to abide near twenty days at Pam-
peluna, and at last to take a guide to conduct us
safe towards Thoulouse. And now twelve other
gentlemen joining with us, together with their

servants, we had a very jolly company. Away
our guide led us by the frightful mountains, and

through so many intricate mazes and windings,
that we insensibly passed them, which, as we
travelled along, ushered us into the prospect of
the fruitful and charming provinces of Langucdoc
and Gascoigne.
But now came on two adventures, both tragical
and comical. First, Our guide was encountered
by three wolves and a bear, which set upon him
and his horse, and wounded him in three places;
upon which my man, riding up to his assistance,
shot one of them dead, on which the others ran
into the woods. But the pleasantest adventure
was to see my man attack the bear. This crea-
ture, if let alone, will never meddle with you,
and this my man Friday very well knew; and so
begging leave of me, in broken English he told

us he would "make good laugh." Why, you
silly fool, said I, he'll eat you up at a mouthful.
"Eatee me-up! (replied he) Me eatee him, and

make much good laugh 1" Upon which, pulling
off his boots, he claps on his pumps, and run-
ning after the monstrous beast, he called out
that he wanted to speak with him; and then
throwing stones on purpose to incense him, the

beast turns about in a fury, and with prodigious
strides, shufiles after him. But though he could

not keep pace with Friday, who made upto us,
as it were, for help. You blackhead, said I,
immediately take horse, and let us' shoot the

creature. But he cried, "Dear master, no
shoot-- me make you much laugh!" And so he
turned about, making signs to follow, while the
bear ran after him, till coming to a great oak,

he ascended 1n a minute, leaving his gun at the
bottom of it. Nor did the bear make any diffi-
culty of it, but, notwithstanding his bulk, as-
cended like a cat. You must think I was not a
little amazed at the folly of my man, not per-
ceiving any thing to occasiOn our laughter, till
we rode up nearer, and beheld the beast mounted
on the oak, on the beginning of the branch to
which Friday clung at the further end, where the
bear durst not come. Hereupon F1iday cried
out, " Now, master, me make much laugh; me
make de bear dance l" Upon which he fell a
shaking the bough, which made the creature look
behind him, to see how he could retreat. Then,

.5

English, he cried," Why you not come farther,
Mr. Bear? Pray Mr. Bear, come farther!"
And their, indeed, we all burst into laughter;
especially-when we perceived Friday drop like a
squirrel, uponthe ground, leaving the beast to
make the: best of his way down the tree. And

now, thinking it the most convenient time to kill
him, Friday cried out, " Oh dear master, no
shoot: me shoot bye and bye!" When, taking

np his gun, he said, " Me not shoot yet--me
make once more much laugh." An'd accordingly

'he was as good as his word; for the creature

descending backwards from the tree very leisure-
ly, before he could lay one foot to the ground,
Friday shot-him through the ear stone-dead; and

looking to see if we were pleased, burst out into

a hearty laugh, saying, " So we kill bear in my
country; not with gun, but much long arrow."
Thus ended our diversion, to our satisfaction,
especially in a place where the terrible howlings
struck us with continual terror. But the snow
now growing very deep, particularly on the moun-
tains, the ravenous creatures were obliged to seek
for sustenance in the villagesrwhere, coming by
surprise on the country people, they killed seve-Ql'.'
ml of them, besides a great number of their sheep
and horses. .

.Our guide told 'us we had yet one more dan-
gerous place to pass; and if there were any more '
wolves in the country, there' we should [find
them. This was a small plain, encompassed
with woods, to get through a long land, to the
village where we were to lodge. When we en~
tered the wood the sun was within half an hour
of setting; and a little after it was so! 12.0 < me ;

":35 . X -r .
l
into the plain, which was not above two leagues
over; and then we saw five great wolves cross
the road, without taking any notice of us, and so

swift as though they were pursuing their prey.
Our guide, believing there were more coming,

desired us to be on our guard. Accordingly,
about a furlong farther we saw a dead horse, and
near adozen of wolves devouring its carcase. My
man Friday fain would have fired at them, but I
would not permit him. Nor had we gone more
than half a league farther, when we heard dread-
ful howlings in a wood on our left, and saw a hun-
dred coming up against us, as though they had
been an experienced army. This obliged us to
form ourselves in the best manner; and then I

ordered that every other man should fire, that
'those who did not might be ready for a second
volley, should they advance upon us; and then
every man to make use of his pistols. But there
was no necessity for this; for the enemy, being
terrified, stopped at the noise of the fire. Four
of them were shot dead, and several others, being
wounded, went bleeding away, as we could very
plainly discover by the snow. And now, remem-
bering what had been often told me, that such
was the majesty of a man's voice, as to strike
terror even into the fiercest creatures, I ordered

all our companions to halloo as loud as possible :
and in this notion I was not altogether mistaken ;
for they immediately turned about at the first
halloo, and began to retire; upon which, order.
- ing a second volley in their rear, they gaIIOped
into the woods with great precipitation.

Thus we had some small time to load our pieces
again, and then made all the haste we could on
our way. But we had not rode far before we
were obliged to put ourselves in a posture of de-
fence as before, being alarmed with a very dread-
ful noise, in the same wood, on our left hand,

the way that we were to pass, only that it was
some distance from us. By this time dark clouds

began to spread over the sky, and the night came
on apace, which made it so much the more to
our disadvantage; when presently three troops
of wolves, in our front, appeared to our sight,
as though a great number of them had a design
to surround us, and devour us in spite of fate.
As they did not fall upon us immediately, we pro-
ceeded on our journey in the swiftest manner the

roads would permit our horses, which was only

a large trot. It was in this manner we travelled,

till such time as we discovered another wood,
X 2
and had the prospect of its entrance, through
which we were to pass at the farthest side of the
plain. But surely none can express the terror
we were in when, approaching the lane, we per-
ceived a confused number of the fiercest wolves
standing, and, as it were, guarding its entrance.
Nor were we long in this amazement, before an-
other occasion of horror presented itself; for
suddenly we heard the report of a gun at another
opening into the wood; and looking that way,
out ran a horse, bridled and saddled, flying with
the greatest swiftness, and no less than sixteen
or seventeen wolvespursuing him, in order to
devour the poor creature: and unquestionably
they did so, after they had run him down, not
being able to hold out that swiftness by which he
at first escaped them.

When we rode up to that entrance from whence
the horse came forth, there lay the carcases of
two men and another horse, mangled and torn
by these devouring wolves: and undoubtedly one
of these men was the person who fired the gun
which we had heard, for the piece lay by him;
but, alas, most of the upper part of his body
and his head were entombed in the bowels of
these ravenous creatures!Y

What course to take, whether to proceed or
to retreat, we could not tell; but it was not long
before the wolves themselves made us come to a
resolution: for such numbers surrounded us,

every one. of whom expected their prey, that
were our bodies to be divided among them, there

would not be half a mouthful apiece. But happy,
very happy it was for us, that but a little way
from the entrance there lay some very large
timber-trees, which I supposed had been cut down
and laid there for sale, among which I drew
my little troop, placing ourselves in aline behind
one long tree, which served us for a breast-
work; when, desiring them to alight, we stood
in a triangle, or three fronts, enclosing our
horses in the centre, the only place where we
could preserve them.

Never certainly was there a. more furious
charge than what the wolves made upon us in
this place; and the sight of the horses, which
was the principal thing they aimed at, provoked
their hunger, and added to their natural fierce-
ness. They came on us with a most dreadful
noise, which made the woods ring again; and
beginning to mount our pieces of timber, I or-
deer every other man to fire as before directed;

x 3
and indeed so well did they take their aim, that
they killed several of the wolves at the first vol-
ley; but still we were obliged to keep a continual

firing, for they came, pushing one another on
with the greatest fury.

Our second volley something abated their
courage, when, stoppinga little, we hoped they
would have made the best of their way.' How-
ever, it did not prove so; for others made a new
attempt upon us; and though in four firings we
killed seventeen or eighteen of them, laming

twice as many, yet they came on several times
successively, as though they valued not their lives
for the sake of the prey.

Unwilling was I to spend our last shot too
suddenly; and therefore called my other servant,
and, giving him a horn of powder, bid him lay
a large train quite along the timber, which he
did, while Friday was charging-my fusee and his
own with the greatest dexterity. By this time,
the wolves coming up the timber, I set 'fire to

the train, by snapping a discharged pistol close
on the powder. This so scorched and terrified
them, that some fell down, and others jumped
in among us with the strength and terror of the
flames; but these we immediately dispatched,nonmson CRUSOE. 235

when all the rest, frightened with the light,
which the darksome night caused to appear more
dreadful, began at length to retire: upon which,
ordering our last pistols to be fired at once,

giving at the same time a great shout, the wolves
were obliged to have recourse to their swiftness,

and turned tail; and then we sallied out upon
twenty lame ones, cutting them in pieces with
our swords, which caused them to bowl lamenta'
bly, to the terror of their fellow-devourers, who
resigned to us the field as victorious conquerors.
And indeed, I question whether Alexander, king

of Macedon, in any of his conquests, had more
occasion for triumph than we had; for he was

but attacked by numerous armies of soldiers,
whereas our little army was obliged to combat a
legion of devils, as it were, worse than canni-
bals, who, had they slain us, would have sacri-

ficed us the same moment, to satisfy their vora-
cious appetites. '

Thus ended our bloody battle with the beasts,
having killed three score of them, and saved our
lives from their fury. We had still a league to
go farther, when, as we went, our ears were
saluted with their most unwelcome howlings, ex-
pecting every moment another attack. But in a
hour's time we arrived safe at the town where we'
were to lodge; and here we found the place
strictly guarded, and all in terrible confusion;
as well they might, for fear of the bears and
wolves breaking into the village, in order to prey
upon their cattle and people. The next morning
we were obliged to take a new guide, the other
being very ill of the wounds which he had re-
ceived, as before mentioned. After we had
reached Thoulouse, we came into a warm, plea-
sant, and fruitful country, not infested with
wolves, nor any sort of ravenous creatures; and
when we told our story there, they blamed our
guide much, for conducting us through the forest
at the foot of the mountains, and in such a se-
vere season too, when the snow obliged them to
seek for shelter in the woods.

I think I have nothing uncommon in my pas-
sage through France to take notice of, since other
travellers of greater learning and ingenuity have
given a more ample account than my pen is able
to ' set forth. From Thoulouse I travelled to
Paris, from thence to Calais, where I took ship'
ping, and landed at Dover the'l4th of January,

in a cold season.
' 'hus come to the end of my travels, I soon
discovered my new found estate, and all the bills
of exchange I had brought were currently paid.
The good ancient widow, my only privy coun-

seller, thought no pains or care too great to pro-
cure my advantage; nor had I ever occasion to
blame her fidelity, which drew from me an ample
reward. I was for leaving my effects in her
hands, intending to set out for Lisbon, and so
to the Brasils; but as in the desolate island I

had some doubts about the Romish religion, so
Iknew there was but little encouragement to

settle there, unless I would apostatise from the
orthodox faith, or live in continual fear of the

Inquisition. Upon this account I resoved to sell
my plantation: and for that intent I wrote to my
old friend at Lisbon, who returned me an answer

to my great satisfaction; which was, that he
could readily sell it there: however, if I thought
it convenient to give him liberty to offer it in my
name to the two merchants, the survivors of my
trustees, residing at the Brasils, who, conse-
quently understood its intrinsic value, having
livedjust upon the spot, and who, [was sensible,
were very rich, and therefore might be the more
willing to purchase it; he did not in the least
doubt but I should make 4000 or 5000 pieces of
eight more of it, than I should do if I disposed
of it in any other manner whatsoever.

You may be sure I could not but agree with
this kind and ingenuous proposal; and immedi-
ately I sent him an order to offer it unto them,
which he according did; so that about eight
months after, the ship being in that time returned,
he gave me a satisfactory account, that they not
only willingly accepted the offer, but that they
had also remitted thirty-three thousand pieces of

eight to a correspondent of their own at Lisbon,
in order to pay for the purchase.

Hereupon, in return, I signed the instrument
of sale, according to form, which they had sent
fiom Lisbon, and returned it again to my old

friend, he having sent me, for my estate, bills of
twenty-eight thousand three hundred pieces of
eight, reserving the payment of one hundred
moidores per annum, which I had allowed him
during life, as also fifty to his son during life, ac-
cording to my faithfiil promise, which the planta-
tion was to make good as a rent charge.

Any one would think, that, in this state of
complicated good fortune, I was past running

any more hazards; and so indeed Ihad been,
if other circumstances had not occurred; but I

Q
was inured to a wandering life, had no family,
not many relations, nor, however rich, had I
contracted many acqaintance; and though I
had sold my estate in the Brasils, yet I could not
keep the country out of my head, and had a
great mind to be on the wing again; especially,
I could not resist the strong inclination I had to
see my island, and to know if the poor Spaniards

were in being there, and how the rogues I had
left there had used them.

My true fi-iend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded

me from it, and so far prevailed with me, that
for almost seven years she prevented my running
abroad; during which time I took my two ne-

phews, the children of one of my brothers, into

my care. The eldest, having something of his
own, I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a

settlement of some addition to his estate after

my decease. The other I put out to a captain
of a ship; and, after five years, finding him a
sensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put
him into a good ship, and sent him to sea. In
the meantime, I in part settled myself here.
' For first of all I married, and that not either
to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and had
three children, two 'sons and one daughter: but
my wife dying, and my nephew coming home
with good success from a voyage to Spain, my
inclination to go abroad, and his importunity,
prevailed and engaged me to go in his ship, as
a private trader, to the East Indies. This was
in the year 1694.

In this voyage I visited my new colony in
the island, saw my successors the Spaniards,
had the whole story of their lives, and of the
villains I had left there; how at first they in-

sulted the poor Spaniards; how they afterwards
agreed, disagreed, united, separated; and how
at last the Spaniards were obliged to use violence
with them; how they were subjected to the
Spaniards; how honestly the Spaniards used
them. A history if it were entered into, as
full of variety and wonderful incidents as my

own, particularly as to their repeated battles
with the Carribeans, who landed several times

upon the island; and as to the improvement
they made upon the island itself; and how five
of them made an attempt upon the main-land,
and brought away eleven men and five women

prisoners, by which at my coming I found about
twenty young children in the island. Here I
stayed about twenty days, left them supplies of

J
all necessary things, and particularly of arms,
powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two workmen,
which I brought from England with me, viz. a
carpenter and a smith. Besides this, I shared
the island into parts with them, reserving to my-'
self the property of the whole, but gave them
such parts respectively as they agreed on; and
having settled all things with them, and en-

gaged them not to leave the place, I left them
there.

From thence I touched at the Brasils, from
whence Isent a bark, which I brought there,
with more people to the island. As to the Eng-
lishmen, I promised to send them from England
a good cargo of necessaries, if they would apply
themselves to planting, which I afterwards per-
formed. And the fellows proved very honest
and diligent after they were mastered, and had
their properties set apart for them.

I sent them also from the Brasils five cows,
three of them being with calf, some sheep, and
some hogs, which, when I came again, were
considerably increased. When they had all
these things, three hundred Carribees came and
invaded them, and ruined their plantations.

They fought with that number twice, and were
Y
at first defeated, and three of them killed; but
at last a storm destroying their enemies' canoes,
they famished or destroyed almost all the rest;
and renewed and recovered the possession of their
plantation, and still lived upon the island.

THE END.
