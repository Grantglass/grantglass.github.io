I am monarch of all I survey, 

My right there is none to dispute, 

From the centre all round to the sea, 

I am lord of the fowl and the brute. 

0 Solitude! where are the charms 
That sages have seen in your face? 

Better dwell in the midst of alarms, 

Than reign in this horrible place. 

* * * * * 

But the sea-fowl is gone to her nest, 

The beast is laid down in his lair, 

Even here is a season of rest, 

And I to my cabin repair. 

There’s mercy in every place, 

And mercy, encouraging thought! 

Gives every affliction a grace, 

And reconciles man to his lot. 

William Cowpbu. 




CHAPTER I 

EARLY LIFE 

I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of 
a good family, though not of that country, my father 
being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull. 
He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving 
off his trade, lived afterward at York, from whence he 
had married my mother, whose relations were named 
Robinson, a very good family in that country, and 
from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer ; but by 
the usual corruption of words in England we are now 
called, nay, we call ourselves, and write our name, 
Crusoe, and so my companions always called me. 

Being the third son of The family, and not bred to 
any trade, my head began to be filled very early with 
rambling thoughts. My father, who was very ancient, 
had given me a competent share of learning, as far as 
home-education and a country free school generally 
goes, and designed me for the law ; but I would be satis- 
fied wijh nothing but going to sea; and my inclination 
to this led me so strongly against The will, nay, the 
commands, of my father, and against all the entreaties 
and persuasions of my mother and other friends, that 
there seemed to be something fatal in that propension 
of nature tending directly to the life of misery which 
was to befall me 


7 



8 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious 
and excellent council against what he foresaw was my 
design. He called me one morning into his chamber, 
where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated 
very warmly with me upon this subject. 

He pressed me earnestly, and in the most affec- 
tionate manner, not to play the young man, not to 
precipitate myself into miseries which Nature and the 
station of life I was born in seemed to have provided 
against ; that I was under no necessity of seeking my 
bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour 
to enter me fairly into the middle station of life which 
he had been just recommending to me; and that if 
I was not very easy and happy in the world it must 
be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it, and that 
he should have nothing to answer for, having thus 
discharged his duty in warning me against measures 
which he knew would be to my hurt ; in a word, that 
as he would do very kind things for me if I would 
stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would 
not have so much hand in piy misfortunes, as to give 
me any encouragement to go away. And to close all, 
he told me I had my elder brother for an example, to 
whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to 
keep from going into the Low Country wars, but could 
not prevail, his young desires prompting* him to run 
into the army, where he was killed; and though he 
said he would not cease to pray for me, yet he would 
venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish 
step, God would not bless me, and I would have 
leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his 
counsel when there might be none to alsist in my 
recovery. 

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as 



EARLY LIFE 9 

indeed who could be otherwise? and I resolved not 
to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at 
home according to my father’s desire. But alas! a 
few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent 
any of my father’s farther importunities, in a few 
weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him. 
However, I did not act so hastily neither as my first 
heat of resolution prompted, but I took my mother, 
at a time when I thought her a little pleasanter than 
ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so en- 
tirely bent upon seeing the world, that I should never 
settle to anything with resolution enough to go through 
with it, and my father had better give me his consent 
than force me to go without it; that I was now 
eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice 
to a trade, or clerk to an attorney; that I was sure if 
I did, I should never serve out my time, and I should 
certainly run away from my master before my time 
was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to 
my father to let me go but one voyage abroad, if I 
came home again and did not like it, I would go no 
more, and I would promise by a double diligence to 
recover that time I had lost. 

This put my mother into a great passion. She told 
me, she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to 
my father upon any such subject; that he knew too 
well what was my interest to give his consent to any- 
thing so much for my hurt, and that she wondered 
how I fcould think of any such thing after such a dis- 
course aS I had had with my father, and such kind 
and tender expressions as she knew my father had 
used to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself 
there was ^o help for me; that I might depend I 
should never have their consent to it;, that for her 



10 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

part, she would not have so much hand in my 
destruction, and I should never have it to say, that 
my mother was willing when my father was not. 

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, 
yet, as I have heard afterwards, she reported all the 
discourse to him, and that my father, after showing 
a great concern at it, said to her with a sigh, “ That 
boy might be happy if he would stay at home, but 
if he goes abroad he will be the miserablest wretch 
that was ever born: I can give no consent to it.” 

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke 
loose, though in the meantime I continued obstinately 
deaf to all proposals of settling to business, and fre- 
quently expostulating with my father and mother 
about their being so positively determined against 
what they knew my inclinations prompted me to. 
But being one day at Hull, where I went casually, 
and without any purpose of making an elopement 
that time; but I say, being there, and one of my 
companions being going by sea to London, in his 
father’s ship, and prompting me to go with them, 
with the common allurement of seafaring men, viz., 
that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I con- 
sulted neither father or mother any more, nor so much 
as sent them word of it ; but leaving them to hear of 
it as they might, without asking God’s blessing, or my 
father's, without any consideration of circumstances 
or consequences, and in an ill hour, God knows, on 
the first of September, 1651, I went on board 1 a ship 
bound for London. Never any young adventurer’s 
misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued 
longer than mine. 



THE SHIPWRECK 


ii 


CHAPTER II 
THE SHIPWRECK 

After many varied adventures at sea , including two 
voyages to Guinea , Robinson settled down for four years 
as a planter in the Brazils , using San Salvador as his 
port. He prospered exceedingly , and made many friends 
among the planters and merchants , and often spoke to 
them about his trading on the coast of Guinea. 

It happened, being in company with some merchants 
and planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those 
things very earnestly, three of them came to me the 
next morning, and told me that they came to make 
a secret proposal to me. And after enjoining me 
secrecy, they told me that they had a mind to fit out 
a ship to go to Guinea; that they had all plantations 
as well as I, and were straitened for nothing so much 
as servants; that as it was a trade that could not be 
carried on because they could not publicly sell the 
negroes when they came? home, so they desired to 
make but one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore 
privately, and divide them among their own planta- 
tions; and, in a word, the question was, whether I 
would go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the 
trading paft upon the coast of Guinea; and they 
offered me -that I should have my equal share of the 
negroefe .without providing any part of the stock. 

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had 
it been made to any one that had not had a settlement 
and plantation of his own to look after, which was in 
a fair way of coming to be very considerable, and with 
a good stock upon it. But for me, that was thus entered 



12 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

and established, and had nothing to do but go on as I 
had begun, for three or four years more, and to have 
sent for the other hundred pounds from England; and 
who, in that time, and with that little addition, could 
scarce have failed of being worth three or four thousand 
pounds sterling, and that increasing too — for me to 
think of such a voyage, was the most preposterous 
thing that ever man, in such circumstances, could be 
guilty of. 

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could 
no more resist the offer than I could restrain my first 
rambling designs, when my father’s good counsel was 
lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would go with 
all my heart, if they would undertake to look after 
my plantation in my absence, and would dispose of it 
to such as I should direct if I miscarried. This they all 
engaged to do, and entered into writings or covenants 
to do so; and I made a formal will, disposing of my 
plantation and effects, in case of my death; making 
the captain of the ship that had saved my life, as 
before, my universal heir, but obliging him to dispose 
of my effects as I had directed in my will; one half 
of the produce being to himself, and the other to be 
shipped to England. 

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my 
effects, and keep up my plantation. Had I used half 
as much prudence to have looked into my own interest, 
and have made a judgment of what I ought to have 
done and not to have done, I had certainty never 
gone away from so prosperous an undertaking, leaving 
all the probable views of a thriving circumstance, and 
gone upon a voyage to sea, attended vtith all its 
common hazards, to say nothing of the reasons I had 
to expect particular misfortunes to myself. 



THE SHIPWRECK 13 

But I was hurried on* and obeyed blindly the 
dictates of my fancy rather than my reason. And 
accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the cargo 
furnished, and all things done as by agreement by my 
partners in the voyage, I went on board in an evil 
hour, the [first] of [September 1659], being the same 
day eight year that I went from my father and mother 
at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, 
and the fool to my own interest. 

Our ship was about 120 tons burthen, carried six 
guns and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, 
and myself. We had on board no large cargo of goods, 
except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the 
negroes — such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd 
trifles, especially little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, 
hatchets, and the like. 

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing 
away to the northward upon our own coast, with 
design to stretch over for the African coast, when 
they came about ten or twelve degrees of northern 
latitude, which, it seems, was the manner of their 
course in those days. We passed the line in about 
twelve days' time, and were, by our last observation, 
in seven degrees twenty-two minutes northern lati- 
tude, when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us 
quite out of # our knowledge. It began from the south- 
east, came about to the north-west, and then settled 
into the north-east, from whence it blew in such a 
terrible manner, that for twelve days together we could 
do nothing but drive, and, scudding away before it, 
let it carry us wherever fate and the fury of the winds 
directed; and during these twelve days, I need not 
say that I expected every day to be swallowed up, nor, 
indeed, did any in the ship expect to save their lives. 



14 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

In this distress we had, besides the terror of the 
storm, one of our men died of the calenture, and one 
man and the boy washed overboard. About the twelfth 
day, the weather abating a littje, the master made an 
observation as well as he could, and found that he 
was gotten upon the coast of Guiana, or the north 
part of Brazil, beyond the river Amazon, toward that 
of the river Orinoco, commonly called the Great River, 
and began to consult with me what course we should 
take, for the ship was leaky and very much disabled, 
and he was going directly back to the coast of Brazil. 

I was positively against that ; and looking over the 
charts of the sea-coast of America with him, we con- 
cluded there was no inhabited country for us to have 
recourse to till we came within the circle of the Caribbee 
Islands, and therefore resolved to stand away for the 
Barbadoes, which by keeping off at sea, to avoid the 
indraft of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico, we might easily 
perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days* sail; 
whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to 
the coast of Africa without some assistance, both to 
our ship and to ourselves. 

With this design we changed our course, and steered 
away N.W. by W. in order to reach some of our 
English islands, where I hoped for relief; but our 
voyage was otherwise determined; for a second storm 
came upon us, which carried us away with the same 
impetuosity westward, and drove us so out r of the 
very way of all human commerce, that had all our 
lives been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in 
danger of being devoured by savages than ever re- 
turning to our own country. » 

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one 
of our men early in the morning cried out, " Land! " 



THE SHIPWRECK 15 

and we had no sooner ran out of the cabin to look 
out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we 
were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and in a 
moment, her motion being so stopped, the sea broke 
over her in such a manner, that we expected we 
should all have perished immediately; and we were 
immediately driven into our close quarters, to shelter 
us from the very foam and spray of the sea. 

It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the 
like condition, to describe or conceive the consterna- 
tion of men in such circumstances. We knew nothing 
where we were, or upon what land it was we were 
driven, whether an island or the main, whether in- 
habited or not inhabited; and as the rage of the wind 
was still great, though rather less than at first, we 
could not so much as hope to have the ship hold 
many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the 
winds, by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately 
about. In a word, we sat looking one upon another, 
and expecting death every moment, and every man 
acting accordingly, as preparing for another world; 
for there was little or nothing more for us to do in this. 
That which was our present comfort, and all the 
comfort we had, was that, contrary to our expecta- 
tion, the ship did not break yet, and that the master 
said the wind began to abate. 

Now, though we thought that the wind did a little 
abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, 
and sticking too fast for us to expect her getting off, 
we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had 
nothing to do but to think of saving our lives as well 
as we could. We had a boat at our stem just before 
the storm, but she was first staved by dashing against 
the ship's rudder, and in the next place, she broke 



16 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

away, and either sunk, or was driven off to sea, so 
there was no hope from her; we had another boat 
on board, but how to get her off into the sea was a 
doubtful thing. However, there was no room to debate, 
for we fancied the ship would break in pieces every 
minute, and some told us she was actually broken 
already. 

In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold 
of the boat, and with the help of the rest of the men 
they got her slung over the ship's side; and getting 
all into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being 
eleven in number, to God's mercy, and the wild sea; 
for though the storm was abated considerably, yet the 
sea went dreadful high upon the shore. 

And now our case was very dismal indeed, for we 
all saw plainly that the sea went so high, that the 
boat could not live, and that we should be inevitably 
drowned. However, we committed our souls to God 
in the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us 
towards the shore, we hastened our destruction with 
our own hands, pulling as^well as we could towards 
land. 

What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether 
steep or shoal, we knew not ; the only hope that could 
rationally give us the least shadow of expectation was, 
if we might happen into some bay or 'gulf, or the 
mouth of some river, where by great chance we might 
have run our boat in, or got under the lee of the land, 
and perhaps made smooth water. But there was 
nothing of this appeared ; but as we made nearer and 
nearer the shore, the land looked more fruitful than 
the sea. 

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a 
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, 



THE SHIPWRECK 17 

mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and plainly 
bade us expect the coup de grdce. In a word, it took 
us with such a fury, that it overset the boat at once ; 
and separating us, as well from the boat as from one 
another, gave us not time hardly to say, " 0 God ! 99 
for we were all swallowed up in a moment. 

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which 
I felt when I sunk into the water; for though I swam 
very well, yet I could not deliver myself from the 
waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having 
driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on towards 
the shore, and having spent itself, went back, and 
left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead with 
the water I took in. I had so much presence of mind, 
as well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the 
mainland than I expected, I got upon my feet, and 
endeavoured to make on towards the land as fast as 
I could, before another wave should return and take 
me up again. But I soon found it was impossible to 
avoid it ; for I saw the sea come after me as high as 
a great hill, and as furious as an enemy, which I had 
no means or strength to contend with. My business 
was to hold my breath, and raise myself upon the 
water, if I could; and so by swimming, to preserve 
my breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore, if 
possible; my greatest concern now being that the 
sea, as it would carry me a great way towards the 
shore •when it came on, might not carry me back 
again with it when it gave back towards the sea. 

The wave that came upon me again, buried me at 
once twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body, and 
I could fell myself carried with a mighty force and 
swiftness towards the shore a very great way; but 
I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still 



18 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

forward with all my might. I was ready to burst 
with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising 
up, so, to my immediate relief, I found my head and 
hands shoot out above the surface of the water; and 
though it was not two seconds of time that I could 
keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me 
breath and new courage. I was covered again with 
water a good while, but not so long but I held it out; 
and finding the water had spent itself, and began to 
return, I struck forward against the return of the 
waves, and felt ground again with my feet. I stood 
still a few moments to recover breath, and till the 
water went from me, and then took to my heels and 
ran with what strength I had farther towards the 
shore. But neither would this deliver me from the 
fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me again, 
and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and 
carried forwards as before, the shore being very flat. 

The last time of these two had well near been fatal 
to me ; for the sea, having hurried me along as before, 
landed me, or rather dashed me, against a piece of a 
rock, and that with such force, as it left me senseless, 
and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for 
the blow taking my side and breast, beat the breath 
as it were quite of my body; and had it returned 
again immediately, I must have been strangled in the 
water. But I recovered a little before the return of 
the waves, and seeing I should be covered again with 
the water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the 
rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till the wave 
went back. Now as the waves were not so high as at 
first, being near land, I held my hold till* the wave 
abated, and then fetched another run, which brought 
me so near the shore, that the next ^ave, though it 



THE SHIPWRECK 19 

went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry 
me away, and the next run I took I got to the main- 
land, where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the 
cliffs of the shore, and, sat me down upon the grass, 
free from danger, and quite out of the reach of the 
water. 

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to 
look up and thank God that my life was saved in a 
case wherein there was some minutes before scarce 
any room to hope. 

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, 
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in the 
contemplation of my deliverance making a thousand 
gestures and motions which I cannot describe, reflecting 
upon all my comrades that were drowned, and that 
there should not be one soul saved but myself; for, 
as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any sign 
of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two 
shoes that were not fellows. 

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the 
breach and froth of the.sea being so big, I could 
hardly see it, it lay so far off, and considered, Lord! 
how was it possible I could get on shore? 

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable 
part of my condition, I began to look round me to see 
what kind of place I was in, and what was next to be 
done, and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, 
in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance; for 1 was wet, 
had no Clothes to shift me, nor anything either to eat 
or drink to comfort me, neither did I see any prospect 
before me but that of perishing with hunger, or being 
devoured by wild beasts; and that which was par- 
ticularly afflicting to me was, that I Ijad no. weapon 
either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance. 



20 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

or to defend myself against any other creature that 
might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I had 
nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a 
little tobacco in a box. This was all my provision; 
and this threw me into terrible agonies of mind, that 
for a while I ran about like a madman. Night coming 
upon me, I began, with a heavy heart, to consider 
what would be my lot if there were any ravenous 
beasts in that country, seeing at night they always 
come abroad for their prey. 

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that 
time was, to get up into a thick bushy tree like a 
fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and where I 
resolved to sit all night, and consider the next day 
what death I should die, for as yet I saw no prospect 
of life. I walked about a furlong from the shore, to 
see if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I 
did, to my great joy; and having drank, and put a 
little tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went 
to the tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured to 
place myself so, as that if I should sleep I might not 
fall ; and having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, 
for my defence, I took up my lodging, and having 
been excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept 
as comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in 
my condition, and found myself the mogt refreshed 
with it that I think I ever was on such an occasion. 

When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, 
and the storm abated, so that the sea did hot rage 
and swell as before. But that which surprised me most 
was, that the ship was lifted off in the night from the 
sand where she lay, by the swelling of the tide, and 
was driven up almost as far as the rock which I first 
mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the dashing 



21 


THE SHIPWRECK 

me against it. This being within abopt a mile from the 
shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand 
upright still, I wished n^self on board, that, at least, 
I might have some necessary things for my use. 

When I came down Irom my apartment in the tree 
I looked about me again, and the first thing I found 
was the boat which lay as the wind and the sea had 
tossed her up upon the land, about two miles on my 
right hand. I walked as far as I could upon the shore 
to have got to her, but found a neck or inlet of water 
between me and the boat, which was about half a 
mile broad; so I came back for the present, being 
more intent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped 
to find something for my present subsistence. 

A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and 
the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come within 
a quarter of a mile of the ship; and here I found a 
fresh renewing of my grief, for I saw evidently, that 
if we had kept on board we had been all safe, that is 
to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not 
been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of 
all comfort and company,' as I now was. This forced 
tears from my eyes again; but as there was little 
relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship; 
so I pulled off my clothes, for the weather was hot to 
extremity, and took the water. But when I came to 
the ship, my difficulty was still greater to know how 
to get.on board; for as she lay aground, and high 
out of the water, there was nothing within my reach 
to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and the second 
time I spied a small piece of a rope, which I wondered 
I did not see at first, hang down by the fore-chains 
so low, as that with great difficulty I got hold of it, 
and by the help of that rope got up into the fore- 



22 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

castle of the ship. Here I found that the ship was 
bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold, 
but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, 
or rather earth, that her stern lay lifted up upon the 
bank, and her head low almost to the water. By this 
means all her quarter was free, and ail that was in 
that part was dry ; for you may be sure my first work 
was to search and to see what was spoiled and what 
was free. And first I found that all the ship’s provisions 
were dry and untouched by the water; and being very 
well disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room and 
filled my pockets with biscuit, and eat it as I went 
about other things, for I had no time to lose. I also 
found some rum in the great cabin, of which I took 
a large dram, and which I had indeed need enough of 
to spirit me for what was before me. Now I wanted 
nothing but a boat, to furnish myself with many 
things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me. 

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not 
to be had, and this extremity roused my application. 
We had several spare yards, and two or three large 
spars of wood, and a spare top-mast or two in the 
ship. I resolved to fall to work with these, and flung 
as many of them overboard as I could manage for 
their weight, tying every one with a rope, that they 
might not drive away. When this was done I went 
down the ship’s side, and, pulling them to me, I tied 
four of them fast together at both ends as wpll as I 
could, in the form of a raft ; and laying twa or three 
short pieces of plank upon them crossways, 1 found 
I could walk upon it very well, but that it was not 
able to bear any great weight, the pieces being too 
light. So I went to work, and with the carpenter’s 
saw I cut a spare . top-mast into three lengths, and 



THE SHIPWRECK 23 

added them to my raft, with a great deal of labour 
and pains; but hope of furnishing myself with neces- 
saries encouraged me to go beyond what I should have 
been able to have done upon another occasion. 

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reason- 
able weight. My next care was what to load it with, 
and how to preserve what I laid upon it from the surf 
of tlie sea; but I was not long considering this. I 
first laid all the planks or boards upon it that I could 
get, and having considered well what I most wanted, 
I first got three of the seamen’s chests, which I had 
broken open, and emptied, and lowered them down 
upon my raft. The first of these I filled with provisions, 
viz., bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of 
dried goat’s flesh, which we lived much upon, and a 
little remainder of European com, which had been 
laid by for some fowls which we brought to sea with 
us, but the fowls were killed. There had been some 
barley and wheat together, but, to my great dis- 
appointment, I found afterwards that the rats had 
eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found several 
cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which 
were some cordial waters, and, in all, about five or 
six gallons of rack. These I stowed by themselves, 
there being no need to put them into the chest, nor 
no room for them. While I was doing this, I found 
the tide began to flow, though very calm, and I had 
the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, 
which T^had left on shore upon the sand, swim away; 
as for my breeches, which were only linen, and open- 
kneed, I swam on board in them, and my stockings. 
However, this put me upon rummaging for clothes, 
of which 1 found enough, but took no more than 
I wanted for present use ; for I had other things 



24 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

which my eye was more upon, as first tools to work 
with on shore; and it was after long searching that 
I found out the carpenter's chest, which was indeed 
a very useful prize to me, and much more valuable 
than a shiploading of gold would have been at that 
time. I got it down to my raft, even whole as it was, 
without losing time to look into it, for I knew in 
general what it contained. 

My next care was for some ammunition and arms; 
there were two very good fowling-pieces in the great 
cabin, and two pistols; these I secured first, with some 
powder-horns, and a small bag of shot, and two old 
rusty swords. I knew there were three barrels of 
powder in the ship, but knew not where our gunner 
had stowed them; but with much search I found 
them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken 
water; those two I got to my raft with the arms. 
And now I thought myself pretty well freighted, and 
began to think how I should get to shore with them, 
having neither sail, oar or rudder; and the least 
capful of wind would have overset all my navigation. 

I had three encouragements, i. A smooth calm sea. 
2. The tide rising and setting in to the shore. 3. What 
little wind there was blew me towards the land. And 
thus, having found two or three broken oars belonging 
to the boat, and besides the tools which were in the 
chest, I found two saws, an axe, and a hammer, and 
with this cargo I put to sea. For a mile or thereabouts 
my raft went very well, only that I found it drive a 
little distance from the place where I hai landed 
before, by which I perceived that there was some 
indraft of the water, and consequently I hoped to 
find some creek or river there, which I might make 
use of as a port to get to land with my cargo. 



THE SHIPWRECK 25 

As I imagined, so it was; there appeared before 
me a little opening of the land, and I found a strong 
current of the tide set into it, so I guided my raft as 
well as I could to keep in the middle of the stream. 
But here I had like to have suffered a second ship- 
wreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have 
broke my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast, 
my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal, 
and not being aground at the other end, it wanted 
but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards 
that end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water. 
I did my utmost by setting my back against the 
chests to keep them in their places, but could not 
thrust off the raft with all my strength, neither durst 
I stir from the posture I was in, but holding up the 
chests with all my might, stood in that manner near 
half-an-hour, in which time the rising of the water 
brought me a little more upon a level; and a little 
after, the water still rising, my raft floated again, and 
I thrust her off with the oar I had into the channel, 
and then driving up higher, I at length found myself 
in the mouth of a little riVer, with land on both sides, 
and a strong current or tide running up. I looked on 
both sides for a proper place to get to shore, for I was 
not willing to be driven too high up the river, hoping 
in time to see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved 
to place myself as near the coast as I could. 

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of 
the creek, to which, with great pain and difficulty, 
I guided my raft, and at last got so near, as that, 
reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her 
directly in; but here I had like to have dipped all 
my cargo in the sea again; for that shore lying pretty 
Steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no place to 



26 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

land but where one end of my float, if it run on shore, 
would lie so high and the other sink lower, as before, 
that it would endanger my cargo again. All that I 
could do was to wait till the tide was at the highest, 
keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor to hold 
the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of 
ground, which I expected the water would flow over; 
and so it did. As soon as I found water enough, for 
my raft drew about a foot of water, I thrust her on 
upon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened 
or moored her by sticking my two broken oars into 
the ground; one on one side near one end, and one 
on the other side near the other end; and thus I lay 
till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all 
my cargo safe on shore. 


CHAPTER III 

CRUSOE'S ISLAND 

My next work was to view the country and seek a 
proper place for my habitation, and where to stow 
my goods to secure them from whatever might happen. 
Where I was, I yet knew not ; whether on the conti- 
nent, or on an island; whether inhabited or not in- 
habited; whether in danger of wild beasts, or not. 
There was a hill, not above a mile from me, which 
rose up very steep and high, and which seeiped to 
overtop some other hills, which lay as in a ridge from 
it, northward. I took out one of the fowling-pieces 
and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder; and 
thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the top 
of that hill, where, after I had with great labour and 
difficulty got to the top, I saw my fate to my great 



CRUSOE'S ISLAND 27 

affliction, viz., that I was in an island environed every 
way with the sea, no land to be seen, except some 
rocks which lay a great way off, and two small islands 
less than this, which lay about three leagues to the 
west. 

I found also that the island I was in was barren, 
and, as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, 
except by wild beasts, of whom, however, I saw none; 
yet I saw an abundance of fowls, but knew not their 
kinds; neither, when I killed them, could I tell what 
was fit for food, and what not. At my coming back, 
I shot at a great bird which I saw sitting upon a teee 
on the side of a great wood. I believe it was the first 
gun that had been fired there since the creation of 
the world. I had no sooner fired, but from all the 
parts of the wood there arose an innumerable number 
of fowls of many sorts, making a confused screaming, 
and crying everyone according to his usual note; but 
not one of them of any kind that I knew. As for the 
creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of a hawk, its 
colour and beak resembling it, but had no talons or 
claws more than common; its flesh was carrion, and 
fit for nothing. 

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my 
raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, 
which took me up the rest of that day; and what 
to do with myself at night I knew hot, nor indeed 
where to rest; for I was afraid to lie down on the 
ground, not knowing but some wild beast might devour 
me, though, as I afterwards found, there was really 
no need for those fears. However, as well as I could 
I barricaded myself round with the chests and boards 
that I had brought on shore, and made a kind of a 
hut for that night's lodging; as for food, I yet saw 



28 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

not which way to supply myself, except that I had 
seen two or three creatures like hares run out of the 
wood where I shot the fowl. 

I now began to consider, that I might yet get a 
great many things out of the ship, which would be 
useful to me, and particularly some of the rigging and 
sails, and such other things as might come to land; 
and I resolved to make another voyage on board the 
vessel, if possible. And as I knew that the first storm 
that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, 
I resolved to set all other things apart till I got every- 
thing out of the ship that I could get. Then I called 
a council, that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I 
should take back the raft, but this appeared imprac- 
ticable; so I resolved to go as before, when the tide 
was down; and I did so, only that I stripped before 
I went from my hut, having nothing on but a chequered 
shirt and a pair of linen drawers, and a pair of pumps 
on my feet. 

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a 
second raft, and having had experience of the first, 
I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so 
hard; but yet I brought away several things very 
useful to me; as, first, in the carpenter's stores I 
found two or three bags of nails and spikes, a great 
screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and above all, 
that most useful thing called a grindstone. All these 
I secured, together with several things belonging to 
the gunner, particularly two or three iron crows, and 
two barrels of musket bullets, seven muskets, and 
another fowling-piece, with some small quantity of 
powder more; a large bag full of small-shot, and a 
great roll of sheet lead; but this last was so heavy, 
I could not hoist it up to get it over the ship's side. 



CRUSOE'S ISLAND 29 

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that 
I could find, and a spare fore-top sail, a hammock, 
and some bedding ; and with this I loaded my second 
raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to my very 
great comfort. 

I was under some apprehension during my absence 
from the land, that at least my provisions might be 
devoured on shore; but when I came back, I found 
no sign of any visitor, only there sat a creature like 
a wild cat upon one of the chests, which, when I came 
towards it, ran away a little distance, and then stood 
still. She sat very composed and unconcerned, and 
looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to be 
acquainted with me. I presented my gun at her; but 
as she did not understand it, she was perfectly un- 
concerned at it, nor did she offer to stir away; upon 
which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though, by the 
way, I was not very free of it, for my store was not 
great. However, I spared her a bit, I say, and she 
went to it, smelled of it, and ate it, and looked (as 
pleased) for more ; but I thanked her, and could spare 
no more, so she marched bff. 

Having got my second cargo on shore, though I 
was fain to open the barrels of powder and bring them 
by parcels, for they were too heavy, being large casks, 
I went to work to make me a little tent with the sail 
and some poles which I cut for that purpose: and into 
this tent I brought everything that I knew would spoil 
either with rain or sun; and I piled all the empty 
chests and casks up in a circle round the tent, to 
fortify it from any sudden attempt, either from man 
or beast. • 

When I had done this I blocked up the door of 
the tent with some boards within, and an empty 



30 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

chest set up on end without; and spreading one of 
the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just 
at my head, and my gun at length by me, I went to 
bed for the first time, and slept very quietly all night, 
for I was very weary and heavy ; for the night before 
I had slept little, and had laboured very hard all day, 
as well to fetch all those things from the ship, as to 
get them on shore. 

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that 
ever was laid up, I believe, for one man; but I was 
not satisfied still, for while the ship sat upright in 
that posture, I thought I ought to get everything out 
of her that I could. So every day at low water I went 
on board, and brought away something or other; but, 
particularly, the third time I went 1 brought away 
as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small 
ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare 
canvas, which was to mend the sails upon occasion, 
the barrel of wet gunpowder; in a word, I brought 
away all the sails first and last, only that I was fain 
to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time 
as I could; for they were ho more useful to be sails, 
but as mere canvas only. 

But that which comforted me more still was, that 
at last of all, after I had made five or six such voyages 
as these, and thought I had nothing more to expect 
from the ship that was worth my meddling with; I 
say, after all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, 
and three large runlets of rum or spirits, and a box 
of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour; this was surprising 
to me, because I had given over expecting any more 
provisions, except what was spoilt by the water. I 
soon emptied the hogshead of that bread, and wrapped 
it up parcel by parcel in pieces of the sails, which I 



CRUSOE'S ISLAND 31 

cut out; and, in a word, I got all this safe on shore 
also. 

The next day I made another voyage. And now, 
having plundered the ship of what was portable and 
fit to hand out, I began with the cables; and cutting 
the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I 
got two cables and a hawser on shore, with all the 
iron-work I could get ; and having cut down the sprit- 
sailyard, and the mizzen-yard, and everything I could 
to make a large raft, I loaded it with ail those heavy 
goods, and came away. But my good luck began now 
to leave me; for this raft was so unwieldy, and so 
overladen, that after I was entered the little cove 
where I had landed the rest of my goods, not being 
able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it over- 
set, and threw me and all my cargo into the water. 
As for myself, it was no great harm, for I was near 
the shore; but as to my cargo, it was great part of 
it lost, especially the iron, which I expected would 
have been of great use to me. However, when the tide 
was out I got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and 
some of the iron, though with infinite labour; for 
I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work which 
fatigued me very much. After this I went every day 
on board, and brought away what I could get. 

I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had 
been eleven* times on board the ship; in which time 
I had brought away all that one pair of hands could 
well be supposed capable to bring, though I believe 
verily, had the calm weather held, I should have 
brought away the whole ship piece by piece. But 
preparing Jhe twelfth time to go on board, I found 
the wind begin to rise. However, at low water I went 
on board, and though I thought I had rummaged the 



32 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

cabin so effectually as that nothing more could be 
found, I yet discovered a locker with drawers in it, 
in one of which I found two or three razors, and one 
pair of large scissors, with some ten or a dozen of 
good knives and forks; in another, I found about 
thirty-six pounds value in money, some European 
coin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some gold, 
some silver. 

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. “ O 
drug! ” said I aloud, " what art thou good for? Thou 
art not worth to me, no, not the taking off of the 
ground; one of those knives is worth all this heap 
I have no manner of use for thee; even remain where 
thou art, and go to the bottom as a creature whose 
life is not worth saving.” However, upon second 
thoughts, I took it away; and wrapping all this in 
a piece of canvas, I began to think of making another 
raft ; but while I was preparing this, I found the sky 
overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter 
of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It 
presently occurred to me that it was in vain to pretend 
to make a raft with the wind off shore, and that it was 
my business to be gone before the tide of flood began, 
otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at 
all. Accordingly I let myself down into the water, and 
swam across the channel, which lay between the ship 
and the sands, and even that with difficulty enough, 
partly with the weight of the things I had about me, 
and partly the roughness of the water; for the wind 
rose very hastily, and before it was quite high water 
it blew a storm. 

But I was gotten home to my little tept, where I 
lay with all my wealth about me very secure. It blew 
very hard all that night, and in the morning, when 



CRUSOE'S ISLAND 33 

I looked out, behold, no more ship was to be seen. 
I was a little surprised, but recovered myself with 
this satisfactory reflection, viz., that I had lost no 
time, nor abated no diligence, to get everything out 
of her that could be useful to me, and that indeed 
there was little left in her that I was able to bring 
away if I had had more time. 

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or 
of anything out of her, except what might drive on 
shore from her wreck, as indeed divers pieces of her 
afterwards did ; but those things were of small use to me. 

My thoughts were now wholly employed about 
securing myself against either savages, if any should 
appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island; and 
I had many thoughts of the method how to do this, 
and what kind of dwelling to make, whether I should 
make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon the earth; 
and, in short, I resolved upon both, the manner and 
description of which it may not be improper to give 
an account of. 

I soon found the place I was in was not for my 
settlement, particularly because it was upon a low 
moorish ground near the sea, and I believed would 
not be wholesome; and more particularly because 
there was no fresh water near it. So I resolved to find 
a more healthy and more convenient spot of ground. 

I consulted several things in my situation, which 1 
found would be proper for me. First, health and fresh 
water, I just now mentioned. Secondly, shelter from 
the heat of the sun. Thirdly, security from the ravenous 
creatures, whether men or beasts. Fourthly, a view to 
the sea, that if God sent any ship in sight I might 
not lose any advantage for my deliverance, of which 
I was not willing to banish all my expectation yet. 

B 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


34 

In search of a place proper for this, I found a little 
plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards 
this little plain was steep as a house-side, so that 
nothing could come down upon me from the top; on 
the side of this rock there was a hollow place, worn 
a little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave; 
but there was not really any cave, or way into the 
rock at all. 

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow 
place, I resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not 
above an hundred yards broad, and about twice as 
long, and lay like a green before my door, and at the 
end of it descended irregularly every way down into 
the low grounds by the seaside. It was on the N.N.W. 
side of the hill, so that I was sheltered from the heat 
every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or 
thereabouts, which in those countries is near the 
setting. 

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before 
the hollow place, which took in about ten yards in 
its semi-diameter from the rock, and twenty yards in 
its diameter from its beginning and ending. In this 
half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving 
them into the ground till they stood very firm like 
piles, the biggest end being out of the ground about 
five feet and a half, and sharpened on the top. The 
two rows did- not stand above six inches from one 
another. 

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in 
the ship, and laid them in rows one upon another, 
within the circle, between these two rows of stakes, 
up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside leaning 
against them, about two feet and a half high, like 
a spur to a post; and this fence was so strong, that 



CRUSOE'S ISLAND 35 

neither man or beast could get into it, or over it. 
This cost me a great deal of time and labour, especially 
to cut the piles in the woods, bring them to the place, 
and drive them into the earth. 

The entrance into this place I made to be not by 
a door, but by a short ladder to go over the top; 
which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me, 
and so I was completely fenced in, and fortified, as 
I thought, from all the world, and consequently slept 
secure in the night, which otherwise I could not have 
done; though as it appeared afterward, there was no 
need of all this caution from the enemies that I 
apprehended danger from. 

Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I 
carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition, 
and stores, of which you have the account above; and 
I made me a large tent, which, to preserve me from 
the rains that in one part of the year are very violent 
there, I made double, viz., one smaller tent within, 
and one larger tent above it, and covered the upper- 
most with a large tarpaulin, which I had saved among 
the sails. And now I lay no more for a while in the 
bed which I had brought on shore, but in a hammock, 
which was indeed a very good one, and belonged to 
the mate of the ship. 

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and 
everything that would spoil by the wet; and having 
thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the entrance, 
which, till now, I had left open, and so passed and 
repassed, as I said, by a short ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way 
into the rock; and bringing all the earth and stones 
that I dug down out through my tent, I laid them up 
within my fence in the nature of a terrace, so that it 



36 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

raised the ground within about a foot and a half; 
and thus I made me a cave just behind my tent, which 
served me like a cellar to my house. 

It cost me much labour, and many days, before all 
these things were brought to perfection, and therefore 
I must go back to some other things which took up 
some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened, 
after I had laid my scheme for the setting up my 
tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain falling 
from a thick dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning 
happened, and after that a great clap of thunder, as 
is naturally the effect of it. I was not so much sur- 
prised with the lightning, as I was with a thought 
which darted into my mind as swift as the lightning 
itself. Oh my powder ! My very heart sunk within me 
when I thought, that at one blast all my powder might 
be destroyed, on which, not my defence only, but the 
providing me food, as I thought, entirely depended. 
I was nothing near so anxious about my own danger; 
though had the powder took fire, I had never known 
who had hurt me. 

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the 
storm was over I laid aside all my works, my building, 
and fortifying, and applied myself to make bags and 
boxes to separate the powder, and keep it a little and 
a little in a parcel, in hope that whatever might come 
it might not all take fire at once, and to keep it so 
apart, that it should not be possible to make one part 
fire another. I finished this work in about a fortnight, 
and I think my powder, which in all was about 240 
pounds' weight, was divided in not less than a hundred 
parcels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did 
not apprehend any danger from that, so I placed it 
in my new cave, which in my fancy I called my kitchen, 



CRUSOE'S ISLAND 37 

and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the 
rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very 
carefully where I laid it. 

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went 
out once, at least, every day with my gun, as well 
to divert myself, as to see if I could kill anything fit 
for food, and as near as I could to acquaint myself 
with what the island produced. The first time I went 
out, I presently discovered that there were goats in 
the island, which was a great satisfaction to me; but 
then it was attended with this misfortune to me, viz., 
that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, 
that it was the difiicultest thing in the world to come 
at them. But I was not discouraged at this, not doubt- 
ing but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon 
happened ; for after I had found their haunts a little, 
I laid wait in this manner for them. I observed if 
they saw me in the valleys, though they were upon 
the rocks, they would run away in a terrible fright; 
but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was 
upon the rocks, they took no notice of me, from whence 
I concluded that, by the position of their optics, their 
sight was so directed downward, that they did not 
readily see objects that were above them. So after- 
ward I took this method ; 1 always climbed the rocks 
first to get above them, and then had frequently a 
fair mark. The first shot I made among these creatures 
I killed a she-goat, which had a little kid by her, which 
she gave suck to, which grieved me heartily; but 
when the old one fell, the kid stood stock still by her 
till I came and took her up; and not only so, but 
when 1 canted the old one with me upon my shoulders, 
the kid followed me quite to my enclosure; upon 
which I laid down the dam, and took the kid in my

arms, and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have 
bred it up tame; but it would not eat, so I was forced 
to kill it, and eat it myself. These two supplied me 
with flesh a great while, for I eat sparingly, and saved 
my provisions, my bread especially, as much as possibly 
I could. 


CHAPTER IV 

CRUSOE CONSIDERS 

And now being to enter into a melancholy relation 
of a scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never 
heard of in the world before, I shall take it from its 
beginning, and continue it in its order. It was, by my 
account, the 30th of September when, in the manner 
as above said, I first set foot upon this horrid island, 
when the sun being to us in its autumnal equinox, 
was almost just over my head, for I reckoned myself, 
by observation, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees 
22 minutes north of the line. 

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, 
it came into my thoughts that I should lose my 
reckoning of time for want of books and pen and 
ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days from the 
working days; but to prevent this, I cut it with my 
knife upon a large post, in capital letters; and making 
it into a great cross, I set it up on the shore where 
I first landed, viz., “ I came on shore here on the 30th 
of September 1659.” Upon the sides of this square 
post I cut every day a notch with my knife, and 
every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, 
and every first day of the month as long again as 
that long one; and thus I kept my calendar, of weekly, 
monthly, and yearly reckoning of time. 



CRUSOE CONSIDERS 39 

In the next place we are to observe, that among 
the many things which I brought out of the ship in 
the several voyages, which, as above mentioned, I 
made to it, I got several things of less value, but not 
all less useful to me, which I omitted setting down 
before; as in particular, pens, ink, and paper, several 
parcels in the captain’s, mate’s, gunner’s, and car- 
penter’s keeping, three or four compasses, some mathe- 
matical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, and 
books of navigation, all which I huddled together, 
whether I might want them or no. Also I found 
three very good Bibles, which came to me in my cargo 
from England, and which I had packed up among my 
things; some Portuguese books also, and among them 
two or three Popish prayer-books, and several other 
books, all which I carefully secured. And I must not 
forget, that we had in the ship a dog and two cats, 
of whose eminent history I may have occasion to say 
something in its place; for I carried both the cats 
with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the 
ship of himself, and swam on shore to me the day 
after I went on shore wfth my first cargo, and was 
a trusty servant to me many years. I wanted nothing 
that he could fetch me, nor any company that he 
could make up to me; I only wanted to have him 
talk to me, but that would not do. As I observed 
before, I found pen, ink, and paper, and I husbanded 
them to the utmost ; and I shall show that while my 
ink lasted, I kept things very exact; but after that 
was gone, I could not, for I could not make any ink 
by any means that I could devise. 

And this*put me in mind that I wanted many things, 
notwithstanding all that I had amassed together; and 
of these, this of ink was one, as also spade, pickaxe, 



40 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

and shovel, to dig or remove the earth, needles, pins, 
and thread ; as for linen, I soon learned to want that 
without much difficulty. 

This want of tools made every work I did go on 
heavily; and it was near a whole year before I had 
entirely finished my little pale or surrounded habita- 
tion. The piles or stakes, which were as heavy as I 
could well lift, were a long time in cutting and pre- 
paring in the woods, and more by far in bringing 
home; so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting 
and bringing home one of those posts, and a third 
day in driving it into the ground; for which purpose 
I got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last 
bethought myself of one of the iron crows, which, 
however, though I found it, yet it made driving 
those posts or piles very laborious and tedious 
work. 

But what need I have been concerned at the tedious- 
ness of anything I had to do, seeing I had time enough 
to do it in ? nor had I any other employment, if that 
had been over, at least, that I could foresee, except 
the ranging the island to seek for food, which I did 
more or less every day. 

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and 
the circumstance I was reduced to ; and I drew up the 
state of my affairs in writing; not so much to leave 
them to any that were to come after me, for I was 
like to have but few heirs, as to deliver my thoughts 
from daily poring upon them, and afflicting my mind. 
And as my reason began now to master my despon- 
dency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could, 
and to set the good against the evil, that I might 
have something to distinguish my case from worse; 
and I stated it very impartially, like debtor and creditor, 



CRUSOE CONSIDERS 4* 

the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I suffered, 
thus: 


Evil 

I am cast upon a horrible 
desolate island, void of* all 
hope of recovery. 

I am singled out and sepa- 
rated, as it were, from all the 
world to be miserable. 


I am divided from man- 
kind, a solitaire, one ban- 
ished from human society. 

I have not clothes to 
cover me. 

I am without any defence 
or means to resist any 
violence of man or beast. 


I have no soul to speak to, 
or relieve me. 


Good 

But I am alive, and not 
drowned, as all my ship's 
company was. 

But I am singled out, too, 
from all the ship’s crew to be 
spared from death; and He 
that miraculously saved me 
from death, can deliver me 
from this condition. 

But I am not starved and 
perishing on a barren place, 
affording no sustenance. 

But I am in a hot climate, 
where if I had clothes I 
could hardly wear them. 

But I am cast on an island, 
where I see no wild beasts to 
hurt me, as I saw on the 
coast of Africa; and what if 
I had been shipwrecked 
there? 

But God wonderfully sent 
the ship in near enough to 
the shore, that I have gotten 
out so many necessary things 
as will either supply my 
wants, or enable me to 



Having now brought my mind a little to relish my 
condition, and given over looking out to sea, to see 
if I could spy a ship ; I say, giving over these things, 
I began to apply myself to accommodate my way of 
living, and to make things as easy as I could. 

*B 



42 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

I have already described my habitation, which was 
a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded with a 
strong pale of posts and cables ; but I might now rather 
call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against it 
of turfs, about two feet thick on the outside, and after 
some time — I think it was a year and a half — I raised 
rafters from it leaning to the rock, and thatched or 
covered it with boughs of trees and such things as I 
could get to keep out the rain, which I found at some 
times of the year very violent. 

I have already observed how I brought all my goods 
into this pale, and into the cave which I had made 
behind me. But I must observe, too, that at first 
this was a confused heap of goods, which as they lay 
in no order, so they took up all my place; I had no 
room to turn myself. So I set myself to enlarge my 
cave and works farther into the earth; for it was a 
loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour 
I bestowed on it. And so, when I found I was pretty 
safe as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways to the 
right hand into the rock; and then, turning to the 
right again, worked quite out, and made me a door 
to come out on the outside of my pale or fortification. 
This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were 
a back-way to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave 
me room to stow, my goods. 

And now I began to apply myself to make such 
necessary things as I found I most wanted, as par- 
ticularly a chair and a table; for without these I was 
not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world. 
I could not write or eat, or do several things with 
so much pleasure without a table. 

I had never handled a tool in my life; and yet in 
time, by labour, application, and contrivance, I found 



CRUSOE CONSIDERS 43 

at last that I wanted nothing but I could have made 
it, especially if I had had tools. However, I made 
abundance of things even without tools, and some 
with no more tools than an adze and a hatchet, which 
perhaps were never m*ade that way before, and that 
with infinite labour. For example, if I wanted a 
board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree, 
set it on an edge before me, and hew it flat on either 
side with my axe, till I had brought it to be thin as 
a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It 
is true, by this method I could make but one board 
out of a whole tree; but this I had no remedy for 
but patience, any more that I had for the prodigious 
deal of time and labour which it took me up to make 
a plank or board. But my time or labour was little 
worth, and so it was as well employed one way as 
another. 

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I 
observed above, in the first place, and this I did out 
of the short pieces of boards that I brought on my 
raft from the ship. But when I had wrought out some 
boards, as above, I made* large shelves of the breadth 
of a foot and a half, one over another, all along one 
side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron- 
work; and, in a word, to separate everything at large 
in their places, that I might come easily at them. I 
knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my 
guns and all things that would hang up; so that had 
my cave been to be seen, it looked like a general 
magazine of all necessary things; and I had everything 
so ready at my hand, that it was a great pleasure to 
me to see* all my goods in such order, and especially 
to find my stock of all necessaries so great. 

And now it was when I began to keep a journal of 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


44 

every day's employment; for, indeed, at first, I was 
in too much hurry, and not only as to labour, but in 
too much discomposure of mind; and my journal 
would have been full of many dull things. 

But having gotten over these things in some measure, 
and having settled my household stuff and habitation, 
made me a table and a chair, and all as handsome 
about me as I could, I began to keep my journal, of 
which I shall here give you the copy (though in it 
will be told all these particulars over again) as long 
as it lasted; for, having no more ink, I was forced to 
leave it off. 


CHAPTER V 

EXTRACTS FROM CRUSOE'S JOURNAL 

Nov. 4. — This morning I began to order my times 
of work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep, 
and time of diversion, viz., every morning I walked 
out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not 
rain; then employed myselfr to work till about eleven 
o'clock; then eat what I had to live on; and from 
twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather being 
excessive hot ; and then in the evening to work again. 
The working part of this day and of the next were 
wholly employed in making my table; for I was yet 
but a very sorry workman, though time and necessity 
made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as 
I believe it would do any one else. 

Nov . 5. — This day went abroad with my gun and 
my dog, and killed a wild cat; her skin pretty soft, 
but her flesh good for nothing. Every creature I 
killed, I took off the skins and preserved them. Coming 



EXTRACTS FROM JOURNAL 45 

back by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of sea-fowls, 
which I did not understand; but was surprised, and 
almost frighted, with two or three seals, which, while 
I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were, 
got into the sea, and escaped me for that time. 

Nov. 6. — After my morning walk I went to work 
with my table again, and finished it, though not to 
my liking; nor was it long before I learned to mend it. 

Nov. 7.— Now it began to be settled fair weather. 
The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 
nth was Sunday) I took wholly up to make me a 
chair, and with much ado, brought it to a tolerable 
shape, but never to please me; and even in the mak- 
ing, I pulled it in pieces several times. Note, I soon 
neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting my mark 
for them on my post, I forgot which was which. 

Nov. 17.— This day I began to dig behind my tent 
into the rock, to make room for my farther con- 
veniency. Note, three things I wanted exceedingly 
for this work, viz., a pick-axe, a shovel, and a wheel- 
barrow or basket; so I desisted from my work, and 
began to consider how to Supply that want, and make 
me some tools. As for a pick-axe, I made use of the 
iron crows, which were proper enough, though heavy; 
but the next thing was a shovel or spade. T his was so 
absolutely necessary, that indeed I could do nothing 
effectually without it ; but what kind of one to make, 
I knew not. 

Nov. 18.— The next day, in searching the woods, I 
found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in the 
Brazils they call the iron-tree, for its exceeding hard- 
ness; of this, with great labour, and almost spoiling 
my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home, too, with 
difficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy. 



46 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

The excessive hardness of the wood, and having no 
other way, made me a long while upon this machine, 
for I worked it effectually, by little and little, into 
the form of a shovel or spade, the handle exactly 
shaped like ours in England, only that the broad part 
having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not 
last me so long. 

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a 
wheelbarrow. A basket I could not make by any 
means, having no such things as twigs that would 
bend to make wicker ware, at least none yet found 
out. And as to a wheelbarrow, I fancied I could 
make all but the wheel, but that I had no notion of, 
neither did I know how to go about it; besides, I 
had no possible way to make the iron gudgeons for 
the spindle or axis of the wheel to run in, so I gave 
it over; and so for carrying away the earth which 
I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod 
which the labourers carry mortar in, when they serve 
the bricklayers. 

Nov . 23. — My other work having now stood still 
because of my making these tools, when they were 
finished I went on, and working every day, as my 
strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days 
entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it 
might hold my goods commodiously. 

Note: During all this time I worked to make this 
room or cave spacious enough to accommodate me as 
a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, 
and a cellar; as for my lodging, I kept to the tent, 
except that sometimes in the wet season of the year 
it rained so hard, that I could not keep myself dry, 
which caused me afterwards to cover all my place 
within my pale with long poles, in the form of rafters.

leaning against the rock, and load them with flags 
and large leaves of trees, like a thatch. 

Dec. 10. — I began now to think my cave or vault 
finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had made 
it too large) a great quantity of earth fell down from 
the top and one side, so much, that, in short, it frighted 
me, and not without reason too; for if I had been 
under it, I had never wanted a gravedigger. Upon 
this disaster I had a great deal of work to do over 
again; for I had the loose earth to carry out; and, 
which was of more importance, I had the ceiling to prop 
up, so that I might be sure no more would come down. 

Dec . 11.— This day I went to work with it accord- 
ingly, and got two shores of posts pitched upright to 
the top, with two pieces of boards across over each 
post. This I finished the next day; and setting more 
posts up with boards, in about a week more I had the 
roof secured; and the posts standing in rows, served 
me for partitions to part of my house. 

Dec. 17. — From this day to the twentieth I placed 
shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts to hang 
everything up that could be hung up; and now I 
began to be in some order within doors. 

Dec. 20. — Now I carried everything into the cave, 
and began to furnish m$ house, and set up some 
pieces of boards, like a dresser, to order my victuals 
upon; but boards began to be very scarce with me; 
also I made me another table. 

Dec. 24. — Much rain all night and all day; no 
stirring out. 

Dec. 25. — Rain all day. 

Dec. 26. --No rain, and the earth much cooler than 
before, and pleasanter. 

Dec. 27. — Killed a young goat, and lamed another. 



48 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

so that I catched it, and led it home in a string. 
When I had it home, I bound and splintered up its 
leg, which was broke. N.B . — I took such care of it, 
that it lived, and the leg grew well and as strong as 
ever; but by my nursing it so long it grew tame, and 
fed upon the little green at my door, and would not 
go away. This was the first time that I entertained 
a thought of breeding up some tame creatures, that 1 
might have food when my powder and shot was all spent. 

Dec . 28, 29, 30. — Great heats and no breeze, so that 
there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, 
for food. This time I spent in putting all my things 
in order within doors. 

Jan . 1. — Very hot still, but I went abroad early 
and late with my gun, and lay still in the middle of 
the day. This evening, going farther into the valleys 
which lay towards the centre of the island, I found 
there was plenty of goats, though exceeding shy, and 
hard to come at. However, I resolved to try if I could 
not bring my dog to hunt them down. 

Jan . 2. — Accordingly, the next day, I went out with 
my dog, and set him upon the goats; but I was 
mistaken, for they all faced about upon the dog; 
and he knew his danger too well, for he would not 
come near them. 

Jan . 3. — I began my fence or wall; which, being 
still jealous of my being attacked by somebody. I 
resolved to make very thick and strong. 

N.B .— This wall being described before, I purposely 
omit what was said in the journal. It is sufficient to 
observe that I was no less time than from the 3rd of 
January to the 14th of April working, finishing, and 
perfecting the wall, though it was no more than about 
twenty-four yards in length, being a half circle from 



THE EARTHQUAKE 49 

one place in the rock to another place about eight 
yards from it, the door of the cave being in the centre 
behind it. 


CHAPTER VI 

THE EARTHQUAKE 

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering 
me many days, nay, sometimes weeks together; but I 
thought I should never be perfectly secure till this wall 
was finished. And it was scarce credible what inexpres- 
sible labour everything was done with, especially the 
bringing piles out of the woods, and driving them into 
the ground; for I made them much bigger than I 
need to have done. 

When this wall was finished, and the outside double- 
fenced with a turf-wall raised up close to it, I per- 
suaded myself that if any people were to come on 
shore there, they would not perceive anything like a 
habitation; and it was very well I did so, as may be 
observed hereafter upon a* very remarkable occasion. 

During this time, I made my rounds in the woods 
for game every day, when the rain admitted me, and 
made frequent discoveries in these walks of something 
or other to my advantage; particularly I found a kind 
of wild pigeons, who built, not as wood pigeons in a 
tree, but rather as house pigeons, in the holes of the 
rocks. And taking some young ones, I endeavoured 
to breed them up tame, and did so; but when they 
grew older they flew all away, which, perhaps, was at 
first for want of feeding them, for I had nothing to 
give them. However, I frequently found their nests, 
and got their young ones, which were very good meat. 



50 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

And now in the managing my household affairs I 
found myself wanting in many things, which I thought 
at first it was impossible for me to make, as indeed, 
as to some of them, it was. For instance, I could never 
make a cask to be hooped; *1 had a small runlet or 
two, as I observed before, but I could never arrive to the 
capacity of making one by them, though I spent many 
weeks about it. I could neither put in the heads, or 
joint the staves so true to one another, as to make 
them hold water; so I gave that also over. 

In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle; 
so that as soon as ever it was dark, which was generally 
by seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remem- 
bered the lump of beeswax with which I made candles 
in my African adventure, but I had none of that now. 
The only remedy I had was, that when I had killed 
a goat I saved the tallow, and with a little dish made 
of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added 
a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this 
gave me light, though not a clear steady light like a 
candle. 

In the middle of all my 1 labours it happened, that 
rummaging my things, I found a little bag, which, as 
hinted before, had been filled with corn for the 
feeding of poultry, not for this voyage, but before, 
as I suppose, when the ship came from Lisbon. What 
little remainder of com had been in the bag was all 
devoured with the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag 
hut husks and dust; and being willing to have the 
bag for some other use, I think it was to put powder 
•in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or some 
such use, I shook the husks of corn out of it on one 
side of my fortification, under the rock. It was a 
little before the great rains, just now mentioned, that 



THE EARTHQUAKE 51 

I threw this stuff away, taking no notice of anything, 
and not so much as remembering that I had thrown 
anything there; when, about a month after, or there- 
about, I saw some few stalks of something green 
shooting out of the ground, which I fancied might be 
some plant I had not seen; but I was surprised, and 
perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer time, 
I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were 
perfect breen barley of the same kind as our European, 
nay, as our English barley. 

I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be 
sure, in their season, which was about the end of June; 
and laying up every corn, I resolved to sow them all 
again, hoping in time to have some quantity sufficient 
to supply me with bread. But it was not till the 
fourth year that I could allow myself the least grain 
of this corn to eat, and even then but sparingly, as 
I shall say afterwards in its order; for I lost sdl that 
I sowed the first season, by not observing the proper 
time; for I sowed it just before the dry season, so 
that it never came up at all, at least not as it would 
have done; of which in its ‘place. 

Besides this barley, there was, as above, twenty or 
thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same 
care, and whose use was of the same kind, or to the 
same purpose, viz., to make me bread, or rather food; 
for I found ways to cook it up without baking, though 
I did that also after some time. But to return to my 
journal. 

I worked excessive hard these three or four months 
to get my wall done; and the 14th of April I closed 
it up, contrmng to go into it, not by a door, but over 
the wall by a ladder, that there might be no sign in 
the outside of my habitation. 



52 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

April 16 — I finished the ladder, so I went up with 
the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after me, 
and let it down on the inside This was a complete 
enclosure to me, for within I had room enough, and 
nothmg could come at me from without, unless it 
could first mount my wall 

The very next day after this wall was finished, I 
had almost had all my labour overthrown at once, and 
myself killed The case was thus As I was busy m 
the inside of it, behind my tent, just m the entrance 
mto my cave, I was terribly frighted with a most 
dreadful surprising thing indeed, for all on a sudden 
I found the earth come crumbling down from the 
roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over 
my head, and two of the posts I had set up in the 
cave cracked in a frightful manner I was heartily 
scared, but thought nothmg of what was really the 
cause, only thinking that the top of my cave was 
falling m, as some of it had done before, and for fear 
I should be buried m it, I ran forward to my ladder, 
and not thinking myself safe there neither, I got over 
my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill which I 
expected might roll down upon me I was no sooner 
stepped down upon the firm ground, but I plainly 
saw it was a terrible earthquake, for the ground I 
stood on shook three times at about eight minutes' 
distance, with three such shocks, as would have over- 
turned the strongest building that could be supposed 
to have stood on the earth, and a great piece of the 
top of a rock, which stood about half a mile from me 
next the sea, fell down with such a terrible noise, as 
I never heard m all my life I perceived also the very 
sea was put into violent motion by it , and I believe the 
shocks were stronger under the water than on the island 



THE EARTHQUAKE 53 

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more 
for some time, I began to take courage; and yet I 
had not heart enough to go over my wall again, for 
fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the ground, 
greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what 
to do. All this while I had not the least serious religious 
thought, nothing but the common, “ Lord, have mercy 
upon me! ” and when it was over, that went away too. 

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and 
grow cloudy, as if it would rain. Soon after that the 
wind rose by little and little, so that in less than 
half-an-hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane. The 
sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam and 
froth; the shore was covered with the breach of the 
water; the trees were tom up by the roots; and a 
terrible storm it was: and this held about three hours, 
and then began to abate; and in two hours more it 
was stark calm, and began to rain very hard. 

I was forced to go into my cave, though very much 
afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head. 

This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz., to 
cut a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, 
to let the water go out, which would else have drowned 
my cave. After I had been in my cave some time, 
and found still no more shocks of the earthquake 
follow, I began to be more composed. And now to 
support my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, 
I went to my little store, and took a small sup of rum, 
which however, I did then, and always, very sparingly, 
knowing I could have no more when that was gone. 

It continued raining all that night and great part 
of the next<>day, so that I could not stir abroad; but 
my mind being more composed, I began to think of 
what I had best do, concluding that if the island was 



54 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

subject to these earthquakes, there would be no living 
for me in a cave, but I must consider of building me 
some little hut in an open place, which I might surround 
with a wall, as I had done here, and so make myself 
secure from wild beasts or men; but concluded, if I 
stayed where I was, I should certainly, one time or 
other, be buried alive. 

With these thoughts I resolved to remove my tent 
from the place where it stood, which was just under 
the hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it 
should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my 
tent; and I spent the two next days, being the 19th 
and 20th of April, in contriving where and how to 
remove my habitation. 

The fear of being swallowed up alive made me that 
I never slept in quiet; and yet the apprehension of 
lying abroad without any fence was almost equal to 
it. But still, when I looked about and saw how every- 
thing was put in order, how pleasantly concealed I 
was, and how safe from danger, it made me very loth 
to remove. 

In the meantime it occurred to me that it would 
require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and that 
I must be contented to run the venture where I was, 
till I had formed a camp for myself, and had secured 
it so as to remove to it. So with this resolution I 
composed myself for a time, and resolved that I would 
go to work with all speed to build me a wall with 
piles and cables, &c., in a circle as before, and set 
my tent in it when it was finished, but that I would 
venture to stay where I was till it was finished, and 
fit to remove to. This was the 21st. # 

April 22. — The next morning I began to consider of 
means to put this resolve in execution; but I was at 



THE EARTHQUAKE 55 

a great loss about my tools. I had three large axes, 
and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the hatchets 
for traffic with the Indians), but with much chopping 
and cutting knotty hard wood, they were all full of 
notches and dull; and though I had a grindstone, I 
could not turn it and grind my tools too. This cost 
me as much thought as a statesman would have be- 
stowed upon a grand point of politics, or a judge upon 
the life and death of a man. At length I contrived a 
wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I 
might have both my hands at liberty. Note, I had 
never seen any such thing in England, or at least not 
to take notice how it was done, though since I have 
observed it is very common there; besides that, my 
grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine 
cost me a full week’s work to bring it to perfection. 

April 28, 29. — These two whole days I took up in 
grinding my tools, my machine for turning my grind- 
stone performing very well. 

May 1. — In the morning, looking towards the sea- 
side, the tide being low, I saw something lie on the 
shore bigger than ordinary, and it looked like a cask. 
When I came to it, I found a small barrel, and two or 
three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were 
driven on shore by the late hurricane; and looking 
towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie 
higher out of the water than it used to do. I examined 
the barrel which was driven on shore, and soon found 
it was a barrel of gunpowder; but it had taken water, 
and the powder was caked as hard as a stone. How- 
ever, I rolled it farther on shore for the present, and 
went on upon the sands as near as I could to the wreck 
of the ship to look for more. 

When I came down to the ship I found it strangely 



56 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

removed. The forecastle, which lay before buried in 
sand, was heaved up at least six feet ; and the stern, 
which was broken to pieces, and parted from the rest 
by the force of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging 
her, was tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one side, 
and the sand was thrown so high on that side next 
her stern, that whereas there was a great place of 
water before, so that I could not come within a quarter 
of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I could now 
walk quite up to her when the tide was out. I was 
surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it must 
be done by the earthquake. And as by this violence 
the ship was more broken open than formerly, so many 
things came daily on shore, which the sea had loosened, 
and which the winds and water rolled by degrees to 
the land. 

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design 
of removing my habitation; and I busied myself 
mightily, that day especially, in searching whether I 
could make any way into the ship. But I found nothing 
was to be expected of that kind, for that all the inside 
of the ship was choked up with sand. However, as I 
had learned not to despair of anything, I resolved to 
pull everything to pieces that I could of the ship, 
concluding, that everything I could get from her would 
be of some use or other to me. 

May 3-17. — Went every day to the wreck, and got 
a great deal of pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, 
and two or three hundredweight of iron. 

May 24. — Every day to this day I worked on the 
wreck, and with hard labour I loosened some things 
so much with the crow, that the first blowing tide 
several casks floated out, and two of the seamen's 
chests. But the wind blowing from the shore, nothing 



THE EARTHQUAKE 57 

came to land that day but pieces of timber, and a 
hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it, but the 
salt water and the sand had spoiled it. 

I continued this work every day to the 15th of June, 
except the time necessafy to get food, which I always 
appointed, during this part of my employment, to be 
when the tide was up, that I might be ready when it 
was ebbed out. And by this time I had gotten timber, 
and plank, and ironwork enough to have builded a 
good boat, if I had known how; and also, I got at 
several times, and in several pieces, near one hundred- 
weight of the sheet lead. 

June 16. — Going down to the seaside, I found a 
large tortoise, or turtle. This was the first I had seen, 
which it seems was only my misfortune, not any defect 
of the place, or scarcity; for had I happened to be on 
the other side of the island, I might have had hundreds 
of them every day, as I found afterwards; but, perhaps, 
had paid dear enough for them. 

June 17 I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in 
her three-score eggs; and her flesh was to me, at that 
time, the most savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted 
in my life, having had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, 
since I landed in this horrid place. 

June 18. — Rained all day, and I stayed within. I 
thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I was some- 
thing chilly, which I knew was not usual in that latitude. 

June 19. — Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather 
had been cold. 

June 20. — No rest all night; violent pains in my 
head, and feverish. 

June 21 p — Very ill, frighted almost to death with 
the apprehensions of my sad condition, to be sick, and 
no help. Prayed to God for the first time since the 



58 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

storm off Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or why; 
my thoughts being all confused. 

June 22. — A little better, but under dreadful appre- 
hensions of sickness. 

June 23. — Very bad again; “cold and shivering, and 
then a violent headache. 

June 24. — Much better. 

June 25. — An ague very violent; the fit held me 
seven hours; cold fit, and hot with faint sweats after it. 

June 26. — Better; and having no victuals to eat, 
took my gun, but found myself very weak. However, 
I killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty got it 
home, and broiled some of it, and eat. I would fain 
have stewed it, and made some broth, but had no pot. 

June 27. — The ague again so violent that I lay abed 
all day, and neither eat or drink. I was ready to perish 
for thirst; but so weak, I had not strength to stand 
up, or to get myself any water to drink. Prayed to 
God again, but was light-headed ; and when I was not, 
I was so ignorant that I knew not what so say; only 
I lay and cried, " Lord, look upon me! Lord, pity 
me! Lord, have mercy upon me! ” I suppose I did 
nothing else for two or three hours, till the fit wearing 
off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the night. 
When I waked, I found myself much refreshed, but 
weak, and exceeding thirsty. However, as I had no 
water in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie till 
morning, and went to sleep again. In this second sleep 
I had this terrible dream. 

I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the 
outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew 
after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend 
from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, 
and light upon the ground. He was all over as bright 



THE EARTHQUAKE 59 

as a flame, so that I could but just bear to look 
towards him. His countenance was most inexpressibly 
dreadful, impossible for words to describe. When he 
stepped upon the ground with his feet, I thought the 
earth trembled, just as it had done before in the 
earthquake, and all the air looked, to my apprehension, 
as if it had been filled with flashes of fire. 

He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he 
moved forward towards me, with a long spear or 
weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he came to 
a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me, 
or I heard a voice so terrible, that it is impossible 
to express the terror of it. All that I can say I under- 
stood was this: “Seeing all these things have not 
brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die at 
which words I thought he lifted up the spear that 
was in his hand to kill me. 

No one that shall ever read this account, will expect 
that I should be able to describe the horrors of my 
soul at this terrible vision; I mean, that even while 
it was a dream, I even dreamed of those horrors; nor 
is it any more possible to describe the impression that 
remained upon my mind when I awaked, and found 
it was but a dream. 

I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had 
received by the good instruction of my father was 
then worn out, by an uninterrupted series, for eight 
years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant con- 
versation with nothing but such as were, like myself, 
wicked and profane to the last degree. I do not 
remember that I had, in all that time, one thought 
that so much as tended either to looking upwards toward 
God, or inwards towards a reflection upon my ways. 

It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found 



60 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

all my ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was 
surprised with a kind of ecstasy, and some transports 
of soul, which, had the grace of God assisted, might 
have come up to true thankfulness; but it ended 
where it begun, in a mere common flight of joy, or, 
as I may say, being glad I was alive, without the least 
reflection upon the distinguishing goodness of the hand 
which had preserved me, and had singled me out to 
be preserved, when all the rest were destroyed; or 
an inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful 
to me; even just the same common sort of joy which 
seamen generally have after they are got safe ashore 
from a shipwreck, which they drown all in the next 
bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over, 
and all the rest of my life was like it. 

Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more 
terrible in its nature, or more immediately directing to 
the invisible Power, which alone directs such things, 
yet no sooner was the first fright over, but the im- 
pression it had made went off also. I had no more 
sense of God or His judgments, much less of the 
present affliction of my circumstances being from His 
hand, than if I had been in the most prosperous 
condition of life. 

But now, when I began to be sick, and a leisurely 
view of the miseries of death came to place itself 
before me; when my spirits began to sink under the 
burthen of a strong distemper, and Nature was ex- 
hausted with the violence of the fever; conscience, 
that had slept so long, began to awake, and I began 
to reproach myself with my past life, in which I had 
so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the 
justice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, 
and to deal with me in so vindictive a manner. 



THE EARTHQUAKE 61 

" Now/' said I aloud, “ my dear father's words are 
come to pass; God's justice has overtaken me, and I 
have none to help or hear me. I rejected the voice of 
Providence, which had mercifully put me in a posture 
or station of life wherein I might have been happy 
and easy; but I would neither see it myself, or learn 
to know the blessing of it from my parents. I refused 
their help and assistance, who would have lifted me 
into the world, and would have made everything easy 
to me; and now I have difficulties to struggle with, 
too great for even Nature itself to support, and no 
assistance, no help, no comfort, no advice." Then I 
cried out, “ Lord, be my help, for I am in great 
distress." 

This was the first prayer, if I may call it so, that I 
had made for many years. But I return to my journal. 

June 28. — Having been somewhat refreshed with the 
sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I got 
up; and though the fright and terror of my dream 
was very great, yet I considered that the fit of the 
ague would return again the next day, and now was 
my time to get somethihg to refresh and support 
myself when I should be ill. And the first thing I 
did I filled a large square case-bottle with water, and 
set it upon my table, in reach of my bed; and to 
take off the chill or aguish disposition of the water, 
I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and 
mixed them together. Then I got me a piece of the 
goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but could eat 
very little. I walked about, but w'as very weak, and 
withal very sad and heavy-hearted in the sense of 
my miserable condition, dreading the return of my 
distemper the next day. At night I made my supper 
of three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the 



62 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

ashes, and eat, as we call it, in the shell; and this was 
the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing 
to, even as I could remember, in my whole life. 

After I had eaten, I tried to walk, but found myself 
so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun (for I 
never went out without that) ; so I went but a little 
way, and sat down upon the ground, looking out upon 
the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and 
smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as these 
occurred to me. 

That it must needs be that God had appointed all 
this to befall me; that I was brought to this miserable 
circumstance by His direction, He having the sole 
power, not of me only, but of everything that happened 
in the world. Immediately it followed. Why has God 
done this to me ? What have I done to be thus used ? 

My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, 
as if I had blasphemed, and methought it spoke to 
me like a voice: “ Wretch! dost thou ask what thou 
hast done ? Look back upon a dreadful misspent life, 
and ask thyself what thou hast not done? Ask, why 
is it that thou wert not 16ng ago destroyed? Why 
wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads; killed 
in the fight when the ship was taken by the Sallee 
man-of-war; devoured by the wild beast on the coast 
of Africa ? or drowned here, when all the crew perished 
but thyself? Dost thou ask, What have I done? ” 

I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one 
astonished, and had not a word to say, no, not to 
answer to myself, but rose up pensive and sad, walked 
back to my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if 
I had been going to bed. But my thoughts were sadly 
disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I sat 
down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began 



THE EARTHQUAKE 63 

to be dark. Now, as the apprehension of the return 
of my distemper terrified me very much, it occurred 
to my thought that the Brazilians take no physic but 
their tobacco for almost all distempers; and I had a 
piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which 
was quite cured, and some also that was green, and 
not quite cured. 

I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this 
chest I found a cure both for soul and body. I opened 
the chest, and found what I looked for, viz., the 
tobacco ; and as the few books I had saved lay there, 
too, I took out one of the Bibles which I mentioned 
before, and which to this time I had not found leisure, 
or so much as inclination, to look into. I say, I took 
it out, and brought both that and the tobacco with 
me to the table. 

What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to 
my distemper, or whether it was good for it or no; 
but I tried several experiments with it, as if I was 
resolved it should hit one way or other. I first took 
a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which 
indeed at first almost stupified my brain, the tobacco 
being green and strong, and that I had not been much 
used to it. Then I took some and steeped it an hour 
or two in some rum, and resolved to take a dose of it 
when I lay down. And lastly, I burnt some upon a 
pan of coals, and held my nose close over the smoke 
of it as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat, 
as almost for suffocation. 

In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible, 
and began to read, but my head was too much dis- 
turbed with the tobacco to bear reading, at least that 
time; only having opened the book casually, the first 
words that occurred to me were these, " Call on Me in 



64 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

the day of trouble, and I will deliver, and thou shalt 
glorify Me/' 

It grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said, 
dozed my head so much, that I inclined to sleep; so 
I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want 
anything in the night, and went to bed. But before 
I lay down, I did what I never had done in all my 
life; I kneeled down, and prayed to God to fulfil the 
promise to me, that if I called upon Him in the day 
of trouble, He would deliver me. After my broken 
and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in 
which I had steeped the tobacco; which was so strong 
and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I could scarce 
get it down. Immediately upon this I went to bed. 
I found presently it flew up in my head violently; 
but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more, till, 
by the sun, it must necessarily be near three o'clock 
in the afternoon the next day. Nay, to this hour I 
am partly of the opinion that I slept all the next day 
and night, and till almost three that day after; for 
otherwise I knew not how I should lose a day out of 
my reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared 
some years alter I had done. For if I had lost it by 
crossing and recrossing the line, I should have lost 
more than one day. But certainly I lost a day in my 
account, and never knew which way. 

Be that, however, one way or the other, when I 
awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my 
spirits lively and cheerful. When I got up, I was 
stronger than I was the day before, and my stomach 
better, for I was hungry; and, in short, I had no fit 
the next day, but continued much altered for the 
better. This was the 29th. 

The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went 



THE EARTHQUAKE 65 

abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too 
far. I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a brand- 
goose, and brought them home, but was not very 
forward to eat them ; so I eat some more of the turtle’s 
eggs, which were very good. This evening I renewed 
the medicine, which I had supposed did me good the 
day before, viz., the tobacco steeped in rum; only 
I did not take so much as before, nor did I chew any 
of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke. However, 
I was not so well the next day, which was the first 
of July, as I hoped I should have been; for I had a 
Little spice of the cold fit, but it was not much. 

July 4. — In the morning I took the Bible; and 
beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously 
to read it, and imposed upon myself to read awhile 
every morning and every night, not tying myself to 
the number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts 
should engage me. 

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, 
“ Call on Me, and I will deliver you,” in a different 
sense from what I had ever done before; for then I 
had no notion of anything being called deliverance 
but my being delivered from the captivity I was in! 
for though I was indeed at large in the place, yet the 
island was certainly a prison to me, and that in the 
worst sense in the world. But now I learned to take 
it in another sense; now I looked back upon my past 
life with such horror, and my sins appeared so dread- 
ful, that my soul sought nothing of God but deliverance 
from the load of guilt that bore down all my comfort. 

My condition began now to be, though not less 
miserable $s to my way of living, yet much easier to 
my mind; and my thoughts being directed, by a con- 
stant reading the Scripture, and praying to God, to 
c 



66 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of comfort 
within, which, till now, I knew nothing of. Also, as 
my health and strength returned, I bestirred myself 
to furnish myself with everything that I wanted, and 
make my way of living as regular as I could. 

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly 
employed in walking about with my gun in my hand, 
a little and a little at a time, as a man that was 
gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness; for 
it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, and to what 
weakness I was reduced. The application .which I 
made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps what had 
never cured an ague before; neither can I recommend 
it to any one to practise, by this experiment; and 
though it did carry off the fit, yet it rather contributed 
to weakening me; for I had frequent convulsions in 
my nerves and limbs for some time. 

I had been now in this unhappy island above ten 
months, all possibility of deliverance from this con- 
dition seemed to be entirely taken from me; and I 
firmly believed that no human shape had ever set 
foot upon that place. Having now secured my habita- 
tion, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great 
desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island, 
and to see what other productions I might find, which 
I yet knew nothing of. 


CHAPTER VII 

SURVEYING THE ISLAND 

It was the 15th of July that I began O to take a 
more particular survey of the island itself. I went up 
the creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts 



SURVEYING THE ISLAND 67 

on shore. I found after I came about two miles up, 
that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was 
no more than a little brook of running water, and 
very fresh and good; but this being the dry season, 
there was hardly any ‘water in some parts of it, at 
least, not enough to run in any stream, so as it could 
be perceived. 

On the bank of this brook I found many pleasant 
savannas or meadows, plain smooth, and covered with 
grass; and on the rising parts of them, next to the 
higher grounds, where the water, as might be supposed, 
never overflowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, 
green, and growing to a great and very strong stalk. 
There were divers other plants, which I had no notion 
of, or understanding about, and might perhaps have 
virtues of their own which I could not find out. 

I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians, 
in all that climate, make their bread of, but I could 
find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did not 
then understand them. I saw several sugar-canes, but 
wild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect. I con- 
tented myself with these discoveries for this time, and 
came back, musing with myself what course I might 
take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the 
fruits or plants which I should discover; but could 
bring it to no conclusion; for, in short, I had made 
so little observation while I’ was in the Brazils, that 
I knew little of the plants in the field, at least very 
little that might serve me to any purpose now in my 
distress. 

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way 
again; and after going something farther than I had 
gone the day before, I found the brook and the savannas 
began to cease, and the country became more woody 



68 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

than before. In this part I found different fruits, and 
particularly I found melons upon the ground in great 
abundance, and grapes upon the trees. The vines had 
spread indeed over the trees, and the clusters of grapes 
were just now in their prime, vfery ripe and rich. This 
was a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding glad 
of them; but I was warned by my experience to eat 
sparingly of them, remembering that when I was 
ashore in Barbary the eating of grapes killed several 
of our Englishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing 
them into fluxes and fevers. But I found an excellent 
use for these grapes ; and that was, to cure or dry them 
in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins 
are kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they 
were, as wholesome as agreeable to eat, when no 
grapes might be to be had. 

I spent all that evening there, and went not back 
to my habitation; which, by the way, was the first 
night, as I might say, I had lain from home. In the 
night, I took my first contrivance, and got up into a 
tree, where I slept well; and the next morning pro- 
ceeded upon my discovery, travelling near four miles, 
as I might judge by the length of the valley, keeping 
still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and 
north side of me. 

At the end of this march I came to an opening, 
where the country seemed to descend to the west; 
and a little spring of fresh water, which issued out of 
the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that is, 
due east ; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, 
so flourishing, everything being in a constant verdure 
or flourish of spring, that it looked like «a planted 
garden. 

I descended a" little on the side of that delicious 



SURVEYING THE ISLAND 


69 

vale, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure, though 
mixed with my other afflicting thoughts, to think that 
this was all my own ; that I was king and lord of all 
this country indefeasibly, and had a right of posses- 
sion; and, if I could convey it, I might have it in in- 
heritance as completely as any lord of a manor in 
England. I saw here abundance of cocoa trees, orange, 
and lemon, and citron trees; but all wild, and very 
few bearing any fruit, at least not then. However, the 
green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to 
eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice 
afterwards with water, which made it very wholesome, 
&nd very cool and refreshing. 

I found now I had business enough to gather and 
carry home; and I resolved to lay up a store, as well 
of grapes as limes and lemons to furnish myself for 
the wet season, which I knew was approaching. 

In order to this, I gathered a great heap of grapes 
in one place, and a lesser heap in another place, and a 
great parcel of limes and lemons in another place; 
and, taking a few of each with me, I travelled home- 
ward; and resolved to cbme again, and bring a bag 
or sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest home. 

Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, 
I came home (so I must now call my tent and my 
cave); but before I got thither, the grapes were 
spoiled; the richness of the fruits, and the weight of 
the juice, having broken them and bruised them; 
they were good for little or nothing: as to the limes, 
they were good, but I could bring but a few. 

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having 
made me two small bags to bring home my harvest; 
but I was surprised, when, coming to my heap of 
grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gathered 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


70 

them, I found them all spread about, trod to pieces, 
and dragged about, some here, some there, and abun- 
dance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded there 
were some wild creatures thereabouts, which had done 
this; but what they were, I knew not. 

However, as I found that there was no laying them 
up on heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack, 
but that one way they would be destroyed, and the 
other way they would be crushed with their own 
weight, I took another course; for I gathered a large 
quantity of the grapes, and hung them up upon the 
out-branches of the trees, that they might cure and 
dry in the sun; and as for the limes and lemons, I 
carried as many back as I could well stand under. 

When I came home from this journey, I contem- 
plated with great pleasure the fruitfulness of that 
valley, and the pleasantness of the situation; the 
security from storms on that side the water and the 
wood; and concluded that I had pitched upon a 
place to fix my abode, which was by far the worst 
part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to 
consider of removing my habitation, and to look out 
for a place equally safe as where I now was situate, 
if possible, in that pleasant fruitful part of the island. 

This thought ran long in my head, and I was ex- 
ceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of 
the place tempting me ; but when I came to a nearer 
view of it, and to consider that I was now by the sea- 
side, where it was at least possible that something 
might happen to my advantage, and, by the same ill 
fate that brought me hither, might bring some other 
unhappy wretches to the same place ; andr though it 
was scarce probable that any such thing should ever 
happen, yet to enclose myself among the hills and 



SURVEYING THE ISLAND 71 

woods in the centre of the island, was to anticipate 
my bondage, and to render such an affair not only 
improbable, but impossible; and that therefore I 
ought not by any means to remove. 

However, I was so enamoured of this place, that I 
spent much of my time there for the whole remaining 
part of the month of July; and though, upon second 
thoughts, I resolved, as above, not to remove, yet I 
built me a little kind of bower, and surrounded it at 
a distance with a strong fence, being a double hedge 
as high as I could reach, well staked, and filled between 
with brushwood. And here I lay very secure, some- 
times two or three nights together, always going over 
it with a ladder, as before; so that I fancied now I 
had my country house and my sea-coast house; and 
this work took me up to the beginning of August. 

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to 
enjoy my labour, but the rains came on, and made 
me stick close to my first habitation; for though I 
had made me a tent like the other, with a piece of a 
sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the shelter 
of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me 
to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary. 

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had 
finished my bower, and began to enjoy myself. The 
3rd of August, I found the grapes I had hung up 
were perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent good 
raisins of the sun ; so I began to take them down from 
the trees. And it was very happy that I did so, for 
the rains which followed would have spoiled them, 
and I had lost the best part of my winter food; for 
I had above two hundred large bunches of them. No 
sooner had I taken them all down, and carried most 
of them home to my cave, but it began to rain ; and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


72 

from hence, which was the 14th of August, it rained, 
more or less, every day till the middle of October, 
and sometimes so violently, that I could not stir out 
of my cave for several days. 

In this season, I was much surprised with the 
increase of my family. I had been concerned for the 
loss of one of my cats, who run away from me, or, 
as I thought, had been dead, and I heard no more 
tale or tidings of her, till, to my astonishment, she 
came home about the end of August with three kittens. 
But from these three cats I afterwards came to be so 
pestered with cats, that I was forced to kill them like 
vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them from my 
house as much as possible. 

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant 
rain, so that I could not stir, and was now very care- 
ful not to be much wet. In this confinement, I began 
to be straitened for food; but venturing out twice, 
I one day killed a goat, and the last day, which was 
the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which was a 
treat to me, and my food was regulated thus: I eat 
a bunch of raisins for my 'breakfast, a piece of the 
goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled; 
for, to my great misfortune, I had no vessel to boil 
or stew anything; and two or three of the turtle's 
eggs for my supper. 

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, 
I worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my 
cave, and by degrees worked it on towards one side, 
till I came to the outside of the hill, and made a door, 
or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall; and 
so I came in and out this way. But I was not perfectly 
easy at lying so open; for as I had managed myself 
before, I was in a perfect enclosure; whereas now, 



SURVEYING THE ISLAND 


73 

I thought I lay exposed, and open for anything to 
come in upon me; and yet I could not perceive that 
there was any living thing to fear, the biggest creature 
that I had yet seen upon the island being a goat. 

Sept . 30. — I was now come to the unhappy anni- 
versary of my landing. I cast up the notches on my 
post, and found I had been on shore three hundred 
and sixty-five days. I kept this day as a solemn 
fast, setting it apart to religious exercise. 

I had all this time observed no Sabbath day, for 
as at first I had no sense of religion upon my mind, 
I had, after some time, omitted to distinguish the 
weeks, by making a longer notch then ordinary for 
the Sabbath day, and so did not really know what 
any of the days were. But now, having cast up the days 
as above, I found I had been there a year, so I divided 
it into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a 
Sabbath; though I found at the end of my account, 
I had lost a day or two in my reckoning. 

A little after this my ink began to fail me, and so 
I contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to 
write down only the most Remarkable events of my life, 
without continuing a daily memorandum of other things. 

The rainy season and the dry season began now to 
appear regular to me, and I learned to divide them so 
as to provide for them accordingly; but I bought aU 
my experience before I had it, and this I am going to 
relate was one of the most discouraging experiments 
that I made at all. I have mentioned that I had 
saved the few ears of barley and rice, which I had so 
surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of them- 
selves, and*about twenty of barley ; and now I thought 
it a proper time to sow it after the rains, the sun 
being in its southern position, going from me. 

*c 



74 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground as well as 
I could with my wooden spade, and dividing it into 
two parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was sowing, 
it casually occurred to my thoughts that I would not 
sow it all at first, because I did not know when was 
the proper time for it, so I sowed about two-thirds 
of the seed, leaving about a handful of each. 

It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I 
did so, for not one grain of that I sowed this time 
came to anything, for the dry months following, the 
earth having had no rain after the seed was. sown, it 
had no moisture to assist its growth, and never came 
up at all till the wet season had come again, and then 
it grew as if it had been but newly sown. 

Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily 
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister 
piece of ground to make another trial in, and I dug 
up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed 
the rest of my seed in February, a little before the 
vernal equinox. And this having the rainy months of 
March and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, 
and yielded a very good crdp; but having part of the 
seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had, 
I had but a small quantity at last, my whole crop 
not amounting to above half a peck of each kind. 
But by this experiment I was made master of my 
business, and knew exactly when the proper season 
was to sow, and that I might expect two seed-times 
and two harvests every year. 

While this com was growing, I made a little dis- 
covery, which was of use to me afterwards. As soon 
as the rains were over, and the weather began to 
settle, which was about the month of November, I 
made a visit up the country to my bower, where. 



SURVEYING THE ISLAND 75 

though I had not been some months, yet I found all 
things just as I left them. The circle or double hedge 
that I had made was not only firm and entire, but the 
stakes which I had cut out of some trees that grew 
thereabouts were all shot out, and grown with long 
branches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the 
first year after lopping its head. I could not tell what 
tree to call it that these stakes were cut from. I was 
surprised, and yet very well pleased to see the young 
trees grow, and I pruned them, and led them up to 
grow as much alike as I could. And it is scarce credible 
how beautiful a figure they grew into in three years; 
so that though the hedge made a circle of about 
twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such 
I might now call them, soon covered it, and it was 
a complete shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry 
season. 

This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and 
make me a hedge like this, in a semicircle round my 
wall (I mean that of my first dwelling), which I did; 
and placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at 
about eight yards 1 distance from my first fence, they 
grew presently, and were at first a fine cover to my 
habitation, and afterward served for a defence also, 
as I shall observe in its order. 

I found now that the seasons of the year might 
generally be divided, not into summer and winter, as 
in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and the dry 
seasons. After I had found by experience the ill con- 
sequence of being abroad in the rain, I took care to 
furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I 
might not be obliged to go out; and I sat within 
doors as much as possible during the wet months. 

In this time I found much employment, and very 



76 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

suitable also to the time, for I found great occasion of 
many things which I had no way to furnish myself 
with but by hard labour and constant application; 
particularly I tried many ways to make myself a 
basket; but all the twigs I could get for the purpose 
proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It 
proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when 
I was a boy I used to take a great delight in standing 
at a basket-maker's in the town where my father 
lived, to see them make their wicker- ware; and being, 
as boys usually are, very officious to help, and a great 
observer of the manner how they worked those things, 
and sometimes lending a hand, I had by this means 
full knowledge of the methods of it, that I wanted 
nothing but the materials; when it came into my 
mind that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut 
my stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the 
sallows, and willows, and osiers in England, and I 
resolved to try. 

Accordingly, the next day, I went to my country 
house, as I called it ; and cutting some of the smaller 
twigs, I found them to m^ purpose as much as I 
could desire; whereupon I came the next time pre- 
pared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which 
I soon found, for there was great plenty of them. 
These I set up to .dry within my circle or hedge, and 
when they were fit for use, I carried them to my 
cave; and here during the next season I employed 
myself in making, as well as I could, a great many 
baskets, both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up 
anything as I had occasion. And though I did not 
finish them very handsomely, yet I made them suffici- 
ently serviceable for my purpose. And thus, afterwards, 
I took care never to be without them; and as my 



SURVEYING THE ISLAND 77 

wicker-ware decayed, I made more, especially I made 
strong deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of 
sacks, when I should come to have any quantity of it. 

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a 
world of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if 
possible, how to supply two wants. I had no vessels 
to hold anything that was liquid, except two runlets, 
which were almost full of rum, and some glass bottles, 
some of the common size, and others which were case- 
bottles square, for the holding of waters, spirits, etc. 
I had not so much as a pot to boil anything, except a 
great kettle, which I saved out of the ship, and which 
was too big for such use as I desired it, viz., to make 
broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The second 
thing I would fain have had was a tobacco-pipe; but 
it was impossible to me to make one. However, I 
found a contrivance for that, too, at last. 

I employed myself in planting my second rows of 
stakes or piles and in this wicker-working all the 
summer or dry season, when another business took 
me up more time than it could be imagined I could 
spare. 

I mentioned before that I had a great mind to see 
the whole island, and that I had travelled up the brook, 
and so on to where I built my bower, and where I had 
an opening quite to the sea, on the other side of the 
island. I now resolved to travel quite across to the 
seashore on that side; so taking my gun, a hatchet, 
and my dog, and a larger quantity of powder and 
shot than usual, with two biscuit-cakes and a great 
bunch of raisins in my pouch for my store, I began 
my journey. When I had passed the vale where my 
bower stood, as above, I came within view of the sea 
to the west; and it being a very clear day, I fairly 



78 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

descried land, whether an island or a continent I could 
not tell; but it lay very high, extending from the west 
to the W.S.W. at a very great distance; by my guess, 
it could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off. 

I saw abundance of parrots, and fain I would have 
caught one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, 
and taught it to speak to me. I did, after some pains- 
taking, catch a young parrot, for I knocked it down 
with a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it 
home; but it was some years before I could make him 
speak. However, at last I taught him to call me by my 
name very familiarly. But the accident that followed, 
though it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its place. 

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I 
found in the low grounds hares, as I thought them to 
be, and foxes; but they differed greatly from all the 
other kinds I had met with, nor could I satisfy myself 
to eat them, though I killed several. But I had no 
need to be venturous, for I had no want of food, and 
of that which was very good too, especially these 
three sorts, viz., goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise; 
which, added to my grapes, ‘Leadenhall Market could 
not have furnished a table better than I, in proportion 
to the company. And though my case was deplorable 
enough, yet I had great cause for thankfulness, and 
that I was not driven to any extremities for food, 
but rather plenty, even to dainties. 

I never travelled in this journey above two miles 
outright in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so 
many turns and returns, to see what discoveries I 
could make, that I came weary enough to the place 
where I resolved to sit down for all night ; *and then 
I either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded myself 
with a row of stakes, set upright in the ground, either 



SURVEYING THE ISLAND 79 

from one tree to another, or so as no wild creature 
could come at me without waking me. 

As soon as I came to the seashore, I was surprised 
to see that I had taken up my lot on the worst side 
of the island, for here indeed the shore was covered 
with innumerable turtles ; whereas, on the other side, 
I had found but three in a year and a half. Here was 
also an infinite number of fowls of many kinds, some 
which I had seen, and some which I had not seen of 
before, and many of them very good meat, but such as I 
knew not the names of, except those called penguins. 

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was 
very sparing of my powder and shot, and therefore 
had more mind to kill a she-goat, if I could, which I 
could better feed on; and though there were many 
goats here, more than on my side the island, yet it 
was with much more difficulty that I could come near 
them, the country being flat and even, and they saw 
me much sooner than when I was on the hill. 

I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter 
than mine; but yet I had not the least inclination to 
remove, for as I was fixed in my habitation, it became 
natural to me, and I seemed all the while I was here 
to be as it were upon a journey, and from home. 
However, I travelled along the shore of the sea towards 
the east, I suppose about twelve miles, and then setting 
up a great pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded 
I would go home again; and that the next journey 
I took should be on the other side of the island, east 
from my dwelling, and so round till I came to my 
post again ; of which in its place. 

I took another way to come back than that I went, 
thinking I could easily keep all the island so much in 
my view, that I could not miss finding my first 



8o ROBINSON CRUSOE 

dwelling by viewing the country. But I found myself 
mistaken. I wandered about very uncomfortably, and 
at last was obliged to find out the seaside, look for my 
post, and come back the same way I went; and then 
by easy journeys I turned homeward, the weather 
being exceeding hot, and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, 
and other things very heavy. 

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, 
and seized upon it, and I running in to take hold of 
it, caught it, and saved it alive from the dog. I had 
a great mind to bring it home if I could, for I had 
often been musing whether it might not be possible 
to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame 
goats, which might supply me when my powder and 
shot should all be spent. 

I made a collar to this little creature, and with a 
string, which I made of some rope-yarn, which I 
always carried about me, I led him along, though 
with some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and 
there I enclosed him and left him, for I was very im- 
patient to be at home, from whence I had been absent 
above a month. 

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me 
to come into my old hutch, and lie down in my 
hammock-bed. This little wandering journey, without 
settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me, 
that my own house, as I called it to myself, was a 
perfect settlement to me compared to that; and it 
rendered everything about me so comfortable, that I 
resolved I would never go a great way from it again, 
while it should be my lot to stay on the island. 

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale 
myself after my long journey; during which most of 
the time was taken up in the weighty affair of making 



A HAPPY LIFE 81 

a cage for my Poll, who began now to be a mere 
domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted with me. 
Then I began to think of the poor kid which I had 
penned in within my little circle, and resolved to go 
go and fetch it home, or give it some food. Accordingly 
I went, and found it where I left it, for indeed it could 
not get out, but almost starved for want of food. I 
went and cut boughs of trees, and branches of such 
shrubs as I could find, and threw it over, and having 
fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead it away; but 
it was so tame with being hungry, that I had no need 
to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog. And as 
I continually fed it the creature became so loving, so 
gentle, and so fond, that it became from that time 
one of my domestics also, and would never leave me 
afterwards. 

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now 
come, and I kept the 30th of September in the same 
solemn manner as before, being the anniversary of 
my landing on the island, having now been there two 
years, and no more prospect of being delivered than 
the first day I came there.* I spent the whole day in 
humble and thankful acknowledgments of the many 
wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was 
attended with, and without which it might have been 
infinitely more miserable. 


CHAPTER VIII 

A HAPPY LIFE 

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more 
happy this life I now led was, with all its miserable 
circumstances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable 



82 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

life I led all the past part of my days. And now 
I changed both my sorrows and my joys; my very 
desires altered, my affections changed their gusts, 
and my delights were perfectly new from what they 
were at my first coming, or indeed for the two years 
past. 

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my 
third year; and though I have not given the reader 
the trouble of so particular account of my works this 
year as the first, yet in general it may be observed, 
that I was very seldom idle, but having- regularly 
divided my time, according to the several daily employ- 
ments that were before me, such as, first, my duty to 
God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I con- 
stantly set apart some time for, thrice every day; 
secondly, the going abroad with my gun for food, 
which generally took me up three hours in every 
morning, when it did not rain; thirdly, the ordering, 
curing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed or 
catched for my supply; these took up great part of 
the day; also, it is to be % considered that the middle 
of the day, when the sim was in the zenith, the 
violence of the heat was too great to stir out; so 
that about four hours in the evening was all the time 
I could be supposed to work in, with this exception, 
that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and 
working, and went to work in the morning, and abroad 
with my gun in the afternoon. 

To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may 
be added the exceeding laboriousness of my work ; the 
many hours which, for want of tools, want of help, 
and want of skill, everything I did took ap out of my 
time. For example, I was full two and forty days 
making me a board for a long shelf, which I wanted 



A HAPPY LIFE 83 

in my cave; whereas two sawyers, with their tools 
and a sawpit, would have cut six of them out of the 
same tree in half a day. 

My case was this: it was to be a large tree which 
was to be cut down, because my board was to be a 
broad one. This tree I was three days a-cutting down, 
and two more cutting off the boughs, and reducing 
it to a log, or piece of timber. With inexpressible 
hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it 
into chips till it began to be light enough to move; 
then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and 
flat as a board from end to end; then turning that 
side downward, cut the other side, till I brought the 
plank to be about about three inches thick, and smooth 
on both sides. Anyone may judge the labour of my 
hands in such a piece of work ; but labour and patience 
carried me through that, and many other things. I 
only observe this in particular, to show the reason why 
so much of my time went away with so little work, 
viz., that what might be a little to be done with help 
and tools, was a vast labour, and required a prodigious 
time to do alone, and by hand. But notwithstanding 
this, with patience and labour, I went through many 
things, and, indeed, everything that my circumstances 
made necessary to me to do, as will appear by what 
follows. 

I was now, in the months of November and Decem- 
ber, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The ground 
I had manured or dug up for them was not great ; for 
as I observed, my seed of each was not above the 
quantity of half a peck; for I had lost one whole crop 
by sowing In the dry season. But now my crop 
promised very well, when on a sudden I found I was 
in danger of losing it all again by enemies of several 



84 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep from it; 
as, first the goats and wild creatures which I called 
hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay in 
it night and day, as soon as it came up, and eat it 
so close, that it could get no time to shoot up into 
stalk. 

This I saw no remedy for but by making an en- 
closure about it with a hedge, which I did with a great 
deal of toil, and the more, because it required speed. 
However, as my arable land was but small, suited to 
my crop, I got it totally well fenced in about three 
weeks’ time, and shooting some of the creatures in 
the daytime, I set my dog to guard it in the night, 
tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he would 
stand and bark all night long; so in a little time the 
enemies forsook the place, and the com grew very 
strong and well, and began to ripen apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me before while my com 
was in the blade, so the birds were as likely to min 
me now when it was in the ear ; for going along by the 
place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop sur- 
rounded with fowls, of I know not how many sorts, 
who stood, as it were, watching till I should be gone. 
I immediately let fly among them, for I always had 
my gun with me. I had no sooner shot, but there 
rose up a little cloud of fowls, which I had not seen 
at all, from among the com itself. 

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few 
days they would devour all my hopes, that I should 
be starved, and never be able to raise a crop at all, 
and what to do I could not tell. However, I resolved 
not to lose my com, if possible, though I should 
watch it night and day. In the first place I went 
among it to see what damage was already done, and 



A HAPPY LIFE 85 

found they had spoiled a good deal of it; but that 
as it was yet too green for them, the loss was not so 
great but that the remainder was like to be a good 
crop if it could be saved. 

I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming 
away, I could easily see the thieves sitting upon all 
the trees about me, as if they only waited till I was 
gone away. And the event proved it to be so ; for as 
I walked off, as if I was gone, I was no sooner out 
of their sight but they dropped down, one by one, 
into the com again. I was so provoked, that I could 
not have patience to stay till more came on, knowing 
that every grain that they eat now was, as it might 
be said, a peck-loaf to me in the consequence; but 
coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed three 
of them. This was what I wished for; so I took them 
up, and served them as we serve notorious thieves in 
England, viz., hanged them in chains, for a terror to 
others. It is impossible to imagine almost that this 
should have such an effect as it had, for the fowls 
would not only not come at the com, but, in short, 
they forsook all that part *of the island, and I could 
never see a bird near the place as long as my scare- 
crows hung there. 

This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and 
about the latter end of December, which was our 
second harvest of the year, I reaped my crop. 

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to cut 
it down, and all I could do was to make one as well 
as I could out of one of the broadswords, or cutlasses, 
which I saved among the arms out of the ship. How- 
ever, as my. first crop was but small, I had no great 
difficulty to cut it down; in short, I reaped it my 
way; for I cut nothing off but the ears, and carried 



86 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

it away in a great basket which I had made, and so 
rubbed it out with my hands; and at the end of all 
my harvesting, I found that out of my half peck of 
seed I had near two bushels of rice, and above two 
bushels and a half of barley, that is to say, by my 
guess, for I had no measure at that time. 

However, this was a great encouragement to me, 
and I foresaw that, in time, it would please God to 
supply with me bread. And yet here I was perplexed 
again, for I neither knew how to grind or make meal 
of my com, or indeed how to clean it and part it; 
nor, if made into meal, how to make bread of it, and 
if how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it. 
These things being added to my desire of having a 
good quantity for store, and to secure a constant 
supply, I resolved not to taste any of this crop, but 
to preserve it all for seed against the next season, 
and, in the meantime, to employ all my study and 
hours of working to accomplish this great work of 
providing myself with com and bread. 

Within doors, that is, when it rained, and I could 
not go out, I found employment on the following 
occasions; always observing, that all the while I was 
at work, I diverted myself with talking to my parrot, 
and teaching him to speak, and I quickly learned him 
to know his own name, and at last to speak it out 
pretty loud, “ Ppll,” which was the first word I ever 
heard spoken in the island by any mouth but my own. 
This, therefore, was not my work, but an assistant to 
my work; for now, as I said, I had a great employment 
upon my hands, as follows, viz., I had long studied, 
by some means or other, to make myself some earthen 
vessels, which indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not 
tfhere to come at them. However, considering the 



A HAPPY LIFE 87 

heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could 
find out any such clay, I might botch up some such 
pot as might, being dried in the sun, be hard enough 
and strong enough to bear handling, and to hold any- 
thing that was dry, and required to be kept so; and 
as this was necessary in the preparing com, meal, etc., 
which was the thing I was upon, I resolved to make 
some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like 
jars, to hold what should be put into them. 

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh 
at me, to tell how many awkward ways I took to 
raise this paste; what odd, misshapen, ugly things I 
made; how many of them fell in, and how many fell 
out, the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own 
weight; how many cracked by the over- violent heat 
of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how many 
fell in pieces with only removing, as well before as 
after they were dried; and* in a word, how, after 
having laboured hard to find the clay, to dig it, to 
temper it, to bring it home, and work it, I could 
not make above two large earthen ugly things (I 
cannot call them jars) in about two months* labour. 

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and 
hard, I lifted them very gently up, and set them down 
again in two great wicker baskets, which I had made 
on purpose for them that they might not break; and 
as between the pot and the basket there was a little 
room to spare, I stuffed it full of the rice and barley 
straw, and these two pots being to stand always dry, 
I thought would hold my dry com, and perhaps the 
meal, when the com was bruised. 

Though l miscarried so much in my design for 
large pots, yet I made several smaller things with 
better success; such as little round pots, flat dishes, 



88 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

pitchers, and pipkins, and any things my hand turned 
to; and the heat of the sun baked them strangely 
hard. But all this would not answer my end, which 
was to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, 
and bear the fire, which none of these could do. It 
happened after some time, making a pretty large fire 
for cooking my meat, when I went to put it out after 
I had done with it, I found a broken piece of one of 
my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as 
a stone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised 
to see it, and said to myself, that certainly they might 
be made to bum whole, if they would bum broken. 

This set me to studying how to order my fire, so 
as to make it bum me some pots. I had no notion 
of a kiln, such as the potters bum in, or of glazing 
them with lead, though I had some lead to do it with; 
but I placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots 
in a pile, one upon another, and placed my firewood 
all round it, with a great heap of embers under them. 
I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and 
upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot 
quite through, and observfed that they did not crack 
at all. When I saw them clear red, I let them stand 
in that heat about five or six hours, till I found one 
of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run, 
for the sand which was mixed with the clay melted 
by the violence gf the heat, and would have run into 
glass, if I had gone on ; so I slacked my fire gradually 
till the pots began to abate of the red colour; and 
watching them all night, that I might not let the fire 
abate too fast, in the morning I had three very good, 
I will not say handsome, pipkins, and. two other 
earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired, and one 
of them perfectly glazed with the running of the sand. 



A HAPPY LIFE 89 

After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted 
no sort of earthenware for my use; but I must needs 
say, as to the shapes of them, they were very in- 
different, as anyone may suppose, when I had no way 
of making them but as the children make dirt pies, or 
as a woman would make pies that never learned to 
raise paste. 

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever 
equal to mine, when I found I had made an earthen 
pot that would bear the fire; and I had hardly 
patience to stay till they were cold, before I set one 
upon the fire again, with some water in it, to boil 
me some meat, which it did admirably well; and with 
a piece of a kid I made some very good broth, though I 
wanted oatmeal and several other ingredients requisite 
to make it so good as I would have had it. 

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to 
stamp or beat some com in; for as to the mill, there 
was no thought at arriving to that perfection of art 
with one pair of hands. I spent many a day to find 
out a great stone big enough to cut hollow, and make 
fit for a mortar, and could find none at all, except 
what was in the solid rock, and which I had no way 
to dig or cut out; nor indeed were the rocks in the 
island of hardness sufficient, but were all of a sandy 
crumbling stone, which neither would bear the weight 
of a heavy pestle, or would break the corn without 
filling it with sand. So, after a great deal of time lost 
in searching for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved 
to look out for a great block of hard wood, which I 
found indeed much easier; and getting one as big as 
I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it in 
the outside with my axe and hatchet, and then, with 
the help of fire, and infinite 'labour, made a hollow 



go ROBINSON CRUSOE 

place in it, as the Indians in Brazil make their canoes. 
After this, I made a great heavy pestle, or beater, of 
the wood called the iron- wood; and this I prepared 
and laid by against I had my next crop of corn, when 
I proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound, my 
com into meal, to make my bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a sieve, or search, 
to dress my meal, and to part it from the bran and 
the husk, without which I did not see it possible I 
could have any bread. This was a most difficult thing, 
so much as but to think on, for to be sure I had nothing 
like the necessary thing to make it ; I mean fine thin 
canvas or stuff, to search the meal through. And here 
I was at a full stop for many months, nor did I really 
know what to do; linen I had none left, but what was 
mere rags; I had goats'-hair, but neither knew I how 
to weave it or spin it; and had I known how, here 
was no tools to work it with. All the remedy that I 
found for this was, that at last I did remember I had, 
among the seamen's clothes which were saved out of 
the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin; and 
with some pieces of these 1 I made three small sieves, 
but proper enough for the work; and thus I made 
shift for some years. How I did afterwards, I shall 
show in its place. 

The baking part was the next thing to be con- 
sidered, and how I should make bread when I came 
to have corn; for, first, I had not yeast. As to that 
part, as there was no supplying the want, so I did 
not concern myself much about it; but for an oven 
I was indeed in great pain. At length I found out an 
experiment for that also, which was this : «I made some 
earthen vessels very broad, but not deep, that is to 
say, about two feet diameter, and not above nine 



A HAPPY LIFE 91 

inches deep; these I burned in the fire, as I had done 
the other, and laid them by; and when I wanted to 
bake, I made a great fire upon my hearth, which I 
had paved with some square tiles, of my own making 
and burning also; but I should not call them square. 

When the firewood was burned pretty much into 
embers, or live coals, I drew them forward upon this 
hearth, so as to cover it all over, and there I let them 
lie till the hearth was very hot; then sweeping away 
all the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves, and 
whelming down the earthen pot upon them, drew the 
embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep in and 
add to the heat. And thus, as well as in the best oven 
in the world, I baked my barley-loaves, and became, 
in little time, a mere pastry-cook into the bargain; for 
I made myself several cakes of the rice, and puddings; 
indeed I made no pies, neither had I anything to put 
into them, supposing I had, except the flesh either of 
fowls or goats. 

It need not be wondered at, if all these things took 
me up most part of the third year of my abode here; 
for it is to be observed, that in the intervals of these 
things I had my new harvest and husbandry to manage ; 
for I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it home 
as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear, in my large 
baskets, till I had time to rub it out, for I had no floor 
to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with. 

And now, indeed, my stock of com increasing, I 
really wanted to build my barns bigger. I wanted a 
place to lay it up in, for the increase of the com now 
yielded me so much, that I had of the barley about 
twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or more, in- 
somuch that now I resolved to begin to use it freely; 
for my bread had been quite gone a great while; also, 



93 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

I resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient for 
me a whole year, and to sow but once a year. 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of 
barley and rice was much more than I could consume 
in a year; so I resolved to sow just the same quantity 
every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such 
a quantity would fully provide me with bread, etc. 

CHAPTER IX 

THE BOAT 

All the while these things were doing, you may be 
sure my thoughts run many times upon the prospect 
of land which I had seen from the other side of the 
island, and I was not without secret wishes that I 
were on shore there, fancying the seeing the mainland, 
and in an inhabited country, I might find some way 
or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at last 
find some means of escape. 

But all this while I made no allowance for the 
dangers of such a condition, and how I might fall into 
the hands of savages, and perhaps such as I might 
have reason to think far worse than the lions and 
tigers of Africa; that if I once came into their power, 
I should run a hazard more than a thousand to one 
of being killed/ and perhaps of being eaten ; for I had 
heard that the people of the Caribbean coasts were 
cannibals, or man-eaters, and I knew by the latitude 
that I could not be far off from that shore. That 
suppose they were not cannibals, yet that they might 
kill me, as many Europeans who had fallen into their 
hands had been served, even when they had been ten 
or twenty together, much more I, that was but one; 



THE BOAT 93 

and could make little or no defence; all these things, 
I say, which I ought to have considered well of, and did 
cast up in my thoughts afterwards, yet took up none 
of my apprehensions at first, but my head ran mightily 
upon the thought of getting over to the shore. 

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat 
with the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed 
above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa; but 
this was in vain. Then I thought I would go and look 
at our ship’s boat, which, as I have said, was blown 
up upon the shore a great way, in the storm, when 
we were first cast away/ She lay almost where she did 
at first, but not quite; and was turned, by the force 
of the waves and the winds, almost bottom upward,, 
against a high ridge of beachy rough sand, but no 
water about her, as before. 

If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to 
have launched her into the water, the boat would have 
done well enough, and I might have gone back into 
the Brazils with her easily enough ; but I might have 
foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her 
upright upon her bottom, 'than I could remove the 
island. However, I went to the woods, and cut levers 
and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolved to 
try what I could do; suggesting to myself that if I 
could but turn her down, I might easily repair the 
damage she had received, and she would be a very 
good boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily. 

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless 
toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it. 
At last, finding it impossible to heave it up with my 
little strength, I fell to digging away the sand, to 
undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting 
pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the 



94 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

fall. But when I had done this, I was unable to stir 
it up again, or to get under it, much less to move it 
forward towards the water; so I was forced to give 
it over. And yet, though I gave over the hopes of the 
boat, my desire to venture over for the main increased, 
rather than decreased, as the means for it seemed 
impossible. 

This at length put me upon thinking whether it 
was not possible to make myself a canoe, or periagua , 
such as the natives of those climates make, even with- 
out tools, or, as I might say, without hands, viz., ol 
the trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought 
possible, but easy, and pleased myself extremely with 
the thoughts of making it, and with my having much 
more convenience for it than any of the negroes or 
Indians; but not at all considering the particular 
inconveniences which I lay under more than the Indians 
did, viz., want of hands to move it, when it was made, 
into the water, a difficulty much harder for me to 
surmount than all the consequences of want of tools 
could be to them. For what was it to me, that when 
I had chosen a vast tree* in the woods, I might with 
much trouble cut it down, if, after I might be able 
with my tools to hew and dub the outside into the 
proper shape of a boat, and bum or cut out the inside 
to make it hollow, so to make a boat of it; if, after 
all this, I must- leave it just there where I found it, 
and was not able to launch it into the water? 

One would have thought I could not have had the 
least reflection upon my mind of my circumstance 
while I was making this boat, but I should have 
immediately thought how I should get iteinto the sea; 
but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over 
the sea in it, that I never once considered how I should 



THE BOAT 95 

get it off of the land; and it was really, in its own 
nature, more easy for me to guide it over forty-five 
miles of sea, than about forty-five fathoms of land, 
where it lay, to set it afloat in the water. 

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool 
that ever man did who had any of his senses awake. 
I pleased myself with the design, without determining 
whether I was ever able to undertake it. Not but 
that the difficulty of launching my boat came often 
into my head ; but” I put a stop to my own inquiries 
into it, by this foolish answer which I gave myself, 
“ Let's first make it; I’ll warrant I’ll find some way 
or other to get it along when , tis done." 

This was a most preposterous method; but the 
eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went. 
I felled a cedar tree : I question much whether Solomon 
ever had such a one for the building of the Temple at 
Jerusalem. It was five feet ten inches diameter at the 
lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven inches 
diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which 
it lessened for a while, and then parted into branches. 
It was not without infinite* labour that I felled this 
tree. I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at 
the bottom; I was fourteen more getting the branches 
and limbs, and the vast spreading head of it cut off, 
which I hacked and hewed through with axe and 
hatchet, and inexpressible labour. After this, it cost 
me a month to shape it and dub it to q proportion, 
and to something like the bottom of a boat, that it 
might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me near 
three months more to clear the inside, and work it 
so as to maKp an exact boat of it. This I did, indeed, 
without fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the 
dint of hard labour, till I had brought it to be a very 



96 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

handsome periagua , and big enough to have carried 
six and twenty men, and consequently big enough to 
have carried me and all my cargo. 

When I had gone through this work, I was ex- 
tremely delighted with it. The boat was really much 
bigger than I ever saw a canoe or periagua, that was 
made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary stroke 
it had cost, you may be sure; and there remained 
nothing but to get it into the water; and had I gotten 
it into the water, I make no question but I should 
have begun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely 
to be performed, that ever was undertaken. 

But all my devices to get it into the water failed 
me, though they cost me infinite labour too. It lay 
about one hundred yards from the water, and not 
more; but the first inconvenience was, it was uphill 
towards the creek. Well, to take away this discourage- 
ment, I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth, 
and so make a declivity. This I began, and it cost 
me a prodigious deal of pains; but who grudges pains, 
that have their deliverance in view? But when this 
was worked through, and this difficulty managed, it 
was still much at one, for I could no more stir the 
canoe than I could the other boat* 

Then I measured the distance of ground, and re- 
solved to cut a dock or canal, to bring the water up 
to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down 
to the water. Well, I began this work; and when I 
began to enter into it, and calculate how deep it was 
to be dug, how broad, how the stuff to be thrown 
out, I found that by the number of hands I had, being 
none but my own, it must have been ten or twelve 
years before I should have gone through with it; for 
the shore lay high, so that at the upper end it must 



THE BOAT 97 

have been at least twenty feet deep; so at length, 
though with great reluctancy, I gave this attempt 
over also. 

This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though 
too late, the folly of beginning a work before we count 
the cost, and before we judge rightly of our own 
strength to go through with it. 

In the middle of this work I finished my fourth 
year in this place, and kept my anniversary with the 
same devotion, and with as much comfort as ever 
before; for, by constant study and serious application 
of the Word of God, and by the assistance of His 
grace, I gained a different knowledge from what I 
had before. I entertained different notions of things. 
I looked now upon the world as a thing remote, which 
I had nothing to do with, no expectation from, and, 
indeed, no desires about. In a word, I had nothing 
indeed to do with it, nor was ever like to have; so I 
thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon it 
hereafter, viz., as a place I had lived in, but was come 
out of it ; and well might I say, as father Abraham to 
Dives, “ Between me and thee is a great gulf fixed." 

I had now brought my state of life to be much easier 
in itself than it was at first, and much easier to my 
mind, as well as to my body. I frequently sat down 
to my meat with thankfulness,, and admired the hand 
of God's providence, which had thus spread my table 
in the wilderness. I learned to look more upon the 
bright side of my condition, and less upon the dark 
side, and to consider what I enjoyed, rather than 
what I wanted; and this gave me sometimes such 
secret comforts, that I cannot express them; and 
which I take notice of here, to put those discontented 
people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably 

D 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


98 

what God has given them, because they see and covet 
something that He has not given them. All our dis- 
contents about what we want, appeared to me to spring 
from the want of thankfulness for what we have. 

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in re- 
presenting to myself, in the most lively colours, how 
I must have acted if I had got nothing out of the 
ship. How I could not have so much as got any food, 
except fish and turtles; and that as it was long before 
I found any of them, I must have perished first; that 
I should have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere 
savage; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by any 
contrivance, I had no way to flay or open them, or 
part the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut 
it up; but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it 
with my claws, like a beast. 

These reflections made me very sensible of the good- 
ness of Providence to me, and very thankful for my 
present condition, with all its hardships and mis- 
fortunes. 

In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, 
so it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted 
nothing to make it a life of comfort, but to be able 
to make my sense of God's goodness to me, and care 
over me in this condition, be my daily consolation; 
and after I did make a just improvement of these 
things, I went away, and was no more sad. 

I had not been here so long, that many things which 
I brought on shore for my help were either quite gone, 
or very much wasted, and near spent. My ink, as I 
observed, had been gone for some time, all but a very 
little, which I eked out with water, a little*and a little, 
till it was so pale it scarce left any appearance of black 
upon the paper. As long as it lasted, I made use of 



THE BOAT 99 

it to minute down the days of the month on which 
any remarkable thing happened to me. And, first, 
by casting up times past, I remember that there 
was a strange concurrence of days in the various 
providences which befell me, and which, if I had 
been superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal 
or fortunate, I might have had reason to have looked 
upon with a great deal of curiosity. 

First, I had observed that the same day that I 
broke away from my father and my friends, and ran 
away to Hull, in order to go to sea, the same day 
afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and 
made a slave. 

The same day of the year that I escaped out of the 
wreck of that ship in Yarmouth Roads, that same 
day-year afterwards I made my escape from Sallee in 
the boat. 

The same day of the year I was bom on, viz., the 
30th of September, that same day I had my life so 
miraculously saved twenty-six years after, when I 
was cast on shore in thisjsland; so that my wicked 
life and my solitary life began both on a day. 

The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was that 
of my bread; I mean the biscuit/ which I brought 
out of the ship. This I had husbanded to the last 
degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a day 
for above a year; and yet I was quite without bread 
for near a year before I got any corn of my own; and 
great reason I had to be thankful that I had any at 
all, the getting it being, as has been already observed, 
next to miraculous. 

My clothes began to decay, too, mightily. As to 
linen, I had none a good while, except some chequered 
shirts which I found in the chests of the other seamen, 



xoo ROBINSON CRUSOE 

and which I carefully preserved, because many times 
I could bear no other clothes on but a shirt; and it 
was a very great help to me that I had, among all the 
men's clothes of the ship, almost three dozen of shirts. 
There were also several thick watch-coats of the sea- 
men's which were left indeed, but they were too hot 
to wear; and though it is true that the weather was 
so violent hot that there was no need of clothes, yet 
I could not go quite naked, no, though I had been 
inclined to it, which I was not, though I was all alone. 

The reason why I could not go quite naked was, I 
could not bear the heat of the sun so well when quite 
naked as with some clothes on; nay, the very heat 
frequently blistered my skin; whereas, with a shirt 
on, the air itself made some motion, and whistling 
under that shirt, was two-fold cooler than without it. 
No more could I ever bring myself to go out in the 
heat of the sun without a cap or a hat. The heat of 
the sun beating with such violence, as it does in that 
place, would give me the headache presently, by 
darting so directly on my head, without a cap or hat 
on, so that I could not bear it; whereas, if I put on 
my hat, it would presently go away. 

Upon those views, I began to consider about putting 
the few rags I had, which I called clothes, into some 
order. I had worn out all the waistcoats I had, and 
my business was now to try if I could not make 
jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by 
me, and with such other materials as I had; so I set 
to work a-tailoring, or rather, indeed, a-botching, for I 
made most piteous work of it. However, I made shift to 
make two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would 
serve me a great while. As for breeches, or drawers, 
I made but a very sorry shift indeed till afterward. 



IOI 


THE BOAT 

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the 
creatures that I killed, I mean four-footed ones, and 
I had hung them up stretched out with sticks in the 
sun, by which means some of them were so dry and 
hard that they were fit for little, but others it seems 
were very useful. The first thing I made of these was 
a great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside 
to shoot off the rain; and this I performed so well, 
that after this I made me a suit of clothes wholly of 
these skins, that is to say, a waistcoat, and breeches 
open at knees, and both loose, for they were rather 
wanting to keep me cool than to keep me warm. 
I must not omit to acknowledge that they were 
wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter, I was 
a worse tailor. However, they were such as I made 
very good shift with; and when I was abroad, if it 
happened to rain, the hair of my waistcoat and cap 
being outermost, I was kept very dry. 

After this I spent a great deal of time and pains to 
make me an umbrella. I was indeed in great want 
of one, and had a great mind to make one. I had seen 
them made in the Brazils; where they are very useful 
in the great heats, which are there ; and I felt the heats 
every jot as great here, and greater too, being nearer 
the equinox. Besides, as I was obliged to be much 
abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well for 
the rains as the heats. I took a world of pains at it, 
and was a great while before I could make anything 
likely to hold : nay, after I thought I had hit the way, 
I spoiled two or three before I made one to my mind ; 
but .at last I made one that answered indifferently 
well. The.main difficulty I found was to make it to 
let down. I could make it to spread; but if it did 
not let down too, and draw in, it was not portable 



102 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

for me any way but just over my head, which would 
not do. However, at last, as I said, I made one to 
answer, and covered it with skins, the hair upwards, 
so that it cast off the rains like a pent-house, and 
kept off the sun so effectually, that I could walk out 
in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage 
than I could before in the coolest; and when I had 
no need of it, could close it, and carry it under my 
arm. 

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being 
entirely composed by resigning to the will of God, 
and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of His 
providence. 

I cannot say that after this, for five years, any 
extraordinary thing happened to me; but I lived on 
in the same course, in the same posture and place, 
just as before. The chief things I was employed in, 
besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and 
rice, and curing my raisins, of both which I always 
kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one 
year’s provisions beforehand — I say, besides this yearly 
labour, and my daily labour of going out with my gun, 
I had one labour, to make me a canoe, which at last 
I finished ; so that by digging a canal to it of six feet 
wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek, 
almost half a mile. As for the first, which was so 
vastly big, as I made it without considering before- 
hand, as I ought to do, how I should be able to launch 
it; so, never being able to bring it to the water, or 
bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where 
it was, as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser 
next time. Indeed, the next time, though ,1 could not 
get a tree proper for it, and in a place where I could 
not get the water to it at any less distance than, as 



THE BOAT 103 

I have said, near half a mile, yet as I saw it was prac- 
ticable at last, I never gave it over; and though I 
was near two years about it, yet I never grudged my 
labour, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea 
at last. 

However, though my little periagua was finished, 
yet the size of it was not at all answerable to the 
design which I had in view when I made the first; I 
mean, of venturing over to the terra firma , where it 
was about forty miles broad. Accordingly, the small- 
ness of my boat assisted to put an end to that design, 
and now I thought no more of it. But as I had a boat, 
my next design was to make a tour round the island ; 
for as I had been on the other side in one place, crossing, 
as I have already described it, over the land, so the 
discoveries I made in that little journey made me very 
eager to see other parts of the coast ; and now I had 
a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the island. 

For this purpose, that I might do everything with 
discretion and consideration, I fitted up a little mast 
to my boat, and made a sail to it out of some of the 
pieces of the ship’s sail, Which lay in store, and of 
which I had a great stock by me. 

Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, 
I found she would sail very well. Then I made little 
lockers, or boxes, at either end of my boat, to put 
provisions, necessaries, and ammunition, etc., into, to 
be kept dry, either from rain or the spray of the sea; 
and a little long hollow place I cut in the inside of the 
boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang 
down over it to keep it dry. 

I fixed m y umbrella also in a step at the stem, like 
a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the heat of 
the sun off of me, like an awning; and thus I every 



104 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

now and then took a little voyage upon the sea, but 
never went far out, not far from the little creek. But 
at last, being eager to view the circumference of my 
little kingdom, I resolved upon my tour; and accord- 
ingly I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting in 
two dozen of my loaves (cakes I should rather call 
them) of barley bread, an earthen pot full of parched 
rice, a food I eat a great deal of, a little bottle of rum, 
half a goat, and powder and shot for killing more, 
and two large watch-coats, of those which, as I men- 
tioned before, I had saved out of the seamen’s chests; 
these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover 
me in the night. 

It was the 6 th of November, in the sixth year of 
my reign, or my captivity, which you please, that I 
set out on this voyage, and I found it much longer 
than I expected ; for though the island itself was not 
very large, yet when I came to the east side of it I 
found a great ledge of rocks lie out above two leagues 
into the sea, some above water, some under it, and 
beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league 
more; so that I was obliged to go a great way out to 
sea to double the point. 

When first I discovered them, I was going to give 
over my enterprise and come back again, not knowing 
how far it might oblige me to go out to sea, and, 
above all, doubting how I should get back again, so 
I came to an anchor; for I had made me a kind of an 
anchor with a piece of a broken grappling which I 
got out of the ship. 

Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went 
on shore, climbing up upon a hill, which .seemed to 
overlook that point, where I saw the full extent of it, 
and resolved to venture. 



THE BOAT 105 

In my viewing the sea from that hill, where I stood, 
I perceived a strong, and indeed a most furious current, 
which run to the east, and even came close to the 
point; and I took the more notice of it, because I 
saw there might be some danger that when I came into 
it I might be carried out to sea by the strength of it, 
and not be able to make the island again. And indeed, 
had I not gotten first up upon this hill, I believe it 
would have been so; for there was the same current 
on the other side the island, only that it set off at a 
farther distance; and I saw there was a strong eddy 
under the shore; so I had nothing to do but to get 
in out of the first current, and I should presently be 
in an eddy. 

I lay here, however, two days; because the wind, 
blowing pretty fresh at E.S.E., and that being just 
contrary to the said current, made a great breach of 
the sea upon the point ; so that it was not safe for me 
to keep too close to the shore for the breach, nor to 
go too far off because of the stream. 

The third day, in the morning, the wind having 
abated overnight, the sea *was calm, and I ventured. 
But I am a warning piece again to all rash and ignorant 
pilots; for no sooner was I come to the point, when 
even I was not my boat's length from the shore, but 
I found myself in a great depth of water, and a current 
like the sluice of a mill. It carried my boat along with 
it with such violence, that all I could do could not 
keep her so much as on the edge of it, but I found it 
hurried me farther and' farther out from the eddy, 
which was on my left hand. There was no wind stirring 
to help me,, and all I could do with my paddlers signi- 
fied nothing. And now I began to give myself over 
for lost; for as the current was on both sides the 

*D 



io6 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

island, I knew in a few leagues' distance they must 
join again, and then I was irrecoverably gone. Nor 
did I see any possibility of avoiding it ; so that I had 
no prospect before me but of perishing; not by the 
sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving for 
hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the shore, 
as big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it into the 
boat; and I had a great jar of fresh water, that is to 
say, one of my earthen pots; but what was all this to 
being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be sure, 
there was no shore, no mainland or island, for a 
thousand leagues at least. 

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence 
of God to make the most miserable condition mankind 
could be in worse. Now I looked back upon my 
desolate solitary island as the most pleasant place in 
the world, and all the happiness my heart could wish 
for was to be but there again. However, I worked 
hard, till indeed my strength was almost exhausted, 
and kept my boat as much to the northward, that is, 
towards the side of the current which the eddy lay 
on, as possibly I could; when about noon, as the sun 
passed the meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze 
of wind in my face, springing up from the S.S.E. 
This cheered my heart a little, and especially when, 
in about half-an-hour more, it blew a pretty small 
gentle gale. By this time I was gotten at a frightful 
distance from the island; and had the least cloud or 
hazy weather intervened, I had been undone another 
way too; for I had no compass on board, and should 
never have known how to have steered towards the 
island if I had but once lost sight of it. But the 
weather continuing clear, I applied myself to get up 
my mast again, and spread my sail, standing away 



THE BOAT 107 

to the north as much as possible, to get out of the 
current, north-west ; and in about an hour came within 
about a mile of the shore, where, it being smooth water, 
I soon got to land. 

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave 
God thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside 
all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat; and re- 
freshing myself with such things as I had, I brought 
my boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had 
spied under some trees, and laid me down to sleep, 
being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the 
voyage. 

I was now at a great loss which way to get home 
with my boat. I had run so much hazard, and knew 
too much the case, to think of attempting it by the 
way I went out; and what might be at the other 
side (I mean the west side) I knew not, nor had I any 
mind to run any more ventures. So I only resolved 
in the morning to make my way westward along the 
shore, and to see if there was no creek where I might 
lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again 
if I wanted her. In about'three miles, or thereabouts, 
coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay, 
about a mile over, which narrowed till it came to a 
very little rivulet or brook, where I found a very con- 
venient harbour for my boat, and where she lay as if 
she had been in a little dock made on purpose for her. 
Here I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, 
I went on shore to look about me, and see where I was. 

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place 
where I had been before, when I travelled on foot to 
that shore > so taking nothing out of my boat but my 
gun and my umbrella, for it was exceedingly hot, I 
began my march. The way was comfortable enough 



io8 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

after such a voyage as I had been upon, and I reached 
my old bower in the evening, where I found everything 
standing as I left it ; for I always kept it in good order, 
being, as I said before, my country house. 

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade 
to rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep. 
But judge you, if you can, that read my story, what 
a surprise I must be in, when I was waked out of my 
sleep by a voice calling me by my name several times, 
“Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe! 
Where are you, Robin Crusoe ? Where . are you ? 
Where have you been? ” 

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with 
rowing, or paddling, as it is called, the first part of 
the day, and with walking the latter part, that I did 
not wake thoroughly; but dozing between sleeping 
and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke 
to me. But as the voice continued to repeat “ Robin 
Crusoe, Robin Crusoe/' at last I began to wake more 
perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frighted, and 
started up in the utmost consternation. But no sooner 
were my eyes open, but I Saw my Poll sitting on the 
top of the hedge, and immediately knew that it was 
he that spoke to me; for just in such bemoaning lan- 
guage I had used to talk to him, and teach him; and 
he had learned it so perfectly, that he would sit upon 
my finger, and -lay Jus bill close to my face, and cry, 
" Poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you? Where have 
you been? How come you here? ” and such things 
as I had taught him. 

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, 
and that indeed it could be nobody else, it was a 
good while before I could compose myself. First, I was 
amazed how the creature got thither, and then, how 



THE BOAT 109 

he should just keep about the place, and nowhere else. 
But as I was well satisfied it could be nobody but 
honest Poll, I got it over; and holding out my hand, 
and calling him by his name, Poll, the sociable creature 
came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to 
do, and continued talking to me, " Poor Robin Crusoe! 
and how did I come here? and where had I been? ” 
just as if he had been overjoyed to see me again; and 
so I carried him home along with me. 

I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some 
time, and had enough to do for many days to sit 
still, and reflect upon the danger I had been in. I 
would have been very glad to have had my boat again 
on my side of the island; but I knew not how it was 
practicable to get it about. As to the east side of the 
island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough 
there was no venturing that way; my very heart 
would shrink, and my very blood run chill, but to 
think of it. And as to the other side of the island, I 
did not know how it might be there; but supposing 
the current ran with the same force against the shore 
at the east as it passed by it on the other, I might 
run the same risk of being driven down the stream, 
and carried by the island, as I had been before of 
being carried away from it. So, with these thoughts, 
I contented myself to be without any boat, though it 
had been the product of so many months’ labour to 
make it, and of so many more to get it unto the sea.

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


CHAPTER X 

THE DAILY TASK 

In this government of my temper I remained near 
a year, lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may 
well suppose; and my thoughts being very much 
composed as to my condition, and fully comforted in 
resigning myself to the dispositions of Providence, I 
thought I lived really very happily in all things, except 
that of society. 

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic 
exercises which my necessities put me upon applying 
myself to, and I believe could, upon occasion, make 
a very good carpenter, especially considering how few 
tools I had. Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected 
perfection in my earthenware, and contrived well 
enough to make them with a wheel, which I found 
infinitely easier and better, because I made things 
round and shapable which before were filthy things 
indeed to look on. But I think I was never more vain 
of my own performance, or more joyful for anything 
I found out, than for my being able to make a tobacco- 
pipe. And though it was a very ugly clumsy thing 
when it was done, and only burnt red, like other 
earthenware, yet as it was hard and firm, and would 
draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with 
it; for I had been always used to smoke, and there 
were pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not 
knowing that there was tobacco in the island; and 
afterwards, when I searched the ship again, I could 
not come at any pipes at all. 

In my wicker-ware also I improved much, and made 
abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my inven- 



THE DAILY TASK 


hi 


tion showed me; though not very handsome, yet 
they were such as were very handy and convenient 
for my laying things up in, or fetching things home 
in. For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could 
hang it up in a tree, flay it, and dress it, and cut it 
in pieces, and bring it home in a' basket; and the like 
by a turtle; I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and 
a piece or two of the flesh, which was enough for me, 
and bring them home in a basket, and leave the rest 
behind me. Also large deep baskets were my receivers 
for my com, which I always rubbed out as soon as it 
was dry, and cured, and kept it in great baskets. 

I began now to perceive my powder abated con- 
siderably, and this was a want which it was impossible 
for me to supply, and I began seriously to consider 
what I must do when I should have no more powder; 
that is to say, how I should do to kill any goats. I 
had, as is observed, in the third year of my being here 
kept a young kid, and bred her up tame. I could 
never find in my heart to kill her, till she died at last 
of mere age. 

But being now in the eleVenth year of my residence, 
and, as I have said, my ammunition growing low, I set 
myself to study some art to trap and snare the goats, 
to see whether I could not catch some of them alive. 

To this purpose, I made snares to hamper them, 
and I do believe they were more than once taken in 
them; but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, 
and I always found them broken, and my bait de- 
voured. At length I resolved to try a pitfall; so I 
dug several large pits in the earth, in places where 
I had observed the goats used to feed, and over these 
pits I placed hurdles, of my own making too, with a 
great weight upon them ; and several times I put ears 



ii2 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

of barley and dry rice, without setting the trap, and 
I could easily perceive that the goats had gone in and 
eaten up the com, for I could see the mark of their 
feet. At length I set three traps in one night, and 
going the next morning, I found them all standing, 
and yet the bait eaten and gone; this was very dis- 
couraging. However, I altered my trap; and, not to 
trouble you with particulars, going one morning to 
see my trap, I found in one of them a large old he-goat, 
and in one of the other three kids. 

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him, 
he was so fierce I durst not go into the pit to him; 
that is to say, to go about to bring him away alive, 
which was what I wanted. So I even let him out, 
and he ran away, as if he had been frighted out of his 
wits. But I had forgot then what I learned afterwards, 
that hunger will tame a lion. If I had let him stay 
there three or four days without food, and then have 
carried him some water to drink, and then a little 
com, he would have been as tame as one of the kids, 
for they are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures 
where they are well used. 

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no 
better at that time. Then I went to the three kids, 
and taking them one by one, I tied them with strings 
together, and with some difficulty brought them all 
home. 

It was a good while before they would feed, but 
throwing them some sweet com, it tempted them, 
and they began to be tame. And now I found that 
if I expected to supply myself with goat-flesh when 
I had no powder or shot left, breeding some up tame 
was my only way, when perhaps I might have them 
about my house like a flock of sheep. 



THE DAILY TASK 113 

But then it presently occurred to me that I must 
keep the tame from the wild, or else they would always 
run wild when they grew up; and the only way for 
this was to have some enclosed piece of ground, well 
fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep them in so 
effectually, that those within might not break out, or 
those without break in. 

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands ; 
yet as I saw there was an absolute necessity of doing 
it, my first piece of work was to find out a proper 
piece of ground, viz., where there was likely to be 
herbage for them to eat, water for them to drink, and 
cover to keep them from the sun. 

For the first beginning, I resolved to enclose a piece 
of about 150 yards in length, and 100 yards in breadth; 
which, as it would maintain as many as I should have 
in any reasonable time, so, as my flock increased, I 
could add more ground to my enclosure. 

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to 
work with courage. I was about three months hedging 
in the first piece, and, till I had done it, I tethered 
the three kids in the best part of it, and used them 
to feed as near me as possible, to make them familiar; 
and very often I would go and carry them some ears 
of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them out of 
my hand; so that after my enclosure was finished, 
and I let them loose, they would follow me up and 
down, bleating after me for a handful of com. 

This answered my end, and in about a year and 
half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids, and 
all; and in two years more I had three and forty, 
besides several that I took and killed for my food. 
And after that I enclosed five several pieces of ground 
to feed them in, with little pens to drive them into. 



H4 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

to take them as I wanted, and gates out of one piece 
of ground into another. 

But this was not all, for now I not only had goat’s 
flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk too, a thing 
which, indeed, in my beginning, I did not so much 
as think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts, 
was really an agreeable surprise. For now I set up my 
dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk in 
a day; and as Nature, who gives supplies of food to 
every creature, dictates even naturally how to make 
use of it, so I, that had never milked a cow, much less 
a goat, or seen butter or cheese made, very readily 
and handily, though after a great many essays and 
miscarriages, made me both butter and cheese at last, 
and never wanted it afterwards. 

It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen me 
and my little family sit down to dinner. There was 
my majesty, the prince and lord of the whole island; 
I had the lives of all my subjects at my absolute 
command. I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take 
it away; and no rebels among all my subjects. 

Then to see how like a kfng I dined, too, all alone, 
attended by my servants. Poll, as if he had been my 
favourite, was the only person permitted to talk to 
me. My dog, who was now grown very old and crazy, 
sat always at my right hand, and two cats, one on one 
side the table, and one on the other, expecting now and 
then a bit from my hand, as a mark of special favour. 

With this attendance, and in this plentiful manner, 
I lived ; neither could I be said to want anything but 
society; and of that in some time after this, I was 
like to have too much. • 

I was something impatient, as I have observed, to 
have the use of my boat, though very loth to run any 



THE DAILY TASK 115 

more hazards; and therefore sometimes I sat con- 
triving ways to get her about the island, and at other 
times I sat myself down contented enough without 
her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my mind to 
go down to the point of the island where, as I have 
said, in my last ramble, I went up the hill to see how 
the shore lay, and how the current set, that I might 
see what I had to do. This inclination increased upon 
me every day, and at length I resolved to travel 
thither by land, following the edge of the shore. I did 
so; but had anyone in England been to meet such a 
man as I was, it must either have frightened them, 
or raised a great deal of laughter; and as I frequently 
stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at 
the notion of my travelling through Yorkshire, with 
such an equipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased to 
take a sketch of my figure, as follows. 

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat's 
skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep 
the sun from me, as to shoot the rain off from running 
into my neck; nothing being so hurtful in these 
climates as the rain upon -the flesh, under the clothes. 

I had a short jacket of goat-skin, the skirts coming 
down to about the middle of my thighs; and a pair 
of open-kneed breeches of the same. The breeches 
were made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair 
hung down such a length on either side, that, like 
pantaloons, it reached to the middle of my legs. 
Stockings and shoes I had none, but had made me a 
pair of somethings, I scarce know what to call them, 
like buskins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either 
side like spatterdashes; but of a most barbarous 
shape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes. 

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried which 



Ii6 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

I drew together with two thongs of the same, instead 
of buckles; and in a kind of a frog on either side of 
this, instead of a sword and a dagger, hung a little 
saw and a hatchet, one on one side, one on the other. 
I had another belt, not so broad, and fastened in the 
same manner, which hung over my shoulder; and at 
the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, 
both made of goat's skin too; in one of which hung 
my powder, in the other my shot. At my back I carried 
my basket, on my shoulder my gun, and over my 
head a great clumsy ugly goat-skin umbrella, but 
which, after all, was the most necessary thing I had 
about me, next to my gun. As for my face, the colour 
of it was really not so mulatto-like as one might 
expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living 
within nineteen degrees of the equinox. My beard I 
had once suffered to grow till it was about a quarter 
of a yard long; but as I had both scissors and razors 
sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what grew 
on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large 
pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had seen worn 
by some Turks whom I saw at Sallee; for the Moors 
did not wear such, though the Turks did. Of these 
mustachios or whiskers, I will not say they were long 
enough to hang my hat upon them, but they were of 
a length and shape monstrous enough, and such as, in 
England, would haye passed for frightful. 

But all this is by-the-bye; for, as to my figure, I 
had so few to observe me, that it was of no manner 
of consequence; so I say no more to that part. In 
this kind of figure I went my new journey, and was 
out five or six days. I travelled first along the sea- 
shore, directly to the place where I first brought my 
boat to an anchor, to get up upon the rocks. And 



THE DAILY TASK n 7 

having no boat now to take care of, I went over the 
land, a nearer way, to the same height that I was upon 
before; when, looking forward to the point of the 
rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to double 
with my boat, as is said above, I was surprised to see 
the sea all smooth and quiet, no rippling, no motion, 
no current, any more there than in other places. 

I was at a strange loss to understand this, and 
resolved to spend some time in the observing it, to see 
if nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned it. 

My observation convinced me that I had nothing 
to do but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of 
the tide, and I might very easily bring my boat about 
the island again. But when I began to think of putting 
it in practice, I had such a terror upon my spirits at 
the remembrance of the danger I had been in, that 
I could not think of it again with any patience; but, 
on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which 
was more safe, though more laborious; and this was 
that I would build, or rather make me another periagua 
or canoe; and so have one for one side of the island, 
and one for the other. 

You are to understand that now I had, as I may 
call it, two plantations in the island; one, my little 
fortification or tent, with the wall about it, under the 
rock, with the cave behind me, which, by this time, 
I had enlarged into several apartments or caves, one 
within another. One of these which was the driest 
and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall of 
fortification, that is to say, beyond where my wall 
joined to the rock, was all filled up with the large 
earthen pots, of which I have given an account, and 
with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would 
hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my stores 



n8 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

of provision, especially my com, some in the ear, cut 
off short from the straw, and the other rubbed out 
with my hand. 

As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes 
or piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were by 
this time grown so big, and spread so very much, 
that there was not the least appearance, to any one's 
view, of any habitation behind them. 

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little further 
within the land, and upon lower ground, lay my two 
pieces of com ground, which I kept duly cultivated 
and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest 
in its season; and whenever I had occasion for more 
com, I had more land adjoining as fit as that. 

Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had now 
a tolerable plantation there also; for, first, I had my 
little bower, as I called it, which I kept in repair; 
that is to say, I kept the hedge which circled it in 
constantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder 
standing always in the inside. I kept the trees, which 
at first were no more than my stakes, but were now 
grown very firm and tall, T kept them always so cut, 
that they might spread and grow thick and wild, and 
make the more agreeable shade, which they did effec- 
tually to my mind. In the middle of this, I had my 
tent always standing, being a piece of sail spread over 
poles, set up for that purpose, and which never wanted 
any repair or renewing; and under this I had made 
me a squab or couch, with the skins of the creatures 
I had killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket 
laid on them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, 
which I had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover 
me; and here, whenever I had occasion to be absent 
from my chief seat, I took up my country habitation. 



THE DAILY TASK 119 

Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, 
that is to say, my goats. And as I had taken an incon- 
ceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose this ground, 
so I was so uneasy to see it kept entire, lest the goats 
should break through, that I never left off till, with in- 
finite labour, I had stuck the outside of the hedge so 
full of small stakes, and so near to one another, that 
it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce 
room to put a hand through between them; which 
afterwards, when those stakes grew, as they all did 
in the next rainy season, made the enclosure strong 
like a wall, indeed, stronger than any wall. 

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that 
I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared 
necessary for my comfortable support; for I con- 
sidered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus 
at my hand would be a living magazine of flesh, milk, 
butter, and cheese for me as long as I lived in the 
place, if it were to be forty years; and that keeping 
them in my reach depended entirely upon my per- 
fecting my enclosures to such a degree, that I might 
be sure of keeping them together, which, by this 
method, indeed, I so effectually secured, that when 
these little stakes began to grow, I had planted them so 
very thick, I was forced to pull some of them up again. 

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which 
I principally depended on for my winter store of 
raisins, and which I never failed to preserve carefully, 
as the best and most agreeable dainty of my whole 
diet. And indeed they were not agreeable only, but 
physical, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to 
the last degree. 

As this was also about half-way between my other 
habitation and the place where I had laid up my 



120 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

boat, I generally stayed and lay here in my way 
thither; for I used frequently to visit my boat, and 
I kept all things about, or belonging to her, in very 
good order. Sometimes I went out in her to divert 
myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go, 
not scarce ever above a stone's cast or two from the 
shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurried out of 
my knowledge again by the currents or winds, or any 
other accident. But now I come to a new scene of 
my life. 


CHAPTER XI 

THE FOOTPRINT 

It happened one day, about noon, going towards 
my boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the print 
of a man's naked foot on the shore, which was very 
plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like one thunder- 
struck, or as if I had seen an apparition. I listened, 
I looked round me, I could hear nothing, nor see 
anything. I went up to a rising ground, to look farther. 
I went up the shore, and down the shore, but it was 
all one ; I could see no other impression but that one. 
I went to it again to see if there were any more, and 
to observe if it might not be my fancy; but there 
was no room for tl\at, for there was exactly the very 
print of a foot — toes, heel, and every part of a foot. 
How it came thither I knew not, nor could in the least 
imagine. But after innumerable fluttering thoughts, 
like a man perfectly confused and out of myself, I 
came home to my fortification, not feeling,, as we say, 
the ground I went on, but terrified to the last degree, 
looking behind me at every two or three steps, 



THE FOOTPRINT 121 

mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying every 
stump at a distance to be a man; nor is it possible 
to describe how many various shapes affrighted 
imagination represented things to me in, how many 
wild ideas were found every moment in my fancy, 
and what strange unaccountable whimsies came into 
my thoughts, by the way. 

When I came to my castle, for so I think I called 
it ever after this, I fled into it like one pursued. 
Whether I went over by the ladder, as first contrived, 
or went in at the hole in the rock, which I called a 
door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember 
the next morning, for never frighted hare fled to cover, 
or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than I to 
this retreat. 

I slept none that night. The farther I was from the 
occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehensions 
were; which is something contrary to the nature of 
such things, and especially to the usual practice of 
all creatures in fear. But I was so embarrassed with 
my own frightful ideas of the thing, that I formed 
nothing but dismal imaginations to myself, even though 
I was now a great way off it. Sometimes I fancied it 
must be the devil, and reason joined in with me upon 
this supposition; for how should any other thing in 
human shape come into the place? Where was the 
vessel that brought them? What marks was there of 
any other footsteps ? And how was it possible a man 
should come there? But then to think that Satan 
should take human shape upon him in such a place, 
where there could be no manner of occasion for it, 
but to leavfc the print of his foot behind him, and that 
even for no purpose too, for he could not be sure I 
should see it ; this was an amusement the other way. 



122 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

I considered that the devil might have found out 
abundance of other ways to have terrified me than 
this of the single print of a foot; that as I live quite 
on the other side of the island, he would never have 
been so simple to leave a mark in a place where it was 
ten thousand to one whether I should ever see it or 
not, and in the sand too, which the first surge of the 
sea, upon a high wind, would have defaced entirely. 
All this seemed inconsistent with the thing itself, and 
with all the notions we usually entertain of the subtilty 
of the devil. 

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue 
me out of all apprehensions of its being the devil; 
and I presently concluded then, that it must be some 
more dangerous creature, viz., that it must be some 
of the savages of the mainland over against me, who 
had wandered out to sea in their canoes, and, either 
driven by the currents or by contrary winds, had made 
the island, and had been on shore, but were gone away 
again to sea, being as loth, perhaps, to have stayed in 
this desolate island as I would have been to have had 
them. 

While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, 
I was very thankful in my thoughts that I was so 
happy as not to be thereabouts at that time, or that 
they did not see my boat, by which they would have 
concluded that some inhabitants had been in the 
place, and perhaps have searched farther for me. 
Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about 
their having found my boat, and that there were 
people here; and that if so, I should certainly have 
them come in greater numbers, and devour me ; that 
if it should happen so that they should not find me, 
yet they would find my enclosure, destroy all my 



THE FOOTPRINT 123 

corn, carry away all my flock of tame goats, and I 
should perish at last for mere want. 

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope. All 
that former confidence in God, which was founded 
upon such wonderful experience as I had had of His 
goodness, now vanished, as if He that had fed me by 
miracle hitherto could not preserve, by His power, the 
provision which He had made for me by His goodness. 
I reproached myself with my easiness, that would not 
sow any more com one year than would just serve 
me till the next season, as if no accident could inter- 
vene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon 
the ground. And this I thought so just a reproof, 
that I resolved for the future to have two or three 
years’ com beforehand, so that, whatever might come, 
I might not perish for want of bread. 

I then reflected that God, who was not only right- 
eous, but omnipotent, as He had thought fit thus 
to punish and afflict me, so He was able to deliver 
me; that if He did not think fit to do it, ’twas my 
unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and 
entirely to His will; and, on the other hand, it was my 
duty also to hope in Him, pray to Him, and quietly 
to attend the dictates and directions of His daily 
providence. 

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, 
I may say, weeks and months; and one particular 
effect of my cogitations on this occasion I cannot 
omit, viz., one morning early, lying in my bed, and 
filled with thought about my danger from the appear- 
ance of savages, I found it discomposed me very much; 
upon which those words of the Scripture came into my 
thoughts, “ Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I 
will deliver, and thou shalt glorify Me.” 



124 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, 
and reflections, it came into my thought one day, 
that all this might be a mere chimera of my own; 
and that this foot might be the print of my own foot, 
when I came on shore from my boat. This cheered 
me up a little too, and I began to persuade myself 
it was all a delusion, that it was nothing else but my 
own foot; and why might not I come that way from 
the boat, as well as I was going that way to the boat ? 
Again, I considered also, that I could by no means 
tell, for certain, where I had trod, and where I had 
not; and that if, at last, this was only the print of 
my own foot, I had played the part of those fools 
who strive to make stories of spectres and apparitions, 
and then are frighted at them more than anybody. 

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad 
again, for I had not stirred out of my castle for three 
days and nights, so that I began to starve for pro- 
vision; for I had little or nothing within doors but 
some barley-cakes and water. Then I knew that my 
goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was my 
evening diversion ; and the poor creatures were in great 
pain and inconvenience for want of it; and, indeed, 
it almost spoiled some of them, and almost dried up 
their milk. 

Heartening myself, therefore, with the belief that 
this was nothing but the print of one of my own feet, 
and so I might be truly said to start at my own shadow, 
I began to go abroad again, and went to my country 
house to milk my flock. But to see with what fear I 
went forward, how often I looked behind me, how 
I was ready, every now and then, to lay down my 
basket, and run for my life, it would have made 
any one have thought I was haunted with an evil 



THE FOOTPRINT 125 

conscience, or that I had been lately most terribly 
frighted; and so, indeed, I had. 

However, as I went down thus two or three days, 
and having seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, 
and to think there was really nothing in it but my 
own imagination. But I could not persuade myself 
fully of this till I should go down to the shore again, 
and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my 
own, and see if there was any similitude or fitness, 
that I might be assured it was my own foot. But 
when I came to the place, first, it appeared evidently 
to me, that when I laid up my boat, I could not 
possibly be on shore anywhere thereabout; secondly, 
when I came to measure the mark with my own foot, 
I found my foot not so large by a great deal. Both 
these things filled my head with new imaginations, 
and gave me the vapours again to the highest degree ; 
so that I shook with cold, like one in an ague; and 
I went home again, filled with the belief that some 
man or men had been on shore there; or, in short, 
that the island was inhabited, and I might be sur- 
prised before I was aware. And what course to take 
for my security, I knew not. 

The confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all 
night, but in the morning I fell asleep; and having, 
by the amusement of my mind, been, as it were, tired, 
and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and 
waked much better composed than I had ever been 
before. And now I began to think sedately; and upon 
the utmost debate with myself, I concluded that this 
island, which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and 
no farther from the mainland than as I had seen, was 
not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine; that 
although there were no stated inhabitants who lived 



126 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

on the spot, yet that there might sometimes come 
boats off from the shore, who, either with design, or 
perhaps never but when they were driven by cross 
winds, might come to this place; that I had lived 
here fifteen years now, and had not met with the 
least shadow or figure of any people yet; and that 
if at any time they should be driven here, it was 
probable they went away again as soon as ever they 
could, seeing they had never thought fit to fix there 
upon any occasion to this time; that the most I could 
suggest any danger from, was from any such casual 
accidental landing of straggling people from the main, 
who, as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were 
here against their wills; so they made no stay here, 
but went off again with all possible speed, seldom 
staying one night on shore, lest they should not have 
the help of the tides and daylight back again; and 
that, therefore, I had nothing to do but to consider 
of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages 
land upon the spot. 

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my 
cave so large as to bring a door through again, which 
door, as I said, came out beyond where my fortification 
joined to the rock. Upon maturely considering this, 
therefore, I resolved to draw me a second fortification, 
in the same manner of a semicircle, at a distance from 
my wall, just where I had planted a double row of 
trees about twelve years before, of which I made 
mention. These trees having been planted so thick 
before, they wanted but a few piles to be driven 
between them, that they should be thicker and stronger, 
and my wall would be soon finished. 

So that I had now a double wall; and my outer 
wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, 



THE FOOTPRINT 127 

and everything I could think of, to make it strong, 
having in it seven little holes, about as big as I might 
put my arm out at. In the inside of this I thickened 
my wall to above ten feet thick with continual bringing 
earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the 
wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven 
holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I 
took notice that I got seven on shore out of the ship. 
These, I say, I planted like my cannon, and fitted 
them into frames, that held them like a carriage, that 
so I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes' time. 
This wall I was many a weary month a-finishing, and 
yet never thought myself safe till it was done. 

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without 
my wall, for a great way every way, as full with 
stakes, or sticks, of the osier-like wood, which I found 
so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch, 
that I believe I migjit set in near twenty thousand of 
them, leaving a pretty large space between them and 
my wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, 
and they might have no shelter from the young trees, 
if they attempted to approach my outer-wall. 

Thus in two years' time I had a thick grove; and 
in five or six years' time I had a wood before my 
dwelling, growing so monstrous thick and strong, that 
it was indeed perfectly impassable; and no men, of 
what kind soever, would ever imagaine that there was 
any thing beyond it, much less a habitation. As for 
the way which I proposed to myself to go in and out, 
for I left no avenue, it was by setting two ladders, 
one to a part of the rock which was low, and then 
broke in, and left room to place; another ladder upon 
that; so when the two ladders were taken down, no 
man living could come down to me without mischieving 



128 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

himself; and if they had come down, they were still 
on the outside of my outer wall. 

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could 
suggest for my own preservation ; and it will be seen, 
at length, that they were not altogether without just 
reason; though I foresaw nothing at that time more 
than my mere fear suggested to me. 

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless 
of my other affairs; for I had a great concern upon 
me for my little herd of goats. They were not only a 
present supply to me upon every occasion, and began 
to be sufficient to me, without the expense of powder 
and shot, but also without the fatigue of hunting after 
the wild ones; and I was loth to lose the advantage 
of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again 

To this purpose, after long consideration, I could 
think of but two ways to preserve them. One was, 
to find another convenient placebo dig a cave under 
ground, and to drive them into it every night; and 
the other was, to enclose two or three little bits of 
land, remote from one another, and as much concealed 
as I could, where I might keep about half-a-dozen 
young goats in each place; so that if any disaster 
happened to the flock in general, I might be able to 
raise them again with little trouble and time. And 
this, though it would require a great deal of time and 
labour, I thought' was the most rational design. 

Accordingly I spent some time to find out the most 
retired parts of the island; and I pitched upon one 
which was as private indeed as my heart could wish 
for. It was a little damp piece of ground in the middle 
of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, 
I almost lost myself once before, endeavouring to come 
back that way from the eastern part of the island. 



THE FOOTPRINT 129 

Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres, 
so surrounded with woods, that it was almost an 
enclosure by Nature; at least, it did not want near 
so much labour to make it so as the other pieces of 
ground I had worked so hard at. 

I immediately went to work with this piece of 
ground, and in less than a month's time I had so 
fenced it round that my flock, or herd, call it which 
you please, who were not so wild now as at first they 
might be supposed to be, were well enough secured 
in it. So, without any farther delay, I removed ten 
young she-goats and two he-goats to this piece. And 
when they were there, I continued to perfect the 
fence, till I had made it as secure as the other, which, 
however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up 
more time by a great deal. 

All this labour I was at the expense of, purely from 
my apprehensions on the account of the print of a 
man's foot which I had seen ; for, as yet, I never saw 
any human creature come near the island. And I had 
now lived two years under these uneasinesses, which, 
indeed, made my life much less comfortable than it 
was before, as may well be imagined by any who 
know what it is to live in the constant snare of the 
fear of man. And this I must observe, with §rief too, 
that the discomposure of my mind had too great im- 
pressions also upon the religious part of my thoughts; 
for the dread and terror of falling into the hands of 
savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I 
seldom found myself in a due temper for application 
to my Maker, at least not with the sedate calmness 
and resignation of soul which I was wont to do. 

But to go on. After I had thus secured one part 
of my little living stock, I went about the whole 
1 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


130 

island, searching for another private place to make 
such another deposit; when, wandering more to the 
west point of the island than I had ever done yet , 
and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon 
the sea, at a great distance. I had found a prospective 
glass or two in one of the seamen’s chests, which I 
saved out of our ship, but I had it not about me; and 
this was so remote, that I could not tell what to make 
of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able 
to hold to look any longer. Whether it was a boat 
or not, I do not know; but as I descended from the 
hill, I could see no more of it, so I gave it over; only 
I resolved to go no more out without a prospective 
glass in my pocket. 

When I was come down the hill to the end of the 
island, where, indeed, I had never been before, I was 
presently convinced that the seeing the print of a 
man’s foot was not such a strange thing in the island 
as I imagined. And, but that it was a special provi- 
dence that I was cast upon the side of the island 
where the savages never came, I should easily have 
known that nothing was more frequent than for the 
canoes from the main, when they happened to be a 
little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of 
the island for harbour; likewise, as they often met 
and fought in their canoes, the victors having taken 
any prisoners would bring them over to this shore, 
where, according to their dreadful customs, being all 
cannibals, they would kill and eat them; of which 
hereafter. 

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I 
said above, being the S.W. point of the island, I was 
perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible 
for me to express the horror of my mind at seeing 



THE FOOTPRINT 131 

the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other 
bones of human bodies; and particularly, I observed 
a place where there had been a fire made, and a circle 
dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where it is supposed 
the savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman 
feastings upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures. 

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, 
that I entertained no notion of any danger to myself 
from it for a long while. All my apprehensions were 
buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, 
hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of 
human nature, which, though I had heard of often, 
yet I never had so near a view of before. In short, 
I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle. I 
got me up the hill again with all the speed I could, 
and walked on towards my own habitation. 

When I came a little out of that part of the island, 
I stood still a while, as amazed; and then recovering 
myself, I looked up with the utmost affection of my 
soul, and with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God 
thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the 
world where I was distinguished from such dreadful 
creatures as these. 

In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my 
castle, and began to be much easier now, as to the 
safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before; 
for I observed that these wretches never came to this 
island in search of what they could get; perhaps not 
seeking, not wanting, or not expecting, anything here; 
and having often, no doubt, been up in the covered, 
woody part of it, without finding anything to their 
purpose. I knew I had been here now almost eighteen 
years, and never saw the least footsteps of human 
creature there before; and I might be here eighteen 



132 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

more as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not 
discover myself to them, which I had no manner of 
occasion to do; it being my only business to keep 
myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I found 
a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make 
myself known to. 

Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage 
wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the 
wretched inhuman custom of their devouring and eating 
one another up, that I continued pensive and sad, and 
continued close within my own circle for almost two 
years after this. When I say my own circle, I mean 
by it my three plantations, viz., my castle, my country 
seat, which I called my bower, and my enclosure in 
the woods. Nor did I look after this for any other use 
than as an enclosure for my goats; for the aversion 
which Nature gave me to these hellish wretches was 
such, that I was fearful of seeing them as of seeing 
the devil himself. 

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I 
was in no danger of being discovered by these people, 
began to wear off my uneasiness about them; and I 
began to live just in the same composed manner as 
before; only with this difference, that I used more 
caution, and kept my eyes more about me, than 
I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any 
of them; and particularly, I was more cautious of 
firing my gun, lest any of them being on the island 
should happen to hear of it. And it was, therefore, 
a very good providence to me that I had furnished 
myself with a tame breed of goats, that I needed not 
hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them. 
And if I did catch any of them after this, it was by 
traps and snares, as I had done before; so that for 



FEAR OF SAVAGES 133 

two years after this I believe I never fired my gun 
once off, though I never went out without it; and, 
which was more, as I had saved three pistols out of 
the ship, I always carried them out with me, or at least 
two of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt. Also 
I furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I had 
out of the ship, and made me a belt to put it on also ; 
so that I was now a most formidable fellow to look at 
when I went abroad, if you add to the former descrip- 
tion of myself the particular of two pistols and a great 
broadsword hanging at my side in a belt, but without 
a scabbard. 

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, 
I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to 
my former calm, sedate way of living. All these 
things tended to showing me, more and more, how far 
my condition was from being miserable, compared to 
some others; nay, to many other particulars of life, 
which it might have pleased God to have made my 
lot. It put me upon reflecting how little repining there 
would be among mankind at any condition of life, if 
people would rather compare their condition with those 
that are worse, in order to be thankful, than be always 
comparing them with those which are better, to assist 
their murmurings and complainings. 

CHAPTER XII 
FEAR OF SAVAGES 

As in my present condition there were not really 
many things which I wanted, so indeed I thought that 
the frights I had been in about these savage wretches, 
and the concern I had been in for my own preservation, 



134 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

had taken off the edge of my invention for my own 
conveniences. And I had dropped a good design, 
which 1 had once bent my thoughts too much upon; 
and that was, to try if I could not make some of my 
barle)' into malt, and then try to brew myself some 
beer. 

But my invention now run quite another way; for, 
night and day, I could think of nothing but how I 
might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel, 
bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the victim 
they should bring hither to destroy. It would take 
up a larger volume than this whole work is intended 
to be, to set down all the contrivances I hatched, oi 
rather brooded upon, in my thought, for the destroying 
these creatures, or at least frighting them so as to 
prevent their coming hither any more. But all was 
abortive; nothing could be possible to take effect, 
unless I was to be there to do it myself. And what 
could one man do among them, when perhaps there 
might be twenty or thirty of them together, with their 
darts, or their bows and arrows, with which they could 
shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun? 

Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the place 
where they made their fire, and put in five or six 
pound of gunpowder, which, when they kindled their 
fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all 
that was near it. But as, in the first place, I should 
be very loth to waste so much powder upon them, 
my store being now within the quantity of one barrel, 
so neither could I be sure of its going off at any certain 
time, when it might surprise them; and, at best, that 
it would do little more than just blow the fire about 
their ears, and fright them, but not sufficient to make 
them forsake the place. So I laid it aside, and then 



FEAR OF SAVAGES 135 

proposed that I would place myself in ambush in some 
convenient place, with my three guns all double-loaded, 
and, in the middle of their bloody ceremony, let fly at 
them, when I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps 
two or three at every shot; and then falling in upon 
them with my three pistols and my sword, I made no 
doubt but that if there was twenty I should kill them 
all. This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks; 
and I was so full of it, that I often dreamed of it, and 
sometimes that I was just going to let fly at them in 
my sleep. 

I went so far with it in my imagination, that I 
employed myself several days to find out proper places 
to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to watch for 
them ; and I went frequently to the place itself, which 
was now grown more familiar to me; and especially 
while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge, 
and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to 
the sword, as I may call it, the horror I had at the 
place, and at the signals of the barbarous wretches 
devouring one another, abated my malice. 

Well, at length I found a place in the side of the 
hill, where I was satisfied I might securely wait till 
I saw any of their boats coming; and might then, 
even before they would be ready to come on shore, 
convey myself, unseen, into thickets of trees, in one 
of which there was a hollow large enough to conceal 
me entirely; and where I might sit and observe all 
their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their 
heads, when they were so close together, as that it 
would be next to impossible that I should miss my 
shot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of 
them at the first shot. 

In this place, then, I resolved to fix my design; and, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


136 

accordingly, I prepared two muskets and my ordinary 
fowling-piece. The two muskets I loaded with a brace 
of slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets, about 
the size of pistol-bullets; and the fowling-piece I loaded 
with near a handful of swan-shot, of the largest size. 
I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each; 
and in this posture, well provided with ammunition 
for a second or third charge, I prepared myself for my 
expedition. 

After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and 
in my imagination put it in practice, I continually 
made my tour every morning up to the top of the 
hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about 
three miles, or more, to see if I could observe any 
boats upon the sea coming near the island, or standing 
over towards it. But I began to tire of this hard duty, 
after I had, for two or three months, constantly kept 
my watch, but came always back without any dis- 
covery; there having not, in all that time, been the 
least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but 
not on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses 
could reach every way. 

As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to 
look out, so long also I kept up the vigour of my 
design, and my spirits seemed to be all the while in a 
suitable form for so outrageous an execution as the 
killing twenty or thirty naked savages for an offence 
which I had not at all entered into a discussion of in 
my thoughts, any farther than my passions were at 
first fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural 
custom of that people of the country. 

But when I had considered a little, it followed 
necessarily that I was certainly in the wrong in it; 
that these people were not murderers in the sense 



FEAR OF SAVAGES 


137 

that I had before condemned them in my thoughts, 
any more than those Christians were murderers who 
often put to death the prisoners taken in battle; or 
more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole 
troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter, 
though they threw down their arms and submitted. 

In the next place it occurred to me, that albeit the 
usage they thus gave one another was thus brutish 
and inhuman, yet it was really nothing to me; those 
people had done me no injury. That if they attempted 
me, or I saw it necessary for my immediate preserva- 
tion to fall upon them, something might be said for 
it ; but that as I was yet out of their power, and they 
had really no knowledge of me, and consequently no 
design upon me, and therefore it could not be just 
for me to fall upon them. 

These considerations really put me to a pause, and 
to a kind of a full stop; and I begun, by little and 
little, to be off of my design, and to conclude, I had 
taken wrong measures in my resolutions to attack the 
savages; that it was not my business to meddle with 
them, unless they first attacked me; and this it was 
my business, if possible, to prevent; but that if I 
were discovered and attacked, then I knew my duty. 

On the other hand, I argued with myself that thi& 
really was the way not to deliver myself, but entirely 
to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was sure to 
kill every one that not only should be on shore at that 
time, but that should ever come on shore afterwards, 
if but one of them escaped to tell their country people 
what had happened, they would come over again by 
thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and 
I should only bring upon myself a certain destruction, 
which, at present, I had no manner of occasion for. 



138 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

Upon the whole, I concluded that neither in prin- 
ciples nor in policy I ought, one way or other, to 
concern myself in this affair. That my business was, 
by all possible means, to conceal myself from them, 
and not to leave the least signal to them to guess by, 
that there were any living creatures upon the island; 
I mean of human shape. 

Religion joined in with this prudential, and I was 
convinced now, many ways, that I was perfectly out 
of my duty when I was laying all my bloody schemes 
for the destruction of innocent creatures ; I . mean 
innocent as to me. As to the crimes they were guilty 
of towards one another, I had nothing to do with 
them. They were national, and I ought to leave them 
to the justice of God, who is the Governor of nations, 
and knows how, by national punishments, to make a 
just retribution for national offences, and to bring 
public judgments upon those who offend in a public 
manner by such ways as best please Him. 

In this disposition I continued for near a year after 
this; and so far was I from desiring an occasion for 
falling upon these wretches, that in all that time I 
never once went up the hill to see whether there were 
any of them in sight, or to know whether any of them 
had been on shore there or not, that I might not be 
tempted to renew any of my contrivances against them, 
or be provoked, by any advantage which might present 
itself, to fall upon them. Only this I did, I went and 
removed my boat, which I had on the other side the 
island, and carried it down to the east end of the whole 
island, where I ran it into a little cove, which I found 
under some high rocks and where I knew, by reason of 
the currents, the savages durst not, at least would not 
come, with their boats, upon any account whatsoever. 



FEAR OF SAVAGES 139 

With my boat I carried away everything that I had 
left there belonging to her, though not necessary for 
the bare going thither, viz., a mast and sail which I 
had made for her and a thing like an anchor, but 
indeed which could not be called either anchor or 
grappling; however, it was the best I could make of 
its kind. All these I removed, that there might not 
be the least shadow of any discovery, or any appear- 
ance of any boat, or of any human habitation, upon 
the island. 

Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired 
than ever, and seldom went from my cell, other than 
upon my constant employment, viz., to milk my she- 
goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, which, 
as it was quite on the other part of the island, was 
quite out of danger; for certain it is, that these 
savage people, who sometimes haunted this island, 
never came with any thoughts of finding anything 
here, and consequently never wandered off from the 
coast; and I doubt not but they might have been 
several times on shore after my apprehensions of them 
had made me cautious, as well as before; and indeed, 
I looked back with some horror upon the thoughts of 
what my condition would have been if I had chopped 
upon them and been discovered before that, when, 
naked and unarmed, except with one gun, and that 
loaded often only with small shot, I walked everywhere, 
peeping and peeping about the island to see what I 
could get. What a surprise should I have been in if, 
when I discovered the print of a man's foot, I had, 
instead of that, seen fifteen or twenty savages and 
found them pursuing me, and by the swiftness of their 
running, no possibility of my escaping them ! 

I believe the reader of this will not think it strange if 



140 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

I confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I 
lived in, and the concern that was now upon me, put 
an end to all invention, and to all the contrivances 
that I had laid for my future accommodations and 
conveniences. I had the care of my safety more now 
upon my hands than that of my food. I cared not to 
drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the 
noise I should make should be heard ; much less would 
I fire a gun, for the same reason; and, above all, I was 
intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke, 
which is visible at a great distance in the day, should 
betray me; and for this reason I removed that part 
of my business which required fire, such as burning 
of pots and pipes, etc., into my new apartment in the 
woods; where, after I had been some time, I found, 
to my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave 
in the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, 
I dare say, no savage, had he been at the mouth of 
it, wbuld be so hardy as to venture in; nor, indeed, 
would any man else, but one who, like me, wanted 
nothing so much as a safe retreat. 

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a 

f eat rock, where, by mere accident I would say (if 
did not see abundant reason to ascribe all such 
things now to Providence), I was cutting down some 
thick branches of trees to make charcoal; and before 
I go on, I must observe the reason of my making this 
charcoal, which was thus. 

I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, 
as I said before; and yet I could not live there without 
baking my bread, cooking my meat, etc. So I con- 
trived to bum some wood here, as I had seen done in 
England under turf, till it became chark, or dry coal; 
and then putting the fire out, I preserved the coal to 



FEAR OF SAVAGES 141 

carry home, and perform the other services which fire 
was wanting for at home, without danger of smoke. 

But this is by-the-bye. While I was cutting down 
some wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick 
branch of low brushwood, or underwood, there was a 
kind of hollow place. I was curious to look into it; 
and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I 
found it was pretty large; that is to say, sufficient 
for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps another 
with me. But I must confess to you I made more 
haste out than I did in when, looking farther into the 
place, and which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad 
shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or man 
I knew not, which twinkled like two stars, the dim 
light from the cave’s mouth shining directly in, and 
making the reflection. 

But plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and 
encouraging myself a little with considering that the 
power and presence of God was everywhere, and was 
able to protect me, upon this I stepped forward again, 
and by the light of a firebrand, holding it up a little 
over my head, I 9 aw lying on the ground a most 
monstrous, frightful, old he-goat, just making his will, 
as we say, and gasping for life ; and dying indeed, of 
mere old age. 

I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, 
and he essayed to get up, but was not able to raise 
himself; and I thought with myself he might even 
lie there; for if he had frights me so, he would 
certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them 
should be so hardy as to come in there while he had 
any life in him. 

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began 
to look round me when I found the cave was but vety 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


142 

small; that is to say, it might be about twelve feet 
over, but in no manner of shape, either round or 
square, no hands having ever been employed in making 
it but for those of mere Nature. I observed also that 
there was a place at the farther side of it that went 
in farther, but was so low, that it required me to creep 
upon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither 
I went I knew not; so having a candle, I gave it over 
for some time, but resolved to come again the next 
day, provided with candles and a tinder-box, which 
I had made of the lock of one of the muskets, with 
some wild-fire in the pan. 

Accordingly the next day I came provided with six 
large candles of my own making, for I made very 
good candles now of goat's tallow; and going into 
this low place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours, 
as I have said, almost ten yards; which, by the way, 
I thought was a venture bold enough, considering that 
I knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond 
it. When I was got through the straight, I found the 
roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty feet. But 
never was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I 
dare say, as it was, to look round the sides and roof 
of this vault or cave; the walls reflected a hundred 
thousand lights to me from my two candles. What 
it was in the rock, whether diamonds, or any other 
precious stones, or gold, which I rather supposed it to 
be, I knew not. 

The place I was in was a most delightful cavity or 
grotto of its kind, as could be expected, though per- 
fectly dark. The floor was dry and level, and had a 
sort of small loose gravel upon it, so that there was 
no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen ; neither 
was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof. The 



FEAR OF SAVAGES 143 

only difficulty in it was the entrance, which, however, 
as it was a place of security, and such a retreat as I 
wanted, I thought that was a convenience; so that 
I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, 
without any delay, to bring some of those things which 
I was most anxious about to this place; particularly, 
I resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder, and 
all my spare arms, viz., two fowling-pieces, for I had 
three in all, and three muskets, for of them I had eight 
in all. So I kept at my castle only five, which stood 
ready-mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my outmost 
fence; and were ready also to take out upon any 
expedition. 

Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I 
took occasion to open the barrel of powder, which 
I took out of the sea, and which had been wet ; and I 
found that the water had penetrated about three or 
four inches into the powder on every side, which 
caking, and growing hard, had preserved the inside 
like a kernel in a shell; so that I had near sixty pounds 
of very good powder in the centre of the cask. And 
this was an agreeable discovery to me at that time; 
so I carried all away thither, never keeping above two 
or three pounds of powder with me in my castle, for 
fear of a surprise of any kind. I also carried thither 
all the lead I had left for bullets. 

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, 
which were said to live in caves and holes in the 
rocks, where none could come at them; for I per- 
suaded myself, while I was here, if five hundred 
savages were to hunt me, they could never find me 
out; or, if they did, they would not venture to attack 
me here. 

The old goat, whom I found expiring, died in th6 



144 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

mouth of the cave the next day after I made this 
discovery; and I found it much easier to dig a great 
hole there, and throw him in and cover him with 
earth, than to drag him out. 


CHAPTER XIII 

THE WRECK 

I was now in my twenty-third year of residence in 
this island; and was so naturalised to the place, and 
to the manner of living, that could I have but enjoyed 
the certainty that no savages would come to the 
place to disturb me, I could have been content to have 
capitulated for spending the rest of my time there, 
even to the last moment, till I had laid me down and 
died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also arrived 
to some little diversions and amusements, which made 
the time pass more pleasantly with me a great deal 
than it did before. As, first, I had taught my Poll, 
as I noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly, 
and talked so articulately and plain, that it was very 
pleasant to me; and he lived with me no less than 
six and twenty years. How long he might live after- 
wards I know not, though I know they have a notion 
in the Brazils that they live a hundred years. Perhaps 
poor Poll may be alive there still, calling after poor 
Robin Crusoe to this day. I wish no Englishman the 
ill luck to come there and hear him; but if he did, 
he wpuld certainly believe it was the devil. My dog 
was a very pleasant and loving companion to me for 
no less than sixteen years of my time, and then died 
of mere old age. As for my cats, they multiplied, as 



THE WRECK 145 

I have observed, to that degree, that I was obliged 
to shoot several of them at first to keep them from 
devouring me and all I had ; but at length, when the 
two old ones I brought with me were gone, and after 
some time continually driving them from me, and 
letting them have no provision with me, they all ran 
wild into the woods, except two or three favourites > 
which I kept tame, and whose young, when they had 
any, I always drowned; and these were part of my 
family. Besides these, I always kept two or three 
household kids about me, whom I taught to feed out 
of my hand. And I had two more parrots, which 
talked pretty well, and would all call " Robin Crusoe/' 
but none like my first ; nor, indeed, did I take the pains 
with any of them that I had done with him. I had also 
several tame sea-fowls, whose names I know not, whom 
I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings; and the 
little stakes which I had planted before my castle wall 
being now grown up to a good thick grove, these fowls 
all lived among these low trees, and bred there, which 
was very agreeable to me; so that, as I said above, 
I began to be very well contented with the life I led, 
if it might but have been secure from the dread of 
the savages. 

But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be 
amiss for all people who shall meet with my story, to 
make this just observation from it, viz., how frequently, 
in the course of our lives, the evil which in itself we 
seek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen into 
it, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very 
means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we 
can be raised again from the affliction we are fallen 
into. I could give many examples of this in the course 
of my unaccountable life ; but in nothing was it more 



146 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

particularly remarkable, than in the circumstances of 
my last years of solitary residence in this island. 

It was now the month of December, as I said above, 
in my twenty-third year; and this, being the southern 
solstice (for winter I cannot call it), was the particular 
time of my harvest, and required my being pretty 
much abroad in the fields; when, going out pretty 
early in the morning, even before it was thorough 
daylight, I was surprised with seeing a light of some 
fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about 
two miles, towards the end of the island, where I had 
observed some savages had been, as before. But not 
on the other side; but, to my great affliction, it was 
on my side of the island. 

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and 
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out, 
lest I might be surprised; and yet I had no more 
peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if 
these savages, in rambling over the island, should find 
my com standing or cut, or any of my works and im- 
provements, they would immediately conclude that 
there were people in the place, and would then never 
give over till they had found me out. In this extremity 
I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder 
after me, and made all things without look as wild 
and natural as I could. 

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a 
posture of defence. I loaded all my cannon, as I called 
them, that is to say, my muskets, which were mounted 
upon my new fortification, and all my pistols, and 
resolved to defend myself to the last gasp ; not forget- 
ting seriously to commend myself to the Divine pro- 
tection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver me out 
the hands of the barbarians. And in this posture I 



THE WRECK 147 

continued about two hours; but began to be mighty 
impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies 
to send out. 

After sitting a while longer, and musing what I 
should do in this case, I was not able to bear sitting 
in ignorance any longer; so setting up my ladder to 
the side of the hill where there was a flat place, as 
I observed before, and then pulling the ladder up 
after me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top 
of the hill; and pulling out my perspective-glass, which 
I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my 
belly on the ground, and began to look for the place. 
I presently found there was no less than nine naked 
savages sitting round a small fire they had made, not 
to warm them, for they had no need of that, the 
weather being extreme hot, but, as I supposed, to 
dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh 
which they had brought with them, whether alive or 
dead, I could not know. 

They had two canoes with them, which they had 
hauled up upon the shore; and as it was then tide 
of ebb, they seemed to me to wait for the return of 
the flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine 
what confusion this sight put me into, especially seeing 
them come on my side of the island, and so near me 
too. But when I observed their coming must be always 
with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be 
more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might 
go abroad with safety all the time of the tide of flood, 
if they were not on shore before; and having made 
this observation, I went abroad about my harvest- 
work with the more composure. 

As I expected, so it proved ; for as soon as the tide 
made to the westward, I saw them all take boat, and 



148 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

row (or paddle, as we call it) all away. I should have 
observed, that for an hour and more before they went 
off, they went to dancing; and I could easily discern 
their postures and gestures by my glasses. 

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took 
two guns upon shoulders, and two pistols at my 
girdle, and my great sword by my side, without a 
scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make 
I went away to the hill where I had discovered the 
first appearance of ail. And as soon as I got thither, 
which was not less than two hours (for I could not go 
apace, being so loden with arms as I was), I perceived 
there had been three canoes more of savages on that 
place; and looking out farther, I saw they were all 
at sea together, making over for the main. 

This was a dreadful sight to me, especially when, 
going down to the shore, I could see the marks of 
horror which the dismal work they had been about 
had left behind it, viz., the blood, the bones, and 
part of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoured 
by those wretches with merriment and sport. I was 
so filled with indignation at the sight, that I began 
now to premeditate the destruction of the next that 
I saw there, let them be who or how many soever. 

However, I wore out a year and three months more 
before I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I 
found them again/ as I shall soon observe. It is true 
they might have been there once or twice, but either 
they made no stay, or at least I did not hear them; 
but in the month of May, as near as I could calculate, 
and in my four and twentieth year, I had a very 
strange encounter with them ; of which in its place. 

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or 
sixteen months' interval, was very great. I slept 



THE WRECK 149 

unquiet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and often 
started out of my sleep in the night. In the day 
great troubles overwhelmed my mind, and in the 
night I dreamed often of killing the savages, and of 
the reasons why I might justify the doing of it. But, 
to waive all this for a while, it was in the middle of 
May, on the sixteenth day, I think, as well as my 
poor wooden calendar would reckon, for I marked all 
upon the post still ; I say, it was the sixteenth of May 
that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, with 
a great deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul 
night it was after it. I know not what was the par- 
ticular occasion of it, but as I was reading in the 
Bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts about 
my present condition, I was surprised with a noise of 
a gun, as I thought, fired at sea. 

This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite different 
nature from any I had met with before; for the 
notions this put into my thoughts were quite of another 
kind. I started up in the greatest haste imaginable, 
and, in a trice, clapped my ladder to the middle place 
of the rock, and pulled it after me; and mounting it 
the second time, got to the top of the hill the very 
moment that a flash of fire bid me listen for a second 
gun, which accordingly, in about half a minute, I 
heard; and, by the sound, knew that it was from that 
part of the sea where I was driven down the current 
in my boat. 

I immediately considered that this must be some 
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or 
some other ship in company, and fired these guns for 
signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had this 
presence of mind, at that minute, as to think that 
though I could not help them, it may be they might 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


150 

help me; so I brought together all the dry wood I 
could get at hand, and, making a good handsome pile, 
I set it on fire upon the hill. The wood was dry, and 
blazed freely; and though the wind blew very hard, 
yet it burnt fairly out ; so that I was certain, if there 
was any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it, 
and no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my fire 
blazed up I heard another gun, and after that several 
others, all from the same quarter. I plied my fire 
all night long till day broke; and when it was broad 
day, and the air cleared up, I saw something at a great 
distance at sea, full east of the island, whether a sail 
or a hull I could not distinguish, no, not with my 
glasses, the distance was so great, and the weather 
still something hazy also ; at least it was so out at sea. 

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon 
perceived that it did not move; so I presently con- 
cluded that it was a ship at an anchor. And being 
eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my 
gun in my hand and ran toward the south side of the 
island, to the rocks where I had formerly been carried 
away with the current; and getting up there, the 
weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could 
plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, 
cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks 
which I found when I was out in my boat ; and which 
rocks, as they checked the violence of the stream, and 
made a kind of counter-stream or eddy, were the 
occasion of my recovering from the most desperate, 
hopeless condition that ever I had been in in all my 
life. 

Thus, what is one man’s safety is another man’s 
destruction; for it seems these men, whoever they 
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks 



THE WRECK 151 

being wholly under water, had been driven upon them 
in the night, the wind blowing hard at E. and E.N.E. 
Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily suppose 
they did not, they must, as I thought, have endea- 
voured to have saved themselves on shore by the help 
of their boat ; but their firing of guns for help, especially 
when they saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with 
many thoughts. First, I imagined that upon seeing 
my light, they might have put themselves into their 
boat, and have endeavoured to make the shore; but 
that the sea going very high, they might have been 
cast away. Other times I imagined that they might 
have lost their boat before, as might be the case 
many ways; as, particularly, by the breaking of the 
sea upon their ship, which many times obliges men 
to stave, or take in pieces their boat, and sometimes 
to throw it overboard with their own hands. Other 
times I imagined they had some other ship or ships 
in company, who, upon the signals of distress they 
had made, had taken them up and carried them off. 
Other whiles I fancied they were all gone off to sea 
in their boat, and being hurried away by the current 
that I had been formerly in, were carried out into 
the great ocean, where there was nothing but misery 
and perishing; and that, perhaps, they might by this 
time think of starving, and of being in a condition to 
eat one another. 

As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the 
condition I was in, I could do no more than look on 
upon the misery of the poor men, and pity them; 
which had still this good effect on my side, that it 
gave me more and more cause to give thanks to God, 
who had so happily and comfortably provided for 
me in my desolate condition ; and that of two ships’ 



152 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

companies who were now cast away upon this part of 
the world, not one life should be spared but mine. I 
learned here again to observe, that it is very rare 
that the providence of God casts us into any condition 
of life so low, or any misery so great, but we may 
see something or other to be thankful for, and may see 
others in worse circumstances than our own. 

I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words, 
what a strange longing or hankering of desires I felt 
in my soul upon this sight, breaking out sometimes 
thus : “ Oh that there had been but one or two, nay, or 
but one soul, saved out of this ship, to have escaped 
to me, that I might but have had one companion, one 
fellow-creature, to have spoken to me, and to have 
conversed with! ” In all the time of my solitary life, 
I never felt so earnest, so strong a desire after the 
society of my fellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at 
the want of it. 

But it was not to be. Either their fate or mine, or 
both, forbid it ; for, till the last year of my being on 
this island, I never knew whether any were saved out 
of that ship or no; and had only the affliction, some 
days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come 
on shore at the end of the island which was next the 
shipwreck. He had on no clothes but a seaman's 
waistcoat, a paif of open-kneed linen drawers, and a 
blue linen shirt ; ' but nothing to direct me so much a9 
to guess what nation he was of. He had nothing in 
his pocket but two pieces of eight and a tobacco-pipe. 
The last was to me of ten times more value than the 
first. 

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture 
out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I 
might find something on board that might be useful 



THE WRECK 153 

to me. But that did not altogether press me so much 
as the possibility that there might be yet some living 
creature on board, whose life I might not only save, 
but might, by saving that life, comfort my own to 
the last degree. And this thought clung so to my heart, 
that I could not be quiet night nor day, but I must 
venture out in my boat on board this wreck; and 
committing the rest to God's providence, I thought, 
the impression was so strong upon my mind that it 
could not be resisted, that it must come from some 
invisible direction, and that I should be wanting to 
myself if I did not go. 

Under the power of this impression, I hastened back 
to my castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took 
a quantity of bread, a great pot for fresh water, a 
compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had still a 
great deal of that left), and a basket full of raisins. And 
thus, loading myself with everything necessary, I went 
down to my boat, got the water out of her, and got 
her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her and then went 
home again for more. My second cargo was a great 
bag full of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head 
for shade, another large pot full of fresh water, and 
about two dozen of my small loaves, or barley-cakes, 
more than before, with a bottle of goat's milk and a 
cheese; all which, with great labour and sweat, I 
brought to my boat. And praying to God to direct 
my voyage, I put out; and rowing, or paddling, the 
canoe along the shore, I came at last to the utmost 
point of the island on that side, viz., N.E. And now 
I was to launch out into the ocean, and either to ven- 
ture or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents 
which ran constantly on both sides of the island at 
a distance, and which were very terrible to me, from 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


154 

the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, 
and my heart began to fail me; for I foresaw that if 
I was driven into either of those currents, I should 
be carried a vast way out to sea, and perhaps out of 
my reach, or sight of the island again; and that then, 
as my boat was but small, if any little gale of wind 
should rise, I should be inevitably lost. 

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began 
to give over my enterprise; and having hauled my 
boat into a little creek on the shore, I stepped out, 
and sate me down upon a little rising bit of ground, 
very pensive and anxious, between fear and desire, 
about my voyage; when, as I was musing, I could 
perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood come 
on ; upon which my going was for so many hours im- 
practicable. Upon this, presently it occurred to me 
that I should go up to the highest piece of ground 
I could find and observe, if I could, how the sets of 
the tide, or currents, lay when the flood came in, that 
I might judge whether, if I was driven one way out, 
I might not expect to be driven another way home, 
with the same rapidness of the currents. This thought 
was no sooner in my head but I cast my eye upon a 
little hill, which sufficiently overlooked the sea both 
ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the 
currents, or sets oi the tide, and which way I was to 
guide myself in my return. Here I found, that as the 
current of the ebb set out close by the south point of 
the island, so the current of the flood set in close by 
the shore of the north side; and that I had nothing 
to do but to keep to the north of the island in my 
return, and I should do well enough. 

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the 
next morning to set out with the first of the tide, and 



THE WRECK 155 

reposing myself for the night in the canoe, under the 
great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out. I made 
first a little out to sea full north, till I began to feel 
the benefit of the current which set eastward, and 
which carried me at a great rate; and yet did not so 
hurry me as the southern side current had done before, 
and so as to take from me all government of the boat ; 
but having a strong steerage with my paddle, I went 
at a great rate directly for the wreck, and in less than 
two hours I came up to it. 

It was a dismal sight to look at. The ship, which, 
by its building, was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in 
between two rocks. All the stem and quarter of her 
was beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her fore- 
castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with great 
violence, her mainmast and foremast were brought by 
the board; that is to say, broken short off; but her 
bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared 
firm. When I came close to her a dog appeared upon her, 
who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried ; and as soon 
as I called him, jumped into the sea to come to me, 
and I took him into the boat, but found him almost 
dead for hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake of my 
bread, and he ate it like a ravenous wolf that had been 
starving a fortnight in the snow. I then gave the poor 
creature some fresh water, with which, if I would have 
let him, he would have burst himself. 

After this I went on board; but the first sight I 
met with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or 
forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about one 
another. I concluded, as is indeed probable, that when 
the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so 
high, and so continually over her, that the men were 
not able to bear it, and were strangled with the constant 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


156 

rushing in of the water, as much as if they had been 
under water. Besides the dog, there was nothing left 
in the ship that had life; nor any goods that I could 
see, but what were spoiled by the water. There were 
some casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew 
not, which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water 
being ebbed out, I could see; but they were too big 
to meddle with. I saw several chests, which I believed 
belonged to some of the seamen; and I got two of 
them into the boat, without examining what was in 
them. 

Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the fore- 
part broken off, I am persuaded I might have made 
a good voyage; for by what I found in these two 
chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a great 
deal of wealth on board; and if I may guess by the 
course she steered, she must have been bound from 
the Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south 
part of America, beyond the Brazils, to the Havana, 
in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. She 
had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no use, 
at that time, to anybody; and what became of the 
rest of her people, I then knew not. 

I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of 
liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into my 
boat with much difficulty. There were several muskets 
in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about four 
pounds of powder in it. As for the muskets, I had no 
occasion for them, so I left them, but took the powder- 
horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs, which I wanted 
extremely; as also two little brass kettles, a copper 
pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron. And with this 
cargo, and the dog, I came away, the tide beginning 
to make home again; and the same evening, about an 



THE WRECK 157 

hour within night, I reached the island again, weary 
and fatigued to the last degree. 

I reposed that night in the boat ; and in the morning 
I resolved to harbour what I had gotten in my new 
cave, not to carry it home to my castle. After refresh- 
ing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and began to 
examine the particulars. The cask of liquor I found 
to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the 
Brazils, and, in a word, not at all good. But when 
I came to open the chests, I found several things of 
great use to me. For example, I found in one a fine 
case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled 
with cordial waters, fine, and very good; the bottles 
held about three pints each, and were tipped with 
silver. I found two pots of very good succades, or 
sweetmeats, so fastened also on top, that the salt 
water had not hurt them; and two more of the same, 
which the water had spoiled. I found some very good 
shirts, which were very welcome to me; and about a 
dozen and a half of linen white handkerchiefs and 
coloured neckcloths. The former were also very 
welcome, being exceeding refreshing to wipe my face 
in a hot day. Besides this, when I came to the till 
in the chest, I found there three great bags of pieces 
of eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces 
in all; and in one of them, wrapped up in a paper, 
six doubloons of gold, and some small bars or wedges 
of gold. I suppose they might all weigh near a pound. 

The other chest I found had some clothes in it, but 
of little value; but by the circumstances, it must have 
belonged to the gunner's mate; though there was no 
powder in it, but about two pounds of fine glazed 
powder, in three small flasks, kept, I suppose, for 
charging their fowling-pieces, on occasion. Upon the 



158 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

whole, I got very little by this voyage that was of 
any use to me; for as to the money, I had no manner 
of occasion for it; 'twas to me as the dirt under my 
feet; and I would have given it all for three of four 
pair of English shoes and stockings, which were things 
I greatly wanted, but had not had on my feet now 
for many years. I had indeed gotten two pairs of 
shoes now, which I took off the feet of the two drowned 
men whom I saw in the wreck, and I found two pair 
more in one of the chests, which were very welcome 
to me; but they were not like our English shoes, 
either for ease or service, being rather what we call 
pumps than shoes. I found in this seaman's chest 
about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no gold. I 
suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the other, 
which seemed to belong to some officer. 

Well, however, I lugged this money home to my 
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before which 
I brought from our own ship; but it was great pity, 
as I said, that the other part of this ship had not come 
to my share, for I am satisfied I might have loaded 
my canoe several times over with money, which, if I 
had ever escaped to England, would have lain here safe 
enough till I might have come again and fetched it. 

Having now brought all my things on shore, and 
secured them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or 
paddled her along the shore to her old harbour, where 
I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my 
old habitation, where I found everything safe and 
quiet. So I began to repose myself, live after my old 
fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and, for 
a while, I lived easy enough, only that I was more 
vigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did 
not go abroad so much ; and if at any time I did stir 



MAN FRIDAY 159 

with any freedom, it was always to the east part of 
the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the savages 
never came, and where I could go without so many 
precautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition 
as I always carried with me if I went the other way. 

I lived in this condition near two years more; but 
my unlucky head, that was always to let me know it 
was bom to make my body miserable, was all this 
two years filled with projects and designs, how, if it 
were possible, I might get away from this island ; for 
sometimes I was for making another voyage to the 
wreck, though my reasons told me that there was 
nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage; 
sometimes for a ramble one way sometimes another; 
and I believe verily, if I had had the boat that I went 
from Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea, bound 
anywhere, I knew not whither. 

I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento 
to those who are touched with the general plague of 
mankind, whence, for aught I know, one-half of their 
miseries flow; I mean, that of not being satisfied with 
the station wherein God and Nature has placed them. 


CHAPTER XIV 

MAN FRIDAY 

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in 
March, the four and twentieth year of my first setting 
foot in this island of solitariness. I was lying in my 
bed, or hammock, awake, very well in health, had no- 
pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, no, nor 
any uneasiness of mind, more than ordinary, but could 



i6o ROBINSON CRUSOE 

by no means close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep; no, 
not a wink all night long, otherwise than as follows. 

It is as impossible, as needless, to set down the 
innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled through 
that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in 
this night’s time. I ran over the whole history 
of my life in miniature, or by abridgment, as I may 
call it, to my coming to this islahd, and also of the 
part of my life since I came to this island. 

My head was for some time taken up in considering 
the nature of these wretched creatures, I mean the 
savages, and how it came to pass in the world that 
the wise Governor of all things should give up any of 
His creatures to such inhumanity; nay, to something 
so much below even brutality itself, as to devour its 
own kind. But as this ended in some (at that time 
fruitless) speculations, it occurred to me to inquire 
what part of the. world these wretches lived in? how 
far off the coast was from whence they came? what 
they ventured over so far from home for? what kind 
of boats they had ? and why I might not order myself 
and my business so, that I might be as able to go 
over thither, as they were to come to me. 

I never so much as troubled myself to consider 
what I should do with myself when I came thither; 
what would become of me, if I fell into the hands of 
the savages; or how I should escape from them, if 
they attempted me; no, nor so much as how it was 
possible for me to reach the coast, and not be attempted 
by some or other of them, without any possibility of 
delivering myself; and if I should not fall into their 
hands, what I should do for provision, or whither I 
should bend my course. None of these thoughts, I 
say, so much as came in my way; but my mind was 



MAN FRIDAY 161 

wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in 
my boat to the mainland. I looked back upon my 
present condition as the most miserable that could 
possibly be ; that I was not able to throw myself into 
anything, but death, that could be called worse; that 
if I reached the shore of the main, I might perhaps 
meet with relief, or I might coast along, as I did on 
the shore of Africa, till I came to some inhabited 
country, and where I might find some relief; and after 
all, perhaps I might fall in with some Christian ship 
that might take me in ; and if the worse came to the 
worst, I could but die, which would put an end to all 
these miseries at once. 

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours, 
or more, with such violence that it set my very blood 
into a ferment, and my pulse beat as high as if I had 
been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervour 
of my mind about it, Nature, as if I had been fatigued 
and exhausted with the very thought of it, threw me 
into a sound sleep. One would have thought I should 
have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything 
relating to it ; but I dreamed that as I was going out 
in the morning, as usual, from my castle, I saw upon 
the shore two canoes and eleven savages coming to 
land, and that they brought with them another savage, 
whom they were going to kill in order to eat him; 
when, on a sudden, the savage that they were going 
to kill jumped away and ran for his life. And I thought 
in my sleep, that tie came running into my little thick 
grove before my fortification to hide himself; and that 
I, seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the other 
sought him that way, showed myself to him, and 
smiling upon him, encouraged him; that he kneeled 
down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him; upon 

F 



162 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 


which I showed my ladder, made him go up, and 
carried him into my cave, and he became my servant ; 
and that as soon as I had gotten this man, I said to 
myself, “ Now I may certainly venture to the main- 
land ; for this fellow will serve me as a pilot, and will 
tell me what to do, and whither to go for provisions, 
and whither not to go for fear of being devoured; 
what places to venture into, and what to escape.* 1 I 
waked with this thought, and was under such inex- 
pressible impressions of joy at the prospect of my 
escape in my dream, that the disappointments which 
I felt upon coming to myself and finding it was no 
more than a dream were equally extravagant the other 
way, and threw me into a very dejection of spirit. 

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion; that 
my only way to go about an attempt for an escape 
was, if possible, to get a savage into my possession; 
and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners, 
whom they had condemned to be eaten, and should 
bring hither to kill. But these thoughts still were 
attended with this difficulty, that it was impossible 
to effect this without attacking a whole caravan of 
them, and killing them all; and this was not only a 
very desperate attempt, and might miscarry, but, on 
the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the lawfulness 
of it to me; and my heart trembled at the thoughts 
of shedding so much blood, though it was for my 
deliverance. I need not repeat the arguments which 
occurred to me against this, they being the same men- 
tioned before. But though I had other reasons to offer 
now, viz., that those men were enemies to my life, 
and would devour me if they could; that it was self- 
preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself 
from this death of a life, and was acting in my own 



MAN FRIDAY 163 

defence as much as if they were actually assaulting 
me, and the like; I say, though these things argued 
for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human blood for 
my deliverance were very terrible to me, and such as 
I could by no means reconcile myself to a great while. 

However, at last, after many secret disputes with 
myself, and after great perplexities about it, for all 
these arguments, one way and another, struggled in 
my head a long time, the eager prevailing desire of 
deliverance at length mastered all the rest, and I 
resolved, if possible, to get one of those savages into 
my hands, cost what it would. My next thing then 
was to contrive how to do it, and this indeed was very 
difficult to resolve on. But as I could pitch upon no 
probable means for it, so I resolved to put myself 
upon the watch, to see them when they came on shore, 
and leave the rest to the event, taking such measures 
as the opportunity should present, let be what would be. 

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself 
upon the scout as often as possible, and indeed so 
often, till I was heartily tired of it; for it was above 
a year and half that I waited; and for great part of 
that time went out to the west end, and to the south- 
west corner of the island, almost every day, to seek for 
canoes, but none appeared. This was very discouraging, 
and began to trouble me much; though I cannot say 
that it did in this case, as it had done some time before 
that, viz., wear off the edge of my desire to the thing. 
But the longer it seemed to be delayed, the more eager 
I was for it. In a word, I was not at first so careful 
to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being 
seen by them, as I was now eager to be upon them. 

Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, 
two or three savages, if I had them, so as to make 



164 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should 
direct them, and to prevent their being able at any 
time to do me any hurt. It was a great while that I 
pleased myself with this affair; but nothing still pre- 
sented. All my fancies and schemes came to nothing, 
for no savages came near me for a great while. 

About a year and half after I had entertained these 
notions, and by long musing had, as it were, resolved 
them all into nothing, for want of an occasion to put 
them in execution, I was surprised, one morning early, 
with seeing no less than five canoes all on shore to- 
gether on my side the island, and the people who 
belonged to them all landed, and out of my sight. 
The number of them broke all my measures; for 
seeing so many, and knowing that they always came 
four, or six, or sometimes more, in a boat, I could not 
tell what to think of it, or how to take my measures 
to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; so I 
lay still in my castle, perplexed and discomforted. 
However, I put myself into all the postures for an 
attack if anything had presented. Having waited a 
good while, listening to hear if they made any noise, 
at length, being very impatient, I set my guns at the 
foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of the 
hill, by my two stages, as usual; standing so, however, 
that my head did not appear above the hill, so that 
they could not perceive me by any means. Here I 
observed, by the help of my perspective glass, that 
they were no less than thirty in number, that they 
had a fire kindled, that they had had meat dressed. 
How they had cooked it, that I knew not, or what it 
was; but they were all dancing, in I know not how 
many barbarous gestures and figures, their own way, 
round the fire. 



MAN FRIDAY 165 

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived by 
my perspective two miserable wretches dragged from 
the boats, where, it seems, they were laid by, and were 
now brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one of 
them immediately fell, being knocked down, I suppose, 
with a club or wooden sword, for that was their way, 
and two or three others were at work immediately, 
cutting him open for their cookery, while the other 
victim was left standing by himself, till they should be 
ready for him. In that very moment this poor wretch 
seeing himself a little at liberty. Nature inspired him 
with hopes of life, and he started away from them, 
and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands 
directly towards me, I mean towards that part of the 
coast where my habitation was. 

I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowledge) 
when I perceived him to run my way, and especially 
when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by the whole 
body; and now I expected that part of my dream 
was coming to pass, and that he would certainly take 
shelter in my grove; but I could not depend, by any 
means, upon my dream for the rest of it, viz., that 
the other savages would not pursue him thither, and 
find him there. However, I kept my station, and my 
spirits began to recover when I found that there was 
not above three men that followed him; and still 
more was I encouraged when I found that he out- 
stripped them exceedingly in running, and gained 
ground of them; so that if he could but hold it for 
half-an-hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away 
from them all. 

There was between them and my castle the creek, 
which I mentioned often at the first part of my story, 
when I landed my cargoes out of the ship; and this 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


1 66 

I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the 
poor wretch would be taken there. But when the 
savage escaping came thither he made nothing of it, 
though the tide was then up; but plunging in, swam 
through in about thirty strokes or thereabouts, landed, 
and ran on with exceeding strength and swiftness. 
When the three persons came to the creek, I found 
that two of them could swim, but the third could not, 
and that, standing on the other side, he looked at the 
other, but went no further, and soon after went softly 
back, which, as it happened, was very well for him in 
the main. 

I observed, that the two who swam were yet more 
than twice as long swimming over the creek as the 
fellow was that fled from them. It came now very 
warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, 
that now was my time to get me a servant, and per- 
haps a companion or assistant, and that I was called 
plainly by Providence to save this poor creature’s life. 
I immediately ran down the ladders with all possible 
expedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both 
but at the foot of the ladders, as I observed above, 
and getting up again, with the same haste, to the top 
of the hill, I crossed toward the sea, and having a 
very short cut, and all down hill, clapped myself in 
the way between the pursuers and the pursued, halloo- 
ing aloud to him that fled, who, looking back, was at 
first perhaps as much frighted at me as at them; but 
I beckoned with my hand to him to come back; and, 
in the meantime, I slowly advanced towards the two 
that followed; then rushing at once upon the fore- 
most, I knocked him down with the stock of my piece. 
I was loth to fire, because I would not have the rest 
hear; though, at that distance, it would not have 



MAN FRIDAY 167 

been easily heard, and being out of sight of the smoke 
too, they would not have easily known what to make 
of it. Having knocked this fellow down, the other who 
pursued with him stopped, as if he had been frighted, 
and I advanced apace towards him; but as I came 
nearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, 
and was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then 
necessitated to shoot at him first, which I did, and 
killed him at the first shot. 

The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though 
he saw both his enemies fallen and killed, as he 
thought, yet was so frighted with the fire and noise 
of my piece, that he stood stock-still, and neither 
came forward or went backward, though he seemed 
rather inclined to fly still, than to come on. I hallooed 
again to him, and made signs to come forward, which 
he easily understood, and came a little way, then 
stopped again, and then a little further, and stopped 
again; and I could then perceive that he stood trem- 
bling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just 
been to be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned 
him again to come to me, and gave him all the signs 
of encouragement that I could think of; and he came 
nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve 
steps, in token of acknowledgment for my saving his 
life. I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and 
beckoned to him to come still nearer. At length he 
came close to me, and then he kneeled down again, 
kissed the ground, and laid his head upon the ground, 
and taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head. 
This, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my slave 
for ever. I took him up, and made much of him, and 
encouraged him all I could. But there was more work 
to do yet ; for I perceived the savage whom I knocked 



168 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

down was not killed, but stunned with the blow, and 
began to come to himself; so I pointed to him, and 
showing him the savage, that he was not dead, upon 
this he spoke some words to me; and though I could 
not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant 
to hear; for they were the first sound of a man's voice 
that I had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty- 
five years. But there was no time for such reflections 
now. The savage who was knocked down recovered 
himself so far as to sit up upon the ground, and I 
perceived that my savage began to be afraid; but 
when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the 
man, as if I would shoot him. Upon this my savage, 
for so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend 
him my sword, which hung naked in a belt by my 
side; so I did. He no sooner had it but he runs to his 
enemy, and, at one blow, cut off his head as cleverly, 
no executioner in Germany could have done it sooner 
or better; which I thought very strange for one who, 
I had reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life 
before, except their own wooden swords. However, 
it seems, as I learned afterwards, they make their 
wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is 
so hard, that they will cut off heads even with them, 
ay, and arms, and that at one blow too. When he had 
done this, he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, 
and brought me the sword again, and with abundance 
of gestures, which I did not understand, laid it down, 
with the head of the savage that he had killed, just 
before me. 

But that which astonished him most was to know 
how I had killed the other Indian so far off; so 
pointing to him, he made signs to me to let him go 
to him; so I bade him go, as well as I could. When 



MAN FRIDAY 169 

he came to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at 
him, turned him first on one side, then on t'other, 
looked at the wound the bullet had made, which, it 
seems, was just in his breast, where it had made a 
hole, and no great quantity of blood had followed; 
but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead. He 
took up 'his bow and arrows and came back; so I 
turned to go away, and beckoned to him to follow me, 
making signs to him that more might come after them. 

Upon this he signed to me that he should bury them 
with sand, that they might not be seen by the rest if 
they followed; and so I made signs again to him to 
do so. He fell to work, and in an instant he had scraped 
a hole in the sand with his hands big enough to bury 
the first in, and then dragged him into it, and covered 
him, and did so also by the other. I believe he had 
buried them both in a quarter of an hour. Then 
calling him away, I carried him, not to my castle, but 
quite away to my cave, on the farthest part of the 
island ; so I did not let my dream come to pass in that 
part, viz., that he came into my grove for shelter. 

Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to 
eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was 
indeed in great distress for, by his running ; and having 
refreshed him, I made signs for him to go lie down 
and sleep, pointing to a place where I had laid a great 
parcel of rice-straw, and a blanket upon it, which I 
used to sleep upon myself sometimes; so the poor 
creature laid down, and went to sleep. 

He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well 
made, with straight strong limbs, not too large, tall, 
and well-shaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-six 
years of age. He had a very good countenance, not a 
fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have something 



170 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

very manly in his face; and yet he had all the sweet- 
ness and softness of an European in his countenance 
too, especially when he smiled. His hair was long and 
black, not curled like wool; his forehead very high 
and large; and a great vivacity and sparkling sharp- 
ness in his eyes. The colour of his skin was not quite 
black, but very tawny; and yet not of an ugly, 
yellow, nauseous tawny as the Brazilians and Virgin- 
ians and other natives of America are, but of a bright 
kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it something 
very agreeable, though not very easy to describe. His 
face was round and plump; his nose small, not flat 
like the negroes; a very good mouth, thin lips, and 
his fine teeth well set, and white as ivory. 

After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about 
half-an-hour, he waked again, and comes out of the 
cave to me, for I had been milking my goats, which 
I had in the enclosure just by. When he espied me, 
he came running to me, laying himself down again 
upon the ground, with all the possible signs of an 
humble, thankful disposition, making a many antic 
gestures to show it. At last he lays his head flat upon 
the ground close to my foot, and sets my other foot 
upon his head, as he had done before, and after this 
made all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and 
submission imaginable, to let me know how he would 
serve me as long as he lived. I understood him in 
many things, and let him know I was very well pleased 
with him. In a little time I began to speak to him, 
and teach him to speak to me; and, first, I made 
him know his name should be Friday, which was the 
day I saved his life. I called him so for the memory 
of the time. I likewise taught him to say master, and 
then let him know that was to be my name. I like- 



MAN FRIDAY 171 

wise taught him to say Yes and No, and to know the 
meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an earthen 
pot, and let him see me drink it before him, and sop 
my bread in it ; and I gave him a cake of bread to do 
the like, which he quickly complied with, and made 
signs that it was very good for him. 

I kept there with him all that night; but as soon 
as it was day, I beckoned to him to come with me, 
and let him know I would give him some clothes ; at 
which he seemed very glad, for he was stark naked. 
As we went by the place where he had buried the two 
men, he pointed exactly to the place, and showed me 
the marks that he had made to find them again, making 
signs to me that we should dig them up again, and eat 
them. At this I appeared very angry, expressed my 
abhorrence of it, and beckoned with my hand to him 
to come away; which he did immediately, with great 
submission. I then led him up to the top of the hill, 
to see if his enemies were gone; and pulling out my 
glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place where they 
had been, but no appearance of them or of their canoes ; 
so that it was plain that they were gone, and had left 
their two comrades behind them, without any search 
after them. 

But I was not content with this discovery; but 
having now more courage, and consequently more 
curiosity, I takes my man Friday with me, giving 
him the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows 
at his back, which I found he could use very dexter- 
ously, making him carry one gun for me, and I two 
for myself, and away we marched to the place where 
these creatures had been; for I had a mind now to 
get some fuller intelligence of them. When I came 
to the place, my very blood ran chill in my veins, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


172 

and my heart sunk within me, at the horror of the 
spectacle. Indeed, it was a dreadful sight, at least it 
was so to me, though Friday made nothing of it. The 
place was covered with human bones, the ground dyed 
with their blood, great pieces of flesh left here and 
there, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in 
short, all the tokens of the triumphant feast they had 
been making there, after a victory over their enemies. 
I saw three skulls, five hands, and the bones of three 
or four legs and feet, and abundance of other parts 
of the bodies; and Friday, by his signs, made me 
understand that they brought over four prisoners to 
feast upon; that three of them were eaten up, and 
that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth; that 
there had been a great battle between them and their 
next king, whose subjects it seems he had been one of, 
and that they had taken a great number of prisoners; 
all which were carried to several places by those that 
had taken them in the fight, in order to feast upon 
them, as was done here by these wretches upon those 
they brought hither. 

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, 
and whatever remained, and lay them together on a 
heap, and make a great fire upon it, and bum them 
all to ashes. I found Friday had still a hankering 
stomach after some of the flesh, and was still a cannibal 
in his nature; but I discovered so much abhorrence 
at the very thoughts of it, and at the least appearance 
of it, that he durst not discover it ; for I had, by some 
means let him know that I would kill him if he offered it. 

When we had done this we came back to our castle, 
and there I fell to work for my man Friday; and, 
first of all, I gave him a pair of linen drawers, which 
I had out of the poor gunner's chest I mentioned, 



MAN FRIDAY 173 

and which I found in the wreck; and which, with a 
little alteration, fitted him very well. Then I made 
him a jerkin of goat’s-skin, as well as my skill would 
allow, and I was now grown a tolerable good tailor; 
and I gave him a cap, which I made of a hare-skin, 
very convenient and fashionable enough; and thus he 
was clothed for the present tolerably well, and was 
mighty well pleased to see himself almost as well clothed 
as his master. It is true he went awkwardly in these 
things at first ; wearing the drawers was very awkward 
to him, and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his 
shoulders, and the inside of his arms ; but a little easing 
them where he complained they hurt him, and using 
himself to them, at length he took to them very well. 

The next day after I came home to my hutch with 
him, I began to consider where I should lodge him. 
And that I might do well for him, and yet be perfectly 
easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the vacant 
place between my two fortifications, in the inside of 
the last and in the outside of the first; and as there 
was a door or entrance there into my cave, I made 
a formal framed door-case, and a door to it of boards, 
and set it up in the passage, a little within the entrance ; 
and causing the door to open on the inside, I barred 
it up in the night, taking in my ladders too; so that 
Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my 
innermost wall without making so much noise in 
getting over, that it must needs waken me; for my 
first wall had now a complete roof over it of long 
poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the side 
of the hill, which was again laid across with smaller 
sticks instead of laths, and then thatched over a great 
thickness with the rice-straw, which was strong, like 
reeds; and at the hole or place which was left to go 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


174 

in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap- 
door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside, 
would not have opened at all, but would have fallen 
down, and made a great noise; and as to weapons, 
I took them all into my side every night. 

But I needed none of all this precaution ; for never* 
man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than 
Friday was to me; without passions, sullenness, or 
designs, perfectly obliged and engaged ; his very affec- 
tions were tied to me, like those of a child to a father; 
and I dare say he would have sacrificed his life for 
the saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever. The 
many testimonials he gave me of this put it out of 
doubt, and soon convinced me that I needed to use 
no precautions as to my safety on his account. 

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and 
that with wonder, that however it had pleased God, 
in His providence, and in the government of the 
works of His hands, to take from so great a part of 
the world of His creatures the best uses to which their 
faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted, 
yet that He has bestowed upon them the same powers, 
the same reason, the same affections, the same senti- 
ments of kindness and obligation, the same passions 
and resentments of wrongs, the same sense of grati- 
tude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities of doing 
good, and receiving good, that He has given to us; 
and that when He pleases to offer to them occasions 
of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more ready, 
to apply them to the right uses for which they were 
bestowed than we are. 

But to return to my new companion. I was greatly 
delighted with him, and made it my business to teach 
him everything that was proper to make him useful, 



MAN FRIDAY 


175 

handy, and helpful; but especially to make him speak, 
and understand me when I spake. And he was the 
aptest scholar that ever was; and particularly was so 
merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased when he 
could but understand me, or make me understand him, 
that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him. And 
now my life began to be so easy, that I began to say 
to myself, that could I but have been safe from more 
savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from 
the place while I lived. 

After I had been two or three days returned to my 
castle, I thought that, in order to bring Friday off 
from his horrid way of feeding, and from the relish 
of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him taste 
other flesh; so I took him out with me one morning 
to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid 
out of my own flock, and bring him home and dress 
it; but as I was going, I saw a she-goat lying down 
in the shade, and two young kids sitting by her. I 
catched hold of Friday. “ Hold,” says I, " stand still,” 
and made signs to him not to stir. Immediately I 
presented my piece, shot and killed one of the kids. 
The poor creature, who had, at a distance indeed, 
seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did not know, 
or could imagine, how it was done, was sensibly sur- 
prised and shook, and looked so amazed, that I thought 
he would have sunk down. He did not see the kid I 
had shot at, or perceive I had killed it, but ripped up 
his waistcoat to feel if he was not wounded; and, as 
I found presently, thought I was resolved to kill him; 
for he came and kneeled down to me, and embracing 
my knees, said a great many things I did not under- 
stand ; but I could easily see that the meaning was to 
pray me not to kill him. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


176 

I soon found a way to convince him that I would 
do him no harm; and taking him up by the hand, 
laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which I had 
killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he 
did; and while he was wondering, and looking to see 
how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun again; 
and by-and-by I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sit 
upon a tree, within shot ; so, to let Friday understand 
a little what I would do, I called him to me again, 
pointing at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though 
I thought it had been a hawk; I say, pointing to the 
parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under the 
parrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made him 
understand that I would shoot and kill that bird. 
Accordingly I fired, and bade him look, and immedi- 
ately he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one frighted 
again, notwithstanding all I had said to him; and I 
found he was the more amazed, because he did not 
see me put anything into the gun, but thought that 
there must be some wonderful fund of death and 
destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, 
bird, or anything near or far off; and the astonish- 
ment this created in him was such as could not wear 
off for a long time; and I believe, if I would have 
let him, he would have worshipped me and my gun. 
As for the gun itself, he would not so much as touch 
it for several days after; but would speak to it, and 
talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was by 
himself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was 
to desire it not to kill him. 

Well, after his astonishment was a little over at 
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I 
had shot, which he did, but stayed some time; for 
the parrot, not being quite dead, was fluttered a good 



MAN FRIDAY 


1 77 

way off from the place she fell. However, he found 
her, took her up, and brought her to me; and as I 
had perceived his ignorance about the gun before, I 
took this advantage to charge the gun again, and not 
let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any 
mark tfiat might present. But nothing more offered 
at that time; so I brought home the kid, and the 
same evening I took the skin off, and cut it out as well 
as I could; and having a pot for that purpose, I 
boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some 
very good broth; and after I had begun to eat some, 
I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, 
and liked it very well; but that which was strangest 
to him, was to see me eat salt with it. He made a 
sign to me that the salt was not good to eat, and 
putting a little into his own mouth, he seemed to 
nauseate it, and would spit and splutter at it, washing 
his mouth with fresh water after it. On the other hand, 
I took some meat in my mouth without salt, and I 
pretended to spit and splutter for want of salt, as fast 
as he had done at the salt. But it would not do; he 
would never care for salt with his meat or in his 
broth; at least, not a great while, and then but a very 
little. 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, 
I was resolved to feast him the next day with roasting 
a piece of the kid. This I did by hanging it before 
the fire in a string, as I had seen many people do in 
England, setting two poles up, one on each side of 
the fire, and one across on the top, and tying the string 
to the cross stick, letting the meat turn continually. 
This Friday admired very much. But when he came 
to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me 
how well he liked it, that I could not but understand 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


178 

him; and at last he told me he would never eat man's 
flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear. 

The next day I set him to work to beating some corn 
out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I 
observed before; and he soon understood how to do 
it as well as I, especially after he had seen what the 
meaning of it was, and that it was to make bread of; 
for after that I let him see me make my bread, and 
bake it too; and in a little time Friday was able to 
do all the work for me, as well as I could do it myself. 


CHAPTER XV 

LIFE WITH FRIDAY 

I began now to consider that, having two mouths 
to feed instead of one, I must provide more ground 
for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn 
than I used to do; so I marked out a larger piece of 
land, and began the fence in the same manner as 
before, in which Friday not only worked very willingly 
and very hard, but did it very cheerfully; and I told 
him what it was for; that it was for com to make 
more bread, because he was now with me, and that 
I might have enough for him and myself too. He 
appeared very sensible of that part, and let me know 
that he thought I had much more labour upon me on 
his account, than I had for myself ; and that he would 
work the harder for me, if I would tell him what to do. 

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in 
this place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and 
understand the names of almost everything I had 
occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send 
him to, and talk a great deal to me; so that, in short, 



LIFE WITH FRIDAY 179 

I began now to have some use for my tongue again, 
which, indeed, I had very little occasion for before, 
that is to say, about speech. Besides the pleasure of 
talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the 
fellow himself. His simple, unfeigned honesty appeared 
to me more and more every day, and I began really 
to love the creature; and, on his side, I believe he 
loved me more than it was possible for him ever to 
love anything before. 

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering 
inclination to his own country again; and having 
learned him English so well that he could answer me 
almost any questions, I asked him whether the nation 
that he belonged to never conquered in battle? At 
which he smiled, and said, “ Yes, yes, we always fight 
the better ” ; that is, he meant, always get the better 
in fight; and so we began the following discourse: 
" You always fight the better,” said I. " How came 
you to be taken prisoner then, Friday? ” 

Friday . My nation beat much for all that. 

Master. How beat ? If your nation beat them, how 
came you to be taken? 

Friday . They more many than my nation in the 
place where me was; they take one, two, three, and 
me. My nation overbeat them in the yonder place, 
where me no was; there my nation take one, two, 
great thousand. 

Master. But why did not your side recover you from 
the hands of your enemies then ? 

Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and make 
go in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that time. 

Master. Well, Friday, and what does your nation 
do with the men they take? Do they carry them 
away and eat them, as these did? 



180 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

Friday . Yes, my nation eats mans too; eat all up. 

Master . Where do they carry them ? 

Friday . Go to other place, where they think. 

Master . Do they come hither ? 

Friday . Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else 
place. 

Master. Have you been here with them ? 

Friday . Yes, I been here. (Points to the N.W. side 
of the island which , it seems, was their side.) 

By this I understood that my man Friday had 
formerly been among the savages who used to come 
on shore on the farther part of the island, on the 
same man-eating occasions that he was now brought 
for; and, some time after, when I took the courage 
to carry him to that side, being the same I formerly 
mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told me 
he was there once when they eat up twenty men, 
two women, and one child. He could not tell twenty 
in English, but he numbered them by laying so many 
stones on a row, and pointing to me to tell them over. 

I have told this passage, because it introduces what 
follows ; that after I had had this discourse with him, 
I asked him how far it was from our island to the shore, 
and whether the canoes were not often lost. He told 
me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost; but 
that, after a little way out to the sea, there was a 
current and a wind, always one way in the morning, 
the other in the afternoon. 

This I understood to be no more than the sets of 
the tide, as going out or coming in ; but I afterwards 
understood it was occasioned by the great draught 
and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth 
of the gulf of which river, as I found afterwards, our 
island lay; and this land which I perceived to the 



LIFE WITH FRIDAY 181 

W. and N.W. was the great island Trinidad, on the 
north point of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday 
a thousand questions about the country, the inhabit- 
ants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were near. 
He told me all he knew, with the greatest openness 
imaginable. I asked him the names of the several 
nations of his sort of people, but could get no other 
name than Caribs; from whence I easily understood 
that these were the Caribbees, which our maps place 
on the part of America which reaches from the mouth 
of the river Oroonoko to Guiana, and onwards to St. 
Martha. He told me that up a great way beyond the 
moon, that was, beyond the setting of the moon, which 
must be W. from their country, there dwelt white- 
bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great 
whiskers, which I mentioned before; and that they 
had killed much mans, that was his word; by all 
which I understood he meant the Spaniards, whose 
cruelties in America had been spread over the whole 
countries, and was remembered by all the nations 
from father to son. 

I inquired if he could tell me how I might come 
from this island and get among those white men. He 
told me, “ Yes, yes, I might go in two canoe.” I could 
not understand what he meant, or make him describe 
to me what he meant by two canoe; till at last, with 
great difficulty, I found he meant it must be in a 
large great boat, as big as two canoes. 

This part of Friday’s discourse began to relish with 
me very well; and from this time I entertained some 
hopes that, one time or other, I might find an oppor- 
tunity to make my escape from this place, and that 
this poor savage might be a means to help me to do it. 

During the long time that Friday had now been 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


182 

with me, and that he began to speak to me, and 
understand me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation 
of religious knowledge in his mind; particularly I 
asked him one time, Who made him? The poor 
creature did not understand me at all, so I took it 
by another handle, and asked him who made the sea, 
the ground we walked on, and the hills and woods? 
He told me it was one old Benamuckee, that lived 
beyond all. He could describe nothing of this great 
person, but that he was very old, much older, he said, 
than the sea or the land, than the moon or the stars. 
I asked him then, if this old person had made all 
things, why did not all things worship him? He 
looked very grave, and with a perfect look of innocence 
said, “ All things do say 0 to him.” I asked him if 
the people who die in his country went away any- 
where ? He said, “ Yes, they all went to Benamuckee.” 
Then I asked him whether these they eat up went 
thither too? He said “ Yes.” 

From these things I began to instruct him in the 
knowledge of the true God. I told him that the great 
Maker of all things lived up there, pointing up towards 
heaven; that He governs the world by the same power 
and providence by which He had made it; that He 
was omnipotent, could do everything for us, give 
everything to us, take everything from us; and thus, 
by degrees, I opened* his eyes. He listened with great 
attention, and received with pleasure the notion of 
Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of the manner 
of making our prayers to God, and His being able to 
hear us, even into heaven. He told me one day that 
if our God could hear us up beyond the sun, He must 
needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee, who 
lived but a little way off, and yet could not hear till

they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt 
to speak to him. I asked him if he ever went thither 
to speak to him? He said, No; they never went that 
were young men ; none went thither but the old men, 
whom he called their Oowokakee, that is, as I made 
him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy; and 
that they went to say 0 (so he called saying prayers), 
and then came back, and told them what Benamuckee 
said. By this I observed that there is priestcraft even 
amongst the most blinded, ignorant pagans in the 
world; and the policy of making a secret religion in 
order to preserve the veneration of the people to the 
clergy is not only to be found in the Roman, but 
perhaps among all religions in the world, even among 
the most brutish and barbarous savages. 

I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man 
Friday, and told him that the pretence of their old 
men going up to the mountains to say O to their god 
Benamuckee was a cheat, and their bringing word 
from thence what he said was much more so; that 
if they met with any answer, or spoke with any one 
there, it must be with an evil spirit; and then I 
entered into a long discourse with him about the devil, 
the original of him, his rebellion against God, his 
enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting himself 
up in the dark parts of the world to be worshipped 
instead of God, and as God, and the many stratagems 
he made use of to delude mankind to their min ; how 
he had a secret access to our passions and to our 
affections, to adapt his snares so to our inclinations, 
as to cause us even to be our own tempters, and to 
run upon our destruction by our own choice. 

I had been telling him how the devil was God’s 
enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his malice 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


184 

and skill to defeat the good designs of Providence, and 
to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the world, and the 
like. " Well/' says Friday, “ but you say God is so 
strong, so great; is He not much strong, much might 
as the devil ?” “ Yes, yes,” says I, " Friday, God is 
stronger than the devil; God is above the devil, and 
therefore we pray to God to tread him down under 
our feet, and enable us to resist his temptations, 
and quench his fiery darts.” “ But,” says he again, 
“if God much strong, much might as the devil, 
why God no kill the devil, so make him no more do 
wicked? ” 

I was strangely surprised at his question; and after 
all, though I was now an old man, yet I was but a 
young doctor, and ill enough qualified for a casuist, 
or a solver of difficulties ; and at first I could not tell 
what to say; so I pretended not to hear him, and 
asked him what he said ? But he was too earnest for 
an answer to forget his question, so that he repeated 
it in the very same broken words as above. By this 
time I had recovered myself a little, and I said, “ God 
will at last punish him severely; he is reserved for 
the judgment, and is to be cast into the bottomless 
pit, to dwell with everlasting fire.” This did not 
satisfy Friday; but he returns upon me, repeating 
my words, “ Reserve at last! me no understand; but 
why not kill the devil now ? not kill great ago ? ” 
“ You may as well ask me," said I, “ why God does 
not kill you and me, when we do wicked things here 
that offend Him; we are preserved to repent and be 
pardoned.” He muses awhile at this. " Well, well,” 
says he, mighty affectionately, “ that well; so you, I, 
devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all.” 

I therefore diverted the present discourse between 



LIFE WITH FRIDAY 


185 

me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon some 
sudden occasion of going out; then sending him for 
something a good way off, I seriously prayed to God 
that He would enable me to instruct savingly this 
poor savage, and would guide me to speak so to him 
from the Word of God as his conscience might be 
convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When 
he came again to me, I entered into a long discourse 
with him upon the subject of the redemption of man 
by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine of 
the Gospel preached from heaven, viz., of repentance 
towards God, and faith in our blessed Lord Jesus. 
I then explained to him as well as I could why our 
blessed Redeemer took not on Him the nature of 
angels, but the seed of Abraham; and how, for that 
reason, the fallen angels had no share in the redemp- 
tion ; that He came only to the lost sheep of the house 
of Israel, and the like. 

In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder 
of my time, and the conversation which employed the 
hours between Friday and I was such as made the 
three years which we lived there together perfectly 
and completely happy, if any such thing as complete 
happiness can be formed in a sublunary state. The 
savage was now a good Christian, a much better than 
I; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for 
it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted, 
restored penitents. We had here the Word of God to 
read, and no farther off from His Spirit to instruct 
than if we had been in England. 

As to all the disputes, wranglings, strife, and con- 
tention which has happened in the world about religion, 
whether niceties in doctrines, or schemes of Church 
government, they were all perfectly useless to us; as, 



i86 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 


for aught I can yet see, they have been to all the rest 
in the world. We had the sure guide to heaven, viz., 
the Word of God ; and we had, blessed be God, com- 
fortable views of the Spirit of God teaching and in- 
structing us by His Word, leading us into all truth, 
and making us both willing and obedient to the 
instruction of His Word; and I cannot see the least 
use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points 
in religion, which have made such confusions in the 
world, would have been to us if we could have obtained 
it. But I must go on with the historical part of things, 
and take every part in its order. 

After Friday and I became more intimately ac- 
quainted, and that he could understand almost all I 
said to him, and speak fluently, though in broken 
English, to me, I acquainted him with my own story, 
or at least so much of it as related to my coming into 
the place; how I had lived there, and how long. I 
let him into the mystery, for such it was to him, of 
gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot; 
I gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully delighted 
with, and I made him a belt, with a frog hanging to 
it, such as in England we wear hangers in ; and in the 
frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which 
was not only as good a weapon, in some cases, but 
much more useful upon other occasions. 

I described to him the country of Europe, and par- 
ticularly England, which I came from; how we lived, 
how we worshipped God, how we behaved to one 
another, and how we traded in ships to all parts of 
the world. I gave him an account of the wreck which 
I had been on board of, and showed him, as near as 
I could, the place where she lay; but she was all 
beaten in pieces before, and gone. 



LIFE WITH FRIDAY 


187 

I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost 
when we escaped, and which I could not stir with 
my whole strength then, but was now fallen almost 
all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood 
musing a great while, and said nothing. I asked him 
what it was he studied upon. At last says he, " Me see 
such boat like come to place at my nation.” 

I did not understand him a good while; but at last, 
when I had examined further into it, I understood by 
him that a boat such as that had been, came on shore 
upon the country where he lived; that is, as he ex- 
plained it, was driven thither by stress of weather. 
I presently imagined that some European ship must 
have been cast away upon their coast, and the boat 
might get loose and drive ashore; but was so dull, 
that I never once thought of men making escape from 
a wreck thither, much less whence they might come; 
so I only inquired after a description of the boat. 

Friday described the boat to me well enough; but 
brought me better to understand him when he added 
with some warmth, “ We save the white mans from 
drown.” Then I presently asked him if there was any 
white mans, as he called them, in the boat. “ Yes,” 
he said, “ the boat full of white mans.” I asked him 
how many. He told upon his fingers seventeen. I 
asked him then what became of them. He told me, 
“ They live, they dwell at my nation.” 

This put new thoughts into my head ; for I presently 
imagined that these might be the men belonging to 
the ship that was cast away in sight of my island, as I 
now call it; and who, after the ship was struck on the 
rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved them- 
selves in their boat, and were landed upon that wild 
shore among the savages. 



i88 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 


Upon this I inquired of him more critically what 
was become of them. He assured me they lived still 
there; that they had been there about four years; 
that the savages let them alone, and gave them 
victuals to live. I asked him how it came to pass they 
did not kill them, and eat them. He said, “ No, they 
make brother with them”; that is, as I understood 
him, a truce; and then he added, " They no eat mans 
but when make the war fight ”; that is to say, they 
never eat any men but such as come to fight with them 
and are taken in battle. 

It was after this some considerable time, that being 
on the top of the hill, at the east side of the island 
(from whence, as I have said, I had in a clear day 
discovered the main or continent of America), Friday, 
the weather being very serene, looks very earnestly 
towards the mainland, and, in a kind of surprise, falls 
a-jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was 
at some distance from him. I asked him what was 
the matter? “ O joy! ” says he, “ O glad! there see 
my country, there my nation! ” 

I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure 
appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his 
countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he 
had a mind to be in his own country again ; and this 
observation of mine put a great many thoughts into 
me, which made me at first not so easy about my new 
man Friday as I was before; and I made no doubt 
but that if Friday could get back to his own nation 
again, he would not only forget all his religion, but 
all his obligation to me ; and would be forward enough 
to give his countrymen an account of me, and come 
back perhaps with a hundred or two of them, and 
make a feast upon me, at which he might be as merry 



LIFE WITH FRIDAY 189 

as he used to be with those of his enemies, when they 
were taken in war. 

But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, 
for which I was very sorry afterwards. However, as 
my jealousy increased, and held me some weeks, 1 was 
a little more circumspect, and not so familiar and kind 
to him as before ; in which I was certainly in the wrong 
too, the honest, grateful creature having no thought 
about it but what consisted with the best principles, 
both as a religious Christian and as a grateful friend, 
as appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction. 

While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure 
I was every day pumping him, to see if he would 
discover any of the new thoughts which I suspected 
were in him; but I found everything he said was so 
honest and so innocent, that I could find nothing to 
nourish my suspicion; and, in spite of all my un- 
easiness, he made me at last entirely his own again, 
nor did he in the least perceive that I was uneasy, 
and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit. 

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather 
being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the con- 
tinent, I called to him, and said, “ Friday, do not 
you wish yourself in your own country, your own 
nation? ” “ Yes,” he said, “ I be much O glad to be 
at my own nation.” “ What would you do there? ” 
said I. “ Would you turn wild again, eat men's flesh 
again, and be a savage as you were before?” He 
looked full of concern, and shaking his head said, 
“ No, no; Friday tell them to live good; tell them to 
pray God; tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flesh, 
milk, no eat man again.” “ Why then,” said I to him, 
“ they will kill you.” He looked grave at that, and 
then said, “ No, they no kill me, they willing love 



190 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

learn.” He meant by this they would be willing to 
learn. He added, they learned much of the bearded 
mans that come in the boat. Then I asked him if he 
would go back to them? He smiled at that, and told 
me he could not swim so far. I told him I would make 
a canoe for him. He told me he would go, if I would 
go with him. " I go! ” says I; " why, they will eat 
me if I come there.” “ No, no,” says he, “ me make 
they no eat you; me make they much love you.” 
He meant, he would tell them how I had killed his 
enemies, and saved his life, and so he would make 
them love me. Then he told me, as well as he could, 
how kind they were to the seventeen white men, or 
bearded men, as he called them, who came on shore 
there in distress. 


CHAPTER XVI 

THE ISLAND PEOPLED 

From this time I confess I had a mind to venture 
over, and see if I could possibly join with these bearded 
men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards or Portu- 
guese; not doubting but, if I could, we might find 
some method to escape from thence, being upon the 
continent, and a good company together, better than 
I could from an island forty miles off the shore, and 
alone, without help. ' So, after some days, I took 
Friday to work again, by way of discourse, and told 
him I would give him a boat to go back to his own 
nation; and accordingly I carried him to my frigate, 
which lay on the other side of the island, and having 
cleared it of water, for I always kept it sunk in the 
water, I brought it out, showed it him, and we both 
went into it. 



THE ISLAND PEOPLED 


191 

I found he was a most dexterous fellow at managing 
it, would make it go almost as swift and fast again 
as I could. So when he was in I said to him, “ Well 
now, Friday, shall we go to your nation? ” He looked 
very dull at my saying so, which, it seems, was be- 
cause he thought the boat too small to go so far. I 
told him then I had a bigger; so the next day I went 
to the place where the first boat lay which I had made, 
but which I could not get into water. He said that 
was big enough; but then, as I had taken no care of 
it, and it had lain two or three and twenty years 
there, the sun had split and dried it, and it was in a 
manner rotten. Friday told me such a boat would 
do very well, and would carry “ much enough victual, 
drink, bread ”; that was his way of talking. 

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon 
my design of going over with him to the continent, 
that I told him we would go and make one as big as 
that, and he should go home in it. He answered not 
one word, but looked very grave and sad. I asked 
him what was the matter with him? He asked me 
again thus, “ Why you angry mad with Friday? what 
me done? ” I asked him what he meant. I told him 
I was not angry with him at all. “ No angry! no 
angry !” says he, repeating the words several times. 
" Why send Friday home away to my nation ?” 
“ Why,” says I, " Friday, did you not say you wished 
you were there? ” “ Yes, yes,” says he, " wish be 

both there, no wish Friday there, no master there 1 ” 
In a word, he would not think of going there without 
me. “ I go there, Friday? ” says I; “ what shall I 
do there? ” He turned very quick upon me at this: 
“ You do great deal much good,” says he; “you 
teach wild mans to be good, sober, tame mans; you 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


192 

tell them know God, pray God, and live new life." 
"Alas! Friday," says I, "thou knowest not what 
thou sayest. I am but an ignorant man myself." 
" Yes, yes," says he, " you teachee me good, you 
teachee them good." " No, no, Friday," says I, " you 
shall go without me ; leave me here to live by myself, 
as I did before." He looked confused again at that 
word, and running to one of the hatchets which he 
used to wear, he takes it up hastily, comes and gives 
it me. " What must I do with this? " says I to him. 
" You take kill Friday," said he. " What must I kill 
you for? " said I again. He returns very quick, 
" What you send Friday away for? Take kill Friday, 
no send Friday away." This he spoke so earnestly, 
that I saw tears stand in his eyes. In a word, I so 
plainly discovered the utmost affection in him to me, 
and a firm resolution in him, that I told him then, 
and often after, that I would never send him away 
from me if he was willing to stay with me. 

Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a 
settled affection to me, and that nothing should part 
him from me, so I found all the foundation of his 
desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent 
affection to the people, and his hopes of my doing 
them good; a thing which, as I had no notion of 
myself, so I had not the least thought or intention 
or desire of undertaking it. But still I found a strong 
inclination to my attempting an escape, as above, 
founded on the supposition gathered from the dis- 
course, viz., that there were seventeen bearded men 
there; and, therefore, without any more delay I 
went to work with Friday to find out a great tree 
proper to fell, and make a large periagua, or canoe, 
to undertake the voyage. There were trees enough in 



THE ISLAND PEOPLED 193 

the island to have built a little fleet, not of periaguas 
and canoes, but even of good large vessels. But the 
main thing I looked at was, to get one so near the 
water that we might launch it when it was made, to 
avoid the mistake I committed at first. 

At last Friday pitched upon a tree, for I found he 
knew much better than I what kind of wood was 
fittest for it; nor can I tell, to this day, what wood 
to call the tree we cut down, except that it was very 
like the tree we call fustic, or between that and the 
Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour 
and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow or 
cavity of this tree out, to make it for a boat, but I 
showed him how rather to cut it out with tools ; which, 
after I had showed him how to use, he did very handily; 
and in about a month's hard labour we finished it, and 
made it very handsome; especially when, with our 
axes, which I showed him how to handle, we cut and 
hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat. After 
this, however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to get 
her along, as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers 
into the water; but when she was in, she would have 
carried twenty men with great ease. 

When she was in the water, and though she was so 
big, it amazed me to see with what dexterity, and 
how swift my man Friday would manage her, turn 
her, and paddle her along. So I asked him if he would, 
and if we might venture over in her. " Yes," he said, 
“ he venture over in her very well, though great blow 
wind." However, I had a farther design that he knew 
nothing of, and that was to make a mast and sail, 
and to fit her with an anchor and cable. As to a 
mast, that was easy enough to get ; so I pitched upon 
a straight young cedar tree, which I found near the 

G 



194 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

place, and which there was great plenty of in the 
island; and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and 
gave him directions how to shape and order it. But 
as to the sail, that was my particular care. I knew 
I had old sails, or rather pieces of old sails enough; 
but as I had had them now twenty-six years by me, 
and had not been very careful to preserve them, not 
imagining that I should ever have this kind of use 
for them, I did not doubt but they were all rotten, 
and, indeed, most of them were so. However, I found 
two pieces which appeared pretty good, and with 
these I went to work, and with a great deal of pains, 
and awkward tedious stitching (you may be sure) for 
want of needles, I, at length, made a three-comer ugly 
thing, like what we call in England a shoulder-of- 
mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little 
short sprit at the top, such as usually our ships' long- 
boats sail with, and such as I best know how to 
manage; because it was such a one as I had to the 
boat in which I made my escape from Barbary, as 
related in the first part of my story. 

I was near two months performing this last work, 
viz., rigging and fitting my mast and sails; for I 
finished them very complete, making a small stay, 
and a sail, or foresail, to it, to assist, if we should turn 
to windward; and, which was more than all, I fixed 
a rudder to the stem of her to steer with ; and though 
I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as I knew the 
usefulness, and even necessity, of such a thing, I 
applied myself with so much pains to do it, that at 
last I brought it to pass ; though, considering the many 
dull contrivances I had for it that failed, I think it 
cost me almost as much labour as making the boat. 

After all this was done too, I had my man Friday 



THE ISLAND PEOPLED 195 

to teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my 
boat; for though he knew very well how to paddle 
a canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail and 
a nidder; and was the most amazed when he saw me 
work the boat to and again in the sea by the rudder, 
and how the sail jibbed, and filled this way, or that 
way, as the course we sailed changed; I say, when 
he saw this, he stood like one astonished and amazed. 
However, with a little use I made all these things 
familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, except 
that as to the compass I could make him understand 
very little of that. On the other hand, as there was 
very little cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs 
in those parts, there was the less occasion for a compass, 
seeing the stars were always to be seen by night, and 
the shore by day, except in the rainy seasons, and then 
nobody cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea. 

I was now entered on the seven and twentieth year 
of my captivity in this place; though the three last 
years that I had this creature with me ought rather 
to be left out of the account, my habitation being quite 
of another kind than in all the rest of the time. I kept 
the anniversary of my landing here with the same 
thankfulness to God for His mercies as at first; and 
if I had such cause of acknowledgment at first, I had 
much more so now, having such additional testimonies 
of the care of Providence over me, and the great hopes 
I had of being effectually and speedily delivered; for 
I had an invincible impression upon my thoughts that 
my deliverance was at hand, and that I should not 
be another year in this place. However, I went on 
with my husbandry, digging, planting, fencing, as 
usual. I gathered and cured my grapes, and did 
every necessary thing as before. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


196 

The rainy season was, in the meantime, upon me, 
when I kept more within doors than at other times; 
so I had stowed our new vessel as secure as we could, 
bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in 
the beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship; and 
hauling her up to the shore at high-water mark, I 
made my man Friday dig a little dock, just big enough 
to hold her, and just deep enough to give her water 
enough to float in; and then, when the tide was out, 
we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep 
the water out; and so she lay dry, as to .the tide, 
from the sea; and to keep the rain off, we laid a great 
many boughs of trees, so thick, that she was as well 
thatched as a house ; and thus we waited for the month 
of November and December, in which I designed to 
make my adventure. 

When the settled season began to come in, as the 
thought of my design returned with the fair weather, 
I was preparing daily for the voyage; and the first 
thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of pro- 
visions, being the stores for our voyage ; and intended, 
in a week or a fortnight’s time, to open the dock, and 
launch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon 
something of this kind, when I called to Friday, and 
bid him go to the sea-shore and see if he could find 
a turtle, or tortoise, a thing which we generally got 
once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well as the 
flesh. Friday had not been long gone when he came 
running back, and flew over my outer wall, or fence, 
like one that felt not the ground, or the steps he set 
his feet on; and before I had time to speak to him, 
he cries out to me, “ O master! O master I O sorrow! 
0 bad! ” “ What’s the matter, Friday? ” says I. “ 0 
yonder, there,” says he, “ one, two, three canoe! one. 



THE ISLAND PEOPLED 197 

two, three !" By his way of speaking, I concluded 
there were six; but, on inquiry, I found it was but 
three. “ Well, Friday/’ says I, “ do not be frighted/' 
So I heartened him up as well as I could. However, 
I saw the poor fellow was most terribly scared; for 
nothing ran in his head but that they were come to 
look for him, and would cut him in pieces, and eat 
him; and the poor fellow trembled so, that I scarce 
knew what to do with him. I comforted him as well 
as I could, and told him I was in as much danger 
as he, and that they would eat me as well as him. 
“ But," says I, “ Friday, we must resolve to fight them. 
Can you fight, Friday? " "Me shoot," says he; “ but 
there come many great number." " No matter for 
that," said I again, “ our guns will fright them that 
we do not kill." So I asked him whether, if I resolved 
to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by me, 
and do just as I bid him. He said, “ Me die when you 
bid die, master." So I went and fetched a good dram 
of rum, and gave him ; for I had been so good a husband 
of my rum, that I had a great deal left. When he had 
drank it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces, 
which we always carried, and load them with large 
swan-shot, as big as small pistol-bullets. Then I took 
four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs and five 
small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with 
a brace of bullets each. I hung my great sword, as 
usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet. 

When I had" thus prepared myself, I took my per- 
spective glass, and went up to the side of the hill to 
see what I could discover; and I found quickly, by 
my glass, that there were one and twenty savages, 
three prisoners, and three canoes, and that their whole 
business seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


198 

these three human bodies; a barbarous feast indeed, 
but nothing more than, as I had observed, was usual 
with them. 

I observed also that they were landed, not where 
they had done when Friday made his escape, but 
nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and 
where a thick wood came close almost down to the 
sea. This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand 
these wretches came about, filled me with such indig- 
nation, that I came down again to Friday, and told 
him I was resolved to go down to them, and kill them 
all, and asked him if he would stand by me. He was 
now gotten over his fright, and his spirits being a little 
raised with the dram I had given him, he was very 
cheerful, and told me, as before, he would die when 
I bid die. 

In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the arms 
which I had charged, as before, between us. I gave 
Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns 
upon his shoulder; and I took one pistol, and the other 
three myself, and in this posture we marched out. I 
took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave 
Friday a large bag with more powder and bullet; and 
as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, 
and not to stir, or shoot, or do anything, till I bid 
him, and in the meantime not to speak a word. In 
this posture I fetched a compass to my right hand of 
near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get 
into the wood, so that I might come within shot of 
them before I should be discovered, which I had seen, 
by my glass, it was easy to do. 

While I was making this march, my former thoughts 
returning, I began to abate my resolution. I do not 
mean that I entertained any fear of their number; 



THE ISLAND PEOPLED 199 

for as they were naked, unarmed wretches, *tis certain 
I was superior to them; nay, though I had been alone. 
But it occurred to my thoughts what call, what 
occasion, much less what necessity, I was in to go 
and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had 
neither done or intended me any wrong; that when- 
ever God thought fit, He would take the cause into 
His own hands, and by national vengeance, punish 
them, as a people, for national crimes; but that, in 
the meantime, it was none of my business; that, it 
was true, Friday might justify it, because he was a 
declared enemy, and in a state of war with those very 
particular people, and it was lawful for him to attack 
them; but I could not say the same with respect to 
me. These things were so warmly pressed upon my 
thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I 
would only go and place myself near them, that I 
might observe their barbarous feast, and that I would 
act then as God should direct; but that, unless some- 
thing offered that was more a call to me than yet 
I knew of, I would not meddle with them. 

With this resolution I entered the wood, and with 
all possible wariness and silence, Friday following close 
at my heels, I marched till I came to the skirt of the 
wood, on the side which was next to them ; only that 
one comer of the wood lay between me and them. 
Here I called softly to Friday, and showing him a 
great tree, which was just at the comer of the wood, 
I bade him go to the tree and bring me word if he 
could see there plainly what they were doing. He did 
so, and came immediately back to me, and told me 
they might be plainly viewed there; that they were 
all about their fire, eating the flesh of one of their 
prisoners, and that another lay bound upon the sand, 



200 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

a little from them, which, he said, they would kill 
next; and, which fired all the very soul within me, 
he told me it was not one of their nation, but one of 
the bearded men, whom he had told me of, that came 
to their country in the boat. I was filled with horror 
at the very naming the white, bearded man; and 
going to the tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white 
man, who lay upon the beach of the sea, with his 
hands and feet tied with flags, or things like rushes, 
and that he was an European, and had clothes on. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond 
it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the place 
where I was, which, by going a little way about, I 
saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then 
I should be within half shot of them; so I withheld 
my passion, though I was indeed enraged to the 
highest degree; and going back about twenty paces, 
I got behind some bushes, which held all the way till 
I came to the other tree; and then I came to a little 
rising ground, which gave me a full view of them, at 
the distance of about eighty yards. 

I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the 
dreadful wretches sat upon the ground, all close 
huddled together, and had just sent the other two to 
butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps 
limb by limb, to .their fire; and they were stooped 
down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to 
Friday: “ Now, Friday/' said I, " do as I bid thee." 
Friday said he would. “ Then, Friday," says I, “ do 
exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing." So I set 
down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon 
the ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with 
the other musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding 
him do the like. Then asking him if he was ready, he 



THE ISLAND PEOPLED 


201 


said, “ Yes,” “ Then fire at them,” said I; and the 
same moment I fired also. 

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on 
the side that he shot he killed two of them, and 
wounded three more; and on my side I killed one, 
and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in a 
dreadful consternation ; and all of them who were not 
hurt jumped up upon their feet, but did not immedi- 
ately know which way to run, or which way to look, 
for they knew not from whence their destruction 
came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me, that, as I 
had bid him, he might observe what I did; so as 
soon as the first shot was made I threw down the 
piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and Friday did 
the like. He seds me cock and present ; he did the same 
again. “Are you ready, Friday?” said I. “Yes,” 
says he. “ Let fly, then,” says I, “ in the name of 
God I ” and with that I fired again among the amazed 
wretches, and so did Friday; and as our pieces were 
now loaded with what I called swan-shot, or small 
pistol-bullets, we found only two drop, but so many 
were wounded, that they ran about yelling and scream- 
ing like mad creatures, all bloody, and miserably 
wounded most of them; whereof three more fell 
quickly after, though not quite dead. 

“ Now, Friday,” says I, laying down the discharged 
pieces, and taking up the musket which was yet loaded, 
“ follow me,” says I, which he did with a great deal 
of courage; upon which I rushed out of the wood, 
and showed myself, and Friday close at my foot. As 
soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud 
as I could, and bade Friday do so too; and running 
as fast as I could, which, by the way, was not very 
fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I made directly 



202 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 


towards the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying 
upon the beach, or shore, between the place where 
they sat and the sea. The two butchers, who were 
just going to work with him, had left him at the sur- 
prise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible fright to 
the seaside, and had jumped into a canoe, and three 
more of the rest made the same way. I turned to 
Friday, and bid him step forwards and fire at them. 
He understood me immediately, and running about 
forty yards, to be near them, he shot at them, and 
I thought he had killed them all, for I saw them all 
fall of a heap into the boat; though I saw two of 
them up again quickly. However, he killed two of 
them, and wounded the third, so that he lay down in 
the bottom of the boat as if he had been dead. 

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out 
my knife and cut the flags that bound the poor victim ; 
and loosing his hands and feet, I lifted him up, and 
asked him in the Portuguese tongue what he was. He 
answered in Latin, Christianus ; but was so weak and 
faint, that he could scarce stand or speak. I took 
my bottle out of my pocket and gave it him, making 
signs that he should drink, which he did ; and I gave 
him a piece of bread, which he ate. Then I asked 
him what countryman he was ; and he said, Espagniole ; 
and being a little recovered, let me know, by all the 
signs he could possibly make, how much he was in 
my debt for his deliverance. “ Seignior,” said I, with 
as much Spanish as I could make up, “ we will talk 
afterwards, but we must fight now. If you have any 
strength left, take this pistol and sword, and lay about 
you.” He took them very thankfully, and no soonei 
had he the arms in his hands but, as if they had put 
new vigour into him, he flew upon his murderers like 



THE ISLAND PEOPLED 


203 

a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant ; 
for the truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, 
so the poor creatures were so much frighted with the 
noise of our pieces, that they fell down for mere amaze- 
ment and fear, and had no more power to attempt 
their own escape, than their flesh had to resist our 
shot ; and that was the case of those five that Friday 
shot at in the boat ; for as three of them fell with the 
hurt they received, so the other two fell with the 
fright. 

I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, 
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I had 
given the Spaniard my pistol and sword. So I called 
to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree from 
whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which lay 
there that had been discharged, which he did with 
great swiftness; and then giving him my musket, I 
sat down myself to load all the rest again, and bade 
them come to me when they wanted. While I was 
loading these pieces, there happened a fierce engage- 
ment between the Spaniard and one of the savages, 
who made at him with one of their great wooden 
swords, the same weapon that was to have killed him 
before if I had not prevented it. The Spaniard, who 
was as bold and as brave as could be imagined, though 
weak, had fought this Indian a good while, and had 
cut him two great wounds on his head ; but the savage 
being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with him, had 
thrown him down, being faint, and was wringing my 
sword out of his hand, when the Spaniard, though 
undermost, wisely quitting the sword, drew the pistol 
from his girdle, shot the savage through the body, 
and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was 
running to help him, could come near him. 



204 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

Friday being now left to his liberty, pursued the 
flying wretches with no weapon in his hand but his 
hatchet; and with that he despatched those three 
who, as I said before, were wounded at first, and 
fallen, and all the rest he could come up with ; and the 
Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him one of 
the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of the 
savages, and wounded them both; but as he was not 
able to run, they both got from him into the wood, 
where Friday pursued them, and killed one of them; 
but the other was too nimble for him, and though he 
was wounded, yet had plunged himself into the sea 
and swam with all his might off to those two who were 
left in the canoe; which three in the canoe, with one 
wounded, who we know not whether he died or no, 
were all that escaped out hands of one and twenty. 
The account of the rest is as follows : 

3 killed at our first shot from the tree. 

2 killed at the next shot. 

2 killed by Friday in the boat. 

2 killed by ditto, of those at first wounded. 

i killed by ditto in the wood. 

3 killed by the Spaniard. 

4 killed, being found dropped here and there of their 

wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of 
them. 

4 escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not 
dead. 

21 in all. 

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out 
of gun-shot; and though Friday made two or three 
shots at them, I did not find that he hit any of them. 



THE ISLAND PEOPLED 205 

Friday would fain have had me take one of their 
canoes, and pursue them; and, indeed, I was very 
anxious about their escape, lest carrying the news 
home to their people they should come back perhaps 
with two or three hundred of their canoes, and devour 
us by mere multitude. So I consented to pursue them 
by sea, and running to one of their canoes I jumped 
in, and bade Friday follow me. But when I was in the 
canoe, 1 was surprised to find another poor creature 
lie there alive, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard 
was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not 
knowing what the matter was; for he had not been 
able to look up over the side of the boat, he was tied 
so hard, neck and heels, and had been tied so long, 
that he had really but little life in him. 

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which 
they had bound him with, and would have helped him 
up; but he could not stand or speak, but groaned 
most piteously, believing, it seems, still that he was 
only unbound in order to be killed. 

When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him, 
and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out my 
bottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram; which, 
with the news of his being delivered, revived him, and 
he sat up in the boat. But when Friday came to hear 
him speak, and look in his face, it would have moved 
any one to tears to have seen how Friday kissed him, 
embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, 
jumped about, danced, sung; then cried again, wrung 
his hands, beat his own face and head, and then sung 
and jumped about again, like a distracted creature. 
It was a good while before I could make him speak 
to me, or tell me what was the matter; and when he 
came a little to himself, he told me that it was his father. 



206 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 


It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to 
see what ecstasy and filial affection had worked in 
this poor savage at the sight of his father, and of his 
being delivered from death; nor, Indeed, can I describe 
half the extravagancies of his affection after this; for 
he went into the boat, and out of the boat, a great 
many times. When he went in to him, he would sit 
down by him, open his breast, and hold his father's 
head close to his bosom, half-an-hour together, to 
nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles, which 
were numbed and stiff with the binding, and- chafed 
and rubbed them with his hands; and I, perceiving 
what the case was, gave him some rum out of my 
bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal 
of good. 

This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe 
with the other savages, who were now gotten almost 
out of sight ; and it was happy for us that we did not, 
for it blew so hard within two hours after, and before 
they could be gotten a quarter of their way, and con- 
tinued blowing so hard all night, and that from the 
north-west, which was against them, that I could not 
suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached 
to their own coast. 

But to return to Friday. He was so busy about his 
father, that I could not find in my heart to take him 
off for some time; -but after I thought he could leave 
him a little, I called him to me, and he came jumping 
and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme. 
Then I asked him if he had given his father any bread. 
He shook his head, and said, “ None; ugly dog eat all 
up self." So I gave him a cake of bread out of a little 
pouch I carried on purpose. I also gave him a dram 
for himself, but he would not taste it, but carried it 



THE ISLAND PEOPLED 207 

to his father. I had in my pocket also two or three 
bunches of my raisins, so I gave him a handful of them 
for his father. He had no sooner given his father these 
raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat and run 
away, as if he had been bewitched, he ran at such a 
rate; for he was the swiftest fellow of his foot that 
ever I saw. I say, he run at such a rate, that he was 
out of sight as it were, in an instant; and though I 
called, and hallooed too, after him, it was all one, away 
he went ; and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come 
back again, though not so fast as he went ; and as he 
came nearer I found his pace was slacker, because he 
had something in his hand. 

When he came up to me, I found he had been quite 
home for an earthern jug, or pot, to bring his father 
some fresh water, and that he had got two more cakes 
or loaves of bread. The bread he gave me, but the 
water he carried to his father. However as I was very 
thirsty too, I took a little sup of it. This water revived 
his father more than all the rum or spirits I had given 
him, for he was just fainting with thirst. 

When his father had drank, I called him to know 
if there was any water left. He said “ Yes and I 
bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in as 
much want of it as his father; and I sent one of the 
cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard too, who 
was indeed very weak, and was reposing himself 
upon a green place under the shade of a tree; and 
whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much 
swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied with. 
When I saw that upon Friday's coming to him with 
the water he sat up and drank, and took the bread, 
and began to eat, I went to him, and gave him a 
handful of raisins. He looked up in my face with all 



208 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could 
appear in any countenance; but was so weak, not- 
withstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight, 
that he could not stand upon his feet. He tried to do 
it two or three times, but was really not able, his 
ankles were so swelled and so painful to him; so I 
bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his ankles, 
and bathe them with rum, as he had done his father's. 

I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two 
minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was here, 
turned his head about to see if his father was in the 
same place and posture as he left him sitting; and 
at last he found he was not to be seen; at which he 
started up, and without speaking a word, flew with 
that swiftness to him, that one could scarce perceive 
his feet to touch the ground as he went. But when 
he came, he only found he had laid himself down to 
ease his limbs; so Friday came back to me presently 
and I then spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help 
him up, if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then 
he should carry him to our dwelling, where I would 
take care of him. But Friday, a lusty, strong fellow, 
took the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and carried 
him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon 
the side or gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the 
inside of it, and then lifted him quite in, and set him 
close to his father;* and presently stepping out again, 
launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore 
faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty 
hard too. So he brought them both safe into our creek 
and leaving them in the boat, runs away to fetch the 
other canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to him, and 
asked him whither he went. He told me, “ Go fetch 
more boat." So away he went like the wind, for sure 



THE SOCIAL LIFE 209 

never man or horse ran like him ; and he had the other 
canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by land ; 
so he wafted me over, and then went to help our new 
guests out of the boat, which he did; but they were 
neither of them able to walk, so that poor Friday 
knew not what to do. 

To remedy this I went to work in my thoughts, 
and calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the 
bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind of 
hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried 
them up both together upon it between us. But when 
we got them to the outside of our wall, or fortification, 
we were at a worse loss than before, for it was impossible 
to get them over, and I was resolved not to break it 
down. So I set to work again; and Friday and I, in 
about two hours' time, made a very handsome tent, 
covered with old sails, and above that with boughs 
of trees, being in the space without our outward fence, 
and between that and the grove of young wood which 
I had planted; and here we made them two beds of 
such things as I had, viz., of good rice-straw, with 
blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to cover 
them, on each bed. 


CHAPTER XVII 

THE SOCIAL LIFE 

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself 
very rich in subjects; and it was a merry reflection, 
which I frequently made, how like a king I looked. 
First of all, the whole country was my own mere 
property, so that I had an undoubted right of dominion. 
Secondly, my people were perfectly subjected, I was 



210 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

absolute lord and lawgiver; they all owed their lives 
to me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there 
had been occasion of it, for me. It was remarkable, 
too, we had but three subjects, and they were of three 
different religions. My man Friday was a Protestant, 
his father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard 
was a Papist. However, I allowed liberty of conscience 
throughout my dominions. But this is by the way. 

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued 
prisoners, and given them shelter and a place to rest 
them upon, I began to think of making some provision 
for them; and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday 
to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out 
of my particular flock, to be killed ; when I cut off the 
hinder quarter, and chopping it into small pieces, 
I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing, and made 
them a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and 
broth, having put some barley and rice also into the 
broth; and as I cooked it without doors, for I made 
no fire within my inner wall, so I carried it all into the 
new tent, and having set a table there for them, I sat 
down and ate my own dinner also with them, and as 
well as I could cheered them, and encouraged them; 
Friday being my interpreter, especially to his father, 
and, indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard 
spoke the language of the savages pretty well. 

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered 
Friday to take one of the canoes and go and fetch our 
muskets and other firearms, which, for want of time, 
we had left upon the place of battle; and the next 
day I ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of 
the savages, which lay open to the sun, and would 
presently be offensive; and I also ordered him to 
bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast. 



THE SOCIAL LIFE 


2 1 1 


which I knew were pretty much, and which I could 
not think of doing myself; nay, I could not bear to 
see them, if I went that way. All which he punctually 
performed, and defaced the very appearance of the 
savages being there; so that when I went again I 
could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by the 
comer of the wood pointing to the place. 

I then began to enter into a little conversation with 
my two new subjects ; and first, I set Friday to enquire 
of his father what he thought of the escape of the 
savages in that canoe, and whether we might expect 
a return of them, with a power too great for us to 
resist. His first opinion was, that the savages in the 
boat never could live out the storm which blew that 
night they went off, but must, of necessity, be drowned, 
or driven south to those other shores, where they were 
as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if 
they were cast away. But as to what they would do 
if they came safe on shore, he said he knew not; but 
it was his opinion that they were so dreadfully frighted 
with the manner of their being attacked, the noise, and 
the fire, that he believed they would tell their people 
they were all killed by thunder and lightning, not by 
the hand of man ; and that the two which appeared, 
viz., Friday and me, were two heavenly spirits, or furies, 
come down to destroy them, and not men with weapons. 
This, he said, he knew, because he heard them aU cry 
out so in their language to one another; for it was 
impossible to them to conceive that a man could dart 
fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance without 
lifting up the hand, as was done now. And this old 
savage was in the right ; for, as I understood since by 
other hands, the savages never attempted to go over 
to the island afterwards. They were so terrified with 



212 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 


the accounts given by those four men (for, it seems, 
they did escape the sea), that they believed whoever 
went to that enchanted island would be destroyed with 
fire from the gods. 

This, however, I knew not, and therefore was under 
continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept 
always upon my guard, me and all my army; for as 
we were now four of us, I would have ventured upon a 
hundred of them, fairly in the open field, at any time. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, 
the fear of their coming wore off, and I began to take 
my former thoughts of a voyage to the main into con- 
sideration; being likewise assured, by Friday's father, 
that I might depend upon good usage from their nation, 
on his account, if I would go. 

But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had 
a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I 
understood that there were sixteen more of his country- 
men and Portuguese who, having been cast away, and 
made their escape to that side, lived there at peace, 
indeed, with the savages, but were very sore put to it 
for necessaries, and indeed for life. I asked him all the 
particulars of their voyage, and found they were a 
Spanish ship bound from the Rio de la Plata to the 
Havana, being directed to leave their loading there, 
which was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back 
what European goods they could meet with there; 
that they had five Portuguese seamen on board, whom 
they took out of another wreck; that five of their 
own men were drowned when the first ship was lost, 
and that these escaped, through infinite dangers and 
hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal 
coast, where they expected to have been devoured 
every moment. 



THE SOCIAL LIFE 213 

He told me they had some arms with them, but 
they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither 
powder or ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled 
all their powder but a little, which they used, at their 
first landing, to provide themselves some food. 

I asked him what he thought would become of them 
there, and if they had formed no design of making any 
escape? He said they had many consultations about 
it; but that having neither vessel, or tools to build 
one, or provisions of any kind, their councils always 
ended in tears and despair. 

I asked him how he thought they would receive a 
proposal from me, which might tend towards an 
escape; and whether, if they were all here, it might 
not be done? I told him with freedom, I feared 
mostly their treachery and ill usage of me if I put 
my life in their hands; for that gratitude was no 
inherent virtue in the nature of man, nor did men 
always square their dealings by the obligations they 
had received, so much as they did by the advantages 
they expected. I told him it would be very hard that 
I should be the instrument of their deliverance, and 
that they should afterwards make me their prisoner 
in New Spain, where an Englishman was certain to 
be made a sacrifice, what necessity or what accident 
soever brought him thither; and that I had rather 
be delivered up to the savages, and be devoured alive, 
than fall into the merciless claws of the priests, and 
be carried into the Inquisition. I added, that other- 
wise I was persuaded, if they were all here,' we might, 
with so many hands, build a bark large enough to carry 
us all away, either to the Brazils, southward, or to 
the islands, or Spanish coast, northward; but that if; 
in requital, they should, when I had put weapons into 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


214 

their hands, carry me by force among their own people, 
I might be ill used for my kindness to them, and make 
my case worse than it was before. 

He answered, with a great deal of candour and 
ingenuity, that their condition was so miserable, and 
they were so sensible of it, that he believed they 
would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly 
that should contribute to their deliverance ; and that, 
if I pleased, he would go to them with the old man, 
and discourse with them about it, and return again, and 
bring me their answer; that he would make conditions 
with them upon their solemn oath that they should 
be absolutely under my leading, as their commander 
and captain; and that they should swear upon the 
holy sacraments and the gospel to be true to me, and 
to go to such Christian country as that I should agree 
to, and no other, and to be directed wholly and abso- 
lutely by my orders till they were landed safely in such 
country as I intended; and that he would bring a con- 
tract from them, under their hands, for that purpose. 

Then he told me he would first swear to me him- 
self, that he would never stir from me as long as he 
lived till I gave him orders; and that he would take 
my side to the last drop of his blood, if there should 
happen the least breach of faith among his countrymen. 

He told me they were all of them very civil, honest 
men, and they were under the greatest distress imagin- 
able, having neither weapons or clothes, or any food, 
but at the mercy and discretion of the savages; out 
of all hopes of ever returning to their own country; 
and that he was sure, if I would undertake their 
relief, they would live and die by me. 

Upon these assurances I resolved to venture to relieve 
them, if possible, and to send the old savage and this 



THE SOCIAL LIFE 215 

Spaniard over to them to treat. But when we had 
gotten all things in a readiness to go, the Spaniard 
himself started an objection, which had so much 
prudence in it on one hand, and so much sincerity on 
the other hand, that I could not but be very well satis- 
fied in it, and by his advice put off the deliverance of 
his comrades for at least half a year. The case was thus. 

He had been with us now about a month, during 
which time I had let him see in what manner I had 
provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my 
support; and he saw evidently what stock of corn 
and rice I had made up; which, as it was more than 
sufficient for myself, so it was not sufficient, at least 
without good husbandry, for my family, now it was 
increased to number four; but much less would it be 
sufficient if his countrymen, who were, as he said, 
fourteen, still alive, should come over; and least of 
all would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if we 
should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian 
colonies of America. So he told me he thought it would 
be more advisable to let him and the two others dig 
and cultivate some more land, as much as I could 
spare seed to sow; and that we should wait another 
harvest, that we might have a supply of com for his 
countrymen when they should come ; for want might 
be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to think 
themselves delivered, otherwise than out of one 
difficulty into another. “ You know,” says he, “ the 
children of Israel, though they rejoiced at first for 
their being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even 
against God Himself, that delivered them, when they 
came to want bread in the wilderness.” 

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so 
good, that I could not but be very well pleased with 



216 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his fidelity. 
So we fell to digging all four of us, as well as the 
wooden tools we were furnished with permitted; and 
in about a month’s time, by the end of which it was 
seed-time, we had gotten as much land cured and 
trimmed up as we sowed twenty-two bushels of barley 
on, and sixteen jars of rice; which was, in short, all 
the seed we had to spare; nor, indeed, did we leave 
ourselves barley sufficient for our own food for the 
six months that we had to expect our crop; that is 
to say, reckoning from the time we set our seed aside 
for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is six months 
in the ground in that country. 

Having now society enough, and our number being 
sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages, if they 
had come, unless their number had been very great, 
we went freely all over the island, wherever we found 
occasion ; and as here we had our escape or deliverance 
upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at least for me, 
to have the means of it out of mine. To this purpose 
I marked out several trees which I thought fit for our 
work, and I set Friday and his father to cutting them 
down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I 
imparted my thought on that affair, to oversee and 
direct their work. I showed them with what inde- 
fatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into single 
planks, and I caused them to do the like, till they 
had made about a dozen large planks of good oak, 
near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from 
two inches to four inches thick. What prodigious 
labour it took up, any one may imagine. 

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little 
flock of tame goats as much as I could; and to this 
purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard go out one 



THE SOCIAL LIFE 217 

day, and myself with Friday the next day, for we 
took our turns, and by this means we got above twenty 
young kids to breed up with the rest; for whenever 
we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and added them 
to our flock. But above all, the season for curing the 
grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious quantity 
to be hung up in the sun, that I believe, had we been 
at Alicant, where the raisins of the sun are cured, we 
could have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and these, 
with our bread, was a great part of our food, and very 
good living too, I assure you; for it is an exceeding 
nourishing food. 

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order. It 
was not the most plentiful increase I had seen in the 
island, but, however, it was enough to answer our end; 
for from our twenty-two bushels of barley we brought 
in and thrashed out above two hundred and twenty 
bushels, and the like in proportion of the rice ; which 
was store enough for our food to the next harvest, 
though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore 
with me; or if we had been ready for a voyage, it 
would very plentifully have victualled our ship to 
have carried us to any part of the world, that is to 
say, of America. 

When we had thus housed and secured our magazine 
of com, we fell to work to make more wicker-work, viz., 
great baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard 
was very handy and dexterous at this part, and often 
blamed me that I did jiot make some things for defence 
of this kind of work; but I saw no need of it. 

And now having a full supply of food for all the 
guests I expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over 
to the main, to see what he could do with those he 
had left behind him there. I gave him a strict charge 



2l8 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 


in writing not to bring any man with him who would 
not first swear, in the presence of himself and of the 
old savage, that he would no way injure, fight with, 
or attack the person he should find in the island, 
who was so kind to send for them in order to their 
deliverance; but that they would stand by and defend 
him against all such attempts, and wherever they went 
would be entirely under and subjected to his commands, 
and that this should be put in writing, and signed with 
their hands. How we were to have this done, when I 
knew they had neither pen or ink, that indeed was a 
question which we never asked. 

Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old 
savage, the father of Friday, went away in one of the 
canoes which they might be said to come in, or rather 
were brought in, when they came as prisoners to be 
devoured bv the savages. 

I gave each of them a musket, with a firelock on it, 
and about eight charges of powder and ball, charging 
them to be very good husbands of both, and not to 
use either of them but upon urgent occasion. 

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures 
used by me, in view of my deliverance, for now twenty- 
seven j'ears and some days. I gave them provisions 
of bread and of dried grapes sufficient for themselves 
for many days, and sufficient for all their countrymen 
for about eight days’ time; and wishing them agood 
voyage, I saw them go, agreeing with them about a 
signal they should hang out at their return, by which 
I should know them again, when they came back, at 
a distance, before they came on shore. 

They went away with a fair gale on the day that the 
moon was at full, by my account in the month of 
October; but as for an exact reckoning of days, after 



THE SOCIAL LIFE 219 

I had once lost it, I could never recover it again; nor 
had I kept even the number of years so punctually as 
to be sure that I was right, though as it proved, when 
I afterwards examined my account, I found I had kept 
a true reckoning of years. 

It was no less than eight days I had waited for them, 
when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened, 
of which the like has not perhaps been heard of in 
history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning, 
when my man Friday came running in to me, and called 
aloud, " Master, master, they are come, they are come I ” 

I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went out 
as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little 
grove, which, by the way, was by this time grown to 
be a very thick wood; I say, regardless of danger, I 
went without my arms, which was not my custom to 
do; but I was surprised when, turning my eyes to the 
sea, I presently saw ; a boat at about a league and half's 
distance standing in for the shore, with a shoulder- 
of -mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing 
pretty fair to bring them in ; also I observed presently 
that they did not come from that side which the shore 
lay on, but from the southernmost end of the island. 
Upon this I called Friday in, and bid him lie close 
for these were not the people we looked for, and that 
we might not know yet whether they were friends 
or enemies. 

In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective 
glass, to see what I could make of them; and having 
taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the 
hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of any- 
thing, and to take my view the plainer, without being 
discovered. 

I had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my eye 



220 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 


plainly discovered a ship lying at an achor at about 
two leagues and an half’s distance from me, south- 
south-east, but not above a league and an half from 
the shore. By my observation, it appeared plainly 
to be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be 
an English longboat. 

I cannot express the confusion I was in; though 
the joy of seeing a ship, and one who I had reason to 
believe was manned by my own countrymen, and 
consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe. 
But yet I had some secret doubts hung about me, I 
cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me keep 
upon my guard. In the first place, it occurred to me 
to consider what business an English ship could have 
in that part of the world, 'since it was not the way to or 
from any part of the world where the English had any 
traffic; and I knew there had been no storms to drive 
them in there as in distress; and that if they were 
English really, it was most probable that they were 
here upon no good design; and that I had better 
continue as I was, than fall into the hands of thieves 
and murderers. 


CHAPTER XVIII 

NEW ARRIVALS 

I had not kept ipyself long in this posture, but I saw 
the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked for a 
creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of landing. 
However, as they did not come quite far enough, 
they did not see the little inlet where I formerly 
landed my rafts ; but ran their boat on shore upon the 
beach, at about half a mile from me, which was very 
happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed 



NEW ARRIVALS 


221 


just, as I may say, at my door, and would soon have 
beaten me out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered 
me of all I had. 

When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied that 
they were Englishmen, at least most of them; one or 
two I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so. 
There were in all eleven men, whereof three of them 
I found were unarmed and, as I thought, bound; and 
when the first four or five of them were jumped on 
shore, they took those three out of the boat, as prisoners. 
One of the three I could perceive using the most passion- 
ate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, even to 
a kind of extravagance; and the other two, I could 
perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared 
concerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the first. 

I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew 
not what the meaning of it should be. Friday called 
out to me in English as well as he could, “ O master! 
you see English mans eat prisoner as well as savage 
mans." " Why," says I, " Friday, do you think they 
are a-going to eat them then? ” “ Yes," says Friday, 
“ they will eat them." “ No, no," says I, “ Friday, 
I am afraid they will murder them indeed, but you 
may be sure they will not eat them." 

All this while I had no thought of what the matter 
really was, but stood trembling with the horror of 
the sight, expecting every moment when the three 
prisoners should be killed ; nay, once I saw one of the 
villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the 
seamen call it, or sword, to strike one of the poor men; 
and I expected to see him fall every moment, at which all 
the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins. 

I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the 
savage that was gone with him; or that I had any 



222 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

way to have come undiscovered within shot of them, 
that I might have rescued the three men, for I saw 
no firearms they had among them; but it fell out to 
my mind another way. 

After I had observed the outrageous usage of the 
three men by the insolent seamen, I observed the 
fellows run scattering about the land, as if they wanted 
to see the country. I observed that the three other 
men had liberty to go also where they pleased; but 
they sat down all three upon the ground, very pensive, 
and looked like men in despair. 

This put me in mind of the first time when I came 
on shore, and began to look about me; how I gave 
myself over for lost; how wildly I looked round me; 
what dreadful apprehensions I had ; and how I lodged 
in the tree all night, for fear of being devoured by 
wild beasts. 

As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was 
to receive by the providential driving of the ship 
nearer the land by the storms and tide, by which I 
have since been so long nourished and supported; 
so these three poor desolate men knew nothing how 
certain of deliverance and supply they were, how near 
it was to them, and how effectually and really they 
were in a condition of safety, at the same time that 
they thought themselves lost, and their case desperate. 

It was just &t the top of high-water when these 
people came on shore; and while partly they stood 
parleying with the prisoners they brought, and partly 
while they rambled about to see what kind of a place 
they were in, they had carelessly stayed till the tide 
was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably 
away, leaving their boat aground. 

They had left two men in the boat, who, as I found 



NEW ARRIVALS 


223 

afterwards, having drank a little too much brandy, 
fell asleep. However, one of them waking sooner than 
the other, and finding the boat too fast aground for 
him to stir it, hallooed for the rest, who were straggling 
about, upon which they all soon came to the boat; 
but it was past all their strength to launch her, the 
boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side 
being a soft oozy sand, almost like a quicksand. 

In this condition, like true seamen, who are perhaps 
the least of all mankind given to forethought, they 
gave it over, and away they strolled about the country 
again; and I heard one of them say aloud to another, 
calling them off from the boat, " Why, let her alone. 
Jack, can't ye? she will float next tide ”; by which I 
was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what 
countrymen they were. 

All this while I kept myself very close, not once 
daring to stir out of my castle, any farther than to my 
place of observation near the top of the hill'; and very 
glad I was to think how well it was fortified. I knew 
it was no less than ten hours before the boat could be 
on float again, and by that time it would be dark, and 
I might be at more liberty to see their motions, and 
to hear their discourse, if they had any. 

In the meantime, I fitted myself up for a battle, as 
before, though with more caution, knowing I had to do 
with another kind of enemy than I had at first. I 
ordered Friday also, whom I had made an excellent 
marksman with his gun, to load himself with arms. 
I took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him three 
muskets. My figure, indeed, was very fierce. I had my 
formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I 
have mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols 
in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder. 



224 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made 
any attempt till it was dark; but about two o'clock, 
being the heat of the day, I found that, in short, they 
were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I 
thought, were laid down to sleep. The three poor 
distressed men, too anxious for their condition to get 
any sleep, were, however, set down under the shelter 
of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, 
and, as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest. 

Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, 
and learn something of their condition. Immediately 
I marched in the figure as above, my man Friday at a 
good distance behind me, as formidable for his arms 
as I, but not making quite so staring a spectre-like 
figure as I did. 

I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and 
then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to them 
in Spanish, " What are y e , gentlemen? ” 

They started up at the noise, but were ten times 
more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth 
figure that I made. They made no answer at all, but 
I thought I perceived them just going to fly from me, 
when I spoke to them in English, " Gentlemen," said 
I, "do not be surprised at me; perhaps you may have 
a friend near you, when you did not expect it." " He 
must be sent .directly from heaven then," said one 
of them very gravely to me, and pulling off his hat 
at the same time to me, “ for our condition is past the 
help of man." " All help is from heaven, sir," said I, 
" But can you put a stranger in the way how to help 
you, for you seem to be in some great distress? I saw 
you when you landed; and when you seemed to make 
applications to the brutes that came with you, I saw 
one of them lift up his sword to kill you." 



NEW ARRIVALS 225 

The poor man, with tears running down his face, 
and trembling, looking like one astonished, returned, 
“ Am I talking to God, or man? Is it a real man, or 
an angel? ” “ Be in no fear about that, sir/' said I. 
“ If God had sent an angel to relieve you, he would 
have come better clothed, and armed after another 
manner than you see me in. Pray lay aside your 
fears; I am a man, an Englishman and disposed to 
assist you, you see. I have one servant only; we 
have arms and ammunition ; tell us freely, can we serve 
you ? What is your case ? ” 

“ Our case,” said he, “ sir, is too long to tell you 
while our murderers are so near; but in short, sir, I 
was commander of that ship; my men have mutinied 
against me, they have been hardly prevailed on not 
to murder me; and at last have set me on shore in 
this desolate place, with these two men with me, one 
my mate, the other a passenger, where we expected 
to perish, believing the place to be uninhabited, and 
know not yet what to think of it.” 

“ Where are those brutes, your enemies? ” said I. 
“ Do you know where they are gone? ” “ There they 
lie, sir,” said he, pointing to a thicket of trees. “ My 
heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard 
you speak. If they have, they will certainly murder 
us all.” 

“ Have they any firearms? ” said I. He answered, 
they had only two pieces, and one which they left in 
the boat. “ Well then,” said I, “ leave the rest to 
me, I see they are all asleep ; it is an easy thing to kiK 
them all; but shall we rather take them prisoners? ” 
He told me there were two desperate villains among 
them that it was scarce safe to show any mercy to; 
but if they were secured, he believed all the rest would 

H 



226 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

return to their duty. I asked him which they were. 
He told me he could not at that distance describe 
them, but he would obey my orders in anything I 
would direct. “ Well/ 1 says I, “ let us retreat out of 
their view or hearing, lest they awake, and we will 
resolve further.' * So they willingly went back with 
me, till the woods covered us from them. 

“ Look you, sir,” said I, “ if I venture upon your 
deliverance, are you willing to make two conditions 
with me? ” He anticipated my proposals, by telling 
me that both he and the ship, if recovered, should be 
wholly directed and commanded by me in everything ; 
and if the ship was not recovered, he would live and 
die with me in what part of the world soever I would 
send him ; and the two other men said the same. 

“ Well,” says I, “ my conditions are but two. i. That 
while you stay on this island with me, you will not 
pretend to any authority here ; and if I put arms into 
your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them 
up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon 
this island; and in the meantime, be governed by my 
orders. 2. That if the ship is, or may be, recovered, 
you will carry me and my man to England, passage 
free.” 

He gave me all the assurances that the invention 
and faith of man could devise that he would comply 
with these most reasonable demands; and, besides, 
would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all 
occasions, as long as he lived. 

“ Well then," said I, “ here are three muskets for 
you, with powder and ball; tell me next what you 
think is proper to be done.” He showed all the testi- 
mony of his gratitude that he was able, but offered 
to be wholly guided by me. I told him I thought it 



NEW ARRIVALS 227 

was hard venturing anything; but the best method 
I could think of was to fire upon them at once as they 
lay; and if any was not killed at the first volley, and 
offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it 
wholly upon God’s providence to direct the shot. 

He said very modestly that he was loth to kill them, 
if he could help it ; but that those two were incorrigible 
villains, and had been the authors of all the mutiny 
in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone 
still ; for they would go on board and bring the whole 
ship’s company, and destroy us all. “ Well then,” 
says I, “ necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the 
only way to save our lives.” However, seeing him 
still cautious of shedding blood, I told him they should 
go themselves, and manage as they found convenient. 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of 
them awake, and soon after we saw two of them on 
their feet. I asked him if either of them were of the 
men who he had said were the heads of the mutiny. 
He said, “ No.” “ Well then,” said I, “ you may let 
them escape; and Providence seems to have wakened 
them on purpose to save themselves. Now,” says I, 
“ if the rest escape you, it is your fault.” 

Animated with this, he took the musket I had given 
him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two 
comrades with him, with each man a piece in his hand. 
The two men who were with him going first made some 
noise, at which one of the seamen who was awake 
turned about, and seeing them coming cried out to 
the rest; but it was too late then, for the moment 
he cried out they fired; I mean the two men, the 
captain wisely reserving his own piece. They had so 
well aimed their shot at the men they knew, that one 
of them was killed on the spot, and the other very 



228 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

much wounded; but not being dead, he started up 
upon his feet, and called eagerly for help to the other. 
But the captain stepping to him, told him ’twas too 
late to cry for help, he should call upon God to for- 
give his villainy; and with that word knocked him 
down with the stock of his musket, so that he never 
spoke more. There were three more in the company, 
and one of them was also slightly wounded. By this 
time I was come; and when they saw their danger, 
and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. 
The captain told them he would spare their lives if 
they would give any assurance of their abhorrence of 
the treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear 
to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and after- 
wards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from whence 
they came. They gave him all the protestations of 
their sincerity that could be desired, and he was 
willing to believe them, and spare their lives, which 
I was not against, only I obliged him to keep them 
bound hand and foot while they were upon the island. 

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the cap- 
tain^ mate to the boat, with orders to secure her, 
and bring away the oars and sail, which they did; 
and by-and-by three straggling men, that were (hap- 
pily for them) parted from the rest, came back upon 
hearing the guns fired, and seeing their captain, who 
before was their prisoner, now their conqueror, they 
submitted to be bound also, and so our victory was 
complete. 

It now remained that the captain and I should 
inquire into one another's circumstances. I began 
first, and told him my whole history, which he heard 
with an attention even to amazement; and particu- 
larly at the wonderful manner of my being furnished 



NEW ARRIVALS 


229 

with provisions and ammunition; and, indeed, as my 
story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him 
deeply. But when he reflected from thence upon 
himself, and how I seemed to have been preserved 
there on purpose to save his life, the tears ran down 
his face, and he could not speak a word more. 

After this communication was at an end, I carried 
him and his two men into my apartment, leading 
them in just where I came out, viz., at the top of the 
house, where I refreshed them with such provisions 
as I had, and showed them all the contrivances I had 
made during my long, long inhabiting that place. 

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly 
amazing; but above all, the captain admired my forti- 
fication, and how perfectly I had concealed my retreat 
with a grove of trees, which, having been now planted 
near twenty years, and the trees growing much faster 
than in England, was become a little wood, and so 
thick, that it was unpassable in any part, of it but at 
that one side where I had reserved m}' little winding 
passage into it. I told him this was my castle and my 
residence, but that I had a seat in the country, as 
most princes have, whither I could retreat upon occa- 
sion, and I would show him that too another time; 
but at present, our business was to consider how to 
recover the ship. He agreed with me as to that, but 
told me he was perfectly at a loss what measures to 
take, for that there were still six and twenty hands 
on board, who having entered into a cursed conspiracy, 
by which they had all forfeited their lives to the law, 
would be hardened in it now by desperation, and would 
carry it on, knowing that if they were reduced, they 
should be brought to the gallows as soon as they 
came to England, or to any of the English colonies; 



230 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

and that therefore there would be no attacking them 
with so small a number as we were. 

I mused for some time upon what he said, and found 
it was a very rational conclusion, and that therefore 
something was to be resolved on very speedily, as well 
to draw the men on board into some snare for their 
surprise, as to prevent their landing upon us, and 
destroying us. Upon this it presently occurred to me 
that in a little while the ship’s crew, wondering what 
was become of their comrades, and of the boat, would 
certainly come on shore in their other boat to see for 
them; and that then, perhaps, they might come 
armed, and be too strong for us. This he allowed was 
rational. 

Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to do 
was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so 
that they might not carry her off; and taking every- 
thing out of her, leave her so far useless as not to be 
fit to swim. Accordingly we went on board, took the 
arms which were left on board out of her, and what- 
ever else we found there, which was a bottle of brandy, 
and another of rum, a few biscuit-cakes, a horn of 
powder and a great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas 
— the sugar was five or six pounds; all which was 
very welcome to me, especially the brandy and sugar, 
of which I had had none left for many years. 

When we had carried all these things on shore (the 
oars, mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were carried 
away before, as above), we knocked a great hole in 
her bottom, that if they had come strong enough to 
master us, yet they could not carry off the boat. 

Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts that we 
could be able to recover the ship; but my view was, 
that if they went away without the boat, I did not 



THE MUTINEERS 231 

much question to make her fit again to carry us away 
to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our friends the 
Spaniards in my way; for I had them still in my 
thoughts. 


CHAPTER XIX 

THE MUTINEERS 

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had 
first, by main strength, heaved the boat up upon the 
beach so high that the tide would not fleet her off at 
high-water mark; and besides, had broke a hole in 
her bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were 
sat down musing what we should do, we heard the 
ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft with her 
ancient as a signal for the boat to come on board. 
But no boat stirred; and they fired several times, 
making other signals for the boat. 

At last, when all their signals and firings proved 
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw 
them, by the help of my glasses, hoist another boat 
out, and row towards the shore; and we found, as 
they approached, that there was no less than ten men 
in her, and that they had firearms with them. 

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, 
we had a full view of them as they came, and a plain 
sight of the men, even of their faces; because the 
tide having set them a little to the east of the other 
boat, they rowed up under shore, to come to the same 
place where the other had landed, and where the 
boat lay. 

By this means, I say, we had a full view of them, 
and the captain knew the persons and characters of 
all the men in the boat, of whom he said that there 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


232 

were three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, 
were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being over- 
powered and frighted; but that as for the boatswain, 
who, it seems, was the chief officer among them, and 
all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of the 
ship’s crew, and were no doubt made desperate in their 
new enterprise ; and terribly apprehensive he was that 
they would be too powerful for us. 

I smiled at him, and told him that men in our 
circumstances were past the operation of fear; that 
seeing almost every condition that could be was better 
than that which we were supposed to be in, we ought 
to expect that the consequence, whether death or life, 
would be sure to be a deliverance. I asked him what 
he thought of the circumstances of my life, and 
whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for? ” 
“ And where, sir,” said I, “ is your belief of my being 
preserved here on purpose to save your life, which 
elevated you a little while ago? For my part/’ said 
I, " there seems to be but one thing amiss in all the 
prospect of it.” " What’s that? ” says he. " Why,” 
says I, “ ’tis that, as you say, there are three or four 
honest fellows among them, which should be spared; 
had they been all of the wicked part of the crew I 
should have thought God’s providence had singled 
them out to deliver them into your hands ; for depend 
upon it, every man of them that comes ashore are our 
own, and shall die or live as they behave to us.” 

As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful 
countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him; so 
we set vigorously to our business. We had, upon the 
first appearance of the boat’s coming from the ship, 
considered of separating our prisoners, and had, indeed, 
secured them effectually. 



THE MUTINEERS 233 

Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured 
than ordinary, I sent with Friday and one of the three 
delivered men to my cave, where they were remote 
enough, and out of danger of being heard or discovered, 
or of finding their way out of the woods if they could 
have delivered themselves. Here they left them bound, 
but gave them provisions, and promised them, if they 
continued there quietly, to give them their liberty in 
a day or two ; but that if they attempted their escape, 
they should be put to death without mercy. They 
promised faithfully to bear their confinement with 
patience, and were very thankful that they had such 
good usage as to have provisions and a light left 
them ; for Friday gave them candles (such as we made 
ourselves) for their comfort; and they did not know 
but that he stood sentinel over them at the entrance. 

The other prisoners had better usage. Two of them 
were kept pinioned, indeed, because the captain was 
not free to trust them ; but the other two were taken 
into my service, upon their captain's recommendation, 
and upon their solemnly engaging to live and die with 
us; so with them and the three honest men we were 
seven men well armed; and I made no doubt we 
should be able to deal well enough with the ten that 
were a-coming, considering that the captain had said 
there were three or four honest men among them also. 

As soon as they got to the place where their other 
boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and came 
all on shore, hauling the £oat up after them, which 
I was glad to see ; for I wa$ afraid they would rather 
have left the boat at an anchor some distance from 
the shore, with some hands in her to guard her, and 
so we should not be able to seize the boat. 

Being on shore, the first thing they did they ran 

*H 



234 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

all to their other boat; and it was easy to see that 
they were under a great surprise to find her stripped, 
as above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in 
her bottom. 

After they had mused a while upon this, they set 
up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their 
might, to try if they could make their companions 
hear; but all was to no purpose. Then they came 
all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small arms, 
which, indeed, we heard, and the echoes made the 
woods ring. But it was all one ; those in the* cave we 
were sure could not hear, and those in our keeping, 
though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no 
answer to them. 

They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that, 
as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on 
board again, to their ship, and let them know there 
that the men were all murdered, and the longboat 
staved. Accordingly, they immediately launched their 
boat again, and gat all of them on board. 

The captain was terribly amazed, and even con- 
founded at this, believing they would go on board the 
ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades for lost, 
and so he should still lose the ship, which he was in 
hopes we should have recovered; but he was quickly 
as much frightened the other way. 

They had not been long put off with the boat but 
we perceived them all coming on shore again; but 
with this new measure in their conduct, which it seems 
they consulted together upon, viz., to leave three men 
in the boat, and. the rest to go on shore, and go up 
into the country to look for their fellows. 

This was a great disappointment to us, for now we 
were at a loss what to do; for our seizing those seven 



THE MUTINEERS 235 

men on shore would be no advantage if we let the boat 
escape, because they would then row away to the ship, 
and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and 
set sail, and so our recovering the ship would be lost. 
However, we had no remedy but to wait and see what 
the issue of things might present. The seven men 
came on shore, and the three who remained in the 
boat put her off to a good distance from the shore, 
and came to an anchor to wait for them; so that it 
was impossible for us to come at them in the boat. 

Those that came on shore kept close together, 
marching towards the top of the little hill under which 
my habitation lay; and we could see them plainly, 
though they could not perceive us. We could have 
been very glad they would have come nearer to us, 
so that we might have fired at them, or that they 
would have gone farther off, that we might have come 
abroad. 

But when they were come to the brow of the hill, 
where they could see a great way into the valleys and 
woods which lay towards the north-east part, and 
where the island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed 
till they were weary; and not caring, it seems, to 
venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, 
they sat down together under a tree, to consider of it. 
Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep there, as 
the other party of them had done, they had done the 
job for us; but they were too full of apprehensions of 
danger to venture to go to sleep, though they could not 
tell what the danger was they had to fear neither. 

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon 
this consultation of theirs, viz., that perhaps they would 
all fire a volley again, to endeavour to make their 
fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon them. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


236 

just at the juncture when their pieces were all dis- 
charged, and they would certainly yield, and we should 
have them without bloodshed. I liked the proposal, 
provided it was done while we were near enough 
to come up to them before they could load their pieces 
again. 

But this event did not happen, and we lay still a 
long time, very irresolute what course to take. At 
length I told them there would be nothing to be done, 
in my opinion, till night; and then, if they did not 
return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get 
between them and the shore and so might use some 
stratagem with them in the boat to get them on shore. 

We waited a great while, though very impatient 
for their removing; and were very uneasy when, after 
long consultations, we saw them start all up, and 
march down towards the sea. It seems they had such 
dreadful apprehensions upon them of the danger of 
the place, that they had resolved to go on board the 
ship again, give their companions over for lost, and 
so go on with their intended voyage with the ship. 

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, 
I imagined it to be, as it really was, that they had 
given over their search, and were for going back again ; 
and the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, 
was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it; but I 
presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back 
again, and which answered my end to a tittle. 

I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over 
the little creek westward, towards the place where 
the savages came on shore when Friday was rescued, 
and as soon as they came to a little rising ground, at 
about half a mile distance, I bade them halloo as loud 
as they could, and wait till they found the seamen 



THE MUTINEERS 237 

heard them; that as soon as ever they heard the 
seamen answer them, they should return it again; 
and then keeping out of sight, take a round, always 
answering when the other hallooed, to draw them as 
far into the island, and among the woods, as possible, 
and then wheel about again to me by such ways as I 
directed them. 

They were just going into the boat when Friday 
and the mate hallooed ; and they presently heard them, 
and answering, ran along the shore westward, towards 
the voice they heard, when they were presently stopped 
by the creek, where the water being up, they could not 
get over, and called for the boat to come up and set 
them over, as, indeed, I expected. 

When they had set themselves over, I observed that 
the boat being gone up a good way into the creek, 
and, as it were, in a harbour within the land, they took 
one of the three men out of her to go along with them, 
and left only two in the boat, having fastened her to 
the stump of a little tree on the shore. 

That was what I wished for; and immediately 
leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their business, 
I took the rest with me, and crossing the creek out of 
their sight, we surprised the two men before they were 
aware ; one of them lying on shore, and the other being 
in the boat. The fellow on shore was between sleeping 
and waking, and going to start up. The captain, who 
was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked him 
down, and then called out to him in the boat to yield, 
or he was a dead man. 

There needed very few arguments to persuade a 
single man to yield when he saw five men upon him, 
and his comrade knocked down; besides, this was, 
it seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in 



238 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore was 
easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to 
join very sincerely with us. 

In the meantime, Friday and the captain's mate so 
well managed their business with the rest, that they 
drew them, by hallooing and answering, from one hill 
to another, and from one wood to another, till they 
not only heartily tired them, but left them where they 
were very sure they could not reach back to the boat 
before it was dark; and, indeed, they were heartily 
tired themselves also by the time they came back to us. 

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them 
in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure 
work with them. 

It was several hours after Friday came back to me 
before they came back to their boat ; and we could hear 
the foremost of them, long before they came quite up, 
calling to those behind to come along, and could also 
hear them answer and complain how lame and tired 
they were, and not able to come any faster; which was 
very welcome news to us. 

At length they came up to the boat; but 'tis im- 
possible to express their confusion when they found 
the boat fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, 
and their two men gone. We could hear them calling 
to one another in a most lamentable manner, telling 
on& another they were gotten into an enchanted island ; 
that either there were inhabitants in it, and they 
should all be murdered, or else there were devils and 
spirits in it, and they should all be carried away and 
devoured. 

They hallooed again, and called their two comrades 
by’ their names a great many times; but no answer. 
After some time we could see them, by the little light 



THE MUTINEERS 239 

there was, run about, wringing their hands like men 
in despair, and that sometimes they would go and sit 
down in the boat to rest themselves, then come ashore 
again, and walk about again, and so the same thing 
over again. 

My men would fain have me give them leave to 
fall upon them at once in the dark ; but I was willing 
to take them at some advantage, so to spare them, and 
kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was 
unwilling to hazard the killing any of our own men, 
knowing the others were very well armed. I resolved 
to wait, to see if they did not separate ; and, therefore, 
to make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade nearer, 
and ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon 
their hands and feet, as close to the ground as they could, 
that they might not be discovered, and get as near 
them as they could possibly, before they offered to fire. 

They had not been long in that posture but that 
the boatswain, who was the principal ringleader of the 
mutiny, and had now shown himself the most dejected 
and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards 
them, with two more of their crew. The captain was 
so eager, as having this principal rogue so much in his 
power, that he could hardly have patience to let him 
come so near as to be sure of him, for they only heard 
his tongue before; but when they came nearer, the 
captain and Friday, starting up on their feet, let fly 
at them. 

The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the next 
man was shot into the body, and fell just by him, 
though he did not die till an hour or two after ; and 
the third ran for it. 

At the noise of the fire I immediately advanced with 
my whole army, which was now eight men, viz., myself. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


240 

generalissimo; Friday, my lieutenant-general; the 
captain and his two men, and the three prisoners of 
war, whom we had trusted with arms. 

We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that 
they could not see our number; and I made the man 
we had left in the boat, who was now one of us, call 
to them by name, to try if I could bring them to a 
parley, and so might perhaps reduce them to terms, 
which fell out just as we desired; for indeed it was 
easy to think, as their condition then was, they would 
be very willing to capitulate. So he calls out as loud 
as he could to one of them, “Tom Smith! Tom 
Smith! " Tom Smith answered immediately, 4 4 Who's 
that? Robinson? " For it seems he knew his voice. 
The other answered, 44 Ay, ay; for God's sake, Tom 
Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or you are all 
dead men this moment." 

44 Who must we yield to? Where are they? " says 
Smith again. 44 Here they are," says he; 44 here's our 
captain, and fifty men with him, have been hunting 
you this two hours; the boatswain is killed. Will Frye 
is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if you do not 
yield, you are all lost." 

44 Will they give us quarter then," says Tom Smith, 
44 and we will yield ? " 44 I'll go and ask, if you promise 
to yield," says Robinson. So he asked the captain, 
and the captain himself then calls out, 44 You, Smith, 
you know my voice, if you lay down your arms immedi- 
ately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all but 
Will Atkins." 

Upon this Will Atkins cried out, 44 For God's sake, 
captain, give me quarter; what have I done? They 
have been all as bad as I ”; which by the way, was 
not true neither; for, it seems, this Will Atkins was 



THE MUTINEERS 241 

the first man that laid hold of the captain when they 
first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying his 
hands, and giving him injurious language. However, 
the captain told him he must lay down his arms at 
discretion, and trust to the governor's mercy; by 
which he meant me, for they all called me governor. 

In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged 
their lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed 
with them and two more, who bound them all; and 
then my great army of fifty men, which, particularly 
with those three, were all but eight, came up and seized 
upon them all, and upon their boat ; only that I kept 
myself and one more out of sight for reasons of state. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of 
seizing the ship; and as for the captain, now he had 
leisure to parley with them, he expostulated with them 
upon the villainy of their practices with him, and at 
length upon the farther wickedness of their design, 
and how certainly it must bring them to misery and 
distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows. 

They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard 
for their lives. As for that, he told them they were 
none of his prisoners, but the commander of the island; 
that they thought they had set him on shore in a barren 
uninhabited island ; but it had pleased God so to direct 
them that the island was inhabited, and that the 
governor was an Englishman; that he might hang 
them all there, if he pleased; but as he had given them 
all quarter, he supposed he would send them to Eng- 
land to be dealt with there as justice required, except 
Atkins, whom he was commanded by the governor to 
advise to prepare for death, for that he would be 
hanged in the morning. 

Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


242 

its desired effect. Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg 
the captain to intercede with the governor for his life; 
and all the rest begged of him, for God's sake, that 
they might not be sent to England. 

It now occurred to me that the time of our deliver- 
ance was come, and that it would be a most easy thing 
to bring these fellows in to be hearty in getting pos 
session of the ship ; so I retired in the dark from them, 
that they might not see what kind of a governor they 
had, and called the captain to me. When I called, as 
at a good distance, one of the men was ordered to 
speak, again, and say to the captain, “ Captain, the 
commander calls for you." And presently the captain 
replied, “ Tell his excellency I am just a-coming.” 
This more perfectly amused them, and they all believed 
that the commander was just by with his fifty men. 

Upon the captain’s coming to me, I told him my 
project for seizing the ship, which he liked of wonder- 
fully well, and resolved to put it in execution the next 
morning. But in order to execute it with more art, 
and secure of success, I told him we must divide the 
prisoners, and that he should go and take Atkins and 
two more of the worst of them, and send them pinioned 
to the cave where the others lay. This was committed 
to Friday and the two men who came on shore with 
the captain. 

They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison. 
And it was, indeed, a dismal place, especially to men 
in their condition. The others I ordered to my bower, 
as I called it, of which I have given a full description; 
and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place 
was secure enough, considering they were upon their 
behaviour. 

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was 



THE MUTINEERS 243 

to enter into a parley with them; in a word, to try 
them, and tell me whether he thought they might be 
trusted or no to go on board and surprise the ship. 
He talked to them of the injury done him, of the 
condition they were brought to ; and that though the 
governor had given them quarter for their lives as to 
the present action, yet that if they were sent to 
England they would all be hanged in chains, to be 
sure; but that if they would join in so just an attempt 
as to recover the ship, he would have the governor's 
engagement for their pardon. 

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal 
would be accepted by men in their condition. They 
fell down on their knees to the captain, and promised, 
with the deepest imprecations, that they would be 
'faithful to him to the last drop, and that they should 
owe their lives to him, and would go with him all 
over the world; that they would own him for a father 
to them as long as they lived. 

“ Well," says the captain, “ I must go and tell the 
governor what you say, and see what I can do to bring 
him to consent to it.” So he brought me an account 
of the temper he found them in, and that he verily 
believed they would be faithful. 

However, that we might be very secure, I told him 
he should be back again and choose out five of them, 
and tell them they might see that he did not want 
men, that he would take out those five to be his assist- 
ants, and that the governor would keep the other two 
and the three that were sent prisoners to the castle, 
my cave, as hostages for the fidelity of those five; and 
that if they proved unfaithful in the execution, the 
five hostages should be hanged in chains alive upon 
the shore. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


244 

This looked severe, and convinced them that the 
governor was in earnest. However, they had no way 
left them but to accept it ; and it was now the business 
of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to persuade 
the other five to do their duty. 

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedi- 
tion. r. The captain, his mate, and passenger. 2. Then 
the two prisoners of the first gang, to whom, having 
their characters from the captain, I had given their 
liberty, and trusted them with arms. 3. The other 
two whom I had kept till now in my bower, pinioned, 
but upon the captain’s motion had now released. 
4. These five released at last ; so that they were twelve all, 
besides five we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages. 

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture 
with these hands on board the ship; for as for m 4 
and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper 
for us to stir, having seven men left behind, and it 
was employment enough for us to keep them asunder 
and supply them with victuals. As to the five in the 
cave, I resolved to keep them fast; but Friday went 
in twice a day to them, to supply them with neces- 
saries; and I made the other two carry provisions to 
a certain distance, where Friday was to take it. 

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was 
with the captain, who told them I was the person the 
governor had ordered to look after them, and that it 
was the governor’s pleasure they should not stir any- 
where but by my direction; that if they did, they 
should be fetched into the castle, and be laid in -irons ; 
so that as we never suffered them to see me as governor, 
so I now appeared as another person, and spoke of 
the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, 
upon all occasions. 



THE MUTINEERS 245 

The captain now had no difficulty before him but to 
furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and 
man them. He made his passenger captain of one, 
with four other men ; and himself, and his mate, and 
five more went in the other ; and they contrived their 
business very well, for they came up to the ship about 
midnight. As soon as they came within call of the ship, 
he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they 
brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a. 
long time before they had found them, and the like, 
holding them in a chat till they came to the ship’s 
side; when the captain and the mate entering first, 
with their arms, immediately knocked down the second 
mate and carpenter with the butt-end of their muskets, 
being very faithfully seconded by their men. They 
secured all the rest that were upon the main and 
quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches to 
keep them down who were below; when the other 
boat and their men entering at the fore-chains, secured 
the fore-castle of the ship, and the scuttle which went 
down into the cook-room, making three men they 
found there prisoners. 

When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the 
captain ordered the mate, with three men, to break 
into the round-house, where the new rebel captain lay, 
and having taken the alarm was gotten up, and with 
two men and a boy had gotten firearms in their hands; 
and when the mate with a crow split open the door, 
the new captain and his men fired boldly among them, 
and wounded the mate with a musket-ball, which 
broke his arm, and wounded two more of the men, 
but killed nobody. 

The mate calling for help, rushed however into the 
round-house wounded as he was, and with his pistol 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


246 

shot the new captain through the head, the bullet 
entering at his mouth and came out again behind one 
of his ears, so that he never spoke a word ; upon which 
the rest yielded, and the ship was taken effectually, 
without any more lives lost. 

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain 
ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the signal 
agreed upon with me to give me notice of his success, 
which you may be sure I was very glad to hear, having 
sat watching upon the shore for it till near two of the 
clock in the morning. 

Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me 
down; and it having been a day of great fatigue to 
me, I slept very sound, till I was something surprised 
with the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, 
I heard a man call me by the name of “ Governor/' 
“ Governor,” and presently I knew the captain's voice; 
when climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, 
and pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms. 
“ My dear friend and deliverer,” says he, " there's 
your ship, for she is all yours, and so are we, and all 
that belong to her.” I cast my eyes to the ship, and 
there she rode within little more than half a mile of 
the shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon 
as they were masters of her, and the weather being 
fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the 
mouth of the little creek, and the tide being up, the 
captain had brought the pinnace in near the place 
where I at first landed my rafts, and so landed just 
at my door. 

I was at first ready to sink down with the surprise; 
for I saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly put into my 
hands, all things easy, and a large ship just ready to 
carry me away whither I pleased to go. At first, for 



THE END OF THE STORY 247 

some time, I was not able to answer him one word; 
but as he had taken me in his arms, I held fast by 
him, or I should have fallen to the ground. 

He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulls a 
bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of 
cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me. 
After I had drank it, I sat down upon the ground; 
and though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good 
while before I could speak a word to him. 

All this while the poor man was in as great an 
ecstasy as I, only not under any surprise, as I was; 
and he said a thousand kind tender things to me, to 
compose me and bring me to myself. But such was the 
flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits 
into confusion. At last it broke out into tears, and in 
a little while after I recovered my speech. 

Then I took my turn, and embraced him as my 
deliverer, and we rejoiced together. I told him I 
looked upon him as a man sent from heaven to deliver 
me, and that the whole transaction seemed to be a 
chain of wonders; that such things as these were the 
testimonies we had of a secret hand of Providence 
governing the world, and evidence that the eyes of 
an infinite Power could search into the remotest comer 
of the world, and send help to the miserable whenever 
He pleased.

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


CHAPTER XX 

THE END OF THE STORY 

I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to 
heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless Him, 
who had not only in a miraculous manner provided 
for one in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate 
condition, but from whom every deliverance must 
always be acknowledged to proceed ? 

When we had talked a while, the captain told me 
he had brought some little refreshment, such as the 
ship afforded, and such as the wretches that had been 
so long his masters had not plundered him of. Upon 
this he called aloud to the boat, and bid his men bring 
the things ashore that were for the governor; and, 
indeed, it was a present as if I had been one, not that 
was to be carried away along with them, but as if 
I had been to dwell upon the island still, and they 
were to go without me. 

First, he had brought me a case of bottles full of 
excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira 
wine (the bottles held two quarts apiece), two pounds 
of excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the 
ship's beef, and. six pieces of pork, with a bag of peas, 
and about a hundredweight of biscuit. 

He brought me also a box of sugar, a box of flour, 
a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, 
and abundance of other things; but besides these, 
and what was a thousand times more useful to me, he 
brought me six clean new shirts, six very good neck- 
cloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, 
and one pair of stockings, and a very good suit of 



THE END OF THE STORY 


249 

clothes of his own, which had been worn but very 
little; in a word, he clothed me from head to foot. 

It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any 
one may imagine, to one in my circumstances; but 
never was anything in the world of that kind so un- 
pleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to me to 
wear such clothes at their first putting on. 

After these ceremonies passed, and after all his good 
things were brought into my little apartment, we 
began to consult what was to be done with the 
prisoners we had; for it was worth considering whether 
we might venture to take them away with us or no, 
especially two of them, whom we knew to be incor- 
rigible and refractory to the last degree; and the 
captain said he knew they were such rogues, that 
there was no obliging them ; and if he did carry them 
away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be de- 
livered ovei; to justice at the first English colony he 
could come at ; and I found that the captain himself 
was very anxious about it. 

Upon this I told him that, if he desired it, I durst 
undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make 
it their own request that he should leave them upon 
the island. “ I should be very glad of that,” says the 
captain, “ with all my heart.” 

“ Well,” says I, “ I will send for them up, and talk 
with them for you.” So I caused Friday and the two 
hostages, for they were now discharged, their comrades 
having performed their promise; I say, I caused them 
to go to the cave and bring up the five men, pinioned 
as they were, to the bower, and keep them there till 
I came. 

After some time I came thither, dressed in my new 
habit; and now I was called governor again. Being 



250 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

all met, and the captain with me, I caused the men 
to be brought before me, and I told them I had had 
a full account of their villainous behaviour to the 
captain, and how they had run away with the ship, 
and were preparing to commit farther robberies, but 
that Providence had ensnared them in their own ways, 
and that they were fallen into the pit which they had 
digged for others. 

I let them know that by my direction the ship had 
been seized, that she lay now in the road, and they 
might see, by and by, that their new captain had 
received the reward of his villainy, for that they might 
see him hanging at the yard-arm; that as to them, 
I wanted to know what they had to say why I should 
not execute them as pirates, taken in the fact, as by my 
commission they could not doubt I had authority to do. 

One of them answered in the name of the rest that 
they had nothing to say but this, that when they were 
taken the captain promised them their lives, and they 
humbly implored my mercy. But I told them I knew 
not what mercy to show them; for as for myself, I 
had resolved to quit the island with ail my men, and 
had taken passage with the captain to go for England. 
And as for the captain, he could not carry them to 
England other than as prisoners in irons, to be tried 
for mutiny, and running away with the ship; the 
consequence of which, they must needs know, would 
be the gallows; so that I could not tell which was 
best for them, unless they had a mind to take their 
fate in the island. If they desired that, I did not care, 
as I had liberty to leave it. I had some inclination to 
give them their lives, if they thought they could shift 
on shore. 

They seemed very thankful for it, said they would 



THE END OF THE STORY 251 

much rather venture to stay there than to be carried 
to England to be hanged ; so I left it on that issue. 

However, the captain seemed to make some diffi- 
culty of it, as if he durst not leave them there. Upon 
this I seemed a little angry with the captain, and told 
him that they were my prisoners, not his; and that 
seeing I had offered them so much favour, I would 
be as good as my word; and that if he did not think 
fit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty, as I 
found them ; and if he did not like it, he might take 
them again if he could catch them. 

Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I 
accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire 
into the woods to the place whence they came, and 
I would leave them some firearms, some ammunition, 
and some directions how they should live very well, 
if they thought fit. 

Upon this I prepared to go on board the ship, but 
told the captain that I would stay that night to prepare 
my things, and desired him to go on board in the 
meantime, and keep all right in the ship, and send the 
boat on shore the next day for me; ordering him, in 
the meantime, to cause the new captain, who was 
killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men 
might see him. 

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up 
to me to my apartment, and entered seriously into 
discourse with them of their circumstances. I told 
them I thought they had made a right choice; that 
if the captain carried them away, they would certainly 
be hanged. I showed them the new captain hanging 
at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had 
nothing less to expect. 

When they all declared their willingness to stay, I 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


252 

then told them I would let them into the story of my 
living there, and put them into the way of v making it 
easy to them. Accordingly I gave them the whole 
history of the place, and of my coming to it, showing 
them my fortifications, the way I made my bread, 
planted my com, cured my grapes; and in a word, 
all that was necessary to make them easy. I told them 
the story also of the sixteen Spaniards that were to be 
expected, for whom I left a letter, and made them 
promise to treat them in common with themselves. 

I left them my firearms, viz., five muskets, three 
fowling-pieces, and three swords. I had above a barrel 
and half of powder left; for after the first year or 
two I used but little, and wasted none. I gave them 
a description of the way I managed the goats, and 
directions to milk and fatten them, and to make both 
butter and cheese. 

In a word, I gave them every part of my own story, 
and I told them I would prevail with the captain to 
leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and 
some garden seeds, which I told them I would have 
been very glad of. Also I gave them the bag of peas 
which the captain had brought me to eat, and bade 
them be sure to sow and increase them. 

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and 
went on board the ship. We prepared immediately 
to sail, but did not weigh that night. The next morn- 
ing early two of the five men came swimming to the 
ship’s side, and making a most lamentable complaint of 
the other three, begged to be taken into the ship for 
God’s sake, for they should be murdered, and begged 
the captain to take them on board, though he hanged 
them immediately. 

Upon this the captain pretended to have no power 



THE END OF THE STORY 253 

without me; but after some difficulty, and after their 
solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on 
board, and were some time after soundly whipped and 
pickled, after which they proved very honest and quiet 
fellows. 

Some time after this the boat was ordered on shore, 
the tide being up, with the things promised to the men, 
to which the captain, at my intercession, caused their 
chests and clothes to be added, which they took, and 
were very thankful for. I also encouraged them by 
telling them that if it lay in my way to send any vessel 
to take them in, I would not forget them. 

When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, 
for relics, the great goatskin cap I had made, my 
umbrella, and my parrot ; also I forgot not to take the 
money I formerly mentioned, which had lain by me 
so long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished, 
and could hardly pass for silver till it had been a little 
rubbed and handled ; as also the money I found in the 
wreck of the Spanish ship. 

And thus I left the island, the 19th of December as 
I found by the ship’s account, in the year 1686, after 
I had been upon it eight and twenty years, two months, 
and nineteen days, being delivered from this second 
captivity the same day of the month that I first made 
my escape in the barco-longo , from the Moors of Sallee. 

In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in 
England, the nth of June, in the year 1687, having 
been thirty and five years absent. 

When I came to England, I was as perfect a stranger 
to all the world as if I had never been known there. 
My benefactor and faithful steward, whom I had left 
in trust with my money, was alive, but had had great 
misfortunes in the world, was become a widow the 



254 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

second time, and very low in the world. I made her 
easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would 
give her no trouble; but on the contrary, in gratitude 
to her former care and faithfulness to me, I relieved 
her as my little stock would afford; winch, at that 
time, would indeed allow me to do but little for her; 
but I assured her I would never forget her former 
kindness to me, nor did I forget her when I had 
sufficient to help her, as shall be observed in its place. 

I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my 
father was dead, and my mother and all the family 
extinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of 
the children of one of my brothers; and as I had been 
long ago given over for dead, there had been no pro- 
vision made for me ; so that, in a word, I found nothing 
to relieve or assist me; and that little money I had 
would not do much for me as to settling in the world. 

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I 
did not expect; and this was, that the master of the 
ship whom I had so happily delivered, and by the 
same means saved the ship and cargo, having given a 
very handsome account to the owners of the manner 
how I had saved the lives of the men, and the ship, 
they invited me to meet them, and some other mer- 
chants concerned, and all together made me a very 
handsome compliment upon the subject, and a present 
of almost two hundred pounds sterling. 

But after making several reflections upon the cir- 
cumstances of my life, and how little way this would 
go towards settling me in the world, I resolved to go 
to Lisbon, and see if I might not come by some informa- 
tion of the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and 
of what was become of my partner, who I had reason 
to suppose had some years now given me over for dead. 



COMMENTARY AND QUESTIONS 





Daniel Defoe, born in or about 1660, was the son of 
James Foe, a butcher; and his grandfather was a 
yeoman. This is important, for it means that Defoe, 
in spite of a good education in many languages, including 
his own, naturally spoke and wrote plain, strong, middle- 
class English without polish or any sort of pomposity 
or erudition. He was a middle-class, common-sense 
Englishman, though a genius of course; and he had a 
Shakespearean capacity for putting himself into other 
people's shoes, so to speak; and if he too often wrote of 
rogues, thieves, and pirates, that was probably in order 
to sell his books, and one cannot blame him. After all, 
we see the same thing in our own day in the vogue of 
crook stories and detective yams. Defoe even wrote a 
History of the Devil. 

The power of his writing lies in its truth — the piling 
up of innumerable apparently trivial details till the 
reader’s mind says: “He must have seen it, or he never 
could have put it all down! ” Thus, when he describes 
the Plague of London one can hardly believe that he is 
not recounting what he actually remembers — but in 
point of fact he was a very small child when it happened. 

And in his immortal work, Robinson Crusoe , he simply 
is the lonely sailor. The book is the best example of 
the " adventure as told by oneself” which came before 
the true novel; and Defoe is the literary father of 
Richardson and Fielding; while in his “ Scandal Club” 
he really hit upon the idea of the Toilers and Spectators 
which soon followed.

*57 



258 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

He made a great deal of money by his writings, and 
built himself “ a very handsome house ” in London. He 
was "a middle-sized spare man of a brown complexion, 
and dark brown hair, but wearing a wig ; a hooked nose, 
a sharp chin, grey eyes, and a large mole near his mouth. 
Such was the description published when the author 
was "wanted” to stand in the pillory — which he did 
three times for his political writings. For he wrote 
about everything. Before he began his novels he had 
written more than two hundred treatises,- pamphlets, 
and booklets on all sorts of subjects, all with a knowledge 
of other people’s business such as no one else has ever 
approached — not even Shakespeare. 

He had a very wonderful way, too, of making difficult 
and complicated subjects quite understandable — just as 
certain great English scientists have at the present day. 
That was partly because he was extremely clear-headed 
himself — so clear-headed that in some respects he was 
centuries ahead of his time. But it was due quite as 
much to the fact that he was used to expressing himself 
in ordinary straightforward English without any frills 
or flourishes. He thought clearly, and as he thought, 
he wrote. The grand scholars affected to despise him; 
but the great English public is wiser than the scholars, 
and Robinson Crusoe remains, and is likely to remain, 
one of the best-loved and most widely read books in 
the language. And that brings us to another point. 

The book as we have it here stops short a little before 
the end of the First Part. There is still that bit at the 
end, and the whole of Part II to come; but while every 
educated person in the country has read Part I as it is 
here, not one person in twenty thousand has eveT read 
the rest. Now how is that? Well, the reason is not 
very far to seek. In the first part Robinson Crusoe is 



COMMENTARY AND QUESTIONS 259 

a unique and lonely figure, “ monarch of all he surveys,** 
centre of one of the most romantic and convincing stories 
in the world. Up to the time of his return to England, 
as recounted at the end of this volume, he keeps this 
glamour, as a lone, romantic, and most memorable 
man. But after that, and all through Part II, he is 
just a man of the world, one among many. He drops on 
to a lower plane altogether; and, in spite of his adven- 
tures, we lose interest in him and his doings. And so 
quite rightly, unless we are great readers, we make the 
break where the editor of this volume has made it, and 
leave Robinson Crusoe in his grandeur. 

One is loath to leave Man Friday, however. In 
Part II he is shot with arrows and killed by his own 
people while addressing them from the deck of the ship. 
But there is one jolly and typical scene before that 
which it would be a pity to miss ; and so I add it here: 

Man Friday and the Bear 

“My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when 
we came up to him he was helping him off from his 
horse; for the man was both hurt and frighted, and 
indeed the last more than the first ; when, on the sudden, 
we spied the bear come out of the wood, and a vast 
monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw. 
We were all a little surprised when we saw him; but 
when Friday saw him, it was easy to see joy and courage 
in the fellow’s countenance. * 01 0 ! 0 ! * says Friday, 
three times pointing to him. *0 master! you give me 
te leave; me shakee te hand with him; me make you 
good laugh.*’ 

“I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased. 4 You 
fool you,* says I, 'he will eat you up/ ‘Eatee me upl 



260 ROBINSON CRUSOE 

eatee me up!' says Friday, twice over again; 'me eatee 
him up; me make you good laugh; you all stay here, me 
show you good laugh.' So down he sits, and gets his 
boots off in a moment, and put on a pair of pumps, as 
we call the flat shoes they wear, and which he had in 
his pocket, gives my other servant his horse, and with 
his gun away he flew, swift like the wind. 

"The bear was walking softly on, and offered to 
meddle with nobody till Friday, coming pretty near, 
calls to him, as if the bear could understand him, 
'Hark ye, hark ye,' says Friday, 'me speakee wit you.' 
We followed at a distance; for now being come down on 
the Gascoign side of the mountains, we were entered a 
vast great forest, where the country was plain and 
pretty open, though many trees in it scattered here 
and there. 

"Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, 
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great stone 
and throws at him, and hit him just on the head, but 
did him no more harm than if he had thrown it against 
a wall. But it answered Friday’s end, for the rogue was 
so void of fear, that he did it purely to make the bear 
follow him, and show us some laugh, as he called it. 

"As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, he 
turns about, and comes after him, taking devilish long 
strides, and shuffling along at a strange rate, so as would 
have put a horse to a middling gallop. Away runs 
Friday, and takes his course as if he run towards us for 
help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear, 
and deliver my man ; though I was angry at him heartily 
for bringing the bear back upon us, when he was going 
about his own business another way; and especially I 
was angry, that he had turned the bear upon us, and 
then run away; and I called out, 'You dog/ said I, 'is 



COMMENTARY AND QUESTIONS 261 

this your making us laugh ? Come away, and take your 
horse, that we may shoot the creature/ He hears me, 
and cries out, ‘No shoot, no shoot; stand still, you get 
much laugh/ And as the nimble creature run two feet 
for the beast's one, he turned on a sudden, on one side 
of us, and seeing a great oak tree fit for his purpose, he 
beckoned to us to follow ; and doubling his pace, he gets 
nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the ground, 
at about five or six yards from the bottom of the tree. 

“The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at 
a distance. The first thing he did, he stopped at the 
gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles into 
the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrously 
heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of 
my man, and could not for my life see anything to 
laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we all 
rode nearer to him. 

“When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out 
to the small end of a large limb of the tree, and the bear 
got about half way to him. As soon as the bear got 
out to that part where the limb of the tree was weaker, 
‘Ha! ' says he to us, ‘now you see me teachee the bear 
dance/ So he falls a-jumping and shaking the bough, 
at which the bear began to totter, but stood still, and 
began to look behind him, to see how he should get 
back. Then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. But 
Friday had not done with him by a great deal. When he 
sees him stand still, he calls out to him again, as if he 
had supposed the bear could speak English, ‘What, you 
no come farther? pray you come farther'; so he left 
jumping and shaking the tree; and the bear, just as if 
he had understood what he said, did come a little 
farther; then he fell a-jumping again, and the bear 
stopped again. 



262 


ROBINSON CRUSOE 


“We thought now was a good time to knock him on 
the head, and I called to Friday to stand still, and we 
would shoot the bear; but he cried out earnestly, ‘0 
pray! O pray! no shoot, me shoot by and then'; he 
would have said by and by. However, to shorten the 
story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so 
ticklish, that we had laughing enough indeed, but still 
could not imagine what the fellow would do: for first 
we thought he depended upon shaking the bear off; 
and we found the bear was too cunning for that too; for 
he would not go out far enough to be thrown down, but 
clings fast with his great broad claws and feet, so that 
we could not imagine what would be the end of it, and 
where the jest would be at last. 

“But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for seeing 
the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would not 
be persuaded to come any farther, ‘Well, well,' says 
Friday, ‘you no come farther, me go, me go; you no 
come to me, me go come to you * ; and upon this he goes 
out to the smallest end of the bough, where it would 
bend with his weight, and gently lets himself down by 
it, sliding down the bough till he came near enough to 
jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, 
takes it up, and stands still. 

“ ' Well/ said I to him, ‘ Friday, what will you do now ? 
Why don't you shoot him?’ ‘No shoot,' says Friday, 
‘no yet; me shoot now, me no kill; me stay, give you 
one more laugh/ And, indeed, so he did, as you will 
see presently; for when the bear sees his enemy gone, 
he comes back from the bough where he stood, but did 
it mighty leisurely, looking behind him every step, and 
coming backward till he got into the body of the tree; 
then with the same hinder end foremost he comes down 
the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one 



COMMENTARY AND QUESTIONS 263 

foot at a time, very leisurely. At this juncture, and 
just before he could set his hind feet upon the ground, 
Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle of 
his piece into his ear, and shot him dead as a stone. 

“Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not 
laugh ; and when he saw we were pleased by our looks, 
he falls a-laughing himself very loud. 1 So we kill bear 
in my country,' says Friday. ‘ So you kill them? ’ says 
I; ‘why, you have no guns/ ‘No/ says he, ‘no gun, 
but shoot great much long arrow/" 


THE ORIGINAL ROBINSON CRUSOE 

The charm of Robinson Crusoe lies, to a great extent, 
in its detail. One either reads the story carefully or 
not at all; but as soon as interest has been aroused, each 
statement or description must be pondered over and 
checked, as far as possible. Then comes the inevitable 
question: “How far was Daniel Defoe relying upon fact, 
how far using his wonderful powers of imagination?" 
And, in searching for an answer to this double question, 
we encounter the name of Alexander Selkirk, who is 
generally regarded as the “prototype" of Robinson 
Crusoe. 

He was a Scottish sailor, a native of Largo, Fifeshire, 
and was born in 1676. In May 1703 he joined Captain 
Dampier in a privateering expedition to the South 
Seas, acting as sailing master of the galley Cinque Ports , 
which, in September, put in at Juan Fernandez Island, 
west of Valparaiso. After a dispute with his captain 
Selkirk was put ashore at his own request with a few 
necessaries, and he lived on the island for four years and 
four months. He was taken off by Captain Woodes 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 


264 

Rogers of the Duke privateer and returned to London 
in 1711. He afterwards went to sea again and died in 
1721 as master's mate of H.M.S. Weymouth . The story 
of his adventure was published in several books 1 before 
the appearance of Robinson Crusoe in 1719, and the 
author had met Selkirk at Bristol and heard his story 
from his own mouth. Moreover, Selkirk afterwards 
said that he had handed over his papers to Defoe, who 
kept to the main outline of Selkirk's story, but makes 
his island more tropical, while he invented the story of 
the cannibals* visits. In 1713 Richard Steele, the 
essayist and associate of Addison, wrote a short essay on 
the adventurer and his story, which appeared in the 
Englishman. In this paper we read that “his portion 
was a sea-chest, his wearing clothes and bedding, a 
firelock, a pound of gunpowder, a large quantity of 
bullets, a flint and steel, a few pounds of tobacco, a 
hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a Bible and other books of 
devotion ; together with pieces that concerned navigation, 
and his mathematical instruments.*' 

“When I first saw him,** Steele continues, “ I thought, 
if I had not been let into his character and story, I could 
have discerned that he had been much separated from 
company, from his aspect and gestures; there was a 
strong but cheerful seriousness in his looks, and a certain 
disregard to the ordinary things about him, as if he had 
been sunk in thought. When the ship which brought 
him off the island came in, he received them with the 
greatest indifference with relation to the prospect of 
going off with them, but with great satisfaction in an 
opportunity to help and refresh them.

COMMENTARY AND QUESTIONS 265 

"This plain man's story is a memorable example that 
he is happiest who confines his wants to natural neces- 
sities, and he that goes further in his desires increases 
his wants in proportion to his acquisitions; or, to use 
his own expression, *1 am now worth eight hundred 
pounds, but shall never be so happy as when I was not 
worth a farthing." 1 


A LETTER FROM CHARLES LAMB 

Those of you who are no longer juniors will like to 
know more about a book than just the story it tells. 
You will be interested to know what great men thought 
about it — especially men who were themselves distin- 
guished writers. Now Charles Lamb was a great writer, 
and had a very great love for what is called style. He 
studied style in other men, and his own style is "just 
like himself," as we say. It should interest you — 
those of you who are no longer juniors — to hear what he 
thought about Defoe's style. So here is a letter from 
Charles Lamb to a friend; and the subject of the letter 
is Robinson Crusoe: 

"E. I. H. 16th Dec. 1822. 

"Dear Wilson, 

" Lightning I was going to call you. You must have 
thought me negligent in not answering your letter 
sooner. But I have a habit of never writing letters but 
at the office; 'tis so much time cribbed out of the Com- 
pany: and I am just got out of the thick of a tea-sale, in 
which most of the entry of notes, deposits, etc. usually 
falls to my share. 

"I have nothing of De Foe's but two or three novels 
and the Plague History . I can give you no information

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


about him. As a slight general character of what I 
remember of them, (for I have not looked into them 
latterly,) I would say that in the appearance of truth , 
in all the incidents and conversations that occur in them, 
they exceed any works of fiction I am acquainted with. 
It is perfect illusion. The author never appears in these 
self-narratives, (for so they ought to be called, or rather 
autobiographies,) but the narrator chains us down to an 
implicit belief in every thing he says. There is all the 
minute detail of a log-book in it. Dates are painfully 
pressed upon the memory. Facts are repeated over and 
over in varying phrases, till you cannot choose but 
believe them. It is like reading evidence given in a 
court of justice. So anxious the story-teller seems that 
the truth should be clearly comprehended, that when he 
has told us a matter of fact or a motive, in a line or two 
farther down he repeats it, with his favourite figure of 
speech, ‘I say/ so and so, though he had made it 
abundantly plain before. This is in imitation of the 
common people’s way of speaking, or rather of the way 
in which they are addressed by a master or mistress 
who wishes to impress something upon their memories, 
and has a wonderful effect upon matter-of-fact readers. 
Indeed it is to such principally that he writes. His 
style is everywhere beautiful, but plain and homely 
Robinson Crusoe is delightful to all ranks and classes 
but it is easy to see that it is written in phraseology 
peculiarly adapted to the lower conditions of readers; 
hence it is an especial favourite with seafaring men, 
poor boys, servant-maids, etc. His novels are capital 
kitchen-reading, while they are worthy, from their 
deep interest, to find a shelf in the libraries of the 
wealthiest and the most learned. His passion for matter - 
oj-fact narrative sometimes betrayed him into a long 



COMMENTARY AND QUESTIONS 267 

relation of common incidents, which might happen to 
any man, and have no interest but the intense appearance 
of truth in them, to commend them. The whole latter 
half or two-thirds of Colonel Jack is of this description. 
The beginning of Colonel Jack is the most affecting 
natural picture of a young thief that was ever drawn. 
His losing the stolen money in the hollow of a tree, and 
finding it again when he was in despair, and then being 
in equal distress at not knowing how to dispose of it, 
and several similar touches in the early history of the 
Colonel, evince a deep knowledge of human nature; 
and putting out of question the superior romantic interest 
of the latter, in my mind very much exceed Crusoe. 
Roxana (first edition) is the next in interest, though he 
left out the best part of it in subsequent editions from 
a foolish hypercriticism of his friend Southeme. But 
Moll Flanders , the Account of the Plague, etc. are all of 
one family, and have the same stamp of character. 
Believe me, with friendly recollections, Brother , (as I 
used to call you,) 


‘Yours, 


"C. Lamb.” 




1. How did the Crusoes get their queer name, and 
why was the hero of the book called Robinson? Where 
did they live, and from what port did he start on his 
first voyage?

collected by Robinson Crusoe from the wreck and taken

part of Defoe to tell the reader what the island was like.) 

6. “ O drug! What art thou good for? Thou art not 
worth to me, no, not the taking off of the ground.” 
What is this about ?
