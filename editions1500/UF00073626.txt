ROBINSON CRUSOE.

I was born in York, in the year 1632, of a reputable
family. My father was a native of Bremen; who by mer-
chandising at Hull for some time, gained a very plentiful
fortune. He married my mother at York, who received
her first breath in that country: and as her maiden name was
Robinson, I was called Robinson Kreutznaer, which not
being easily pronounced in the English tongue, we are
commonly known by the name of Crusoe.

I was the youngest of three brothers. The eldest was a
lieutenant-colonel in Lockhart's regiment, but slain by the
Spaniards; what became of the other I could never learn.

No charge nor pains were wanting in my education.
My father esigned me for the law, yet nothing could serve
me but I must go to sea, both against the will of my father,
the tears of my mother, and the entreaties of friends. One
morning, my father expostulated very warmly with me.
What reason, says he, have you to leave your native coun-
try, where there must be a more certain prospect of con-
tent and happiness, to enter into a wandering condition of
uneasiness and uncertainty? He recommended to me
Agar's wish, neither to desire poverty nor riches; that a
middle state of life was the most happy; and that the high
towering thoughts of raising our condition by wandering
abroad, were surrounded with misery and danger, and
often ended with confusion and disappointment. l entreat
you, nay, 1 command you (says he,) to desist from these
intentions. If you will go, (added he,) my prayers sliall,
however, be offered for your preservation; but a time may
come, when desolate, oppressed, or forsaken, you may wish
you had taken your poor despised father's counsel.--He
pronounced these words with such a moving and paternal
eloquence, while floods of tears ran down his aged cheeks,
that it seemed to stem the torrent of my resolution. But
this soon wore off; and a little after, I informed my mother
that I could not settle at any business, my resolutions were
so strong to see the world, and begged she would gain my
father's consent only to go one voyage; which if it did not
prove prosperous, I would never attempt a second. But
my desire was as vain as my folly in asking. My mother
passionately expressed her dislike to this proposal, telling
me that as she saw I was bent on my own destruction, con-
trary to their will and my duty, she would say no more, but
leave me to myself to do whatever I pleased.

I was then, Ithink, nineteen years old, when one time
being at Hull, I met a school-fellow of mine going along
with his father, who was master of a ship, to London; and
ac quainting him with my wandering desires, he assured me
of a. free passage, and a plentiful share of what was neces'
sary. Thus, without imploring a blessing, or taking Fare--
well of my parents, I took shipping on the lat of Septem-
ber, 165l.

Upon the 6th day, we came to an anchor in Harwich
road, where we lay wind--bound with some Newcastle ships;ROBINSON'S ELOPBMENT FROM "18 PARENTS; FIRST ADVENTURES

and there being a good anchorage, and our cables sound,
the seamen forgot their late toil and danger, and spent the
time as merrily as if they had been on shore: But on the
eighth day, there arose a brisk gale of wind, which pre
vented our tiding it up the river; and it still increasing,
our ship rode forecastle in, and shipped several large seas

It was not long before horror seized the seamen them-
selves, and I heard the master express this melancholy
ejaculation, Lord have mercy upon us, we shall all be lost
and undone! For my part, sick unto death, I kept my
cabin, till the universal and terribly dreadful apprehensions
of our speedy fate made me get upon deck, and there I
was afi'righted indeed. The sea Went mountains high: I
could see nothing but distress around us: two ships had
cut away their meta, and another had foundered; two
more that had lost their anchors, were forced out to the
mercy of the ocean; and, to save our lives, we were forced
to cut our foremast and inainmast quite away.

Who is there so ignorant as not to judge of my dreadful
condition? Iwas but a fresh-water sailor, and therefore
seemed more terrified. Our ship was very good, but
overloaded; which made the sailors often or out, She
will founder: words I then was ignorant o . All this
while, the storm continuing, and rather increasing, the
master and the more sober part of the men went to prayers,
expecting death every moment. In the middle of t e night
one cried out, We had sprung a leak: another, That there
was four feet water in the hold. I was 'ust ready to ex-
pire with fear, when immediately all but s were called to
the pump; and the men forced me also in that extremity to
share with them in their labor. While thus employed, the
master espyiu some colliers, fired a gun as as' al of
distress; and not understandingwhatitmeant,>> thin]!
 

ing that either the ship broke, or some dreadful thing hap<<
pened, fell into nswoon. Even in that condition of we,
nobody minded me, excepting to thrust me aside with their
feet, thinking me dead; and it was a great while before I t
recovered.

Happy it was for us, when upon the signal given, they
ventured out their boat to save our lives. All our pump-
ing had been in vain, and vain had all our attempts been,
had they not come to our ship's side, and our men cast them
a rope over the stem with a bouy to it, which alter great
difficulty they got hold of, and we hauling them to us, got
into their boat, and left our ship which we perceived sink
within less than a quarter of an hour; and thus I learnt
what was meant by thundering at sea. And now the men
incessantly labored to recover their own ship; but the sea
ran so high, and the wind blew so hard, that they thought
it convenient to haul in shore, which with great difficulty
and den or at last we happily efl'ected, landing at a place
called rotner, not far from \Viuterton light-house; from
whence we all walked to Yarmouth, where, as objects of
pity, many good people furnished us with the necessaries
to carry us either to Hell, or London.

Strange ! that after all this, 1 did not, like the prodigal
son, return to my father; who hearing of the ship's calam-
ity, for a long time thought me entombed in the deep. No
doubt but I should have shared in his fatted calf, as the
Scripture expresseth it; but my wayward disposition still
pushed me on, in spite of the powerful convictions of rea-
son and conscience. When we had been at Yarmouth
three days I met my old companion, who had given me the
invitation to go on board along with his father. His beha-
viour and speech was altered, and, in a melancholy manner
he asked me how I did? telling his father who I was. andaoamloa caosor. 7

how I had made this voyage for a trial only to proceed
farther abroad. Upon which the old gentleman turning
to me, said, You man, you ought never to go to sea any
more, but to take t is for a certain sign, that you will never
prosper in a sea-faring condition. Sir, answered I, will
you take the same resolution? It is a difl'erent case, said

e, it is my calling, and consequently my duty; but as you
have made this voyage for a trial, on see what ill luck
heaven has set before your eyes; an perhaps our miseries
have been on your account,--like Jonah in the ship of Tar-
shiah. But pray what are you, and on what account did
you go to sea? Upon which, I very freely declared my
whole story; at the end of which he made this exclamation,
Ye sacred powers! what had I committed, that such a.
wretch should enter into my ship, to heap upon me such a
deluge of miseries? But soon recollecting himself, Young
men, said he, if you do not go back, depend upon it, wher-
ever you go, you will meet with disasters, and disappoint-
ments, till your father's words are fulfilled upon you. And
so we parted.

I thou ht at first to return home; but shame opposed
that go notion, as thinking I should he laughed at by my
neighbors and acquaintances. So stran e is the nature
of youth! They are not ashamed to sin, ut yet ashamed
to repent; and so far from being sorry for those actions for
which they may be accounted fools, they think it folly to
return to their duty, which is the principal mark of wisdom.
In short, I travelled up to London, resolving upon a voy-

e, and a voyage I soon heard of, by my acquaintance
wrth a captain who took a fancy to me, to go to the coast
of Guinea. Having some money and appearing like a

entleman, I went on board, not as a common sailor or
oremast-man; nay, the commander agreed I should gofl

8 LIFE AND anveu'waas or

that voyage with him without any expense; that I should
be his messmate and companion, and that I was welcome
to carry any thing with me, and make the best merchan-
dise I could.

I blessed my happy fortune, and humb.y thanked my
captain for his offer, and acquainting my friends in York-
shire, forty pounds were sent me, the greatest part of which ,
my dear father and mother contributed, with which I bought
toys and trifics as the captain directed me. My captain
also taught me navigation, how to keep an account of the
ship's course, take an observation, and led me into the
knowledge of several useful branches of the mathematics.
And indeed this voyage made me both a sailor and a mer-
chant; for I brought home five pound nine ounces of gold
dust, for my adventure, which produced, at my return to
London, almost three hundred pounds; but in this voyage
Iwas extremely sick, being thrown into a violent fever,
through excessive heat, trading upon the coast from the
latitude of fifteen degrees north, even to the line itself.

But, alas! my dear friend the captain soon departed this
life after his arrival. This was a sensible grief to me;
yet I resolved to go another voyage with his mate, who
had now got command of the ship. This proved a very
unsuccessful one; for though 1 did not carry ahundred
pounds of my late acquired wealth, (so that 1 had two
hundred pounds left, which I reposed with the captain's
widow, who was an honest gentlewoman,) yet my misfor-
tunes in this unhappy voyage were very great. For on
ship sailing towards the Canary Islands, we were chased by
a Salee rover; and in spite of all the haste we could make
by crowding as much canvass as our yards could spread,
or our masts carry, the pirate gained upon us, so that we
prepared ouraeives to fight. Thev had eighteen guns, andROBINSON onusos. ' 9

we had but twelve. About three in the afternoon there
was a desperate engagement, wherein many were killed
and wounded on both sides: but finding ourselves over-
powered with numbers, our ship disabled, and ourselves
too impotent to have the least hopes of success, we were
forced to surrender; and accordin ly we were all carried
risouers into the port of Sales. ur men were sent to the
Emperor's court to be sold there; but the pirate captain
taking notice of me, kept me to be his own slave.

In this condition, I thought myself the most miserable
creature on earth, and the Ipimphccy of my father came
afresh into my thoughts. owever, my condition, was
better than I thought it to be, as will soon appear. Some
hopes, indeed, I had that my new patron would go to sea
again, where he might be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese
man of war, and then I should be set at liberty. But in
this I was mistaken; for he never took me with him, but
left me to look after his little garden, and do the drudgery
of his house, and when he returned from sea, would make
me he in the cabin and look after the ship. I had no one
that I could communicate my thoughts to, which were con-
tinually meditating my escape. No Englishman, Irishman,
or Scotchman here but myself: and for two years I could
see nothing practicable, but only pleased myself with the
imagination.

After some length of time, my patron as I found, grew
so poor, that he could not fit out his ship as usual; and
then he used constantly, once or twice a week, if the
weather was fair, to go out a fishing, taking me and a
young Moorish boy to row the boat; and so much pleased
was he with me for my dexterity in catching the fish, that
he would often send me with a Moor, who was one of hi!

kinsmen, and the youth before-mentioned, to catch a dial
of fish 6" "tr
 

One morning, as we were at sport, there arose such a
thick fog, that we lost sight of the shore; and rowing, we
knew not which way, we labored all the night, and in the
mornin we found ourselves in the ocean, two leagues from
land. owever, we attained there at length, and made
the greatest haste, because our stomachs were exceedingly
sharp and hungry. In order to prevent such disasters for
the future, my patron ordered a carpenter to build a little
state--room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat: with a
place behind it to steer and haul home the mainsheet, with
other conveniences to keep him from the weather, as also
lockers to put. in all manner of provisions; with ahundsome
shoulder-of-mutton sail gibing over the cabin.

In this, he frequently took us out a fishing; and one
time, inviting two or three persons of distinction to go with
him, laid in provisions extraordinary; providing also three
t'usees, with powder and shot, that they might have some
sport t'owling along the seacoast. The next morning, the
boat was made clean, her ancients and pendants out, and
every thing ready: but their minds altering, my patron
ordered us to go a fishing, for that his guests would cer-
tainly sup with him that night. '

And now I began to think of my deliverance indeed. In
order to this, I persuaded the Moor to get some provisions
on board, and to procure some powder and shot, pretending
to kill sea-curlews, which he innocently and readily agreed
to. In short, being provided with all things necessary,
we sailed out.

When we had passed the castle, we fell to fishing; but
though I knew there was a bite, I concealed the matter, in
order to put farther out to sea. Accordingly we ran a
league farther, when, giving the boy the helm, and preten-
ding to stoop for something. I seized Muley by surpriseROBINSON 630803. II

and threw him overboard. As he was an excellent swun-
mer, he soon arose and made towards the boat; upon which
I took out a fuses, and presented it at him: " Muley," said
I, " I never yet designed to do you any harm, and seek
nothing now but my freedom. I know you are able enough
to swim to shore, and save your life; but if you are resolv-
ed to follow me to the endangering of mine, the very mo-
ment you proceed, I will shoot you through the head."
The harmless creature, at these words, turned himself from
me and I make no doubt, got safe to land. Then turning
to the boy Xury, I erceived he trembled at the action;
but I put him out 0 all fear, telling him, that if he would
be true and faithful to me, I would do well by him and not
hurt him. '

We then ursued our voyage: I kept to the southward,
to the truly fiarharian coast; but in the dark of the evening,

I changed my course, that I might keep near the shore,
and having a fresh gale of wind, with a very pleasant smooth
sea, by three o'clock next day, I was one hundred and fifty
miles beyond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions. I

continue sailing for five days successively, till such time
.ts the wind shifting to the southward, made me conclude,
hot if any vessel was in chase of me, they would proceed
no farther. -

After so much fatigue and thought, I anchored at tie
mouth of a little river, I knew not what or where, nether
did I then see any eople. What I principally wanted was
fresh water; and fwas resolved about the dusk of the
evening to swim ashore: but no sooner the gloomy clouds
of night began to succeed the declinin'g'day, than we heard
such barking, roaring, and howling a wild creatures, that
one mi ht have thou ht the very strongest monsters of
nature ad their resi once there. Poor Xury. who was. .

[2 LIFE AND ADVENTURES or

almost dead with fear, entreated me not to go on shore
that night. " Suppose I don't Xury," said I, " and in the
morning we should see men who are worse than those we
fear, what then? " " () don we may give them the shoot
gun," said he, laughing, " and the gun make them all run
away." The wit, and broken English which the boy had
learned among the captives of our nation pleased me en-
tirely, and made me still (under of him than before. We
could get but little sleep all night for the terrible howliws
they made; and indeed we were. very much nl'li'ighted.
The next morning, I was. resolved to go on shore to get
in fresh water, and venture myself among the beasts or
savages, should either attack me. Xury said he would
take one of the jars and bring me some. I asked him why
he would go and not I? The poor boy answered, " If wild
mans come, they eat me, you go away." This, indeed,
increased my afl'ection for the child. " \Vell, dear Xury,"
said I, " we will both go ashore, both kill wild mans, and
they shall eat neither of us." So giving Xury a piece of
bread to eat, we waded ashore, carrying nothing with us
but our arms, and two jars for water. I did not go out of
sight of the boat, as dreading the savages coming down the
river in their canoes: but the boy seeing a low descent or
vale about a mile in the country, he wandered to it; and
then running back to me with great precipitation, [thought
he was pursued by some savages or wild beasts; upon
which I approached, resolving to perish, or protect him
from danger. As he came nearer to me, I saw somethin
hanging over his shoulder, which was a creature he held,
shot, like a hare, but difi'erent in color, and with longer
legs; however we were glad of it, for it proved wholesome
and nourishing meat; but what added to our joy was, my
boy assured me there was plenty of water, and that hel,

' saw no wild mans." And greater still was our comfort

when we found fresh water in the creek where we were
when the tide was out, without going so far up into the
li country. '

In this place I began to hope that I should meet some
of the English trading vesselsfivho would relieve and take
us in.

The place I was in, was no doubt, that wild country in
habitcd only by a few, that lies between the Emperor of
Morocco's dominions and the negroes. It is filled with
wild beasts, and the Moors use it for hunting chiefly.
From this place I thought I saw the top of the mountain
Tenerifl'e, in the Canaries, which made me try twice to
attain it, but as often was I driven back, and so forced to
l_ pursue my fortune along shore.

' Early one morning we came to an anchor under a little
point of land, but pretty high; and the tide beginning to
flow, we lay ready to go further in: but Xury whose youth-
ful and penetrating eyes were sharper than mine, in a soft
tone desired me to keep far from land, lest we should be
devoured; " For look yonder master, and see de dreadful
monster fast asleep on de side of de hill." Accordingly
looking where he pointed, I espied a fearful monster in-
deed. [t was a terrible great lion that lay on shore, cover-
ed as it were by a shade of a piece of the hill. " Xury,"
said I, " you shall go on shore and kill him." But the boy
looked amazed. " Me kill him!" says he, " he eat me at
one month," meaning one mouthful. Upon which I bid
1 him lie still, and charging my biggest gun with two slugs,
and a good charge of powder, I took the best aim I could
to shoot him through the head: but his leg lying over his
nose, the slug broke his knee-bone. The lion awaiting
with the pain, got up, but soon fell down, giving the most
hideous groan I ever heard; but taking my second piece I
shot him through the bead, and then he lay struggling for
life. Upon this Xury took heart, and desired my leave to
go on shore. " Go then," said I. Upon which, taking a
little gun in one hand, he swam to shore with the other,
and coming close to the lion put a period to his life, by
shooting him again through the head.

But this was spending our ammunition in vein, the flesh
not being good to eat. Xury was like a champion, and
comes on board for a hatchet to cut off the head of his
enemy; but wanting strength to perform it, he cut ed" and
brought me a foot. I betbougbt me, however, that this
skin would be of use. This cost Xury and me a whole
day: when spreading it on the top of our cabin, the hot
beams of the sun effectually dried it in two days time, and
it afterwards served me for a bed to lie on.

And now we sailed southerly, living sparingly on our
provisions, and went no ottcner on shore than we were
obliged for fresh water, in hopes to meet some European
ship. If providence did not favor me, my next course was
to seek for the islands, or lose my life among the negrocs;
in a word, either I must meet with some ship, or certainly
perish.

One day as we were sailing along, we saw people stand
on the shore looking at us; we could also perceive they
were black, and stark naked. I was inclined to go on
shore; but Xury cried, No, no; however, I approached
nearer, and I found they ran along the shore by me a long
way. They had no weapons in their hands, except one,
who held a long stick, which Xury told me was a lance,
with which they could kill at a great distance. I talked to
them by signs, and made them sensible I wanted somethin
to eat; they beckoned to me to stop my boat, while two 0
tnem ran up into the country, and in less than half an hour
came back and brou ht with them two pieces of dry flesh,
and some corn, whic we kindly accepted; and to prevent
any fears on either side, they brought the food to the shore,
laid it down, then went and stood a great way off, till we
fetched it on board, and then came close to us again.

But while we were returning thanks to them, being all
we could afford, two mighty creatures came from the
mountains, one as it were pursuing the other with great
fury, which we were the rather inclined to believe, as they
seldom appear but in the night, and both these swiftly pas-
sing by the negroes, jumped into the sea, wantonly swim--
ming about, as though the diversion of the waters had put
a stop to their fierceness. At last one of them coming
nearer to my boat than I expected, or desired, I shot him
directly through the head, upon which he sunk immediate-
ly, yet rising again, he would have willingly made to the
shore, but between the wound and the struggling of the
water, he died before he could reach it.

It is impossible to express the consternation the poor
negroes were in at the firing of my gun; much less can I
mention their surprise, when they perceived the creature
to be slain by it. I made signs to them to draw near it
with a rope, and then gave it to them to haul on shore. It
was a beautiful leopard, which made me desire its skin;
and the negroes seeming to covet the carcass, I freely gave
it to them. As for the other leopard, it made to shore, and
ran with a prodigious swifiness out of sight. The negroes
having kindly furnished me with water, and with what roots
and grains their country afforded, I took in leave, and,
after eleven (la a sail came in sight of the ape de Verd.
But the great istance I was from it, and fearing contrary
winds would prevent me reaching them, I began to grow
melancholy and dejected, when upon a sudden Xury cried
out, " Master, Muster," looking as afl'righted as if it was
his master's ship sent in search of us. But I soon dis-
covered she was a Portuguese ship. Upon which I strove
for life to come up to them. But in vain had it been. if
through their perspective glasses, they had not perceived
us, and shortened their sail to let us come in. Encouraged
at this, I set up my patron's ancient, and fired a gun, both
as signals of distress; upon which they very kindly lay to,
so that in three hours time 1 came up with them. They
spoke to me in Portuguese, Spanish, and French, but
none of these did I understand, till at length a Scots sailor'
called, and then I told him I was an Englishman, who had
escaped from the Moors at Salee, upon which they took
me kindly on board, with all my efl'ects.

Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils, we arrived in
the Bay de 'l'odos los Santos, or, All Saints Bay, in twenty-
two days after. And here I cannot forget the generous
treatment of the captain. He would take nothing for my
passage, gave me twenty dueats for the leopard's skin, and
thirty for the lion's. Every thing he caused to be deliver-
ed, and what I would sell, he bought. In short, I made
920 pieces of my cargo, and with this stock I entered once
more, as I may say, into the scene of life.

To be brief, I bought a settlement next to an honest and
kind neighbor, born at Lisbon, of English parents, whose
plantation joining to mine, we improved very amicably to-
gether. Both our stocks were low: and for two years we
planted only for food; but the third year we planted some
tobacco, and each of us dressed a large piece of ground
the ensuing year for planting sugar--canes.

I was in some measure settled, before the captain who
took me up departed from the Brazils. One day I went toaosmsox unusos. 1?

him, and told him what stock I had in London, desiring
his assistance in getting it sent out to me; to which the
good gentleman readily consented, but would only have
me send for half my money, lost it should miscarry, which,
if it did, I might still have the remainder to support me;
and so taking letters of procuration from me, bid me trou-
ble myself no further about it.

And indeed. he not only procured the money I had
drawn (or upon my captain's widow, but sent me over a
servant, with a cargo proportionable to my condition. He
also sent me tools of all sorts, iron work and utensils
necessary for my plantation.

Wealth now increasing on me, and uncommon success
crowning my prosperous labors, I might have rested happy
m that middle state of life my father so often recommended;
yet nothing would content me. Having lived four years in
Brazil, I had not only learned the language, but contracted
acquaintance with the most eminent planters, and even
with the merchants of St. Salvadnrc, three of whom came
one morning to me saying they had a secret proposal to
make. After enjoining me to secrecy, they told me they
had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea, in order to
stock the plantation with negroes, which as they could not
be publicly sold, they would divide among them; and. if I
would go their super-cargo in the ship, to manage the trad
ing part, I should have an equal share of the negroes.
without providing any stock. The thing indeed was fair
enough, had I been in another condition: however, I could
not resist the proposal, but accepted the offer, upon condi
tion of their looking after my plantation.

The ship being fitted out, and all things ready, we set
sail the first of September 1659. We sailed northwarc
upon the coast, from whence going farther into the ocean

Q
out of the sight of land, we steered as though we were
bound for the island Fernand de Noremba, leaving the is-
lands on the east, and then it was we met with a terrible
tempest, which continued for twelve days successively, so
that the winds carried us wheresoever they pleased. In
this perplexity one of our men died, and a man and a boy
were washed overboard. \Vhen the weather cleared up a
little, we found ourselves upon the coast of Guinea. Upon
this the captain gave reasons for returning; which I oppos-
, ed, counselling him to stand away for Barbadoes, which as
I supposed might be attained in fifteen days. So altering
our course, we sailed northwest and by west in order to
reach the Leeward Islands; but a second storm succeeding,
l drove us to the westward, so that we were justly afraid of
falling into the hands of cruel savages, or the paws of the
devouring beasts of prey.

In this great distress, one of the men, early in the morn-
ing, cried out, Land! land! which he had no sooner said,
than our ship struck upon a. sand bank, and, in a moment,
the'sea broke over her in such a manner that we expected
we should perish immediately. We knew not where we
were, or upon what land we were driven, whether it was
an island, or the main, inhabited or not inhabited, and we
could not so much as hope that the ship would hold out
v many minutes, without breaking in pieces, unless the wind
by a miracle should turn about immediately. While we
stood looking at one another, expecting death every mo-
ment, the mate lays hold of the boat, and with the help of
the rest got her flung over the ship's side; into this we all -
got being eleven in number, and committed ourselves to
God's mercy, and the wild sea. And now we saw that this
last effort would not be a sufficient protection from death;
so high did the sea rise, that it was impossible the boat
should live. As to making a sail, we had none, neither if
we had could we make use of any. So that when we had
rowed or rather were driven about a league and a half, a
raging wave, like a lolly mountain came rolling astern of
us, and took us with such fury, that at once it overset the
boat. Thus being swallowed up in' a moment, we had only
time to call upon the awful name of God, and to implore,
in dying ejaculations, his infinite mercy to receive our de-
parting souls.

Men are generally counted insensible, when struggling
in the pangs of death; but while I was overwhelmed with
water, I had the most dreadful apprehensions imaginable,
for the joys of heaven, and the torments of hell, seemed to
present themselves before me in these dying agonies, and
even small space of time, as it were, between life and death.
I was going I thought I knew not whither, in a dismal
gulf unknown, and as yet unperceived, never to behold
my friends, nor the light of this world any more! I strove
however to the last extremity, while all my companions

90 LIFE AND ADVENTURES or

 

began to return, at which I struck forward, and feeling
ground again with my feet, I look to my heels. Thus be-
ing served twice more, I was at last dashed against a piece
of rock, in such a manner as left me senseless, but recover-
ing a little before the return of the wave, which no doubt
would then overwhelm me, I hold fast by the rock till those
succeeding waves abated; and then fetching another run,
was overtaken by a small wave, which was soon conquered.
But before any more could overtake me, I reached the mam
land, where clambering up the cliffs of the shore, tired and
almost spent, I sat down on the grass, free from the danger
of the foaming ocean.

No tongue can express the transports that my soul felt
at this happy deliverance. I was rapt up in contmnplation,
and often filled up my hands with the prol'oundcst humility,
to the Divine Power for saving my life; when the rest of
my companions were all drowned. And now I began to
cast my eyes around. and to behold what plaeel was in,
and what I had next to do. I could see no house nor peo-
ple; I was wet, yet had no clothes to shift me; hungry and
thirsty, yet had nothing to eat or drink, no weapon to de-
stroy any creature for my sustenance, nor defend myself
against devouring beasts; in short I had nothing but a knife,
a tobacco pipe, and a box hall' filled with tobacco. The
darksome night coming upon me, increased my fears of be-
ing devoured by wild creatures, my mind was plunged into
despair, and having no prospect, as I thought, of life be-
fore me, I prepared for another kind of death than what I
had lately escaped. I walked about a furlong, to see if I
could find any fresh water, which I did, to my great joy;
and taking a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger, I got as
into a thick bushy tree, and seating myself so that 1 coal
not fall, a deep sleep overtook me, and for that night, buri-

ed my sorrows in a quiet repose.
It was broad day the next morning before I awoke, when
I not only perceived the tempest was ceased, but saw the
ship driven almost as far as the rock before-mentioned,
which was about a mile from the place where I was.--
W'hen I came down from my apartment in the tree, I per-
ceived the ship's bnnt two miles distant on my right hand,
lying on shore as the waves had cast her. I thought to
have got to her; but there being an inlet of water about
hull" a mile's breadth between it and me, I returned again
towards the ship, as hoping to find something for my more
immediate subsistence. About noon when the sea vas
so calm that I could come within a quarter of a mile of er,
it was to my grief I perceived, that if we had kept on board,
all our lives would have been saved. These thoughts, and
my solitude, drew tears from my eyes, though all in vain.
So resolving to get to the ship, I stripped and leaped into
the water; when swimming round her, I was afraid I could
not get any thing to lay hold of; but it was my good for-
tune to espy a small piece of rope hangin down so low,
that, by the hel of it, though with great ifficulty, I got
into the ship. are I found that the ship was bilged, and
had a great deal of water in her, her stern was lifted up
against a bank, and her head almost in the water. 'AJl her
quarter, and what was there, were free and dry. The pro-
visions I found in good order, and losing no time, ate while
I was doing other things. I also found some rum, of which
I took a little; and now I wanted for nothing except a boat,
which indeed was all, to carry away what was needful for
me.

Necessity occasions a quickness of thought. We had
several spare yards, a spare topmast or two, and two or
three large spars of wood. With these I fell to work, and
slung as many of them overboard as I could manage, tying
every one of them with a rope that they might not drive
away. This done, I went down the ship's side and tied
four of them fast together at both ends, in form of a raft,
and laying two or three short pieces of plank upon them
cross ways, I found it would bear me but not any consid--
erable weight. Upon which I went to work again, cuttin

a spare topmast into three lengths, adding them to my rag
with a great deal of labor and pains. I then first laying
upon it all the planks and boards I could et, next lowered
down three of the seamen's chests after had filled them
with bread, rice, three Dutch cheese, five pieces of dried
goat's flesh, and some European corn, what little the rats
had spared; and for liquors, I found several cases of bottles,
in which were some cordial waters, and four or five gallons
of arrack. By this time the tide beginning to flow, I per-
ceived my coat, waistcoat and shirt swim away which I had
left on shore; as for my linen breeches and stockings, I
swam with them to the ship; but I soon found clothes
enough, though I took no more than I wanted for the pres-
ent. My eyes were chiefly on tools to work with, and af-
ter a long search, I found out the carpenter's chest, whicl
I got safe down on my raft. I then looked for arms an

ammunition, and in the great cabin, found two good fowl
ing pieces, two pistols, several powder horns filled, a small
bag of shot, and two rusty swords. I likewise found three
barrels of powder, two of which were good, but the third
had taken water, also two or three broken oars, two saws
an axe, and a hammer. I then put to sea, and in getting
to shore had three encouragements. l. A smooth calm sea:
2. The tide rising and setting in to the shore: 3. The lit-
tle wind there was, blowing towards land: After I had
sailed about a mile, I found the raft driving a little distance
from the place where I first landed, and when I perceivedROBXKSON FINDS HIMSELF ()N A DESOLAI'E ISLAND; PROCURES

an opening of the land, with a strong current of the tide
running into it, upon which I kept the middle of the stream.
But great was my concern, when on a sudden the forepart
of my raft ran aground. But after some time, the rising
of the water caused the raft to float again, and comin up
a little river, with land on both sides, I landed in aIittle
cave, as near the mouth as possible, the better to discover
a sail, if any such providentially passed that way.

Not far off, I espied a hill of stupendous height, sur-
rounded with smaller hills about it, and thither I was re-
solved to go and view the country, that I might see what
part was best to fix my habitation in. Accordingly, armin
myself with a pistol, a fowling lece, powder, and ball,
ascended the mountain. There leercewed I was in an is-

land, encompassed by the sea, no distant lands to be seen,
but scattering rocks that bay to the west; that it seemed to

be a barren place, and as thought only inhabited by wild
beasts. I perceived abundance of fowls, but was i norant
of what kind, or whether good for nourishment. I s at one
of them at my return, which occasioned a confused scream-
ing among the other birds, and I found it, by its color and
beak, to be a kind of hawk, but its flesh was perfect carrion.

When I came to my raft I brought my effects on shore,
which work spent that day entirely; and fearin that some
cruel beast mi ht devour me in the night time w ile I slept,
I made a kin of hut, or barricade, with the chests and
boards I had brought on shore. That night I slept very
comfortably; and. the next morning my thoughts were
employed to make a further attempt to the ship, and bring
away what necessaries I could find, before another storm
should break her in pieces. Accordingly, I got on board
asbefore, and pre ared a second raft far better than the
first; upon which, brought away the carpenter's stores
two or three bags full ol' nails, (1 great jack--screw, a dozen
or two of hatchets, and a grind-stone. I also took two or
three iron crows, two barrels of musket-bullets, another
l'owling piece, a small quantity of powder, and a large bag
full at small shot. Besides these, I took all the men's
clothes I could find, a spare l'ore-top-sail, a hammock, and
some bedding; and thus completing my second cargo, I
made all the haste on shore I could, fearing some wild
beast might destroy what I had there already. But I only
found a little wild cat sitting on one of the chests, who not
seeming to fear me or the gun that I presented at her, I *
threw her a piece of biscuit, which she instantly ate and
departed.

When I had got these eti'ects on shore, I went to work,
in order to make me a little tent with the sail and some
poles, which I had cut for the purpose, and having finished
it, what things might be damaged by the weather, I brought
in, piling all the empty chests and casks in a circle, the
better to fortify it against any sudden attempt of man or
beast. After this 1 blocked up the doors with some boards,
and an empty chest turned the long way out. I then
charged my gun and pistol, and laying my bed'on the ground,
slept as comfortably till the next morning, as though I had
been in a christian country.

Now, though I had enough to subsist me a long time,
yet despairing of a sudden deliverance, and fearing that
both ammunition and provision might be spent before such
a thing happened, 1 saved as much as I- could, and so long
as the ship remained in that condition, I daily brought away
one necessary or other; particularly, the rigging, sails, and
cordage, some twine, a barrel of wet powder, some sugar,
a barrel of meal, three casks of rum, and indeed what was
most welcome to me, a whole hogshead of bread.
The next time I went, I cut the cables in pieces, carried
ofl' a hulser whole, with a great deal of iron work, and
made another raft; but this being so unwieldy, by the too
heavy burden upon it, and I not being able so dexterously
to guide it as the former, both my cargo and myself were
overturned. For my part all the damage I sustained was
a wet skin; and at low wutcr, after much labor in diving,
I got up most of the cables, and some pieces of iron.
Thirteen days had I now been on the island, and eleven
days on board, bringing away all that was possible. As
I was going the twellth time, the wind began to rise;
however, I ventured at low water, and rummaging the cabin,
in a locker, I found several razors, scissors, and some
dozens of knives and forks, and in another, thirty--six pounds
in pieces of eight, silver and gold. I \vrapt the money up
in a piece of canvass, and began to think of making an-
other rafi; but I soon perceived the wind beginning to rise,
a fresh gale blowing from the shore, and the sky overcast
with clouds and darkness. So thinkinga raft to be in vain,
I let myself into the water with what things I had about me;
and it was with great difiicultyl got ashore, when soon
after it blew a fearful storm.

That ni ht I slept very eontentedly in my little tent,
surrounde with all my effects; but whenI looked out in
the morning, no more ship was to be "seen. This much
sur rised me for the present: yet, when I considered thatI
had? lost no time, abated no pains, and had got every thing

useful out of her, I comforted m self in the best manner,
and entirely submitted to divine rovidence.

My next thoughts were, how I should defend and secure
myself from savages and wild beasts, if any such were in
the island.

When I considered the ground where I was, that it was
marshy, and had no fresh water near it, my resolutions
were to search for a soil healthy and well watered, where I
might not only be sheltered from the sun's scorching: heat,
but be more conveniently situated, as well to be secured
from wild men, and boasts of prey, as more easily to dis-
cover any distnnt sail, should it ever so happen.

And indeed it was not long before I had my desire. I
timnd a little plain near a rising: hill, the front. towards
which, being as steep us a house-side, nothing could descend
on me from the top.

0n the. side of this rock was a little hollow place, resem-
bling the entrance or door of a cave. Just before this
place, on the circle ofthegl'een, I resolved my tent should
stand. This plnin did not much exceed a hundred yards
broad, and about twice as long, like u. delightful green
before my door, with a pleasing, though irregular descent
every wny to the. low grounds by the seaside, sheltered
ti'om the excessive heat of the sun. After this, I drew a
semicircle, twenty yards in diameter, driving down two rows
of strong stakes not six int-hes from each other. Then,
with the pieces of cable which I had cut on board, I regu-
larly laid them in a circle between the piles, up to their tops,
which were. more than time feet out of the earth, and then
drove another row of piles, looking within side against them,
between two or three feet high, which made me conclude it
a little castle, impregnablc by men and beasts. And for my
better security I Would have. no door, but entered in and
came out by the help of n ladder, which I also made.

Here was my fence and fortress, into which I carried all
my riches, ammunition and stores. After which, working
on the rock, what with the dirt and stones I dug out, I not
only raised my ground two feet, but made a little cellar to
my mansion-house; and this cost me many days labor and
pains. One day in particular, a shower of rain falling,
thunder and lightning ensued, which put me in terror lest
my powder should take fire, and not only hinder my neces-
sary subsistence, by killing my food, but even blow up me
and my habitation. To prevent which,1 fell to making
boxes and bags, in order to separate it, having by me near
l501b. weight. And thus being established as king of the
island, every day I went out with my gun to see what I
could kill that was fit to eat. I soon perceived numbers of
goats, but very shy; yet having watched them narrowly,
and seeing I could better shoot of? the rocks than when in
the low grounds, I happened to shoot a she-goat suckling
a young kid; which, not thinking its dam slain, stood by
her unconcerned; and when 1 took the dead creature up,
the young one followed me even to the enclosure. I lifted
the kid over the poles, and would willingly have kept it alive,
but finding it could not be brought to eat, I was forced to
slay it also for my subsistence.

Thus, entered into as strange a state as ever any man
was in, I had most melancholy apprehensions concernin
my deplorable condition; and many times the tears woul
plentit'ully run down my face, when I considered how I was
debarred from all communication with human kind. Yet
while these desponding cogitations would seem to' make me
accuse Providence, other good thouflifts would interpose
and reprove me after this manner; " ell, supposing you
are desolate, is it not better to be so, than totally perish?
Why should you complain, when not only your life is pre-
served, but the ship driven into your reach, in order to
take what was necessary out of her for a subsistence?"
But to proceed: it was, by the account I kept, the thirtieth
of September, when I first landed on this island. About
twelve days after, fearing last I should lose my reckoning

JOURNAL.

SarTaMIIEII 30th, 1659, I, unhappy Robinson Crusoe,
having sullercd shipwreck, \I as driven on this desolate isl-
and, which I named the Desolutc Island oI Despair, the
rest ol my companions being swallowed up in the tempest-
nIms occult. The next day I spent in consideration of my
unhappy circumstances, IIIIVIIIH' no prospect but of death,
either to be starved ivith huIIIver, or devoured by wild
beasts or merciless savages.
Oct. 1. That morning, with great comfort, I beheld the
ship drove ashore. Some hopes I had, that when the
storm was abated I might be able to get some food and
necessaries out of her; which I conceived were not dam-
aged, because the ship did stand upright. At this time, I
lamented the less of my companions, and our misfortune
in leavinn the vessel. When I perceived the ship, as it
vere, to Iie dry, I waded through the sands, then swam
aboard, the weather being very rainy, and with scarcely
any wind.

Po the 14th of this month, my time was employed in
making Voyages every tide, getting what I could out of the
ship. The weather very wet and uncertain.

Oct. 15. My raft, and all the goods thereon were over-
sct', yet I recovered most again at low water.

Oct. 25. It blew hard, and rained night and day, when
the ship went in pieces, so that nothing was seen of her
but the wreck at low water. This day I secured my goods
from the inclemency of the weather.

Oct. '26. I wandered to see where I could find a place
convenient for my abode: I fixed upon a rock in the eve-
ning, marked out a half moon, intending to erect a wall
fortified with piles, lined within with pieces of cables, and
covered with turf.

Nov. 3. I shot two wild-fowls, resembling ducks, which
were good to eat, and in the afternoon made me a table.

Nov. 4. I began to live regularly. In the morning I
allowed myself two or three hours to walk out with my
gun; I then worked till near eleven o'clock; and after-
wards refreshed myself with what I had to eat. From
twelve to two, I would lie down to sleep. Extreme sultry
weather. In the evening go to work again.

Nov. 5. Went out with my gun and dog, shot a wild cat
with a soft skin, but her flesh was good for nothing. The
skins of "1th killed 1 prescI-Ied. On my return I perceiv-

ed many wild birds, and was terrified by some seals which

Dec. 20. Every thing I got into its place, then made a
sort of dresser, and another table.

Dec. 27. I chanced to light on some goats, shot one,
wounded another; I led it home in a string, bound up its
leg, and cured it in a little time; at length, it became so
tame and familiar as to feed before .he door, and follow
me where I pleased. This put me m mind to bring up
tame creatures, in order to supply me with food after my
ammunition was spent.

Dec. .228, 29, 30. The weather being excessively hot,
with little air, obliged me for the most part to keep within
doors.

Jan. 8, to 14. My employment this time was to finish
the well before described, and search the island. I discov-
ered a kind of pigeons, like our house-pigeons, in a nest
among the rocks. I brought them home, nursed them till
they could fly, and then they left me. After this, I shot
some, which proved excellent food. Some time I spent
vainly contriving to make a cask, I may well say it was in
vain, because I could neither joint the staves, nor fix the
heads, so as to make it tight; so leaving that, I took some
goat's tallow I had by me, and a little oakum for the wick,
and provided myself with a lamp, which served instead of
candles.

But now a very strange event happened. For being in
the height of my search, what should come into my hand,
but a bag which was used to hold corn (as I supposed,)
for the fowls; so immediately resolving to put gunpowder
into it, I shook all the huaks and dirt upon one side of
a rock, little expecting what the consequence would be.
The rain had fallen plentifully a few days before; and
about a month alter, to my great amazement, somethin
began to look out very green and flourishing; and when

came to view it. more nicely, every day as it grew, I found I

about ten or twelve ears of green barley of the very same
. shape :md make as that in England.
. I can scarcely express the agitation of my mind at this

sight. Hitherto, I had looked upon the actions of this life ,
. no otherwise than only as the events of blind chance and
' fortune. But now, the appearance ofthis barley, llourish-
I ing in a barren soil, and my ignorance in not conceiving
I how it should come there, made me conclude, " that mira-
cles were not yet eeased;" nay, I even thought. that God
had appointed it to grow there without any seed, purely for
my sustenance in this miserable and desolate island. And i
indeed such great ell'ect had this upon me, that it often
made me melt into tears through a grateful sense of God's
mercies; and the greater still was my thankfulness, when
l perceived about this little tield of barley, some rice stalks,
; also wonderfully flourishing.

\Vhile thus pleased in mind, I concluded there must be
some more com in the island; and therefore made a dili-
gent search narrowly among the rocks; but not being able
to lind any, on a sudden it came into my mind, how I had
shaken the lmsks of corn out of the bag and then my
| admiration ceased, with my gratitude to the Divine Being,
as thinking it was but natural, and not to be conceived a
' miracle; though even the manner of its preservation might
have made me own it as a wonderful event of God's kind
i providence.

fatigable pains and industry for three or four months, at
last Ifinished my house on the 14th of April, having no
way to go into it, but by a ladder against the wall.

flpril 16. I finished my ladder, and ascended it; after-
wards pulled it up, then let it down on the other side, and
descended into my new habitation, where I had space
enough, and so fortified, that nothing could attack me
without scaling the walls.

But what does all human art and industry avail, if the
blessing of God does not crown our labors? Or who can
stand before the Almighty, when he stretcheth forth his
arm? For, one time as I was at the entrance of my cave,
there happened such a dreadful earthquake, that not only
the roof ofthe cave came tumblin about my ears, but the
posts seemed to crack terribly at t e same time. This put
me _in a great amazement; and running to the ladder and
getting over the wall, I then plainly knew it was an earth-
quake, the place I stood on sustaininn thrce terrible shocks
in less than three minutes. But ju go of my terror when
I saw the top of a great rock roll into the sea; I then ex-
pected the island would be swallowed up every moment:
and what made the scene still more dreadful, was to see
the sea thrown into the most violent agitations and disor-
ders by this tremendous accident.

For my part, I expected every moment to be swallowed
up. At the moving of the earth, I was, as it were, sea-
sick; and very much afraid lest the rock, under which was
my fence and habitation, should overwhelm me and it in a
lasting tomb.

It was not long after, when a horrible tempest arose at
the same time attended with a hurricane of wind. Three
hours did this storm continue, and in so violent a manner
as to tear the very trees up by the roots, which was suc-
eeeded by abundance of rain. When the tempest was
over, I went to my tent; but the rain coming on in a furious
manner, I was obliged to take shelter in the care, where I
was forced to cut a channel through my fortification, to
let the water out. It continued raining,r all that night, and
some time the next day. These accidents made me re-
solve, as soon as the Weather cleared up, to build me a
little lult in some open place, walled round, to defend me
from wild creatures and savages; not doubting, but at the
next earthquake, the mountain would fall on my habitation
and me, and swallow up all in its bowels.

flpril 16--20. These days I spent in contriviug how
and in what manner I should fix my place of abode. All
this while, I was under the most dreadful apprehensions.
\Vhen I looked round my habitation, every thing Ifound
in its proper place. I had several debates whether I should
move or not; but at length resolved to stay where I was,
till I found out a convenient place where I might pitch my
tent.

leril 22. When I began to put my resolutions in prac-
tice, I was stopped for want of tools and instruments to
work with. Most of my axes and hatehets were useless,
occasioned by cutting the hard timber that grew on the
island. It took me up a full week to make my grindstone
of use to me; and at last I found out a way to turn it about
with my foot, by help of a wheel and a string.

leril 30. My bread falling short, I allowed myself but
one biscuit a day.

May 1. As I walked along the seashore I found a bar-
rel of gunpowder, and several pieces of the wreck which
the sea had flung up. Having secured these, I made to
the ship, whose stern was torn ofl', and washed a great
distance ashore; but the rest lay it. the sands This, I
suppose, was occasioned by the earthquake. I now re-
solved to keep my old place of abode: and also to get to
the ship that day, but found it impossible.

May 3. This dayI went on board, and with my saw
sawed ofl' one of the beams, which kept her quarter-deck.
I then cleared the sand till flood.

May 4. I caught some fish, but they were not whole-
some. The same day, I also caught a young dolphin.

May 5. This day also I repaired to the wreck, and
sawed another piece of timber; and when the flood came,
I made a float of three great planks, which were driven
ashore by the tide.

May 6--9. These days, I brought off the iron bolts,
opened the deck with the iron crow, and carried two planks
to land, having made a way into the very' middle of the
wreck.

May 10--13. All this time I spent in bringing ofi'great
quantities of iron and timber.

May 15. Took with me two hatchets on purpose to cut
off some lead from the roll but all in vain, for it lay too low
under water.

May 24. To this day, I worked on the wreck, and with
great difficulty loosened some things so much with the crow,
that at the first blowing tide, several casks floated out, and
several of the seamen s chests; yet that day nothing came
to land but pieces of timber, and a hogshead which had
some pork in it. I continued working to the 15th of June;
(except necessary times for food and rest,) and had I known
how to build a boat, I had timber and planks enough; I
had also near 100 weight of sheet lead. .

June 16. As I was wandering towards the seaside, I
found a large tortoise or turtle, being the first I had seen

on the island, though, as I afterwards found, there were
many on the other side of it____________.--__._----------------------1

38 LIFE AND ADVENTURES or

June 1'7. This day I spent in cooking it, found in her
threescore eggs, and her flesh the most savory and pleasant
I ever tasted in my life.

June l8. 1 staid within this day, there being acontinual
rain; and it was somewhat more chilly and cold than usual.

June 19. Exceedingly ill, taken with a trembling and
shivering.

June 220. Awake all night, my head racked with pain,
and feverish.

June 2]. Sick unto death, and terrified with dismal ap-
prehensions of my condition. Prayed to God more fre-
quently, but very confusedly.

June '22. Something better, but still uneasy in my mind.

June 23. Again relapsed much as before.

June 2-1. Mended a second time.

June '25. A violent ague for seven hours, cold and hot
fits, succeeded with faint sweats.

June 26. Better, but very weak; yet I scrambled out,
shot a she goat, brought it home, and broiled some of it; I
would willingly have stewed it and made some broth, but
had no pot.

June '27. All this day I was afflicted with an ague;
thirsty, yet could not help myself to water; prayed to God
in these words: " Lord; in pity look upon me: Lord, have
mercy upon me, have mercy upon me! " After this I fell
asleep, which, when I awnkcd, I found had much refreshed
me.

I rose up, in a pensive manner, being so thoughtful that
I could no: go to sleep: and fearing the dreadful return of
my distemper, it caused me to remember, that the Brazil-
ians use tobacco for almost all diseases. I then went to
my chest, in order to find some, where heaven, no doubt,
directed me to find a cure, both for soul and body; for
there I found one of the bibles, which, till this time, I had
neither leisure nor inclination to look into; I took both the
tobacco and that out of my chest, and laid them on the
table. Several experiments did I try with the tobacco.
First, I took a piece of leaf, and chewed it; but it being
very green and strong, almost stupiticd me: next I steeped
it in some rum an hour or two, resolving when I went to
bed, to take a dose of it: and, in the third place, 1 burnt
some over a pan of tire, holding my nose over it so long as
I could endure it without suffocation.

In the intervals of this operation, though my head was
giddy and disturbed by the tobacco, I took up the Bible to
rend. No sooner did I open, but there appeared to me
these words, " Call on me in the day oftrouble and I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."

At first, this sentence made a very deep impression on
my heart: but it soon were of? main when I considered
the word " deliver " was foreign to me. And as the child-
ren of Israel said, when they were promised flesh to eat,
" Can God spread a table in the wilderness? " in the like
.nnnner I began to sny, Can God himself deliver me from
this desolate Island? However, the words would still return
to my mind, and afterwards made ngreater impression upon
me. As it now was very late, and the tobacco had dnzed
my head, Iwas inclined to sleep; but before I would lie
down, I fell on my knees, and implored the promise that
God had made to me in the holy Scriptures, that "if
I called on him in the day of trouble, he would deliver
me."

With much difficulty I afterwards drank the rum, where-
in I had steeped the tobacco, which flying into my head,
threw me into such a profound sleep, that it was three
o'clock the next day before I awoke; or rather I believe,
I sle t two days, having certainly lost a day in my account,
and rcould never tell any other way.

I'Vhen I got up, my spirits were lively and cheerful; my
stomach much better, being very hungry; and, in short no
fit returned the next day, which was the 29th, but I found
myself much altered for the better.

July 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak. In this
condition, I often thought of these words, " I will deliver
thee: " and while at sometimes 1 would think of the impos-
sibility of it, other thoughts would reprehcnu me, for dis-
regarding the deliverances I had received even from the
most forlorn and distressed condition. I asked myself,
what regard have I had to God for his abundant mercresr
Have I done my part? " He has delivered me, but I have
not glorified him; " us if I had said I had not owned and
been thankful for these as deliverauccs, and 'now could I
expect greater? So much did this sensibly touch my heart,
that I gave God thanks for my recovery from sickness in
the most humble posture.

July 4. This mornina I began seriously to ponder on
what is written in the IVew 'Iestnment, resolving to rend
i a chapter every morning and night, as long as my thoughts
; would engage me.

As soon as I set about this work seriously, I found my
heart deeply affected with the impiety of my past life.
After this, I begged of God to assist me with his holy
Spirit in returning to my duty. One day, in perusing the
Scriptures, I came to these words, " He is exalted a.
Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance, and to give
remission: " Immediately I laid down the book, and, with
uplifted hands to heaven, loudly cried, " O blessed Jesus,
thou son of David! Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Sav-
iour, give me repentance: " And, now indeed, I prayed
with a true sense of my condition, and a more certain hope,
founded on the word of God. N ow I had a different sense
of these words, "Call on me, and I will deliver thee,"
that is from the dreadful load of guilt, which oppressed my
sinful soul, and not from a solitary life: in a word, I came
to this conclusion, that a deliverance from sin was a much
greater blessing than a deliverance from affliction.

To the 14th of July, I walked about with my gun, little
and little at a time, having been reduced to the greatest ex-
tremity of weakness. The applications and experiments I
used were perfectly new: neither could I recommend them
to any one's practice. For though it carried off the fit, it
very much weakened me; and I had frequently convulsions
in my nerves and limbs for some time. From hence I
learned, that going abroad in rainy weather, especially
when it was attended with storms and hurricanes of wind
was most pernicious to health. I had now been above ten
months in the island; and as I never had seen any of the
human kind, I therefore accounted myself as sole monarch;
and as I grew better, having secured my habitation to my
mind, I resolved to make a tour round my kingdom, in
order to make new discoveries.

The 15th of Jul , I began my journey. I first went to
the creek, where had brought my rafts on shore: and
travelling farther found the tide went no higher than two
miles up, where there was a little brook of running water,
on the bank of which were many pleasant savannas or
meadows, smooth, plain and covered with grass. 0n the
rising parts, where I supposed the water did not reach, I
perceived a great deal of tobacco growing to a very strong
stalk. Several other plants I likewise found, the virtue

" which I did not understand. I searched a long time for
the cassava root, which I knew the Indians in that climate
made their bread of; but all in vain. There were several
plants of" aloes, though at that time I knew not what they
were: likewise I saw several sugar--canes, but imperfect
for want of cultivation. With these few discoveries, I came
hack that night, and slept eontentedly in my little castle.

The next day, being the 16th, going the same way, bu
farther than the day before, 1 found the country more
adorned with woods and trees. Here I perceived diti'erent
fruits in great abundance. Melons in plenty lay on the
ground, and clusters of grapes, ripe and very rich, spread
over the trees. You may imagine I was glad of this dis--
covery, yet ate very sparingly, lest I should throw thyself
into a flux or fever. The grapes I found of excellent use;
for when I dried them in the sun, which-preserved them
as dried raisins are kept, they proved very wholesome and
nourishing, and served me in those seasons when no grapes
were to be had.

The night drawing on apaee, I ascended up a tree, and
slept very comfortably, though it was the first time I had
slept out of my habitation. And when the morning came,
I proceeded with great pleasure on my way, travelling
about four miles, as I imagined, by the length of the val-
ley. At the end ofthis valley I came to an opening, where
the country seemed to descend to the west; there I found
a spring of fresh water, proceeding out of the side of the
hill. with its crystal streams running directly east. And
indeed here my senses were charmed with the most beauti-
ful landscape nature could afford; for the country appeared
so flourishing. green and delightful, that to me it seemed
like a planted garden. I then descended on the side of
that delicious vale, when I found abundance of cocoa,
orange, lemon, and citron trees, but very wild and barren
at that time. As for the limes, they were delightful andmnixson cnvsoa. 43

wholesome, the juice of which I afterwards used to mix in
water, which made it very cool and refreshing. And now
: I was resolved to carry home and lay up a store of grapes, '
limes and lemons, against the approaching wet season. So
laying them up in separate parcels, and then taking a few 2
of each with me, I returned to my little castle, after having
spent three days in this journey. Before I got home, the
grapes were so bruised that they were utterly spoiled; the
limes indeed were good, but of those, I could bring only a
few. -

July 19. Having prepared two bags, I returned thither
again, but to my great surprise, found all the grapes spread
about, trod to pieces, and abundance eaten, which made
me conclude there were wild beasts thercabouts. To pre-
vent this happening again, I gathered a large quantity of
the grapes, and hung them upon the out branches of the
tree, both to keep them unhurt, and that they might cure
and dry in the sun; and having well loaded myself with
limes and lemons, I returned once more to my old place of
residence.

And now, reflecting on the fruitfulness of this valley,
the pleasantness of its situation, its security from storms,
' and the delightfulness of the adjacent woods, I concluded I
" was settled in the worst part of the country, and therefore
was thinking to remove my habitation.

But when I considered again, that though it was plea-
sant, it was off from the sea--side, where there was a possi-
bility, some time or other, a ship might either be driven or
sail by; and that to enclose myself among hills and woods
must certainly put an end to my hopes of deliverance; I re-
solved to let my castle remain where Providence had first

laced it. Yet, so delighted was I with this place, that

made me a little kind of bower, surrounding it with a

L________J
double hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked and
tilled with bulrnshes: and having spent a great part of the
month of July, I think it was the first of August before
began to enjoy my labor.

alugusl :3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry, Itonk them
from the trees, and they proved excellent good raisins ot'
the sun: the most of which I carried to my cave: and hap-
py tor me 1 did so, by which 1 saved the best part of my
winter food.

.mlgusl H. This day it began to rain; and thoughl
had made. me a tent like the other, yet having no shelter
nt'a hill to keep me. from storms, nor a cave behind me to
retreat to, I was obliged to return to my old ~aslle, the rain
continued more or less every day. till the middle of Octo-
ber; and sometimes so violently. that 1 could not stir out
ot'my cave for several days. This season 1 found my fam-
ily to increase; tbr one of my cats that had ran away from
me, and which I thought had been dead, returned about
August, with three kittens at her heels, like herself; from
these eats proceeded sueh nmnbers, that l was forced to
kill and destroy them as I would do wild beasts or vernnn

To the QGth ol'tliis month, I could not stir out. it raining
incessantly; when beginning to want food, I was compelled
to venture twice. the first ol'whieh times I shot a goat, uml
afterwards found a very large tortoise. The manner of
regulating my timd was thus; a bunch of raisins served me
for my breakfast; a piece ofgont's flesh or turtle boiled for
my dinner, and two or three turtle eggs for my supper.
While the rain lasted. 1 daily worked two or three hours at
enlarging my cave, and, by degrees worked it on towards
one side of the hill, and made a door or way out, which
came beyond my fence or wall, and so 1 came in and out
this way But otter I had done this. I was troubled to see*'M

myself thus exposed; though I could not perceive any thing
to fear, a goat being the biggest creature I had seen upon
this island.

September 30. Cnstin up the notches on my post, they
amounted to 365, I conc uded this to be the anniversary
of my landing; and therefore, humbly prostrating m self
on the ground confessing my sins, acknowledging ad's
righteous judgments upon me, and praying to Jesus Christ
to have mercy upon me, I fasted for twelve hours till the
going down of the sun; and then eating a biscuit and a
bunch of grapes, laid me on a bed, and with rest comfort
took my night's repose. Till this time, I sel om had dis-
tinguished the Sabbath-day; but now I made a longer
notch than ordinary for the days of rest, and divided the
weeks as well asl could, though I found I had lost a day
or two in my account. My ink failing soon after, I omitted
in my daily memorandum, thin s of an indifferent nature,
and contented myself to write own on] the most remark-
able events of my life. The rainy and ry seasons appear-
ed now regular to me, and experience taught me how to
provide for them; yet in one thing I am going to relate,
my experience very much failed me. You may call to
mind, what I have mentioned of some barley and rice which
I had saved; about thirty stalks of the former, and twenty
of the latter; and, at that time, the sun's being in its south-
ern position, going from me, together with the rains, made
me conclude it a very pr0per season to sow it. Accordingly
I dug up a piece of ground, with my wooden 3 ads, and
dividing it in two parts, sowed about two thirds o myseed,
preserving by me a handful of each. And happy it was I
did so; for no rains falling, it was choked up, and never
appeared above the earth till the wet season came again,
and then part of it grew, as if it had been newly sown.l--------_--']

\.~U ring the wet months, sot within doors as much as possible.
it this time I contrived to make many handy things that I
ranted, though it cost me much labor and pains, before I
:ould :meotnplish them The first I tried was to make a
msket; but all the twigs I could get, proved so brittle, that

could not then perform it. It now proved ofgreat use to
no, that when a boy, I took great delight in standing at a
musket maker's, in the same town where my father lived,
'0 view his men at work: like other boys, being curious to
nee the manner of their working these things, and very
odieious to assist, I perfectly learned the method of it, and
wanted nothing but the tools. And it coming into my mind,
hat the twigsot'tlmt tree at which I made my stakes, might
be as tough as a snllow, willow, or osiers growing in Eng-
ond, I resolved to make an experiment, and went the next
any to my country seat, and found some fit for my turn;
and ttlit'l' cutting down a quantity with my hatchet, I dried
them in my pale, and when fit to work with, carried them
to my cave, where I employed myself in making several
sorts of baskets, insomuch that I could put in whatsoever
I pleased. It is true, they were not cleverly made, yet
they served my turn upon all occasions.

But still I wanted two necessary things. I had no cask
to hold my liquor, except two almost full of rum, at'ew
bottles of on ordinary size, and some square case bottles;
neither had I a pot to boil any thing in, only a large kettle,
unfit to make broth, or stew 11 hit of meat: I wanted like-
wise at the beginning of this dry season a tobacco-pipe;
but for this I afterwards found on expedient.

I kept myself employed in planting my second row of
stakes. But remembering that when I travelled up to the
brook I had a mind to see the whole island, I now resumed
my intention, and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two bis-
 
  

cuit cakes, a great bunch of raisins, with a larger quantity
of powder and shot than usual, I began my journey. Hav-
ing passed the vale. where my bower stood, I came. within
view of the sea lying to the west; when, it being a clear
day. l fairly deacried land, extending from the west to the
southwest about It) or I?) leagues, as I concluded; but
could not say whether it. was an island or a continent.
Neither could I tell what this place might be; only thought I
, u was part of America, and where. I might have been in
i; a miserable condition had l landed. Again I considered,
! . that if this was the Spanish coast, certainly, one time or
1 the other, I should see. some. ships pass by; and il' it was
' not, then it must he the savage coast, between the Spanish
country and Brazil, which abounds with cannibals or man
eaters.

As I proceeded forward. I found this side of the island
much more, pleasant. than mine; the fields fragrant, adorned
with sweet flowers and verdant. g ass, together with several
' very line. woods. There. were parrots in plenty which made
me long for one to be my companion; but it was with great.
ditlieulty I could knock one down with my stick; and I kept
him at home some years, before I could get him to call me
by name.

In the. low grounds I found various sorts of hares and
= foxes as I took them to be, but much difl'erent from those
in England. Several ofthese I killed, but never ate them;
l' neither indeed had 1 any occasion; for abounding with
goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes, I could defy any mar-
ket to furnish me a better table. In this journey I did not
t travel above two miles a day, because Itook several turns
and windings, to see what discoveries I could make, re-
turning weary enough to the place where I designed to
rest all night, which was either in a tree, or to a place
which I surrounded with stakes, that no wild creature
might suddenly sur rise me. When I came to the sea-
shore, I was amaze to see the splendor of it. Its strand
was covered with shells of the most beautiful fish, and
constantly aboundin with innumerable turtles, and fowls

of many kinds, whic I was i norant of, except those call-
' ed penguins. I might have 3 0t as many as l pleased, but

was sparing of my ammunition, rather choosing to kill a.
she- out, which I did with much difliculty, on account of
the Eatness of the country.

Now, though this journey produced the most pleasing
satisfaction, yet my habitation was so much to my liking,
that I did not repine at my being seated on the worst part
of the island. I continued my journey, travelling about
twelve miles further towards the east, where I set a great
pile on the shore for a mark, concluding that my next
journey should bring me to.the other side of the island,
cast from m castle, and so round till I came to my post
again. As had a constant view of the country, I thought
[could not miss my way; but scarce had I travelled three
miles, when Idescended into a ver large valley, so sur-
rounded with hills covered with Won , that havingr no guide
but the sun, and to add to my misfortune, the weather: prov-
ing very hazy, I was obliged to return to my post by the
seaside, and so backwards the same way I came. In this
journey my dog surprised a kid, and would have killed it
had I not prevented him. As I had often been thinking of
getting a kid or two, and so raising a breed of tame goats
to supply me after my ammunition was spent, I took this
opportunity of beginning: and, having made a collar for
this little creature, with a string made of ro -yern, I
brought it to my bower, and there enclosed an left him;
and having spent a month in this journey, at length I re-
turned to my old habitation.

the islai1d.[ spent the 11 hole day In acknowledging Gnd' s
mercies, in gi1ing thanks for making this solitaryi5 life as

Pro1idence, and hope for his eternal presence in the world

think of the w,oods the mountains, the deserts I was in;
and how I "as a prisoner locked up within the eternal bars
and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, with-
out h0pes, and without redemption. In this condition, I
would often wring my hands, and weep like achild: and
even sometimes in the middle of my work, this fit would
often take me; and then I would sit down and sigh, lookingaoarxsorl censoe. 51

on the ground for an hour or two together, till such time l
as my grief got vent in a flood of tears.

One morning, as I was fully emplo 'ed in this manner I
opened my Bible, when immediately fixed my eyes upon
these words, " I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee!" '
Surely, if God does not forsake me, what matters it, since
he can make me more happy in this state of life, than if I
enjoyed the greatest splendor in the world? And whenever
I opened or shut the Bible, I blessed kind Providence, i
that directed my good friend in England to send it among
my goods without my order, and for assisting me to save it
from the power of the raging ocean.

And now beginning my third year, my several daily em-- 1
ployrnents were these: First, My duty to Heaven, and dili- l
gently reading the Holy Scriptures which I did twice or
thrice every day; Secondlt, Seeking provisions with my
gun, which commonly took me up, when it did not rain,
three hours every morning; Wtirdly, The ordering,curing,
preserving, and cooking what I had killed, or catched for
my supply, which took me up a great part of the day; for
in the middle of the day, the sun being in its height, it
was so hot, that I could not stir out; so that I had but four
hours in the evening to work in: and then the want of tools,
of assistance, and skill, wasted a great deal of time to little
purpose. I was no less than two and forty days, making a.
board fit for a long shelf which two sawyers, with their
- tools and saw-pit, would have cut out of the same tree in
! half a day. It was of a large tree, as my board was to be
' broad. I was three days in cutting it down, and two more >>
in loppin off the boughs, and reducing it to a piece of x
timber. usI hacked and hewed off each side, till it be-
came light to move; then I turned it, made one side of it
, smooth and flat as a board from end to end then turned it
downward, cuttinIr the. other side, till I brought the plank
to be about three inches IlIiI k, IiIIIl smooth on both sides.

piece III onk', but this I "out tlIrouIrlI \IitlI patience, (Is

also many other mines, that. my cireuIn:tIuIceI-I IIIIIde neces-
sary for me to do.

The harvest IIIontlIs, November and December, were
now at hand, in whieh I had the pleasing prospect ol' a very
good crop. But here I met with II new IIIiinIrtune, IN the

hands, instead ()l thrIIslIinIr it; IIIIIl when my harvest was
over, l'ound my hnlt peck ot seed had produced nearly two
bushels III nee, and two bushels and II half of burlev. And
now I plainly foresaw. that. by God's goodness, I should

 

 

x"
be fiirnished with bread: but yet I was concerned, because
I knew not how to grind or make meal of my corn, neither
knew I how to bake it into bread. I would not, however,
taste any of the crop, but resolved to preserve it against
next season, and, in the meanwhile, use my best endeav-
ors to provide myself with other food.

But where were my labors to end? the want of a plough
to turn up the earth,~or shovel to dig it, I conquered by
making me a wooden spade. The want of a harrow I sup-

lied, by dragging over the corn a great bough of a tree
hen it was growing, I was forced to fence it: when ripe,
to mow it, carry it home, thresh it, part it from the chafl
and save it. And, after all, I wanted a mill to grind it, a
sieve to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and
an oven to bake it. This set my brains to work, to find
some expedient for every one of these necessaries, against
the next harvest.

And now having more seed, my first care was to pre-
pare me more land. I pitched upon two large flat pieces of
ground, near my castle, for that purpose, in which I sowed
my seed, and fenced it with a good hedge. This took me
up three months: by which time, the wet season coming
on, and the rain keeping me within doors, I found several
occasions to employ myself; and, while at work, used to
divert myself with talking to my parrot, teaching him to
know and speak his own name Poll, the first welcome word
I ever heard spoken in the island. I had been a long time
contriving how to make earthen vessels, which I wanted
extremely; and when I considered the heat of the climate,
I did not doubt but, if I could find any such clay, I might
batch up a pot, strong enough, when dried in the sun, to
bear handlin , and to hold any thing that was dry, as corn,
meal. and 0 or things.. :'l' fi

I Iound I IIIIII three vurv good pipkins. and mo earthen
pots, as well burnt and fit for my turn as I could desire.
The first use to which I turned my pi )kins was to make
some salt, which 1 had long wanted. her this purpose, I
tilled them with sen-water, and kept it slowly boiling over
the tire, till the whole of the water had boiled away in
steam, leaving, at the bottom of the vessel, a thin crust of
salt, which I (hand very good (hr giving a relish to my food.

The next concern I had, was to get me n stone-mortar
to beat some corn in, instead of a mill to grind it. Here,
indeed, I was at a great loss, as not being lit for a stone-
cutter; and many days I spent to find out a great stone big
enough to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar and strong
enough to bear the weight ot'a pestle, that would break the
corn without filling it with sand. But all the stones of the
island being or a mouldering nature, rendered my search
li'uitless; and then I resolved to look out a great block of
hard wood; which having found, I formed it by my axe and
hummer, and then, with infinite labor, made a hollow in it,
just as the Indians of Brazil make their canoes. When I
had finished this I made a great pestle of iron-wood, and
then laid them up against my succeeding harvest.

My next business was to make me a sieve, to sift my
meal and part it from the bran and husk. Having no fine
thin canvass to search the meal through, I could not tell
what to do. What linen I had was reduced to rags; I had
root's hair enough, but neither tools to work it, nor did I

now how to spin it. At len th, I remembered I had some
neckcloths ol' calico or muslin of the sailors, which I had
brought out of the ship, and with these, I made three small
sieves proper enough for the work.

I come now to consider the baking part. The want of
an oven I sup lied, b making some earthen pans very
broad, but not eep. hen I had a mind to bake, I made
a great fire upon my hearth, the tiles of which I had made06 1.an AND anvm'ruans or

myself, and when the wood was burnt into lire coals, I
spread them over it. till it became very hot; then sweeping
them away, I set down my leaves, and whelming down the
earthen pots upon themI drew the ashes. and coals all around
the outsidex ot' the pots to continue. the. beat; and in this
manner 1 baked my barley loaves, as well as il' l had been
a eomplete pastry cook, and also made ol' the rice, several
cakes and puddings.

It is no wonder that all these. things took me up the bth
part ofa year. sinee what intermediate time I had, was be,-
stowed in [managing my new harvest and husbandry; For in
the proper season, I reaped 1in corn, carried it home and
laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets. till I had time to
rub, instead of thrashing it. And new indeed, my corn in-
creased so much, that it produced me twenty bushels of
uarley, and as much of riee, that I not only bega 'to use it
freely, but was thinking how to enlarge my barns, and re-
5olved to saw as much at a time as would be sutlieient for
a whole year.

All this while. the prospect of land, which I had seen
from the. other side of the island, ran in my mind. I still
meditated a deliverance from this place, though the fear of
greater mistbrtunes might have deterred me. from it. For
allowing that 1 had attained that place, I ran the hazard of
being killed and eaten by the devouring cannibuls; and if
they were not so yet I might be slain, as other Europeans
had been, who fell into their hands. Notwithstanding all
this,'my thoughts ran continually upon that shore. I now
wished for the long boat with the shoulder of mutton sail.
I went to the ship's boat, that had been cast a great way on
the shore in the late storm. She was removed but a little;
and her bottom being turned up by the impctuosity and
surge of the waves and wind, I fell to work with all the
strength I had, and with levers and rollers I had cut from
the wood, to turn her, and repair the damages she had sus-
tuincd. This wurk took me up three or four weeks, when
finding my little strength all in vain, I fell to undermining
it by digging away the sand, and so to make it fall down,
setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it in the fall.
But after this was done, I was still unable to stir it up, or
to get under it, much less to move it forward towards the
water, and so I was forced to give it over.

This disappointment, however, did not frighten me. I
began to think, whether it was not possible for me to make
a canoe or l'crigua, such as the Indians make of the trunk
of a tree. But-here I lay under particular inconveniences;
want of tools to make it, and want of hands to move it into
the water, when it was made. However, to work I went
upon it, stopping all the inquiries I could make with this
very simple answer I made to myself, let's first make it,
I'll warrant I'll find some way or other to get it along when
it is done.

1 first cut down a cedar tree, which was five feet ten
inches diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four
feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet,
after which it lessened for a space, and then parted into
branches. Twenty days was I hacking and hewing it at
the bottom, fourteen more in cutting otl' the branches and
limbs, and a whole month in shaping it like the bottom of
a boat. As for the inside, I was three weeks with a mallet
and chisel, clearing it in such a manner, as that it was bi
enough to can 26 men, much bi ger than any canoe
ever saw in my it'e, and conse uent y suflieient to transport
me and all my effects to that Wished for shore I so ardently
desired.

my com: in a word, the nature and experience of these
things dictated to me this just reflection. That the good
things of this world are no further good to us than as they
are for our use; and that whntevcr we may heap up, we
can but enjoy as much as we use and no more.

These thoughts rendered my mind more easy than usual:
every time I sat down to meat, I did eat with thankfnlness,
udmirin the providentinl hand of God, who, in this wilder-
ncss hndxsprend a table to me. And now I considered what
I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted, compared my pre-
sent condition with what I at first expected it should be;
how I should have done, if I had got nothing out of the ship;
that I must have perished before I had caught fish or tur-
tles; or lived, had I found them, like a mere savage, by
outing them raw, and pulling them to pieces with my claws,
like a beast. 1 next com iared my station to that which I
deserved; how undutiful had been to my parents; how
destitute of the fear of God; how void of every thing that
was wood; and how ungrateful for those abundant mercies
I ha received from heaven, being fed, as it were by a mir-
nclc, even as great as Elijah's being fed by ravens; and
cost on it place where there are no venomous creatures to
poison or devour mo; in short, making God's tender mer-
cies matter ofgrent consolation, I relinquished all sadness,
and gave way to contentment.

As long as my ink continued, which with water I made
last as long as I could, I used to minute down the days
of the month on which any remarkable thing happened.

The next thing that wasted after my ink, was the biscuit,
which I had brought out of the ship; and though I allowed
myself but one cake a day for about a twelvemonth, yet I
was quite out of bread for nearly a year, before I got any
corn of my own.

In the next place, my clothes began to decay, and my
linvu hnd lwc-n gum: long before. llowovor, I had preserv-
ed about throv duzvu ol'tho suilors' chvolu-rcd shirts which
provvd u grout rcti'oshuwut to me, whvn tho \'iolvut humus
ol'tho suu would not sutli-r luv to [war any of tho sonmuns'

st-tllod in my mind. my chivl'hnppiuvss was to converse. with
God. in most houvt-uly nud umnliu-tuhlc ojuculutions.

For live _y wurs ul'tvr this, I vunnot suy any uxtruordinur)r
thing ocmu'rt-d to mo. My chivt'c-mployun'ut was to cure
my ruisius. und pluut, my hurlvy uud rico, of both which I
had a year's provision holorv-lmml. But though I was dis-
appointed in my tirst cunov, I mudt- it. at. illlcl'llu'tliulc tiun-s,
my business to undue u svuond ot' much iul'orior size: und it
wustwo yours lwl'orv I had tinislu-d it. But as I purovivod it
would in uowiso answer my dosigu ol' sailing to tho otln'r
shorv, my thoughts won- ('ontim'd to lake It tour rouml tho
isluud,to sue whut l'urthor discoveries I could make. To this
intent, utter having mow-d her to the water, und tried how
shu would sail, l tittt-d up it little must to In boot, and
made it suil ol'thc ship's suils tlmt lny by me. then made
lockers or boxes at the end of it to put in no. ossnrics, pro-
vision nnd mnmunitioln which would preserve them dry
either from the rain, or the spray of tho sou; and, in the
inside ot'the bout, I cut mo a long hollow pluco to luy my
fun, and to keep it dry, made it cover for it. My umbrella,

fixed in a step in the stern, like a must, to keep the heat.
of the sun ofi' me. And now resolving to see the circum
fcrence of my little kin vdom, I victuullcd my ship for the
voyage, puttinfi in two (linen of my barley bread loaves, an
earthen pot l'ul of arched rice, a little bottle of rum, half
a goat, powder on shot, and two watch-coats. It was the
sixth of November, in the sixth year of my reign, or cap-
tivity, that I set out on this voyage; which was much
longer than I expected, being obliged to put further out,
by reason of the rocks that lay a great way in the sea.

And indeed, so much did these rocks surprise me, that I
was for putting back, fearing that if I ventured farther, it
would be out of my power to return: in this uncertainty I
came to anchor just off the shore, to which I waded with
my gun on my shoulder, and then climbing up a hill, which
overlooked that point, I saw the full extent of it, and so
resolved to run all hazards.

In this prospect from the hill, I perceived a. violent
current running to the cast, coming very close to the point;
which I the more carefully observed, thinking it dangerous,
and that when I came to it, I might be driven into the sea
by its force, and not able to return to the island: and oer-
tuinly it must have been so, had I not made this observa-
tion; for on the other side was a like current, with this
difference, that it set off at a greater distance; and I
perceived there was a strong eddy under the land; so that
my chief business was to work out of the first current,
and conveniently get into the eddy. Two days I staid here,
the wind blowing vcry briskly east southeast, which being
contrary to the current, leaves a great breach of the sea
upon the point; so it was neither fit for me to keep too
near the shore, on account of the breach; nor stand at
too great distance for fear of the streams. That night
the wind abating, it grew so calm, that I ventured out: and
llL'I'O I may he a monument to all rash and ignorant pilots:
tin' l was no sooner come to the point, and not above the
boat's length from shorv, but I was got into dL'I'p water,
IIiIh a unrrcut like It IIIill-rauu, which drove my boat along
so I'iol1-ntly, that. it was impossible for me to keep near the
edge of ll, for it tln'cod me more and more out li'onI the
eddy to the lcl'l ol'nic; and all I could do with my paddles
was usL css, than: being no wind to help me.

Now I hogan to look upon mysvll' as quite lost, Sillt't', as
the t'lll'I'Clll ran on both sidI-s I-I'thI- island, I was very certain

the island, it once it had IlisappuaII-d; but it proving the
contrar) , I set up mv mast IIII Iiin, spread my sail and stood
away northward, as much as 1 could, to get rid of the
 

current. And no sooner did the boat begin to stretch away,
but I perceived by the clearness of the water, a change of
the current was near; for, where it was strong, the water
was foul; and where it was clear the current abated.

Those who have been in the like calamities with m
own, may guess my present excess of joy, how heartily
ran my boat in the stream of this eddy, and how joyfully I
spread my sail to the refreshing wind, standing cheerfully
before it, with a smart tide under foot. By the assistance
of this eddy, I was carried above a league home again,
when, being in the wake of the island, betwixt the two
currents, I found the water to be in a sort of a stand.
About four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached within a
league of the island, and perceived the points of the rock,
which caused this disaster, stretching out, as I observed
before, to the southward, which throwing off the current
more southerly, had occasioned another eddy to the north.
But having a fair brisk gale, l stretched across this eddy,
and in an hour came within a mile of the shore, where
I soon landed to my unspeakable comfort; and after an
humble prostration, thanking God for my deliverance, with
a resolution to lay all thoughts of escaping aside, I brought
my boat safe to a little cove, and laid me down to take a
welcome repose. When I awoke, I was considering how I
might get my boat home; and coasting along the shore 1
came to a good bay, which ran up to a rivulet or brook,
where, finding a harbor, I stowed her as safe as if she had
been in a dry dock, made on purpose for her.

I now perceived myself not far from the place, where
before I had travelled on foot: so taking nothing with me,
except my gun and umbrella, I began my 'ourney, and in
the evening came to my bower, where again laid the
down to rest. I had not slept long before I awakened inIi'l LIFE AND AIH'I'IN'I'IIIUIZS OF

III SI
tion. As to mechanic labors, which my necessities obliged
me to, I fancied I could, upon occasion, make a tolerable
carpenter, were- the poor tools I had to work withal, but
good. Besides, as I improved in my earthen ware, I eon-
trived to make them with a wheel, which I found much
easier and better, making my work shapely, which before
was rude and ugly. But, I think I never was so much
elevated with my own performance or project as when able
to make a tobacco-pipe, which, though it proved an awk
ward clumsy thing, yet it was very sound, and carried the
smoke perfectly we] , to my great satisfaction.

I also improved my wicker ware, made me abundance
of necessary baskets, which, though not very handsonn,
were ver handy and convenient to fetch things borne in,
as also or holding my stores, barley, rice, and other pro-
visions.

My powder be inning to fail, made me examine after
what manner I s ould kill the goats or birds, to live on,
after it was all gone. Upon which I contrived many ways
to ensnare the cats, and see if I could catch them alive,
particular] a s e-goat with young.

At last had my desire; for, making pit-falls and traps,
baited with barley and rice, I found, one morni , in one
of them, an old he oat, and in the other, three ids, one
male, and two fem es.

So boisterous was the old one, that I could not bring him
away. But I for at the old proverb, "That h erwill
tame a lion:" for, ad I lie him threeor four da s without

rovisions, and then given 'm somewater with a ittlecorn,
e would have been as tame as a young kid. The other
creatures I bound with strings together; but I had great
difliculty, before I could bring them to my habitation. It
was some time before they would food; but. throwing them66 Lira AND "van-runes or

 

sweet corn, it so much tempted them, that they began to
be tamer. From hence I concluded, that if I designed to
furnish myself with goat's flesh, when my ammunition was
spent, the tamely breeding them up, like a flock of shee
about my settlement, was the only method I could take.
concluded also that I must separate the wild from the tame,
or else they would always run wild as they grew up; and
the best way for this, was to have some enclosed piece of
ground, well fenced, either with a hedge or pale, to keep
them so efl'ectually, that those within might not break out,
nor those without break in. Such an undertaking was
very great for one pair of hands; but as there was an ab-
solute necessity for doing it, my first care was to find a
convenient piece of ground, where there was likely to be
herbage for them to eat, water to drink, and cover to keep
them from, the sun.

Here again, I gave another instance of my ignorance
and inexperience, pitchin upon a piece of meadow land so
large, that had I enclose it, the hedge or pale must have
been at least two miles about. This thought came into my
head, after I had carried it on, I believe, about fifty yards:
I therefore altered my scheme, and resolved to enclose a
piece of ground about 150 yards in length, and IOO in
breadth, large enough for as many as would maintain me,
till such time as my flock increased, and then I could add
more ground. I now vigorously prosecuted my work, and
it took me about three months in hedging the first piece;
in which time I tethered the three kids in the best part of it;
feeding them as near me as possible, to make them fami-
liar: and, indeed, I very often would carry some ears of
barle , or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand;
by w ich they rew so tame. that when my enclosure was
finished, and I ad let them loose, they would run after me
for a handful of corn. This indeed answered in end:
and in a year and a half's time, I had a flock 0 about
twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years after, they
amounted to forty-three, besides what had taken and
killed for my sustenance.

After which, I enclosed five several pieces of ground to
feed them in, with pens to drive them into, that I might
take them as I had occasion.

In this project I likewise found additional blessings; for
I not only had lenty of goat's flesh, but milk too, which, in
the beginning,I did not so much as think of. And, indeed,
though I had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or
seen butter or cheese made, yet, after some essays and mis.
carriages, I made me both, and never afterward wanted.

How mercifully can the Almighty comfort his creatures,
even in the midst of their reatest calamities? How can
he sweeten the bitterest evi s, and give us reason to mag-
nily him in du eons and risons; what a bounteous table
was here sprea in the wil emess for me, where I expected
nothing at first, but to perish for hunger.

Certainly any one would have smiled to see me at dinner.
There eat my royal majesty, an absolute prince and ruler
of my kingdom, attended by my dutiful subjects, whom if
I pleased, I could either hang, draw, quarter, give them
liberty, or take it away. When I dined, I seemed a king,
eating alone, none daring to presume to do so till I had
done. Poll as if he had been my principal court favorite,
was the only person permitted to talk with me. My old
but faithful dog, now grown exceedingly crazy, continually
sat on my right hand; while my two cats sat on each side
of the table, expecting a bit from my hand, as a principal
mark of my royal favor. These were not the cats I had
orought from the ship; they had been dead long before,68 ml nu) manuals or

and interred near my habitation by mine own hand. But
a couple of their youn I had made tame; the rest ran
wild into the woods, an in time grew so impudent, as to
return and plunder me of my stores, till such time as I shot
a great man , and the rest left me without troubling me
any more. n this plentiful manner did I live, wanting for
nothing but conversation. One thing indeed concerned
me, the want of my boat; I knew not which way to get her
round the island. One time I resolved to go along the
shore by land to her; but had any one at home met such
afigure, it would either have afiiighted him, or made him
burst into laughter; nay, I could not but smile myself at
my habit, which I think in this place will be very proper
to describe.

The cap I wore upon my head, was great, high, and
shapeless, made of a goat's skin, with a flap or penbhouse
hangin down behind, not only to keep the sun from me,
but to s act the rain of from running into my neck, nothing
being more pernicious than the ruin falling upon the lies
in these climates. I had a short jacket of goat's skin, -
whose hair hung down such a length on each side, that it
reached down to the calves of my legs. As for shoes and
stockin s, I had none, but made a resemblance of some-
thing, know not what to call them; they were made like
buskins, and laced on the-sides like spatterdaehes, barba-
rously shaped, like the rest of my habit. I had abroad
belt of goat's skin dried, girt round me with a couple of
then , instead of buckles; on each of which, to supply
the eticiency of sword and dug er, hung my hatchet and
saw. I had another belt, not mined, yet fastened in the
same manner, which hung over my shoulder, and at the
and of'it, under my lettarm, hung two pouches, made of
goat's skin, to hold my powder and shot. My basket I
carried on my back, and my gun on my shoulder; and
over my head a great clumsy ugly goat's skin umbrella,
which however, next to my gun, was the most necessary
thing about me. As for my face, the color was not so
swarthy as the Mulattoes, or as might have been expected
from one who took so little care of it, in a climate within
nine or ten degrees of the line. At one time my beard
grew so long that it hung down above a quarter of a yard;
but as I had both razors and scissors in store, I cut it all
off, and suffered none to grow except a large pair of Ma-
hometan whiskers, the like of which I had seen worn by some
Turks at Sales, not long enough indeed to hang a hat upon,
but of such a monstrous size, as would have amazed any in
En land to have seen.

fiat all this was of no consequence here, there being
none to observe my behavior or habit. And so, without
fear and without control, I proceeded on my journe , the
prosecution of which took me up five or six days. tra-
velled along the sea-shore, directly to the place where I
first brought my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks;
but now having no boat to take care of, 1 went over land,
a nearer way to the same height that I was before upon;
when looking forward to the point of the rock, which lay
out, and which I was forced to double with my boat, I was
amazed to see the sea so smooth and quiet, there being no
rippling motion, nor current, any more than in other places.
And now I was convinced that by observing the e b and
flow of the tide, I might easily bring my boat round the
island again. But whenI began to think of putting it in
practice, the remembrance of the late danger struck mo
with such horror that I took another resolution, though more
laborious; and this was to make a second canoe, and me
have one for one side of the island. and one for the ('"w'.
I had now two plantations in the island; the first my little
fortification, fort, or castle, with many large and spacious
improvements, for by this time I had enlarged the cave
behind me with several little caves, one within another, to
hold my baskets, corn, and straw. The piles with which
I made my wall were grown so lofly and great, as obscured
my habitation. And near this commodious and pleasant
settlement, lay my well cultivated and improved corn fields,
which kindly yielded me their fruit in their proper season.
My second plantation was that near my country seat or
little bower, where my grapes tlourished, and where, hav-
ing planted my sakes, 1 made enclosures for my goats,
so strongly t'ortilied by labor and time, that it was much
stronger than a wall, and, consequently, impossible for
them to break through. As for my bower itself, I kept it
constantly in repair, and cut the trees in such a manner, as
made them grow wild, and form a most delightful shade.
In the centre. of this, stood my tent, thus erected. I had
driven t'our piles in the ground, spreading over it a piece
of the ship's sail, beneath which, I made me a sort of
coach with the skins ol'the creatures I had slain, and other
things; and having laid thereon one of the sailor's blan-
kets, which I had saved from the wreck of the ship, and
covering myself with a great watch-coat, I took up this
place for my country retreat.

Very frequently, from this settlement did I use to visit
my boat, and keep her in very good order. And sometimes
would I venture in her a cast or two from shore, but no
farther. But now I entreat your attention, whilst I pro-
ceed to inform you of a new, but most surprising scene of
life which here befell me.

You may easily suppose, that, after having been here so '
long, nothing could be more amazing than to see a human
creature. One day it happened, that going to my boat,
I saw the print of a man's naked foot on the shore, very
evident on the sand, as the toes, heels, and every part of
it. Had I seen a monster of the most fri htful shape, 1
could not have been more confounded. y willing ears
gave the strictest attention. I cast my eyes around, but
could satisfy neither the one nor the other, I proceeded
alternately to every part of the shore, but with equal efl'ect;
neither could I see any other mark though the sand about
it was as susceptible to take impression as that which was
so plainly stamped. Thus struck with confusion and hor-
ror, I returned to my habitation, frightened at every bush
and tree, taking every thing for men; and possessed with
the wildest idea! That night my eyes never closed. I
formed nothing but the most dismal imaginations. In a
word, all my religious hopes vanished, as though I thought
God would not now protect me by his power, who had
wonderfully preserved me so long.

What various chains of events are there in the life of
man! How changeable are our affections, accordin to
different circumstances! We love today, what we ate
to-morrow; we shun one hour, what we seek the next.
This was evident in me in the most conspicuous manner;
for I, who had so much before lamented my condition, in
being banished from all human kind, was now ready to
eXpire, when I considered that a man had set his foot on
this desolate island. But when I considered my station of
life, decreed by the infinitely wise and good providence of
God, that I ought not to dispute my Creator's sovereignty,
who had an undoubted right to govern and dis use of his
creatures as he thinks convenient; and that his Justice and
. mercy could either punish or deliver me, I say, when I
considered all this, I comfortably found it my duty to trust792 um: AND Anvnxronns or

sincerely in him, pray ardeutly to him, and humbly resign
myselfto his divine will.

One morning, lying on my bed, these words ot'tllc sacred
writings came into my mind, " Call upon me in the day of
trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
Upon this sentence, rising more cheerfully from my bed,
I otl'ered tip my prayers in the most devout manner; and
when I had done, taking up my Bible to read, these words
appeared first in my sight, " Wait on the Lord, and be of
good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart: "'ait, I
say, on the Lord." Such divine comfort (lid this give me,
as to remove all cause of sadness upon that occasion.

Thus, after a world of apprehensions and fears tor three
days and nights, I at last ventured out of my castle, and
milked lily goats, one of which was almost spoiled for want
of it. 1 next (though in great fear,) visited my bower, and
milked my tloeks there also; when growing bolder, I went
down to the shore again, and measuring the print of the
foot to mine, to see perhaps whether I myself had not
occasioned that mark, I found it much superior in large-
ness: and so returned home, absolutely convinced, that
either some men had been ashore, or that the island must
be inhabited; and therefore that! might be surprised be-
fore I was aware.

I now began to think of providing for my security, and
resolved in my mind many ditferem schemes for that pur-
pose. I fii-sl proposed to cut down my enclosures, and
turn my tame cattle wild into the woods, that the enemy
might not find them, and frequent the island in hopes of
killing the same. Secondly, I was for digging up my corn-
fields for the very same reason. And, lastly, I concluded
to demolish my bower, lest, seeing a. place of human con-
trivancc, they might come farther, and find out and attack
me in my castle.
Sleep was an utter stranger to my eyes that night; yet
nature, spent and tired, submitted to a silent re se the
next morning, and then joining reason with fear, cousid
ered, that this delightful and pleasant island might not be
so entirely forsaken as I might think; but that the inhab-
itants from the other shore might sail, either with design or
from necessity, by cross winds; and, if the latter circum-
stance, I had reason to believe they would depart the first
opportunity. However, my fear made me think of a lace
of retreat upon an attack. I now repented that had
made my door to come out beyond my fortification; to
remedy which, I resolved to make me a second one: I fell
to work, therefore, and drove betwixt that double row of
trees, which I planted above twelve years before, several
strong piles, thickening it with pieces of timber and old
cables, and strengthening the foot of it with earth which I
dug out of my cave; I also made me seven holes, wherein
I planted my muskets like cannon, fitting them into frames
resembling carriages. This being finished with indefatiga-
ble industry, for a great way every where, I planted sticks
of osiers like a wood, about twenty thousand of them, leav-
ing a large space between them and my wall, that I might
have room to see an enemy, and that they might not be
sheltered among the young trees, if they offered to approach
the outer wall. And indeed, scarce two years had passed
over my head, when there appeared a lovely shady grove,
and in six it became a thick wood perfectly impassable.
For my safety I left no avenue to go in or out; instead of
which, I set two ladders, one to a part of the rock which
was low, and then broke in, leaving room to place another
ladder upon that; so that when I took those down, it was
impossible for any man to descend without hurti himself;
an if they had, they would still be at the outside of my
outer wall. But while I took all these measures at human
prudence for my own preservation, I was not altogether
unmiudt'ul of other atl'airs. To preserve my stock ot'tamo
goats, that the enemy should not take all at once, I looked
out for the most retired part of the island, which was the
place where I had lost myself before mentioned, and there
finding a clear piece of land, containing three acres, sur-
rounded wilh thick woods, I wrought so hard, that in less
than a month's time, I t'cnccd it so well round, that my
flocks were very well secured in it, and I put therein two
he goats and ten she ones.

All this labor was occasioned purely by fearful apprehen-
sions, on account of seeing the print of a man's foot. And
not contented yet with what I had done, I searched for
another place towards the west part. of the island, where I
might also retain another flock. Then wandering on this
errand more to the west of the island than ever I had yet
done, and casting my eyes towards the sea, methought I
perceived a boat at a great distance; but could not possibly
tell what it was for want of my spy-glass. 1 considered
then, it was no strange thing to see the print of a man's
foot; and concluding them eannibals, blessed God for be-
ing cast on the other side of the island, where none of the
savages, as I thought, ever come. But when I came down
the hill to the shore, which was the south-west point of the
island, Iwas soon confirmed in my opinion: nor can any
one describe my horror and amazement, when I saw the
ground spread with sculls, hands, feet, and bones of human
bodies; and particularly, 1 perceived a space like a circle,
in the midst of which had been a fire, about which I con-

jectured those wretches sat, and unnaturally sacrificed and

devoured their fellow creatures.
The horror and loathsomencss of this dreadful spectacle,
both confounded my senses, and made me discharge from
my stomach in an excessive manner. I then returned
towards my habitation; and in my way thither shedding
floods of tears, and falling down on my bended knees,
gave God thanks for making my nature contrar to those
wretches, and delivering me so long out of their ands.
Though reason and my long residence here had assured
me, that the savages never came up to the thick woody
part of the country, and that I had no reason to be a pre-
aensive of a discovery, yet such an abhorrence did still
retain, that for two years after, I confined myself only to
my three plantations; I mean my castle, country seat, and
enclosure in the woods, though in process of time my dread--
ful apprehensions began to wear away. .
Thus my circumstances for some time remained very
calm and undisturbed; though indeed, the terror which the
savages had put me in, spoiled some inventions for my own
conveniences. One of my projects was to brew me some
beer: a very whimsical one indeed, when it is considered,
that I had neither casks sufficient, nor could I make any
to preserve it in; neither had I hops to make it keep, yeast
to make it work, not a copper or kettle to make it boil.
Perhaps, indeed, after some years, I might bring this to
bear, as I had done other thin s. But now my inventions
were placed another way; am? day and night I could think
of nothing but how I might destroy some of these cannibals,
when proceedin to their bloody entertainments; and so
saving a victim rom being sacrificed, that he might afler-
wards become my servant. Many were my contrivances
for this purpose, and many more objections occurred, after
I had hatched them. I once contrived to dig a hole under
the place where they made their fire, and put therein five
or six pounds of gunpowder, which would consernentlyI__._._.

blow up all those that were near it; but then I was loth to
spend so much upon them, lost it should not do that certain
execution I desired, and only Ittlright and not kill them.
Haring laid this dcsi'fll aside, I awain proposed to myself
to lie privately III ambush in some convenient place, with
my three nuns double loaded, and let fly at them in the
midst ot their dreadtul eeremon ; and liming killed two
or three of them at every shot, fall upon the rest suddenly
\\ ith my three pistols, and let not one mother's son escape.
'1 his iIiIagiIIatioII pleased my t'IIIIcV so much that I used to
dream 0! it in the night time '10 put Ill) desilrn III e.\eL'u--

and twin a loltV hill, three miles distant, try it I could see

having waited in vain two or three months, it grew very
tiresome to me.

I new argued with myself, it was better for me never to

could; that an opposite conduct \Iould certainly proVe de-
structive; tor as it was scarcelv to be supposed I could kill
them all, I might be either ouirpowernd by the remainder,
or that some escaping might bring thousands to my eertaiii
destruction. And, indeed, religion took their part so much
as to convince me how contrary it was to my duty, to be
guilty of shedding human blood, innocent blood, innocent.moon one". 'l'l

as to me in particular, whatever they are to one another;
that I had nothing to do with it, but leave it to theGod
et' all pews anddominion, asI said before, to dotherein
what seemed convenient to his heavenly wisdom. And,
therefore, on m, knees, I thanked the Almi bty for deliver-
ing no from b oody 'tiness. and beggeg his protection
that I might never 1 into their hands.

Thus giving over an attempt which I had rashly b ,
I never ascended the hill on that occasion after-w ,; 1
only removed my boat, which lay on the other side of the
island, and every thing that belonged to her, towards the
east, into a little cove, that there m'ght not be the least
shadow of any boat near, or habitation upon the island.
My castle then became my cell, keeping always retired in
it, except when I went out to milk my sh oats, or my
little flock in the wood, which was quite out danger: for
sure I was, that these savages never came here with ex-
pectation to find any thing, and consequently never wan-
demd from the coast; however, as they might have several
times been on shore, as well before as afier my dreadful

state I might have been, had I suddenly met them, slen--

and how great would have been my amazement, if, instead

fifteen or twenty savages, who, having once set eir eyes

in uncertain mazes er labyrinths of doubt or hesitation,
what secret hint directs us in the right way, when we in-
tended to go out of it; nay perhaps contrary to our busi-
ness, sense, or inclination.

Anxieties of mind, and the care of my preservation, ut
a period to all future inventions and contrivances, eit er
for accommodation, or convenience, I now cared not to
drive a nail, chop a stick, fire a gun, or make a fire, lest
either the noise should be heard, or the smoke discover
me. And on this account I used to burn my earthen ware

rivately in a cave, which I found in the wood, and which
I made convenient for that purpose; the principal cause
that brought me here was to make charcoal, so that I
might bake and dress my bread and meat without any
danger.

At that time a curious accident happened to me, which
I shall now relate.

While I was cutting down some wood for making m
charcoal, I erceived a cavity behind a very thick branc
of underwoo . Curious to look into it, I attained its mouth,
and perceived it sufficient for me to stand upright in.

But when I had entered, having crept upon m hands
and feet through this strait, I found the roof hig or up,
I think about twenty feet. But surely never mortal saw
such a lorious sight before! the roof and walls of this
cave re ected a hundred thousand li hts to me from my
two candles, as though they were indented with shinin
gold, precious stones, or sparkling diamonds. And indee
it was the most deli htful cavity or rotto of its kind that
could be desired, Slough entirely ark. The floor was
dry and level, and had a kind of gravel upon it; no nau-
seous venomous creatures to be seen here, neither Ill,

entrance, and I be an to think, that even this might be very
necessary for my efence, and therefore resolved to make
it my principal magazine. I brought hither two fowling
pieces and three muskets, leaving only five pieces at my
castle, planted in the nature of cannon. In a barrel ofgun-
powder, which I took out of the sea, I brought away about
sixty pounds of good powder, which was not damaged; and
this, with a great quantity of lead for bullets, I removed

from my castle to this retreat, now fortified both by art and
nature.

I fancied myself now like one of the giants of old, who
were said to live in caves and holes among the rocks, inac-
cessible to any but themselves, or, at least, most dangerous
to attempt. And now I defied both the cunning and
stren h of the savages, either to find me out or to hurt me.

I t ink I was now in the twenty-third year of my reign,

and my thouphts much easier than formely, havmg .con-

trived severa pretty amusements, and diversions to
away the time in a pleasant manner. By this time my
retty Poll had learned to speak English, and pronounce
iis words very articulately and plum; so that for many
hours we used to chat together after a very familiar manner,
and he lived no less than twenty-six years. My dog, which
was nineteen years old, sixteen of which he lived with me,
died some time ago, of mere old e. As for my cats,
they multiplied so fast, that I was orced to kill or drive
them into the woods, except two or three which became
my particular favorites. Besides these, I continually kept
two or three household kids about me, which I taught to
feed out of my hand, and two more parrots which could
talk indifferent] , and call Robinson Crusoe, but not so
excellently as t e first, by my not taking so much aina
with them. I had also several sea {owls which had80 use me mean-rum or

wounded and cut their wings; and growing tame they used
to breed among the low trees about my castle walls, all of
which made my abode very agreeable.

But what unforeseen events suddenly destroy the enjoy-
ment: of this uncertain state of life, when we least expect,
them! It was now the month of December, and the particu-
lar time in my harvest, which required my attendance in
the fields; when going out pretty early in the morning, be-
fore it was day-light, there appeared to me from the sea-
shore, a flaming light, about two miles from me at the east
end of the island, where I had observed some savages had
been before, not on the other side, but to my great affliction
it was on in side of the island.

Struck With a terrible surprise, and my usual apprehen--
sions, that the savages would perceive my improvements, I
returned directly to my castle, pulled the ladder after me,
making all things look as wild and natural as I possibly
could. In the next place, I put myself in a posture of de-
fence, loaded my muskets and pistols, and committing my-
self to God's rotection, I resolved to defend myself till at
last breath. wo hours after, impatient for intelligence,
set my ladder up to the side of the hill, where there was a
flat place, and then pulling the ladder alter me, ascended
to the top, where laying myself on my belly, with my per-
spective glass I perceived no less than nine naked savages,
sitting round a small fire, eating as I supposed, human flesh,
with their two canoes hauled on shore, waiting for the flood
to carry them ofi' again. The consternation I was in at this
sight, especially seeing them near me, was very great; but
w en I perceived their coming must be always with the
current of the ebb, I became more easy in my thoughts,
being fully convinced, that I might go abroad with securit
all the time of flood, if they were not before landed. Ami1

indeed, this proved just as I imagined; for no sooner did
they all take boat and paddle awn , but the tide made north-
west. When I saw them gone, took two guns upon my
shoulders, and placing a couple of pistols in my belt, with
my great sword hanging by my side, I went to the hill,
where at first I made a discovery of these cannibals, and
then saw there had been three canoes more of the savages
on shore at that place, which with the rest, were making
over to the main land.

But nothing could be more horrid to me, when going to
the place of sacrifice, the blood, the bones, and other man-
gled parts of human bodies appeared in my sight; and so
tired was I with indignation, that I was fully resolved to be
revenged on the first that came there, though I lost my
life in the execution. It then appeared to me, that the visits
which they made to this island are not very frequent, it
being fifteen months before they came again: but still I
was very uneasy, by reason of the dismal a prehensious of
their surprising me unawares; nor dared I offer to fire a
gun on that side of the island where they used to appear,
lest, taking the alarm, they might return with many hundred
canoes, and then God only knows in what manner I should
have made my end. Thus was I a year or more before I
saw any of these devouring cannibals again.

But to wave this, the following accident, which demands
attention, for a while, eluded the force of my thoughts in
revenging myself on those heathens.

On the 16th of May (acording to my wooden calendar,)
the wind blew exceedingly hard, accompanied with abun-
dance ot' thunder and ii htning all day, and succeeded by
a very stormy night. he seeming anger of the heavens
made me have recourse to my Bible. \Vhilst I was serious-
ly pondering upon it, I was suddenly alarmed With the noise

; Such an unusual surprise made me start up in a Inmate;
when, with my ladder, ascending the mountain as before,
that very moment a flush of tire prestiged the report of
another gun, which I presently heard. and found it was
from the part of the sen where the current drove me away,
I could not but then think. that this must be. a ship in dis-
tress, and that these were the melancholy signals tor a
speedy deliverance. Great. indeed, was my sorrow upon
this occasion; but my Inhors to assist them must have I
proved altogether 'ain and l'ruitles However, I brought
together all the dry wood that was at hand, and making a v
pretty large pile, set it on tire on the hill. I was certain
they plainly perceived it, by their tiring another gun as soon
as it began to blaze, and after that several more from the
t saute quarter. All night. long I kept up my tire; and when
the air cleared up, I perceived something a great way at. l
sea, directly east, hut could not distinguish what it was, -
even with my glass, the weather being so very foggy out i
at sea. However, keeping my eyes directly fixed upon it, 3"
and perceiving it did not stir, I presently Concluded it must i
he a ship at anchor, and so very hasty was I to be satisfied,
that. taking my gun, I went to the south-west part of the i
I island. to the same roe s where I had been formerly driven
away by the current; in which time, the weather heing
perl'eetly cleared up to my great sorrow, I perceived the
wreck of a ship east away upon those hidden rocks I had
found when I was out with my boat; and which, by making
a kind of an eddy, Were the occasion of my preservation.
When I considered seriously every thing concerning this
wreck, and could perceive. no room to suppose any of them
saved, I cannot explain, by any possible force of words,
what longings my soul felt on this occasion| otten breaking
out in this manner. Oh! that there had been but two or
three, nay, even one person saved, that we might have lived
together, conversed with, and coml'orted one another! and
so much were my desires moved, that when I repeated
these words, " oh! that there had been but one ! " my hands
would so clench together, and my fingers press the palms
of my hands so close, that, had any soft thing been be-
tween, they would have crushed it, while my teeth would
strike together, and set against each other so strong, that
it required some time for me to part them.

Till the last year of my being on this island, I never
knew whether or not any had been saved out of this ship.
I had the affliction, some time after, to see the corpse of
a drowned boy come on shore, at the end of the island
which was next the shipwreck; there was nothing on
him but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-knead linen
drawers, and a blue linen shirt, but no particular mark to
guess what nation he was of. In his pocket were two pieces
of eight, and a tobacco pipe, the last of which I prefered
much more than I did the first. And now the calmness of
the sea tempted me to venture out in my boat to this wreck,
not only to get something necessary out of the ship, but
perhaps, some living creature might be on board, whose
life I mi ht preserve. This had such an influence upon
my min , that immediately I went home, and prepared
every thing necessary for the voyage, carrying on board
my boat, provisions of all sorts, with a good quantity of
rum, fresh water, and a compass: so putting ofi', I paddled
the canoe along the shore, till I came to the northeast part
of the island, from whence I was to launch into the ocean;
but here the current ran so violently, and appeared so
terrible, that my heart began to fail me; foreseeing, that
if I was driven into any of these currents, I might be carried
not only out of the reach or sight of the island, but even
inevitably lost in the boiling surges of the ocean.

So oppressed was Int these troubles, that I gave over
my enterprize, sailing to a little creek on the shore, where,
stepping out, I sat me down on a rising hill, very pensive
an thoughtful. I then perceived that the tide was turned,
and the flood come on, which made it impracticable for mo

to 0 out for so many hours.

fI'hat night, I reposcd myself in my canoe, covered with
my watch-cont instead of a blanket, the heavens being my
tester. I set out with the first of the tide full north, till I
felt the benefit of the current, which carried me at a great
rate eastward, yet not with such impetuosity as before, as
to take from me all government of my canoe: so that in two
hours I came up to the wreck, which appeared to me a most
melancholy si ht. It seemed to bee Spanish vessel by its
building, stuc fast between two rocks; her stern and quar-
ters beaten to pieces by the sea; her main--mast and fore-
msst were brought off by the bbard; that is, broken short
off. As I approached nearer, I perceived a dog on board,
who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried: and no sooner
did I call him, but the poor creature jumped into the sen,
out of whichI took him up almost furnished with hunger
and thirst: so that when I gave him a cake of bread, no
-- ravenous wolf could devour it more greedily; and he drank
to that degree of fresh water, that he would have burst him-
selt'had I suffered him.

The first sight I met with in the ship, were two men
drowned in the cock-room, or forecastle, enclosed in one
another's arms: hence I very probably supposed, that when
the vessel struck in the storm, so high and incessantly did
the waters break in and over her, that the men not bein
able to bear it, were strangled by the constant rushing 0?

the waves. There were several casks of liquor, whethet
wine or brandy I could not be positive, which lay in the
lower hold, as were plainly perceptible by the ebbing out of
the water, yet were two large for me to pretend to meddle
with: likewise I perceived several chests, which I supposed
nelonged to the seamen, two of which I got into my boat,
without examining what was in them. What became of
the sailors I could not certainly tell; and all her riches sig-
nified nothing at that time to any body.

Searching farther, I . found a cask, containing about
twenty gallons full of liquor, which with some labor I got into
my boat; in the cabin were several muskets, which I let
remain there; but- took away with me a reat powder born,
with about four pounds of powder in it. 31 took also a fire-
shovel and tongs, with two brass kettles, a copper pot to
make chocolate, and a grid-iron; all which were extremely
necessary tome, especially the fire-shovel and tongs. And
so with this cargo, accompanied by my dog, I came away,
the tide serving for that purpose: and the same evening,
about an hour within night, I attained the island, afier the
greatest toil and fatigue imaginable.

That night I reposed my weary limbs in the boat, relolv
ing the next morning to harbor what I had gotten, in m) .
new found under-ground grotto; and not carry my cargo
home to my ancient castle. Having refreshed myself, and
got all my etfects on shore, I next proceeded to examine
the particulars; and so tapping the cask, I found the li nor
to be a kind of rum, but not like what we had at the ra-
zils, nor indeed near so good. At the opening of the
chest, several things appeared very useful to me; for in.
stance, I found in one, a very fine case of bottles, contain~
m the finest and best sort of cordial waters; each bottle
.e d about three pints, curiously tipt with silver. I found
also two pots full nfthe choicest sweetmeats, and two more
which the water had utterly spoiled. There were likewise
several good shirts, exceedingly welcome to me. and about
one dozen and a half of white. linen lnmdkerehiols, and
colored neekcloths, the former of whieh were absolutely
necessary for wiping my face in a hot day; and in the till,
1 found three bags of money, in one of which, decently
wrnpt up in a piece of paper. were six doubloons of gold,
and some small bars and wedges of the same metal, which
I believe might weigh near a pound. In the. other chest, I
only found some clothes of very little value, and about two
pounds of tine glazed powder, in three flasks, kept us I
believe, for charging their fowlingr pieces on any oceusion,
so that, on the whole, I tirade very little of this voyage.
The money was indeed as mere dirt to me, useless and
unprofitable, all which I would have freely parted with,
for two or three pair of English shoes and stockings, things
that for many years l had not worn, except those which I
had lately taken otl'the feet ofthe unfortunate. men I found
drowned in the wreck, yet not so good as English shoes
either for ease or serviee. I found no gold in the. second
chest; so concluded that what I took from the first belong-
ed to an otlieer, the hitter a l mining to have a much infe-
rior person for its owner. However, as despicable as the
money seemed, I likewise lugged it to my cave, laying it
up securely, as I did the rest. of my cargo, and intending
to seek out, and return it to the family of the unfortunate
owner, if ever I should return to Europe; and after I had
done all this, I returned back to my boat, rowing or pad-
dling her along till I came to my old harbor, where I
carefully laid her a . and so made the best of my way to
my castle. Whan larrived there, every thing seemed safe

and quiet; so that now, my only business was to repose
myself after my wonted manner, and take care of my
domestic affairs. But though I might have lived very easy,
us wanting? for nothing absolutely needl'ul; yet still I was
more vigiant than usual, upon account 0 the savages,
never going much abroad; or if I did, it was to the east
port of the island, where I was well assured that the sav-
ugns never came, and where I might not be troubled to
curry such a heavy load of weapons for my defence, as I
was obliged to do it' I went the other way.

Two years did I live in this anxious condition, in all
which time, contrary to my former resolutions, my head
was filled with nothing but projects and designs how I
might escape from this island; and so much were my
wandering thoughts bent upon a rambling disposition, that
had I had the same boat that I went from Salee in, I
should have ventured once more to the uncertainty of the
raging ocean.

Having retired to my castle, after my late voyage to the
ship, my frigate laid up and secured, as usual, and m
condition the same as before, except being richer, though
had as little occasion for riches as the Indians of Peru had
for gold, before the cruel Spaniards came'among them;
one night in March, being the rainy season, in the four
and twentieth year of my solitude, I lay down to sleep,
very well in health, without distemper, pain, or uncommon
uneasiness either of body or mind; yet notwithstanding, I
could not compose myself to sleep all the night long.
this tedious while. it is impossible to express what innumer--
able thoughts came into my head. I traced quits over,
the whole history of my life in miniature, from my utmost
remembrance of things till I came to this island; and then
proceeded to examine every action and passage that had
occurred since I had taken possession of my kingdom. In
my reflections upon the latter, I was comparing the happy
posture of my affairs in the beginning of my reign, to this
life of anxiety, fear, and concern, since I had discovered
the print of a foot in the sand; that while I continued
without apprehension, I was incapable of feeling the dread
and terror Inow sutl'ered. How thankful rather ought I
to have been for the knowledge of my danger, since the
greatest happiness a man can be possessed of is to have
sufficient time to provide against it? How stupendous is
the goodness of Providence, which set such narrow bounds
to the sight and knowledge of human nature, that while
men walk in the midst of so many dangers, they are kept
serene and calm, by having the events of things hid from
their eyes, and knowing nothing of those many dangers
that surround them, till perhaps they are dissipated and
vanished away.

About a year and a half after, one morning early, I was
very much surprised by seeing no less than five canoes
all on shore together, on my side of the island, and the
savages that belonged to them all landed, and out of
my sight. Upon which, much dispirited and perplexed,
I lay still in my castle; which, however, I put in a proper
posture for an attack; and having formerly provided all
that was necessary, was soon ready to enter upon an
engagement, should they attempt it. Having waited for
some time, my impatient temper would let me bear it no
longer; I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and, as
usual, ascended up to the top of the hill at two stages,
standing, however, in such a manner, that my head did
not appear above the hill, so that they could not easily
perceive me: and here, by the assistance of my perspec-
tive glass, I observed no less than thirty in number around
a fire, feasting upon what meat they had dressed: how they301:1an causes. 89

coaxed it, or what it was, I could not then perfectly tell;
but they were all dancing and eapering about the times,
using many frightful and barbarous estures.

But while, with a curious eye, was beholding these
wretches, my spirit sunk within me, when l perceived them
drag two miserable creatures from the boats, to act afresh
the dreadful tragedy, as I supposed the had done before.
It was not long before one of them t'el upon the ground,
knocked down as I suppose, with a club or wooden sword,
for that was their manner; while two or three others went
immediately to work, cutting him open for their cookery,
and then fell to devour him as they had done the former:
while the last unhappy captive was left by himself, till such
time as the were ready for him. The poor creature
looked roun him with a sorrowful eye, trembling at the
thoughts of death; yet seeing himself a little at liberty,
nature, that very moment, as it were, inspired him with
hopes of life: he started away from them, and ran, with in-
credible swiftness, along the sands, directly to that part of
the coast where my ancient and venerable castle stood.

You may well imagine I was dreadfully affrighted upon
this occasion, when as I thought, they pursued him-in a
whole body, all running towards my palace. And now,
indeed, I expected that he would certainly fly to my grove
for protection. However, my spirits beginning to recover,
I still kept upon my guard; and I now plainly perceived,
there were but three men out of the number that ursued
him. I was infinitely pleased at the swiftness wit which
the poor creature ran from his pursners, gaining so much

round upon them, that I plainly perceived, could he thus
told it out for half an hour, there was not the least doubt
|)ut he would save his life from the power of his enemies

Between them and my castle, there was a creek. tho90 use no Auras-runes or

very same whieh I smiled into with all my efl'ems from tho

Iliueh feared the poor \'it'iillt would be tuken, if he could

ceived could not swim. huppily for themselves, returned to
their company, while the other, with no equnl courage but
much less swit'tness uttuined the other side, us though he
wus resolved never to give over the pursuit. And now or
never, I thought, wus the time for me to irocure me n
servunt, companion, or ussistunt, und that wus decreed
'1)! Providence to he. the instrument to save this poor
creature's life. I immediately descended my two hidders
with the greatest expedition; I took up my two guns.
which, I suid before, were ut the bottom ot' them; and

outdo nearer the sea. in u word, tuking a short cut down
the hill, 1 interposed between the pursuer and pursued, hul-
looing aloud to the luttor, who venturing to look lmek, was
no doubt, as much territied ut me us at the enemy from whom
he fled. I beckoned to him, with my hand, to return buck.
und, in the meantime, udvunced towurds the pursucr. I
was very unwillin to tire lest the rest should hear, though,
at that distance,Y= questioned whether they could or no;
and being out of sight of the smoke, they could not easily
have known what to make of it. The savage stopped as
if he had been amazed; when, advancing towurds him, I
could perceive him take his bow from his back, and,alter fixing an arrow to it, preparing to shoot at me, and,

without dispute, he might have lodged it in my breast;
but in this absolutely necessary case of self-preservation, I
iunncdiately fired, and shot him dead, just as his hand was
going to draw the fatal string. All this while, the savage,
who had fled before, stood still, and had the satisfaction to
see his enemy killed, as he thought. who designed to take
away his life; so afl'righted was he with the fire and noise
of my piece, that he stood as it were like Lot's wife, fixed
and immovable without either sense or motion. This
obliged me to halloo to him again, making the plainest
signs I could to him to draw nearer. I perceived he under-
stood these tokens, b his approaching to me a little way,
when. as if afraid I should kill him too, he stopped again.
Several times did he advance, and as often stop in this
manner, till, coming more to my view, I perceived him
tremblin , as if he was to undergo the same fate. Upon
which I ooked upon him with a smiling countenance, and
still beckoning to him; at length he came close to me, and
kneeled down, kissed the ground, laid his head upon it, and
taking me by the foot, set it upon his head; which, as I
understood afterwards, was a token of swearing to be my
slave for ever. I took him up, and making much of him,
encouraged him in the best manner I could. The greatest
astonishment that my new servant conceived, was at the
manner of killing the savage at such a distance, without a
bow and arrow; and such was his longing desire to know
it, that he first pointed to the dead carcass, and then made
signs to me to grant him leave to go to it. Upon which I
bid him go, and, as well as I 'could, made him sensible I
granted his request. But when he came there how wonder-
ully was he struck with amazement! First, he turned it on
one side. then on another, wondering he could perceive no
 

quantity of blood, he bleeding inwardly: and after ant
ticiontly admiring the wound the bullet had made in thm
breast, he took up his bow and arrows, and came back
again; u )0" which, I turned to go away, making signs to
hint to To low, lest the rest missing their companion. might
eome in pursuit ot' him. and this I found he understood very
well, by making me. to understand that his design was to
bury it, that it might not be seen; and which by signs again
I made him sensible. I very much approved of. Immediate-
ly he fell to work, and never was grave-digger more dex-
terous in the World than he was; for in an instant. as I
might say, he serapt'd a large hole in the sands with his
hands. sullieient to bury it in: there he dragged it. and,
without any ceremony. covered it over. lthen called him
away. and instead of carrying him directly to 1th castle at
first, I conveyed him to my care on the fit me! i art of the
island. >
\Veary and t'aint, hungry and thirsty' undoubtedly must
this poor creature be, supported chiefly hy the vivaeity
of spirit, and uneonnnun transports of joy that his deliv-
erance occasioned. Here lgave him bread and a bunch
of raisins to eat. and water to drink, on which he fed very
eheertiilly' to hisexoeeding reli'eshinent. I then made him
a convenient bed. with a parcel of rice straw, and a blanket
upon it, (a bed which i used myself sometimes.) and then
pointing to it. made signs for him to lie down to sleep. upon
which the poor creature went to take a welcome repose.
Indeed he was a very comely, handsome. young fellowI
extremely well made, with straight long limbs, not too
Iar 0, but tall and well shaped, and, as near as I could
rec on. about twenty-six years of ago. His countenance
had nothing in it fierce or surly. but rather a sortofmajesty
in his face; and especially when he smiled, ho had all the
sweetness of a European. His hair was not curled like
wool, as many of the blacks are, but long and black, with
the most beautiful, et careless tresses spreading over his
shoulders. He hady a very high and large forehead, with
a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness In his eyes. His
skin was not so tawny as that of the Americans; but rather
of a light dun olive color, that had something agreeable
in it. though not very easy to give a description of. His
face was round and plump, with a small nose, very difl'erent
from the flatness of the negroes, a pretty small mouth, thin
lips, fine teeth, very well set, and white as the driven snow.
In a word, such handsome features, and exact symmetry in
every part, made me consider, that I had saved the life of
no Indian prince, no less graceful and accomplished than
the great Oroonoke, whose memorable behavior and un-
happy contingencies of life, have charmed the world, both
to admiration of his person, and compassion for his suffer-

he runs from the cave towards me in my enclosure, and
laying himself down on the ground, in the lowest prostration,
made all the antic estures imaginable, to express his thank-
fulness to me for eing his deliverer. He laid down his
head again upon the ground, close to my foot, and set In
other foot upon his head, as he had done before, making
the signs of subjection, servitude, and submission imagina-
ble, to let me understand he would serve me as long as his
life endured. As I understood him in many things, I made
him sensible I was very well pleased with him; and, in a
little time, I began to speak to him, and teach him how to
talk to me again. ,

In the first place, I made him understand his name was to
be Friday, because it was upon that day I saved his life; I
then taught him to say Master, which I made him sensible
was to be my name; I likewise taught him to say yes and
no, and to know what they meant. I gave him some milk
in an earthen pot, making him view me while I drank it
before him, and soaked my bread in it; I gave him a. cake
of bread, and caused him to soak it likewise, to which he
readily consented, making signs of the greatest satisfac-
tion imaginable.

All that night did I keep him there; but no sooner did
the morning light appear, than I ordered him to arise and
come along with me, with certain tokens that I Would give
him some clothes like mine, at which he seemed very
glad, being stark naked, without the least covering what-
ever. As we passed by the place where the man had been
interred, my man pointed directly to his grave, showing me
the marks that he had made to find it again, giving me to
understand, by signs, that we should dig him up and devour
him. At this I appeared extremely displeased, expressed
my utmost abhorrence, as if I would vomit at the apprehen-
sions of it, beckoning with my hand to come away, which
he did with the greatest reverence and submission. After
this, [conducted him to the top of the hill, to view if the
rest of the savages were yet remaining there; but when I
looked through my perspective glass, I could see no ap-
pearance of them, nor of their canoes; so that it was very
evident they never minded their deceased companion whom
we had slain; which if they had, they would surely have
searched for or left one boat behind for him to follow, alter
he returned from his pursuit.

Curiosity, and a desire of satisfaction, animating me
with courage, to see this scene of barbarity, Itook my man
Friday with me to the place of their bloody entertainment
But when I came there, I was struck with the utmost horror
at so dreadful a spectacle, whilst Friday was no way con-
cerned about it, being no doubt in his turn, one of these
devourers. Here lay several human bones, there several
pieces of mangled flesh, half eaten, man led and scorched,
whilst streams of blood ran promiscuous y as water from a
fountain. As I was musing on this dreadful sight, Friday
took all the pains he could by particular signs, to make me
understand that they had brought over four prisoners to feast
upon, three of whom they had eaten up, and that he was
the fourth, pointing to himself: that there having been a
bloody battle between them and his great king, in the just
defence of whom he was taken prisoner, with many others;
all of these were carried off to different places to be de-
voured by their conquerors; and that it was his fortune to
be brought hither by these wretches for the very same pur-

pose.
At'ter I was made sensible of these things, I caused Fri-
day to glather those horrid remains, and lay them together

upon a cap, which I ordered to be set on fire, and burnt
them to ashes; my man, however, still retained the nature
of a cannibal, having a hankering stomach after some of
the flesh: but such an extreme ahhorrence did I express
at the least appearance of it, that he durst not but conceal
it; for I made him very sensible, that if he attempted any
such thing, I would certainly shoot him.

This being done, I carried my man with me to my castle,
and gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had taken out
of the poor gunner's chest before mentioned; and which,
with a little alteration, fitted him very well: in the next
place, I made him a jerkin of goat skin, such as my skill
was able to manage, and indeed I thought myself then a
tolerably good tailor I gave him also a cap, which I made
of a. hare's skin. very convenient and fashionable. Thus
being clothed tolernlily well, my man was no less proud of
his haliit than 1 was at seeing him in it. Indeed he went.
very awkwardly at first, but by use, at length he took to
them very well.

My next concern was. where I should lodge him; and
that l might do well by him, and yet he perfectly easy my-
self, I erected a tent for him in the. vacant place between
my two liirtitications, in the inside of the last, and the out-
side of the lirst; and as there was an entrance or door into
mycnve, I made. a formal framed door-case. and a door to
open on the inside; I barred it up in the night-time, taking
in my ladders too. so that, was my man to prove treacher-
ous, there could he no way to come. at me in the inside of
my innermost wall, without making so much noise in getting
over, that it must needs waken me; for my first wall had
now a complete roof over it of long poles, spreading over
my tent, and leaning up to the side of the mountain, which
\'as again laid across with smaller sticks instead of lnths,
and thatched over to a great thickness with the rice straw,
which was as strong as reeds; and at the. hole of the place,
left on purpose to go in or out by the ladder, 1 had placed
a kind of a trap-door, which. if it had been attempted on
the outside, would not have opened at all, but have fallen
down, and made a great. noise; and as to my weapons,
every night I took them all to my lied-side.

But there was no occasion for this precaution; for surely
never Master had a more. sincere. faithful, and lovin r servant
than Friday proved to me. \Vithout passion, sn lcnness,
or design, perfectly obliging nnd cngagin , his ntchtions
were as much tied to me as those of a chil to his parents;
and I might venture to say, he would have sacrificed his
life for the saving of mine, upon any occasion whatsoever,
and, indeed, the many testimonies he gave me of this, suf-
ficiently convinced me that I had no occasion to use all
these precautions.

I had not been above two or three do. a returned to my
castle, but my chief design was, how I s ould bring Friday
of from his horrid way of feeding; and, to take from him
that inhuman relish he by habit had been accustomed to, I
thought it my duty to let him taste other flesh, which m' ht
the rather tempt him to the same abhorrence I so 0 en
expressed against their accursed way of livin . Upon
which, one morning, I took him out wrth me, wit an inten-
tion to kill a kid out of the flock, and bring it home, and
dress it. As I was going, I perceived a she oat lying
down in the shade, and two young kids sitting by er. Im-
mediutely I catched hold of my man Friday, and bidding
him stand still, and not stir, I presented my iece, and shot
one of the kids. My poor servant, who ha at a distance
perceived me kill his adversary, and yet did not know by
what means, or how it was done, stood trembling and sur-
prised, and looked so amazed, that I thought he would have
sunk into the earth. He did not see the kid I aimed at, or
behold I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat to see if he
was not wounded, thinking my resolution was to kill him;
for coming to me, he fell on his knees, earnestl pronounc-
ing many things which I did not understand t 0 meaning
of; which at len th I perceived was, that I would not take
away his life. findeed, so much compassion had I for this
creature, that it was with difiiculty I refrained from tears.
But, however, as another sort of countenance was necessa-
ry, and to convince him that I would do him no harm, I took
him, smiling, by the hand, then laughed at him, and point-
ing to the kid which I had slain, made signs to him to fetch
it, which accordingly he did. No less curious was he in.___ . . ,

98 ' LIFE AND ADVENTURES or

viewing how the creature was killed, than he was before
in heholdiug the. Indian; which, while he was admiring, I
charged my gun again, and presently perceived a great
thwl like a hawk, perehiug upon a tree within shot; and,
therefore, to let I'l'iday understand what I was going to
do, I called him to me again, pointing at the tow], which
I found to he a parrot. I made him understand that I
would shoot and kill that bird; accordingly-'1 tired, and
hadc him look, when inuuediately he saw the parrot tilll
down. Again he stood like one aniazed. notwithstanding
all I had said to him: and the more eonthunded he in ,
heenuse he did not pereeive me put any thing in my gun.
As for it in particular, he would not so much as touch it
for several days alter; hut Would (some and communicate
his thoughts to it. and talk to it. as it' the senseless piece
had understood and answered him; all this I could per-
ceive him to do. whea he thought my hack was turned, the
chief intent ot' which was, to desire it not to kill him, as I
atterward came to understand.

I never strove to prevent his admiration, nor hinder him
from these eomiral gestures he used on such occasions;
but when hix astonishment was a little over, I made tokens
to him to run and fetch the parrot that I had shot; which
accordingly he did, staying some time longer than usual,
by reason that the hird not being quite dead, had fluttered
some way farther from the place where she. fell. In the
mean time, as he was looking for her, I took the advan-
tage of charging my gun again, that so I might be ready
for any other mark that ofl'ered; but nothing more occur-
red at the time. So I brought home the kid, and the same
evening took ofl' the skin, and divided the carcass as well
as I could. Part of the flesh I stewed and boiled in a pot
I had for this purpose. And then, spreading my table, I
 

sat down, giving my man some of it to eat, who was won-
dcrt'ully pleased, and seemed to like it very well: but what
was the most surprising to him was to see me out salt with
it: upon which he made me understand, that the salt was
very bad for me; when putting a little into his month, he
seemed to nausente it in such a manner, at: to spit and
sputter at it, and then washed his mouth with fresh water:
but to show him how contrary his opinion was '10 mine, I
put some meat into my month without salt, and feigned to
spit and sputter as much for want of it, as he had done at
it; yet all this proved of no signification to Friday, and it
was a long while before he could endure any salt in his
meat or brothyand even then but a small quantity.

Thus, having fed him snfliciently with boiled meat and
broth at that time, the next day I was resolved to feast him
with a roasted piece of the kid. And havin no spit to
fasten it, nor jack to turn it, I made use of t mt common
artifice which many of the people of England have, that
is, to put two poles upon each side of the fire, and one
across on the top, hanging the meat thereon with a string,
and so turning it round continually, till it was sufficiently
roasted. This practice caused great admiration in my
man Friday, being quite another way than that to whic
the savages were accustomed. But when he came to taste
the sweetness and tenderness of the flesh, he expressed his
entire satisfaction above a thousand different ways. As I
could not but understand his meanin , you may be sure I
was as wonderfully pleased, especial] when he made it
also very plain to me, that he would never, while he lived,
eat man's flesh more. '

It was new high time I should set my new servant to
work; so next day, I put him to beat out some corn, and
sift it in the same manner as I had done before. And
really the fellow was very quick and handy m the execu-
tion of any thing I ordered him to go about. I made him
understand that it was to make bread for us to eat, and
afterwards let him see me hake it. In short, he did every
thing as I ordered him in a little time as well as Icould
perform it myself.

But now, considering that I had two months to feed in-
stead of one. it was necessary that I should provide more
ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn
than I commonly used to do; upon which. I marked out.
a larger piece of land, fencing it in the. same manner as I
had done before; in the execution of which, I must give
. Friday this good word. that no man could work more
hardy, or with better will than he did; and when I made
him sensible that it was for bread to serve him as well as
me, he then very passionately made me understand, that t
he thought I had much more labor on his account than I.
had for myself; and that no pains or diligence should be
wanting in him, il' I would hut direct him in those works
wherein he might proceed.

I most certainly own. that this was the most pleasant
year I ever had in the island; for after some time, Friday
began to talk pretty well, and understood the names of
those things which I was wont to call for, and the. places
where I used to send him. So that m long silent tongue,
which had been so many years unused): except when pray-
ing to God, or conversing with my poll, now began to be
occupied in teaching, and talking to my man Friday for
indeed I had such a singular satisfaction in the fellow
himself, so innocent did his simple and unfeigned honesty
appear more and more every day, that I really began
entirely to love him; and, for his part, I believe there was
no love lost, and that his nature had been more charmed
by my exceeding kindness, and his all'ection more placed
upon me, than upon any other object whatsoever among
his own countrymen.

I once had a great desire to try if he had any hankering
inclination to his own country sin: and by this time,
having taught him English so we I, that he could give me
tolerable answers to any question which I demanded, I
asked him whether that nation to which he belonged ever
conquered in battle? This question made Friday smile,
and to which he answered, "Yes, yes, we always fight
the better;" as much as to say, they always it" the better
in fight. You say, said I, that you always fig ttho better;

why then, Friday, how came you to be taken prisoner?
Friday. But for all that, my nation beat much.
Master. How, say you, beat! if your nation beat then,
how came you to be taken?

Fmtay. The more many mans than my nation, in the
place where me was, they take one, two, three and me;
my nation much overheat them in the yonder place where
me no was, there my nation mans beat one, two, three
great thousands.

Master. Then why did not your men recover you from
the hands of our enemies?

Friday. hey run one, two, or three, and me; they
make all go into the canoe; my nation have no canoe that
time.

Master. 'Tis very well, Friday; but what does your
nation do with the prisoners they take; Do they carry
them away and eat them as they have done?

Friday. Yes, yes, my nation eat mans too, eat up all.

Master. To what place do they carry them to be de-
voured?

Friday. Go tr ether nations where they think
IMasIIIr. Do they bring them hither?
I Friday. Yes, come over hither, come over other place i
IMusIcIn And have you been with them here, Friday?

Friday. Yes, InII been here, (pointing to the northwes'
ut the island, being the side whiIre they used to Iaud., \

"lhus havinIr Imtteu what nee ount 1 could from my man,
I plainly underStood, that he had been as bad as any ot
the rest of the CI Innibals, having been founerly union" the
sa' ages who used to come on shore on the larthestn paIt I
ot the island, upon the same bloody occasions as he was
brouIrht hither for: and some lllllt' utter, 1 carried him to
that place wherI be pointed; and no sooner did he come
there, but he presently knew the "round, signity'ing to me

Women and a young (I hild; but as he could not e.\plIIin the
number in English, he. did it by so many stones in a row,
making II siIrII to me to count them.

My next question was, how law it was from the island to
the shore, and whether :Imoes were not otten lost III the
ocean? to which he answered. there was no danger; that i,
no canoes were ever lost; but that after a little way out to
l the sea, there was It strong eur,rent and a. wind always one
l way, in the ntternoon. 'lhis l thoIIIIht at first to be no
I more than the so ts ot title, of Iroing out or coming in; but
I atterwurds understood it was occasioned by the great
draught and retlux, ot the IniIrhty river OroeIIoko, in the
mouth or wait ot which, I imagined my kin-Idem lIiy; and
that the land which l perceived to the west, and nor,thwest
must be the great island "IlIinidad, on the north of the river.

'IVell, you may be sure, this knowledge, which the im--
perfect information of my man had led me to, WIN very
comfortable to me, and made me so curious 113 f0 ask him,
how 1 might depart trom this island, and get amongst those

_________lwhite men? He told me, "Yes, yes, I mi ht go in two
canoes." In two canoes, thought I, what 063 my man
mean. And, indeed it was a long time before I understood
his meaning, which was, that it must be a large boat, as
big as two canoes, able to bear with the waves, and not so
liable to be overwhelmed as one must be.

I believe there is no state of life but what may be happy,
if people would but endeavor for their part to make it so.
He is not the happiest man that has the most riches, but
he that is content with what he hath. Before I had my
servant, I thought myself miserable till I had him; and
now that I had enjoyed the happy benefits of him, I still
complained, and begged a deliverance from a place of
retirement, ease and lenty, where Providence had sulfi-
cicntly blessed me. n a word, from this time, I enter-
tained some hopes, that one time or other, I mi ht find an
opportunity to make my escape from this islan , and that
this poor savage might be a great furtherance thereto.

I now began to instruct my servant, in the saving know-
ledge of the true Deity, in which the directions of God's
hol Spirit assisted me.

1?: riday, said I, you must know, that before this world
was made, there was an Almighty Being existing, by
whose power all things were made, and whose majesty
shall have no end. To be glorified and adored by beings
of a heavenly nature, he created angels and are angels,
that is, glorified spirits resembling himself, to encompass
his throne, eternally singing forth his praise, in the most
heavenly sounds and divine harmony.

I found it easy enough to imprint the right notions in his
mind of God: for nature assisted me in all my arguments,
to show him plainly the necessity of a great and overruling,
governing power, of a secret directing providence, and ofthe equity and reasonableness of paying adoration to our
Creator.

1 then entered into a long discourse with him, upon the
subject of the world's redemption by the Savior of it, and
the doctrine of repentance preached from heaven, together
with an holy faith in our blessed Redeemer, Jesus Christ.

By the constant application I made of the Scriptures, as
I read them to my man Friday, I earnestly endeavored to
make him understand every part ol'them as much as lay in
my power. He also, on the other hand, by his very serious
questions and inquiries, made me a much better proficient
in Scripture knowledge, than I should have been by my
own private reading and study.

You may well suppose, that, by the frequent discourse
we had together, my uum and I became most intimately
acquainted, and that there was very little that I could say,
but what Friday understood; and indeed, he spoke very
fluently, though it was but broken English. I now took a
particular pleasure in relating all my adventures, especially
those that occurred since my being cast on this island.
made him understand that Wonderful mystery, as he conceiv-
ed, of gunpowder and ballet, and taught him how to shoot. I
also presented to him a knife, which pleased him exceeding-
ly, making him a belt, with a frog haugin thereto, like
those in which we wear hangers in Englan ; and instead
of a hanger to put in the frog, I gave him a hatchet, which
was not only as good, but even a better weapon upon many
occasions. In a word my manthus accoutred, looked upon
himself as great as Don Quixote, when that celebrated
champion went to combat the windmill.

I next gave him a very particular description of my mis-
fortune in being shipwrecked; showing him, as near as I
could, the place where the ship lay, which had been gone
long before; but I brought him to the rutns of my boat,
uhich, before, my whole strength could not move, but now
was almost rotten and fallen to pieces. I observed my
man Friday to view this boat with an uncommon curiosity;
which when he had done, he stood ondering agreat while,
and said nothing. At last, said I, E'riday, what makes you
-onder so much? He replied, " 0 master, me see like
'oat come to place at my nation."

It was some time, indeed, before I understood what in
man meant; but examining strictly into it, I plainly foun
that such another boat, resembling mine, had come upor.
the country where he dwelt: that is to say, by his farther
explanation, that the boat was driven there through stress
of weather.

Indeed Friday answered my demands very well, making
every thing plain to my understanding; but beyond measure
was I satisfied when he told me with great warmth and
xzrdor, " 0 master, we save white mans from drown;" upon
which I immediately asked him, if there were any white

ans, as he called them, in the boat; " Yes, es," said
he, " the boat full, very full of' white mans." ow many,
Friday, said I. Hereupon he numbered his fingers, and
counted seventeen. And when I asked him what became
of them all, and whether they lived or not? he replied,
" Yes, master, they all live, they be live among my nation."
This information put fresh thoughts into my head, that these
must be the very men who before, I concluded, had been
swallowed up in the ocean, after they had left their ship
that had struck upon the rocks of my kingdom, and after
escaping the fury of the deep, landed upon the wild shore,

and committed themselves to the fury of the devouring
Indians.

The manner of their cruelties to one another, which coml t
l

 

106 LIPIi'. AX" ADVEN'I'UIIES 0P

sequently. as! thought, must be ueted with greater har-
harity to strangers, created in me a great anxiety. and made
me still more eurious to ask Friday concerning lhe 2. He
told me, he was sure they still lived there. having resided
among them above four years. and that the savages gave
them victuals to live upon. "at pray, Friday, said 1,
whenee proceeded all this good nature and generosity?
Ilou' e:une it to pass that they did not kill and eat them, to
pl 'ttst: their devouring appetites; and oeeasion so splendid
an entertainment among them? " No. no," said l'ridny.
" they not kill 'em, they make brother with 'elu; " by which
I understood there was a truee between them. And then 1
had a more favorable opinion of the Indians, upon Friday's
uttering the words: " My nation t'other nation no eat
mans but when mans make war tight: " as though he had
said, that neither those of his kingdom, nor any other nations
that he. knew of, ever ate their t'ellow-creatures, but such
as their law of arms allowed to be devoured: that is, those.
miserable eaptives' whose mislbrtuue. it should be to he made
prisoners ot'wat'.

Some considerable time after, upon a very pleasant day.
in most serene weather, my luau and I stood upon the top
ol'a hilL on the island, whence I had oneo betiire beheld
the continent of America. I could not tell immediately
what was the matter: for suddenly Friday fell a jumping
and dancing: as it' he had been mad; and upon my deniand'
ing the. reason of his behavior, " 0 joy," said he, "0
glad! there see my country, there my nation, there \vhito
mans gether." And indeed such a rapturous sense of
pleasure appeared in his eonnteuance, that his eyes had
an nneonnnou sparkling and brightness, and such a strango
eagerness, as il'he had a longing desire to be in his own
country again. This made me not so well satisfied with my
man Friday as before; for by this appearance, I made no
dispute, but that it' he could get back thither avain, he
would not only be unmindt'ul of what religion I had taught
him, but likewise of the great obligation'he owed me for
his wonderful deliverance; nay, that he would not only in-
torm his countrymen of me, but accompany hundreds of
them to my kingdom, and make me a miserable sacrifice,
like those unhappy wretches taken in battle.

Indeed I was very much to blame to have these cruel,
and unjust suspicious, and vmust freely own I wronged the
poor creature very much, who was of a quite contrary tem~
per. And had he had that discerning aecuteness which
many Europeans have, he would certainly have perceived
my coldness and indifl'erence, and also have been very much
concerned upon that account.

As we were walking up the same hill another day, when
the weather was so hazy at sea, that I could not perceive
the continent, Friday, said I, don't you wish yourself to be
in your own country, your own nation, among your old
friends and acquaintances? " Yes," said he, " me much
0 glad to be at my own nation." And what would you do
there, Friday? Would you turn wild again, eat man's flesh,
and be a savage as you were formerly? " No, no," (an-
swered he, full of concern, and shaking his head,) " Friday
now tell them to live good, tell them pray God, tell them
to eat corn, bread, cattle, flesh, milk, no eat man again."
But surely, replied I, if you should offer to do all this, they
will kill you; and to manifest their contempt of such in-
struction, eat you up when they have done. He then put
on a grave, yet innocent and smooth countenance, saying,
" No, they no kill me, they willing love learn:" that is,
that they would be very willing to learn: adding withal,
"that they had learned very much of the bearded mans'.__ _. . __, ,_ .. _'

that came in the boat." Will you, said I, go back again,
Friday? 3 lo smilcd at that, and told me, that he could not
swim so for. But, said 1, I will make a canoe for you:
" Yes, mastor," said ho, " mo go if you go, me. no go it"
you stay." lgo, Friday! why would you have lhvm out
me up, and devour your kind mastor? " No, no," said he,
" mo Inako them no out masti'r, and Iuo make them much
love you; " that is, llt' would tell thorn how I had slain his
cumulus, and tin-ruby saved his life, for which rotomu he
would make [ht-In Iovu mo: and than ho related to mt', as
wall as ho was nhlo, how vxcccding kind those of his na~
tion worn to tho whilo, or hearth-d mun, as he callt-d the-tn,
who in thoir grant calxnuity, wort- drivcu into their country.

It was from this time, indeed, lhad strong inclinations
to venturi- own and use my utmost vll'orts, it' possible, to
join with than white ln-anlod mun, who undoubtedly wore
Spaniards or l'ortugiu-so; for, thought .l, it must ho (tor-
lainly a butter and sut'or way, to escape when there is a
good company, than for me alone, from an island forty miles
otl'thc short'. and without any assistance. Some days after,
Friday and l [wing at work, as usual, at tho sumo tinu: di-
verting nursolvcs with various discoursos, l told him 1 had
a boat which I would lwstow upon him, whenover ho pleas-
e-d to return to his own nation: and to convince him of the
truth of what I said, 1 took him with me to tho othor side of
the island, where my frigate lay. and than taking it from
undor water, (for I alwu ~x kept it sunk for fear of a dis-
covery.) we both went into it to see how it would manage
such an expedition.

And roully never could any be more dexterous in rowing
than my faithful servant, making the. boat go as fast again
as I could. Well, now, Friday, said I, shall we now go to
your much desired nation? But, instead of meeting with
that cheertulness I expected, he looked very dull and mel-
ancholy at my saying so; which indeed at first surprised
me, till he made me sensible, that his concern was about
the boat's being too small to go so far a voyage. Upon
which, 1 let him understand I had a much bigger; and ac-
cordingly, the next day, went to the lace, where the first
bout in , which I had made, when al the strength I had,
or art could use, failed me in my attempt to get it into
the water: but now it having lain in the sun two and twenty
years, and no cure being taken of it all that while, it be--
came in a manner rotten. My man told me, that such a
boat would do very well for the purpose, sufficient to carry
" enough vittlo, dring, bread," for that was his manner of
talking. In short, my mind being strongly fixed, upon my
design of going over with him to the continent, I very
plainly told him, that we would both go and make a boat

full as big, and more proportionable than that, wherein he
might safely return to his own nation.

Go (your way, since you desire it, and leave me alone by
)

mysel as I was before I saved your life.

Never was any creature more thunderstruck than Friday
was at these words, " Go me away, leave master away,"
said he, alter a long silence, " No, no, Friday die, Friday
live not master gone; " as though he had said, I neither
can nor will live, if my master sends me from him. Friday
felt towards me the greatest gratitude, and the most sincere
love; he found me not only his deliverer, but his preserver
and comforter; not a severe and cruel tyrant, but a kind,
loving, and affable friend. He wanted for no manner of
sustenance; and when he was ill, or out of order, I was
his physician, not only for his body, but his soul; and
therefore no wonder was it, that such an innocent creature,
long since divested of his former natural cruelty, should
have an uncommon concern at so eruel a separation from
me. which pierced him to the. very soul, and made him dc-
sire even to die, rather thnn live without me.

After I had told l-'riday. in u very careless manner, that
he should be at his libertv as soon us the boat was made,
thelangunge of his '5 'xpressed all imaginnble. confusion;
when, immediately running to one of his hntehets, which
he used to wear as a defensive weapon, he gives it into my
hand. with a heart so full, that. he. could scarcely spunk.
Friday, said I. what is it you mean? \tht mu'st ldo with
this? " (lnly ltill Friday." said he, " Friday care not live
long." But "hat must I lull you for? replied I tigain.
" Ah, dear master, what made. you Friday snve from eat a
me up. so keep lung Friday. make lt'riduy love God. and
now l"rid:t_\' send away. never see Friday more." And while
he spoke thus. the tears ran down his cheeks in sneh a
plentiful nuinner. that I had much ado to refrain from
weeping also when l beheld the poor creature's allectiun:
so that l was tin-red to comfort him in the best manner
1 muld. \vltieh I did. by telling him, it' he was content to
ahide with me. I should be. ever willing to keep him.

Atier Friday's grief was somewhat abated. more fully to
convinee me of his all'eetion, he said, " 0 master, me not
care to be in my tuition. leave you bore. me. desire tuition
learn good. that 's all: " meaning, that his desire was for
the conversionofthnt barbarous people: and that he wished
tne to go with him. And indeed, I began to desire to go
also, from my late discourse with Friday, about these seven-
teen white bearded men. that had been driven upon the bar-
barian coast; whom I designed to join, as the only means
to further our escape. To which intent. my man and 1
went to search for a proper tree to fell, whereof we might
make a perigun or canoe. to undertake the voyage; and,ROBINSON AND FRIDAY JIL'ILD A CANOE TO CARRY THEM TO FRI-

indeed, we were not long in finding one fit for our purpose,
there being enough of wood in the island to have built a
lleet of large vessels, but the thing we principally wanted,
was, to get one so near the water, that we might launch it
alter it was finished, and not commit so horrid a mistake as
[ had done once before. Well, alter a great search for
what was best and most convenient, Friday, at last, whose
judgment in such ufl'airs was much superior to mine, pitches
upon a kind of wood the most fitting for it. But though
my man exceeded me in the knowledge of the most proper
tree, yet I showed him a much better and cleaner way to
make a canoe than ever he knew before; for he was for
burning the hollow or cavity of the tree, in order to make
this boat; but I then told him how we might do with tools,
teaching him at the same time how to use them, which
indeed he did very dexterously; so that in a month's time
we finished it, making it very handsome, by cutting the
outside in the true shape of a boat. Alter this, it took
us a full fortnight before we could get her into the water,
which we did, as it were, inch by inch, upon great rollers-
but when she was in, she would have carried twenty men,
with all the ease imaginable.

As I was very well pleased, you may be sure, at the
launching ofthis man of war of mine, I was no less amazed
to behold with what dexterity my man could manage her,
turn her, and paddle her along. Well, Friday, said I,
what do you think of it now? Do you think this will carry
us over? "Yes, master," said he, "we venture over
well, though great blow wind." But at design was yet
farther, which he was insensible of; an that to make a
mast and a sail, and provide her with an anchor and cable.
As to a mast, that was no difficult thing at all to procure:
so fixing upon a straight young cedar tree, which I found
near tbc place, (great plenty of it abounding In the island ,)
and setting Friday to cut it down, I gave. him particular

stunt application, that at last l accomplished my design;
but what with the many dull contrivanccs I had about it,
and the Iailurc of many thInIrs it cost me as much pains in
ordering as in making the. boat. Besides, when all this
was dl)l10,l had my mnn to teach whnt belonged to its
IIuIIigIItioIi, for though be very well understood how to
paddle a canoe alone, he was an utter stranger to a sail
and a rudder, and was amazed when he saw me work the
bout to and again in the sea, by them, and how the sail
jibbed and filled this way or that way, as the course we
sailed changed. After some time, and a little use, I made
all these things very familiar to him, so that he became an
expert sailor, except in relation to the compass, and that I
could make him understand but little of. But as it hap-
pened, there was seldom occasion for it, there being but
little cloudy weather, and scarcely any fog in those parts;
the stars were always visible in the night, and the shore
by day, except in the rainy season, which confined every
one to his habitation. Thus entered into the seven and
twentieth year of my reign or captivity, which you please,
(the last three of which, blessed with the company of my
man Friday, ought not to be reckoned,) lkept the anni-
versary of my landing here with the same thankfulness to
God for his tender mercies, as I did before; and certainly
as I had great cause for thankful acknowledgment for my
deliverance at first, I had much greater now for such sin-
gular and additional testimonies of the care of Providence
over me, in all my distreSSes of both body and mind, and
the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily
delivered; for I had a strong impression upon my min ,
that I should not be another year in this island. But,
however, I still continued on with my husbandry, digging,
planting, and fencing as usual: gathering and curing my
grapes, and doing'all other things that were necessary.
And now the rainy season beginning to come on, obliged
me to keep the longer within doors; but before this, I
brought my new vessel into the creek, where I had landed
my rafts, from the ship; so we waited for the months of
November and December. in which I designed to venture
over the ocean 8

terrii'y those that we do not kill; 1 am very willing to stand
by you to the last drop ol' my blood.

Now, tell me, Il'yon will do the like b me, and obey
my orders in whatsoever I command? firidny then an-
swcred, " 0 master, me lose litia for you, me die when you
bid die." Thus concluding all questions concerning his
tidelity, i ordered him to take the two fowling pieces,
which We always carried, and load them with large swan-
shot, as big as small pistol bullets; then I took four mus--
kets and loaded them with two sings, and live small bullets
cur-h; churgin my two pistols each with a brace, I hang
my great swor , as customary, uukcd to my side, and gave
Friday his hatchet, as a most excellent weapon for defence.

Thus prepared, 1 took my perspective glass, and went
up to the side ol'the hill, to see what I could discover; and
l perceived very soon, by my glass, that there were one
and twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes, and
their chief concern seemed to be the triumphant banquet
upon three poor human bodies, a thing \vhich'h this time
I had observed was very common with them. U'pon which
I called to Friday; and showing him a great tree, that was
just at the corner of the wood, near which they were, I
ordered him to repair thither, and bring me word, if he
could plainly perceive their actions; accordingly he did as
I commanded him, and came back with this melancholy
story, that they were all about their fire, eating the flesh
of one of their prisoners; and that another lay bound upon
the sand, a little distance from them, whom they designed
for their next sacrifice; and this he told me, was not one
of their nation, but one of those very bearded men, who
was driven by a storm into their country, and whom he had
so often spoken to me about. You may be sure, that.

1 only killod one and \\ oun1l1I1l two; but my man Friday,
taking his aim much better thnn I, killed two, and wounded
three. You may be sure they were in a dreadful con-
sternation, at such an unexpected disaster; and those who
had yet escaped our penetrating shot, immediately jum d
upon their t'eet,'hut were in such a confusion, that tiizy
knew not which way to run or look; not knowing from
whence their destruction came. We threw down our
pieces, and took up others, giving a second dreadful vol-
ley; but as they were only loaded with swan-shot or small
pistol bullets, we perceived only two of them full, though
many were Wounded, who ran yelling and screaming about
like mad creatures. Now, Friday, said I, lay down your
piece, and take up the musket, and follow me. He did so
with great courage, when showing ourselves to the sav-
ages, we gave a great shout, and made directly to the poor
victim, who would have been sacrificed, had not our first
tire obliged the butchers, with three others, to jump into
a canoe. By my order, Friday fired at them, at which
shot Ithought he had killed them all, by reason of their
falling to the bottom of the boat; however he killed two,
and mortally wounded a third. In the meantime I cut
the flags that tied the hands and feet of the poor creature,
and lifting him up, asked him in the Portu uese tongue,
What he was? he answered me In Latin, " hristianus' '
but so very weak and faint, that he could scarcely stand or
speak. And I next asked him, what countryman he was?
He said " Es )aniolu," and then uttered all the thankful-
ness imaginab e for his deliverance. Signior, (said I, with
as much Spanish as I was master of,) let us talk afierwards
but fight now; here, take this sword and pistol, and do what
on can. And indeed he did so with such courage and
mtrepidity, that he out two of them to pieces in an instant.
I ordered Friday to run for the guns we had left at the
tree, which he brought to me with great swiftaess, and
then I gave him my musket, while I loaded the rest. But
now there happened a fierce. encounter between the Span-
iard and one of the savages. who made at him with one of
their wooden swords; and though the former was as brave
as could he expected, having twice wounded his enemy in
the head; yet being: weak and faint, the Indian had thrown
him upon the ground, and was wresting my sword out of
his hand, which the Spaniard very wisely quilting, drew
out his pistol, and shot him through the body before I could
come near him, though I was running to his assistance.
As to Friday, he pursued the flying wretches with his
hatchet, dispatching three. but the rest were too nimble for
him. The Spaniard taking one. of the t'owliug pieces,
wounded two, who running into the wood, Friday pursued
and killed: but the other, notwithstanding his wounds,
plunged himself into the sea, and swam to those who were
let} in the canoe, which with one wounded, were all that
escaped out ot'one and twenty.

The savages in the canoe worked very hard to get out
of our reach, and Friday was as eager in pursuing them:
and, indeed, I was no less anxious about their escape, lest
after the news had been carried to their people, they
should return in multitudes, and destroy us. So being re-
solved to pursue them, I jumped into one of their canoes,
and bid Friday follow me; but no sooner was I in, than, to
my surprise, I found another poor creature, bound hand
and foot for the slaughter, just as the Spaniard had been,
with very little life in him. Immediately I unbound him,
and would have helped him up; but. he could neither stand
nor speak, but groaned so piteously, as thinking he was un-
bound in order to be slain. Hercupon I bid Friday speak
to him, and. tell him of his deliverance; when pulling out
my bottle, I made the poor wretch drink a. little, which,

_. _ "*4
With the joyful news he had received, so revived his heart,
that he sat up in the boat. As soon as Friday began to
hear him speak, and look more fully in his face, it would
have moved any one to tears to perceive his uncommon
transports of joy; for he kissed, embraced him, hugged
him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung,
then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his face and head,
then sung and jumped about again, like a distracted crea-
ture: so that it was a great while before I could make him
speak to me, or tell me what was the matter with him; but
when he came to the liberty of his speech, at last he told

me it was his father.

Herc, indeed, I was infinitely moved to see that dutiful
and tender affection this poor savage had to his aged parent.
He would sit down by him in the boat, open his breast,
and hold his father's head close to his bosom, half an hour
together, to cherish him: then he took his arms and ankles,
which were stiff and numbed, with binding, and chafed and
rubbed them with his hands; by which means, perceiving
what the case was, I gave him some rum, which proved of
great benefit to him.

While we were busy in this action, the savages had got--
ten almost out of sight; and happy it was we did not pursue
them: for there arose from the northwest, such a violent
storm, which continued all night long, that I could not sup-

ose otherwise but that they were all drowned. After this,

called Friday to me, and asked him, if he had given his
father any bread? He shook his head, and said, " None,
not one hit, me eat a up all;" so I gave him a cake of
bread out of a little pouch I carried for this end. I like-
wise gave him {two or three bunches of raisins for his
father.

Away he then runs out of the boat as if he was bewitched,120 LII-'8 no mvasrunns or

with such an extraordinary swil'tncss. that he was out of
sight as it were in an instant; but, at his return. I perceiv-
ed him slacken his pace, because he had something in his
hand. And this 1 found to be, as he approached nearer,
an earthen jug with some water for his father, witlt two
more cakes of bread, which he delivered into my hands.
Being very thirsty myself, l drank some of the water, of
which when his father had drank sufiieiently. it more reviv-
ed his spilits titan all the rutn I had given him.

I then called Friday to me, and ordered him to carry
one of the cakes, and some water to the Spaniard, who was
repesing himself upon a green place under tlte shade of a
tree, but. so weak, that though be exerted himself, he could
not stand upon his feet. Upon which, I ordered Friday to
rub and baths: his ankles with rum, as he did his father's.
But every minute lie was employed in this, he would cast
his eyes towards the boat, where. he left his father sitting;
who suddenly disappearing. he flow like lightning to him,
and finding he only laid himself down to ease his limbs, he
returned back to me presently, and then I spoke to the
Spaniard to let Friday help him, and lead him to the boat
in order to be conveyed to my dwelling, where I would take
care of him. Upon which, Friday took him upon his back,
and so carried him to the canoe, setting him close by his
father; and presently stepping out again, launched the boat
off, and paddled it along the shore. faster than I could walk,
though the wind blew very hard too; and having brought
them safe to the creek, away he runs to fetch the other
canoe, which he brought to the creek almost as soon as I
got to it by land; then wafting me over, he took our new
guests out of the boat; but so weak were they, that. I was
forced to make a kind of a hand-barrow; and when I came
to my castle, not being willing to make an entrance into121 l

ROBINSON CEUSOE.

my wall, we made them a handsome tent, covered with old
sails, and boughs of trees, making two good beds of rice
straw, with blankets to lie upon and cover them. Thus,
like an absolute king, over subjects who owed their lives
to me, I thought myself very considerable.

To get prthsions for my poor weak subjects, I ordered
Friday to kill me a yearling goat; which when he had done,
1 cut off the hinder quarters, and chopping it into small
pieces, boiled and stewed it, putting barley and rice into
the broth. This I carried into their tent, set a table, dined
with them, and encouraged them. Friday was my inter-
preter to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too, who
spoke the language of the savages pretty well. After din-
ner, I ordered Friday to fetch home all our arms from the
{ field of battle, and the next day to bury the dead bodies, 1
I which he did accordingly. And now I made Friday in-
quire of his father, whether he thought those savages had
escaped the late storm in their canoe, and if so, whether
they would not return with a force too great for as to re-
sist? He answered, that he thought it impossible they could
outlive the storm: or if they were driven southwardly, they
would come to a land where they would as certainly be 1
devoured, as if they were drowned in the sea. And sup- '
pose they had attained their own country, the strangeness
of their fatal and bloody attack would make them tell their
people that the rest of them were killed by thunder and
lightning, not by the hand of man, but by two heavenly
spirits (meaning Friday and me,) who were sent from above
to destroy them. And this, he said, he knew, because he
heard them say the same to one another. And indeed he
was in the right on't; for I have heard since, that these
lbur men gave out, that whoever went to that enchanted
island, would be destroyed by fire from the gods.1'22 I.IIIII. .INII AIH'IIIN'I'I'IIIIIS III-I

having boon smnII. lime with you I cannot but he sensible
that your stock of riCII and corn may be sumcient, perhups,
for us at present, but not for them, should they come over
presently, much less to victual a vessel for an intended
voyage. And therefore, my advice is, to wait another
harvest, and in the meantime, cultivate and improve some
more land, whereby we may have plenty of provisions, in
order to execute our design."

This advice of the Spaniard I approved extremely; and
so satisfied was I of his fidelity, that I esteemed him ever
after. And thus we all four went to work upon some more
land, and against seed-time, we had gotten so much cured
and trimmed up, as was sulficient to sow 22 bushels of bar-
ley on, and l6 jars of rice, which was in short all the seed
we had to spare. As we were four in number, and by this
time all in good health, we feared not an hundred of Indians,
should they venture to attack us; and while the corn was
growing, 1 pitched upon some trees, fit to build as a [or e
vessel, in case the Spaniards came over; which being mar -
ed, I ordered Friday and his father to cut them down, ap-
pointing the Spaniard, who was now my privy counsellor,
to oversee and direct the work. I likewise increased my
flocks of goats,'by shooting the wild dams, and bringing
home their kids to my enclosure; nor did I neglect the grape
season, but cured them as usual, though I had such a quan-
tity now, as would have filled 80 barrels with raisins.

And thus all of us being employed, they in working, and
Im providing for them, till harvest came, God Almighty
blessed the increase of it so much, that from twenty-two
bushels of barley, we thrashed out two hundred and twenty,
and the like quantity of rice, sufficient to victual a ship fit
to carry me and all the Spaniards to any part of America.

Thus the principal object being answered, by a sufficient
stock of provisions, I sent my two ambassadors over to the
main land, with a regal authority to administer the oaths of1'24 Lin: AND AIM'HN't't'tuzs t)!"

Not long it was, hvlhro l pvrct'iy't'tl the. hunt tu approach

might conveniently land; and at last tht'y ran tlivir boat on
the shore upon the beach, almut halfn mile distance; which
proved so much the llllpl)lt'l' for ma, since, had they come
into the creek, they had landed just at my door, and might
not only have forced me out of my castle, but plundered me
of all I had in the world. Now I was fully convinced they
Were all Englishmen, three of whom were unarmed and
bound; when immediately, the first four or five leaped on
shore, and took those three out of the boat as prisoners, one
of whom I could perceive used the most passionate gestures
ot'entroaty, affliction and despair, while the others in a less
dt'grcc showed abundance ol'concern.

Not knowing the meaning of this, I beckoned to Friday,
who was below, to ascend the mountain, and likewise view
this sight, " 0 master," said he to me, " you see English
mans eat prisoners as well as savage mans." And do you
think they will eat. them, Friday? said I. " Yes," said
Frid. y, " they eat a all up." No, no, said I, Friday, I am
much more concerned lest they murder them; but as for
eating them up, that I am sure they will never do.

And now I not only lamented my misfortune in not hav-
ing the Spaniard and Savage with me, but also that I could
not come within shot ofthem unperceived, (they having no
tire-arms among them,) and save these three men, whom
I thought they were going to kill with their swords. But
some comfort it was to me, that I perceived they were set
at liberty to go where they pleased, the rascally seamen
scattering about as though they had a mind to see the place;
and so long did they negligently ramble, that the tide had
ebbed so low, as to leave the boat aground. Nor were the
two men that were in her more circumspect: for having
drunk a little too much liquor, they fell fast asleep; but one
of them waking before the other, and perceiving the boat
too fast aground for his strength to move it, he hallooed out
to the rest, who made all possible expedition to come to
him; but as Providence ordered it, all their force was inef-
fectual to launch her, when I could hear them speak to one126 I.II'I-'. AND ,IIII'I-z

eagerly called for assistance; but the Captain (who had

came to the brow of the hill, near my ancient castle, fi'om
whence they could see to a great distance in the woods,
and there shouting and hallooing till tired and weary, they
at length seated themselves under a spreading tree. My
opinion was, that nothing could be done till night, when I
might use some artifice to get them all out of the boat; but
of a sudden they started up, and made towards the sea-side'
hereupon I ordered Friday and the Captain's mate to go
over the creek, and halloo as loud as they could, and so
decaying them into the woods, come round to me again.
And this, indeed, had good effect; for they followed the
noise, till coming westward to the creek, they called for
their boat to carry them over, and taking one of the men
out of her, left two to look after her, havin fastened her

I'lereupon im-
mediately the. Captain and our party passing the creek, out
of their sight, we surprised them both, by the Captain's
knocking down one and ordering the other to surrender
upon pain of death, and who being the honestest of them
all, sincerely joined with us. By this time it was pretty
late; when the rest returning to their boat, which they found
aground in the creek, the tide out, and the men gone, they
run about wringing their hands, crying it was an enchanted
island, and that they should be all murdered by spirits or
devils. My men would willingly have fallen upon them,
but I would not agree to hazard any of our party. But
to be more certain, Friday and the Captain crawled upon
their hands and feet, as near as possible; and when the
boatswain approached in sight, so eager was the Captain,

the next man, and a third ran away. IIereupon advanced
with my whole army; and it being dark, I ordered the man
we had surprised in the boat, to call them by their names,
