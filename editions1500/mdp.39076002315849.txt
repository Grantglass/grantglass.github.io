Robinson’s Family, etc.—-His Elopement from his Parents.

a foreigner of Bremen, named Kreutznaer, who settled

he had married my mother, whose relations were named
Robinson, a very good family in that country, and after
whom I was so called, that is to say, Robinson Kreutznaer;
but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we are
now called, nay, we call ourselves, and write our name,
Crusoe; and so my com anions always called me.
I had two elder brot ers, one of whom was lieutenant-
colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, former-
ly commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was
killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards.

competent share of learning, as far as house education and
a country free school generally go, and designed me for the
ROBINSON CRUSOB.

the will, nay, the commands of my father, and against all
the entreaties and persuasion of my mother and other
‘friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that
' propension of nature, tending directly to the life of misery

M father. '\ wise and grave man, gave me serious and
exce lent counsel against what he foresaw was my design.
He called me one morning into his chamber,‘where he was
contiried by the gout, and ex ostulated very warmly with
me upon this subject: he as ed me what reasons, more
shun a mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving his
douse, and my native country, where I might be well in-
srod used, and had a prospect of raising my fortune, by a -
olication and industry, With a life of ease and pleasure. Lib
told me it was men of desperate fortunes, on one hand, or
of superior fortunes, on t a other, who went abroad upon
> adventures, aspiring to rise by enterprise, and make them-
selves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the com-
. mon road; that these things were all either too far above
me, or too far below me; that mine was the middle state,
or what might be called the upper station of low life,
which he had found, by long experience, was the best state
in the world, the most suited to human hap iness; not ex-
osed to the miseries and hardships, the la )0!“ and suffer-
ings, of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embar-
rassed .with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the
upper part of mankind: he told me, 1 might judge of the
happiness of this state by one thing, viz., ‘ that this was the
state of life which all other people envied; that kings have
frequently lamented the miserable consequences of being
- born to great things, and wished they had been placed in
the middle of two extremes, between the niean and the
great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this as the
just standard of true felicity, when he prayed to have
“ neither poverty nor riches.”

the calamities of life were shared among the upper and
lower part of mankind; but that the middle station had
the fewest disasters, and was notexposed to so many vicis-
situdes as the higher or lower part of mankind: nay, they

ing, luxury, and extravagaucies, on one hand, or, by hard

on the other hand, bring distempers upon themselves by
the natural consequences of their way of living; that the
middle station of hie was calculated for all kind of virtues,
and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were
sosmsou causes. 1
the handmaids of a middle fortune; that temperance,
moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable diver-
sions, and all desirable pleasures were the blessings attend'
ing the middle station of life; that/this way men went
silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably
out of it, not embarrassed with the labors of the hands or
of the head, not sold to the life of slavery for daily bread,
or harassed with perplexed circumstances, which rob the
soul of peace, and the body of rest; not enraged with the
passion of envy, or secret burning lust of ambition for
great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently
through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets o! liv-
ing, without the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and
learning by every day’s experience to know it more
sensibly.
After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most
sosmsou causes. 1
precipitate myself into miseries which nature, and the
station of life I was born in, seemed to have provided
against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread;
that he would do well for me, and endeavor to enter me
fairly into the station of life which he had been just recom-
mending to me; and that if 1 was not very easy and happy
in the world, it must be my more fate, or fault, that must
hinder it; and that he should have nothing to answer for,
having thus discharged his duty in warning me against
measures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word,
that as he would do very kind things for me if I would stay
and settle at home as he directed, so he would not have so
much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encour--
agement to go away; and, to close all, he told me 1 had
my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the
same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the
Low Country wars; but could not prevail, his young de~
'sires prom ting him to run into the army, where he was
killed; an though, he said, he would not cease to pray for
me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take
this foolish step, God would not bless me; and I would

'his counsel, when there might be none to assist in my
recovery.
I observed, in this last part of his discourse, which was
truly prophetic, though, I. suppose, myjather did not know
it to be so himself; I say, I observed the tears run down
his face very plentifully, especially when he spoke of my
brother who was killed; and that, when he spoke of my
having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so
moved, that he broke off the discourse, and told me his
heart was so full he could say no more to me.
1 was sincerely affected with this discourse; as, indeed,
{who could be otherwise? and I resolved not to think of go-
ing abroad any more, but to settle at home, according to
my father’s desire. But alas! a few days were it all ed:

portunitios, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite
away from him. However, 1 did not act so hastily, neither,

mother, at a time when I thought her a little pleasanter
than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so on-
tirely bent upon seeing the world, that I should never settle
to anything with resolution enough to go through‘with it,
and my father had better give me his consent than force
me to go without it; that l was now eighteen years old,
which was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to
an attorney; that 1 was sure, if I did, I should never serve
out my time, and 1 should certainly run away from my
master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she
would speak to my father to let me make but one voyage
abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, I would
go no mere; and I would promise by a double diligence, to
recover the time I had lost. , y
This put my mother into a great passion; she told me
she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father
upon any such a subject; that he knew toowell what was
my interest to give his consent to anything so much for my
hurt; and that she wondered how could think of any
such thing, after such a discourse as I had from my father,
and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my
father had used to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin
myself, there was no help for me; but I might depend]

she would not have so much hand in my destruction; and
I should never have itto say that my mother was willing

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet,

him; and that my father, after showing a great concern at
it, said to her with a sigh, That boy might be happy if he
would stay at home; but if he goes abroad, he will be the
most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give no
consent to it.
It was not till almost a year after this tha‘ I broke loose;
though in the meantime I continued obstinately deaf to all
proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulat-
ing with my father and mother about their being so posi-
tively determined against what they knew my inclinations
prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, whither I
went casually, and without any purpose of making an
elopement at that time, and one of my companions then
going to London by sea in his father’s ship, and prompting
me to go with them by the common allurement of seafar-
ing men, viz., that it should cost me nothing for my pass-
age, I consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor
so much as sent them word of it; but left them to hear of
it as they might, without asking God’s blessing, or my
father’s, without any consideration of circumstances or
consequences, and in an ill hour, God knows;

SECTION 11.
First Adventures at Sea, and Experience of s Maritime Life—Voy-
age to Guinea. -
ON the 1st of September, 1651, I went on board a ship
bound for London. Never any young adventurer’s mis-
fortunes, I believe, began younger, or continued longer,
than mine. The ship had no sooner got out of the Hum-
ber, than the wind began to blow, and the waves to rise,
in a most frightful manner; and as I had never been at sea

done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of
Heaven for wickedly leaving my father’s house. All the
good eounsels of my parents, my father’s tears, and my
mother’s entreaties, came new fresh into my mind; and
my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of
hardness to which it has been since, reproaohed me with
the contempt of advice and the abandonment of my dut .
All this while the storm increased, and the sea, whi I
/
had never been upon before, went veryr high, though noth-
ing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor what
I saw a few days after; but, such as it Was, enough to
affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and had never
known anything Qf the matter. 1 expected every wave
wnuld have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship
fell down, as I thought, in the trough or hollow of the sea,
" we should never rise more; and in this agony of mind I
made many vows and resolutions, that if it would please
God to spare my life this voyage, if ever 1 got my foot once
on dry land, I would go directly home to my father, and
never set it into a ship again while I lived; that I would
take his advice, and never run myself into such miseries as
these any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of his
observations about the middle station of life; how easy,
how comfortable, he had lived all his days, and never had
been exposed to tempests at sea or troubles on shore; and
I resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go
home to my father.
These . wise and sober thoughts continued during the
storm, and indeed some time after; but the next day, as
the wind was abated, and the sea calmer, I began to be a
little inured to it. However, I was very grave that day,
being also a little sea-sick still; but toward night the

no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining u on it, the
sight was, as I thought, the most delightful t at I ever
saw.
1 had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-
sick. but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea
that was so rough and terrible the day before, and could be
so calm and pleasant in a little time after.
,And now, lest my good resolutions should continue, my
companion, who had indeed enticed me away, came to me,
and said, Well, Bob, clapping me on the shoulder, how do
you do after it? I warrant you you were frightened,
wa’n’t you, last night, when it blew but a capful of wind?
——A capful, do you call it? said I; ’twas a terrible storm.
—A storm, you fool! replies he, do you call that a storm?
Why, ’it was nothing at all; give us but a good ship, and
sea-room, and we think nothing of such a squall of wind as

make a bowl of punch, and we’ll forget all that. D’ye see
what charming weather he now? To make short this sad
part of my story, we went the way of all sailors; the punch
was made, and I was made drunk with it; add in that one
night’s wickedness i drowned all my repentance, all my re-
flections upon my past conduct, and all my resolutions for
the future. In a word, as the sea was returned to its
smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the abate-
ment of the storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being
over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by
the sea forgotten, and the current of my former desires re-
turned, I entirely forgot'the vows and promises I had made

tion; and serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavor to re-
turn again sometimes; but I shook them off and reused
myself from them, as it were from a distemper, and, ap-
plying myseli to drink and company, soon mastered the

young sinner, that resolved not to be troubled with it,
could desire. But 1 was to have another trial for it still;
and Providence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved
to leave me entirely without excuse: for if I would not take
this for a deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the
worst and most hardened wretch among us would confess
both the danger and the mercy of. The sixth day of our
being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind hav-
ing been contrary and the weather calm, We had made but
little way since the storm. Here we were obliged to come
to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing con-
trary, viz., at south-west, for seven or eight days, during
which time a great many ships from Newcastle came into
the same roads, as the common harbor where the ships
might wait for a wind for the River Thames. We had not,
however, rid here so long, but we should have tided up the
river, but that the wind blew too fresh; and, after we had

earned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but
spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the
sea. But the eighth day, in pigs. mgrning, the wind‘ in-
creased, and we had all hands at work to trike our top-
masts, and make everything snug and close, that the ship
might ride as easy as possible. ' By noon the sea went very
high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle in, shipped several
seas, and we thought, once or twice, our anchor had come
home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet
anchor; so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the
cables veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I
began to see terror and amazement in the faces of even the
seamen themselves. The master was vigilant in the busi-
ness of preserving the shi ; but, as he went in and out of
his cabin by me, I coul hear him softly say to himself
several times, Lord, be merciful to us! we shall be all lost;

himself came by me, as I said just now, and said we should
be all lost, I was dreadfully frightened. I got .up out of
my cabin, and looked out; but such a dismal sight 1 never
saw; the sea went mountains high, and broke u on us
every three or four minutes. When I could look 8 out, I
could see nothing but distress around us; two ships, that
rid near us, we found had cut their masts by the board,
being deeply laden; and our men cried out that a ship
which rid abOut a mile ahead of us was foundered. Two
more ships, being driven from their anchors, were run out
of the roads to sea, at all adventures, and that with not a
mast standing. The light ships fared the best, as not so
much laboring in the sea; but two or three of them drove,
and came close by us, running away, with only their sprit-
sails out, before the wind. Toward evening, the mate and
boatswain begged the master of our ship to let them cut
away the foremast, which he was very loath to do; but the
boatswain protesting to him, that if he did not, the ship
would founder, he consented; and when they had cut away
the foremast, the mainmast stood so loose, and shook the
ship so much, they were obliged to cut it away also, and
make a clear deck.
Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all
this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such
a fright before at but a little. But if I can express, at this
distance, the thoughts 1 had about me at that time, I was
in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former
convictions, and the having returned from them to the res-

itself; and these, added to the terror of the storm, put me
into such a condition that I can by no words describe it.
But the worst Was not come yet ; the storm continued with
such fury that the seamen themselves acknowledged they
had never known a worse. We had a good ship, but she
was deep laden, and so wallowed in the sea, that the sea-
men every now and then cried out she would founder. It
was my advantage, in one respect that 1 did not know what
they meant by founder, till I inquired. However, the
storm was so violent that 1 saw, what is not often seen, the
master, the boatswain, and some others, more sensible than
the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every moment the
chi would go to the bottom. 1n the middle of the night,
an under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men,
that had been down on purpose to see, cried out, we had
a rung a leak; another said there was four feet of water in
t e hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At
that ver word my heart, as I thought, died within me,
and 1 fe backward upon the side of my bed, where I sat
in the cabin. However, the men roued me, and told me
that I, who was able to do nothing before, was as well able
to pump as another: at which 1 stirred up and went to the
pump, and worked very heartily. While this was doing,

out the storm, were obliged to slip and run away to sea,

signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what that meant,
was so surprised, that I thought the ship had broke, or
some dreadful thing had happened. In a word, I was so
surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time
when everybody had his own life to think of, no one mind-
ed me, or what was become of me: but another man
stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his
foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead; and it was a
t while before I came to myself.

was apparent that the ship would founder; and though the

‘rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us.
It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us, but
it was impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to
lie near the ship’s side; till at last the men rowing Very
heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our men
cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, and then
veered it out a great length, which they, after great labor
and hazard, took hold. of, and we hauled them close under
our stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no pur-
pose for them or us, after we were in the boat, to think of
reaching their own ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and
only to pull her in toward shore as much as we could; and
our master promised them, that if the boat was staved
upon shore, he would make it good to their master; so,
partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went away to
the northward, sloping toward the shore almost as far as
Winterton-Ness. '
We were not ‘mueh more than a quarter of an hour out
of our ship when we saw her sink; and then I understood,

1up when the seamen told me she was sinking; for, from
that moment, they rather put me into the boat, than that
1 might be said to go in. My heart was, as it were, dead
' within me, partly with fright, partly with horror of mind,
and the thoughts of what was yet beiore me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet laboring at
the oar to bring the boat near the shore, we could see
(when, our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see
the shore) a great many people running along the strand,
to assist us when we should come near; but we made slow
way toward the shore; nor were we able to reach it, till.
being past the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls off
to the westward, toward Cromer, and so the land broke 011
a little the violence of the wind. Here we got in, and,
though not without much difficulty, got all safe on shore,
and walked afterward on foot to Yarmouth; where, as un-
fortunate men, we were used with great humanity, as well
by the magistrates of the town, who assigned as good
uarterl, as by the particular merchants and owners of

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and
have gone home, I had been happy: and my father, an
emblem of our blessed Saviour’s parable, had even killed
the fatted calf for me; for, hearing the ship I went in was
"cast away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before
{ he had any assurance that I was not drowned. \
I But my ill fate pushed me on with an obstinacy that
nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud
calls from my reason, and my more composed judgment,
to go home, yet I had no power to do it.—l know not what
.to call this, nor willI urge that it is a secret, overruling
decree, that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own
destruction, even though it be before us, and that We rush
upon it with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some
such decreed unavoidable misery attending, and which it
was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed me
forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my
most retired thoughts, and against two such visible instruc-

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and
who was the master’s son, was now less forward than I;

me, it ap ared his tone was altered, and, looking very
melaneho y, and shaking his head, he asked me how I did;
telling his father who I was, and how I had come this voy-
3lge only for a trial, in order to go further abroad. His
lather, turning to me, with a grave and concerned tone,
,Young man, says be, you ought never to go to sea any
lmore; you ought to take this for a plain and visible token,
' that you are not to be a seafaring man. —-Why, sir? said I ;
will you go to sea no moreP—That is another case, said he;
it is my calling, and therefore my duty; but as you made
this voyage for a trial, you see what a taste Heaven has
given you of what you are to expect if you persist. Per-
aps this has all befallen us on your account, like Jonah in
the ship of Tarshish.-Pray, continues he, what are you,
and on what account did you go to sea? U on that I told
him some of my Astg'yi "at the_end_o£ whic he burst out
with a strange kind of passion. What had I done, said he,
that such an unhappy wreteh should come into my ship?
I would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again
for a thousand pounds. This indeed was, as 1 said, an ex-
cursion of his spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense
of his loss, and was further than he could have authority
to go.——However, he afterward talked very gravely to me;
exhorted me to go back to my father, and not tempt Provi-
dence to my ruin; told me, I might see a visible hand of
Heaven against me; and, young man, saidhe, depend upon
it, if you do not go back, wherever you go, you will meet
with nothing but disasters and disappointments, till your

We parted soon after, for 1 made him little answer, an
I saw him no more; which way he went, I know not; as
for me, having some money in my pocket, I traveled to
London by land; and there, as well as on the road, had
many strug les with myself what course of life I should
take, and whether I should go home or go to sea. As to
going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered
to my thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me how I
should be laughed at among the neighbors, and should be
ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even
everybody else. From whence I have often since observed,
how incongruous and irrational the common temper of
mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason which ought
to guide them in such cases, viz., that they are not
ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not
ashamed of the action, for which they ought justly to be
esteemed fools; but are ashamed of the returning, which
only can make them be esteemed wise men.
In this state of life, however, I remained some time, un-
certain what measures to take, and what course of life to
lead. An irresistible reluctance continued to going home;
and as I stayed awhile, the remembrance of the distress I
had been in wore off; and as that abated, the little motion
1 had in my desires to a return wore off with it, till at last
- I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a

coast of Guinea, and who, havingi ad very good success
there, was resolved to go again. 6, taking a fancy to my
conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at that
time, and hearing me say I had a mind to see the world,
told me that if I would go the voyage with him, I should
be at no expense; 1 should be his messmate and his com-
anion; and if 1 could carry anything with me, 1 should
ave all the advantage of it that the trade would admit,
and perhaps I might meet with some encouragement. I
embraced the offer, and entering into a strict friendship
with this captain, who was an honest and plain-dealing
man, 1 went the voyage with him and carried a small ad-
venture with me, which, by the disinterested honesty of
my friend the captain, I increased very considerably; for 1

I WAS now set up for a Guinea trader, and my friend,
to my great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I re-
solved to go the same voyage again, and I embarked in the
same vessel with one who was his mate in the former voy-
age, and had now got the command of the ship. This was
the unhappiest voyage that ever man made; for though I
did not carry quite a hundred pounds of my new-gained
wealth, so that I had two hundred pounds left, and which
I lodged with my friend’s widow, who was very just to me,

immediately fell to cutting and hacking the sails and rig-

However, to cut short this melancholy part of our story, ‘

Heaven had overtaken me, and I Was undone, without re-
demption. But, alas! this was but a taste of the misery I
was to go through, as will appear in the sequel of this
story.
As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his
house, so I was in hopes he would take me with him when
he went to sea again, believing that it would, some time or
other, be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese
man-of-war, and that thenI should be set at liberty. But
this hope of mine was soon taken away, for when he went
to sea he left me on shore to look after his little garden, and
do the common drudgery of slaves about his house, and when
he came home again from his cruise, he ordered‘me to lie
in the cabin, to look after the ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what

had the least probability in it. Nothing presented to
make the supposition of it rational; for I had nobody to
communicate it to that would embark with me, no fellow-
slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or Seotchman there but
myself; so that for two years, though I often pleased my-
self with the imagination, yet I never had the least encour-
aging prospect of putting it in practice.
After about two years, an odd circumstance presented
itself, which put the 01d thought of making some attempt
for my liberty again in my head. My patron lying at

calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we were
not half a league from the shore, we lost sight of it; and
rowing, we knew not whither, or which way, we labored
all day and all the next night, and when the morning
came, we found we had pulled off to sea, instead of pull-
ing in for the shore, and that we were at least two leagues
from the shore; however, we get well in again, though
with a great deal of labor, and some danger, for the wind
began to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but particular-
1y we were all very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take
more care of himself for the future; and having lying by
him the long-boat of our English ship he had taken, he re-
solved he would not go a-fishing any more without a com-
pass and some provision; so he ordered the carpenter of
the ship, who was an English slave, to build a little state-
room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat, like that of a
barge, with a place to stand behind it, to steer and haul
home the main sheet, and room before for a hand or two
to stand and work the sails. She sailed with what we-
ealled a shoulder-of-mutton sail, and the boom jibed

for I told him we must not presume to eat of our patron ’s

lump of beeswax into the boat, which weighed show halt
a hundredweight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a
hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which were of great use
to us afterward, especially the wax, to make candles. An-
other trick I tried upon him, which he innocently came
into also; his name was Ismael, whom they call Muley, or
Moley; so I called to him. Moley, said 1, our patron’s guns
are on board the boat; can you not get a little powder and
shot? it may be we may kill some alcamies (fowls like our
curlews) for ourselves, for 1 know he keeps the gunner’r

accordingly he brought a great leather pouch, which held

that he might not see them, I said to the Moor: This Wlll

the head of the boat, set the sails; and as I had the helm,

stepped forward to where the Moor was, and I took him .
by surprise, with my arm under his waist, and tossed him
clear overboard into the sea. He rose immediately, for he
swam like a cork, and called to me, begged to be taken in,
and told me he would go all the world over with me. He
swam so strong after the boat, that he would have reached
me very quickly, there being but little wind; upon which
\
I stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-
pieces, I presented it at him, and told him I had done him
no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would do him none.
'J/But, said I, you swim well enough to reach the shore, and
the sea is calm; make the best of yOur way to shore, and I
' will do you no harm; but if you come near the boat I will
shoot you through the head; for I am resolved to have my
liberty. So he turned himself about, and swam for the
shore, and 1 make no doubt but he reached it with ease,
for he was an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor with
me and have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing
to trust him; When he was gone I turned to the boy,
whom they called Xury, and said to him: Xury, if you
will be faithful to me I will make you a great man; but if
you will not stroke your face to be true to me (that is,
swear by Mahomet and his father’s beard), I must throw
you into the sea too. The boy smiled in my face, and
spoke so innocently, that I could not mistrust him, and
swore to'be faithful to me and go all over the world with
me. ‘
While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I
stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching“ to
windward, that they might think me gone toward the
strait’s mouth (as indeed any one that had been in their
wits must have been supposed to do); for who would have
supposed we were sailing on to the southward, to the truly
Barbarian coast, where whole nations of negroes were sure
to surround us with their canoes and destroy us; where we
could never once go on shore but we should be devoured
£y savage beasts, or more merciless savages of human
in .
But as seen as it grew dusk in the evening I changed my
course, and steered directly south and by east, bending my
course a little toward the east, that I might keep in with
the shore; and having a fair, fresh gale of wind, and a
smooth, quiet sea, I made such sail that I believe by the
next day, at three o’clock in the aiternoon, when I made

ward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels were in
chase of me, they also would now give over; so I ventured
to make to the coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth
of a little river; I knew not what or where, neither what
latitude, what country, what nation, or what river. I
neither saw, nor desired to see, any people; the rincipal
thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek
in the evening, revolving to swim on shore as soon as it was
dark, and discovet .he country; but as soon as it was quite
dark we heard such dreadful noises of the barking, roar-
ing, and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not what
kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and
begged of me not to' go on shore till day. Well, Xury,
said I, then I will not; but it may be we may see men by
day, who will be as bad to us as those lions. Then we may
give them the shoot-gun, says Xury, laughing; make
them run away. Such English Xury spoke by conversing
among us slaves. However, 1 was glad to see the boy so
cheerful, and I gave him a dram out of our patron’s case
of bottles to cheer him up. After all, Xury’s advice was
good, and I took it. We dropped Our little anchor, and
lay still all night; 1 say still, for we slept none; for in two
or three hours we saw vast creatures (we knew not what to
call them), of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore, and
run into the water, wallowing and washing themselves, for
the pleasure of cooling themselves, and they made such
hideous howlings and yellings, that I never indeed heard
the like.
Xury was dreadfully fri htened, and indeed so was I too;
but We were both ‘more rightened when we heard one of
these mighty creatures swimming toward our boat; we
could not see him, but we might hear him, by his blowing,
to be a monstrous, huge, and furious beast. Xury said it
was a lion, and it might be so, for aught I know; but poor
Xury cried to me to weigh the anchor and row away. No,
says I, Xury; we can slip our cable with a buoy to it. and
go off to sea; they can not follow us far. I had no sooner
said so, but 1 perceived the creature (whatever it was)
within two oars’ length, which something surprised me;

however, 1 immediately stepped to the cabin door, and

atelv turned about, and swam to the shore again.
But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises and
hideous'cries and howlings that were raised, as well upon
the edge of the shore as higher within the country, upon
the noise! or report of the an; a thing, I believe, those
creatures had never 'heard efore. This convinced me
there was no going on shore for us in the night upon that
coast; and how to venture on shore in the day, was another
question too; for to have fallen into tbehands of any of
the savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into the
awe of lions and tigers; at least, we were equally appre-
ensive of the danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore
somewhere or other for water, for we had not a pint left in
the boat; when and where to get it was the point. Xury
said if I would let him go on shore with one of the jars, he-
ROBINSON causes. 25
I asked him why he would go, why I should not go, and he
stay in the boat. The boy answered with so much affec-
tion that he made me love him ever after. Says he, 11
wild mans come, they eat me, you go away. Well, Xury,
said I, we Wlll both go; and if the wild mans come, we
will kill them; they shall eat neither of us. So I gave
Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat and a dram out of our
patron’s case of bottles, which I mentioned before; and we
auled in the boat as near the shore as we thought was
proper, and so waded to shore, carrying nothing but our
arms, and two jars for water.
_ I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the
, coming of canoes with savages down the river; but the
boy, seeing a low place about a mile up the country, ram~
bled 'to it; and by and by 1 saw him come running toward
me. I thought he was pursued by some savage, or fright
ened by some wild beast, and 1 therefore ran forwaru to
help him; but when I came nearer to him, I saw some-
thing hanging over his shoulders, which was a creature
that he had shot, like a hare, but different in color, and
longer legs; however, we were very glad of it, and it was
very good meat; but the great joy that poor Xury came
with was to tell me he had found good water and seen no
wild mans. ~
But we found afterward that we need not take such pains
for water; for a little higher up the‘creek where we were,
we found the water fresh when the tide was out, which

latitude we were in, and did not exactly know, or at least
remember, what latitude they were in, I knew not where
to look for them, or when to stand off to sea toward them,
otherwise I might now have easily found some of these
islands. But my hope was that if I stood along this coast -

that would relieve and take us in.
By the best of my calculation, the place where I now
was, must be that country which, lying between the Em-
peror of Morocco’s dominions and the Negroes, lies waste
and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the Negroes hav-
ing abandoned it, and gone further south, for fear of the
Moors, and the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by
reason of its barrenness; and, indeed both forsaking it be-
cause of the prodigious number of tigers, lions, leopards,
and other furious creatures which harbor there, so that the
Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go like an
army, two or three thousand men at a time; and, indeed,
for near a hundred miles together upon this coast, we saw
nothing but a waste, uninhabited country by day, and
heard nothing but howlings and roaring of wild beasts by
ni ht.
gOnce or twice, in the day-time, I thought I saw the P100
of Tenerilie, being the top of the mountain of Teneritl‘e,
in the Canaries, and had a great mind to venture out, in
hopes of reaching thither; but having tried twice, I was

design, and keep along the shore.
Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after
we had left this place; and once, in particular, being early
in the morning, we came to an anchor under a little point
of land which was pretty high; and the tide beginning to

more about him than, it seems, mine were, calls softly to

inted, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was a
terrible great lion, that lay on the side of the shore, under
the shade of a piece of the hill, that hung, as it were, over
him. Xury, says I, you shall go on shore and kill him.
Xury looked frightened, and said, Me kill! he eat me at
one mouth; one mouthful he meant. However, I said no
more to the boy, but bade him be still; and I took our
biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and loaded it
with a good charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid
' it down; then I loaded another gun with tW0 bullets; and

again and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to
see him drop, and make but little noise, but lie struggling
for life. Then Xury took heart, and would have me let
him go on shore. Well, go, said I; so the boy jumped
into the water, and taking a little gunin one hand, swam
to shore with the other hand, and coming close to the creat-
ure, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him in
the head again, which dispatched him quite. ‘
This was game, indeed, to us, but it was no food; and l
was very sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot
upon a creature that was good for nothing to us. How-
ever, Xury said he would have some of him; so he comes
on board, 'and asked me to give him the hatchet: For
what, Xury? said I. Me out 01f his head, said he. How-
ever, Xury could not cut oil his head; but he cut off a
bot, and brought it with,_him,' and it was a monstrous
great one. I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the
skin of him might one way or other, be of some value to
us; and I resolved to take elf his skin, if I could. So
Xury and I went to work with him: but Xury was much
the better workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it.
Indeed, it took us both up the whole day; but at last we
got oif the hide of him, and spreading it on the top of our
cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two days’ time, and it
afterward served me to lie upon.
After this stop we made on to the southward continual-
ly, for ten or twelve days, living very sparingly on our
provisions, which began to abate very much, and going no
oftener into the shore than we were obliged to for fresh,
water. My design in this, was to make the River Gambia,
or Senegal: that is to say, anywhere about the Cape de
Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some European
. ship; and if I did not, I knew not what course I had to
take, but to seek for the islands or perish among the
Negroes. I knew that all the ships from Europe, which
sailed either to the coast of Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the
East Indies, made this Cape, or these islands: and in a
word I put the whole of'my fortune upon this single
point, either that I must meet with some ship, or must
erish. .
When I had pursued this resolution about ten days
longer, as I have said, I began to see that the land was in-
habited; and in two or three places, as we sailed by, we
saw people stand upon the shore to look at us: we could
also perceive they were quite black and stark naked. I was
once inclined to have gone on shore to them; but Xury
was my better counselor, and said to me: No go, no go. *
However, I hauled in nearer the shore, that I might talk
to them; and I found they ran along the shore by me a
good way. I observed they had no weapons in their hands,
except one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury said
‘was a lance, and that they would throw them a great way
with good aim; so I kept at a distance, but talked to them
by signs, as well as 1 could, and particularly made signs
for something to eat. They beckoned to me to stop my
boat, and they would fetch me some meat: upon this I
lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and two of them
ran a into the country; and in less than half an hour

could not tell, any more than we could tell whether it was

most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and
those the islands, called, from thence, Cape de Verd
Islands. However, they were at a great distance, and I
could not well tell what I had best to do; for if 1 should
be taken with a gale of wind, I might neither reach one
nor the other.
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into
the cabin, and eat me down, Xury having the helm; when,
on a sudden, the boy cried out, master, master, a ship with
a sail! and the foolish boy was frightened out of his wits,
thinking it mut needs be some of his master’s ships sent
to pursue us, when I knew we were got far enough out of
their reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately
saw, not only the ship, but what she was, viz., that it was
a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound to the
coast of Guinea, for Negroes. But, when I observed the
course she steered, I was soon convinced they were bound
some other way, and did not design to come any nearer to
the shore; upon which, Lstretched out to sea as much as I
could, resolvrng to speak with them, if possible.
With all the sail I could make, 1 found I should not be
able to come in their way, but that they would be gone by
before I could make any signal to them; but after I had
crowded to the utmost, and began _to despair, they, it
seems, saw me, by the help of their perspective glasses,
vand that it was some European boat, which, they sup-
posed, must belong to some ship that was lost: so they
shortened sail, to let me come up. I was encouraged with
this, and as 1 had my patron’s ensign on board, I made a

both which they saw; for they told me they saw the smoke,
though they did not hear the gun. Upon these signals,
they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me; and in
about three hours’ time I came up With them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in
Spanish, and in French, but I understood none of them;
but, at last, a Scotch sailor who was on board, called to.
me, and I answered him, and told him I was an English-l
man, that 1 had made my escape out of slaver from the]
Moors, at Sallee: they then bade me come on board, and
very kindly took me in, and all my goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will
believe, that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from
such a miserable, and almost hopeless, condition as 1 was
in; and I immediately offered all 1 had to the captain of
the ship, as a return for my deliverance; but he generously
told me, he would take nothing from me, but that all I
had should be delivered safe to me,ywhen 1 came tothe
Brazils. For, says he, I have saved your life on no other
terms than I would be glad to be saved myself; and it
may, one time or other, be m lot to be taken up in the
same condition. Besides, said lie, when I carry you to the
Brazils, so great a way from your own country, if 1 should
take from you what you have, you will be starved there,
and then I only take away that life 1 had iven. No, no,
Senhor lngles (Mr. Englishman), says he, I will carry you
thither in charity, and these things will help to buy your
subsistence there, and your passage home again. .

took everything into his own possession, and gave me back
an exact inventory of them, that I might have them, even
so much as, my three earthen jars.
As to my boat, it was a very good one; and that he saw,
and told me he would buy it of me for the shi ’s use; and
asked me what 1 would have for it? I told im, he had
been so generous to me in everything, that 1 could not
offer to make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to
him: upon which, he told me he would give me a note of
hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil; and

eight more for my boy Xury, which 1 was loath to take;
not that 1 was not willing-t0 let the ca tain have him, but
I was very loath to sell the poor boy’s iberty, who had as-
sisted me so faithfully in procuring my own. However,
when I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just,
and offered me this medium, that he would give the boy an
obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned Christ-
ian; upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to
him, I left the captain have him.
We had a ver good voyasge to the Brazils, and arrived
in the Bay de odos 10s autos, or All Saints’ Bay, in
¢
about twenty-two days after. And now 1 was once more
delivered from the most miserable of all conditions of life;
and what to do next with myself, I was now to consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never
enough remember: he would take nothing of me for my
passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leupard’s skin, and
forty for the lion’s skin, which I had in my boat, and
caused everything I had in the ship to be punctually de-
livered to me; and what I was willing to sell, he bought of
me; such as the case .of bottles, two of my guns, and a
piece of the lump of hees-wax—for I had made candles of
the‘rest: in a word, 1 made about two hundred and twenty
pieces of eight of all my cargo; and with this stock, I went
on shore in the Brazils. “
I had not been long here, before I was recommended to
the house of a good honest man, like himself, who had an
ingenio as they call it (that is, a plantation and a sugar
house). I lived with him some time, and acquainted my
self, by that means, with the manner of planting and of
making sugar; and seeing how well the planters lived, and
how they got rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could get a
license to settle there, I would turn planter among them:
nosmsou causes. 33
my money, which I had left in London, remitted to me.
To this purpose, getting a kind of letter of naturalization,
I purchased as much land that was uncured as my money
would reach, and formed a plan for my plantation and
settlement: such a one as might be suitable to the stock
which 1 proposed to myself to receive from England. /
1 had a neighbor, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born of
English parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such
circumstances as I was. I call him my neighbor, because
his plantation lay next to mine, and we went on very soci—
ably together. My stock was but low, as well as his; and
we rather planted for food than anything else, for about two
years. However, we began to increase, and our land he-
gan to come into order; so that the third year we planted
some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground
ready for planting canes in the year to come; but we both
wanted help; and now 1 found more than before, I had
done wrong in parting with my boy Xury.
But, alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right, was
no great wopder. I had no remedy, but to go on: I had

0t into an employment quite remote to my genius, and
irectly contrary to the life I delighted in, and for which 1
iorsook my father’s house, and broke through all his good
advice: nay, I was coming into the very middle station, or
upper degree of lower life, which my father advised me to
before; and which, if I resolved to go on with, I might as
well have stayed at home, and never have fatigued myself
in the world, as 1 had done; and I used often to say to my@
self, I could have done this as well in England, among my
3t
strangers and savages, in a wilderness, and at such a dist~
ance as never to hear from any part 01 the world that had
the least knowledge of me.
In this manner, I used to look upon my condition with
the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with, but
now and then this neighbor; no work to be done, but by
the labor of my hands: and 1 used to say, I lived just like
a man cast away upon some desolate island, that had no-
body there but himself. But how just has it beenl and
3t
present conditions with others that are worse, Heaven may
oblige them to make the exchange, and be convinced of
their former felicity by their experience: 1 say, how just
3t
island of mere desolation, should be my lot, who had so
often unjustly compared it with the life which I then led,
in which, had 1 continued, I had, in all probability, been
exceeding prosperous and rich! .
1 was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carry—
ing on the plantation, before my kind friend, the captain
of the ship that took me up at sea, went back; for the ship
remained there, in providing his lading, and preparing
for his voyage, near three months; when telling him what
little stock had left behind me in London, he gave me
this iriendly and sincere advice: Senhor lnglez, says be
(for so he always called me), it you will give me letters,
and a procuration here in form to me, with orders to the
person who has your money in London, to send your effects
to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in such
goods as are proper for this country, 1 will bring you the
produce of them, God willing, at my return: but since hu-
3t
have you give orders for but one hundred pounds sterling,
which, you say, is half your stock, and let the hazard] be

rest the same way; and, if it miscarry, y0u may have the
other half to have recourse to for your su ply. This was
so Wholesome advice, and looked so frien ly, that I could
not but be convinced it was the best course I could take;
so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman with
whom I left my money, and a procuration to the Portu~
guese captain, as he desired me.
I wrote the English captain’s widow a full account of
all my advénthres; my slayery, escape, and how I had met
with the Portuguese captain at sea, the humanity of his be-
havior, and what condition 1 was now in, with all other
necessary directions for my supply; and when this honest
captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the
English merchants there, to send over, not the order only,
but a full aucount of my story to a merchant at London,
who re resented it effectually to her, whereupon she not
only do ivered the money, but, out of her own pocket, 'sent
the POrtuguese captain a very handsome present for his
humanity and charity to me.
The merchant in London, yesting this hundred, pounds
in English goods, such as the captain had Wrote for, sent
them directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all
safe to me at the Brazils among which, without my direc-
tion (for I Was too young in my business to think of them),
he had taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron work, and
utensils, necessary for_ my plantation, and which were of
great use to me. When this cargo arrived, I thought in
fortune made, for I was surprised with the joy of it; an

purchase and bring me over a servant, under bond for six
years’ service, and would not accept of any consideration,
except a little tobacco, which I would have him accept, be-
ing of my own pgodnce. Neither was this all: but my
goods being all uglish manufactures, such as cloths,
stuffs, baize, and things particularly valuable and desirable
in the country, 1 found means to sell them to a very great
advantage; so that I might say, I had more than four

from Lisbon: and now, increasing in business and in wealth,
my head began to be full of proyects and undertakings be~
yond my reach; such as are, indeed, often the ruin of the
est heads in business. Had I continued in the station I
was now in, I had room for all the happy things to have
yet befallen me, for which my father so earnestly recom-
mended a quiet, retired life, and which he had so sensibly
described the middle station of life to be full of: but other
things attended me, and I was still be to be the willful
agent of all my own miseries; and, particularly, to increase

my future sorrows I should have leisure to make, all these
miscarriages were rocured by my apparent obstinate ad-
hering to my foolis inclination, of wandering about, and
pursuing that inclination, in contradiction to the clearest
views of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of
those prospects, and these measures of life, which nature
and Providence concurred to present me with, and to make
my duty).
As I ad once done thus in breaking awa from my par-
ents, so I could not be content now, but must go and
leave the happy view 1 had of being a rich and thriving
man in my new plantation, only to pursue a rash and im‘
moderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the
thing admitted; and thus I cast myself down again into
the deepest gulf of human misery that ever man fell into,
or perhaps could be consistent with life, and a state of
health in the world.
To come then, by 'ust degrees, to the particulars of this
art of my story— on may suppose, that having now
ived almost four years in the Brazils, and beginuin to
thrive and prosper very well upon my plantation, I ad
not only learned the language, but had contracted an ac-
quaintance and friendship among my fellow-planters, an

well as among the merchants at St. Salvador, which was
our port: and that, in my discourses among them, 1 had
frequently given them an account of my two voyages to
the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the
Negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase on the
aosmson causes. 37
hatchets, bits of glass, and the like—not only gold dust,
Guinea grains, elephants’ teeth, etc., but Negroes, for the
service of the Brazils, in great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my discourses
on these heads, but especially to that part which related to
the buying of Negroes; which was a trade, at that time, not
only not far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been
carried on by the assimztos, or permission of the kings of
Spain and Portugal, and engrossed from the public; so
that few Negroes were bought, and those excessively dear.
It happened, being in company with some merchants
and planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those
things very earnestly, three of them came to me the next
morning, and told me they had been musing very much
upon what I had discoursed with them of the last night,
and they came to make a secret proposal to me: and, after
enjoining me to secrecy, they told me that they had a mind

tions as well as I, and were straitened for nothin so much
as servants; that as it was a trade that could not e carried
on, because they could not publicly sell the Negroes when
they came home, so they desired to make but one voyage
to bring the Negroes on shore privately, and divide them
among their own plantations; and, in a word, the question
was, whether I would go their supercargo in the ship, to
manage t e trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and
they oifere me that should have an equal share of the
Negroes, without providing any part of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must he confessed, had it
been made to any one that had not a settlement and plan-
tation of his own to look after, which was in a fair way of
coming to be very considerable, and with a good stock
upon it. But for me, that was thus entered and estab-
lished, and had nothing to do but go on as I had begun,
for three or four years more, and to have sent for the other
hundred pounds from England; and who, in that time and
with that little addition, could scarce have failed of being
worth three or four thousand pounds sterling, and that in-
creasing too; for me to think of such a voyage, was the
most preposterous thing that ever man, in such circum-
stances, could be guilty of.
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no

ling designs, when my father’s good counsel was lost upon
me. In a word, I told them I would go with all my heart,
if they would undertake to look after my plantation in my
absence, and wonldvdispose of it to such as 1 should direct,
it I miscarried. This they all engaged to do, and entered
into writings 0r covenants to do so: and I made a formal
will, disposing of my plantation and effects, in case of my
death; making the captain of the ship that had saved my
life, as before, my universal heir; but obliging him to dis-
pose of my effects as 1 had directed in my will; one-half of
the produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped
to England. In short, I took all possible caution to pre-
serve my etfects, and to keep up my plantation: had I used
half as much prudence to have looked into my own inter-
est, and have made a judgment of what I ought to have
done and not to have done, I had certainly never gone away
from so prosperous an undertaking, leaving all the prob-
able views of a thriving circumstance, and gone a voyage
to sea, attended with all its common hazards, to say noth-
ing of the reasons I had to expect particular misfortunes
to myself.

my fancy, rather than my reason: and accordingly, the

away to the northward upon our own coast, with design to
stretch over for the African coast. When they came about
ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, it seems,
-was the manner of their course in those days, we had very
good weather, only excessively hot all the way upon our
‘ own coast, till we came to the height of Cape St. August-
ino; from whence, keeping further oil at sea, we lost sight
of land, and steered as if we were bound for the isle Fer-i
nando de Noronha, holding our course N.E. by N. and,
leaving those isles on the east. In this course we passed
the Line in about twelve days’ time, and were, by our last
observation, in seven degrees tWenty-two minutes northern
latitude, when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us
quite out of our'knowledge: it began from the south-east,
came about to the north-west, and. then settled in the
north-east; from whence it blew in such a terrible manner,
that for twelve days together we could do nothing but
drive, and, scudding away before it, let it carry us whither-
soever fate and the fury of the winds directed; and, during
these twelve days, 1 need not say that 1 expected every day
to be swallowed up; ‘nor, indeed, did any in the ship expect
to save their lives. ‘
In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the storm,
one of our men dead of the calenture, and one man and a
boy washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the
weather abating a little, the master made an observation
as well as he could, and found that he was in about eleven
de rees north latitude, but that he was twenty-two degrees
of ongitude difference, west from Cape St. Augustino; so
that he found he was got upon the coast of Guiana, or the
north part of Brazil, beyond the river Amazon, toward
that of the river Oronoco, commonly called the Great
River; and began to consult with me what course he
should take, for the ship was leaky and very much dis-
abled, and he was for gomg directly back to the coast of
Brazil.
1 was positively against that; and looking over the charts
of the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there

voyage to the coast of Africa without some assistance, both
to our ship and ourselves.
With this design we changed our course and steered away
N. W. by W., in order to reach some 0! our English islands,
where I hoped for relief; but our voyage was otherwise de~
termined; or being in the latitude of twelve degrees eigh-
teen minutes, a second storm came upon us which carried
us away with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us
so out of the way of all human commerce, that had
all our lives been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in
danger of being devoured by savages than ever returning
to our own country.
In this distress, the wind still blowing ver hard, one of
our men early in the morning, cried out, nd! and we
had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of
seeing whereabouts in the world we were, than the ship
struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her motion being
so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner that
we expected we should all have perished immediately; and
we were immediately driven into our close quarters, to
shelter us from the foam and spray of the sea.
It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like
condition to describe or conceive the consternation of men
in such circumstances; we knew nothing where we were,
or upon what land it was we were driven, whether an island
or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; and as
the rage of the wind was still great, though rather less than

many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the wind,
by a kind of miracle, should immediately turn about. In
a word we sat looking upon one another, and expecting
death every moment, and every man acting accordingly, as
preparing for another world; for there was little or noth-
ing more for us to do in this. That which was our present
comfort, and all the comfort we had, was that, contrary to
our expectation, the ship did not break yet, and that the
master said the wind began to abate.
Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate,
yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and stick-
ing too fast for us to expect her getting off, we were in a
!dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing to do, but to
think of saving our lives as well as we could. We had a
aosmson cnuson. 41
I staved by dashing against the ship’s rudder, and, in the
next place, she broke away, and either sunk, or was driven
off to sea; so there was no hope from her; we had another
boat on board, but how to get her off into the sea was a
doubtful thing; however, there was no room to debate, for
we fancied the ship would break in pieces every minute,
and some told us she was actually broken already.
i In this distress the mate of our vessel laid hold of the
boat, and with the help of the rest of the men they got her
aosmson cnuson. 41
her go and committed ourselves, being eleven in number,
to God’s mercy, and the wild sea; for though the storm
was abated considerably, yet the sea went dreadfully high
u on the shore, and might be well called den wild zee, as
the utch call the sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw
plainly, that the sea went so high, that the boat could not
live, and that we should be inevitably drowned. As to
making sail, we had none; nor, if we had, could we have
done anything with it; so we worked at the car toward the
land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to execu-
tion; for we all knew that when the boat came nearer to
the shore, she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the
breach of the sea. However, we committed our souls to
God in the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us
toward the shore, we hastened our destruction with our
own hand, pulling as well as we could toward land.
What the shore was—whether rock or sand, whether
steep or shoal—we knew not; the only hope that could
rationally give us the least shadow of expectation, was, if
we might happen into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of
some river, where by great chance we might have run our
boat in, or got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made
smooth water.- But nothing of this appeared; and as we
made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more
frightful than the sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league
and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-
like, came rolling astern of us, and plainly bade us expect
the coup de grace. In a word, it took us with such fury,
that it overset the boat at once; and separating us, as wall
from. theboat as from one another, gave us no time hardly
to say, “ Oh, God!” for we were all swallowed up in a mo-
ment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I
felt, when I sunk into the water; for though I swam very
well, yet I could not deliver myself from the waves so as
to draw my breath, till that wave having driVen me, or
rather carried me, a vast way on toward the shore, and
having spent itself, Went back, and left me upon the land
almost dry, but half dead with the water I took in. I had
so much presence of mind, as well as breath left, that see-
ing myself nearer the main land than I expected, 1 got
upon my feet and endeavored to make on toward the land
as fast as I could, before another wave should return and
take me up a ain; but I soon found it was impossible to
avoid it; for saw the sea come after me as high as a great
.hill, and as furious as an enemy which I had no means or
strength to contend with ; my business was to hold my
breath and raise myself upon the water, if 1 could; and so,
by swimming, to preserve my breathing and pilot myself
toward the shore, if possible; my greatest Concern now be-
ing that the wave, as it would carry me a great way toWard
the shore when it came on, might not carry me back again
with it when it gave back toward the sea.
The wave that came upon me again buried me at once
twent or thirty feet deep in its own body, and I could feel
myelf carried with a mighty force and swiftness toward
the shore, a very great way; but I held my breath, and
assisted myself to swim still forward with all my might.
I was ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as 1
b felt myself rising up, so, to my immediate relief, 1 found
my head and hands shoot out above the surface of the
water; and thou h it was not two seconds of time that 1
could keep mysel so, yet it relieved me greatly, gaVe me
breath and new courage. 1 was covered again with Water

ing the Water had spent itsel , and began to return, I struck
forward against the return of the waves, and felt ground
again with my feet. I stood still a few moments, to re-
cover breath, and till the water went from me, and then
took to my heels and ran with what strength I had further
toWard the shore. But neither Would this deliver me from

The last time 01 these two had well-nigh been fatal to
me; for the sea having hurried me along, as before, landed
me, or rather dashed me, against a piece of rock, and
that with such force that it left me senseless, and indeed
helpless, s to my own deliverance; for the blow, taking
my side a 6 breast, heat the breath, as it Were, quite out
of- my body; and had it returned again immediately, I must
have been strangled in the water; but I recovered a little
ggfore the return of the waves, and, seeing I should again

piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till

so near the shore that the next wave, though it went over

up and. thank God that my life was saved, in a case where-
in there were, some minutes before, scarcely any room to
hope. I believe it is impossible to. express, to the life,
what the ecstasies and transports 0f the soul are, when it is
so saved, as I may say, out of the grave; and I did not
wonder now at the custom, viz. , that when a malefactor,

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel—when the breach
and froth of the sea being so big I could hardly see it, it lay
so far off—and considered, Lord! how was it possible I
could get on shore? ‘
After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part
of my condition I began to look around me, to see what
kind of a place 1 was in, and what was next to be done;
and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in a word,
I had a dreadful deliverance; for I was wet, had no clothes
to shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink, to com-
fort me; neither did I see any prospect before me, but that
of perishing with hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts;

I had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature for
my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other creat-
ure that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I
had nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a
little tobacco in a box. This was all my provision; and
this threw me into such terrible agonies of mind, that for
awhile I ran about like a madman. Night coming upon
me, I began, with a heavy heart, to consider what would

WHEN I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and
the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as
before; but that which surprised me most was that the

A little after noon, I found the sea very calm, and the
tide ebbed so far out that 1 could come within a quarter of
a mile of the ship; and here I found a fresh renewing of
my grief, for I saw evidently that if we had kept on board
we had been all safe; that is to say, we had all got safe on
shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left entire-
ly destitute of all comfort and company as 1 now was.
This forced tears from my eyes again; but as there was lit-
tle relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship;
so I pulled off my clothes, for the weather was hot to ex-
tremity, and took the water; but when I came to the ship

would be very necessary to me.
It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to

several spare yards, and two or three large spars of wood,
and a spare topmast or two in the ship; I resolved to fall

My next care was for some ammunition and arms.
There were two very good fowliug-pieces in the great

ship, but knew not where our gunner had 'stOv‘ved them"
but wi'l much search I found them, two of them dry and
good, the third had taken water. Those two I got to my
raft, with the arms. And now I thought myself pretty
_well ireighted, and began to think howl should get to
shore with them, having neither sail, oar, nor rudder; and
the least capful of wind would have overset all my naviga-

I had three encouragements: let. A smboth‘ calm sea;

What little wind there was blew me toward the land. And
thus, having found two or three broken oars belonging to
the boat, and besides the tools which were in the chest, I
found two saws, an ax, and a hammer; and with this cargo
1 put to sea. For a mile or thereabouts my raft went very
well, only that 1 found it drive a little distant from the
place where I had landed before; by which I perceived that

As I imagined, so it was; there appeared before me a lit-
tle opening of the land, and I found a strong current of
the tide set into it; so I guided my raft as well as I could,
to get into the middle of the stream. But here I had like
to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I
think it verily would have broken my heart; for, knowing
nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it
upona shoal, and not being aground at the other end, it
wanted but a little that all my car 0 had slipped off toward
that end that was afloat, and so allen into the water. I
did my utmost, by setting my back a ainst the chests, to
keep them in their places, but coul not thrust off the
raft with all my strength; neither durst I stir from the
posture I was in, but holding up the cheats with all my
might, I stood in that manner near half an hour, in which
time the rising of the water brought me a little more upon

myself in the mouth of a little river, with land on both sides,
and a strong current or tide running up. I looked on both
sides for a proper place to get to shere, for I was not will-
ing to be driven too high up the river, hoping in time to
see some shi at sea, and therefore resolved to place my-
self as near t e coast as I could.
At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the

As soon as I found water enough, for my raft drew about
a foot of water, 1 thrust her upon that flat piece of ground,

whether inhabited or not inhabited; whether in danger of
wild beasts or not. There was a hill, not above a mile
from me, which rose up very steep and high, and which
seemed to overtop some other hills, which lay as in a ridge
from it, northward. I took out one of the fowling- ieces,
and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder, an thn,

and beak resembling it, but it had no talons or claws more

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft,
and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took
me up the rest of that day; what to do with myself at
night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest, for I was
afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but some
wild beast might devour me; then h, asl afterward found,
there was really no need for those cars. However, as well
as I could, I barricaded myself round with the chests and
boards that I had brou ht on shore, and made a kind of

which way to supply myself, except that I had seen two or
three creatures, like hares, run out of the wood where 1
shot the fowl.
I now began to consider that I might yet get a great '

I soon emptied the hogshead of that read, and wrapped
it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails which 1 cut

The next day I made another voya e, and now havin

into pieces such as 1 could move, I got two cables and a
hawser on shore, with all the iron work -1 could get; and
having cut down the spritsail-yard, and the mizzen-yard,
and everything I could, to make a large raft, I loaded it
with all those heavy goods, and came away; but my good
luck began now to leave me, for this raft was so unwieldy
and so overladen that after I was entered the little cove,
where I had landed the rest of my goods, not being able to,
guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset, and threw
me and all my cargo into the water; as for myself, it was
no great harm, for 1 was near the shore, but as‘to my
cargo, it was a great part of it lost, especially the iron,
which I expected would have been of great use to me; how-
ever, when the tide was out I got most of the pieces of cable
“ aoameos cause!
for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work which
fatigued me very much. After this I went every day on
board, and brought away what 1 could get.
I had now been thirteen days ashore, and had been
eleven. times on board the shi , in which time I had
brought away all that one pair 0 hands could well be sup-
posed capable to bring; though I believe verily, had the
calm weather held, 1 should have brought away the whole
ship piece by piece, but preparing, the twelfth time, to go
on board, I found the wind began to rise; however, at low
water, I went on board, and though I thought I had rum~
maged the cabin so effectually as that nothing could be
found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one
of which I found two or three razors. and one pair of large
scissors, with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks;
in another I found about thirty-six pounds in money, some
European coin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some
old, and some silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. Oh, drug!
I exclaimed, what art thou good for? Thou art not worth
to me, no, not the taking 011 the ground; one of those
knives is worth all this heap. I have no manner of use for
thee; e’en remain where thou art, and go to the bottom, as
a creature whose life is not worth saving; However, upon
second thoughts, I took it away, and wrapping all this in a
piece of canvas, I began to think of making another raft;
ut while I was preparing this I found the sky overcast,
and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it
blew a fresh gale from the shore. 1t presently occurred to
me that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the
wind off sliore; and that it was my business to be gone be-

able to reach the shore at all. Accordingly I let myself
down into the water, and swam across the channel which
lay between the ship and the sands, and even that with
ROBINSON causes. 53
I had about me, and partly the roughness of the water; for
the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high
water it blew a storm. ~
But I was got home to my little tent, where I lay, with
\ all my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all
that night, and in the morning when I looked out, behold,
no more ship was to be seen! i was a little surprised, but

I had lost no time nor abated no diligence to get everythin

anything out of her, except what might drive on shore,
from her wreck; as, indee , divers pieces of her afterward
did ; but those things were of small use to me.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing
myself against either savages, if any should appear, or
wild beasts, if any were in the island; and I had many
thou hts of the method how to do this, and what kind of
dwel ing to make, whether 1 should make me a cave in the
earth or a tent upon the earth; and, in short, I resolved
upon both; the manner and description of which it may
not be improper to give an account of.
I soon found the place I was in was not for my settle-
ment, particularly because it was upon a low, moorish
ground, near the sea, and I believed it would not be whole- ‘
some; and more particularly because there was no fresh

more convenient spot of ground.
1 consulted several things in my situation, which I found
Would be proper for me: First, air and fresh water, 1 just
now mentioned; secondly, shelter from the heat of the sun;
thirdly, security from ravenous creatures, whether men or
beasts; fourthl , a view to the sea, that if God sent any
ship in sight, might not lose any advantage for my de-
liverance, of which I was not willing to banish all my ex-
pectation yet.
In search for a place proper for this, 1 found alittle
lain on the side of a rising hill, whose front toward this
'ttle plain was steep as a house-side, so that nothing could
come down upon me from the top. On the side of this
rock, there was a hollow place, worn a little way in, like
the entrance or door of a cave; but there was not really
any cave or way into the rock at all.
54 1“-vJlA~-~~‘_{ tl.-....-;.
resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above a
hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay like
a green before my door; and, at the end of it, descended
irregularly every way down into the low ground by the sea-
side. It was on the N. N. W. side of the bill; so that it was
sheltered from the heat every day, till it came to a Wt and
by S. sun, or thereabouts, which, in those countries, is
near the setting. -
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the
hollow place, which tookgin abgutten yards in its semi- >
diameter from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter,
from its beginning and ending.
In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes,

did not stand above six inches from each other.
Then 1 took the pieces of cable which I cut in the shi
and laid them in rows, one upon another, within the eirc e,
between these two rows~of stakes, up to the top, placing
other stakes in the inside, leaning against them, about two
feet and a half high, like a spur to a post; and this fence
was so strong that neither man nor beast could get into it
or over it. This cost me a great deal of time and labor,
especially to cut the piles in the woods, bring them to the
place, and drive them into the earth. '
The entrance into this place I made to be not b a door,

all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores,
of which you have the account above; and I made a large
tent, which, to preserve me from the rains that in one part
of the year are very violent there, I made double, viz., one
smaller tent within and one larger tent above it, and cov-
ered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had
saved among the sails. .
And now I lay no more for awhile in the bed which I
had brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed
a very good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship.
Into this tent I brought all. my rovisions, and every-

all my goods, I made up the entrance, which till now I had
legtdopen, and so passed and repassed, as 1 said, by a short
la er.
When 1 had done this I began to work my way into the
rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug
down out through my tent, I laid them up within my fence
in the nature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground
within about a foot and a half; and thus 1 made me a cave,
just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my
house. It cost me much labor and many days, before all
these things were brought to perfection; and therefore I
must go back to some other things which took up some Of
my thoughts. At the same time it happened, after I had

storm was over I laid aside all my works, my building and

in all was about two hundred and forty pounds weight,
was divided into not less than a hundred parcels. As to
the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any dan-

ancy, I called my kitchen, and the rest I hid up and down
in holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come to it,
marking very carefully where I laid it. ' 2

they were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the rocks,
they took no notice of me, from whence I concluded that

downward that they did not readily see objects that were

by her, which she gave suck to, which grieved me heartily;
but when the old one fell the kid stood stock-still by her
till I came and took her up; and not only so, but when I
carried the old one with me, upon my shoulders, the kid
followed me uite to my inclosure; upon which I laid down
the dam, an took the kid in my arms, and carried it

cave, and what conveniences i made, I shall ive a full ac-
count of it in its pro r place; but I must rst give some »
little account of myse f, and of my thoughts about living,
which, it may well be supposed, were not a few.
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was
not cast away upon that island without being driven, as 1:
said, by a violent storm quite out of the course of our in-
tended voyage, and a great way, viz., some hundredi 0‘
leagues, out of the ordinary course of the trade of meal
kind, 1 had great reason to consider it as a determination
of Heaven, that in this desolate place, and in this desolate
manner, I should end my life. The tears would run
59 nonmson cnuson. '
and sometimes I would expostulate with myself why Provi-
dence should thus completely ruin its creatures, and render
them so absolutely miserable; so abandoned without hel ,
so entirely depressed, that it could hardly be rational to Be
thankful for such a life.
But something always returned swift upon me to check
these thoughts, and to reprove me; and particularly, one
day walking with my gun in my hand, by the sea-side, l
was very pensive upon the subjct of my resent condition,
when reason, as it were, expostulated With me the other
way, thus: Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true;
but, pray remember, where are the rest of on? Did not
on come eleven of you into the boat? here are the

on singled out? Is it better to be here or there? And
hen I pointed to the sea. All evils are to be considered
with the good that is in them, and with what worse attends
them.
Then it occurred to me again, how well 1 was furnished
for m subsistence, and what would have been my case it

to provide myself in such a manner as to live without my
gun, when my ammunition was spent; so that 1 had a
tolerable view of subsisting, without any want, as long as I
lived; for 1 considered, from the beginning, how I would
provide for the accidents that might happen, and for the
time that was to come, notrgnly after my ammunition
{ould be spent, but even after my health or strength

I confess, I had not entertained any notion of my am-
munition being destroyed at one blast, I mean my powder
being blown up by lightning; and this made the thoughts
of it so surprising to me when it lightened and thundered,
as I observed just now.
And now being about to enter into a melancholy relation
of a scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of
in the world before, 1 shall take it from its beginning and
continue it in its order. It was, by my account, the 30th

Want of Tools—He arranges his Habitation.
AFTER 1 had been there about ten or twelve days, it
came into my thoughts that 1 should lose my reckoning of
time for want of books and pen and ink, and should even
forget the Sabbath days from the Working days; but, to
prevent this, I cut it with my knife upon a large post, in
capital letters; and making it into a great cross, set-it up

and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and
yearly reckoning of time.
But it happened that among the many things which I
brought out of the ship, in the several vo ages which, as
above mentioned, 1 made to it, I got several things or less
value, but not at all less useful to me, which I found s'ome~

that he could fetch me, nor any company that he could
make up to me, 1 only wanted to have him talk to me, but
that would not do. As I observed before, I found pens,
ink, and paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost; and
I shall show that while my ink lasted, I kept 'Jhings very
exact, but after that was gone, I could not; for I could not
make any ink, by any means that I could devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many things,
notwithstanding all that I had amassed together; and of
these this of ink was one, as also a spade, pick-ax, and
shovel, to dig or remove the earth, needles, pins, and
thread; as for linen, I soon learned to want that without

1 now began to consider seriously my condition, and the
circumstance I was reduced to; and I drew up the state of
my affairs in writing, not so much to leave them to any
that were to come after me (for 1 was like to have but few
heirs), as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condi—
tion, and given 'over looking out to sea, to see it I could
spy a ship; I say, given over these things, I began to apply
myself to accommodate my way ol.‘ living, and to make
things as easy to me as 1 could.
I have already described my habitation, which Was a

pale of posts and cables; but 1 might now rather call it a
wall, for I raised a kind of Wall against it of turfs, about
two feet thick on the outside: and after some time (1 think
it was a year and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to
the rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees,
and such things as 1 could get, to keep out the rain; which
1 found, at some times of the year, very violent.

up all my place; I had no room to turn m self: so 1 set
myself to enlarge my cave, and work fur her into the

the labor I bestowed on it: and when I found 1 was retty
safe as to the beasts of prey, I worked sideways, 50 the
right hand, into the rock, and then turning to the right
again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out

, This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were, a
back way to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me
room to stow my goods. '
And now I began to apply myself to make such hec'ss-
sary things as I found I most wanted, particularly a chaii
and a table; for without these I was not able to enjoy. the
few comforts I had in the World; I could not write, or eat,
or do several things with so much pleasure, without a
table: so I went to work. And here I must needs observe,
that as reason is the substance and original of the mathe-
matics, so by stating and squaring everything by reason,
and by making the most rational judgment of things, every
man may be, in time, master of every mechanic art. I
had never handled a tool in my life; and yet, in time, by
labor, application, and eontrivance I found at last, that I
wanted nothing but I could have made, especially if I had

by this method, I could make but one board of a whole
tree; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more
than I had for a prodigious deal of time and labor which
it took me up to make a plank or board: but my time or
labor was little worth, an so it was as well employed one
way as another.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed

at when I wrought out some boards, as above, I made
Iarge shelves, of the breadth of afoot and a half, one over
another, all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools,
nails, and iron work on; and, in a word, to separate every-
thing at large in their places, that I might easily come at
them. I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock, to hang
my guns, and. all things that would hang up: so that. had

of mind; and my journal would, too, have been full of
many dull things: for example, I must have said thus—

self a little, I ran about the shore, wringing my hands, and

beating my head and face, exclaimin at my misery, and
crying out I was undone, undone! til, tired and faint, l
was forced to lie down on the ground to repose; but durst
not sleep, for fear of being devoured.”
Some days after this, and after I had been on board the
ship and got all that I could out of her, I could not forbear
getting up to the top of a little mountain, and looking out
to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship: then fancy that, at a vast
distance, I spied a sail, please myself with the hopes of it,
and, after looking steadily, till I was almost blind, lose it
quite, and sit down and weep like a child, and thus in-
crease my misery by my folly.
But, havin got over these things in some measure, and
having settlergl my household stuff and habitation, made
me a table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I
could, I began to keep my journal: of which I shall here
give you the copy (though in it will be told all these partic-
ulars over again) as long as it lasted; for, having no more
ink, 1 was forced to leave it off.

SEPTEMBER 30th, 1659. I, poor miserable Robinson

broken in pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get
on board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for
my relief,) so, on the other hand, it renewed my rief at
the loss of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we ad all
stayed on board, might have saved the ship, or, at least,
that they Muld not have been all drowned, as they were:
and that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps have
built us a boat, out of the ruins of the ship, to have carried
as to some other part of the world. I spent 'great part of
this day in perplexing myself on these things; but, at

days 1 killed a large bird t at was good to eat; but I knew
not what to call it.

the rock, to make room for my further convenience.
Note. Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work,
viz., a pickax, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket; so
1 desisted from my work, and began to consider how to
supply these wants, and make me some tools. As for a '
pickax, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper
enough, though heavy: but the next thing was a shovel or
spade; this was so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I

exceeding heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood,
and my having no other way, made me a long while upon
this machine: for I worked it effectually, by little and
little, into the form of a shovel or spade; the handle exact-
1y shaped like ours in .England, only that the broad part
having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last
me so long: however, it served well enough for the uses
which 1 had occasion to put it to; but never was a shovel,
I believe, made after that fashion, or so long in making.

that 1 had no notion of; neither did I know how to 0

gave it over: and, for carrying away the earth which I dug

laborers carry mortar in for the bricklayers. This was not

times, in the wet season of the year, it rained so hard that
1 could not keep myself dry; which caused me afterward
to cover all my place within my pale with long poles, and

not without reason too; for if I had been under it, I should
never have wanted a grave-digger. Upon this disaster, I
had a great deal of work to do over again, for 1 had the
loose earth to carry out; and, which was of more import-

no more would come down.

Dec. 28, 29, 30, 31. Great heats, and no breeze; so that

January 1. Very hot still; but I went abroad early and
late with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day.
This evening, going further into the valleys which lay
toward the center of the island, I found there was plenty
cf goats, though exceeding shy, and hard to come at; how-
ever, I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt
them down. Accordingly, the next day, I went out with
my dog, and set him upon the goats: but I was mistaken,
for they all faced about open the dog: and he knew his
danger too well, for he would not come near them.

myself that if any people were to come on shore there they
would not perceive anything like a. habitation: and it was
very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a'
very remarkable occasion.
During this time, I made my rounds in the woods for
game every day, when the rain permitted me, and made
frequent discoveries, in these walks, of something or other
to my advantage; particularly, I found a kind of wild
pigeons, who build, not as wood-pigeons, in a tree, but
rather as house-pigeons, in the hOles of the rocks: and,
taking some young ones, I endeavored to breed them up

as indeed, as to some of them, it was: for instance, I could!
never make a cask to be hooped. I had a small runlet or
two, as I observed before; ,but I could never arrive at the
capacity of making one by them, though I spent many
weeks about it: I could neither put in the heads, nor join
the staves so true‘ to one another as to make them hold|

water; so I gaVe that also over. In the next place, I was
at a great loss for candle; so that as soon as it was dark,
which was generally by seven o’clock, I was obliged to go
to bed. I remember the lump of bees-wax with which I
made candles in my ‘African adventure; but I had none of
that now: the only remedy I had was, that when I had
killed a goat, I i“ saved the tallow; and with a little dish
made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added
a Wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave
me light, though not a clear steady light like a candle. In
the middle of all my labors it happened, that in rummag-
ing my things, I found a little bag; which, as I hinted be-

not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship
came from Lisbon. What little remainder of corn had
been in the bag Was all devoured by the rats, and I saw
nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being willing
to haVe the bag for some other use (I think it was to put.~
powder in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or
some such use), I shook the husks of corn out of it, on one

It Was a little before the great rain just now mentioned,
that I threw this stuff away; taking no notice of anything,
and not so much as remembering that I had thrown any-
‘thing there, when, about a month after, I saw Some few
blades of something green, shooting out of the ground,
which fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I
was surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little
longer time, I saw about ten -or twelve ears come out,
which were perfect green barley, of the same kind as our
European, nay, as our, English barley. I
It is impossible to express the astonishment and confu-
sion of my thoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted
upon no religious foundation at all: indeed, I had ver few
notions of religion,in my head, nor had entertains any
sense of any things that had befallen me, otherwise than as
chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases God; without so
much as inquiring into the end of Providence in these
things, or his order in governing events in the world. But
after I saw barley grow there, in a climate which I knew
' was not proper for corn, and especially as I knew not how
it came there, it startled Inc strangely; and I began to sug-
gest, that God had miraculously caused this grain to grow

without any help of seed sown, and that it was so directed
purely for my sustenance, on that wild miserable place.
This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of
my eyes; and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy
of nature should happen upon my account: and this was
the more strange to me, because 1 saw near it still, all
alon by the side of the rock, some other straggling stalks,
whicIr 1proved to he stalks of rice, and which I knew, be-
cause had‘ seen it grow in Africa, when I was ashore
there.
1 not only thought these the pure productions of Provi-
dence for mysupport, but, not doubting that there was
more in the place, 1 went over all’ that part of the island
where I had been before, searching in every corner, and

At last it occurred to my thoughts, that I had shook out a
bag of chicken’s-meat in that place, and then the wonder
began to cease; and 1 must confess, my religious thankful-
ness to God’s providence began to abate too, upon the dis-
covering that all this was nothing but what was common;
though ought to have been as thankful for so strange and
unforeseen a providence, as if it had been miraculous: for
it was really the work of Providence, as to me, that should
order or appoint that ten or twelve grains of corn should
remain unspoiled, when the rats had destroyed all the rest,
as if it had been dropped from heaven; as also, that I
should throw it out in that particular place, where, it be-
ing in the shade of a high rock, it sprung up immediately;
whereas, if 1 had thrown it anywhere else, at that time, it
would have been burned up and destroyed.
1 carefully saved the ears ofthis corn, y0u may be sure,
in their season, which was about the end of June; and,
laying up every corn, I resolved to sow them all again;

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or
thirty stalks of rice. which I preserved withtho same care;
and whose use was of the same kind, or to the same pur-
pose, viz., to make me bread, or rather food; for I found
ways to 000k it up without baking, though I did that also
after some time. But to return to my journal.
I worked excessively hard these three or four months, to
get my wall done; and the 14th of April 1 closed it up;

the case was thusz—As I was busy in the inside of it, be-

ribly frightened with a most dreadful surprising thing in-
deed; for, all on a sudden, I found the earth come crumb-
ling down from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of
the hill over my head, and two of the posts 1 had set up in
the cave cracked in a frightful manner. I was heartily
scared; but thought nothing of what really was the cause,
only thinking that the top of my cave was falling in, as
some of it had done before: and for fear I should be buried
in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not thinking myself
safe there neither, I got over my wall fbr fear of the pieces
of the hill which I expected might roll down upon me. I

plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake: for the ground I
stood dn shook three times at about eight minntes’ dis-
tan ee, with three such shocks as would have overturned the
strongest building that could be supposed to have stood on
the earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock, which
stood about half a mile from me, next the sea, fell down
with such a terrible n0ise as I never heard in all my life.
1 perceived also that the very sea. was put into a violent
motion by it; and I believe the shocks were stronger under
the water than on the island.
I was so much amazed with the thing itself (havin

second time.
After the third shock was own, and I felt no more for
some time, I began to take courage; yet I had not heart
enough to go over my wall again, for fear of being buried
alive; but sat still upon the ground greatly castdown, and
disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All this while I
had not the least serious religious thought; nothing but
the common “ Lord, have mercy upon me! ” and when it

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow
cloudy, as if it would rain; and soon after the wind‘rose by

and a terrible storm it was. This held about three hours,

when, one sudden, it came into my thoughts that these
winds and rain being the consequence of the earthquake,
the earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might ven-
ture into my cave again. With this thought my spirits be-
gan to revive; and the rain also helping to persuade me, I
went in, and sat down in my tent; but the rain was so vio-
lent, that my tent was ready todhe beaten down with it;
and I was forced to get into my cave, though very much
afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head.

After I had been in my cave for some time, and found no
more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be more

part of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad: but
my mind being more cemposed, I began to think of whatI
had best do; concluding, that if the island was subject to
these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a
cave, but I must consider of building me some little but in
an o 11 place, which I might surround with a wall, as I
had One here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts
or men: for if I stayed where I was, I should certainly,
one time or other, be buried alive.
With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from '
the place where it now stood, being just under the hanging
precipice of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken
again, would certainly fall upon my tent. I spent the next
two days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving
where and how to remove my habitation. The fear of be-
ing swallowed alive affected me so that I never slept in
quiet; and yet the apprehension of lying abroad, without
any fence, was almost equal to it: but‘still, when I looked
about, and saw how everything was put in order, how
pleasantly I Was concealed, and how safe from danger, it
made me very loath to remove. ‘ In the meantime, it
occurred to me that it would require a vast deal of tinm
for 'me to do this; and that I must be contented to run the
risk where I was, till I had formed a convenient camp,
and secured it so as to remove to it. With this conclusion
I composed myself for a time; and resolved that I would
go, to work with all speed to build me a wall with ‘piles and
cables, etc., in a circle as before, and set up my tent in it

it and grind my tools too. This caused me as much
thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand
point of politics, or a judge upon the life and death of a

it with my foot, that I might have both my hands at lib-
erty.

at least not to take notice how it was done, though since 1
have observed it is very common there: besides that, my
grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine cost
me a. full week’s work to bring it to perfection.

MAY 1. In the, morning, looking toward the sea-side,
the tide being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger
than ordinary, and it looked like a cask; when I came to
it I found a small barrel, and two or three pieces of the
wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by the late
hurricane; and looking toward the wreck itself, I thought
it seemed to lie higher out of the water than it used to do.
I examined the barrel that was driven on shore, and soon
Iound it was a barrel of gunpowder; but it had taken
water, and the powder was caked as hard as a stone; how-
ever, I rolled it further on the shore for the present, and
went on upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of
the ship, to look for more.
When 1 came down to the ship I found 1t strangely re-
moved. The forecastle, which lay before buried in the
sand, was heaved up at least six feet; and the stern (which
was broke to pieces, and parted from the rest, by the force
of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging of her) was
tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one side; and the sand
was thrown so high on that side next her stern, that I could
now walk quite up to her when the tide was out; whereas
there was a great piece of water before, so that I could not
come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swim-

eluded it must be done by the earthquake; and as by this
violence the ship was more broken open than formerly, so
many things came daily on shore, which the sea had
loosenrd, and which the winds and water rolled by degrees
to the land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of re-
moving my habitation; and I busied myself mi htily, that
day especially, in searching whether 1 could ma e any way
into the ship; but I found nothing was to be expected of
that kind. for all the inside of the ship was choked u with
sand. However, as I had learned not to despair 0 an -
thin , I resolved to pull everything to pieces that I co d

obliged to give over for that time. '

to drive the hatchet.

but he moved forward toward me with a long speau or
weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he came to a
rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me, or I heard
a voice so terrible that it is impossible to express the ter-
ror of it; all that I can say I understood was this: Seeing
all these things have not brought thee to repentance, now
thou shalt die; at which words I thought he lifted up the
spear that was in his hand to kill, me. , ,,
No one that shall ever read this account will expect that
I should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this
terrible vision; 1 mean, that even while it was a dream, I
even dreamed of those horrors; nor is it any more possible
to describe the impression that remained upon my mind
when l awaked, and found it was but a dream.
I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had received
by the good instruction of my father was then worn out,
by an uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafarin
wickedness, and a constant conversation with none but us
as were, like mymlf, wicked and profane to iho last de-
gree. I do not remember that 1 had, in all that time, one .
thought that so much as tended. either to locking upward

ways; but a' certain stupidity of soul, without desire of
good, or consciousness of evil, had entirely overwhelmed
me, and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking,
wicked creature among our common sailors can be sup-
posed to be; not having the least sense, either of the fear
of God, in danger, or of thankfulness to Him, in deliver-

h In the relating what is already part of my story, this will
be the mIS'l‘e easily believed, when 1 shall add, that through ,
all the variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me,
I never had so much as one thought of its being the hand
of God, or that it was a just punishment for my sin;
either my rebellious behavior against my father, or my
present sins, which were great; or even as a punishment
for the general course of my wicked life. W hen l was on
the desperate expedition on the desert shores of Africa, I

go, or to keep me from the danger which apparently sur-
‘ rounded me, as well from voracious creatures as cruel sav-
ages; but I was quite thoughtless of a God or a Providence;
acted like a mere brute, from the principles of nature, and
by the dictates of common sense only, and indeed hardly
that. When 1 was delivered and taken up at sea by the
Portuguese captain, well used, and dealt with justly and
honorably, as well as charitably, 1 had not the least thank-
fulness in my thoughts. When, again, I was shipwrecked,
ruined, and in danger of drowning, on this island, 1 was as
far from remorse, or lookin on it as a judgment; I only
said to myself often that was an unfortunate dog, and

After I had eaten I tried to walk; but found myself so
Weak that I could hardly carry the gun (for 1 never went
out without that); so I went but a little way, and sat down
, upon the ground, lookin out upon the sea, which was just
before me, and very ea In and smooth. As I sat here,
some such thoughts as these occurred to me: What is this
earth and sea, of which I have seen so much? Whence is
it reduced? And what am I, and all the other creatures,
w' d and tame, human and brutal? Whence are we?
Surely, we are all made by some secret power, who
formed the earth and sea, the air and sky. And who is
that? Then it followed most naturally, It is God that has
made all. Well, but then, it came on, if God has made all
these things, He guides and governs them all, and all
things that concern them, for the power that could make
all things must certainly have power to guide and direct
them; i so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of H is
Works, either without His knowledge or appointment.
. And if nothing happens without His knowledge He
knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful condition;
and if nothing happens without His appointment, He has
a pointed all this to befall me. Nothing occurred to my
t ought to contradict any of these conclusions; and there-
fore it rested upon me with the greatest force that it must
needs be that God had appointed all this to befall me; that
I was brought to this miserable circumstance by His direc-
tion, He having the sole power, not of me only, but of
everything that happens in the world. Immediately it
followed, Why has God done this to me? What have I
done to be thus used? My conscience presently checked
me in that inquiry, as if 1 had blasphemed; and methou ht
it spoke to me like a voice! Wretch, dost thou ask w at

I went, directed b Heaven, no doubt; for in this chest

and found what I looked for, viz., the tobacco; and as the
few books I had saved lay there too, I took out one of the
Bibles which I mentioned before, and which, to this time,
I had not found leisure, or so much as inclination, to look
into. I say I took it out", and brought both that and the
tobacco with me to the table. What use to make of the
tobacco I knew not, as to my d:stemper, nor whether it

I was, as it were, made to ask myself such questions as

have I taken of it? Have I done my part? God has de-

touched my heart very much, and immediately I knelt

sickness.
July 4. In the morning I took the Bible; and beginnin
at the New Testament, I began seriously to read it; an
imposed upon myself to read awhile every morning and
every night; not binding myself to the number of chapters,
but as long as my thoughts should engage me. It was not
long after I set seriously to this work, that I found my
heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the wicked-
ness of my past life. The impression of my dream. re-
vived; and the .words, All these things have not brought
thee to repentance, ran seriously in my thoughts. I was
earnestly begging of God to give me repentance, when it
happened providentially, the very same day, that, reading
the “Scripture, I came to these words, “He is exalted a.
Prince and a Saviour; to give repentance and to give remis-
sion.” I threw dovm the book ; and with my heart as well
as :11 hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of

sense of the words, that I prayed; for now I prayed with a
sense of my condition, and with a true scripture view of
ho e, founded on the encouragement of the word of God:
an from this time, I may say, I began to have hope that
God would hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned above,
“ Call on Me, and 1 will deliver thee,” in a different sense
from what I had ever done before; for then I had no notice
of anything being called deliverance, but my being deliv-
ered from the captivity I was in: for though I was indeed
at large in the place, yet the island was certainly a prison
to me, and that in the worst sense of the word. But now
I learned to take it in another sense: now I looked back
upon my past life with such horror, and my sins appeared
l0 dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God but deliv-
erance from the load of guilt that bore down all my com-
fort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so
much as pray to be delivered from it, or think of it; it was
all of no consideration, in comparison with this. And I
add this part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that
whenever they come to a true sense of things, they will

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable
as to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind: and ,
my thoughts being directed, by constantly reading the
Scripture and praying to God, to things of a higher nature,
I had a great deal of comfort within, which, till now, I

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again;
and after going something further than I had gone the
day before, I found the brook and the savannas begin to
cease, and the country become more woody than before. '
In this part I found different fruits; and particularly I
found melons upon the ground in great abundance, and
grapes upon the trees: the vines, indeed, had spread over
the trees, and the clusters of grapes were now just in their
prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surprising discov-
ery, and I was exceedingly glad of them, but I was warned
by my experience to eat sparingly of them; remembering
that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes

came to an opening, where the country seemed to descend
to the west; and a little spring of fresh water, which issued

and very few bearing any fruit; at least not then. How-
ever, the green limes that I gathered were not only pleas-
ant to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice
afterward with Water, which made it very wholesome, and
very cool and refreshing. I found now 1 bad business
enough, to gather and carry home; and I resolved to lay
up a store, as well- of grapes as limes and lemons, to fur-
nish m self for the wet season, which I knew was approach,
ing. n order to do this, I gathered a great heap of grapes
in cne place, a lesser heap in another place; and a great
parcel of limes and lemons in another place; and taking a
few of each with me, I traveled homeward; and resolved
to come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could
make, to carry the rest home. Accordingly, having spent
three days in this journey, I came home (so I must now
call my tent and my cave): but before I got thither, the
grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruits, and the
weight of the juice, having broken and bruised them, they
were good for little or nothing: as to the limes, they were
good, but I could bring only a few.
The next day being the 19th, I went back, having made
me two small bags to bring home my harvest; but I was
surprised when coming to my heap of grapes, which were

However, as I found there was no laying them up in heaps
and no carrying them away in a sack; but‘that one way
they would be destroyed, and the other way they would be
crushed with their own weight; 1 took another course: 1
then gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and hung
them upon the out-branches of the trees, that they might
cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and lemon“,
I carried as many back as I could well stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I contemplated
with great pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the
pleasantness of the situation; the security from storms on
that side; the water and the wood; and concluded that 1

This thought ran long in my head; and l was exceeding
fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of the place tempt-

and, by the same ill-fate that brought me hither, might
bring some other unhappy wretches to the same place; and
though it was scarce probable that any such thin should
ever happen, yet to inclose myself among the hills and
woods in the center of the island, was to anticipate my
bondage, and to render such an affair not only improbable,
but impossible; and that therefore I ought not by any
means to remove. However, I was so enamored of this
place, that I spent much of my time there for- the whole

did so, for not one grain of what I sowed this time came to

grow, which I easily imagined was from the drought, I
sought for a moister piece of ground to make another trial
in; and I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower,
and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little before
the vernal equinox. This having the rainy months of
March and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly,
and yielded a very good crop; but having only art of the
seed left, and not daring to sow all that I had, got but a
small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to
above half a peek of each ind. But by this experiment I
was made master of my business, and knew exactly when
was the proper time to sow; and that I might expect two
seed-times, and two harvests, every year. '
While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery,
which was of use to me afterward. As soon as the rains
were over, and the weather began to settle, which was
about the mouth of November, I made a visit up the coun—
try to my bower; where, though I had not been for‘some
months, yet I found all things just as I had left them.
The circle or double hedge that 1 had made was not only

I FOUND now that the seasons of the year might eneral-

but into the rain seasons and the dry seasons, which were

The rainy seasons held sometimesJr nger and sometimes
shorter, as the winds happened to blow; butthis was the
general observation I made. After I had'found, by experi-
ence, the ill conse uenees of being abroad in the rain, I
took care to furnigh myself with provisions beforehand,
that I might not be obliged to go out; and I sat within
doors as much as possible during the wet months. This
time I foun much employment, and very suitable also to
the time; for I found great occasion for many things which
I had no way to furnish myself with but by hard labor and
constant ap lication: particularly, I tried many ways to
make mysel a basket: ‘but all the twigs I could get lor the
purpose rovedso brittle that they would do nothing. It
proved 0 excellent advantage to me now, that when I was
a boy, 1 used to take great delight in standing at a basket-

make their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are,

came into my mind, that t e twigs of that tree from
whence I cut my stakes that grew might ossiblybe as
gough as the sallows, willows, and osiers, in gland; and
resolved to try. Accordingly, the next day, I went to
my country-house, as I called it; and cutting some of the
smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I
could desire: whereupon 1 came the next time prepared

to supply taro other wants. I had no vessel to hold any-
thing that was liquid, except two runlets, which were almost ‘
full of rum; and some glass bottles, some of the common
size, and others (which were case bottles) square, for the
holding of waters, spirits, etc. I had not so much as a pot
to boil anything; except a great kettle, which I saved out
of the ship, and which was too big for such use as I desired
it, viz., to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itsell.
The second thing I would Iain have had, was a tobacco-
ipe; but it was impossible for me to make one; however,
ffound a oontrivauce for that too at last. I employed
myself in planting my second row of stakes or' piles, and
also in this wicker-Working all the summer or dry season;

I could not tell what part of the world this might be;

savages, where, if I should have landed, 1 had been in a

pause upon this affair, I considered that if this land was
the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or other,
see some vessel pass or repass one way or other; but if not,
then it was the savage coast between the Spanish country
and the Brazils, whose inhabitants are indeed the worst of
savages; for they are cannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not
to murder and devour all human beings that fall into their
hands.
With these considerations, walking very leisurely for-

I killed several. But I had no need to be venturous; for
I had no want of food, and of that which was very good

turtle, or tortoise. With these, added to my grapes,

than I, in proportion to the com any; and though my case
was deplorable enough, yet I h great cause for thankful-

had rather plenty, even to dainties.
I never traveled on this journey above two miles outright

runs to see what discoveries 1 could make, that I came
weary enough to the place where I resolved to sit down for
the night; and then I either reposed myself in a tree, or
surrounded myself with a row of stakes, set upright in the
ground, either from one tree to another, or so as no wild
creature could come at me without waking me.
As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was sur riscd to
see that I had taken up my lot on the worst si e of the

I concluded I would go home again, and that the next

that the weather proved hazy for three or {our days while

In this journey my dog sur rised a youn kid, and
seized upon it; and running to ta e hold of it, caught it
and saved it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to
bring it home if I could; for I had often been musing
whether it might not be possible .to get a kid or two, and
so raise a breed of tame goals, which might supply me
when my powder and shot should be all spent. I made a

very impatient to be at home, from whence I had been ab-

1 can not express what a satisfaction it was to me to
come into my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-
bcd. This little wandering journey, without a settled place
of abode, had been so unpleasant to me that my own
house, as I called it to myself, was a perfect settlement to
me, compared to that; and it rendered everything about
me so comfortable that I resolved I would never go a great
way from it again while it should be my lot to stay on the
island.

was taken up in the weighty aifair of making a cage for
my Poll, who began now to be more domestic, and to be
mighty well acquainted with me. Then I began to think,
of the poor kid which I had penned within my little circle,
and resolved to fetch it home, or give it some food; accord-
ingly I went, and found it where I left it (for indeed it
could not get out), but was almost starved for want of
food. I went and cut boughs of trees, and branches of

it, for it followed me like a dog; and as I continually fed
it, the creature became so loving, so gentle, and so fond,
that it was from that time one of my domestics also, and
would never leave me afterward. '
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come,
and I kept the 30th of September in the same solemn man-
,ner as before, being the anniversary of my landing on the

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more
happy the life I now led was, with all its miserable circum-
stances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led\ all
the past part oil my days; and now 1 chan ed both my
sorrows and my joys; my ver desires alter , my affec-

the two years past. Before. as I walked about, either on
my hunting, or for viewing the country, the anguish of
my soul at my condition would break out upon me on a
sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think
of the woods, the mountains, the deserts 1 was in; and
how 1 was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal bars and
bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without
redemption 1n the midst of the greatest composures of
my mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and
make me wring my hands and weep like a child; some-
times it would take me in the middle of my work, and I
would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
ground for an hour or two together; this was still worse to
me; but if I could burst into tears or give vent to my feel-
ings by words, it would go otf, and my grief being ex-
hausted, would abate.
v But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts;
I daily read the word of God, and applied all the comforts
of it to my present state. One morning, being very sad,
I opened the Bible upon these words, “ I will never leave
thee, nor forsake thee;” immediately it occurred that these
words were to me, why else should they be directed in such
a manner, just at the moment when I was mourning oyer
my condition, as one forsaken of God and man? Well,
then, said I, if God does not forsake me, of what ill conse-
quence can it be, or what matters it, though the world
should forsake me; seeing, on the other. hand, if 1 had all
the world, and should lose the favor and blessing of God,
there would be no comparison in the loss?
From-this moment I began to conclude in my mind that
it was possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken,
solitary condition than it was probable 1 should ever have
been in any other particular state of the world; and with
this thought 1 was going to give thanks to God for bring-
in me to this place. I know not what it was, but some-i
thine shocked my mind at that thought, and I durst not
spea the words. How canst thou be such a hypocrite,
said I, even audibly, to pretend to be thankful for a con-
dition, which, however thou mayest endeavor to be con-
tented with, then wouldst rather pray heartily to be de-
livered from? Here I stopped; but though I could not
say I thanked God for being here, yet I sincerely gave

which generally took me up three hours every morning,

considered, that in the middle of the day, when the sun
was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too great to

may judge the labor of my hands in such a piece of work;
but labor and patience carried me through that, and many
other things; 1 only observe this in particular, to show the
reason why so much of my time went away with so little
work, viz., that what might be a little to be done with help
and tools, was a vast labor, and required a prodigious time
to do alone, and by hand. Notwithstanding this, with
patience and labor I went through many things; and, in-
deed, everything that my circumstances made necessary for
me to do, as will appear by what follows,
I was now in the months of November and December,
expecting my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had
manurcd or dug up for them was not great; for, as 1 ob-
served, my seed of each was not above the quantity of half
a peck, having lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry
season; but now my crop promised very' well; when, on a
sudden, I found 1 was in dallgil‘ of losing it all again by
enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce possible to
104 aosrsson causes.
I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay
in it night and. day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so
close, that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk.
I saw no remedy for this, but by making an inclosure
about it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil
and the more because it required speed. However, as my
arable land was but small, suited to my crop, I got it tol-
erably well fenced in about three weeks’ time; and shoot-
ing some of the creatures in the day-time, I'set my dog to
guard it in the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate,
where he would stand and bark all night long; so in a lit-
tle time the enemies forsook the place, and the corn grew
very strong and well, and began to ripen space.
But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was
in the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now,
when it was in the ear; for going along by the place to see
how it throve, 1 saw my little crop surrounded with fowls,

among them (for I always had my gun with me); I had no
sooner shot but there rose up a little cloud of fowls, which
I had not seen at all, from among the corn itself.
This touched me sensiblv, for I foresaw that in afew
days they would devour an my hopes; that I should lie

starved, and nevvr be able to raises crop at all; and what
to do I could not tell; however, I resolved not to lose my
corn, if possible, though I should watch it night and day.

already done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of it;
but that as it was yet too green for them the loss was not
so great, but that the remainder was likely to be a good
crop, if it could be saved.
I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away I
could easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about
me, as if they only waited till 1 was gone away; and the
event proved it to be so; for as I walked off, as if gone, I
was no sooner out of their sight than they dropped down,
one by one, into the corn again. I was so. provoked that I
could not have patience to stay till more came on, know-
ing that every grain they eat now was, as it might be said,
a peck lost! to me in the consequence; so coming up to the

fowls not only never came to the corn, but, in short, they
for-sock all that part of the island, and I could never see a
bird near the place as long as my scare-crows hung there.
This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and about the
' latter end of December, which was our second harvest of
the year, I reaped my com.
I was sadly‘dput to for a scythe or sickle to out it down;
and all I coul do was to make one as well as I could, cut

However, this was great encouragement to me, and I

I 1
neither knew how to grind or make meal of my corn, or
indeed how to clean it and part it; nor if made into meal,
how to make bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I
knew not how to bake it; these things being added to my
desire of having a good quantity for store, and to secure a
constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of this crop,
but to preserve it all for seed against the next season; and,
in the meantime, to employ all my study and hours of
.working to accomplish this great work of providing myself
with corn and bread.
It might be truly said that now I worked for my bread.
It is a little wonderful, and what I believe few people have
thought much upon, viz., the strange multitude of little
things necessary in the providing, producing, curing,

seed-corn which, as 1 have said, came up unexpectedly, and
indeed to a surprise.
First, I had no plow to turn up the earth; n0 spade or
shovel to dig it; well, this I conquered by making a wooden
spade, as I observed before; but this did my work in but a
wooden manner; and though it cost me a great many days
to make it, yet, for want of iron, it not only wore out the
sooner, but made my work the harder, and performed it
much worse. However, this 1 bore with, and was content
to work it out with atience, and bear with the badness of
the performance. hen the corn was sown I had no har-
row, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a great
heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be
called, rather than rake or harrow it. When it was grow-
ing and grown, I have observed already how many things
I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow 0r reap it, cure and
carry it home, thresh, part it from the chaff, and save it;
then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast
and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it; and
yet all these things I did without, as will be observed; and
the corn was an inestimable comfort and advantage to me;
all this, as I said, made everything laborious and tedious to
me, but that there was no help for; neither was my time
so much loss to me, because, as I had divided it, a certain
part of it was every day appointed to these works; and as I
resolved to use none of the corn for bre ad till I had a
greater quantity by me, I had the next six months to apply
myself wholly, by labor and invention, to furnish myself
with utensils proper for performing all the operations nec-

therefore, was not my work, but an assistant to my work;
for now, as I said, I had a great employment upon my

Iwanted much, but knew not where to come at them;

to temper it, to ring it home, and work it, I could not
make above two large earthen ugly things (I can not call
them jars) in about two months’ labor.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard,
I lifted them ver gently up, and set them down again in
two great wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose for
them, that they might not break; and as between the pot
and the basket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed it
tell of the rice and barley straw, and these two pots being
to stand always dry, I thought would hold'my dry corn,
and perhaps the meal, when ‘the corn was bruised.

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers
of such a condition, and that I might fall into the hands of
savages, and perhaps such as I might have reason to think
for worse than the lions and tigers of Africa, that if I once
came in their power, I should run a hazard of more than a
thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of being
eaten; for I had heard that the people of the Carribean
coast were cannibals, or man-eaters; and I knew, by the
latitude, that I could not be far off from that shore.
Then supposing they were not cannibals, yet that they
might kill me, as they had many Europeans who had fallen
into their hands, even when they were ten or twenty
together; much more I, who was but one, and could make
little or no defense; all these things, I say, which I ought
to have considered well of, and did cast up in my thoughts

my head ran mightily upon the thought of getting over to
the shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with
the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a
thousand miles on the coast of Africa: but this was in
vain: then I thought I would go and look at our ship’s
boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the shore a

the boat would have done very well, and I might have gone
back into the Brazils with her easily enough; but I might
have foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her
upright upOn her bottom, than I could remove the island:
however, went to the woods, and cut levers and rollers.
and brought them to the boat, resolving to try what I could
do; suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn her
down, and repair the damage she had received, she would
be a very good beat, and 1 might venture to sea in her.
I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece or fruitless toil,
and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it: at last,

strength, I fell to digging away the sand, to undermine
her, and so as to make her fall down, setting pieces of
wood to thrust and guide her right in the fall. But when
] haddene this, I was unable to stir her up again, or to
get under her, much less to move her forward toward the
water; sol was forced to give it over: and yet, though I
gave over the hopes of the beat, my desire to venture over
the main increased, rather than diminished, as the means
for it seemed impossible. ‘
At length, I began to think whether it was not possible '.
- to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of
those climates make, even without tools, or, as I might
say, without hands, of the trunk of a great tree. 'l‘hisl
not only thought possible, but easy, and pleased myself ex~
tremely with the idea of making it, and with my having
much more convenience for it than any of the Negrws or
Indians; but not at all considering the particular incon-

than all the consequences of want of tools could be to
them: for what could it avail me, if, after I had chosen
my tree, and with much trouble cut it down, and might be
able with my tools to how and dub the outside into the
proper shape of a boat, and burn or out out the inside to
make it hollow, so as to make a boat of it—if, after all
this, I must leave it just where 1 found it, and was not able
to launch it into the water?

upon my mind of my circumstances while I was making

my voyage in it, that I never once considered how 1 should
get it off the land; and it was really, in its own nature,

to have carried me and all my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was extremely
delighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than
ever I saw a canoe or a periagua that was made of one tree,
in my life. Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may be
sure; and there remained nothin but to get it into the
water; which, had I accomplishe , 1 make no question but '
1 should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most un-
likely to be performed, that ever was undertaken. v
But all my devices to get it into the water failed me;
though they cost me inexpressible labor too. It lay about
one hundred yards from the water, and not more; but the

not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I began this

great reluctancy, I was at length obliged to give over also.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too

no ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten
my life; no venomous or poisonous creatures, which I
might feed on to my hurt; no savages, to murder and de-

way, so it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted noth- ‘

things, I went away, and was no more sad.
I had now been here so long, that many things which I
brought on shore for my help were either quite gene, or
very much wasted, and near spent.

times past, I remember that there was a strange concur-
rence of days in the various providences which befell me,
and which, if I had been superstitiously inclined to observe
a days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had reason to have
looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.
First, I had observed, that the same day that I broke
away from my father and my friends, and ran away to
Hull, in order to go to sea, the same day afterward I was
taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and made a slave; the
same day of the year that I escaped out o! the wreck of
the ship in Yarmouth Roads, that same day, years after-
ward, I made my escape from Sallee in the boat: and the
same day of the year I was born on, viz., the 30th of Sep-
tember, that same day I had my life so miraculously saved
twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore in this
island: so that my wicked life and my solitary life began
both on one day.
The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my
bread, 1 mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship:
this I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself
hut one cake of bread a day for above a year; and yet I

My clothes, too, began to decay mightily: as to linen, I
had none for a great while, except some checked shirts
which I found in the chests of the other seamen, and which
1 carefully preserved, because many times 1 could bear no
clothes on but'a shirt, and it was a very great help to me
that I had, among all the men’s clothes of the ship, almost
three dozen of shirts. There were also, indeed, several
thick watchcoats of the seamen’s which were left, but they
were too hot to wear: and though it is true tbatethe
weather was so violently hot that there was no need of
clothes, yet 1 could not go quite naked, no. though I had
been inclined to it, which I was not, nor could I abide the
thought of it, though I was all alone. The reason why I
coul not go uite naked was, 1 could not bear the heat of
the sun so well when quite naked as with some clothes on;
nay, the very heat frequently bllstered my skin: whereas,
with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and whist-
ling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than Without it; No
more could I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the
sun without a cap or hat; the heat of the sun heating with
such violence as it does in that place, would give me the
headache presently, by darting so directly upon my head,
without a cap or hat on, so that I could not bear it,
whereas, it I put on my hat, it would resently go away.
,1, Upon these views, I began to consi er about putting the
few rags I bed, which I called clothes, into some order. 1
had worn out all the waisteoats I had, and my business
was now to try if I could not make jackets out of the great
watch-coats that I had by me, and with such other materials
as I had; so I set to work a-tailoring, or rather, indeed, a
botching, for I made most piteous work of it. However,
1 made shift to make two or three new waistooats, which I
hoped would serve me a great while. As for breeches, or
drawers, ‘1 made but a very sorry shift indeed, till after-

ures that I killed, I mean four-footed ones; and I had

After this I spent a great deal of time and pains to make
me an umbrella; I was indeed in great want of one, and
had a great mind to make one; I had seen them made in
the Brazils, where they were very useful in the great heats

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entire-

myself wholly upon the disposal of His rovidence. This

put an end to that design, and now I thought no more of
it. As I had a beat, my next design was to make a cruise
round the island; for as 1 had been on the other side in
one place, crossing, as I have already described it, over the
land, so the discoveries I made in that little journe made
me very eager tosee other parts of the coast; an new I

a little voyage upon the sea, but never went far out, nor
far from the little creek. At last, being eager to view the
circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved 11 on my
cruise; and accordingly, I victualed my shi for t e voy-
age, utting in two dozen of leaves (cakes should rather
call t cm) of barley bread, an earthen pot full of parched
rice (a food I eat a great deal of), a little bottle of rum,
half a goat, and powder and shot for killing more, and two
large watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned before, I
had saved out of the seamen’s chests; these 1 took, one to
lie upon, and the other to cover me in the night.
It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my
reign, or my ca tivity, which you lease, that set out on
this voyage, an I found it much longer than I expected;
for though the island. itself was not very large, yet when I
came to the east side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks
lie out about two leagues into the sea, some above water,
some under it, and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry
half a league more, so that I was obliged to go a great way
out to sea to double the point.

upon this bill, I believe it Would have been so; for there
was the same current on the other side the island, only
that it set off at a further distance, and I saw there was a
strong eddy under the shore; so I had nothing to do but

an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing
pretty fresh at E.S.E., and that being just contrary to the
said current, made a great breach of the sea upon the
point ,- so that it was not safe for me to keep too close to the
shore, for the breach, nor to go too far cit, because of the
stream. '
The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated
overnight, the sea was calm, and I ventured; but I am a
warning-piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots; for no
sooner was I come to the point, when I was not even my
boat’s length from the shore, but I found myself in a great
depth otwatcr, and a current like the sluice of a mill: it

shore, no mainland or island, for a thousand leagues at
least?
And now I saw how easy it was tor the Providenoe of
God to make even the most miserable condition of man-
kind worse. Now I looked back upon my desolate, solitary
island as the most pleasant place in the world; and all the
happiness my heart could wish for was to be but there
again. 1 stretched out In hands to it, with eager wishes:
Ob, ha py desert! said 1, shall never see thee more. Oh,
misera le creature! whither am I going? Then 1 re-
roaehed myself with my unthankful temper, and how I
18d repined at my solitary condition; and now what would
1 give to be on shore there again! Thus we never see the
true state of our condition till it is illustrated to us by its
coutrsries, nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by
the want of it. It is scarce possible to imagine the con-
sternation lwas now in, being driven from my beloved
island (for so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide
been, almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of
ever recovering it again. However, I worked hard, till in-
deed my strength was almost exhausted, and kept my boat
as much to the northward, that is, toward the side of the
current which the eddy lay on, as possibly 1 could; when
about noon, as the sun assed the meridian, I thought I
felt a little breeze of wind) in my face, springing up from
S. S. E. This cheered my heart a little, and especially when,
in about half an hour more, it blow a pretty gentle gale.
B this time I was got at a frightful distance from the
is and, and had the least cloudy or hazy weather inter-
vened, I had been undone another way too; for 1 had no
compass on board, and should never have known how to
have steered toward the island, if 1 bad but once lost sight
of it; but the weather continuing clear, I applied myself
to get up my mast again, and spread my sail, standing
away to the north as much as possible, to get out of the
current. \
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began
to stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of the. water
some alteration of the current was near; for where the cur-
rent was so strong the water was foul; but perceiving the
water clear, I found the current abate, and presently I
found to the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea
upon some rocks; these rocks I found caused the current

to part again, and as the main strem of it ran away more
southerl , leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the other
returnedy by the repulse of the rocks, and made a strong
eddy, which ran back again to the north-west, with a very
lhar stream.
'1‘ ey who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to
them upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just
going to murder them, or who have been in such-like ex-
tremitie, may guess what my present surprise of joy was,
and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy;
and the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail
to it, running cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong
tide or eddy under foot. '
This eddy carried me about a league in my way back
again, directly toward the island, but about two leagues
more to the northward than the current which carried me

myself 0 n to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the
other on of the island, opposite to that whichI went out
from.
When I had made something more than a league of way
by the help of this current or eddy, 1 found it was s eat,
and served me no further. ‘ However, 1 found that eing

which had hurried me away, and that on the north, which
lay about a lea no on the other side; I sa , between these
two, in the waie of the island, I found t e water at least
still, and running no way; and having still a breeze of wind
fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the island,
though not making such fresh way as I did before.
About four o’clock in the evening, being then within a
league of the island, I found the point of the rocks which
ncvasioned this disaster stretching out, as is described be-

southerly, had, of course, made another eddy to the north;
and this 1 found very strong, but not directly setting the
way my course lay, which was due west, but almost full
north. However, having a fresh gale I stretched across
this eddy, slanting north-west; and in about an hour came
within about a mile of the shore, where, it being smooth
water, I soon get to land. ‘
When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God
thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all
'M
_i. __ ,V,_ w
thou hts ‘of deliverance by my boat; and refreshing
myse f with such things as I had, 1 brought my boat close
to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied under some
trees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with
the labor and fatigue of the voyage.
' I was now at a great loss which way to get home with
my boat; I had run so much hazard, and knew too much
of the case, to think of attempting it by the way 1 went
out; and what might be at the other side (I mean the west
side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more
ventures; so I only resolved in the morning to make m
way westward along the shore, and see if there was no cree
where I mi ht lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have
her again, i I wanted her. In about three miles, or there-
about, coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet or
bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till it came to a.
very little rivulet or brook, where I found a very conveni-
ent harbor for my boat, and where she lay as if she had
been in a little dock made on purpose for her. Here I put
in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore,
to look about me, and see where I was. '
I soon found 1 had but a little passed by the place where
I had been before, when I traveled on foot to that shore;
so taking nothing out of my boat but my gun and um-
brella, for it was exceeding hot, I began my march. The
way was comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had '
been upon, and I reached my old bower in ,the evening,
where found everything standing as I had left it; for I
always kept it in good order, being, as I said before, my
country-house.
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to
rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep; but

upon the danger I had been in. 1 would have been very
glad to have had my boat again on my side of the island;
but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about. As
to the east side of the island, which I had gone round, I
knew well enough there was no venturing that way; my
very heart would shrink, and my very blood run chill, but
to think of it; and as to the other side of the island, 1 did
not know how it might be there, but supposing the current
ran with the same force against the shore at the east as it
passed by it on the other, I might run the same risk of be-
ing driven down the stream, and carried by the island, as
Ihad been before of being carried away from it; so, with
these thoughts, I contented myself to be without any boat,
though it had been the product of so many months’ labor
to make it, and of so many more to get it into the sea.
In this government of my tem er I remained near a
year, lived a very sedate, retired li e, as you may well sup-
pose; and my thoughts being very much composed, as to
my condition, and (fully comforted in resignin myself to
the dispositions of Providence, I thought I liv really very
happily in all things, except that of society.
I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic ex-
ercises which my necessities put me upon applying myself
to; and I believe I could, upon occasion, have made a Very
good carpenter, especially considering how few tools I had.

He rears a Flock of Goats—His Dairy.——His Domestic Habits and
Style of Living—Increasing Prosperity.
BEING now in the eleventh year of my residence, and as
I have said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to
study some art to trap and snare the goats, to see whether
I could not catch some of them alive; and particularly, I
wanted a she-goat great with young. For this purpose I
made snares to hamper them; and I do believe they were
more than once taken in them; but my tackle was not
good, for I had no wire, and 1 always found them broken,
and my bait devoured. At length I resolved to try a pit-
fall ; so I dug several large pits in the earth, in places where
I had observed the goats used to feed, and over those pits I
placed hurdles, of my own making too, with a great wei ht
upon them; and several times I put ears of barley and ry
rice, without setting the trap; and 1 could easily perceive
that the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn, for 1
could see the marks of their feet. At length I set three
traps in one night, and going the next morning, 1 found
them all standing, and yet the bait eaten and gone. This
was very discouraging; however, I altered my traps, and,
not to trouble you with particulars, going one morning to
see my traps, 1 found in one of them a large old he-goat,
and in one of the others three kids, a male and two females.

I wanted; I could have killed him, but that was not my
business, nor would it answer my end; so 1 even let him
out, and he ran away, as if he had been frightened out of
his wits. But 1 had forgot then what I learned after-
ward, that hunger will tame a lion. If I had let him stay
there three or four days without food, and then have car.
/ ried him some water to drink, and then a little corn, he
would have been as tame as one of the kids; for they are
mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they are well
used. However, for the present I let him go, knowing no
better at that time; then LWQI'E tg_ the three kids, and

the tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild
when they grew up; and the only way for this was, to have
some inclosed piece of ground, well fenced, either with

there was likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for

Those who understand such inclosures will think I had
very little contrivance, when I pitched upon a place very
proper for all these (being a plain open piece of meadow
and, or savanna, as our people call it in the western col-
onies) which had two or three little drills of fresh water in
it, and at one end was very woody; I say, they will smile
at my forecast, when I shall tell them, I began my inclos-
ing this piece of ground in such a manner that my hedge
or pale must have been at least two miles about. Nor was
the madness of it so great as to the compass, for if it was
ten miles about, I was like to have time enough to do it in;
but I did not consider that my goats would be as wild in
so much compass as if 'they had had the whole island, and
I should have so much room to chase them in, that

deed, in the beginning, I did not so much as think of, and
which, when it came into my thoughts, was really an agree-
able surprise; for now I set up my dairy, and had some—
times a gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature,

naturally how to make use of it, so I, that had never

and miscarriages, made me both butter and cheese at last,
and also salt (though I found it partly made to my hand
by the heat of the sun upon some of the rocks of the sea),
and never wanted it afterward. How mercifully can our
Creator treat His creatures, even in those conditions in
which they seemed» to be overwhelmed in destruction!
How can He sweeten the bitterest providences, and give us
cause to praise him for dungeons and prisons! What a

It would have made a stoic smile to have seen me and
my little family sit down to dinner. There was my
majesty, the prince and lord of the whole island; I had the
lives of all my subjects at my absolute command; I could
hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away; and no rebels
among all my subjects.

species to multiply his kind upon, sat always at my right

on the other, expecting now and then a bit from my hand,

too much._ .
1 was something impatient, as I have observed, to have
the use of my boat, though very loath to run any more
hazards; and therefore sometimes I sat contrivina' ways to
get her about the island, and at other times I sat myself
down contented enough without her. But I had a strange
uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the
island, where, as I have said, in my last ramble, I went up
the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the current set,
that 1 might see what I had to do: this inclination in-
creased upon me every day, and at length I resolved to
travel thither by land, following the edge of the shore. 1

one side, and one on the other. I had another belt, not so
broad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung over
my shoulder; and at the end of it, under my left arm,
hung two pouches, both made of goat’s skin too: in one of
which hung my powder, in the other my shot. At my
back I carried my basket, and on my shoulder my gun;

had about me, next to my gun. As for.my face, the color

went over the land, a nearer way, to the same height that
I was upon before; when looking forward to the point of
the rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to double
with my boat, as is said above, I was surprised to see the
sea all smooth and quiet; no'rippling, no motion, no cur-
rent, any more than in any other places. I was at a
strange loss to understand this, and resolved to spend some
time in observing it, to see if nothing from the sets of
the tide had occasioned it; but I was presently convinced
how it was, viz., that the tide of ebb, setting from the i.
west, and joining with the current of waters from some
great river on the shore: must be the occasion of this cur-
rent; and that according as the wind blew more forcibly
from the west, or from the north, this current came nearer,
or went further from the shore: for waiting thereabouts
till evening, I went up to the rock again, and then the
tide of ebb being made, 1 plainly saw the current again as
before, only that it ran further 01f, being near half a league y
from the shore; whereas, in my case, it set close upon the i
shore, and hurried me and my canoe along with it, which,
at another time, it would not have-done.
This observation convinced me, that I had nothing to do

- I might very easily bring my boat about the island again:
but when I began to think of putting it in practice, I had
such a terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the
danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again
with any patience; but, on the contrary, I took up another
resolution, which was more safe, though more laborious;
and this was, that I would build, or rather make me
another periagua or canoe; and so have one for one side of
the island, and one for the other.

I'r happened one day, about noon, going toward m

naked foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen
in the sand. I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had
seen an apparition: I listened, I looked round me, but_ I
could hear nothing, nor see anything; I went up to a us-

any more, and to observe if it might not be my fancy; but
there was no room for that, for there was exactly the print
of a foot, toes, heel, and every part of a foot: how it came-

I» I slept none that night: the further I was from the occa-'
sion of my fright, the greater my apprehensions were;
which is something contrary to the nature of such things,
and especially to the usual practice of all creatures in fear;
but I was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas of
the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations
to myself, even though I was now a great way 01f it.
Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil, and reason
joined in with me upon this supposition; for how should
any other thing in human shape come into the place?
Where was the vessel that brought them? What marks
were there of any other footsteps? And how was it possi-
ble a man should come there? But then to think that
Satan should take human shape upon him in such a place,
where there could be no manner of occasion for it, but to
leave the print of his foot behind him, and that even for
no purpose too, for he could not be sure I should see it--

and with all the notions we usually entertain of the sub-
tlety of the devil.
Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me
out of all apprehensions of its being the devil; and I pres-
ently concluded, then, that it must be some more danger-
ous creature, viz., that it must be some of the savages of
the main land over against me, who had wandered out to
sea in their canoes, and, either driven by the currents or
by contrary winds, had made the island, and had been on

more resolution. ,

myself, 1 concluded that this island, which was so exceed-
ing pleasant, fruitful, and no further from the main land
than as I had seen, was not so entirely abandoned as I
might imagine; that although there were no stated inhabit-

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my

sticks, of the osier-like wood, which 1 found so apt to
grow, as they could well stand; insomuch, that I believe I
might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a
- pretty large space between them and my wall, that I might
have room to see an enemy, and they might have no shelter
from the young trees, if they attempted to approach my

perfectly impassable; and no men, of what kind soever,
would ever imagine that there was anything beyond it,
much less a habitation. As for the way which I proposed
to myself to go in and out (for I left no avenue,) it was by
setting two ladders, one to a part of the rock which was
low, and then broke in, and left the room to place another

ladder upon ' that: so when the two ladders were taken
down, no man living could come down to me without do-
ing himself mischief; and if they had come down, they
were still on the outside of my outer wall.
Thus I took all the measures human prudence could
suggest for my own preservation; and it will be seen, at
length, that they were not altogether without just reason,
though I foresaw nothing at that time mere than my more
fear suggested to me. ' , >

tired parts of the island; and I pitched upon one, which
was as private, indeed, as my heart could wish for: it was
a little damp piece of ground, in the middle of the hollow
and thick woods, where, as is observed, 1 almost lost my-
self once before, endeavoring to come‘ back that way from
the eastern part of the island. Here I found a clear piece
of land, near three acres, so surrounded with woods that
it was almost an i'nclosure by nature; at least, it did not
want near so much labor to make it so as the other pieces
of ground 1 had worked so hard at, ‘ -

this piece; and when they were there, I continued to per-
fect the fence, till 1 had made it as secure as the other,
which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up
more time by a great deal. All this labor 1 was at the ex-
pense of purely from my apprehensions on account of the
print of a man’s feet which I had seen; for, as yet, I never
saw any human creature come 'near the island; and 1 had
now lived two years under this uneasiness, which, indeed,
made my life much less comfortable than it was before, as
may be well imagined by any who know what it is to live
in the constant snare of the fear of man. And this I must
observe, with grief too, that the disoomposure of my mind
had too great impressions also upon the religious part of
my thoughts: for the dread and terror of falling into the
hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that
I seldom found myself in a due temper for application to '
my Maker, at least not with the sedate calmness and resig-
nation of soul which 1 was wont to do: I rather prayed to
148 ' nonmsou causoai
rounded with danger, and in expectation every 111 ht of
being murdered and devoured before morning; and must
testify from my experience, that a temper of peace, thank-
fulness, love and affection, is much the more proper frame
for prayer than that of terror and discomposure; and that
under the dread of mischief impending, a man is no more
148 ' nonmsou causoai
God, than he is for a repentance on a sick-bed; for these
148 ' nonmsou causoai
and the discomposure of the mind must necessarily be as
great a disability as that‘of .the body, and much greater:

praying to God being properly an act of the mind, not
of the body.
But to go on: after I had thus secured one part of my
little living stock, I went about the whole island, searching
for another private place to make such another deposit;
when, wandering more to the west point of: the island than
I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I thought I
saw a boat upon the sea, at a great distance. I had found
_ a perspective glass or two in one of the seamen’s chests,
which I saved out of our ship, but I had it not about me;
and this was so remote, that I could not tell what to make
of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able to
hold to look any longer: whether it was a boat or not, I do
not know, but as 1 descended from the hill 1 could see no
more of it; so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more
out without a perspective glass in my pocket. When 1
was come down the hill to the end of the island, where, in-
deed, 1 had never been before, I was presently convinced
that the seeing the print of a man’s 'foot was not such a
trange thing in the island as I imagined: and, but that it
was a special providence that l was cast upon the side of
the island where the savages never came, I should easily
have known that nothing was more frequent than for the
canoes from the main, when they happened to be a little
too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island
for harbor: likewise, as they often met and fought in their
canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners, would
bring them over to this shore, where, according to their
dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and
eat them; of which hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said
above, being the south-west point of the island, 1 was per-
fectly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible for me to
express the horror of my mind, at seeing. the shore spread
with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies;
and, particularly, 1 observed a place where there had been

where I supposed the savage wretches had sat down to
their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fellow-

entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for
a long while: all my apprehensions were buried in the

thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and
the error of the degeneracy of human nature, which,
though I had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a
view of before: in short, I turned away my face from the
horrid spectacle; my stomach grew sick, and I was just at
the point of fainting, when nature discharged the disorder
from my stomach: and having vomited with uncommon
violence, 1 was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay
in the place a moment; so 1 got me up the hill again with
all the speed 1 could, and walked on toward my own habi-
tation.
When 1 came a little out of that part of the island, L

though I had esteemed my present condition very miser-

could suffer. I
In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle,
and began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my
circumstances, than ever I was before: for I observed that

they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not

thing to their purpose. I knew I had been here now
almost eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps of
human creature there before; and I might be eighteen
years more as entirely concealed as 1 was now, if I did not
discover myself to them, which I had no manner of occa-
sion to do; it being my only business to keep myself en-
tirely concealed where 1 was, unless I found a better sort
of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to. Yet
lentertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches
that I have been speaking of, and 0f the wretched inhu-
man custom of their devouring and eating each other up,
\
that I continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my
own circle, for almost two years after this; when I say my
own circle,l mean by it my three plantations, viz., my
‘ castle, my country seat, which 1 called my bower, and my
inclosure in the woods: nor did I look after this for any
other use than as an inclosure for my goats; for the aver-
sion which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was
such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing the
devil himself. I did not so much as go to look after my
boat all this time, but began rather to think of making me
another; for 1 could not think of ever making any more
attempts to bring the other boat round the island to me,
test 1 should meet with some of these creatures at sea, in
which if I happened to have fallen into their hands, I
knew what would have been my lot.
Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that 1 was in
no danger of being discovered by these peo le, began to
wear off my uneasiness about them; and I egan to live
just in the same composed manner as before, only with
this difference, that I used more caution, and kept my eyes
more about me, than I did before, lest 1 should happen to

out of the ship, I always carried them out with me, or at

also furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I had out
of the ship, and made me a belt to hang it on also; so that
I was now a most formidable fellow to leak at when I went
abroad, if you add to the former description of myself, the
particular of two istols, and a great broadsword hanging
at my side in a be t, but without a scabbard.

As in my present\ condition there were not really many
things which I wanted, so, indeed, I thought that the

in, which was a thing that, as I had observed already, 1
could never compass; no, though I spent not only many
days, but weeks, nay, months, in attempting it, but to no

eep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to
make it boil; and yet, with all these t ings wanting, I
verily believe, had not the frights and terrors l was in
about the savages intervened, 1 had undertaken it, and
perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave anything
over without accomplishing it, when once 1 had it in my-
head to begin it. But my invention now ran quite another
way; for, night and day, I could think of nothing but how
I might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel,
bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the victim they
should bring hither to destroy. It would take up a large
volume than this whole work is intended to be, to set down
all the eontrivances 1 hatched, or rather brooded upon, in
my thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at least
frightening them so as to prevent their coming hither any
more; but all this was abortive; nothing could be possible
to take effect, unless I was to be there to do it myself; and

about the size of pistol-bulllts; and the fowling-piece I loaded
with near a handful of swan-shot, of the largest size: I also
loaded my pistols with about four bullets each; and in this
posture, well provided with ammunition for a second and
third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition.
After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and, in
my imagination, put it in practice, I continually made my
tour every morning up to the top of the hill, which was
from my castle, as I called it, about three miles, or more,
to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea, coming
vnear the island, or standing over toward it: but I began to
tire of this hard duty, after I had, for two or three months,
constantly kept my watch, but came always back without
any discovery: there having not, in all that time, been the
least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but on the
whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses could reach every t
way. _
As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out,1
so long also I ke it up the vigor of my design, and my
spirits seemed to e all the while in‘a suitable form for so
outrageous an execution as the killing twenty or thirty
naked savages, for an offense, which I had not at all en-
tered into a discussion of in my thoughts, any further than

to act such horrid things, and receive such dreadful cus-

Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy; could
have run them into. But now, when, as I have said, I
began to be weary of the fruitless excursion, which I had
made so 1011 and so far every morning in vain, so my
opinion of tie action itself began to alter; and lbegan,
with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what I was

with myself, thus: How do I know what God Himself
judges in this particular case? It is certain these people

tians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners
taken in battle; or more frequently, upon many occasions,
put whole troops of men to the sword, without giving
quarter, though they threw down their arms and "submit-
ted. In the next place, it occurred to me, that although
the usage they gave one another was thus brutish and in-
human, yet it was really nothing to me; these peo le had
done me no injury: that if they attempted me, or saw it
necessary, for my immediate preservation, to fall upon
them, something might be said for it; but that I was "wet

and that the rooting them out of the country is spoken of

who were without principles of tenderness, or the common

kind of a full sto ; and I began, by little and little, to be

ures in my resolution to attack the savages; and that it

to prevent; but that if 1 were discovered and attacked b
them, I knew my duty. On the other hand, I argued wit
myself, that this really was the way not to deliver myself,
but entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was
sure to kill every one that not only should be on shore at
that time, but that should ever come on shore afterward,
if but one of them escaped to tell their country-people
what had happened, they would come over again by thou-
sands torevenge the death of their fellows, and I should
only bring upon myself a 'certain destruction, which, at
present, I had no manner of occasion for. Upon the
whole, ll concluded, that neither in principle nor in policy
I ought, one way or other, to concern myself in this affair;
that my business was, by all possible means, to conceal
myself from them, and not to leave the least signal to them
to guess by that there were any living creatures upon the
island, I mean of human shape. Religion joined in with;
this prudential resolution, and I was convinced now, many?
ways, that I Was perfectly out of my duty when I was lay-
ing all my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent
creatures, I mean innocent as to me. As to the crimes
they were guilty of toward one another, 1 had nothing to
do with them; they were national, and I ought to leave
them to the justice of God, who is the Governor of na-
tions, and knows how, by national punishments, to make
a just retribution for national offenses, and to bring public
judgments upon those who offend in a public manner, by
such ways as best please Him. This appeared so clear to
me now that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me than
that I had not been suffered to_d0 a thing which 1 now saw
so much reason to believe would have been no less a sin
than that of willful murder, if I had committed it; and I
gave most humble thanks on my knees to God, that had
thus delievered me from blood-guiltiness; beseeching Him
to grant me the protection of His Providence, that I might
' not fall into the hands of the barbarians, or that I might
not lay m hands upon them, unless I had a more clear
. call from eaven to do it, in defense of my own life.

SEGTIONV XIX.
Robinson discovers a Cave, which serves him as a Retreat against
the Savages.
IN this disposition 1 continued for near a year after this;
and so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon
these wretches, that in all that time I never once went up
the hill to see whether there were any of them in sight, or
to know whether any of them had been on shore there or
not, that I might not be tempted to renew any of my con-
trivances against-them, or be provoked, by any advantage
which might present itself, to fall upon them; only this I
did, I went and removed my boat, which I had on the
other side of the island, and carried it down to the east end
of the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove, which
1 found under some high rocks, and where I knew, by rea-
son of the currents, the savages durst not, at least would
not, come with their boats upon any account whatever.
With my boat I carried away everything that I had left
there belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare
going thither, viz., a mast and sail which I had made for
her, and a thing like an anchor, but which, indeed, could
not be called either anchor or grapnel; however, it was the
best I could make of its kind; all these I removed, that
there might not be the least shadow of any discovery, or
any appearance of any boat, or of any human habitation,
upon the island. Besides this, I kept myself, as I said,
more retired than ever, and seldom went from my cell,
other than upon my Constant employment, viz., to milk
nosmsou cnusox. 155
which, as it was quite on the other part of the island, was
quite out of danger; for certain it is, that these savage peo-

never wandered off from the coast; and I doubt not but
they might have been several times on shore after my ap-
PI‘LhOHSlOIIS of them had made me cautious, as well as be-

or twenty savages, and found them pursuing me, and by
the swiftness of their running, no possibility of my escap-
ing them? The thoughts (E this sometimes sunk my very
soul within me, and distressed my mind so much that I
could not soon recover it, to think what I should have
done, and how 1 should not only have been unable to resist
them, but even should not have had presence of mind
enough to do what I might have done, much less what
now, after so much consideration and preparation, I might
be able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking on these
things, I would be very melancholy, and sometimes it would
last a great while; but I resolved it all at last, into thank-
fulness to that Providence which had delivered me from so
many unseen dangers, and had kept frmn me those mis—
chiefs which 1 could have no way been the agent in deliver-
ing myself from, because 1 had not the least notion of any
such thing depending, or the least supposition of its being
possible. This renewed a contemplation which often ha

see the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers we
run through in this life; how wonderfully we are delivered
when we know nothing of it; how, when we are in a quan-

way, or that way, a secret hint shall direct us this way,
when we intended to go that way; nay, when sense, our

rule with me, that whenever I found these secret hints or
pressings of mind, to doing or not doing anything that
presented, or going this way or that way, I never failed to
obey the secret dictate; though I knew no other reason for
it than that such a pressure, or such a hint, hung upon
my mind. I could give many examples of the success of
this conduct in the course of my life, but more especially
in the latter part of myinhabiting this unhappy island, be-
sides many occasions which it is very likely I might have
taken notice of it, if 1 had seen with the same eyes then
that I see with now. But it is never too late to be wise;
and I can not but advise all considering men, whose lives
are attended with such extraordinary incidents as mine, or
even though not so extraordinary, not to slight such secret
intimations of Providence, let them come from what invisi-
ble intelligence they will. That I shall not discuss, and
perhaps can not account for; but certainly they are a proof
of the converse of spirits, and a‘secret communication be-
tween those embodied and those unembodied, and such a
proof as can never be withstood; of which 1 shall have oe-
casion to give some very remarkable instances in the re-
mainder of my solitary residence in this dismal place.
I believe the reader of this will not think it stran e if I
confess that these anxieties, these constant danger lived
in, and the concern that was new upon me, put an end to

who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.
The.mor.th of this hollow was at the bottom of a great
rock, where by mere accident (I would say, if 1 did not see

reason of my making this charcoal, which was thus: 1 was

but I was almost as much frightened as I was before; for I
heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain,
and it was followed by a broken noise, as of words half ex-
pressed, and then a deep sigh again. 1 stepped back, and
was indeed struck with such a surprise, that it put me into
a cold sweat; and if I had had a hat on my head, I will not
answer for it, that my hair might not have lifted it off.
But still plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and en-

and presence of God was everywhere, and was able to pro-

I saw lying on the ground a most monstrous, frightful, old
he-goat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping for
life, and dying, indeed, of mere old age. I stirred him a
little to see if I could get him out, and he essayed to get
up, but was not able to raise himself; and I thought with
myself he might even lie there; for if he had frightened
me, so he would certainly frighten any of the savages, if
any of them should be so hardy as to come in there while
he had any life in him. .'
I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look
round me, when 1 found the cave was but very small, that
is to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in no man-
ner of shape, neither round nor square, no hands having
ever been employed in making it but those of mere Nature.
I observed also that there was a place at the further side of
it that went in further,~but was so low that it required me
to creep upon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither
it went I knew not; so having no candle, I gave it over for
that time, but resolved to come again the next day, pro-

now of goat’s tallow, but was hard set for candle-wick,
usin sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and sometimes the
drie rind of a weed like nettles); and going into this low
place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours, as I have said,
almost ten yards; which, by the way, I thought was a
venture bold enough, considering that I knew not how far
it might go, nor what was beyond it. When I had got

Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, l hap-

the sea, and which had, been wet; and I found t at the
water had penetrated about three or four inches into the
powder on every side, which caking and growing hard, had
preserved the inside like a kernel in the shell; so that 1 had
near sixty pounds of very good powder in the center of the
cask; this was every agreeable discovery to me at that
time; so I carried all away thither, never keeping above
two or three pounds of owder with me in m castle, for
fear of a surprise of any ind; I also carried thither all the

I found expiring, died in the mouth of the cave the next

some time continually driving them from me, and letting

the weather by this time being perfectly clear, could
plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wrec of a ship, cast

found when I was out in my boat; and which rocks, as
they checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind
of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my re-
covering from the most desperate, hopeless condition that
ever I had been in in all my life. Thus, what is one man’s

and the rocks being wholly under water, had been driven

First, I imagined/ that upon seeing my light, they might

and carried them off; other times I fancied they were all

the current that I had been formerly in, were carried out
into the great ocean, where there was nothing but misery
and perishing; and that perhaps, they might by this time

that the Providence of 0d casts us into any condition of
lite so low, or any misery so great, but we may see some-
thing or other to be thankful tor, and may see others in
worse circumstances than our own. Such certainly was
the case of these men, of whom I could not so much as see
room to suppose any of them were saved; nothing could
make it rational so much as to wish or expect that they did
not all perish there, except the possibility only of their be-
ing taken up by another ship in company; and this was
but mere possibility indeed, for I saw not the least sign or
appearance of any such thing. I can not explain, by any
possible energy of words, what a strange longing or han-
ering of desires I felt in my soul upon this sight, break-

THERE are some secret moving s rings in tho affections
which, when they are set a-going y some object in view,
or, though not in view, yet rendered present to the mind
by the power of imagination, that motion carries out the
soul, by its impetuosity, to such violent, eager embracings
of the object that the absence of it is insupportable. Such
were these earnest wishings (that but one man had been

reason and manner of them; all I can say to them is to
describe the fact, which was even surprising to me, when
I found it, though I knew not from whence it proceeded;
it was doubtless the effect of ardent wishes, and of strong
ideas formed in my mind, realizing the comfort which the
conversation of one of my teller/“Christians would have

had nothing in his pockets but two pieces-of-eight and a

' did not altogether press me so much as the possibility that
there-might be yet some living creature on board, whose
life I might not only save, but might, by saving that life,
comfort my own to the last degree. And this thought
clung so to my heart that I could not be quiet night or day,
but 'I must venture out in my boat on board this wreck;
and committing the rest to God’s Providence, I thought
the impression was so strong upon my mind that it could
not “be resisted, that it must come from some invisible
direction, and that I' should be wanting to myself if 1 did
not go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to
my castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took a
quantity .of bread, a great pot of fresh water, a compass to
steer by, a bottle of rum (for 1 had still a great deal of
that left), and a basket of raisins; and thus loading myself
with everything necessary, I went down to my boat, got

was a great bag of rice, the umbrella to set up over my
head for a shade, another large pot of fresh water, and
about two dozen of my small leaves, or barley~cak_es, more
than before, with a bottle of goat’s milk and a cheese; all
which, with great labor and sweat, 1 carried to my boat,
and praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out; and
rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore, came at last
to the utmost point of the island on the north-east side.
And now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either to
venture or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents
which ran constantly on both sides of the island at a dis-
tance, and which were very terrible to me, from the re-
membrance of the hazard I had been in before, and. my
heartbegan to fail me; for I foresaw that if 1 was driven
into either of these currents 1 should be carried a great
way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach, or sight of
the island again; and that, then, as my boat was but
small, if any little gale of wind should rise, 1 should be
inevitably lost.
Thpse thoughts so oppressed my mind that I began to
give oyer my enterprise; and having hauled my boat into
a little creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat me down
upon a rising bit of ground, very pensive and anxious, be-
tween fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was

south side had done before, so as to take from me all gov-

addle, I went at a great rate directly for the wreck, and
1n less than two hours I came up to it. It was a dismal
sight to look at; the ship, which, by its building, was
Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two rocks; all the
stern and quarter of her were beaten to pieces with the sea;

several chests, which I believed belonged to some of the

two chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a great

course she steered, she must have been bound from
Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of
America, beyond'the Brazils, to the Havanna, in the Gulf
of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt,
a great treasure in her, but of nouse, at that time, to any-

evening, about an hour within night, 1 reached the island
again, weary and fatigued to the last degree. I reposed
that night in the boat; and in the morning I resolved to
harbor what I had got in my new cave, and not carry it
home to my castle. After refreshing myself, 1 got all my

cargo on shore, and began to examine the particulars.
The cask of liquor 1 found to be a kind of rum, but not
such as we had at the Brazils, and, in a word, not at all
good; but when I came to open the chests, I found several
things of great use to me; for example, 1 found in one a

found two pots of very good succades or sweetnieats, so
fastened also on the top, that the salt-water had not hurt
them; and two more of the same, which the water had
spoiled. I found some very good shirts, which Were very
welcome to me; and about a dozen and a half of white
linen handkerehiefs and colored neck-cloths; the former
were also very welcome, being exceeding refreshing to wipe
my face in a hot defy. Besides this, when 1 came to the

of-eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in all;
‘and in one of them, wrapped up in a paper, six doubloons
of gold and some small bars or wedges of gold; I suppose
they might all weigh near a pound. In the other chests
were some clothes, but of little value; but, by the circum-
stances, it must have belonged to the gunner’s mate;

whole, 1 got very little by this voyage that was of any use

poorer man than the other, which seemed to belong to
some officer. Well, however, I lagged this money home

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured
them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her
along the shore, to her old harbor, where I laid her up,
and made the best of my way to my old habitation, where
I found everything safe and quiet. I began now to repose
myself, live after my old fashion, and take care of my
family affairs; and, for awhile, I lived easy enough, only

in for so many years in this very island, and how I had
walked about in the greatest security, and with all possible
tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing but the brow of a
bill, a great tree, or the casual approach of night, had
been between me and the worst kind of destruction, viz.,
that of falling into the hands of cannibals and savages,
who would have seized on me with the same view as I
would on a goat or a turtle, and have thought it no more
a crime to kill and devour me than I did a pigeon or cur~

was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose
singular protection I acknowledged, with great humility,
all these unknown deliverances were due, and without
which I must inevitably have fallen into their merciless
hands.
When these thoughts were over, my head was for some
time taken up in considering the nature of these wretched
creatures, I mean the savages, and how it came to ass in
the world, that the wise Governoipf all things shcu d give

up any of His creatures to such inhumanity, nay, to some:
thing so much below even brutality itself, as to devour its .
own kind; but as this ended in some (at that time) fruit-
less speculations, it occurred to me to inquire what part of
the world these wretches lived in; how far off the coast was
from whence they came; what they ventured over so far
from home for; what kind of boats they had; and why I.
might not order myself and my business so, that I might
be as able to go over thither as they were to come to me. (
I never so much as troubled myself to consider what 1
should do with myself when I went thither, what would,
become of me, if I fell into the hands of the savages; or
how I should escape from them, if they attacked me: no,\
nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach the;
coast, and not be attacked by some or other of them, with-I
out any possibility of delivering myself; and if I should not
fall into their hands, what I should do for provision. or:
whither I should bend my course: none of these thoughts;
I say, so much as came in my way; but my mind was
wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in my boat
to the main land. I looked upon my present condition as
the most miserable that could possibly be; that I was not
able to throw myself into anything, but death, that could
be called worse; and if I reached the shore of the main, I
mi ht perhaps meet with relief, or 1 might coast alon , as
I did on the African shore, till I came to some iuha ited

perhaps,'I might fall in with some Christian ship that
might take me in; and if the worst came to the worst, 1
could but die, which would put an end to all these miseries
at once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed
mind, an impatient tem er, made desperate, as it were, by
the long continuance o my troubles, and the disap oint-
ments I had met in the wreck I had been on board of: and
where I had been so near obtaining what 1 so earnestly
longed for, viz., somebody to speak to, and to learn some
knowledge from them of the place where I was, and. of the
robable means of my deliverance. I was agitated wholly
y these thoughts: all my calm of mind, in my resignation
to Providence, and waiting the issue of the dispositions of
Heaven, seemed to be suspended; and I had, as it were. no
power to turn my thoughts to anything but to the project
of a voyage to t 0 main. which came upon me wit sash

be resisted. »
When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or
more, with such violence that it set my very blood into a
ferment, and my pulse beats as if I had been in a fever,
merely with the extraordinary fervor of my mind about
it, nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhallsted with
the very thought of it, threw me into a sound sleep. _One
would have thought I should have dreamed of it, but I did

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion: that my
only way to go about to attempt an escape was, if possible,
to get a savage into my possession; and, if possible, it

to be eaten, and should bring hither to kill. But these

SECTION XXII.
Robinson Rescues one of Their Captives from the Savages, Whom he
names Friday, and makes his Servant.
ABOUT a year and a half after 1 entertained these notions
(and by long musing had, as it were, resolved them all into
nothing, for want of an occasion to put them into execu-
tion), I was surprised, one morning early, with seeing no

island, and the people who 'belonge to them all landed,
and out of my sight. The number of them broke all my
measures; for seeing so many, and knowing that they
always came four or six, or sometimes more, in a boat, I
could not tell What to think of it, or how to take my meas-
ures, to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; so lay
still in my castle, perplexed and discom orted: however, I
put myself into all the same postures for an attack that I
had formerly provided, and was just ready for action, it
anything had presented. Having waited a good while, list-
ening to hear if they made any noise, at length, being very
impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and
clambered up to the top of the hill, by my two stages, as
usual; standing so, however, that my head did not appear
above the hill, so that they could not perceive me by any
means. Here 1 observed, by the help of my perspective
glass, that they were no less than thirty in number; that

How they had cooked it Igknew not, or what it was; but
they were all dancing, in I know notv how many barbarous

‘While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, ‘by my
perspective, two miserable wretehes dragged from the
cats, where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now
brought out for the slaughter. 1 perceived one of them
immediately fall, beirgg knocked down, I suppose, with a
club or wooden sword, for that was their way, and two or
three others were at_wogkwimmediately, cutting him open

for their cookery, while the other victim was left standing
by himself,.till they should be ready ‘for him. In that very
moment, this poor wretch seeing himself a little at liberty,
and unbound, nature inspired him with hopes of life, and
he started away from them, and ran with incredible swift-
ness along the sands, directly toward me, I‘ mean toward
that part of the coast where my habitation was. 1 was
dreadfully frightened, I must acknowledge, when I per-
ceived him run my way, and especially when, as I thought,
I saw him pursued by the whole body: and now 1 expected
that art of my dream was coming to pass, and that he
would) certainly take shelter in my grove; but 1 could not
depend, by any means, upon my dream for the rest of it,
viz., that the other savages would not pursue him thither,
180 IOBINSON causes.
I irits began to recover, when I found t at there was not
above three men that followed him; and still more was 1
encouraged when I found that he outstripped them exceed-
ingly in running, and gained ground of them, so that if he
could but hold it for half an hour, I saw easily he would
fairly get away from them all.
There was between them and my castle the creek, which

landed my cargoes out of the ship; and this 1 saw plainly
he must necessarily swim over, or the poor Wretch would
be taken there: but when the savage escaping came
thither, he made nothing of it, though the tide was then
up; but plunging in, swam through in about thirty strokes,
or thereabouts, landed, and ran on with exceeding strength
and swiftness.‘ When the three persons came to the creek,
I found that two of them could swim, but the third could
not, and that, standing on the other side, he looked at the
others, but went no further, and soon after went softly
back again; which, as it happened, was very well for him
in the end. I observed, that the two who swam were yet
more than twice as long swimming over the creek as the

upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was
the time to get me a servant, and perhaps a companion or
instant, and that I was called plainly by Providence to
love this poor creature’s life. I immediately ran down the
ladders wrth all possible expedition, fetched my two guns,
k My were both at_ngth_g.‘foqt of the ladders, as I observed
above, and getting up again, with the same haste, to the
top of the hill, I crossed toward the sea, and having a very
short cut, and all down hill, placed myself in the way be-

come forward, which he easily understood, and came a
little way; then stopped again, and then a little further,
and stopped again; and I could then perceive that he stood
trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just
been to be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned to
him again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of en-
couragement that 1 could think of; and he came nearer
and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in
token of acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at
him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come
still nearer: at length he Came close to me; and then he
knelt down again, kissed the ground, and laid his head
upon the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my foot
upon his head: this, it seems, was in token of swearing to
be my slave forever. 1 took him up, and made much of
him, and encouraged him all I could. But there was more
work to do yet; for I perceived the savage whom I knocked
down was not killed but stunned with the blow, and began

the savage, that he was not dead: upon this he spoke some
words to me, and though I could not understand them, yet

down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the
ground, and 1 perceived that my savage began to be afraid;
but when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the
man, as if I would shoot him: upon this my savage, for so
I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my
sword which hung naked in a belt by my side, which I did.
He no sooner had it, but he ran to his enemy, and, at one
blow, cut off his head so cleverly, no executioner in Ger- _
many could have done it sooner or better; which I thought
very strange for one who, I had reason to believe, never
saw a sword in his life before, except their own wooden
swords: however, it seems, as I learned afterward, they
made their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood
Ihas so hard, that they will cut off heads even with them, ay
and arms, and that at one blow too. When he had done
this, he came ladghing to me, in sign of triumph, and
brought me the sword again, and with abundance of gest-
ures, which I did not understand, laid it down, with the
head of the savage that he had killed, just before me. But
that which astonished him most was to know how I killed
the other Indian so far 05: so pointing to him, he made
signs to me to let him go to him; so 1 bade him go, as well
as I could. When he came to him, he stood like one

then on the other, looked at the wound the bullet had

made a hole, and novgreat quantity of blood had followed,
but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead. He took
up his bow and arrows, and came back; so 1 turned to go
away, and beckoned him to follow me, making signs to
him that more might come after them. Upon this, he
made signs to me that he should bury them with sand,
that they might not be seen by the rest, if they followed;
and so [made signs to him again to do so. He fell to
work; and, in an instant, he had scraped a hole in the

then dragged him into it, and covered him; and did so by
the other also: I believe he had buried them both in a
quarter of an hour. Then calling him away, I carried
him, not to my castle, but quite away, to my cave, on the
further part of the land : so I did not let my dream come

shelter. Here 1 gave him bread and a bunch of raisins
to eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was in-
deed in great distress for, by his running; and having re-
freshed him, I made signs for him to go and lie down to
deep, showing him a place where I had laid some rice
straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon
myself sometimes; so the poor creature lay down, and went
to sleep.
He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made,
with straight, strong limbs, not too large, tall, and well-
shaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age.

face; and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of a
European in his countenance too, especially when he
smiled. His hair was long and black, not curled like
wool; his forehead very high and large; and a great vivac-
aty and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The color of his
skin was not quite black, but very tawny; and yet not an
ugly yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Virgin-
lans, and other natives of America are, but of a bright kind
of a dun olive color, that had in it something very agree-

After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an .

I had been milking my goats, which 1 had in the inclosure

was very good for him. I kept there with him all that

it, and beckoned with my hand to him to come away, which
he did immediately, with great submission. 1 then led him
up to the top of the hill, to see if his enemies were gone;
and pulling out my lass, I looked, and saw- plainly the
place where they had een, but no appearance of them or,

had left their two comrades behind them, wit out any
search after them. v

to get some fuller intelligence of them. When 1 came to

to feast upon; that three of them were eaten up, and that
he, pointing to himself, was the fourth; that there had
been a great battle between them and their next king,
whose subjects, it seems, he had been one of, and that they
had taken a great number of prisoners; all which were car-

as my skill would allow (for l was now grown a tolerable

might do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that
with wonder, that however it had pleased God, in His

creatures the best uses to which their faculties and the

how mean a use we make of all these, even though we have

who, if I might judge by this poor savage, would make a
much better use of it than we did. From hence, I some-
times was led too far, to invade the sovereignty of Provi-
dence, and as it were arraign the justice of so arbitrary a
disposition of things, that should hide that light from
some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty

AFTER I had been two or three days returned to my

his horrid way of feeding, and from the relish of a canni-
bal’s stomach, I ought to let him taste other flesh; so I
took him out with me one morning to the woods. 1 went,
indeed, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock, and
bring it home and dress it; but as I was going, I saw a sh:-
goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids sitting
y her. 1 catched hold of Friday: Hold, said I; stand
still; and made signs to him not to stir: immediately I
presented my piece, shot, and killed one of the kids. The
poor creature, who had, at a distance, indeed, seen me kill
the savage, his enemy, but did not know, nor could imag-
ine, how it was done, was sensibly surprised, trembled and
shock, and looked so amazed, that I thought he would have
sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot at, or perceive
I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat, to feel whether
he was not wounded, and, as I found presently, thou ht I
was resolved to kill him: for he came and knelt own
to me, and embracing my knees, said a great many things
I did not understand; but 1 could easily see the meaning
was, to pray me not to kill him. ,7 M-
I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him
no harm; and taking him 11 by the hand, lau hed at him,
and pointing to the kid whic 1 had killed, bec oned to him
to run and fetch it, which he did; and while he was won-
dering and looking to see how the creature was killed, I
loaded my gun again. By and by, I saw a great fowl, like
a hawk, sitting upon a tree, within shot; so, to let Friday
understand a little what 1 would do, I called him to me
again, pointed at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot,
though I thought it had been a hawk; I say, ointing to
the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground) under the
parrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made him
understand that I would shoot and kill that bird: accord-

the parrot fall. He stood like one frightened again, not-
withstanding all I had said to him; and I found he was the
more amazed, because he did not see me put anything into
the gun, but thought that there must be some wonderful
fund of death and destruction in that thing, able to kill
man, beast or bird, or anything near or far OE; and the
astonishment this created in him was such, as could not
wear off for a long time; and I believe, if I would have let
him, he would have worshiped me and my gun. As for
the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it for several
days after; but he would speak to it, and talk to it, as it
it had answered him, when he was by himself; which, as I
afterward learned of him, was to desire it not to kill him.

place where she fell: however, he ound her, took her up,
and brought her to me; and as I had rceived his igno-
rance about the gun before, I took this vantage to charge
the gun again, and not to let him see me do it, that I
might be ready for any other mark that might present;
but nothing more oifered at that time: so I brought home
the kid, and the same evening 1 took the skin off, and out

pose, l boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some
very good broth. After I had begun to eat some, 1 gave
some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it
very well: but that which was strangest to him, was to see
me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the salt
was not good to eat; and putting a tittle into his mouth,
he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it,
washing his mouth with fresh water after it: on the other
hand, I took some meat into my mouth without salt, and
I pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast as
he had done at the salt; but it would not do; he would never
care for salt with his meat or in his broth; at least, not for
a great while, and then but very little.
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was
resolved to feast him the next day with roasting a piece of

glad to hear.
The next day 1 set him to work to beating some corn
out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as Iobserved
before; and he soon understood how to do it as well as I,
especially after he had I seen what the meaning of it was,
and that it was to make bread of it: for after that I let
him see me make my bread, and bake it too; and in a lit-
tle time Friday was able to do all the work for me, as well
as I could do it myself.
I began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed
instead of one, 1 must provide more ground for my harvest,
and plant a larger quantity of corn than I used to do: s0 1
marked out a larger piece of land, and began the fence in
the same manner as before, in which Friday worked not
only very willin ly and very hard, but did it very cheer-
fully: and 1 tol him what it was for; that it was for corn
to make more bread, because he was now with me, and
that 1 might have enough for him and myself too. He ap-
peared very sensible of that art, and let me know that he
thought I had much more abor upon me on his account
than I had for myself; and that he would work the harder
for me, if 1 would tell him what to do.
This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this
place. Friday began to ta k pretty well, and understand
the names of almost everything I had occasion to call for,
and of every place I had to send him to, and talked a great
deal to me; so that, in short, I began now to have some,
use for my tongue again, which, indeed, I had ver little
occasion for before, that is to say, about speech. esides '
the pleasure of talking to him, 1 had a singular satisfaction
in the fellow himself: his simple, unfeigned honesty ap-
peared to me more and more every day, and I began really
to love the creature; and, on his side, I believe he loved
in? more than it was possible for him ever to love anything
e ore.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclin-
ation for his own country again; and having taught him
English so well that he could answer me almost any ques‘

tion, I asked him whether the nation that he belonged to
never conquered in battle? At which he smiled, and said,

be taken prisoner then, Friday?
Friday: My nation beat much, for all that.
Master: How beat? If your nation beat them, how
came on to be taken?
Fri ay: They more many than my nation in the place
where me was; they take one, two, three, and me; my na-
tion overheat them in the yonder place, where me no was;
there my nation take one, two, great thousand.
Master: But why did not your side recover you from the
hands of your enemies, then.
Friday: They run one, two, three, and me, and make go
in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that time.
Master: Well, Friday, and what does ,your nation do
with the men they take? Do they carry them away and
eat them, as these did?
Friday: Yes, my nation eat mans too; eat all up.
Master: vWhere do they carry them?
Friday: Go to other place, where they think.
Master: Do they come hither? .
1Friday: Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else
p ace.
Master: Have you been here with them?
Friday: Yes, I have been here; (points to the north-west
side of the island, which, it seems, was their side).
By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly
been among the savages who used to come on shore on the
further part of the island, on the same man-eating occa—
sions he was now brought for: and some time after, when _
v I took the courage to carry him to that side, being the same
I formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and
told me he was there once when they eat up twenty men,
two women, and one child: he could not tell twenty in
English, but he numbered them, by laying so many stones
in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over.
I have told this passage, because it introduces what fol-
lows, that after I had this discourse with him, I asked him
how far it was 1mm 1 island to the shore, and whether


the canoes were not often lost. He told me there was no
danger, no canoes ever lost; but that, after a little way out
to sea, there was a current and wind, always one way in
the morning, the other in the afternoon. This 1 under-
stood to be no more than the sets of the tide, as going out
or coming in; but I afterward understood it was occa-
192 nonmson canson.
Oroonoko, in the mouth or gulf of which river, as I found
afterward, our island lay; and that this land which I per-
ceived to the west and north- west was the great island Trin-
idad, on the north point of the mouth of the river. I asked
Friday a thousand questions about the country, the inhab-
itants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were near: he
told me all he knew, with the greatest openness imagin-
able. I asked him the names of the several nations of his
sort of people, but could get no other name than Caribs:
from whence 1 easily understood, that these were the Car-
ibbees, which our maps place on the part of America which
reaches from the mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guinea,
and onward to St. Martha. \ He told me that up a great
way beyond the moon, that was, beyond the setting of the
moon, which must be west from their country, there dwelt
white bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great whisp
kers, which I mentioned before; and that they had killed
much mans, that was his word: by all which I understood,
he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had
been spread over the whole country, and were remembered
by all the nations, from father to son.
I inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this
island and get among those white men: he told me, Yes,
yes, you may go in two canoe. I could not understand
what he meant, or make him describe to me what he meant

meant it must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes.
This part of Friday’s discourse began to relish with me very
well; and from this time 1 entertained some hopes that,
192 nonmson canson.
my escape from this place, and that this poor savage might
be a means to help me. ,
During the long time that Friday had now been with me,
and that he began to speak to me, and understand me, I
was not wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge
in his mind: particularly I asked him, one time, who made
0
him! The poor creature did not understand me at all, but
thought I had asked him who was his father; but I took it
up by another handles, and asked him who made the sea,
the ground we walked on, and the hills and woods? He
told me, it was one old Benamuckee, that lived beyond all;
he could describe nothing of this great person, but that he
was very old, much older, he said, than the sea or the land,
than the moon or the stars. I asked him then, if this old
person had made all things, why did not all things worship
him? He looked very grave, and with a perfect look of
innocence said, All things say oh to him. I asked him if
the people who die in his country went away anywhere?
He said, Yes; they all went to Benamuckee: then I asked
grim whether these they eat up went thither too? He said,
. es.
From these things I began to instruct him in the knowl-
edge of the true God: I told him that the great Maker of
all things lived up there, pointing up toward heaven; that
He governed the world by the same power and providence
by which He made it; that He was omnipotent, and could
do everything for us, give everything to us, take every-
thing from us; and thus, by degrees, 1 opened his eyes.
He listened with great attention, and received with pleasure
the notion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of
the manner of making our prayers to God, and His being
able to hear us, even in heaven. He told me one day, that
if our God could hear us up beyond the sun, He must needs
be a greater God than their Benamuckce, who lived but a
little way off, and yet could not hear till they went up to
the great mountains where he dwelt to speak to him. I
asked him if ever he went thither to speak to him? He
said, No; they never went that were young men: none
went thither but the old men, whom he called their
Oowokakee; that is, as 1 made him explain it to me, their
religious, or clergy; and that they went to say oh (so he
' called saying prayers), and then came back, and told them
what Benamuckee said. By this I observed that there is
priestcraft even among the most blinded, ignorant pagans
1n the world; and the policy of making a secret of religion,
in order to preserve the veneration of the people to the
clergy, is not only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps
amon all reli ions in the world, even among the most
brutii and bar aroas savages.
I endeavored to clear up this fraud to my man Friday;
and told him, that the pretense of their old men going up
to the mountains to say oh to their god Benarnuckee was a
cheat; and their bringing word from thence what he said
was much more so; that if they met with any answer, or
spoke With any one there, it must be with an evil spirit;
and then I entered into a long discourse with him about
the devil, the original of him, his rebellion against God,
his enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting himself up
in the dark parts of the world to be worshiped instead of
God, and as God, and the many stratagems he made use of
$0 delude mankind to their ruin; how he had a secret ac~
case to our passions and to our affections, and to adapt his
snares to our inclinations, so as to cause us even to be our
own tempters, and run upon our destruction by our own
choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his
mind about the devil, as it was about the being of a God:
nature assisted all my ar uments to evidence to him even
the necessity of a great %‘irst Cause and overruling, gov-
erning Power, a secret, directing Providence, and of the
equity and justice of paying homage to Him that made us,
and the like; but there appeared nothing of this kind in
the notion of an evil spirit; of his origin, his being, his
nature, and, above all, of his inclination to do evil, and to
draw us in to do so too: and the poor creature puzzled me
once in such a manner, by a question merely natural and
innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I had
been talking a rest deal to him of the power of God, His
omnipotence, is aversion to sin, His being a consuming
194 nonmson causes.
He could destroy us an all the world in a moment; and
he listened with great seriousness to me all the while. After
this, I had been telling him how the devil was God’s enemy
in the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill to
defeat the good designs of Providence, and to ruin the
kin dom 01 Christ in the world, and the like. Well, says
Fri ay, but you say God is so strong, so rest; is He not -
much strong, much might as the devil?— es, yes, says 1.
Friday, God is stronger than the devil: God is above the
devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him down
under our feet, and enable us to resist his temptations, and
194 nonmson causes.
O
stronger, much might as the devil, why God no kill the
devil, so make him no more do wicked? I was strangely
surprised at this question; and, after all, though I was
now an old man, yet I was but a young doctor, and ill

hear him, and asked him what he said; but he was too
earnest for an answer to forget his question, so that he re-
peated it in the very same broken words as above. By this
time I had recovered myself a little, and 1 said, God will
at last punish him severely; he is reserved for the judg-
ment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell

that offend Him? We are preserved to repent and be par-
doned. He mused some time on this. Well, well, says
he, mighty affectionately, that well: so you, ], devil, all
Wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all. Here I was
run down again by him to the last degree; and it was a
testimony to me, how the mere notions of nature, thou h
the will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge 0 a
Go , and of a worship or homage due to the supreme being
of God, as the consequence of our nature, yet nothin but
divine revelation can form the knowledge of Jesus 0 rist,

God’s throne: 1 say, nothing but a revelation from Heaven
can form these in the soul; and that, therefore, the gospel

from the word of God, as his conscience might be convinced,
his eyes Opened, and his soul saved. When he came again
to me, I entered into a long discourse with him upon the
subject of the redemption of man by the Saviour of the
world, and of the doctrine of the ospel preached from
heaven, viz., of repentance toward rod, and faith in our
blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him, as well as 1
could, why our blessed Redeemer took not on Him the
nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham; and how, for
that reason, the fallen angels had no share in the redemp-
tion; that He came only to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel, and the like.

that either I did not know, or had not fully considered be‘

1 had more affection in my inquiry after things upon this
occasion than ever I felt before: so that, whether this poor

I continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of
my time; and the conversation which employed the hours
between Friday and me was such as made the three years
which we lived there together perfectly and completely
happy, 11 any such thing as complete happiness can be
formed in a sublunary state. This savage was now a good

myself, in reading the Scriptures, to let him know, as well
as I could, the meaning of what 1 read; and he again, by
his serious inquiries and questionings, made me, as I said before, a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge
than I should ever have been by my own mere private read-

knowledge of God, and of the doctrine of salvation by
Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the word of God,
so easy to be received and understood, that, as the bare
reading the Scripture made me capable of understanding
enough of my duty to carry me directly on to the great
work of sincere repentance for my sins, and laying hold of
a Saviour for life and salvation, to a stated reformation in
practice, and obedience to all God’s commands, and this

had the sure guide to heaven, viz., the Word of God; and
we had, blessed be God, comfortable views of the S irit of
God teaching and instructing us by HIS Word, lea ing us
into all truth, and making us both willing and obedient to
the instructions of His Word. And 1 can not see the least
use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points of
religion, which have made such confusions in the world,
would have been to us, if we could have obtained it. But
I must go on with the historical part of things, and take
eyery part in its order.

AFTER Friday and I became more intimately acquainted,
and that he could understand almost all I said to him, and
198 EOBINSON causes.
ac uainted him with my own history, or at least so much
of it as related to mycoming to this place; how I had lived
here, and how long; I let him into the mystery, for such
it was to him, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him
how to shoot. I gave him a knife, which he was wonder-
fully delighted with, and I made him a belt with a frog
han ing to it, such as in England we wear hangers in; and
in t e frog, instead of a hanger, 1 gave him a hatchet,
which was not only as good a weapon, in some cases, but
much more useful upon other occasions.
I described to him the country of Europe, particularly
England, which I came from; how we lived, how we wor-
shiped God, how we behaved to one another, and how we
traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave him an
account of the wreck which I had been on board of, and
showed him, as near as I could, the place where she lay;
but she was all beaten in pieces before, and gone. I
# showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when I
escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole strength
then; but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon see-
ing this boat, Friday stood musing a great while, and said
nothing. I asked him what it was he studied upon? At
last, says he, Me see such boat like come to place at my
nation. 1 did not understand him a good while; but at
last when I had examined, further into it, I understood by
him, that a boat, such as that had been, came on shore
upon the country where he lived; that is, as he explained
it, was driven thither by stress of weather. I resently
imagined that some European ship must have con east
away upon their coast, and the boat might get loose, and
drive ashore; but was so dull that I never once thought of
men making their Qreseape from a wreck thither, much less
in

whence they might come; so I only inquired after a de-
scri tion of the boat.
riday described the boat to me well enough; but
brought me better to understand him when he added, with
some warmth, We save the white mans from drown. Then
1 presently asked him if there were any white mans, as he
called them, in the boat. Yes, he said; the boat full of
white mans. I asked him how many. He told me upon

them. He told me, They live, they dwell at my nation.
This put new thoughts into my head, for I presently im-
agined that these might be the men belonging to the ship
that was cast away in the sight of my island, as I now called
it; and who, after the ship was struck on the rock, and
they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their
boat, and were landed upon that Wild shore among the sav-
ages. Upon this, 1 inquired of him more critically what
was become of them; he assured me they lived still there;
that they had been there about four years; that the sav-
ages let them alone, and gave them victuals to liv’e on. I
asked him how it came to pass they did not kili them, and
eat them? He said, N 0, they make brother with them;
that is, as I understood him, a truce; and .then he added,

It was after this some considerable time that, being
upon the to of the hill, at the east side of the island, from
whence, as have said, I had, in a clear day, discovered.

and, in a kind of surprise, falls a jum ing and dancing,
and calls out to me, for 1 was at some istance from him.
I asked him what was the matter. Oh, joy, as s he! oh,
glad! there see my country, there my nation! Iobserved
an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his face, and
his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a strange
eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his own country
again. This observation of mine put a great many thoughts

man Friday as I was before; and I made no doubt but that
if Friday could get back to his own nation a sin, he would
not only forget all his religion, but all his ob igation to me,
and would be forward enough to give his countrymen an
account of me, and come back perhaps with a hundred or
two of them, and make a feast upon me, at which he
might be as merry as he used to be With those of his
enemies, when they were taken in war. But I Wronged
the poor honest creature very much, for which I was very
sorry afterward. However, as my jealousy increased, and
held me some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and
not so familiar and kind to him as before; in which I was
certainly in the wrong too; the honest, grateful creature
having no thought about it, but what consisted with the
best rinciples, both as a religious Christian, and as a
grate ul friend, as appeared afterward to my full satisfac-
tion.
While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was
every day pumping him, to see if he would discover any of
the new thoughts which I suspected were in him; but I
found everything he said was so honest and so innocent,
300 nonmsou causes.
spite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his
own again; nor did he, in the least, perceive that I was
uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit.
One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather be-
ing hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I
called to him and said, Friday, do not you wish yourself in
your own country, your own nation? Yes, he said, I be
much oh, glady, to be at my own nation. What would
you do there? said 1; would you turn wild again, eat men’s

again. Why, then, said I to him, they will kill you. He
looked grave at that, and then said, No, no; they no kill
me, they willing love learn. He meant by this they would
be willing to learn. He added, they learned much of the
bearded mans that came in the boat. Then I asked him it
he would go back to them. He smiled at that, and told
me that he could not swim so far. I told him I would
make a canoe for him. He told me he would go, if I

if I come there. No, no, says he; me make they no eat

tell them how 1 had killed his enemies and saved his life,
and so he would make them love me. Then he told me,
as well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen white
men, or bearded men, as he called them, who came on
shore there in distress.
From this time I confess I had a mind to venture over,
and see if I could possibly join with those bearded men,
who, 1 made no doubt, were Spaniards and Portuguese;

to escape from thence, being upon the continent, and a
good company together, better than I could from an island
forty miles off the shore, and alone, without help. So,
after some days, 1 took Friday to work again, by way of
discourse, and told him 1 would give him a boat to go back
to his own nation; and accordingly I carried him to my
frigate, which lay on the other side of the island, and hay-
ing cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk in water)
I brought it out, showed it him, and we both went into it.
I found he was a most dexterous fellow at'managing it,
and would make it go almost as swift again as I could.
So when he was in I said to him, Well, now, Friday, shall
we go to your nation? He looked very dull at my saying
' so; which, it seems, was because he thought the boat too
small to go so far; I then told him 1 had a bigger; so the

said that Was big enough; but then, as I had taken no cars
of it, and it had lain two or three-and-twenty years there,
the sun had split and dried it, that it was in a manner rot-

him we would go and make one as big as that, and he
should go home in it. He answered not one word, but
looked very grave and sad. I asked him what was the
matter with him. He asked me again, Wh you angry
mad with Friday? What me done? I asked im what he
meant. I told him I was not angry with him at all. No
angry? says he, lepeating the words several times. Why
send Friday home away to my nation? Why, says I, Fri-
day, did not you say you wished you were there? Yes, yeah
says he, wish be both there; no wish Friday there, no mas
ter there. In a word, he would not think of going there
without me. I go there, Friday! says I; what shall I do
there? He returned very quick upon me at this: You do
great deal much good, says be, you teach wild mans be
good, sober, tame mans; you tell them know God, pray
0d, and live new life. Alas! Friday, says I, then kiiowest . ‘
not what thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man. myself.
Yes, yes, says he, you teaches me good, you teaches them
good. No, no, Friday, says I, you shall go without me;

looked confused again at that word; and running to one of
the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily,
and gives it to me. What must I do with this? says I to
him. You take "l Friday, says he. What must I kill
you for? said 1 again. He returns very quick: What you
send Friday away for? Take kill Friday, no send Friday
away. i This he spoke so earnestly, that 1 saw tears stand
in his eyes; in a word, 1 so plainly discovered the utmost

I told him then, and often after, that I would never send
him away from me, if he was Willing to stay with me.
Upon the whole, as I found, by all his discourse, a set-

from me, so I found all the foundation of his desire to go

which, as I had no notion of myself, so I had not the
‘ least thought, or intention, or desire of undertaking it.
But still 1 found a strong inclination to my attempting an

the discourse, viz., that there were seventeen bearded men

large vessels; but the main thing I looked at was, to get
one so near the water that we might launch it when it was

Friday itched upon a tree, for I found he knew much

I tell, to this day, what wood to call the tree we cut down,

except that it was very like the tree we call fustic, or be-
tween that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the
same color and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow
or cavity of this tree out, to make it for a boat, but 1
showed him how to cut it with tools, which, after 1 had
showeddzim how to use, he did very handily; and in about

some; especially when, with our axes, which I showed him
how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true
shape of a boat. After this, however, it cost us near a
fortnight’s time to get her along, as it were, inch by inch,
upon great rollers, into the water; but when she was in
she would have carried twenty men with great case.
When she was in the water,'and though she was so big,
it amazed me to see with what dexterity, and how swift my
man Friday would manage her, turn her, and paddle her
along. So I asked him if he would, and if we might vent-
ure over in her. Yes, he said; we venture over in her
very well, though great blow wind. However, 1 had a
further design, that he knew nothing of, and that-was to

cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get, so I
pitched upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I found
near the place, and which there were great lenty of in the
island; and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave
him directions how to shape and order it. But as to the
sail, that was my particular care. ‘I knew I had 01d sails,
or rather pieces of old sails, enough; but as I had had them
now six-and-twenty years by me, and had not been very
careful to preserve them, not im ining that I should ever
have this kind of use for them, did not doubt but they
were all rotten, and, indeed, most of them were so. How-
ever, I found two pieces, which ap ared pretty good, and
with these I went to work; and wit a great deal of pains,
and awkward stitching, you may be sure, for want of
needles, I at length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like
what we call in England a shoulder-ofamutton sail, to go
with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top,
such as usually our ship’s long-boats sail with, and such as
1 best knew how to manage, as it was such a one I had to

steer with. I was but a bungling shipwright, yet, as I
knew the usefulness, and even necessity of such a thing, I
applied myself with so much pains to do it, that at last I
brought it to pass; though, considering the many dull con-
trivances 1 had for it that failed, I think it cost me almost
as much labor as making the boat.
After all this was done, I had my man Frida to teach
as to what belonged to the navigation of my host; for,
though he knew very well how to paddle a canoe, he knew
nothing what belonged to a sail and a rudder, and was the
most amazed when he saw me work the boat to and again

this way, or that way, as the course we sailed changed; 1
say, when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and
amazed. However, with a little use, I made all these
things familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, ex-
cept that, as to the compass 1 could make him understand
very little of that. On the other hand, as there was very
little cloudy weather, .and seldom or never any fogs in
those parts, there was the less occasion for a compass, see-
ing the stars were always to be seen by night, and the
shore by day, except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody
cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea. E
I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of m
captivity in this place; though the three last years thatI
had this creature with me ought rather to be left out of
the account, my habitation being quite of another kind
than in all the rest of the time. I kept the anniversary of

and the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily
delivered; for I had an invincible impression upon my

with my husbandry; digging, planting, and fencing, as
usual. I gathered and cured my grapes, and did every
. necessary thing as before. ,

The rainy season was, in the meantime, upon me, when
I kept more within doors than lat other times. We had
stowed our own vessel as secure as we could, bringing her
up into the creek, where, as 1 said in the beginning, I
landed my rafts from the ship; and hauling her up to the
shore, at high-water mark, I made my man Friday dig a
little dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep

when the tide was out, we made a strong dam across the

that felt not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on;
and before I had time to speak to him, he cries out to me,
Oh, master! oh, master! oh, sorrow! oh, bad! What’s
the matter, Friday? says I. Oh, yonder, there, says he,
one, two, three canoe; one, two, three! By this way of
speaking, I concluded there were six; but, on inquiry, I
found it was but three. Well, Friday, says I, do not be
frightened! So I heartened him up as well as I could;
however, 1 saw the poor fellow was most terribly seared;
for nothing ran in his head but that they were come to look
lor him and would cut him in pieces and eat him; and the
poor fellow trembled so that 1 scarce knew what to do with
him. 1 comforted him as well as 1 could, and told him I
was in as much danger as he, and that they would eat me
as well as him. But, says 1, Friday, we must resolve to
lnoemsou causes. 205
but there come many great number. No matter for that,
said I, again; our guns will fright them that we do not kill.
So I asked him whether, if I resolved to defend him he
would defend me, and stand by me; and do just as I bid
him. He said, Me die when you bid die, master. So I
went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him; for I
= had been so good a husband of my rum, that I had a great
’ deal left. When he drank it, I made him take the two
fowling-pieces, which we always carried, and loaded them

took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs and

brace of bullets each; I hung my great sword, as usual,
naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet. When I
had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective glass, and
went up to the side of the hill, to see what I could dis- .
cover; and I found quickly, by my glass, that there were
one-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes;
and that their whole business seemed to be the triumphant
banquet upon these three human bodies; a barbarous feast
indeed! but nothin more than, as I had observed, Was
usual with them. I observed also that they were landed,
not where they had done when Friday made his escape, but
nearer to my creek; where the shore was low, and where a
thick wood came almost close down to the sea. This, with
the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came

had charged, as be ore, between us; I gave Friday one is-

and I took one pistol, and the other three guns myself;
and in this posture we marched out. I took a small bottle
of}, rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with
more powder and bullets; and, as to orders, I charged him
to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do
anything, till I bid him; and in the meantime not to speak
a word. In this pgslngg 1 fetched a compass to my right

glass it was easy to do. w a,
While I was making this march, my former thoughts re-
turning, I began to abate my resolution; I do not mean
that I entertained any fear of their number; for, as they
were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was superior
to them; ay, though I had been alone. But it occurred
to my thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what
necessity 1 was in, to go and dip my hands in blood, to
attack pegple who had neither done nor intended me any
wrong? ho, as to me, were innocent, and whose bar-
barous customs were their own disaster; being, in them, a

take the cause into His own hands, and, by national venge-

that, m the meantime, it was none of my business; that, it
was true, Friday might justify it, because he was a declared
enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular
pee le, and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I
coud not say the same with respect to myself. These
things were so warmly pressed u on my thoughts 'all the
way as 1 went, that I resolved Ip would only go and place
myself near them, that I might observe their barbarous
feast, and that I would act then as God should direct; but
that, unless something offered that was more a call to me
than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with them.
With this resolution I entered the wood; and, with all
ossible wariness and silence, Friday following close at my
eels, I marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on
the side which was next to them, 'only that one corner of
the wood lay between me and them. Here I called softly
to Friday, and showing him a reat tree, which was just at
the corner of the wood, I b e him go to the tree, and

at his feet. I turned to Friday—Now, Friday, said 1, do
as 1 bid thee. Friday said he would. Then, Friday, says
I, do exactly as you see me do, fail in nothing. So I set
down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon the
ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with the other
musket I took my aim atFthe savages, bidding him to do
the like: then asking him if he was ready, he said, Yes.

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the
side that he shot, he killed two of them, and wounded thret
more; and on my side I killed one, and wounded two.
They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation;
and all of them who were not hurt jumped upon their feet,
but did not immediately know which way to run, or which
way to look, for they knew not from whence their destruc-

we found only two drop, but so many were wounded that
they ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures,
all bloody, and most of them miserably wounded, whereof
three more fell quickly after, though not quite dead.
Now, Friday, says I, laying down the discharged pieces,
and taking up the musket which was yet loaded, follow me;
which he did,with a great deal of courage; u n which I
rushed out of the wood, and showed mysel , and Frida

Latin, Christianus; but was so weak and faint that he could
scarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket,
and gave it him, making signs that he should drink, which
he did; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he eat.
Then I asked him what countryman he was: and he said,
Espagnol; and being a little recovered, let me know, by
all the signs he could possibly make, how much he was in

to speak to him, and tell him of his deliverance; and,
pulling out my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a
dram; which, with the news of his being delivered, revived
him, and he sat up in the boat. But when Friday came to
hear him speak, and look in his face, it would have moved
any one to tears to have seen how Friday kissed him, em-
braced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped
about, danced, sung; then cried again, wrung his hands,
beat his own face and head; and then sung and jumped
about again, like a distracted creature. It was a good
while before I could make him speak to me, or tell me
what was the matter; but when he came a little to him-

and out of the boat, a. great many times: when he went in
to him, he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold
his father’s head close to his bosom for many minutes to-

which were numbed and stiff with the binding, and chafed
and rubbed them with his hands; and I, perceivrng what

little, I called him to me, and he came jum ing and laugh-

if he had given his father any bread. He shook his head,
and said, None; ugly dog eat all up self. I then gave him
a cake of bread, out of a little pouch which I carried on
purpose; I also gave him a dram for himself, but he would
not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in my
ocket two or three bunches of raisins, so I gave him a
handful of them for his father. He had no sooner given
his father these raisins, but I saw him come out of the
boat, and run away, as if he had been bewitched, he-ran at
such a rate; for he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that
ever I saw: I say, he ran at such a rate, that he was out
of sight, as it were, in an instant; and though I called,
and hallooed out too, after him, it was all one, away he
went; and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come back
again, though not so fast as he went; and as he came
nearer, 1 found his pace slacker, because he had some-
thing in his hand. When he came up to me, I found that
he had been quite home for an earthen jug or pet, to bring
his father some fresh water, and that he had two more
cakes or leaves of bread ;_the bread he gave me, but the
water he carried to his father; however, as I was verv
thirsty too, I took a little sup of it. The water revived
his father more than all the rum or spirits 1 had given him,

him quite in, he set himself close to his father; and pres-

though the wind blew pretty hard too: so he brought them
both safe into our creek, and leaving them in the boat,

spoke to him, and asked him whither he went. He told
me, Go fetch more boat: so away he went like the wind,

neither of them able to walk, so that poor Friday knew not
what to do.
To remedy this, 1 went to work in my thought, and call-

came to me, I soon made a kind of a hand-barrow to lay
them on, and Friday and I carried them both up together

handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above that with
boughs of trees, being in the space without our outward
fence, and between that and the grove of youn wood which
I had planted; and here we made them two eds of such
l
things as 1 had, viz. of good rice straw, with blankets laid
upon it, to lie on, and another to cover them, on each bed.

whole country was my own more property, so that I had an
undoubted right of dominion. Secondly, my people were
perfectly subjected; I was absolutely lord and law-giver;
they all owed their lives to me, and were ready to lay
down their lives, if there had been occasion for it, for me.
It was remarkable, too, I had but three subjects, and they
were of three different religions: my man Friday was a
Protestant, his father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and
the Spaniard was a Papist: however, I allowed liberty of
conscience throughout my dominions. But this is by the

the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the language of
the savages pretty well.

him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which

must of necessity be drowned, or driven south to those
other shores, where they were as sure to be devoured

but, as to what they would do, if they came safe

that they were so dreadfully frightened with the man'-

In a little time, however, no canoes appearing, the tear
of their coming wore off; and I began to take my former
thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration; being
likewise assured, by Friday’s father, that 1 might depend
upon good usage from their, nation, on his account, it I,
would go. But my thoughts were a little suspended when
I had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I
understood that there were sixteen more of his countrymen
and Portuguese, who, having been cast away, and made
their escape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with
the savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries,
and indeed for life. I asked him all the particulars of their

I asked him what he thought would become of them
there, and if they had formed no design of making any
escape. He said they had many consultations about it;
but that having neither vessel, nor tools to build one, nor
provisions of any kind, their councils always ended in
tears and despair. I asked him how he thought they
would receive a proposal from me, which might tend to-
ward an escape; and whether it they were all here, it
might not be done. I told him with freedom, I feared
mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if 1 put my
life in their hands, for that gratitude was no inherent virt-
ue in the nature of man, nor did men always sq'uare their
dealings by the obligations they had received, so much as
they did by the advantages they expected. I told him it
would be very hard that I should be the instrument of
their deliverance, and that they should afterward make
me their prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman

accident soever brought him thither; and that I had rather
be delivered up to the savages, to be devoured alive, than
to-fall into the merciless claws of the priests, and be car-
tied into the Inquisition. I added, that otherwise I was
ersuaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many
ands, build a bark large enough to carry us all away,
either to the Brazils, southward, or to the islands, or the
Spanish coast, northward; but that if, in requittal, they
should, when I had put weapons into their hands, carry
me by force among their own people, I might be ill used
for my kindness to them, and make my case worse that it
was before. '
He answered with a great deal of candor and in nuous~
sees, that their condition was so miserable, and t ey were
so sensible of it, that he believed they would abhor the
thought oi! using any man unkindly that should contribute
to their deliverance; and that, if 1 pleased, he would go to
them with the old man, and discourse with them about it,
and return again, and bring me their answer; that he would
make conditions with them upon their solemn oath, that
they should be absolutely under my leading, as their com-
mander and captain; and that they should swear, upon the
hol sacraments and gospel, to be true to me, and go to
sue Christian country as that 1 should agree to, and no
other, and to be directed wholly and absolutely by my orders,
till they were landed safely in such country as I intend-
ed; and that he would bring a contract from them, under
their hands, for that purp0se. Then he told me that he

from me as long as he lived, till I gave him orders; and
that he would take my side to the last drop of his blood,
if there should happen the least breach of faith among his
countrymen. He told me they were all of them very civil,
honest men, and they were under the greatest distress im-
aginable, having neither weapons, nor clOthes, nor any food,
but at the mercy and discretion of the savages; out of all
hopes of ever returning to their own country; and that he
was sure, if 1 would undertake their relief, they would live
and die by me.
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve
them, if possible, and to send the old sava e and this Span-
iard over to them to treat. But when we had got all things
in readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started an objec-
tion, which had so much prudence in it, on one hand, and

we should wait another harvest, that we might have a sup-

was very good living, too, I assure you, for it is exceeding-
ly nourishing. '
It was now harvest, and our crop in good order; it was
not the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island,
but, however, it was enough to answer our end; for from
twenty-two bushels of barley we brought in and threshed
out above two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like
in proportion of the rice; which was store enough for our
food to the next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards
had been on shore with me; or if we had been ready for a
voyage, it would very plentifully have victualed our ship

any part of America. When we had thus housed and
secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make
more wickerware, viz., great baskets in which we kept it;
and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this
part, and often blamed me that I did not make some things
or defense of this kind of work; but I saw no need of it.
, And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests
I expected,1 gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the

we never asked. Under these instructions, the Spaniard

shore. They went away with a fair gale, on the day that
the moon was at full, by my account in the month of Octo-
‘her; but as for an exact reckoning of days, after I had
once lost it, I could never recover it again, nor had I kept
even the number of years so punctually as to be sure I was
right; though, as it proved, when I afterward examined
my account, I found had kept a true reckoning of years.
It was no less than eight days I had waited for them,
when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of
which the like has not~ perhaps been heard of in history. I
was fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when my man
Friday came running in to me,‘and called aloud, Master,
master, thev are come, they are come! I jumped up,v
and, regardless of danger, I went out as soon as I could
get my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by the
way, was by this time grown to be a very thick wood; 1
say, regardless of danger, 1 went without my arms, which
it was not my custom to do; but I was sur rised when,
turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a cat about a
league and a half distant, standing in for the shore, with a
shoulder-of-inutton sail, as they call it, and the wind blow-
ing pretty fair to bring them in; also I observed presently
that they did not come from that side which the shore lay
on, but from the southernmost end of the island. Upon
this, I called Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these
were not the people we looked for, and that we might not
know yet whether they were friends or enemies. 1n the
next Iilace, I went in to fetch my perspective glass, to see
what could make of them; and having taken the ladder
out, I climbed up to the top of the hill, as I used to do
when l was apprehensive of anything, and to take my view
the plainer without being discovered. I had scarce set my
foot upon the bill, when my eye plainly discovered a ship
lying at anchor, at about two leagues and a half dis-
tant from me, S.S.E., but not above a league and a half
from the shore. By my observation, it appeared plain] to
be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an n-
glish long- cat.
I can not express the confusion I was in; though the joy
of seeing a ship, and one that I had reason to' believe was
manned by my own countrymen, and, cons uently, friends,
was such as I can not describe; but yet 1 ad some secret

drive them in there, as in distress; and that if they Were
really English, it was most probable that they were here
upon no good design; and that I had better continue as I
was, than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers.
Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of dan-
get which sometimes are given him when he may think
there is no possibility of its being real. That such hints
and notices are given us, I believe few that have made any
observations of things can deny; that they are certain dis,
coveries of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we
can not doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to be to
warn us of danger, why should we not suppose they are
from some friendly agent (whether supreme, or inferior
and subordinate, is not the question), and that they are
given for our good?

y this secret admonition, come it from whence it will, I
had been undone inevitably, and in a far worse condition
than before, as you will see presently. I had not kept my-
self long in this posture, but I saw the boat draw near the
shore, as if they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the
convenience of landing; however, as they did not come
quite far enough, they did not see the little inlet where I
formerly landed my rafts, but run their boat on shore upon
the beach, at about half a mile from me, which was very
happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed just
at my door, a_s I may say, and would soon have beaten me
out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered me of all I had.

out to me in English, as well as he could, Oh, master! you

Why, riday, says I, do you think they are going to eat
them then? Yes, says Friday, they will eat them. No,
no, sa s I, Friday; I am afraid they will murder them, in,-
deed, at you may be sure they will not eat them.
All this while I had no thought of what the matter really
was, but stood trembling wrth the horror of the sight, ex‘
pecting every moment when the three prisoners should be


killed; nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up his arm
with agreat cutlass, as the seamen call it, or sword, to
strike one of the poor men; and I expected to see him fall
eyery moment; at which all the blood in my body seemed
to run chill in my veins. I wished heartily now for my
Spaniard, and the savage that was gone with him, or that
I had any way to have come undiscovered within shot of
them, that I might have rescued the three men, for I saw

usage of the three men by the insolent seamen, I observed
the fellows run scattering about the island, as if they
wanted to see the country. 1 observed that the three other
men had liberty to go also where they pleased; but they sat
down all three upon the ground, very pensive, and looked

and really they were in a condition of safety, at the same
time that they thought themselves 10st, and their case des-

much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the great
Maker of the world, that He does not leave His creatures
so absolutely destitute, but that, in the worst circum-
stances, they have aiways something to be thankful for,
and sometimes are nearer their deliverance than they in-
agine, nay, are even brought to their deliverance by the
means by which they seem to be brought to destruction.

which they all soon came to the boat; ut it was past all
their strength to launch her, the boat being very heavy,
and the shore on that side being a soft, oozy sand, almost
like a quicksaud. In this condition, like true seamen, who
are perhaps the least of all mankind given to forethought,
they gave it over, and away they strolled about the country
again; and I heard one of them say aloud to another, call-

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any

their condition to get any sleep, were, however, sat down

The poor man, with tears running down his face, and
trembling, looking like one astonished, returned, Am I
talking to God 01' man? Is it a real man or an angel? Be
in no fear about that, sir, said I; if God had sent an angel
to relieve you, he would have come better clothed, and

pieces, one of which they left in the boat. Well, then,
said 1, leave the rest to me; I see they are all asleep, it is
an easy thing to kill them all; but shall we rather take
them prisoners? He told me there were two desperate vil-
lains among them that it was scarce safe to show any
mercy to; but if they were secured, he believed all the rest
would return to their duty. I asked him which they were.
He told me he could not at that distance distinguish them,
but he would obey my orders in anything I would direct.
- Well, says I, let us retreat out of their view or hearing,
lest they awake, and we will resolve further. So they
willingly went back with me, till the woods covered us
from them.
Look you, sir, said I, if I venture upon your deliver-
‘ anoe, are you willing to make two conditions with me? He
anticipated my proposals, by telling me, that both he and
the ship, if recovered, should be wholly directed and com-
manded by me in everything; and, ii the ship was not re-
covered, he would live and die with me in what part of the
world soever I would send him; and the two other men
said the same. Well, says I, my conditions are but two;

He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith
of man could devise, that he would comply with these
most reasonable demands; and, besides, would owe his life
to me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions, as long as he
lived. Well, then, said I, here are three muskets for yen,

the shot. He said very modestly that he was loath to kill
them, if he could help it; but that those two were incon-
rigible villains and' had been the authors of all the mutiny
in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone still;
for they would go on board and bring the whole ship’s
company, and destroy us all. Well, then, says I, necessity
legitimates my advice, for it is the only way to save our
lives. However, seeing him still cautious of shedding
blood, I told him they should go themselves and manage
as they found convenient.
In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them
awake, and soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I
asked him if either of them were the heads of the mutiny?
He said no. Well, then, said I, you may let them escape;
and Providence seems to have awakened them on purpose
to save themselves. Now, says I, if the rest escape you,
it is your fault. Animated with this, he took the musket
I had given him in his hand, a pistol in his belt, and his
two comrades with him, with each a piece in his hand; the

iece. They had so well aimed their shot at the men they
new, that one of them was killed on the s t, and the
other very much wounded; but not being dea , he started
up on his feet, and called eagerly for hel to the others;
but the ca tain stepping to him, told him it was too late to
cry for he p, he should call upon God to forgive his vil-
lainy; and with that word knocked him down ‘with the
stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more; there
were three more in the company, and one of them was also
slightly wounded. By this time I was come; and when
they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to resist,
they begged for mercy. The captain told them he would
spare their lives, if they would give him any assurance of
t eir abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of,
and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the
ship, and afterward in carrying her back to Jamaica, from
whence they came. They gave him all the protestations
of their sincerity that could be desired, and he was willing
to believe them, and spare their'lives, which 1 wa not
against, only that 1 obliged him to keep them bound hand
and foot while they were on the island.
While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain’s
mate to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring
away the cars and sails, which they did; and by and by
three straggling men, that were, happily for them, parted

upon himself, and how I seemed to have been preserved

came out, viz., at the top of the house, where I refreshed
them with such provisions as 1 had, and showed them all
the contrivances I had made during my-long, long in-
habiting that place.

tion, and how perfectly I had concealed my retreat with av
grove of trees, which, having been new planted near twenty
years, and the trees growing much faster than in England,
was become a little wood, and so thick, that it was im-
passable in any part of it, but at that one side where I had
reserved my little winding passage into it. I told him this
was my castle and my residence, but that I had a seat in
the country, as most princes have, whither I could retreat
upon occasion, and I would show him that too another
time; but at present our business was to consider how to
recover the ship. He agreed with me as to that; but told
me he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take, for
that there were still six-and-twenty hands on board, who
having entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which they had
all forfeited their lives to the law, would be hardened in l“
now by desperation, and would carry it on, knowing that,
if they were subdued, they would be brought to the gal-
lows, as soon as they came to England, or to any of the
English colonies; and that, therefore, there would be no
attacking them with so small a number as we were.
I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found
it was a very rational conclusion, and that, therefore, some-
thing was to be resolved on speedily, as well to draw the
men on board into some snare fo. their surprise, as to pre-
vent their landing u on us, and destroying us. Upon this
it presently occur-re to me that in a little while the ship’s
crew, wondering what was become of their comrades, and
of the boat, would certainly come on shore in their other
‘ boat, to look for them; and that th.n, perhaps, they might
come armed, and be too strong for us; this he allowed to

to do was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so
that they might not carry her oif; and taking everything

accordingly we went on board, took the arms which were

which was very welcome to me, especially the brandy and
sugar, of which 1 had none left for many years.
When we had carried all these things on shore (the cars,
mast, sail and rudder of the boat were carried away be-
fore, as above), we knocked a great hole in her bottom,
that if they had come strong enough to master us, yet they
could not carr off the boat. Indeed, it was not much in
my thoughts t at we could be able to recover the ship; but
my view was, that if they went away without the boat, I

as they approached, that there were no less than ten men

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we
had a full view of them as they came, and a plain sight
even of their faces; because the tide having set them a lit-
tle to the east of the other heat, they rowed up under shore,
to come to the same place where the other had landed, and
where the boat lay; by this means, I say, we had a full view
of them, and the captain knew the persons and characters
of all the men in the boat, of whom, he said, there were

smiled at him, and told him that men in our circum-
stances were past the operation of fear; that seeing almost
every condition that could be was better than that which
we were supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the
consequence, whether death or life, would be sure to be a
deliverance. I asked him what he thought of the circum-
stances of my life, and whether a deliverance were not
worth venturing for? And where, sir, said 1, is your be-
lief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your life,
which elevated you a little while ago; for my part, said I,
there seems to me but one thing amiss in all the prospect
of it. What is that? says he. Why, says 1, it is, that as
you say there are three or four honest feilew's among them,
which should be spared, had they been all of the wicked
part of the crew, I should have thought God’s providence
ad singled them out to deliver them into your hands; fon,

and were very thankful that they had such good usage as
to have provisions and light left them; for Friday gave them
candles (such as we made ourselves) for their comfort; and
they did not know but that he stood sentinel over them at
the entrance. ,
The other prisoners had better usage: two of them were
kept pinioned, indeed, because the captain was not free to
trust them; but the other two were taken into my service,
upon the captain’s recommendation, and upon their
solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them
and the three honest men we were seven men well armed;
and I made no doubt we should be able to deal well enough
with the ten that were coming, considering that the cap-
tain had said that there were three or four honest men
among them also. As soon as they got to the place where
their other boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and
came on shore, hauling the boat up after them, which 1
was glad to see; for l was afraid they would rather have
left the boat at anchor, some distance from the shore,

set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their
might, to try if they could make their companions hear;
but all was to no purpose: then they came all close in a

We card, and the echoes made the woods ring; but it was
all one: those in the cave we were sure could not hear; and
those in our keeping, though they heard it well enough,
yet durst give no answer to them. They were so aston-
ished at the surprise of this, that, as they told us after-
ward, they resolved to go all on board again to their ship,
and let them know that the men were all murdered, and
the long-boat staved; accordingly, they immediately
launched their boat again, and got all of ther )n board.
The captain was terribly amazed and eve . confounded
at this, believing they would go on board the ship again,
and set sail, giving their comrades over for lost, and so he
should still lose the ship, which he was in bones we should
have recovered; but he was quickly as much frightened the
other way.
They had not been long put off with the boat, but we
perceived them all coming on shore again; but with this
new measure in their conduct, which it seems they con-
sulted together upon, viz., to leave three men in the boat,
and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to
look for their fellows. This was a great disappointment to
us', for now we Were at a loss what to do; as our seizing
these seven men on shore would be no advantage to us, if
we let the boat escape; because they would then row away
to the ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to
weigh and set sail, and so our recovering the ship would be
lost. However, we had no remedy but to wait and see
what the issue of things might present. The seven men
came on shore, and the three who remained in the boat put

to come at them in the boat. Those that came on shore
kept close together, marching toward the top of the little

of the place, that they resolved to go on board the ship
again, give their companions over for 10st, and so go on
with their intended voyage with the ship.
As soon as I perceived them go toward the shore, I imag-
ined it to be, as it really was, that they had given over their
search, and were for gain back again; and the captain, as
soon as I told him my t oughts, was ready to sink at the
apprehensions of it: but I presently thought of a stratagem
to fetch them back again, and which answered my end to
a tittle. I ordered Friday and the ca tain’s mate to go
over the little creek westward, toward t e place where the
savages came on shore when Friday Was rescued, and as
soon as they came to a little rising ground, at about half a
mile distance, 1 bade them halloo out, as loud as they could,
and wait till they found the seamen heard them; that as
soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them, they
should return it again; and then keeping out of si ht, take
a round, always answering when the others hal coed, to
draw them as far into the island, and among the woods. es
possible, and then wheel about again to me, by such ways
as I directed them. '
7 They were just going into the boat when Friday and the
mate hallooed: and they presently heard them, and answer-
ing, ran along the shore westward, toward the voice they
heard, when they were presently stopped by the creek,
where the water being up, they could not get over, and
called for the boat to come up and set them over; as, in-
deed, I eXpeoted. When they had set themselves ever, I
observed that the boat being gone a good way into the
creek, and, as it were, in a harbor within the land, the
took one of the three men out of her, to go along wit
them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened her
to the stump of a little tree on the shore. This was what
I wished for; and immediately leaving Friday and the cap-
tain’s mate to their business, 1 took the rest with me, and
crossing the creek out of‘ their sight, we surprised the two
men before they were aware; one of them lyin on the
shore, and the other being in the boat. The ellow on
shore was between sleeping and waking, and goin to start
up; the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon im, and
knocked him down; and then called out to him in the boat
to yield, or he was a dead man. There needed very few
arguments to persuade a single man to yield, when he saw

sides, this was, it seems, one of the three who were not so
hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore
was easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterward to
join very sincerely with us. In the meantime, Frida and
the captain’s mate so well managed their business wit the
rest, that they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from
one hill to another, and irorn one wood to another, till they
not only heartily tired them, but left them where they were
very sure they could not reach back to the boat before it
was dark; and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves
also, by the time they came back to us.
We had nothing new to do but to watch for them in the
dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with
them. It: was several hours after Friday came back to me
before they came back to their boat; and we could hear the
foremost of them, long before they came quite up, calling
to those behind to come along; and could also hear them
answer, and complain how lame and tired they were, and

not able to come any faster, which was very welcome news
to us. At length they came up to the boat: but it it im-
possible to express their confusion when they found the boat
ast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two
men gone. We could hear them call to one another in a
most lamentable manner, telling one another they were got
into an enchanted island: that either there were inhabitants
in it, and they should all so murdered, or else there were
devils and/spirits in it, and they should be all carried away
and devoured. They hallooed again, and called their two
comrades by their names a great many times; but no an-
swer. After some time, we could see them, by the little
light there was, run about, wringing their hands like men
in despair; and that sometimes they would go and sit down
in the boat, to rest themsclves; then come ashore again, and
walk about again, and do the same thing over again: My
men would fain have had me give them leave to fall upon
them at once in the dark; but I was willing to take them
at some advantage, so to spare them, and kill as few of
them as I could; and especially I was unwilling to hazard
the killing of any of our men, knowing the others were
very well armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not
separate; and, therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my
ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to
creep upon their hands and feet, as close to the ground. as
they could, that they might not be discovered, and get as
near them as-they could possibly, before they offered to
236 nosrnson causes.
They had not been long in that posture, when the boat-
swain, who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and
had now shown himself the most dejected and dispirited of
all the rest, came walking toward them, with two more of
the crew: the captain was so eager at having this principal
.rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have
patience to let him come so near as to be sure of him, for
they only heard his tongue before: but when they came
nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on their feet,

advanced with my whole army, which was now eight men,
vm, myself, generahssimp; Friday, my lieutenant-general;
the captain and his two men, and the three prisoners of
war, whom we had trusted with arms. We came upon
them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see our
number; and 1 made the man they had left in the boat,
who was now one of us, to‘call them by name, to'try if I
could bring them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce
them to terms; which fell out just as we desired: for, in-
deed, it was easy to think, as their condition than was, they
would be willing to capitulate. So he calls out, as loud as
he could, to one of them, Tom Smith! Tom Smith! Tom,
Smith answered immediately, Is that Robinson? For it
seems he knew the voice. The other answered, Ay, ay;

and if you do not yield. you are all lost. Will they give
us quarter then? says Tom Smith, and we will yield. I
will go ask, if you promise to yield, says Robinson: so he
asked the captain; and the captain himself then calls out,

arms immediately, and submit, you shall have your lives,

three were in all but eight, came up and seized u on them,
and upon their boat; only that I kept mysel and one
more out of sight for reasons of state.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seiz-
ing the ship: and as for the captain, now he had leisure to
parley with them, he expostulated with them upon the
villainy of their practices with him, and- at length upon the
further wickedness of their design, and how certainly it
must bring them to misery and distress in the end, and
perhaps to the allows. They all ap cared very penitent,
and begged bar for their lives. As or that, he told them
they were none of his prisoners, but the commander’s of
the island; that they thought they had set him on shore on
a barren, uninhabited island; but it had leased God so to
direct them, that it was inhabited, and t at the governor
was an Englishman; that he might hang them all there,
if be pleased; but as he had given them all quarter, he
supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with
there as 'ustice required, except Atkins, whom he was com-
mauded y the governor to advise to prepare for death, for
that he would be hanged in the morning.

its desired eifect: Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the
captain to intercede with the governor for his life; and all
the rest begged of him, for God’s sake, that they might
not be sent to England.
It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance
was come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring
these fellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the
ship; so I retired in the dark from them, that they might
not see what kind of a governor they had, and called the
captain to me: when 1 called, as at a good distance, one o!

to put it in execution the next morning. But, inorder to
execute it with more heart, and to be secure of success, I

go and take Atkins and two more of the worst of them, and
send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This
was committed to Friday and the two men who came on
shore with the captain. They conveyed them to the cave
as to a prison: and it was, indeed, a dismal place. especi-
ally to men in their condition. The others I ordered to
my bower, as I called it, of which I have given a full de-
scription: and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the ¢
place was secure enough, considering they were upon their
‘ ehavior.
To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to
enter into a parley with them; in a word, to try them, and
tell me whether he thought they might be trusted or no to
go on board and surprise the ship. He talked to them of
the injury done him, of the condition they were brought to,
and that though the governor had given them quarter for
their lives as to the present action, yet that if they were
sent to England they would all be hanged in chains, to
be sure; but that if they would join in so just an attempt
as to recover the ship, he would have the gOVernor’s engage-
ment for their pardon.

accepted by men in their condition; they fell down on their
knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest im pre-
eations, that they would be faithful to him to the lastdrop,
and that they should owe their lives to him, and would go
with him all over the world; that they would own him as
a father as long as they lived. Well, says the captain, I
must go and tell the governor what you say, and see what
I can do to bring him to consent to it. So he brought me
an account of the temper he found them in, and that he
verily believed they would be faithful. However, that we
might be very secure, I told him he should go back again

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with

direction; that if they did, they would be fetched into the
castle, and be laid in irons; so that as we never suffered

faithfully seconded by their men: they secured all the rest

that were upon the main and quarter-decks, and began to
fasten the ' atches, to keep them down that were below;
when the other boat and their men, entering at the fore-
chains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle
which went down into the cook-room, making three men
they found there prisoners. When this was done, and all safe
upon. deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three men,
to break into the round-house, where the new rebel captain

sure I was very glad to hear, having sat watching u on the
shore for it till near two o’clock in the morning. Iaving
thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down, and it having
been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I
was something surprised with the noise of a gun; and pres-
ently starting up, I heard a. man call me by the name of
Governor, Governor, and presently I knew the captain’s
voice; when climbing up to the top of the hill, there he
stood, and pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his
arms. My dear friend and deliverer, says he, there’s
your ship, for she is all yours, and so are we, and all that
belong to her. I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she
rode within a little more than half of a mile of the shore;
for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were
masters of her, and the weather being fair, had brought
her to anchor just against the mouth of the little creek;
and the tide being up, the captain had brought the pinnace

put into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just

for some time, I was not able to answer him one word; but
as he had taken me in his arms, I held fast by him, or I
should have fallen to the ground. He perceived the sur-
prise, and immediately ullcd a bottle out of his pocket, and
gave me a dram of cor ial, which he had brought on pur-
pose for me. After I had drunk it, I hadisat down upon
the ground; and though it brought me to myself, yet it was
a good while before 1 could speak a word to him. All thi
time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as 1, only
not under any surprise, as I was; and he said a thousand
kind and tender things to me, to compose and bring me to
myself: but such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it
put all my spirits into confusion; at last it broke out into
tears; and in a little while after I recovered my speech. 1
then took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and
we rejoiced together. I told him I looked upon him as a
man sent from Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole
transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders; that such
things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand
of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that

fulness to Heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless
Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner provided
for me in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condi-
tion, but from whom every deliverance must always be
acknowledged to proceed?
When we had talked awhile, the captain told me he had

and such as the wretches that had been so long is masters
had not plundered him of. Upon this he called aloud to
the boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore that
were for the governor; and, indeed, it was a present as if
it had been one that was not to be carried away with them,
but as if I had been to dwell upon the island still. First,
he had brought me a case of bottles full of excellent cor-
dial waters, six large bottles of Maderia wine (the bottles
held two quarts each), two pounds of excellent good to-
bacco, twelve good nieces Of..shio’s beef. and six pieces of
pork, with a bag of pease, and about a hundred~weight of
nosmson causes. 243
a bag, full of lemons, and two bottles of lime juice, and
abundance of other things. But, besides these, and what
was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me
six new clean shirts, six very good neck-cloths, two pair of
gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings,
with a very good suit of clothes of his own, which had been
worn but very little; in a word, he clothed me from head to
feet. It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one
may imagine, to one in my circumstances; but never was
anything in the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward,

After these ceremoinies were past, and after all these
good things were brought into my little apartment, we
began to consult what was to be done with the prisoners We
had; for it was worth considering whether we might
venture to take them awa with us or no, especially two of
them, whom we knew to e incorrigible and refractory to
the last degree; and the captain said he knew they
were such rogues, that there was no obliging them; and if _
he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as malefac-

ony he could come at; and 1 found that the captain himself
was very anxious about it. Upon this I told him, that if
he desired it, I would undertake to bring the two'men he
spoke of to make it their own request that he should leave
t em upon the island. I should be very glad of that, says
the captain, with all my heart. Well, says I, I will send
them up, and talk with them for you. So I caused Friday
and the two hostages, for they were now discharged, there

ioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them there till
1 came. After some time, I came thither dressed in my new
habit; and now I was called governor, again. Being all
met, and the captain with me, I caused the men to be
brought before me, and I told them I had got a. full ac-
count oi their villainous behavior to the captain, and how
they had run away with the ship, and were preparing to
commit further robberies, but that Providence had in-
snared them in their own ways, and that they were fallen
into the , it which ,(‘1 * bed dug for others. Ilet them
know that by my direction the ship had been seized; and
that she now lay in the road; and they might see, by and
by, that their new captain had received the reward of his
villainy, and that they would see him hanging at the yard-
arm: that as to them, I wanted to know what they had to
say why I should not execute them as pirates, taken in the
fact, as by my commission they could not doubt but I had
authority to so do. \
One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they
had nothing to say but this, that when they were taken,
the captain promised them their lives, and they humbly im~
plored my mercy. But I told them I knew not what mercy
to show them; for as for myself, I had resolved to quit the
island with all my men, and had taken passage with the
captain to go for England; and as for the captain, he could
not carry them to England other than as prisoners, in irons,
to be tried for mutiny, and running away with the ship;
the consequence of which, they must needs know, would
be the gallows; so that 1 could not tell what was best for
them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in the isl-
and: if they desired that, as I had liberty to leave the island,
1 had some inclination to give 'them their lives, if they
thought they could shift on shore. They seemed very
thankful for it, and said they would much rather venture
to stay there than be carried to England to be hanged: so I
left it on that issue.
However, the captain seemed to make some diiiiculty of
it, as if he durst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed
a little angry with the captain, and told him that they were

might take them again if he could catch them. Upon this
they appeared very thankful, and I accordingly set them at

to go on board the ship; but told the captain I would stay
that night to prepare my things, and desired him to go on
board, in the meantime, and keep all right in the ship,
and send the boat on shore next day for me; ordering
him, at all events, to cause the new captain, who was killed,
go be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men might see
1m.
When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to
me to my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse
with them on their circumstances. I told them I thought
they had made a right choice; that if the captain had car-
ried them away, they would certainly be hanged. 1 showed
them the new captain hanging at the yard-arm at the ship,
and told them they had nothing less to expect. -
When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I
then told them I would let them into the story of my liv-
ing there, and put them into the way of making it easy to
them: accordingly, I gave them the whole history of the
noemson causes. 24-5
tions, the way 1 made my bread, planted my corn, cured
my grapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to make
them easy. I told them the story also of the seventeen
Spaniards that were to be expected, for whom I left a let-
ter, and made them promise to treat them in common with
themselves. Here it may be noted, that the ca tain, who
had ink on board, was greatly surprised that Fuever hit

but little, and wasted none. I gave t em a description of
the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and
fatten them, and to make both butter and cheese: in a
word, 1 gave them every part of my own story, and told
them I should prevail with the captain to leave them two
barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden seeds, which
I told them I would have been very glad of: also I gave
them the bag of pease which the captain had brought me to
eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase them.
Having done all this, I left them the next day, and went
on board the ship. We pre ared immediately to sail, but
did not weigh that night. T e next morning early, two of

ing a meet lamentable complaint of the other three, begged,
to be taken into the ship, for God’s sake, for they shbuld
be murdered, and bggged the captain to take them on
board, though he hanged them immediately. Upon this,
the captain pretended to have no power without me ; but
after some difficulty, and after their solemn promises of
amendment, they were taken on board, and were some
time after soundly whipped and pickled 2 after which they
proved very honest and quiet fellows.
Some time after this the boat was ordered on shore, the
tide being up, with the things promised to the men ; to
which the captain, at my intercession, caused their chests
and clothes to be added, which they took, and were very
thankful for. I also encouraged them by telling them
that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them
in, I would not forget them.
When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for
relics, the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella,
and one of my parrots; also I forgot not to take the money
I formerly mentioned, which had laid by me so long useless
that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly pass
for silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled ; as
also the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship.
And thus I, left the island, the 19th of December, as I
found by the ship’s account, in the year 1686, after I had
been upon it eight-and-twenty years, two months, and
nineteen days ; being delivered from this second captivity

When I came to England I was as perfect a strager to
all the world as if 1 had never been known there. My
benefactor and faithful steward, whom I had left my
money in trust with, was alive, but had had great misfort-
unes in the world ; was become a widow the second time,
and very low in the world. I made her very easy as to
what she owed me, assuring her I would give her no
trouble ; but, on the contrary, in gratitude for her former
care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little stock
would afford ; which at that time would, indeed, allow me
to do but little for her; but I assured her I would never
forget her former kindness to me ; nor did I forget her

its proper place. I went down afterward into Yorkshire;

but my father was dead, and my mother and all the family
extinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of the
children'of one of my brothers ; and as I had been long
ago given over for dead, there had been no provision made
for me ; so that, in a word, I found nothing to relieve or
assist me ; and that the little money I had would not do
much for me as to settling in the world.
I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did
not expect ; and this was, that the master of the ship
whom I had so happily delivered,and by the same means
saved the ship and cargo, having given a very handsome
account to the owners of the manner how I had saved the
lives of the men and the ship, they invited me to meet
them and some other merchants concerned, and all together
made me a.very handsome compliment upon the subject,
and a present of almost two hundred pounds sterling.

settling me in the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and
see if I might not come at some information of the state

my partner, who I had reason to suppose, had some years
past given me over for dead. With this view I took ship-
ping for Lisbon, where I arrived in April following, my
man Friday accompanying me very honestly in all these
ramblings, and proving ' a most faithful servant upon all
occasions. When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by in-
quiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my old friend the

shore of Africa. He was now grown old, and had left off
going to sea, having put his son, who was far from a young
man, into his ship, and who still used the Brazil trade.
The old man did not know me ; and indeed, I hardly knew
him ; but I soon brought him to my remembrance, and as
soon brought myself to his remembrance when I told him
who I was.
After some passionate expressions of the old acquaint-
ance between us, I inquired, you may be sure, after my
plantation and my partner. The old man told me he had
not been in the Brazils for about nine years ; but that he
could assure me that when he came away my partner was
living ; but the trustees whom I had joined with him to
take cognizance of my part were both dead: that, however,
he believed I would have a very good account of the im-l
provement of the plantation ; for that, upon the general
belief of my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had
given the account of the produce of my part of the plan-

sion of the Indians to the Catholic faith : but that, if I ap-
peared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it
would be restored ; onl that the improvement, or annual
production, being distributed to charitable uses, could not
'be restored ; but he assured me that the steward of the
king’s revenue from lands, and the providore, or steward
of the monastery, had taken great care all along'that the in-
cumbent, that is to say, my partner, gave every year a faith-
ful account of the produce, of which they had duly received
my moiety. I asked him if 'he knew to what height of im-
provement he had brought_the plantation, and whether
he thought it might be worth looking after; or whether,
on my going thither, I should meet with any obstruction
to my possessing my just right in_ the moiety. He told me
he could not tell exactly to what degree the plantation was
improved ; but this he knew, that my partner was grown
exceeding rich upon the enjoying his part of it ; and that,
to the best of his remembrance, he had heard that the
king's third of my part, which was, it seems, granted away
to some other monastery or religious house, amounted to
above two hundred moidores a year ; that as to my being
restored to a quiet possession of, there was no question
to be made of that, my partner being alive to witness my
title, and my name being also enrolled in the register of
the country ; also he told me that the survivors of my two
trustees were very fair, honest peOple, and very wealthy ;
and he believed I would not only have their assistance for

able sum of money in their hands for my account, being
the produce of the farm while their fathers held the trust,
and before it was given up, as above; which, as he remem-
bered, was for about twelve years.
I showed myself alittle concerned and uneasy at this ac—
count. and inquired of the old captain how it came to pass
that the trustees should thus dispose of my effects, when
he knew that I had made my will, and had made him, the
Portuguese captain, my universal heir, etc.
/ He told me that was true; but that as there was no proof
of mybeing dead, he could not act as my executor until some
certain accbunt should come of my death; and, besides, he
was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote : that
it was true he had registered my will and put in his claim ;
and could he have given any account of my being dead or
aliVe, he would have acted by procuration, and taken pos-
session of the ingenio (so they call the sugar-house), and
have given his son, who was now at the Brazils, orders to
do it. “Bnt,” says the old man, “ I have one piece of
news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable
to you as the rest; and that is, believing you were lost, and
all the world believing so also, your partner and trustees

at that time great disbursements for increasing the works,
building an lngenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount
to near so much as afterward it produced ; however," says
the old man, “ I shall give you a true account of what I.
,have received in all, and how I have disposed of it.”

merchant-trustees, being always delivered in goods—viz.,

ably increased; but, as above, the disbursements being

he having been shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about
eleven years after my leaving the place. The good man
then began to complain of his misfortunes. and how he
had been obliged to make use of my money to recover his
losses, and buy him a share in a new ship. “ However,
my old friend,” says he, “ you shall not want a supply in
your necessity ; and as soon as my son returns you shall be

gold ; and giving the writings of his title to the ship which _
his son was gone to the Brazils in, of which he was quarter
part owner, and his son another, he puts them both into
my hands for security of the rest.
I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of
the poor man to be able to b tar this ; and remembering
what he had done for me, how he had taken me up at sea,
and how generously he had used me on all occasions, and
particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could
hardly refrain weeping at what he had said to me ; there-
fore I asked him if his circumstances admitted him to spare
so much money at that time, and if it would not straiten
him? He told me he could not say but it might straiten
him a little ; but, however, it was my money, and I might
want it more than he.
Everything the good man said was full of affection, and
I could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke ; in short,
I took one hundred of. the moidores, and called for a pen
and ink to give him a receipt for them ; then I returned
him the rest, and told him if ever I had possession of the
plantation I would return the other to him also (as, in-
deed, I afterward did) ; and that as to the bill of sale of
his part in his son’s ship, I would not take it by any means;
but that if I wanted the money, I found he was honest
enough to pay me ; and if I did not, but came to receive
what he gave me reason to expect, I would never have a
penny more from him.
When this was past, the 0m man asked me if he should
put me into a method to make my claim to my plantation.
I told him I thought to go over to it myself. IH€ said I
might do so if I pleased, but that if I did not, there were
ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to ap‘

me to send it, with a letter of his writing, to a merchant
of his acquaintance at the place, and then proposed my
staying with him till an account came of the return.
Never was anything more honorable than the proceedings
upon this procuration; for in less than seven months I re-
ceived a large packet from the survivors of my trustees;
the merchants for whose account I went to sea, in which
were the following particular letters and papers inclosed:
First, there was the account current of the produce of my
farm or plantation, from the year when their fathers had bal-
anced with my old Portugal captain, being for six years; the
balance appeared to be one thousand one hundred and
seventy-four moidores in my favor.
SecOndIy, there was the account of four years more,
while they kept the effects in their hands, before the gov-

a person ‘not to be found, which they called civil death;
and the balance of this, the value of the plantation increasing,
amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-six
crusadoes, being about three thousand two hundred and forty
moidores.
Thirdly, there was the Prior of St. Augustine's account,

not being able to account for what was disposed of by the
hospital, very honestly declared he had eight hundred and
seventy-two moidores not distributed, which he acknowl-
edged to my account. As to the king's part, that refunded
nothing. ‘
There was a letter of my partner's: congratulating me
very affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an ac-
count how the estate was improved and what it produced
a year; with the particulars of the number of squares or
acres that it contained, how planted, how many slaves
there were upon it: and making two and twenty crosses
for blessings; told me he had said so many Ave Marias to
thank the Blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me very
passionately to come over and take possession of my own
and in the meantime to give him orders to whom he should
deliver my effects if I did not come myself; concluding
with a hearty tender of his friendship and that' of his

I had now to consider which way to steer my course next,
and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus
put into my hands ; and, indeed, I had more care upon my
head now than I had in my state of life in the island,
where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing
but what I wanted; whereas I had now a great charge upon
me, and my business was how to secure it; I had not a
cave now to hide my money in, or a place where it might
lie without lock or key till it grew moldy and tarnished
before anybody would meddle with it ; on the cOntrary, I-
knew not where to put it or whom to trust with it. My
, old patron the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was
the only refuge I had. In the next place, my interest in
the Brazils seemed to summon me thither; but now I
could not tell how to think of going thither till I had
settled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands

who I knew was honest, and would be just to me'; but
then she was in years, and but poor, and, for aught I
knew, might be in debt ; so that, in a word, I had no way
but to go back to England myself and take my effects with
me. It was some months, however, before I resolved upon
this; and, therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain
fully, and to his satisfaction, who had been my former
benefactor, so I began to think of the poor widow, whose

pounds from me, and to talk with her and comfort her in-
, her poverty, by telling her she should, if I lived, have a
further supply; at the same time I sent" my two sisters in
the country a hundred pounds each, they being, though
' not in want, yet not in very good circumstances, one hav-
ing been married and left a widow, and the other having
a husband not so kind to her as he should be; But among
all my relations or acquaintances I could not yet pitch
upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock,
that I might go away to the Brazils and leave things safe
behind me ; and this greatly perplexed me.
I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils and have
settled myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalized to
the place ; but I had some little scruple in my mind about
religion, which insensibly drew me back. However, it was
not religion that kept me from going there for the present;
and as I had made no scruple of being openly of the re-
ligion of the country all the while I was among them, so
neither did I yet ; only that, now and then, having of late
thought more of it than formerly, when I began to think
of living and dying among them, I began to regret having
professed myself a Papist, and thought it might not be the
best religion to die with. ' ‘
But, as I_ have said, this was not the main thing that
kept me from going to the Brazils, but that really I did
not know with whom to leave my effects behind me; so I
resolved at last to go to England, where, if I arrived, I

upon me so much that though I had once shipped my
baggage in order to go, yet I altered my mind, and that
not once, but two or three times.
It is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this
might be one of the reasons ;‘but let no man slight the
strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such mo-
ment: two of the ships which I had singled out to go in—I
mean more particularly singled out than any other, having
put my things on board one of them, and in the other hav-
ing agreed with the captain—I say two of these ships mis-
carried: one was taken by the Algerines, and the other
was lost on the Start, near Torbay, and all the people
drowned except three ; so that in either of those vessels I
had been made miserable. .
Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot,
to whom I communicated everything, pressed me earnestly
not to go by sea, but either to go by land to the Groyne,
and cross over the Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence
it was but an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and
so to Calais and Dover ; or to go up to Madrid, and so all
the way by land through France. In a word, I was so pre-
possessed against my going by sea at all, except from Calais
to Dover, that I resolved to travel all the way by land;
which, as I was not in haste, and did not value the charge,
Was by much the pleasanter way ; and to make it more so,
my old captain brought an English gentleman, the son of
a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me;
after which we picked up two more'English merchants
also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going

servants ; the two merchants and the two Portuguese con-
tenting themselves with one servant between two, to save
the charge; and as for me, I got an English sailor to travel
with me as a servant, besides my man Friday, who was too
much a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of a
servant on the road.
In this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our company
being very well mounted and armed, we made a little
troop, whereof they did me the honor to call me captain,
as well because I was the oldest man, as because I had two
servants, and, indeed, was the origin of the whole journey.
As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so
I shall trouble you now with none of my land journals; but
some adventures that happened to us in this tedious and
difficult journey I must not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we being all of \us strangers
to Spain, were willing to stay some time to see the Court of
Spain and what was worth observing; but it being the .
latter part of the summer, we hastened away, and set out
from Madrid about the middle of October; but when we
came to the edge of the-Navarre we were alarmed, at several
towns on the way, with an account that so much snow was
falling on the French. side of the mountains that several
travelers were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after
having attempted at an extreme hazard to tpass on.
When we came to Pampeluna itself, we ound it so in-
deed; and to me, that had been always used to a hot
climate, and to countries where I could scarce bear any
clothes on, the cold was insufferablejndr, indeed, was it
more painful than surprising to come but ten days before
out of Old Castile, where the weather was not only warm
but very hot, and immediately to feel a, wind from the
Pyrenean Mountains so very keen, so severely cold, as to
be intolerable, and to endanger benumbing and perishing
256 ROBINSON causon.
Poor Friday was really frightened when. he saw the
mountains all covered with snow and ,felt cold weather,
which he had never seen or felt before in his life. To
mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna it continued
snowing with so much violence and so long, that the people
said winter was come before its time; and the roads, which

word, the snow lay in some places too thick for us to
travel, and being not hard frozen, as is the case in the
northern countries, there was no going without bein in
danger of being, buried alive every step. We stave no
less than twenty days at Pampeluna; when (seeing the
winter coming on, and no likelihood of its being better, for
it was the severest winter all over Europe that had been
known in the memory of man) I proposed that we should
go away to Fontarabia. and there take shipping for Bor-
deaux, which was a very little voyage. But while I was
considering this, there came in four French gentlemen,
who, having been stopped on the French side of the passes,
as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who,
traversing the country near the head of Languedoc, had
brought them over the mountains by such ways that they '
were not much incommoded with the snow; for where they
met with snow in any quantity, they said it was frozen hard
enough to hear them and their horses. We sent for' this
guide, who told us he would undertake to carry us the
same way, with no hazard from the snow, rovi ed we were

wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains,
being made ravenous for want of food, the, ground being
covered with snow. We told him we were Well enough

told, we were in most danger from, especially, on~ the

was no danger of that kind in the way that we were to go;
so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other
gentlemen with their servants, some French, some Spanish,
who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to
come back again.
Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna with our guide
on the 15th of November ; and, indeed, I was surprised,
when, instead of going forward, he came directly back with
us on the same road that we came from Madrid, about
twenty miles ; when, having passed two rivers, and come
into the plain country, ,we found ourselves in a warm
climate. again, where the country was pleasant, and no
snow to be seen ; but, on a sudden, turning to his left, he
approached the mountains another way ; and though it is
true the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he made
so many tours, such meanders, and led us by such winding
ways, that we insensibly passed the height of the mount-
ains without being much encumbered with the snow ; and


all on a sudden he showed us the pleasant and fruitful

ishing, though at a great distance, and we had some rough
way to'pass still.‘ I
We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it
snowed one whole day and night so fast that we could not
travel ; but be bid us be easy ; we would soon be past it
all ; we found, indeed, that we began to descend every day
and to come more north than before ; and so, depending
upon our guide we went on.
It was about two hours before night when, our guide
being something before us, and not just in sight, out
rushed three monstrous wolves, and after them a bear,
from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood ; two of the
wolves made at the guide, and had he been far before us,
he would have been devoured before we could have helped
him ; one of them fastened upon his horse, and the other
attacked the man with such violence that he had not time
or presence of mind enough to draw his pistol, but hallooed
and cried out to us most lustily. My man ‘Friday being
next me, I bade him ride up and see what was the matter

but like a bold fellow, rode directly up to the poor man,
and with his pistol shot the wolf in the head that attacked
him.
It was happy for the poor man that it was my man

country, he had no fear upon him, but went close up to

and, indeed, it alarmed all our company, when, with the
noise of Friday’s pistol we heard on both sides the most
dismal howling of wolves ; and the noise, redoubled by the
echo of the mountains, appeared to us as if there had been
a prodigious number of them; and perhaps there was not
such a few as that we had no cause of apprehension ; how-
ever, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other that had

creature had bit him twice, once in the arm, and the other
time a little above his knee; and though he had made some
defense, he was just tumbling down by the disorder of his
horse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf,

which blinded us before, we saw clearly what had been the
case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though
we did not presentlv discern what kind of a creature it was

another way and keep going on; for sometimes if you stop,

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we
came up to him he was helping him~off his horse, for the

The hear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle
with nobody, till Friday, coming pretty near, calls to him,
as if the bear could understand him : “ Hark ye, hark ye,”
says Friday ; “ me speakee with you.” We followed at a
distance, for now being down on the Gascony side of the
mountains, we were entered a vast forest, where the coun-
try was plain and pretty open, though it had many trees in
it scattered here and there. Friday, who had, as we say,
the heels of the bear, came up with him quickly, and took
up a great stone, and threw it at him, and hit him just on
the head, but did him no more harm than if he had thrown
it against a wall ; but it answered Friday’s end, for the
rogue was so void of fear that he did it purely to make the
bear follow him and show us some laugh, as he called it.
As soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw him, he turns
about and comes after him, taking very long strides, and
shuffling on at a strange rate, so as would have put a horse
to a middling gallop; away runs Friday, and takes his
course as if he ran toward us for help ; so we all resolved

he was going about his own business another way ; and

especially I was angry that he had turned the bear upon
us, and then ran away; and I called out, “You dog! is
this your making us laugh ? Come away, and take your ‘
horse, that we may shcot the creature." He heard me,
and cried out, “ No shoot, no shoot; stand still, and you
get much laugh:" and as the nimble creature ran two feet
for the bear's one, he turned on a sudden on one side of

up the tree, laying his gun down upon the ground, at

but let it he and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing
like a cat, though so monstrous heavy. I was amazed at
the folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could not for
my life see anything to laugh at, till seeing the bear ge't
up the tree, We all rode near to him. ‘
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out
to the small end of a large branch, and the bear got
about half-way to him. , As soon as the bear got out to
that part where the limb of the tree was weaker—~“ Ha l”
says he to us, “ now you see me teachee the bear dance ;"
so he began jumping and shaking the bough, at which
the bear began to totter, but stood still, and began to
look behind him to see how he should get back; then,
indeed, we did laugh heartily; , But Friday had not
done with him by a great deal ; when, seeing him stand
still, he called out to him again, as if be supposed the
bear could speak English, " What, you come no further .7
pray you come further ;” so he left jumping and shaking
the tree ; and the bear, just as if he understood what he
said, did come a little further; then he began jumping
again, and the bear. stopped again. .We thought now
was a good time to knock him in' the head, and called to
Friday to stand still and we should shoot the bear; but
he cried out earnestly, “ Oh,- pray! oh, pray! no shoot;
me shoot by and then ;” he would have said by and by.
However, to shorten the story, Friday danced so much, ~
and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had laugh-
ing enough, but still could not imagine what the

upon shaking the bear off; and we found the bear was
too cunning for that too ; for he would not go out
far enough to be thrown down, but clung fast with his
great broad claws and feet, so that we could not imagine
what would be the end of it, and what the jest would be
‘ at last. But Friday put us out of doubt quickly : for see-
ing the bear cling fast to the bough,and that he would not
be persuaded to come any further, “Well, well,” says
Friday, “you no come further, me go; you no come to
me, me come to you ;” and upon this he went out to the
smaller end of the bough, where it would bend with his
weight, and gently let himself down by it, sliding down the
bough till he came near enough to jump down on his feet,
and away he ran to his gun, took it up, and stood still.
“Well,” said I to him, “Friday, what will you do now?
Why don't you shoot him?” “No shoot,” says Friday,
“ not yet; me shoot now, me no kill; me stay, give you one
more‘laugh :” and, indeed, so he did; for when the bear
saw his enemy gone, he came back from the bough where
he stood, but did it very cautiously, looking behind him
every step, and coming backward till he got into the body
of the tree; then, with the same hinder end foremost, he
came down the tree, grAsping it with his claws, and mov-
ing one foot at a time, very leisurely. At this juncture,
and just before he could set his hind foot on the ground,
Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle of
his piece in his ear and shot him dead. Then the rogue
turned about to see if we did not laugh ; and when he saw
we were pleased by our looks, he began to laugh very loud.
“ So we kill bear in my country," says Friday. “ So you
kill them?” says I; “why, you have no guns.” “No,”
says he, “no gun, but shoot great much long arrow.”
This was a good diversion to us; but we were still in a wild
place, and our guide very much hurt, and what to do we
hardly knew ; the bowling of wolves ran much in my head ;
and, indeed, except the noise I once heard on the shore of
Africa, of which I have said something already, I never

These things, and the approach of night, called us on,
or else, as Friday would have had us, we should certainly
have taken the skin of this monstrous creature off, which
was worth saving ; but we had near three leagues to go, i
and our guide hastened us; so we left him, and went ‘
forward on our journev. ‘ I
The ground was still covered with snow, though not
so deep and dangerous as on the mountains; and the
ravenous creatures, as we heard afterward, were come
down into the forest and plain country, pressed by hun-
ger, to seek for food, and had done a great deal of mis-
chief in the villages, where they surprised the country
people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses,
and some people, too. 7 We had one dangerous place to 7

bid us keep in a ready posture, for he believed there
were more wolves a-coming. We kept our arms ready,
and our eyes about us; but we saw no more wolves till

of. We had not gone half over the plain when we be-

and away they went to the woods. This gave us leisure
to charge our pieces again; and that we might lose no
time, we kept going; but we had but little more than
loaded our fusees, and put ourselves in readiness, when
we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on our left,
only that it was further onward, the same way we were
to go. ‘
r- The night was coming on, and the light began to be
dusky, which made it worse on our side; but the noise
increasing, we could easily perceive that. it was the howl-
ing and yelling of those hellish creatures; and, on a sud-
den, we perceived three troops of wolves, one on our
left, one behind 'us,‘and one in our front, so that we
seemed to be surrounded with them: however, as they
did not fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as
we could make Our horses go, which, the Way being very
rough, was only a good, hard trot. In this manner, we
came in view of the entrance Of a Wood, through which
we were to pass, at the further side of the plain ; but we
were greatly surprised, when coming nearer the lane orv
pass, we saw a confused number of wolves standing just )
at the entrance. On a sudden, at another opening of,
the wood, we heard the noise of a gun, and looking that;
way, out rushed a horse, with a saddle and bridle on

wolves after him, full speed: the horse had the advan-

hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they would get
up with him at last : no question but they di . '
But here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up
to the entrance where the horse came out, we found the
, carcases of another horse and of two men, devoured by
the ravenous creatures; and one of the men was no

take ; but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gath-
ered about us presently, in hopes of prey; and I ,verily
believe there were three hundred of them. It happened,
very much to our advantage, that at the entrance into
the wood, but a little way from it, there lay some large
timber-trees, which had been cut down the summer be-
fore, and I suppose lay there for carriage. I drew my
little troop in among those trees, and placing ourselves
in a line behind one long tree, I advised them all to
alight, and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork,
to stand in a triangle, or three fronts, inclosipg our
_ horses in the center. We did so, and it was well we did; g
‘for never was a more furious charge than the creatures
made upon us in this place. They came on with a
growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber,
which, as I said, was our breastwork, as if they were only
rushing upon their prey; and this fury of theirs, it seems,
was principally occasioned by their seeing our horses be-

they came on again. I was loath to spend our shot too
hastily; so I called my servant, not my man Friday, for
he was better employed, for, with the greatest dexterity
imaginable, he had charged my fusee and his own while'
we were engaged—but, as I said, I called my other man,
and giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a train

wolves came up to it, and some got upon it; when I,

again, for we had still near a league to go. We heard
the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we
went several times, and sometimes we fancied we saw
some of them ; but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were
not certain. In about an hour more we came to the
town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terri-
ble fright and all in arms ;' for, it seems, the night before
the wolves and some bears had broken into the village,
and put them in'such terror, that they were obliged to
keep guard night and day, but especially in the night, to
preserve their cattle, and indeed their people. A
The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs ‘
swelled so much with the rankling of his two wounds,
that he could go no further ; so we were obliged to take
a new guide, and go to Toulouse, where we found a
warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant country, and no snow,
no wolves, nor anything like them; but when we told our
story at Toulouse, they told us it was nothing but what
was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the mount-
ains, especially when the snow lay on the ground; but
they inquired much what kind of guide we had got who
would venture to bring us that way in such a severe
season, and told us it was surprising we' were not all
devoured. When we told them how we placed ourselves
and the horses in the middle,~they blamed us exceedingly,

stroyed, for it was the sight of the horses which made
the wolves so furious, seeing their prey, and that at
other times they are really afraid of a gun—but being
excessively hungry, and raging on that account, the
eagerness to come at the horses had made them sense-
less of danger—and that if we had not by the continual

Would not have taken the horses so much for their own,

many in number. For my part, I was never so sensible
of danger in my life—for, seeing above three hundred
devils come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us,
and having nothing to shelter us or retreat to, I gave
myself over for lost; and, ash was, I believe I shall
never care to cross those mountains again; I think I
would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea,
though I was sure to meet with a storm once a week.
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my
passage through France—nothing but what other travel-
ers have given an account of with much more advantage
than I can. I traveled from Toulouse to Paris, and
4
without any considerable stay came to Calais, and landed
safe at Dover the 14th of January, after having had a
severe cold season to travel in.
I was. now come to the center of my travels, and had
in a little time all my new-discovered estate safe about
me, the bills of exchange which I brought with me hav-
ing been currently paid. I 1
My principal guide and privy-counselor was my good
ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the money I had
sent her, thought no pains too much nor care too great
to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely that I
was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects ; and, '
indeed, I was very happy from the beginning, and now
to the end, in the unspotted integrity of this good
gentlewoman. ' .
And now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation
in the Brazils, I wrote to my old friend at isbon, who
having offered it to the two merchants, the survivors of
my trustees, who lived in the Brazils, they accepted the
offer, and remitted thirty-three thousand pieces of eight
to a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon to pay for it.
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form
which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man,
who sent me the bills of exchange for thirty-two thous-
and eight hundred pieces of eight for the estate, reserv-
ing the payment of one hundred moidores a year to him

and adventure—a life of Providence’s Checker-work, and
of a variety which the world will seldom be able toshow
the like of ; beginning foolishly, but closing much more
happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so much
to hope for. ‘
Any one would think that in this state of complicated
good fortune I was past running any more hazards—and
so, indeed, I had been, if other circumstances had con?
curred; but I was inured to a wandering life, had no
family, nor many relations; nor, however rich, had
contracted fresh acquaintance; and though I had. sold
my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not keep that coun-

inclination I had to see my island, and to know if the
poor Spaniards were in being there. My true friend,
the widow/earnestly dissuaded me from it, and so far
prevailed with me, that for almost seven years she pre-
vented my running abroad, during which time I took .
my two nephews, the children of one of my brothers,
into my care ; the eldest, having something of his own,

on the island.
Here I stayed about twenty days—left them supplies
of all necessary things, and particularly of arms,
powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two workmen, which I

Besides this, I shared the lands into parts with themI
reserved to myself the property of the whole, but gave
them such parts respectively as they agreed on; and
having settled all things with them, and engaged them
not to leave the place, I left there.
From thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I
sent a bark, which I bought there, with more people to
the island ; and in itfbesides other supplies, I sent seven
women, being such as I found proper for service, or for
wives to such as would take them. As to the English-
men, I promised to send them some women from Eng-
land, with a good cargo of necessaries, if they would ap-
ply themselves to planting—which I afterward could not
perform. The fellows proved very honest and diligent’

ever, it might be allowed me to have had experience of

in my thoughts, should be worn out, and I might, at
sixty-one years of age, have been a little inclined to stay
at home, and have done venturing life and fortune any
more. .
Nay, further, the common motive of foreign adven-
tures was taken away in me, for I had no fortune to
make ; I had nothing to seek ; if I had gained ten thou-
sand pounds I had been no richer; for I had already

what I had was visibly increasing; for, having no great
family, I could not spend the income of what I had, un-
less I would set up for an expensive way of living, such as
a great family, servants, equipage, gayety, and the like,
which were things I had no notion of, or inclination to ; so
that I had nothing, indeed,to do but to sit still, and fully
enjoy what I had got, and see it increase daily upon my
hands. Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at
least not enough to resist the ‘strong inclination I had to
go abroad again, which hung about me like a chronic dis-
temper. In particular, the desire of seeing my new
plantation in the island, and the colony 'I left there, ran
in my head continually. I dreamed of it all night, and
my imagination ran 'upon it all day; it was uppermost
in all my thoughts; and my fancy worked so steadily
and strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep ; in
short, nothing could remove it out of my mind ; it even
broke so violently into all my discourses that it made my
conversation tiresome, for I could talk of nothing else ; all
my discourse ran into it, even to impertinence; and I saw
it myself. .

I have often heard persons of good judgment say, that
all the stir that people make in the world about ghosts
and apparations is owing to the strength of imagination,
and the. pQWerful operation of fancy in their minds;
that there is no such thing as a spirit appearing,v or
a ghost Walking; that people’s poring affectionately
upon the past conversation of their deceased friends
so realizes it to them, that they are capable of fancy-
ing, upon some extraordinary circumstances, that they
see them, talk to them, and are answered by them,
when, in truth, there is nothing but shadow and vapor
in the thing, and they really know nothing of the
matter. 7 _
For my part, I know not to this hour whether there are
any such things as real apparitions, specters, or walking
of people after they are dead ; or whether there is any-
thing in the stories they tell us of that kind more than
the product of vapors, sick minds, and wandering fancies;
but this I know, that my imagination worked up to such
a height, had brought me into such excess of vapors, or
what else I may call it, that I actually supposed myself
often upOn the spot, at my old castle, behind the trees ;
saw my old Spaniard, Friday‘s father, and the reprobate
sailors I left upon the island; nay, I fancied Italked with
them, and looked at them steadily, though 1 was broad
awake, as at persons just before me ; and this I did till
I often frightened myself with the images my fancy
represented to me. One time, in my sleep, I had the

provisions they had laid up,.0n purpose to distress and
starVe them; -things that I had never heard of, and
that, indeed, were never all of them true in fact ; but it
was so warm in my imagination, and so realized to me,
that, to the hour I saw them, I could not be persuaded
but that it was orwould be true ; also how I resented it,
when the Spaniard complained to me; and how I brought
them to justice, tried them, and ordered them all three
to be hanged. What there was really in this shall be
seen in its place; for howeVer I came to form such things
in my dream, and what secret converse of spirits inject-
ed it, yet there was, I say, much of it true. I own that

true ; but the general part was so true—the base, villain-
ous behavior of these three hardened rogues was such,
and had been so much worse than all I can describe,
that the dream had too much similitude of the fact;
and as I would afterward have punished them severely,
‘so if I hanged them all, I had been much in the right,

But to return to my story: In this kind of temper I
lived some years; I had no enjoyment of my life, no,
pleasant hours, no agreeable diversion, but what had
something or other of this in it; so that my wife who
saw my mind wholly bent upon it, told me very seriously
one night, that she believed there" was some secret, POW?
erful impulse of Providence upon me, which had deter-
mined me to go thither again ; and that she found noth-
ing hindered me going but my being engaged to a wife
and children. * She told me that it was true she could
not think of parting with me: But as (she was assured

found me very intent upon her words, and that I looked
very earnestly at her, so that it a little disordered her,
and she stopped. I asked her why she did not go on,
and say out what she was going to say. But I perceived
that her heart was too full, and that some tears .stood in
her eyes.] “Speak out, my dear,” said I: “are you
willing I should go ?” “ No,” says she, very' affection-
ately, “ I am far from willing ; but if you are resolved to
go," says she, “rather than I would be the only hinder-
ance, I will go with you; for though I think it a most
preposterous thing for one of your years, and in your
condition, yet, if it must be,” said she, again weeping, “I
would not leave you ; for if it be of Heaven you 'must do
it, there is no resisting it ; and if Heaven make it your
duty to go, He will also make it mine to go with you,
or otherwise dispose of me, that I may not obstruct
it." .
This affectionate behavior of my wife’s brought me a
r

little out of the vapors, and I began to consider what I
was doing; I corrected my wandering fancy, and began
to argue with myself sedately, what business I had after
threoscore years, and after such a life of tedious suf- '
ferings and disasters, and closed in so happy and easy
a manner; I say, what business had I to rush into new
274 ROBINSGN CRUSOE.
youth and poverty to run into ?
With those thoughts I considered my new engage-
ment; that I had a wife, one child born, and my wife
then great with child of another that I had all the world
could give me, and had no need to seek hazard for
gain ; that I was declining in years, and ought to think
rather of leaving what I had gained than of seeking
to increase it; that ,as to what my wife had said of its
being an impulse from Heaven, and that it should be
my duty to go, I had no notion of that ; so, after many
of these cogitations, I struggled with the power of my
imagination, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe peo-
ple may always db in like cases if they will. In a
word, I conquered it ; composed myself with such argu-
ments as occurred to my thoughts, and which my pres-
ent condition furnished me plentifully with; and par-
ticularly, as the most effectual method, I resolved to
divert myself with other things, and to engage in some
business that might effectually tie me up from any more
excursions of this kind; for I found that thing return

do, not anything of moment immediately before me.
To this purpose, I bought a little farm in the county of
Bedford, and resolved to remove myself thither. I had
a little convenient house upon it, and the land about it,
I found, was capable of great improvement, and was in
many ways suited to my inclination, which delighted in
cultivating, managing, planting, and improving of land ;
and particularly, being an inland country, I was removed
from conversing among sailors and things relating to
the remote parts of the world. I went down to my
farm, settled my family, bought plows, barrows, a
cart, wagon-horses, cows, and sheep, and', setting seri-
ously to work, became in one half year a mere country
gentleman. My thoughts were entirely taken up.in
managing mv servants, cultivating the ground, inclos-
ing, planting, etc; and I lived, as I thought, the most
agreeable life that nature was capable of directing, or
that a man always bred to misfortunes was capable of re-
treating to.
I farmed upon my own land; I had no rent to pay,
was limited by no articles; I could pull Up or cut
down as I pleased; what I planted was for myself,
and what I improved was for my family; and having
thus left off the thoughts of wandering, I had not
the least discomfort in any part of life as to this
world, Now I thought, indeed, that I enjoyed the
middle state of life which my father so earnestly recom-
mended to me, and lived a kind of heavenly life, some-
thing like what is described by the poet, upon the sub-
ject of a country life :
“ Free from vices, free from care,
Age has no pain, and youth no snare."
' But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from un-
seen Providence unhinged me at once; and not only made
a breach upon me inevitable and incurable, but drove me
by its consequences, into a deep relapse of the wander-
ing disposition, which, as I may say, being born in_my
very blood, soon recovered its hold of me; and, like the
returns of a violent distemper, came on with an irresist-
ible force uppn me. This blow was the loss of my wife.
It is not my business here to write an elegy upon my
wife, give a character of her particular virtues, and make
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 275
She was in few words, the stay of all my affairs; the cen-
ter of all my enterprises; the engine that, by her pru-

head, and did more to guide my rambling genius than a
mother’s tears, a father’s instructions, a friend’s counsel,
or all my own reasoning powers could do. I was happy
in listening to her, and in being moved by her entreaties;
and to the last degree desolate and dislocated in the
world by the loss of her.
When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly
round me. I was as much a stranger in it, in

them; for the men of pleasure every day surfeited of
their vice, and heaped up work for sorrow and repent-
ance : and the men of labor spent their strength in daily
struggling for bread to maintain the vital strength they
labored with: so livin in a daily circulation of sorrow,
living but to Work, an working but to live, as if daily
bread were the only end of wearisome life, and a weari-
some life the only occasion of daily bread. ' '
This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom,
the island ; where I suffered no more corn to grow, be-
cause I did not want it; and bred no more goats, because
I had no more use for them; where the money lay in the
drawer till it grew moldy, and had scarce the favor to be
looked upon in twenty years. All these things, had I
improved them as I ought to have done, and as reason
and religion had dictated to me, would have taught me
to search further than human enjoyments for a full
felicity; and that there was something which certainly
was the reason and end of life superior to all these
things, and which was either to be possessed, or at least
hoped for, on this side of the grave.
. But my sage counselor was gone; I was like a ship
without a pilot, that could only run afore the wind. My
thoughts ran all away again into the old affair ; my head
was quite turned with the whimsies of foreign adven-
tures ; and all the pleasant, innocent amusements of my
farm, my garden, my cattle, and my family, which before
entirely possessed me, were nothing to me, had no relish, ‘
and were like music to one that has no car, or food to
one that has no taste. In a word, I resolved to leave
off housekeeping, let my farm, and return to London;
and in a few months after I did so.
When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I
was before; I had no relish for the place, no employment
in it, nothing to_ do but to saunter about like an idle
person, of whom it may be said he is perfectly useless in
God’s creation, and it is not one farthing’s matter to the
rest of his kind whether he be dead or alive. This also
was the thing which, of all circumstances of life, was the
most my aversion, who had been all my days used to an
active life; and I would often say to myself, “ A state of
idleness is the dregs of life;" and, indeed, I thought I
was much more suitably employed when I was twenty-
six days making a deal board.
» It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my
nephew, whom, as I have observed before, I had brought
up to the sea, and had made him commander of a ship,
was come home from a short voyage to Bilboa, being the
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 271
some merchants of his acquaintance had been proposing
to him to go a voyage for them to the East Indies, and to.
China, as private traders. “ And now, uncle," says he,
“if you will go to sea with me, I will engage to land you
upon your old habitation in the island; for we are to
touch at the Brazils.”
Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future
state, and of the existence of an invisible world, than the
concurrence of second causes with the idea of things
which we form in our minds, perfectly reserved, and not
communicated to any in the world.
My nephew knew nothing how far, my distemper of
wandering was returned upon me, and I knew nothing of
what he had in his thought to say, when that very morn~
ing, before he came to me, I had, in a great deal of con-
fusion of thought, and revolving every part of my cir-
cumstances in my mind, come to this resolution, that I
would go to Lisbon, and consult with my old sea captain;
and if it was rational and practicable, I would go and
see the island again, and what was become of my people
there. ‘I had pleased myself with the thoughts of peo-
pling the place, and carrying inhabitants from hence,
getting a patent for the possession, and I know not what;
when, in the middle of all this, in comes my nephew, as
I have said, with his project of carrying me thither in
his way to the East Indies.
I paused awhile at his words, and looking steadily at
him, “What devil,” said I, “sent you on this unlucky
errand P” My nephew stared as if he had been fright-
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 271
pleased at the proposal, he recoved himself. “ I hope it
may not be an unlucky proposal, sir,” says he. “ I dare
\
say you would be pleased to see your new colony there,
where you once reigned with more felicity tnan most of
your brother monarchs in the world.” In a word, the
scheme hit so exactly with my temper, that is to say, the
prepossession I was under, and of which I have said so
much, that I told him, in a few words, if he agreed with
the merchants, I would go with him; but I told him I
' would not promise to go any further than my own island.
“Why, sir," says he, “you don't want to be left there
again, I hope P" “But,” said I, “ can you not take me
up'again on your return P" He told me it would not be
possible to do so; that the merchants would never allow
him to come that way with a laden ship of such value, it
being a month’s sail out of his way, and might be three
or four. “Besides, sir, if I should miscarry," said he,
“and not return at all, then you would be just reduced
to the condition you were in before."
This was very rational ; but we both found out a tem-
edy for it ; which was, to carry a framed sloop on board
the ship, which being taken in pieces, might by the help
of some carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with us,

sea in a few days. I was not long resolving; for indeed,
the importunities of my nephew joined so effectually
with my inclination, that nothing could oppose me; on
the other hand, my wife being dead, none concerned
themselves so much for me as to persuade me one way
or the other, except my ancient good friend the widow,
who earnestly struggled with me to consider my years,
my easy circumstances, and the needless hazards of a ,
long voyage ; and above all, my young children. But it
was all to no purpose; I had an irresistible desire for the
voyage; and I told her I thought there was somethin
so uncommon in the impressions I had upon my mind,
that it would be a kind of resisting Providence if I
should attempt to stay at home ; after which she ceased
her expostulations, and joined with me, not only in
making provision for my voyage, but also in settling my
my family affairs for my absence, and providing for the
education of my children. In order to do this, I made
my will, and settled the estate I had in such a manner
for my children, and placed in such hands, that I was

nance to herself for her care, all which she richly de-
served; for no mother could have taken more care in
their education, or understood it better; and as she lived
till I came home, I also lived to thank her for it.
My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of
January 1694—5; and I, with my man Friday, went on
board, in the Downs, the 8th; having, besides that sloop
which I mentioned above, a very considerable cargo of
all kinds of necessary things for my colony ; which, if I
ROBINSON causes. 279
First, I carried with me some servants whom I pur-
posed to place there as inhabitants, or at least to set on
work there upon my account, while I stayed, and either
to leave them there or carry them forward, as they should
appear willing; particularly, I carried two carpenters, a
smith, and a very handy, ingenious fellow, who was a
cooper by trade, and was also a general mechanic; for
he was dexterous at making wheels and hand-mills to
grind corn, was a good turner and a good pot-maker;
he also made anything that was proper to make of earth
or of wood: in a word, we called him our Jack-of-all-
trades. With these I carried a tailor, who had offered
himself to go a passenger t0 the East Indies with my
nephew, but afterward consented to stay on our new
plantation, and who proved a most necessary handy tel-
low as could be desired in many other businesses besides
that of his trade ; for, as I observed formerly, necessity

and enough of them, as by my calculation, might com-
fortably supply ’them for seven years; if I remember
right, the materials I carried for clothing them, with
gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as they
could want for wearing, amounted to above two hundred
pounds, including some beds, bedding, and household

pewter, brass, etc.; and near a hundred pounds more in
iron work, nails, tools of every kind, staples, hooks,
hinges, and every necessary thing I could think of. ‘
I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and
fusees; besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of
shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead, and two
pieces of brass cannon; and, because I knew not what
time and What extremities I was providing for, I carried
a hundred barrels of powder, besides swords, cutlasses,
and the iron part of some pikes and halberts. In short,
we had a large magazine of all sorts of store; and I
made my nephew carry two small quarter-deck guns
more than he wanted for his ship, to leave behind if
there was occasion; so that when he came there we
might build a fort and man it against all sorts of ene~

we were obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where

About eight o’clock in the morning we discOvered the
ship’s boats by the help of our perspective glasses, and
found there were two of them, both thronged with peo-
ple, and deep in the water. We perceived they rowed,
the wind being against them; that they saw our ship, and
did their utmost to make us see them. We immediately
spread our ancient, to let them know we saw them, and
hung a waft out, as a signal for them to come on

In little more than half an hour we came up with them,
and took them all in, being no less than sixty-four,

come at that they could not effectually quench it; and
afterward getting in between the timbers, and within the

They had no more to do then but to get into their

them in all these cases, such as storms, to overset and
founder them; rains and cold, to benumb and perish

had escaped.

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures,

a thousand extravaganCes in it. There were some in

he would ; and, with a great deal of seriousness and
affection, but with tears in his eyes, thanked me, that had,

priest applied himself to his countrymen, and labored to
compose them ; he persuaded, entreated, argued, reasoned
with them, and did his utmost to keep them within the
exercise of their reason ; and with some he had success,
though others were for a time out of all government of
themselves.
I can not help committing this to writing, as perhaps it
may be useful to those into whose hands it may fall, for
guiding themselves in the extravagances of their passions ; ‘
for if an excess of joy can carry men out to such a
length beyond the reach of their reason, what will not
the extravagances of anger, rage, and a provoked mind,
carry us to? And, indeed, here I saw reason for keep-
ing an exceeding watch over our passions of every kind,
as well those of joy and satisfaction as those of sorrow and
anger.

but I overruled him in that part, for I knew what it was
to be set on shore in a strange country ; and if the Portu-
guese captain that took me up at sea had served me so,
and taken all I had for my deliverance, I must have been
starved, or have been as much a slave at the Brazils as I
had been at Barbary, the mere being sold to a Mohamme-
dan excepted ; and perhaps a Portuguese is not a much
better master than a Turk, if not in some cases much
worse. -
I therefore told the French captain that we had taken
them up in their distress, it was true, but that it was our
duty to do so, as we were fellow-creatures ; and we would
desire to be so delivered if we were in the like or any other
extremity ; that we had done nothing for them but what
we believed they would have done for us if we had beenin
their case and they in ours ; but that we took them up to
save them, not to plunder them ; and it would be a most
barbarous thing to take that little from them which they

would not let the least thing be taken from them. As to

East Indies ; and though we were driven out of our
course to the westward a very great way, and perhaps were
directed by Heaven on purpose for their deliverance, yet it
was impossible for us willfully to change our voyage on
their particular account ; nor could my nephew, the cap-
tain, answer it to the freighters, with whom he was under
charter to pursue his voyage by way of Brazil; and all
I knew we could do for them was to put ourselves in the
way of meeting with other ships homeward bound from
the West Indies, and get them a passage, if possible, to
England or France.

they could not but be very thankful for it ;‘ but they were
in very great consternation, especially the. passengers, at
the notion of being carried away to the East Indies ; they
then entreated me that as I was driven so far to the west-
ward before I met with them, I would at least keep on
the same conrse to the Banks of Newfoundland, where it
was probable I might meet with some ship or sloop that
they might hire to carry them back to Canada.
I‘thought this was but a reasonable request on their
part, and therefore I inclined to agree to it ; for indeed I
considered that to carry this whole company to the East
Indies would not only be an intolerable severity upon the
poor people, but would be ruining our whole voyage Hy de-
vouring all our provisions; so I thought it no breach of
charter-party, but what an unforseen accident made abso-
lutely necessary to us, and in which no one could say we
were to blame; for the laws of God and nature would
forbid that we should refuse to take up two boats full of
people in such a distressed condition ;and the nature of
the thing, as well respecting ourselves as the poor people,
obliged us to set them on shore somewhere or other for
their deliverance. So I consented that we would carry
them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would permit;
and if not, I would carry them to Martinico, in the West
Indies. '
The wind continued fresh easterly, but the Weather
pretty good ; and as the winds had continued in the points
between and S.E. a long time, we missed several op-
portunities of sending them to France, for we met several
ships bound to Europe, whereof two were French, from
St. Christopher’s, but they had been so long beating up
against the wind that they durst take in no passengers, for
fear of wanting provisions for the voyage, as well for them-
selves as for those they should take in; so we were obliged
to go on. It was about a week after this that we made the
Banks of Newfoundland ; where, to shorten my story, we
put all our French people On board a bark, which they
hired at sea there, to put them on shore, and afterward to
carry them to France, if they could get provisions to
victual themselves with. When I say all the French went _
on shore, I should remember that the young priest I spoke
of, hearing we were bound to the East ’Indies, desired to
go on the voyage with us. and to be set on shore on the
coast of Coromandel; which I readily agreed to, for I
wonderfully liked the man, and had very good reason,
as will appear afterward; also four of the seamen en-
tered themselves on our ship, and proved very useful
fellows.
From hence we directed our course for the West Indies,
steering away S. and S. by E. for about twenty days to-
gether, sometimes little or no wind at all ; when we met
with another subject for'our humanity to work upon“

tress. The weather was pretty good, wind at N.N.W. a
fresh gale, and we soon came to speak with her. We found
her a ship of Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, but had
been blown out of the road at Barbadoes a few days be-
fore she was ready to sail, by a terrible hurricane, while I

with another terrible storm, after the hurricane was over
which had blown them quite out of their knowledge to

told us they expected to have seen the Bahama Islands,
but were then driven away again to the south-east, by a
strong gale of wind at N. N. W,, the .same that blew
now; and having no sails to work the ship with but a
main course, and a kind of square sail upon a jury
foremast, which they had set up, they could not lie near
the wind, but were endeavoring to stand away for the
Canaries.
But that which was worst of all was that they were

all devoured ; and they had seven casks of rum. There
was a ,youth, and his mother, and a maid-servant on
board, who were passengers, and thinking the Ship was
ready to sail, unhappily came on board the evening
before the hurricane began; and having no provisions
of their own left, they were in a more deplorable con-
dition than the rest: for the seamen, being reduced to
such an extreme necessity themselves, had no compassion,
we may be sure, for the poor passengers ; and they were,
indeed, in such a condition that their misery is very hard
to describe.
I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had
not led me (the weather being fair, and the wind abated)
to go on board the ship. The second mate, who upon
this occasion commanded the ship, had been on board
our ship, and he told ,me they had three passengers in
the great cabin that were in a deplorable condition.
“Nay,” says he, “I believe they are dead, for I have
heard nothing of them for above two days; and I was
afraid to inquire after them," said he, “for I had noth-
ing to relieve them with." We immediately applied
ourselves to give them what relief we could spare; and,
indeed, I had so far overruled things with my nephew,
that I would have victualed them, though we had gone
away to Virginia, or any other part of the coast of America,
to have supplied ourselves; but there was no necessity
for that.
But now they were in a new danger; for they were
afraid of eating too much, even of that little we gave
them. The mate, or commander, brought six men with
him in his boat;_ but these poor wretches looked like
skeletons, and were so weak that they could hardly sit to
their oars. The mate himself was very ill, and half-starved;
for he declared he had reserved nothing from the men,
and went share and share alike with them in every bit they
eat. I cautioned him to eat sparingly, and set meat before
him immediately, but he had not eaten three mouthfuls be-
fore he began to be sick and out of order ; so he stopped
awhile, and our surgeon mixed him up something with
some broth, which he said would be to him both food and
physic; and after he had taken it he grew better. In
the meantime I forgot not the men. I ordered victuals
to be given them, and the poor creatures rather de-
voured than eat it; they were vso exceedingly hungry
that they were in a manner ravenous, and had no com-
mand of themselves ; and two of them eat with so much
greediness that they were in danger of their lives the
next morning. The sight of these people’s distress was
very moving to me, and brought to mind what 1 had a

island, where I had not the least mouthful of food, or
any prospect of procuring any; besides the hourly ap-
prehensions I had of being made the food of other crea-
tures. But allythe while the mate was thus relating to
me the miserable condition of the ship’s company, I could
not put out of my thought the story he had told me
of the three poor creatures in the great cabin—viz., the
mother, her son, and the maid-servant, whom he had heard
nothing of for two or three days, and whom,he seemed to
confess, they had wholly neglected, their own extremities
being so great ; by which I understood that they had
really given them no food at all, and that therefore they
must be perished, and be all lying dead, perhaps, on the
floor or deck of the cabin.
As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called cap-
tain, on board with his men, to refresh them, so I also for-
got not the starving crew that were left on board, but
ordered my own boat to go on board the ship, and, with,
‘ my mate and twelve men, to carry them a sack of bread,

charged the men to cause the meat to be boiled while they
stayed, and to keep guard in [the cook-room, to pre-
vent the men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of
the pet before it was well boiled, and then to give every
man but a very little at a time; and by this caution he pre-
served the men, who would otherwise have killed them-_
selves with that very food that was given them on purpose
to save their lives. 7
At the same time I ordered the mate to go into the great
cabin, and see what condition the poor passengers were in;
and if they were alive, to comfort them, and give them
what refreshment was proper : and the surgeon gave him
a large pitcher, with some of the prepared broth which he
had given the mate that was on board, and which hp did
not question would restore them gradually. I was not

to See the scene of misery which I knew the ship itself Would
present me with, in a more lively manner than I could have
it by report,- I took the captain of the ship, as we now
called him, with me, and Went myself, a little after, in their
boat.
I found the poor men oh board almost in a tymult to
get the victuals out of the boiler before it was ready ; but
my mate observed his orders, and kept a good guard at
the cook-room door ; and the man he placed there, after
using all possible persuasion to have patience, kept them
off by force ; however, he caused some biscuit cakes to be
dipped in the pot, and softened with the liquor of the
meat, which they call brewis, and gave them every
one some to stay their stomachs, and told them it Was
for their own safety that he was obliged to giVe them
but little at a time. But it was all in_vain; and had

were lashed fast, and her head sunk between her shoulders
_ like a corpse, though not quite dead. My mate said all he
could to revive and encourage her, and with a spoon put
some broth into her mouth. »She opened her lips, and
lifted up one hand, but could not speak: yet she under-
stood What he said, and made signs to him, intimating
that it was too late for her, but pointed to her child, as if
she would have said they should take care of him. How-
ever, the mate, who was exceedingly moved at the sight,
endeavored to get some of the broth into her mouth, and,
as he said, got two or three spoonfuls down—though I
question whether he could be sure of it or not : but it was
too late, and she died the same night.
The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most
affectionate mother’s life, was not so far gone ; yet he lay
in a cabin bed, as one stretched out, with hardly any life
left in him. He had a piece of an old glove in his mouth,
having eaten up the rest of it; however, being' young, and
having more strength than his mother, the mate got some-
thing down his throat, and he began sensibly to revive;
though by giving him, some time after, but two or three
spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and brought“ it
up again.
But the next care was the poor maid : she lay all along
upon the deck, hard by her mistress, and just like one

clasped round the frame of the chair, and she gripped it
so hard that we could not easily make her let it go ; her
other arm lay over her head, and her feet lay both together,
set fast a ainst the frame of the cabin table : in short, she
lay just 11 e one in the agonies of death, and yet she was
alive, too. \ The poor creature was not only starved with

could spare; and taking three casks of sugar, some rum,
and some pieces of eight from them for satisfaction, we
left them, taking on board with us, at their own earnest
request, the youth and the maid, and all their goods.
The young lad was about seventeen years of age, a’
pretty, well-bred, modest, and sensible youth, greatly de-
jected with the loss of his mother, and also at having lost
his father but a few months before, at Barbadoes. He
begged of the surgeon to speak to me to take him out of
the ship; for he said the cruel fellows had murdered his
mother: and, indeed, so they had, that is to say, passively:
for they might have spared a small sustenance to the poor
helpless widow, though it had been "but just enough to
keep her alive; but hunger knows no friend, no relation,
no justice, no right, and therefore is remorseless, and
capable of no compassion.
The surgeon told him how far we were going, and that
it would carry him away from all his friends, and put him,
perhaps, in as bad circumstances almost as those we found
him in—that is to say, starving in the world. He said it
mattered not whither he went, if he was but delivered
from the terrible crew that he was among; that the cap-
tain (by which he meant me, for he could know nothing
of my nephew) had saved his life, and he was sure would
not hurt him; and as for the maid, he was sure, if she
came to herself, she would be very thankful for it,
and let us carry them where we would. The surgeom
represented the case so effectually to me that I yielded,
and we took them both on board, with all their goods, ex-
cept eleven hogsheads of sugar, which could not be re-
moved or come at; and as the youth had a bill of lading
for them, I made his commander sign a writing, obliging
himself to go, as soon as he came to Bristol, to one Mr.
Rogers, a merchant there, to whom the youth said he was
related, and to deliver a letter which I wrote to him, and
all the goods he had belonging to the deceased widow;
which. I suppose, was not done, for I could never learn
that the ship came to Bristol, but was, as is most probable,

shall observe that I came to my old habitation, the island,

that I found the place; for as I came to it and went
to it before on the south and east side of the island, com-
ing from the Brazils, so now, coming in between the main
and the island, and having no chart for the coast, nor any
landmark, I did not know it when I saw it, or know
whether I saw it or not. We heat about a great while,
and went on shore on several islands in the mouth of the
great river Oronooque, but none for my purpose; only this
I learned by my coasting the shore, that I was under one
great mistake before—viz., that the continent which I
thought I saw from the island I lived in was really no con-
tinent, but a long island, or rather a ridge of islands,
reaching from one to the other side of the extended
mouth of that great river; and that the savages who came
to my island were not properly those which we call Carib-
bees, but islanders, and other barbarians of the same
kind, who inhabited nearer to our side than the rest.
In short, I visited several of these islands to no purpose;
some I found were inhabited, and some were not ; on one
of them I found some Spaniards, and thought they had
lived there; but speaking with them, found they had a

found I was not there.
As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were
left behind, and of whom, he said, he had a long story to
tell me, the Spaniards all thought themselves much better
among the savages, only that their number was so small,
“ And," says he, had they been strong enough, we had‘

himself on the breast. “ But, sir,” says he, “I hope you
will not be displeased when I shall tell you how, forced by
necessity, we were obliged, for our own preservation, to
disarm them,'and make them our subjects, as they would
not be content with being moderately our masters, but
would be our murderers.” I answered I was afraid of

While I was thus saying this, the man came whom he
had sent back, and with him eleven more. In the dress
they were in it was impossible to guess what nation they
were of ; but he made all clear, both to them and to me.
First, he turned to me, and pointing to them, said, “ These,
sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to you ;"
and then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them
know who I was ; upon which they all came up, one by one,
not as if they had been sailors, and ordinary fellows, and the
like, but really as if they had been ambassadors or noble-
men, and I a monarch or great conqueror; their behavior
was to thelast degree, obliging and courteous, and yet mixed
with a manly, majestic gravity, which very well became them;
and, in short, they had so much more manners than I, that I
scarce knew how to receive their civilities, much less how to
return them in kind.

next morning. It seems they wanted notime to get them-
selves ready ; for they had neither clothes, nor provisions,
nor anything in the world ‘but what they had on them,
and a few roots to eat, of which they used to make their
bread. They were in all three weeks absent ; and in thatv
time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered for
my escape, as I mentioned in the other part, and to get
off from the island,_leaving three of the most impudent,
hardened, ungoverned, disagreeable villains behind me
that any man could desire to meet with—to the poor
Spaniards’ great grief and disappointment.
The only just thing the rogues did was, that when the
Spaniards came ashore, they gave my letter to them, and
gave them provisions, and other relief, as I had ordered
them to do; also they gave them the long paper of direc-
tions which I had left with them, containing the particular
methods which I took for managing every part of my life
there; the way I baked my bread, bred up tame goats,
and planted my corn ; how I cured my grapes, made my
pots, and, in a word, everything I did. All this being
written down, they gave to the Spaniards (two of them
understood English well enough): nor did they refuse to
accommodate the Spaniards with anything else, for they
agreed very well for some time. They gave them an
equal admission into the house or cave, and they began
to live very sociably ; and the head Spaniard, who had
seen pretty much of my methods, together with F riday's
father, managed all their affairs ; but as for the English-
l
men, they did nothing but ramble about the island, shoot
parrots, and catch tortoises; and when they came home at
night, the Spaniards provided their suppers for them.

relation of it came from the Spaniards themselves, whom
I may call the accusers, yet when I came to‘ examine the
fellows they could not deny a word of it.
But before I come to the particulars of this part, I must
supply a defect in my former relation; and this was, I for-
got to set down among the rest, that just as we were
weighing the anchor to set sail, there happened a little
quarrel on board of our ship, which I was once afraid
would have turned to a second mutiny; nor was it ap—
peased till the captain, rousing up his courage, and taking
us all to his assistance, parted them by force, and making
two of the most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them
in irons: and as they had been active in the former dis~
orders, and let fall some ugly, dangerous words the second
time, he threatened to carry them in irons to England,
and have them hanged there for mutiny and running away
with the ship. This, it seems, though the captain did not
intend to do it, frightened some other men in the ship;
and some of them had put it into the head ofvthe rest that
the captain only gave them good words for the present,
till they should come to some English port, and that then
they should be all put into jail, and tried for their lives.
The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us with
it, upon which it was desired that I, who still passed for a
great man among them, should go down with the mate
and satisfy the men, and tell them that they might vbe as-
sured, if they behaved well the rest'of the voyage, all they
had done for the time past should be pardoned. So I
went, and after passing my honor's word to them they
appeared easy, and the more so when I caused the two
men that were in irons to be released and forgiven.
But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for the
night; the wind also falling calm next morning, we found,
, that our two men, who had been laid in irons, had stolen
each of them a musket and some other weapons (what
powder or shot they had we knew not), and had taken the
ship’s pinnace, whichwas not yet hauled up, and run away
with her to their companions in roguery on shore. As
soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat on shore,
with twelve men and the mate, and away they went to seek

boat coming on shore. The mate was once resolved, in
justice to their roguery, to have destroyed their planta-
tions, burned all their household stuff and furniture, and
left them to shift without it ; but having no orders, he let
it all alone, left everything as he found it, and bringing
the pinnace away, came on board without them. These
‘ ROBINSON CRUSOE. 303
lains were much more wicked than they, that after they
had been two or three days together they turned the two
new-comers out-of-doors to shift- for themselves, and would
have nothing to do with them ; nor could they for a good
while be persuaded to give them any food; as for the
Spaniards, they were not yet come.

the three English brutes to have taken in their country-

pitched their tents on the north shore of the island, but a
little more to the west, to be out of danger of the savages,

they built them two huts, one to lodge in and the other to
lay up their magazines and stores in ; and the Spaniards
having given them some corn for seed,and some of the

They were going on in this little thriving position when
the three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen, too, in
mere humor, and to insult them, came and bullied them,
and told them the island was theirs: that the governor,
meaning me, had given them the possessionof it, and no-
body else had any right to it ; and that they should build

for them. The two men,thinking they were jesting at

they were the ground landlords, he hoped if they built
tenements upon their land, and made improvements, they
would, according to the custom of landlords, grant a long
lease : and-desired they would get a scrivener to draw the
writings. One of the three, cursing and raging, told them

they resolved to go to the castle (as they called my old
dwelling), where the three rogues and the Spaniards all
lived together at that time, intending to have a fair battle,
and the Spaniards should stand by to see fair play; so they
got up in the morning before day, and came to the
place, and called the Englishmen by their names, tell-
ing a Spaniard that answered that they wanted to speak
with them.
It happened that the day before two of the Spaniards,
having beenin the woods, had seen one of the two English-
men, whom, for distinction, I called the honest men, and
he had made a sad complaint to the Spaniards of the bar-
barous usage they had met with from their three country-
men, and how they had ruined their plantation, and de-v

stroyed their corn, that they had labored so hard to bring
forward, and killed the milch-goat and their three kids,
which was all they had provided for their sustenance, and
that if he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not
assist them again, they should be starved. When the
Spaniards came home at night, and they were all.at sup-
per, one of them took the freedom to reprove the three
Englishmen, though in very gentle and mannerly terms,
and asked them how they could be so cruel, they being
harmless, inoffensive fellows; that they were putting them-
selves in a way to subsist by their labor, and that it had
,cost them a great deal of pains to bring things to such
perfection as they were then in.
One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, “What
had they to do-there? that they came on shore without
leave ; and that they should not plant or build upon the
island; it was/none of their ground." “Why,” says the
Spaniard, very calmly, “ Senor Inglese, they must not
starve.” The Englishman replied, like a rough tarpaulin,
“ They might starve; they should not plant nor build in
that place.” “ But what must they do then, senor ?" said
the Spaniard. Another of the brutes returned, “ Do?
they should be servants, and work for them." “ But
how can you expect that of them P" says the Spaniard;
“ they are not bought with your money; you have no right
to make them servants." The Englishmen answered,
“The island was theirs; the governor had given- it to
them, and no man had anything to do there but them-
selves;"and with that he swore that he would go and burn
all their new huts; they should build none upon their land.
“Why, senor,” says the Spaniard, “by the same rule, we
must be your servants, too.” “Ay,” returned the bold
dog, “and so you shall, too, before we have done with
you;" mixing two or three oaths in the proper intervals
of his speech. The Spaniard only smiled at that, and
made him no answer. However, this little discourse had
heated them ; and starting up, one says to the other (I
think it was be they called Will Atkins), “Come, Jack,
let's go and have t'other brush with them ; we'll demolish
their castle, I’ll warrant you ; they shall plant no colony
in our dominions.”
Upon this they were all trooping away, with every man
a gun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent
l
l ,
things among themselves of what they would do to the
Spaniards, too, when opportunity offered ; but the Span-
iards, it seems, did not so perfectly understand them as to
know all the particulars, only that in general they threat-
ened them hard for taking the two Englishmen’s part.
Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time that
evening, the Spaniards said they did not know ; but it
seems they wandered about the country part of the night,
and then lying down in the place which I used to call my
bower, they were weary and overslept themselves. The
case was this: they had resolved to stay till midnight, and
so take the two poor men when they were asleep, and as

huts while they were in them, and either burn them there
or murder them as they came out. As malice seldom
sleeps very sound, it was very strange they should not
have been kept awake. However, as the two men had also
a design upon them, as I have said, though a much faire"v
one than that, of burning and murdering, it happened, and
very luckily for them all, that they were up and gone’
abroad before the bloody-minded rogues came to their
huts. ~

indeed, to anything, but they pulled down both their
houses, not leaving the least stick standing, or scarce any
sign on the ground where they stood ; they tore all their
household stuff in pieces, and threw everything about in
such a manner, that the poor men afterward found some
of their things a mile off. When they had done this, they
pulled up all the young trees which the poor men had
planted; broke vdown an inclosure they made to secure
their cattle and their corn; and, in a word, sacked and
plundered everything as completely as a horde of Tartars
would have done.

When they were thus disarmed, and found they had

Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and with
great reluctance ; but the Spaniards protested that they
did it only to keep them. from bloodshed, and to make
them all easy at last. “ For, said they, “ we are not so

the governor, and two more with him, walking by the side ‘
of the creek, they came up in a very submissive, humble
manner, and begged to be received again into the society.
The Spaniards used them civilly, but told them they had
acted so unnaturally to their countrymen, and so very
grosslv to themselves, that they could not come to any con-
clusion without consulting the two Englishmen and the
rest ; but, however, they would go to them and discourse
about it, and they should know in half an hour. It may
be guessed that they were very hard put to it; for, as they
were to wait this half hour for an answer, they begged
they would send them out some bread in the meantime,
which they did, sending at the same time a large piece of

eagerly.
After half an hour's consultation they were called in,
and a long debate ensued, their two countrymen charging
them with the ruin ofv all their labor, and a design to mur-
der them;all which they owned before, and therefore
could not deny now. Upon the whole, the Spaniards
acted the moderators betWeen them; and as they had
obliged two Englishmen not to hurt the three while
they were naked and unarmed. so they now obliged
the three to go and rebuild their fellows’ two huts,
one to be of the same and the other of larger dimen-
sions than they were before; to fence their ground again,
plant trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up the land
‘ut’a
again for planting corn, and, in a word, to restore every-
thing to the same state as they found it, that is, as near as
' they could. ‘
Well, they submitted to all this ; and as they had plenty
of provisions given them all the while, they grew very
orderly, and the whole society began to live pleasantly
and agreeably together again ; only that these three fel-
lows could never be persuaded to work—I mean for
themselves—except now and then a little, just as they
pleased; however, the Spaniards told them plainly that
if they would but live sociably and friendly together,
and study the good of the whole plantation, they would be
content to work for them, and let them walk about and be
as idle as they pleased; and thus, having lived pretty well
together for a. month or two, the Spaniards let them have
arms again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with them
as before.
It was not above a week after they had these arms, and
went abroad, before the ungrateful creatures began to .1
be as insolent and troublesome as ever; however, an
accident happened presently upon this, which endangered
the safety of them all, and they were obliged to lay by
all private resentments, and look to the preservation of
their lives.
It happened one night that the governor, the Spaniard
whose life I had saved, who was now the governor of the
rest, found himself very uneasy in the night, and could by
no means get any sleep: he! was perfectly well in body,
only found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran upon

awake, and could not by any means get any sleep; in short,
he lay a great while, but growing more and more uneasy,
he resolved to rise. As they lay, being so many of them,
on goat-skins laid thick upon such couches and pads as
they made for themselves, so they had little to do, when
they were willing to rise, but to get upon their feet, and
perhaps put on a coat, such as it was, and their pumps,
and they were ready for going any way that their thoughts
guided them. Being thus got up, he looked out ; but
being dark, he could see little or nothing, and besides, the
trees which I had planted, and which were now grown
tall, intercepted his sight, so that he could only look up,
and see that it was a starlight night, and hearing no noise,

he returned and lay down again ; but to no purpose; as
could not compose himself to anything like test ; bht his‘
thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, and he knew not
for what. Having made some noise with rising and 'walk-
ing about, going out and coming in, another of them
waked, and asked who it was that was up. The governor
told him how it had been with him. “ Say you so i " says
the other Spaniard ; “ such things are not to be slighted, I
assure you ; there is certainly some mischief Working near
us ; ” and presently he asked him, “ Where are the English-

Among the precautions I used to take on/the savages

them making the least discovery of there being any in- ‘ '

they came to know it, they felt it SO effectually that they

and by accident, on'their usual bloody errand, the Spam-
.iargls pould not understand ; but whatever it was, it was
their business either to have Qoncealed themselves pr not
to have seen them at all, much less to have let the savages
have seen there were any inhabitants in the place; or to
have fallen upon them so effeptually as not a man of them
should have escaped, which coulgl only have been by get-
ting in between them and their boats ; but this presence
of mind was wanting to them, which was the ruin of their
tranquillity for a great while.

done, for they were some of them two miles off from
the other ; and, as it appeared afterward, were of two dif-

After having mused a great while on the course they
should take, they resolved at last, while it was still dark,
to send the old savage, Friday's father, out as a spy, to

people to lie close, and not be seen ; he told them their
safety consisted in it, and they had nothing to do but
lie still, and the savages would kill one another to their
hands, and then the rest would go away ; and it was so
to a tittle. But it was impossible to prevail, especially
upon the Englishmen ; their curiosity was so importunate
that they must run out and see the battle ; however, they
used some caution, too ; they did not go' openly, just by

running as into a thick wood for shelter, The scout they
kept to look abroad gave notice of this within, with this
comforting addition, that the conquerers had not pursued
them, or seen which way they were gone ; upon this, the
Spanish governor, a man of humanity, would not suffer
them to kill the three fugitives, but sending three men
out by the top of the hill, ordered them to 'go round, come
in behind them, and surprise and take them prisoners;

the consequences appeared terrible to the last degree,

friends—for common danger, as I said above, had effect-

ROBINSON cnusos. 3:7
consideration was whether, seeing the savages particularly
haunted that side of the island, and that there were more
remote and retired parts of it equally adapted to their way
of living, and manifestly to their advantage, they should
not rather move their habitation, and plant in some more
proper place for their safety, and especially for the
security of their cattle and corn. 1
Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that they
would not remove their habitation; because that, some
time or other, they thought they might hear from their
governor again, meaning me; and if I should send any one
to seek them, I should be sure to direct them to that side,

would conclu e the savages had killed us all, and we were
gone, and so our supply would go too. But, as to their
corn and cattle, they agreed to remove them into the val-
ley where my cave was, where the land was as proper for
both, and where indeed,there was land enough. However,
upon second thoughts, they altered one part of their res-
olution too, and resolved only to remove part of their cat-
tle thither, and plant part of their corn there ; so that if
one part was destroyed, the other might be saved. And
one part of prudence they luckily used; they never trusted
those three savages which they had taken prisoners with
knowing anything of the plantation they had made in that
valley, or of any cattle they had there, much less of the
cave at that place, which they kept, in case of necessity,
as a safe retreat; and thither they carried also the two
barrels of powder which I had sent them at my coming
away. They resolved, however, not to change their habi—

in their being concealed, they set to work to cover and
conceal the place yet more effectually than before. For
this purpose, as I planted trees, or rather thrust in stakes,

leaving any place to land, or any sign that there had been
any landing thereabouts—these stakes also being of a
wood very forward to grow, they took care to have them
generally much larger and taller than those which I had
planted. As they grew apace, they planted them so very
thick and close together, that when they had been three
or four years grown there was no piercing with the eye
any considerable way into the plantation. As for that
part which I had planted, the trees were grown as thick
as a man’s thigh, and among them, they had placed so
many other short ones, and so thick, that it stood like a
palisado a quarter of a mile thick, and it was next to im-
possible to penetrate it, for a little dog could hardly get
between the trees, they stood so close. .
But this was not all; for they did the same by all the
ground to the right hand and to the left, and round even
to the side of the hill, leaving no way, not so much as for
themselves, to come out but by the ladder placed up to

was taken down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft
to assist it could come at them. This was excellently well
contrived; nor was it less than what they afterward found
occasion for, which served to convince me, that as human’
prudence has the authority of Providence to justify it, so-
it has doubtless the direction of Providence to set it to
work; and if we listened carefully to the voice of it, I am
persuaded we might prevent many of the disasters which
our lives are now, by our own negligence, subjected to.
They lived two years after this in perfect retirement,
and had no more visits from the savages.‘ They had, in-
deed, an alarm given them one morning, which put them
into a great consternation; for some of the Spaniards being
out early one morning on the west side or end of the




island (which was that end where I never went, for fear
of being discovered), they were surprised with seeing
about twenty canoes of Indians just coming on shore.
They made the best of their way home in hurry enough ;
and giving the alarm to their comrades, they kept close
all that day and the next, going outfonly at night to make
their observation; but they had the good luck to be undis-
covered, for wherever the savages went, they did not land
that time on the island, but pursued some other design.

AND now they had another’broil with the three English-
men ; one of whom, a most turbulent fellow, being in a
rage at one of the three captive slaves, because the fellow _
had not done something right which he bade him do, and
seemed a little untractable in his showing him, drew a
hatchet out Of a frog-belt which he wore by his side, and
fell upon the poor savage, not to correct him, but to kill
him. One of the Spaniards, who was by, seeing him give
the fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which be
aimed at his head, but stuck into his shoulder, so that he
thought he had cut the poor creature’s arm Off, ran to
him, and, entreating him not to murder the poor man,
placed himself between him and the savage, to prevent the
mischief. The fellow, being enraged the more at this,
struck at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he
would serve him as he intended to serve the savage;,
which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and

made at the two last Spaniards, and wounded them both.
This fray set the whole family in an uproar, and more
help coming in, they took the three Englishmen prisoners.
The next question was, what should be done with,
them? They had been so often mutinous, and were
so,very furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, they
knew not what course to take with them, for they Were
mischievous to the highest degree, and cared not what
hurt they did to any man; so that, in short, it was not
safe to live with them.
The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many
words, that if they had been of his own country he would
have hanged them ; for all laws and all governors were to
preserve society, and those who were dangerous to the
society ought to be expelled out of it; but as they were
Englishmen, and that it was to the generous kindness or i
an Englishman that they all owed their preservation and
deliverance, he would use them with all possible lenity,
and would leave them to the judgment of the other two
Englishmen, who were their countrymen. One of the
two honest Englishmen stood up, and said they desired it
might not be left to them. “ For,” says he, ‘- I am sure
we ought to sentence them to the gallows ; and with that.

and murder all the Spaniards when they were in their
sleep. ,
When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will
Atkins, “ How, Senor Atkins, would you murder us all?
What have you to say to that? ’ The hardened villain was
so far from denying it, that he said it was true, and swore
they would do it still before they had done with them.
“ Well, but, Senor Atkins,” says the Spaniard, “what
have we done to you that you will kill us? What would
you get by killing us? And what must we do to prevent
you killing us? Must we kill you,'or you kill us? Why
will you put us to the necessity of this, Senor Atkins ? " ‘
says the Spaniard, very calmly, and smiling. Senor Atkins
was in such a rage at the Spaniards" making a jest of it,
that, had he not been held by three men, and withal had‘
no weapon near him, it was thought he would have at-
tempted to kill the Spaniard in the middle of all the com-
pany. This hair-brain carriage obliged them to consider

seriously what was to be done. The two Englishmen,
and the Spaniard who saved the poor savage, were of the
opinion that they should hang one of the three for an ex-
ample to the rest, and that particularly it should be he
that had twice attempted to commit murder with his
hatchet; indeed, there was some reason to believe he had
done it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable con-
dition with the wound he had received that it was thought
he could not live. But the governor Spaniard still ’s’aid
no ; it was an Englishman that had saved all their lives,
and he would never consent to put an Englishman to
death, though he had murdered half of them; nay, he
said if he had been killed himself by an Englishman, and
had time left to speak, it should be that they should par-
don him.
This was so positively insisted on by the governor Span-
iard,‘that there was no gainsaying it ; and as merciful
counsels are most apt to prevail where they are so earn-
estly pressed, so they all came into it; but then it was to
be cOnsidered what should be done to keep them from
doing the mischief they designed; for'they all agreed,
governor and all, that means were to be used for preserv~
ing the society from danger. After a long debate, it was
agreed that they should be disarmed, and not permitted
to have either gun, powder, shot, sword, or any weapon;
that they should be turned out of the society, and left
to live where they would, by themselves ; and that
none of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should
‘ hold any kind of converse with them, or have any-
thing to do with them; that they should be forbid to
come within a certain distance of the place where the
rest dwelled; and if they offered to commit any dis-
order, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of the
corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the
society,they should die without mercy, and would shoot

long ere they can raise corn and cattle of their own, and
they must not starve ; we must therefore allow them pro-
visions.” So be. caused to be added, that they should
have a proportion of corn given them to last them eight
months, and for seed to sow, by which time they might be
supposed to raise some of their own ; that they should
have six milch-goats, four he-goats, and six kids given
them, as well for present subsistence as for a store ; and
that they should have tools given them for their work in

provisions unless they would swear solemnly that they
would not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with them,
or any 'of their fellow-Englishmen.
Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them
out to shift for themselves. They went away sullen and
refractory, as neither content ‘to go away nor to stay ; but,
as there was no remedy, they went, pretending to go and
choose a place where they would settle themselves; and .
some provisions were given them, but no weapons. About

and gave the governor an account where they had pitched
their tents, and marked themselves out a habitation and
plantation ; and it was a very convenient place indeed, on
the remotest part of the island, N. E., much about the

would be very easily COVered from the sight, unless narrow-
ly searched for. They desired some dried goat-skins for,

and what other tools they could spare ; some pease, barley,

except arms and ammunition.
They lived in this separate condition about six months,

but small, the parcel of land they had planted being but
little. Indeed, having all their plantation to form, they \
had a great deal of work upon their hands. and when they
came to make boards and pots, and such things, they were
Quite out of their element, and could make nothing of it;
therefore when the rainy season came on, for want of a
M
v-
cave in the earth, they could not keep their grain dry, and
it was in great danger of spoiling. This humbled them
much : so they came and begged the Spaniards to help
them, which they very readily did ; and in four days
worked a great hole in the side of the hill for them,
big enough to secure their corn and other things from
the rain ; but it was a poor place _at best compared
to mine, and especially as mine wasthen, for the Span-
iards had greatly enlarged it, and made several new apart-
.ments in it.
About three quarters of a year after this separation, at
new frolic took these rogues, which, together With the for-
mer villainy they had commited, brought mischief enough
upon them, and had very near been the ruin of the whole
colony. The three new associates began, it seems, to be
weary of the laborious life they led, and that without hope
of bettering their circumstances ; and a whim took them
that they would make a voyage to the continent, from
whence the savages came, and would try if they could seize
upon some prisoners among the natives there, and bring
them home, so as to make them do the laborious part of
the work for them.
The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone
no further. But they did nothing, and proposed nothing,
but had either mischief in the design, or mischief in the
event. And if I may give my opinion, they seemed to be
under a blast from Heaven: for if we will not allow a
visible curse to pursue visible crimes, how shall we recon-
cile the events of things with the divine justice? It was
certainly an apparent vengeance on their crime of mutiny
and piracy that brought them to the state they were in ;
and they showed not the least remorse for the crime, but
added new villainies to it, such as the piece of monstrous
cruelty of wounding a poor—slave because he did not, or
.perhaps could not, understand to do what he was directed,
and to wound him in such a manner as made him a cripple
all his life, and in a place where no surgeon or medicine
could be had for his cure ; and, what was still worse, the
intentional murder, for such to be sure it was, as was after-'
ward the formed design they all laid to murder the Span-l
iards in cold blood, and in their sleep. .
The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one
'morning, and in very humble terms desired to be admitted
w'
to speak with them. The Spaniards very readily neard
what they had to say, which was this : that they were
tired of living in the manner they did, and that they were
not handy enough to make the necessaries they wanted,
and that having no help, they found they should be
starved; but if the Spaniards would give them leave to
take one of the canoes which they came over in, and give
them arms and ammunition proportioned to their defense,
they would go over to the main, and seek their fortunes,
and so deliver them from the trouble of supplying them
with any other provisions. . ‘
The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but
very honestly represented to them the certain destruction
they were running into ; told them they had suffered such
hardships upon that very spot, that they could, without
any spirit of prophecy, tell them they would be starved or
murdered, and bade them consider of it. The men replied
audaciously, they should be starved if they stayed here,
for they could not work, and would not work, and they
could but be starved abroad ; and if they were murdered,
there was an end of them ; they had no wives or children
to cry after them ; and, in short, insisted importunely upon
their demand, declaring they would go, whether they gave
them any arms or not. t
The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if
they were resolved to go they should not go like naked
men,and be in no condition to defend themselves; and
324, ‘ ROBINSON cnusoa.
enough for themselves, yet they would let them have two
muskets, a pistol, and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet,

over the sea, where it "was at least forty miles broad. The

made a mast of a long pole, and a sail of four large goat-
skins dried, which they had sewed or laced together; and -
away they went merrily together. The Spaniards called
after them “ Ban Voyajo .' " and no man ever thought of
seeing them any more.
The Spaniards were often saying to one another, and to
the two honest Englishmen who remained behind, how
quietly and comfortably they lived, now these three turbu-
lent fellows were gone. As for their coming again, that
was the remotest thing from their thoughts that could be
imagined ; when, behold, after two-and-twenty days’ ab-
sence, one of the Englishmen being abroad upon his plant-
ing work, sees three strange men coming toward him at a.
distance, with guns upon their shoulders. '
Away runs the Englishman, frightened and amazed, as
if he was bewitched, to the governor Spaniard, and tells
'him they were all undone, for there were strangers upon
the island, but he could not tell who they were. The
Spaniard, pausing awhile, says to him, “ How do you
mean—you can not tell who ? They are the savages, to be
sure." “ No, no,” says the Englishman, “ they are men
in clothes, with arms.” “ Nay. then,” says the Spaniard,
“ why are you so concerned P If they are not savages they
must befriends; for there is no Christian nation upon
earth but will do us good rather than harm." While they
were debating thus, came up the three Englishmen, and
standing without the wood, which was new planted,
hallooed to them. They presently knew their voices, and
so all the wonder ceased. But now the admiration was
turned upon another question: What could be the matter,
and what made them come back again ?
It was not long before they brought the men in, and in-
quiring wnere they had been, and what they had been
doing, they gave them a full account of their voyage in a
few words: That they reached the land in less than two

seven hours, till they came to a great opening, by which
they perceived that the land they saw from our island was
not the main, but an island: that upon entering that open-
ing of the sea they saw another island on‘s'the right hand
north, and several more west ; and being resolved to land
somewhere, they put over to one of the islands which lay
West, and went boldly on shore; that they found the peo-

very forward to supply them with anything they could get
for them to eat, and brought it to them a great way, on
their heads. They continued here four days, and inquired,
as well as they could of them by signs, what nations were

made known by'signs to them, used to eat men ; but, as
for themselves, they said they never eat men or women,
except only such as they took in the wars ; and then they

The Englishmen inquired when they had had a feast of

king had two hundred prisoners now, which he had taken
in his war, and they were feeding them to make them fat
for the next feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty de-
sirous of seeing those prisoners ; but the others mistaking
them, thought they were desirous to have some of them to
carry away for their eating. So they beckoned to them,
pointing to the setting of the sun, and then to the rising;

on their voyage, just as he would bring so many cows and

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home,
their stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know
what to do. To refuse the prisoners would have been the
highest affront to the savage gentry that could be offered '
them, and what to do with them they knew not. However
after some debate, they resolved to accept of them : and,
in return, they gave the savages that brought them one
of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of
their bullets ; which, though they did not understand
their use, they seemed particularly pleased with; and then
tying the poor creatures’ hands behind them, they dragged
the prisoners into the boat for our men.
The Englishmen were obliged 'to come away as soon as
they had them, or else they that gave them' this noble
present would certainly have expected that they should
have gone to work with them, have killed two or three of
them the next morning, and, perhaps have invited the
donors to dinner. But having taken their leave, with all
the respect and thanks that could well pass between peo-
ple, where, on either side, they understood not one Word

many of them for their occasion. In their voyage they
endeavored to have some communication with their pris-

for them, but was looked upon as going to murder theme

just felt the knife at their throats; for they immediately
concluded they were unbound on purpose to be killed.

still they expected every day to make a dinner or'a supper
for their new masters. ~
When the three Wanderers had given this unaccountable
history or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard asked
them where their new famil was; and being told that
_they had brought them on s ore, and put them into one
,of their huts, and were come up to beg some victuals for
them, they (the Spaniards) and the other two English-
men, that is to say, the whole colony, resolved to go all
down to the place and see them: and did so, and Friday’s,v
father with them. When they came into the hut, there
they sat, all bound ; for when they had brought them on
shore they bound their hands that they might not take
the boat and make their escape; there, I say, they sat, all
of them stark naked. First, there were three comely fel_

both in shape and features, only tawny ; and two of them,
had they been perfectly white, would have passed for very
handsome women, even in London, having pleasant coun-
tenances, and of a very modest behavior ; especially when
they came afterward to be clothed and dressed, though
that dress was very indifferent, it must be confessed.
The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to
our Spaniards, who were, to give them a just character,
men of the most calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good
humor, that ever I met with; and, in particular of the

them, and then if he understood any of their speech. As
soon as the old man came in, he looked‘seriously at them,
but knew none of them; neither could any of them under-
stand a word he said, or a sign he could make, except one
of the women. However, this was enough to answer the
end, which was to satisfy them that the men into whose
hands they were fallen were Christians ; that they abhorred
eating men or women ; and that they might be sure they
would not be killed. As soon as they were assured of
this, they discovered such a joy, and by such awkward
gestures, several ways, as is hard to describe; for it seems
they were of seVeral nations. The woman who was their
interpreter was bid, in the next place, to ask them if they
were willing to be servants, and to work for the men who
hadgbrought them away, to save their lives ; at which they
all fell a-dancing; and presently one fell to taking up this,
and another that, anything that lay next, to carry on their
shoulders, to intimate they were willing to work.
The governor, who found that the having women among
them would presently be attended with some inconvenience,
and might occasion some strife, and perhaps blood, asked
the three men what they intended to do with these women,
. . y,
.,>...
and how they intended to use them, whether as servants
or as wives ? One of the Englishmen answered, very
boldly and readily, that they would use them as both ; to
which the governor said : “ I am not going to restrain you
from it—you are your own masters as to that ; but this I
think is but just, for avoiding disorders and quarrels among
you, and I desire it of you for that reason only—viz., that
you will all engage, that if any of you take any of these
women as a wife, he shall take but one ; and that having
taken one, none else shall touch her; for though we can
not marry any one of you, yet it is but reasonable that,
while you stay here, the woman any of you takes shall be
maintained by the man that takes her, and should be
his wife—I mean," says he, “ while he continues here, and
that none else shall have anything to 'do with“ her." All
this appeared so just, that every one agreed to it without
any difficulty. _
Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they de-
signed to take any of them? But every one of them
answered “ No.” Some of them said they had wives in
Spain, and the others did not like women that were not
Christians ; and all together declared that they would not
touch one of them, which was an instance of such virtue
as I have not met with in all my travels. On the other

that is to say, a temporary wife ; and so they set up a new
form of living; for the Spaniards and Friday's father lived
in my old habitation, which they had enlarged exceedingly
within. The three servants which were taken in the last
battle of the savages lived with them; and these carried on
the main part of the colony, supplied all the rest with food,
and assisted them in anything as they could, or as they
found necessity required.

fellow considered better than any of them, that it was ap-
plication and business they were to expect assistance in,
as much as in anything else ; and she proved the best
wife of all the parcel. ,
When the poor women saw themselves set in av row thus,
and fetched out one by one, the terrors of their condition

were now going to be devoured. Accordingly, when the
English sailor came in and fetched out one of them, the
rest set up a most lamentable cry, and hung about her, '
and took their leave of her with such agonies and affection
as would have grieved the hardest heart in the world; nor
was it possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them that
they were not to be immediately murdered, till they fetched

by one, had chosen them for their wives. When they had
done, and the fright the women were in was a little over,
the men went to work, and the Spaniards came and helped
- them ; and in a few hours they had built them every one
a new hut or tent for their lodging apart ; for those they
had already were crowded with their tools, household stuff,
and provisions. The three wicked ones had pitched furthest
off, and the two honest ones nearer, but both on the north
shore of the island, so that they continued separated
as before ; and thus my island was peopled in three
places, and, as I might say, three towns were begun to be
built.
And here it is very well worth observing that, as it often
happens in the world (what the wise ends of God’s provi-
dence are, in such a dispostition of things, I can not say),
the two honest fellows had the two worst wives ; and the

most willing, quiet, passive, and subjected creatures,
rather like slaves than wives; but my meaning is, they
were not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, or alike
cleanly and neat. Another observation I must make, to
the honor of a diligent application on one hand, and to
the disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle temper on the
other, that when I came to the place and viewed the sev-
-eral improvements, plantings, and management of the
several little colonies, the two men had so far outgone the
three, that there was no comparison. They had, indeed,
both of them as much ground laid out for corn as they
wanted, and the reason was, because, according to my
rule, nature dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more
com than they wanted ; but the difference of the cultiva»
tion, of the planting, of the fences, and, indeed, of every-
ROBINSON cnusou. 33!
The two men had innumerable young trees planted
about their huts, so that, when you came to the place,
nothing was to be seen but a wood; and though they had
twice had their plantation demolished, once by their own
' countrymen, and once by the enemy, as shall be shown in
its place, yet they had restored all again, and everything
was thriving and flourishing about them ; they had grapes
planted in order, and managed like a vineyard, though
they had themselves never seen anything of that kind, and
by their good ordering their vines, their grapes were as
good again as any of the others. They had also found
themselves out a. retreat in the thickest part of the woods,
where, though there was not a natural cave, as I had
found, yet they made one with incessant labor of their
hands, and where, when the mischief which followed hap-
pened, they secured their wives and children so as they
could never be found ; they having, by sticking in-
numerable stakes and poles of the wood which, as I
said, grew so readily, they made the grove impassable,
except in some places, when they climbed up to get over
the outside part, and then went on by ways of their own
leaving. ~
As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, though
they were much civilized by their settlement compared to
what they were before, and were not so quarrelsome, hav-
ing not the same opportunity; yet one of the certain

the slothful, and it was all overgrown with thorns ;” for
when the Spaniards came to view their crop they could
not see it in some places for weeds, the hedge had sev-
eral gaps in it, where the wild goats had got in and
eaten up the corn; perhaps here and there a dead bush
was crammed in, to stop them out for the present, but
it was only shutting the stable-door after the steed was
stolen. Whereas, when they looked on the colony of
the other two, there was the very face of industry and suc-
cess upon all they did ; there was not a weed to be seen
in all their corn, or a gap in any of their hedges; and they,

“That the diligent hand maketh rich ;" for everything
grew and thrived, and they had plenty within and without;
they had more tame cattle than- the others, more uten-
sils and necessaries within doors, and yet more pleasure
and diversion too.
It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and
cleanly within doors; and having learned the English ways
of dressing and cooking from one of the other Englishmen,
who, as I said, was a cook’s mate on board the ship, they
dressed their husbands’ victuals very nicely and well;
whereas the others could not be brought to understand it;
but then the husband, who, as I say, had been cook's
mate, did it himself. But as for the husbands of the three
wives, they loitered about, fetched turtles' eggs, and

they fared accordingly. The diligent lived well and com-
fortably, and the slothful hard and beggarly; and so, I
Believe, generally speaking, it is all over the world.
But I now come to a scene different from all that had
happened before, either to them or to me ; and the origin
of the story was this: Early one morning there came on

which you please, and there is no room to doubt they
came upon the old errand of feeding upon their slaves:
but that part was now so familiar to the Spaniards, and to
our men, too, that they did not concern themselves about
it, as I did : but having been made sensible, by their ex-
perience, that their only business was to lie concealed, and
I’" ...,-
RoamsdN CRUSOE. 333 .
that if they were not seen by any of the savages they
would go off again quietly, when their business was done,
having, as yet, not the least notion of there being any in-
habitants in the island ; I say, having been made sensible
of this, they had nothing to do but to give notice to all
the three plantations to keep within doors, and not show
themselves, only placing a scout in a proper place, to give
notice when the boats went to sea again.
This was, without doubt, very right ; but a disaster
spoiled all these measures, and made it known among the
savages that there were inhabitants there; which was, in
the end, the desolation of almost the whole colony. After
the canoes with the savages were gone off, the Spaniards
peeped abroad again; and some of them had the curiosity
to go to the place where they had been, to see what they
had been doing. Here, to their great surprise, they found
three savages left behind, and lying fast asleep upon the
ground. It was supposed they had either been so gorged
with their inhuman feast, that, like beasts, they were fallen
asleep, and would not stir when the others went, or they
had wandered into the woods, and did not come back in
time to be taken in.
The Spaniards were greatly surprised'at this sight, and
perfectly at a loss what to do. The Spaniard governor,
as it happened, was with them, and his advice was asked,
but he professed he knew not what to do. As for slaves,
they had enough already; and as to killing them, there
were none of them inclined todo that; the Spaniard gov—
ernor told me they could not think of shedding innocent
blood ; for as to them, the poor creatures had done them
no wrong, invaded none of their property, and they
_, thought they had no just quarrel against them to take
away their lives. And here I must, in justice to these
Spaniards, observe,'that let the accounts of Spanish cru-
elty in Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met
with seventeen men of any nation whatsoever, in any for-
eign country, who were so universally modest, temperate.
virtuous, so very good-humored, and so courteous, as
these Spaniards: and as to cruelty, they had nothing of it
in their very nature: no inhumanity, no barbarity, no out-v
rageous passions : and yet all of them men of great cour-
age and spirit. Their temper and calmness had appeared
in their bearing the insufferable usage of the three English-

men; and their justice and humanity appeared now in the
case of the savages as above. After some consultation
they resolved upon this : that they would lie still a while
longer, till, if possible, these three men might be gone.
But then the governor‘recollected that the three savages
had no boat; and if they were left to rove about the island,
they would certainly discover that there were inhabitants
in it; and so they should be undone that way» Upon this,
they went back again, and there lay the fellows fast asleep
still, and so they resolved to awaken them, and take them
_ prisoners ; and they did, so. The poor fellows were
strangely frightened when they were seized upon and
bound; and afraid, like the women, that they should be
murdered and eaten: for it seems those people think'all

told, and it was very happy he had not, how many there

intelligence of them was, that about two months after this,
six canoes of savages, with about seven, eight, or ten men
in a canoe, came rowing along the north side of the island,
where they never used to come before, and landed, about’
' an hour after sunrise, at a convenient place, about a mile
, from the habitation of the two Englishmen, where this
escaped man had been kept. As the chief Spaniard said
had they been all there, the damage would not have ,been
so much, for not a man of them would have escaped ; but .

too much odds. The two men had the happiness to dis-
cover them about a league off, so that it was above an
hour before they landed ; and as they landed a mile from
their huts, it was some time before they could come at
them. Now, having great reason to believe that they were

slaves which were left, and cause two of the three 'iznen
whom they brought with the women (who, it seems,
proved very faithful to them), to lead them, with their
two wives, and whatever they could carry away with them,
to their retired places in the woods, which I have spoken
of above, and there to bind the two fellows hand and foot,
till they heard further. In the next place, seeing the
savages were all come on shore, and that they had bent
their course directly that Way, they opened the fences
where the milch c0ws were kept, and drove them all out ;
leaving their goats to straggle in the woods, whither they
pleased, that the savages might think they were all bred
wild; but the rogue who came with them was too cunning
for that, and gave them an account of it all, for they went
directly to the place. -
When the two poor frightened men had secured their
wives’and goods, they sent the other slave they had of the
three who came with the women, and Who was at their
place by accident, away to the Spaniards with all speed, to
give them the alarm, and desire s eedy help, and, in the
meantime, they took their arms an what ammunition they
had, and' retreated toward the place in the wood where
their wives were sent \; keeping at a distance, yet so that

them, irretrievable, indeed, for some time. They kept
their station for awhile, till they found the savages, like
wild beasts, spread themselves all over the place, rummag-
ing every way, and every place they could think of, in
search of prey; and in particular for the people, of whom
now it plainly appeared they had intelligence.
The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves
not secure where they stood, because it was likely some of
the wild people might come that way, and they might
come too many together, thought it proper to make an-
other retreat about half a mile further; believing, as it
afterward happened, that the further they strolled, the
fewer would be together. Their next halt was at the en-_
trance into a very thick-grown part of the woods, and
where an old trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow and
very large; and in this tree they both took their standing,
resolving to see there what might offer. They had not
sto'od there long before two of the savages appeared run-
ning directly that way, as if they already had noticed
where they stood, and were coming up to attack them;
and a little way further they espied three more coming

loop-hole, as it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he
took a sure aim, without being seen, waiting till they were
within about thirty yards of the tree, so that he could not

While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on,
they plainly saw that one of the three was the runaway
savage that had escaped from them ; and they both knew
him distinctly, and resolved that, if possible, he should not

but was not quite dead ; and the third had a little scratch

the body of the setond; and being dreadfully frightened,
though not so much hurt, sat down upon the ground,
screaming and yelling in a hideous manner.

to the place where their companions lay in a condition
miserable enough. Here the poor ignorant creatures, not
sensible that they were within reach of the same mischief,

may be supposed, inquiring of him how he came to be

This, I say, is rational ; for nothing is more certain than

reasonably believe they would not have stood so uncon-

frightened even to death, though not hurt, fell with the rest;
so that our men, seeing them all fall together, thought they
had killed them all.
The belief that the savages were all killed made our two
men come boldly out from the tree before they had charged
their guns, which wasa wrOng step ; and they were under
some surprise when they came to the place, and found no
less than four of them alive, and of them two very little

made sure of the runaway savage, that had been the cause
of all the mischief, and of another that was hurt in the
knee, and put them out of their pain ; then the man
that Was not hurt at all came and knelt down to them,
with his two hands held up, and made piteous moans
to them, by gestures and signs, for his life, but could
not say one word to them that they could understand.
However, they made signs to him to sit down at the
foot of a} tree hard by; and one of the Englishmen,
with a plece of rope-yarn, which he had by great chance
in his pocket, tied his two hands behind him, and there
they left him; and with what speed they could made
after the other two, which were gone before, fearing

covered place in the woods, where their wives, and the few
goods they had left, lay. They came once in sight of the
two men,but it was at a great distance; however, they had
the satisfaction to see them cross over a valley toward the
sea, quite the contrary way from that which led to their
Rosmson CRUSOE. 339
with that they went back to where they left their pris-
oner, who, as they supposed, was delivered by his com-
rades, for he was gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn
with which they had bound him lay just at the foot of
the tree. '
They were now in as great concern as before, not
knowing what course to take, or' how near the enemy
might be, or in what number; so they resolved to go
away to the place where their wives were, to see if all
was well there, and to make them easy. These were in
fright enough, to be sure ; for though the savages were
their own countrymen,yet they were most terribly afraid
of them, and perhaps the more for the knowledge they
‘ had of them. When they came there,_ they found the
savages had been in the wood, and very near that place,
but had not found it ; for it was indeed inaccessible, from
the trees standing so thick, unless the persons seeking it
had been directed by those that knew it, which these did
not ; they found, therefore, everything very safe, only the
women in a terrible fright. .While they were here they
had the comfort to have seven of the Spaniards come
to their assistance; the other ten, with their servants,
and Friday’s father, were gone in a body to defend
their bower, and the corn and cattle that were kept
there, in case the savages should have roved over to
that side of the country; but they did not spread so
far. With the seven Spaniards came one of the three
savages, who, as I said, were their prisoners formerly;
and with them also came the savage whom the English-
men had left bound hand and foot at the tree; for it seems
they came that way, saw the slaughter of the seven men,
and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with them;
where, however, they were obliged to bind him again, as
they had the two others who were left when the third ran

The prisoners now began to be a burden to them ; and
they were so afraid of their escaping that they were once
resolving to kill them all, believing they were under an
absolute necessity to do so for their own preservation.
However, the chief of the Spaniards would not consent to
it, but ordered, for the present, that they should be sent
out of the way to my old cave in the valley, and be kept
there, with two Spaniards to guard them, and have food
for their subsistence, which was done; and they were bound .
there hand and foot for that night.
When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were
so encouraged, that they could not satisfy themselves to

tion, to go forward toward their ruined plantation ; but, a
little before they came thither, coming in sight of the sea-
shore, they saw plainly the savages all embarked again in
their canoes, in order to be gone. They seemed sorry at

a parting blow ; but, upon the whole, they were very well '
34° ROBINSON CRUSOE-
The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all
their improvements destroyed, therest all agreed to come
and help them to rebuild, and assist them with needful sup-
, plies. Their three countrymen, who were not yet noted for
having the least inclination to do any good, yet as soon as
they heard of it (for they, living remote eastward, knew
nothing of the matter till all was over), came and offered
their help and assistance, and did, very friendly, work for
several days to restore their habitation and make neCessav
ries for them. And thus in a little time they were set upon
their legs again.
About two days after this they had the further satisfac-
tion of seeing three of the savages’ canoes come driving
on shore, and, at some distance from them, two drowned
men, by which they had reason to believe that they had
met with a storm at sea, which had overset some of them, .
for it had blown very hard the night after they went off.
However, as some might miscarry, so, on the other hand,
enough of them escaped to inform the rest, as well of what
they had done as of what had happened to them ; and to
whet them on to another enterprise of the same nature,

next morning early they posted themselves, with all their

The chief Spaniard, whom I described so often, com-

commanded under him. The savages came forward like
lions; and our men, which was the worst of their fate, had
no advantage in their situation; only that Will Atkins,

many they killed or wounded they knew not, but the con-

ages; they were frightened to the last degree to hear such
a dreadful noise, and see their men killed, and others
hurt, but see nobody that did it ; when, in the middle of

the rest of the body been at hand, to have poured in their
shot continually, the savages had been effectually routed ;
for the terror that was among them came principally from
this, that they were killed by the gods with thunder and
lightning, and could see nobody that hurt them. But Will
Atkins, staying to load again, discovered the cheat ; some
of the savages who were at a distance spying them, came
a 7- "ioBrNsoN cnusoa. 343

retiring as fas --/as they could, yet they wounded Atkins
himself, and illed one of his fellow-Englishmen with
their arrows, as they did afterward one Spaniard, and one
of the Indian slaves who came with the women. This
slave'was a most gallant fellow, and fought most desper-

was good: but Will Atkins replied merrily, “ That is true,

go on while I am warm.” “ Well, Senor Atkins,” says
the Spaniard, “ you have behaved gallantly, and done your

But as it was a clear, moonlit night, and they found the
savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded

lay, they afterward resolved to fall upon them in the night,

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedi-

as the halberts and staves. They would have had the
women kept back, but they said they were resolved to die
with their husbands: Having thus formed their little
army, they marched out from among the trees, and came
up to the teeth of the enemy, shouting and hallooing as
loud as they could ; the savages stood all together, but
were in the utmost confusion, hearing the noise of our
men shouting from three quarters together. They would
have fought if they had seen us ; for as soon as we
came near enough to be seen, some arrows were shot,
and poor old Friday was wounded, though not danger-

and eighty of them; the rest, being frightened out of
their wits, scoured through the woods and over the hills,
with all the speed that fear and nimble feet could help
them to ; and as we did not trouble ourselves much to
pursue them, they got all together to the sea-side, where
they landed, and where their canoes lay. But their dis-
aster was not at an end yet; for it blew a terrible storm of
wind that evening from the sea, so that it was impossible
for them to go off ; nay, the storm continuing all night,
when the tide came up their canoes were most of them

sions, yet they were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt
them up and down ; for as they were too nimble of foot
for our people when they found them single, so our men
durst not go abroad single, for fear of being surround-
ed with their numbers. The bcst was they had no weap-
ons; for though they had bows, they had no arrows left,
nor any materials to make any ; nor had they any edge-
tools among them. The extremity and distress they were
reduced to was great, and indeed deplorable ; but, at the
same time, our men were also brought to very bad circum-
stances by them, for though their retreats were preserved,
yet their provision was destroyed, and their harvest spoiled
and what to do, or which way to turn themselves, they
knew not. The only refuge they had now was the stock
of cattle they had in the valley by the cave, and some little
corn which grew there, and the plantation of the three
Englishmen. Will Atkins and his comrades were now re-
' duced to two; one of them being killed by an arrow, which
struck him on the side of his head. just under the temple,
so that he never spoke more ; and it was very remarkable
that this was the same barbarous fellow that cut the poor

at last tame them, and bring them to anything, they would

upon their daily labor. In order to do this,’they so fol-

did not hit him, yet he would fall down for fear. So
dreadfully frightened were they that they kept out of
sight further and further; till, at last, our men followed
them, and almost every day killing or wounding some of
them, they kept up in the woods or hollow places so much,
that it reduced them to the utmost misery for want of
food ; and many were afterward found dead in the woods,
without any hurt, absolutely starved to death.
When "our men found this, it made their hearts relent,
and pity moved them, especially the generous-minded
Spaniard governor; and he proposed, if possible, to take
one of them alive, and bring him to understand what they
.meant, so far as to be able to act as interpreter, and go
among them and see if they might be brought to some
conditions that might be depended upon, to save their
lives and do us no harm. ’

kindly fused, and victuals given him, and no violence
offered him, he at last grew tractable, and came to him-
self. They often brought old Friday to talk to him, who
always told him how kind the others would be to them all;
that they would not only save their lives, but give them
part of the island to live in, provided they would give sat-
isfaction that they would keep in their own bounds, and
not come beyond it to injure or prejudice others; and that
they should have corn given them to plant and make it
grow for their'bread, and some bread given them for their
present subsistence;and old Friday bade the fellow go
lalk with the rest of his countrymen, and see what they
laid to it; assuring them that, if they did not agree imme-
diately, they should be all destroyed.

them ; upon which twelve‘Spaniards and two Englishmen,
well armed, with three Indian slaves and old Friday,
marched to the place where they were. The three Indian
slaves carried them a large quantity of bread, some rice
boiled up to cakes and dried in the sun, and three live
goats; and they were ordered to go to the side of a hill,
where they sat down, eat their provisions very thankfully,
and were the most faithful fellows to their words that
could be thought of; for, except when they came to beg“
victuals and directions, they never came out of their
bounds; and there they lived when I came to the island,
and I went to see them. They had taught them both to

surrounded with high rocks behind them, and lying plain
toward the sea before them, on the south-east corner of
theisland. They had land enough, and it was very good
and fruitful ; about a mile and a half broad, and three or
four miles in length. Our men taught them to make
wooden spades, such as I made for myself, and gave
among them twelve hatchets and three or four knives;
and there they lived, the most subjected, innocent creati-
ures that ever were heard of. '
After this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquility with
respect to the savages, till I came to revisit them, which
was about two years after; not but that, now and then,
some canoes of savages came on shore for their triumphal,
unnatural feasts ; but as they were of several nations, and
perhaps had never heard of those that came before, or
the reason of it, they did not make any search or inquiry
after their countrymen; and if they had, it would have
been very hard to have found them out.
Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all that
happened to them till my return. at least that was worth
notice. The Indians were wonderfully civilized by them,
and they frequently went among them; but they forbid,
on pain of death, any one of the Indians coming to them,
because they would not have their settlement betrayed
again. One thing was very remarkable—viz., that they
taught the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets, but
they soon outdid their masters: for they made abundance
of ingenious things in wicker-work, particularly baskets.
sieves, bird-cages, cupboards, etc.; as also chairs, stools,
beds, couches, being very ingenious at such work when
they were once put in the way of it. '
My coming was a particular relief to these people, be-
cause we furnished them with knives, scissors, spades,
shovels, pick-axes, and all things of that kind which they
could want. With the help of these tools they were so~
very handy that they came at last to build up their huts
or houses very handsomely, raddling or working it up
like basket-work all the way round. This piece of in-
genuity, although it looked very odd, was an exceed-
ing good fence, as well against heat as against all sorts
of Vermin; and our men were so taken with it that
they got the Indians to come and do the like for them;
so that when I came to ee the two Englishmen’s colo-
nies, they looked at a dist nce as if they all lived like bees
in a hive. O ‘
As for Will Atkins, who was now become a very indus-
trious, useful, and sober fellow, he had made himself such
a tent of basket work as I believe was never seen ; it was
one hundred and twenty paces round on the outside, as I
measured by my steps; the walls were as close worked
as a- basket, in panels or squares of thirty-two in num-
ber, and very strong, standing about seven feet high; in
the middle was another not above twenty-two paces
round, but built stronger, being octagon in its form,
and in the eight corners stood eight very strong posts;
round the top of which he laid strong pieces, knit to-
gether with wooden pins, from which he raised a pyra-
mid for a handsome roof of eight rafters, joined to-
gether very well, though he had no nails, and only a few
spikes, which he made himself, too, out of the old iron
that I had left there) Indeed, this fellow showed abund-
ance of ingenuity in several things which he had no knowl-
edge of : he made him a forge, with a pair of wooden bel-

work; and he formed out of the iron crows a middling
good anvil to hammer upon: in this manner he made
many things, but especially hooks, staples, and spikes,
bolts and hinges. But to return to the house: after he
had pitched the roof of his innermost tent, he worked it

thatched that over again so ingeniously with rice-straw, and
over that a large leaf of a tree, which covered the top, that
his house was as dry as if it had been tiled or slated. He
owned, indeed, that the savages had made the basket-work
for him. The outercircuit was covered as a lean-to all round
this inner appartment, and long rafters lay from the thirty-
two angles to the top posts of the inner house, being about
twenty feet distant, so that there was a space like a. walk
within the outer wicker‘wall, and without the inner, near
twenty-feet wide. '
The inner place be partitioned off with the same wicker-
work, but much fairer, and divided into six apartments,

into the main tent, another door into the main tent,
and another door into the space or walk that was
round it; so that the walk was also divided into six
equal parts, which served not only for a retreat, but to
store up an necessaries which the family had occasion
for. These six spaces not taking up the whole circum-
ference, what other apartments the out circle had were
thus ordered: As soon as you were in at the door of
the outer circle you had a short passage straight before
you to the door of the inner house; but on either side
was a wicker partition and a door in it, by which you

wide and about thirty feet long, and through that into
another not quite so long; so that in the outer circle
were ten handsome rooms, six of which were only to be
come at through the appartments of the inner tent, and
served as closets or retiring rooms to the respective cham-
bers of the inner circle; and four large warehouses, or barns,
or what you please to call them, which went through one
another,two on either hand of the passage, that led through
the outer door to the inner tent, Such a piece of basket-
work, I believe, was never seen in the world, nor a house
or tent so neatly contrived, much less so built. In this
great bee-hive lived the three families, that is to say, Will
Atkins and his companion ; the third was killed, but his
wife remained with three children, and the other two were
not at all backward to give the widow her full share of
everything, I mean as to their corn, milk, grapes, etc.,ar1d
when they killed a kid, or found a turtle on the shore; so
that they all lived well enough ; though it was true they
were not so industrious as the other two, as has been
observed already.
One thing, however, can not be omitted—viz., that as
for religion, I do not know that there was anything of
that kind among them ;- they often, indeed, put one an-
other in mind that there was a God, by the very common
method of seamen, swearing by His name : nor Were their
poor ignorant savage wives much better “for having been
married to Christians, as we must call them; for they knew
very little of God themselves so they were utterly incapa-
ble of entering into any discourse with their wives about
God, or to talk anything to them concerning religion.
The utmost of all the improvement which I can say the
wives had made from them was, that they had taught
them to speak English pretty well ; and most of their
children, who were near twenty in all, were taught to

ladies over ; they had all children, more or less ; the
mothers were all a good sort of well-governed, quiet, labori-
ous women, modest and decent, helpful to one another,
~mighty observant, and subject to their masters (I can not
call them husbands), and lacked nothing but to be well in~
structed in the Christian religion, and to be legally mar-
ried ; both of which were happily brought about afterward
by my means, or at least in consequence of my coming
among them.

HAVING thus given an account of the colony in general,
and pretty much of my runagate Englishmen, I must say
something of the Spaniards, who were the main body of
the family, and in whose story there are some incidents
also remarkable enough. ~ '
I had a great many discourses with them about their
circumstances when they were among the savages. They
told me readily that they had no instances to give of their
application or ingenuity in that country ; that they were a
poor, miserable, dejected handful ofpeopie ; that even if
means had been put into their hands, yet they had so
abandoned themselves to despair, and were so sunk under
the weight of their misfortune, that they thought of noth-
ing but starving. One of them, a grave and sensible man,
told me he was convinced they were in the wrong ; that it
was not the part of wise men to give themselves up to their
misery, but always to take hold of the helps which reason
offered, as well for present support as for future deliver-
ance : he told me that grief was the most senseless, insig-

things past, which were generally impossible to be recalled
or to be remedied, but had no views of things to come, and
had no share in anything that looked like deliverance, but
354 ROBINSON cansott.
upon this he repeated a Spanish proverb, which, though I
can not repeat in the same words that he spoke it in, yet I
remember I made it into an English proverb of my own
thus : a
"In trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your nouble doubled.”
He then ran on in remarks upon all the little improve~
ments I had made in my solitude : my unwearied applica-
tion, as'he called it; and how I had made a condition,

theirs,la thousand times more happy than theirs was, even
now when they were all together. He told me it was re-
' markable that Englishmen had a greater presence of mind
in their distress than any people that ever he met with;
that their unhappy nation and the Portuguese were the
worst men in the world to struggle with misfortunes ; for

were over, was to despair, lie down under it, and die, with-
out rousing their thoughts up to the proper remedies for
escape.
I told him their case and mine differed exceedingly; that
they were cast upon the shore without necessaries, without
supply of food, or present sustenance till they could pro-
wide for it ', that, it was true, I had this further disadvan-


tage and discomfort, that I was alone ; but then the sup-
plies I had providentially thrown into my hands, by the
unexpected driving of the ship on shore, was such a help
as would have encouraged any creature in the world to
have applied himself as I have done. “ Senor,” says the
Spaniard, “had we poor Spaniards been in your case, we
should never have got half those things out of the ship, as
you did : nay," says he, “we should never- have found
means to have got a raft to carry them, or to have got the
raft on shore without boat or sail; and how much less
should we have done if any of us had been alone !” Well,
I desired him to abate his compliments, and go on with
the history of their coming-0n shore, where they landed.
He told me they unhappily landed at a place where there
were people without provisions; whereas, had they had the
common sense to put off to sea again, and gone to another
island a little further, they had found provisions, though
without people: there being an island that way, as they
had been told, where there were provisions, though no
people—that is to say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had

and hogs at several times, where they had bred in such
multitudes, and where turtle and sea-fowlsvwere in such

though they had found no bread; whereas, here they were
only sustained with a few roots and herbs, which they
understood not, and which had no substance in them, and
which the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough; and
they could treat them no better, unless they would turn ‘

They gave me an, account how many ways they strove
to civilize the savages they were with, and to teach them
rational customs in the ordinary way of living, but in vain;
and how they retorted upon them as unjust that they win
came there for assistance and support should attempt to
set up for instructors to those that gave them food ; inti-
mating, it seems, that none should set up for the instruct-
ors of others but those who could live without them.
They gave me dismal acetiunts of the extremities they
were driven to; how sometimes they were many days with-
out any food at all, the island they were upon being inhab-
ited by a sort of savages that lived more indolent, and for
that reason were loss supplied with the necessaries of life,
than they had reason to believe others were in the same
part of the world : and yet they found that these savages
were less ravenous and voracious than those who had bet-
ter supplies of food. Also, they added, they could not
but see with what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness
the governing providence of God directs the events of
things in this world, which, they said, appeared in their
circumstances: for if, pressed by the hardships they were
under, and the barrenness of the country where they were
they had searched after a better to live in, they had then
been out of the way of the relief that happened to them
by my means.
They then gave me an account how the savages whom
they lived amongst expected them to go out with them

with them, had they not had the disaster to lose their
ammunition, they could have been serviceable not only to
their friends, but have made themselves terrible both to
friends and enemies ; but being without powder and shot,

condition than the savages themselves, for they had neither
. bow nor arrows, nor could they use those the savages gave
‘ them. So they could do nothing but stand still-and be
wounded with their arrows, till they came up to the teeth
of their enemy ; and then, indeed, the three halberts they
had were of use to them; and they would oftendrive a
whole little army before them with those halberts, and
sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their muskets.
But, for all this, they were sometimes surrounded with
multitudes, and in great danger from their arrows, till at
last they found the way to make themselves large targets
of wood, which the covered with skins of wild beasts,

they thought he had keen killed; but when they afterward
heard he was taken prisoner, they were under the
greatest grief imaginable and would willingly have

They told me that when they were so knocked down,
the rest of their company rescued them, and stood over

made their way with their halberts and pieces, standing
close together in a line, through a body of above a thous-
and savages, beating down all that came in their way, got
the victory over their enemies, but to their great sorrow,
because it was with the loss of their friend, whom the
ROBINSON causos. 357
I gave an account before. They described, most affec-
tionately, how they were surprised with joy at the return
of their friend and companion in misery, who they thought
had been devoured by the wild beasts of the worst kind—
wild men; and yet, how more and more they were surprised
,with the account he gave them of his errand, and that _
there was a Christian in any place near, much more one
that was able,rand had humanity enough, to contribute to
their deliverance. _ '
They described how they were astonished at the sight
of the relief I sent them, and at the appearance of loaves
of bread—things they had not seen since their coming to
that miserable place; how often they crossed it and blessed
it as bread sent from heaven; and what a reviving cordial
it was to their spirits to taste it, as also the other things I
had sent for their supply ; and, after all, they would have
‘told me something of the joy they were in at the sight of
a boat and pilots, to carry them away to the person and
place from whence all these new comforts came. But it
was impossible to express it by words, for their excessive ,
joy naturally driving them to unbecoming extravagances,
they had no way to describe them but by telling me they
bordered upon lunacy, having no way to give vent to their
passions suitable to the sense that was upon them; that in
some it worked one way and in some another; and that
some of them, through a surprise of joy, would burst into
tears, others be stark mad, and others immediately faint.
This discourse extremely affected me, and called to my
,mind Friday’s ecstasy when he met his father, and the
poor people's ecstasy when I took them up at sea after
ROBINSON causos. 357
when he found himself delivered in the place where he
expected to perish ; and my own joy, when, after twenty-
eight years’ captivity, I found a good ship ready to carry
me to my own country. All these things made me more
sensible of the relation of these poor men, and more
affected with it.
Having thus given a view of the state of things as I
found them, I must relate the heads Of what I did for
these people, and the condition in which I left them. It
was their opinion, and mine too, that they Would be
troubled no more with the savages, or if they were, they
would be able to cut them off, if they were twice as man
as before ; so they had no concern about that. ThenI
entered into a serious discourse with the Spaniard, whom
I call governor, about their stay in the island: for as I was
not come to carry any of them off, so it would not be just
to carry off somc and leave others, who, perha s, would
be unwilling to stay if their strength was diminished. On
the other hand, I told them I came to establish them
there, not to remove them; and then I let them know that
I had brought with me relief of sundry kinds for them;
that I had been at a great charge to supply them with all
things necessary, as well for their convenience as their de-
fense;and thatI had such and such particular persons
with me, as well to increase and recruit their number, as
by the particular necessary employments which they were

in which at present they were in want.
They were all together when I talked thus to them; and
before I delivered to them the stores I had brought, I
asked them one by one, if they had entirely forgotten

them, and was so far from designing anything against the
Spaniards, that he owned they had done nothing to him
but what his own mad humor made necessary, and what
he would have done, and perhaps worse. in their case; and


that he would ask their pardon, if I desired it, for the foolish
and brutish things he had done to them, and was very will-
ing and desirous of living in terms of entire friendship
and union with them, and would do an thing that lay in
his power to convince them of it ; and] as for going to
England, he cared not if he did not go thither these twenty

giving me this assurance, that they would never have any
interest separate from one another.
Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship,
we appointed the next day to dine all together ; and, in-
deed, we made a splendid feast. I caused the ship’s
cook and his mate to come on shore and dress our dinner,
and the old cook’s mate we had on shore assisted. We
'brought on shore six pieces of good beef and four piecéS
,of pork, out of the ship’s provisions, with our punch-bowl,

to make every one of them four shirts, and, at the Span-
iard’s request, afterward made them up six ; these were
exceedingly comfortable to them, having been what they
had long since forgot the use of, or what it was to wear
them. I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I men-
tioned before, to make every one a light coat, likea frock,

for pumps, shoes, stockings, hats, etc. I can not express
what pleasure sat upon the countenances of all these
poor men when they saw the care I had taken of them, and
how well I had furnished them. They told me I was a
father to them ; and that having such acorrespondent as I
was in so remote a part of the world, it would make them
forget that they were left in a desolate place ; and they all
voluntarily engaged to me not to leave the place without
my consent. -
Then I presented to them the people I had brought
with me, particularly the tailor, the smith and the two car-
penters, all of them most necessary people, but, above all,

did; and, what was still more, he taught the women not
only how to sew and stitch, and use the ,needle, but made
them assist to make the shirts for their husbands, and for
all the rest. As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention
how useful they were; for they took to pieces all my
clumsy, imhancly things, and made clever, convenient
tables, s'tools, bedsteads, Cupboard, lockers, shelves, and
everything they wanted of that kind. But to let them see
36o ROBINSON CRUSOE.
to see Will Atkins’s basket-house, as I called it ; and they
both owned they never saw an instance of such natural in-
genuity before, nor anything so regular and so handily


built, at least of its kind : and one of them, when he saw
it, after musing a good while, turned about to me, “ I am
sure," says he, “that man has no need of us ; you need do
nothing but give him tools.
Then I brought them out all my store of tools. and gave
every man a digging-spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we
had no barrows or plows ; and to every separate place a
pick-ax, a crow, a broad-ax, and a saw ; always appointing,
that as often as any were broken or worn out,they should
be supplied without grudging out of the general stores
that I left behind. Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels,
knives, scissors. and all sorts of iron-work, they had with—
out reserve, as they required; for no man would take more
than he wanted, and he must be a fool that, would
waste or spoil them on any account whatever; and fon
the use of the smith I left two tons of unwrought iron forI
a supply.
My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them
was such, even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice
at them ; for now they could march as I used to do, with a
musket upon each shoulder, if there was occasion ; and

little advantages of situation, which also they could not
miss, if they had occasion.
I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother
was starved to death, and the maid also ; she was a sober,
well-educated, religious young woman, and behaved so in-
offensively that every one gave her a good word; she had,
indeed, an unhappy life with us, there being no woman in
the ship but herself, but she bore it with patience. After

of thriving upon my island, and considering that they had
neither business nor acquaintance in the East Indies, or
reason for taking so long a voyage, both of them came to
\ me and desired I would give them leave to remain on the
island, and be entered among my family, as they called it.
I agreed to this readily; and they had a little plot of
ground allotted to them, where they had three tents or
houses set up, surrounded with a basket-work, palisadoed
like Atkins’s, adjoining to his plantation. Their tents were
contrived so that they had each of them a room apart to
lodge in, and a middle tent like a great store-house to lay
their goods in, and to eat and drink in. And now the
other two Englishmen removed their habitation to the
same place ; and so the island was divided into three col-'
onies, and no more—viz., the Spaniards, with old Friday
3627" ROBINSON CRUSOE.
which was, in a word, the capital city, and where they had
so enlarged and extended their works, as well under as on
the outside of the bill, that they lived, thorigh perfectly
concealed, yet full at large. Never was there such a little
city in a wood, and so hid, in any part of the world ; for I
verily believe that a thousand men might have ranged the ’
island a month, and, if they had not known there was such
a thing, and looked on purpose for it, they would not have
found it. Indeed, the trees stood so thick and so close,
and grew so fast woven one into another, that nothing

cept the only two narrow entrances where they went in'
and out could be found, which was not very easy; one
' of them was close down at the water’s edge, on the side
of the creek, and it was afterward above two hundred
yards to the place; and the other was up a ladder, as
I have already described it; and they had also a large
wood, thickly planted, on the top of the hill containing
above an acre, which grew apace, and concealed the
place from all discovery there, with only one narrow place
between two trees, not easily to be discovered, to enter on
that side.
The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where there
were four families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left
there, with their wives and children ; three savages that
were slaves, the widow and the children of the English-
man that was killed, the young man and the maid, and,by
the way, we made a wife of her before we went away.
There were besides the two carpenters and the tailor,
whom I brought with me for them ; also the smith, who
was a very necessary man to them, especially as a gun-
smith, to take care of their arms; and my other man,
'whom I called Jack-of-all-trades, who was. in himself
as good almost as twenty men ; for he was not only
a very ingenious fellow, but a very merry fellow, and
before I went away we married him to the honest
Lnafid that came with the youth in the ship I mentiOned
e ore.
And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to

extensive in his charity, and exemplary in almost every-
thing he did. What then can any one say against being
very sensible of the value of such a man, notwithstanding

under God (and at that he crossed his breast) saved my
life, but you have admitted me’to go this voyage in your
ship, and by your obliging civility have taken me into
your family, giving me an opportunity of free conversa-
tion. Now, sir, you see by my habit What my profession
is, and I guess by your nation phat yours is ; I may think
it is my duty, and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost en-
deavors, on all occasions, to bring all the souls I can to
the knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the Catholic
doctrine ; but as I am here under‘ your permission, and
in your family, I am bound, in justice to your kindness as
well as in decency and good manners, to be under your

leave, enter into any debate on the points of religion
in which we may not agree, further than you shall give '
me leave.”

without any dislike on either side, it should be his fault,
not ours.
He replied that he thought all our conversations might
be easily separated from disputes ; that it was not his
business to cap principles with every man he conversed
with; and that be rather desired me to converse with him
as a gentleman than as a religionist ; and that, if I would
give him leave at any time to discourse upon religious
subjects, he would readily comply with it, and that he did
not doubt but I would allow him also to defend his own
opinions as well as he could ; but that without my leave
he would not break in upon me with any such thing. He
told me further, that he would not cease to do all that be-

of all that was in her ; and though, perhaps, we would not
join with him, and he could not pray with us, he hoped
he might pray for us, which 'he would .do upon all occa-
sions. In this manner we conversed; and as he Was of the
most obliging, gentleman-like behaviour, so he was, if,I
may be allowed to say so, a man of good sense, and, as I
believe, 0t great learning. ‘
He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of
the many extraordinary events of it ; of many adventures
which had befallen him in the few years that he had been
abroad in the world; and particularly, it was very remark~
able, that in the voyage he was now engaged in he had the

resolved not to go to the Madeiras, but to load salt at the

no remedy in this exigence but to go with the ship, and

further of him. .
But I shall not make digression into other men's stories
which have no relation to my own; so I return to what
concerns our affairs in the island. He came to me one
morning (for he lodged among us all the while we were
upon the island), and it happened to be just when was
going to_visit the Englishmen’s colony, at the furthest
part of the island; I say, he came to me, and told me,
with a very grave countenance, that he had for two or
three days desired an opportunity of some discourse with
me, which he hoped would not be displeasing to me, be-
cause he thought it might in some measure correspond
with my general design, which was the prosperity of my
new colony, and perhaps might put it, at least more than
be yet thought it was, in the way of God's blessing;
I looked a little surprised at the last part of his dis-
course, and turning a little short, “ How, sir,” said I,
“ can it be said that we are not in the way of God's bless-
ing, after such visible assistances and deliverances as we
have seen here, and of which I have given you a large
account?” “ If you had pleased, sir,” said he, with a world
of-modesty, and yet great readiness, “to have heard me,
you would have found no room to have been displeased,
much less to think so hard- of me, that I should suggest
that you have not had wonderful assistances and deliver-
ances; and I hope, on your behalf, that you are in the way
of God’s blessing, and your design is exceeding good, and


will prosper. But, sir, though it were more so than is
even possible to you, yet there may be some among you
that are not equally right in their actions : and you know
that in the story of the children of Israel, one Achan in
the camp removed God’s blessing from them, and turned
His hand so against them, that six-and-thirty of them,
though not concerned in the crime, were the objects of
divine vengeance, and bore the weight of that punish-
ment.”
I was sensibly touched with this discourse, and told him
his inference was so just, and the whole design seemed so
sincere, and was really so religious in its own nature, that
I was very sorry I had interrupted him, and begged him to
go on; and, in the meantime, because it seemed that what
we had both to say might take up some time, I told him I
was going to the Englishmen’s plantations, and asked him
to go with me, and we might discourse of it by the way.
He told me he would the more willingly wait on me
thither, because there partly the thing was acted which he
desired to speak to me about; so we walked on, and I
pressed him to be free and plain with me in what he had
to sa .
“ \ilrfhy, then, sir," said he, “be pleased to give me leave
to lay down a few propositions, as the foundation of what
I have to say, that we may not differ in the general princi-
ples, though We may be of some differing opinions in the
practice of particulars. First, sir, though we differ in some
of the doctrinal articles of religion (and it is very un-
happy it is so, especially in the case before us, as I shall
show afterward), yet there are some general principles in
which we both agree—~that there is a God ; and that this
God having given us some stated general rules for our
service and obedience, we ought not willingly and know
ingly to offend Him, either by neglecting to do what He '
has commanded, or by doing what He has expressly for-
bidden. And let our different religions be what they will,
this general principle is readily owned by us all, that the
blessing of God does not ordinarily follow presumptuous
sinning against His command ; and every good Christian
,will be affectionately concerned to prevent any that are
under his care living in a total neglect of God and His
commands. It is not your men being Protestants, what~
ever my opinion may be of such, that discharges me from


being concerned for their souls, and from endeavoring, if
it lies before me, that they should live in as little distance
from enmity with their Maker as possible, especially if
you give me leave to meddle so far in your circuit.”
I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told him
I granted all he had said, and thanked him that he would
so far concern himself for us : and begged he would ex-
plain the particulars of what he had observed, that like
~ joshua, to 'take his own parable, I might put away the
accursed thing from us.
“Why, then, sir," says he, “I will take the liberty you
give me ; and there are three things, which, if I am right,
must stand in the way of God's blessing upon your en-
deavors here, and which I should rejoice, for your sake
and their own, to see removed. And, sir, I promise my-
self that you will fully agree with me in them all, as soon
as I name them ; especially because I shall convince you
that every one of them may, with great ease, and very
much to your satisfaction, be remedied. First, sir," says
be, “you have here four Englishmen, who' have fetched
women from among the savages, and have taken them as
their wives, and have had many children by them all, and
yet are not married to them after any stated legal manner,
as the laws of God and man require. To this, sir, I know,
you will object that there were nolclergyman or priest of
any kind to perform the ceremony ;. nor any pen and ink,
or paper, to write down a contract of marriage, and have
it signed between them. And I know also, sir, what the
Spaniard governor has told you, I mean of the agreement
that he obliged them to make when they took those
women—viz.,that they should choose them out by con-
sent, and keep separately to them ; which by the way, is
nothing of a marriage, no agreement with the women as
wives but only an agreement among themselves, to keep
them from quarreling. But sir, the essence of the sacra-
ment of matrimony (so he called it, being a Roman) con-
sists not only in the mutual consent of the parties to take
one another as man and wife, but in the formal and' legal
obligation that there is in the contract to compel the man
woman, at all times, to own and acknowledge each other ;
obliging the man to abstain from all other women, to en-
gage in no other contract while these subsist ; and on all
occasions, as ability allows, to provide honestly for them
"i “v

and their children ; and to oblige the women to the same
or like conditions, on their side. Now, sir," says be,
these men may, when they please, ’or when occasion pre-
sents, abandon these women, disown their children, leave
them to perish, and take other women, and marry them
while these are living;” and here he added, with some
warmth, _“ How, sir, is God honored in this unlawful lib-
erty? And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavors
in this place, however good in themselves, and however
' sincere in your design, while these men, who at present
are your subjects, under your absolute gOvernment and
dominion, are allowed by you to live in open adultery?"
I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but much
more with the convincing arguments he supported it with;
but I thought to have got off my young priest by telling
him that all that part was done when I was not there; and
that they had lived so many years with them now, that if
it was adultery, it was past remedy ; nothing could be
done in it now.
“Sir,” says he, “asking your pardon for such freedom
you are right in this, that, it being done in your absence,
you could not be charged with that part of the crime; but,
"i “v
fore, under an obligation to do your utmost now to put an
end to it. You should legally and effectually marry them;
and as, sir, my way of marrying may not be easy to recon-
cile them to, though it will be effectual, even by your own
laws, so your way may be as well before God, and as valid
among men. I mean by written contract, signed by both
man and woman. and by all the witnesses present, which
all the laws of Europe would decree to be valid."
I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much
sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in his dis-
course as to his own party or church, and such true warmth
for preserving people that he had no knowledge of or re-
lation to from transgressing the laws of God. But recol-
lecting what he had said of marrying them by a written
contract, which I knew he would stand to, I returned it
back upon him, and told him I granted all that he had
said to be just, and on his part very kind ; that I would '
discourse with the men upon the point now, when I
came to them; and I knew no reason why they should
scruple to let him marry them all, which I knew wok
enough would be granted to be as authentic and Valid
in England as if they were married by one of their own
clergymen. *
I then pressed him to tell me what was the second com.
plaint which he had to make, acknowledging that I was
- ROBINSON cnuson. 369
ly for it. He told me he would use the same freedom and
plainness in the second,and hoped I would take it as well;
and this was, that, notwithstanding these English subjects
of mine, as he called them, had lived with these women
almost seven years, had taught them to speak English,
and even to read it, and that they were, as he perceived,
women of tolerable understanding, and capable of ins-
truction, yet they had not, to this hour, taught them any-
thing of the Christian religion-no, not so much as to
know there was a God, or a worship, or in what manner
God was to be served, or that their own idolatry, and wor-
shiping they knew not whom, was false and absurd. This,
he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and what God would
certainly call them to adcount for, and perhaps at last take
the work out of their hands. He spoke this very affection-
ately and warmly. _
“ I am persuaded,” says he, “ had these men lived in
the savage country whence their wives came, the savages
would have taken more pains to have brought them to be
idolators, and to worship the devil, than any of these men,
so far as I can see, have taken with them to teach the
knowledge of the true God. Now, sir," said he, “ though
I do not acknowledge your religion, or you mine, yet we
would be glad to see the devil's servants and the subjects
of his kingdom taught to know the general principles of
the Christian religion ; that they might, at least, hear of
God and a Redeemer, and of ‘the resurrection, and of a
future state-things which we all believe ; that they might,
at least, be so much nearer coming into the bosom of the
true church than they are now in the public profession of
idolatry and devil-worship.” '
I could hold no longer: I took him in my arms, and
embraced him eagerly. “ How far,” said I to him, “ have
I been from understanding the most essential part of a
Christian—viz., to love the interest of the Christian
church, and the good of other men’s souls! I scarce
have known what belongs to the being a Christian."




.
“ Oh, sir! do not say so,” replied he; “ this thing is not“
your fault." “ No,” said I; but why did I never lay it
to heart as well as you ? ” “It is not too late yet,” said
he ; “ be not too forward to condemn yourself.” ‘But
what can be done now?’ said I; you see I am going
ing away.” “Will you give me leave to talk with these
poor men about it ! ” “ Yes, with all my heart," said
I,” “and will oblige them to give heed to what you say
too." “ As to that,” said he, “ we must leave them to the
, mercy of Christ; but it is your business to assist them,
encourage them, and instruct them ; and if you give me
leave, and God His blessing, I do not doubt but the poor
ignorant souls shall be brought home to the great circle of
Christianity, if not to the particular faith we all embrace,
and that even while you stay here." Upon this I said, “I
shall not only give you leave, but give you a thousand
thanks for it."
I now pressed him for the third article in which we were
to blame. “ Why, really," says he, “ it is of the same
nature. It is about your poor savages, who are, as I may
say, your conquered subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that is,
or ought to be received among all Christians, of what
church or' pretended church soever, that the Christian
knowledge ought to be propagated by all possible means
and on all possible occasions.
our church sends missionaries into Persia, India, and
China ; and that our clergy, even of the superior sort,
willing engage in the most hazardous voyages, and the
most dangerous residence among murderers and barba-
rians, to teach them the knowledge of the true God, and
to bring them over to embrace the Christian faith. Now,
sir, you have such an opportunity here to have six- or
seven-and-thirty poor savages brought over from a state
of idolatry to the knowledge of God, their Maker and
Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pass such an occa-
sion of doing good, which is really worth the expense of a
man’s whole life.”
I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one word ,
to say. I had here the spirit of true Christian zeal for
God and religion before me. As for me, I had not so
much as entertained a thought of this in my heart before,
;and I believe I should not have thought of it : for I looked
l‘upon these savages as slaves, and people whom, had we

been sent to any country, so they had never seen their
own. I was confounded at his discourse, and knew not
what answer to make him ‘
He looked earnestly at me, seeing my confusion. “ Sir,’
say he, “ I shall be very sorry if what~ I have said gives
you any offense.” “ No, no," said I ; “ I am offended
with nobody but myself'; but I am perfectly confounded,
not only to think that I should never take any notice of
this before,.but with reflecting what notice I am able to
take of it now. You know, sir,” said I, “ what circum~
stances I am in; I am bound to the East'Indies in a ship
freighted by merchants, and to whom it would be an in-
sufferable piece of injustice to detain their ship here, the
men lying all this While at victuals and ' wages on the
0wne,rs’ account. It is true, I agreed to be allowed twelve
days here, and if I stay more, I must pay three pounds
sterling per diem demurrage ; nor can I stay upon demur-
rage above eight days more, and I have been here thir-
teen already ; so that I am perfectly unable to engage in
this work, unless I would suffer myself to be left behind
here again; in which case, if this single ship should mis-
carry in any part of her voyage, I should be just in the

which I had been so wonderfully delivered." He OWned
the case was very hard upon me as to my voyage ; but
laid it home upon my conscience whether the blessing of
saving thirty-seven souls was not worth venturing all I had
in the world for. I was not so sensible of that as he was.
I replied to him thus : “ Why. sir, it is a valuable thing,
indeed, to be an instrument in God's and to convert
thirty-seven heathens to the knowledge of Christ; but as
you are an ecclesiastic, and are given over to the work,
so it seems so naturally to fall in the way of your profession,
how is it, then, that you do not rather offer yourself to un-
dertake it than to press me to do it ?”
Upon_this he faced about just before me, as he walked
along, and putting me to a full stop, made me a very low
bow. “ I most heartily thank God and you, sir,” said he,
“for giving me so evident at call to so blessed a work;

and if you think yourself discharged from it, and
desire me to undertake it, I will most readily do it,
and think it a happy reward for all the hazards and
difficulties of such a broken, disappointed voyage as I
have met with, that I am dropped at last into so glorious
a work." '
I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke

the joy of being embarked in such a work. I paused a
considerable while before I could tell what to say to him;

and who seemed possessed of a zeal beyond the ordinary
rate of men. But after I had considered it awhile, I
asked him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he would
venture, on the single consideration of an attempt to con-
vert those poor people, to be locked up in an unplanted
island for perhaps his life,and at last not know whether he
should be able'to do them good 0 not P He turned short
upon me, and asked me what I ca led a venture. “Pray,
sir," said he, “what do you think I consented to go in
your ship to the East Indies for?" “ Nay," said I, “that
I know not, unless, unless it was to preach to the Indians."
“ Doubtless it was," said he ; “and do you think, if I can
convert these thirty-seven men to the faith of Jesus Christ,
it is not worth my time, though I should never be fetched

worth to save so many souls than my life is, or the life of
twenty more of the same profession? Yes, sir,” says he,
, “ “ I would give God thanks all my days if I could be made
the happy instrument of saving the souls of those poor
men, though I were never to get my foot off this island or
see my native country any more But since you will
honor me with putting me into this work, for which I will
pray for you all the days of my life, I have one humble
petition to you besides." “ What is that P ” said 1. “Why,”
says he, “it is, that you will, leave your man Friday
with me, to be my interpreter to them, and to assist
me ; for without some help I can not speak to them,
or they to me."
I was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because
I conld not think of parting with him, and that for many
reasons ; he had been the companion of my travels ; he
.3
was not only faithful to me, but sincerely affectionate to
the last degree ; and I had resolved to do something con-
siderable for him if he outlived me, as it was probable he
would. Then I knew that, as I had bred Friday up to be
' a Protestant, it would quite confound him to bring him to
embrace another religion ; and he would never, while his
eyes were open, believe that his old master was a heretic,
and would be damned ;and this might in the end ruin the
poor fellow’s principles, and so turn him back again to his

this strait, and it was this: I told him I could not say that
I was willing to part with Friday on any account what-
ever, though a work that to him was of more value than
his life ought to be of much more value than keeping or
parting with a servant. On the other hand, I was persuad-
ed that Friday would by no means agree to part with
me; and I could not force him to it without his con-
sent, without manifest injustice ; because I had promised
I would never send him away, and he had promised
andengaged that he would never leave me, unless I sent
him away.
He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had no
rational access to these poor people, seeing that he did
not understand one word of their language, nor they

When we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them all
together, and after some account given them of what I
had done for them—viz.,what necessary things I had pro-
vided for them, and how they were distributed, which
they were very sensible of, and very thankful for, I be-
gan to talk to them of the scandalous life they led, and

taken of it ; and arguing how unchristian and irreligious

or bachelors ? They soon explained their condition to
me, and showed that two of them were widowers, and the


other three were single men, or bachelors. I asked them
with what conscience they could take these women, and
call them their wives, and have so many children by them,
and not be lawfully married to them. They all gave me
the answer I expected—Aria, that there was nobody to
marry them ; that they agreed before the governor to
keep them as their wives; and they “thought as things
stood with them, they were as legally married as if they had
been married by a parson and with all the formalities in the
World.
I told them that no doubt they were married in the
sight of God, and were bound in conscience to keep them
as their ,wives ; but that the laws of men being otherwise,
they might desert the poor women and children hereafter,
and that their wives being poor desolate women, friend-
less and moneyless, would have no way to help them-
selves. I therefore told them that unless I Was assured
of their honest intent, I could do nothing for them, but
would take care that what I did should be for the
women and children without them; and that, unless
they would give me some assurance that they would
marry the women, I could not think it was convenient
they should continue together as man and wife ; for that
it was both scandalous to men and offensive to God,
_who they could not think would bless them if they went
on thus. .
All this went on as I expected ; and they told me,
especially Will Atkins, who now seemed to speak for the
rest, that they loved their wives as well as if they had
been born in their own native country, and would not
leave them on any account whatever ; and they did verily
believe that their wives were as virtuous and as modest,
and did,to the utmost of their skill, as much for them and
for their children, as any women could possibly do; and
they would not part with them on any account. Will
Atkins, for his own particular, added, that if any man
would take him away, and offer to carry him home to
England, and make him captain of the best mah-of-war
in the navy, he would not go with him if he might not
carry his wife and children with him ; and if there was a
clergyman in the ship, he would be married to her now
, with all his heart.
" LThis was just as I would have it. The priest was not
\.
with me at that moment, but he was not far off ; so to try
him further, I told him I had a clergyman with me, an ,
if he was sincere, I would have him married next morn-
ing, and bade him consider of it, and talk with the rest.
He said, as for himself, he need not consider of it at all,
for he was very ready to do it, and was glad I had a min-
ister with me, and he believed they would be all willing
also. I then told him that my friend, the minister, was a
Frenchman, and could not speak Eng1ish,but I would
act as clerk between them. He never so much as asked
me whether he was a Papist or Protestant, which was, in-
deed, what I was afraid of. We then parted, and I went
back to my clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to
talk with his companions. I desired the French gentle-
man not to say anything to them till the business was
thoroughly ripe; and I told him what answer the men had
given me.
Before I went from their quarter they all came to me
and told me they had been considering what I had said ;
that they were glad to hearI had a clergyman in my com-
pany, and they were very willing to give me the satisfaction . i
I desired, and to be formally married as soon as I pleased;
for they were far from desiring to part with their wives,
and that they meant nothing but-what was very honest
when they chose them. So I appointed them to meet me
the next morning ; and, in the meantime, they should
let their wives know the meaning of the marriage law; and
that it was not only to prevent any scandal, but also to
oblige them that they should not forsake them, whatever
mi%ht happen.
, he women were easily made sensible of the meanin
noems'ou causes 375
they had reason to be ; so they failed not to attend all
together at my apartment next morning, where I brought
out my clergyman; and though he had not on a minister’s
gown, after the manner of England, or the habit of a
priest, after the manner of France, yet having a black
vest, something like a cassock, with a sash round it, he
did not look very unlike a minister ; and as for his lan-
guage, I was his interpreter. But the seriousness of his
ehavior to them, and the scruples he made of marrying
the women, because they were not baptised and professed
Christians, gave them an exceeding reverence for his per-
v *' *' x - xs‘x;z
son, and there was no need, after that, to inquire whether
he was a clergyman or not. Indeed, I was afraid his scru-
ples would have been carried so far as that he would not
have married them at all ; nay, notwithstanding all I was
able to say to him, he resisted me, though modestly, yet
very steadily, and at last refused absolutely to marry them,

376 ROBINSON cnvson. ‘
at last I agreed to it with a good will, perceiving the sin-
cerity of his design.
When he came to them he let them know that I had
acquainted him with their circumstances, and with the
present design ; that he was very willing to perform that
part of his function, and marry them, as I had desired ;
but that before he could do it, he must take the liberty to
talk with them. He told them that in the sight of all in-
different men, and in the sense of the laws of society, they
had lived all the while in a state of sin ; and that it was
true that nothing but the consenting to marry, or effectu-
ally separating them from one another, could now put an

Christian to a savage, an idolater, and a heathen—one
that is not baptized ;‘ and yet that he did notvsee that
there was time left to endeavor to persuade the women
to be baptized, or to profess the name of Christ, whom
they had, be doubted, heard nothing of, and without
which they could not be baptized. He told them he
doubted they were but indifferent Christians themselves ;
that they had but little knowledge of God or of His ways,
and, therefore, he could not expect that they had said
much to their wives on that head yet; but that unless
they would promise him to use their endeavors with their
wives to persuade them to become Christians, and would,
as Well as they could, instruct them in the knowledge and
belief of God that made them, and to worship JesusI
Christ that redeemed them, he could not marry them ; for
he would have no hand in joining Christians with savages,
nor was it consistent with the principles of the Chris-
tian religion, and was, indeed, expressly forbidden in
~ God’s law.
They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it
"""" W ,—— _?§r_'T_"—_?‘:‘r
very faithfully to them from his mouth, as near his own
words as I could ,' only sometimes adding something of
my own to convince them how just it was, and that I was
of his mind ; and I always very faithfully distinguished
between what I said from myself and what were the
clergyman’s words. The told me it was very true what
the gentleman said, that they were very indifferent Chris-
tians themselves,and that they had never talked to their
wives about religion. “ Lord, sir,” says Will Atkins, “how
should we teach them religion ? Why, we know nothing
ourselves ; and, besides, sir,” said he, “ should we talk to
them of God and Jesus Christ, and heaven and hell, it
would make them laugh at us, and ask us what we believe
ourselves. And if we should tell them that we believe all
the things we speak to them, such as of good people go-
ing to heaven, and wicked people to the devil, they would
ask us where we intend to go ourselves, that believe all
this, and are such wicked fellows as we indeed are? Why,

hearing ; folks must have some religion themselves before
they begin to teach other people.” “Will Atkins," said
I to to him, “though I am afraid that what you say has
too much truth in it, yet can you not tell your wife she is
in the wrong ; that there is a God, and a religion better
than her own ; that her gods are idols; that they can
neither hear nor speak ; that there is, a great Being that
made all things, and that can destroy all that He has
made ; that He rewards the good and punishes the bad;
and that we are to be judged by Him at last for all we do
here ? You are not so ignorant, but even nature itself
ROBINSON CRUSOE. ’ i 377
know it all to be true, and believe it yourself.” “ That is
true, sir,” said Atkins; “ but with what face can I say any-
thing to my wife of all this, when she will tell me im-
mediately it can not be true ? ” “ Not true ! " said I.
“ What do you mean by that ? ” “ Why, sir,” said he, f she
will tell me it can not be true that this God I shall tell her
of can be just, or can punish or reward, since I am not
punished and sent to the devil, that have been such a
wicked creature as she knows 'I have been, even to her,
and to everybody else ; and that I should be suffered to
live, that have been always acting s0 contrary to what I
must tell her is good, and to what I ought to have done."
“Why, truly, Atkins," said I, “ I am afraid thou speakest
too much truth ; ” and with that I informed the clergyman
of what Atkins had said, for he was impatient to know.
“ Oh,” said the priest, “ tell him there is one thing will
make him the best minister in the world to his wife, and
that is repentance; for nune teach repentance like true
penitents. He wants nothing but to repent, and then he

and that He is the just rewarder of good and evil, and

ness and long suffering ,forbears to punish those that
offend ; waiting to be gracious, and willing not the death
of a sinner, but rather he should return and live ; and even
reserves damnation to the general day of retribution ;
that is a clear evidence of God and of a future state that
righteous men receive not their reward, or wicked men
their punishment, till they come into another world ; and
this will lead him to teach his wife the doctrine of the
resurrectionand of the last judgment. La him but re-
pent himself ; he will be an excellent preacher of repen-
tance to his wife.”
I repeated all this-to Atkins, who looked very serious
all the while, and, as we could easily perceive, was more
than ordinarily affected with it; when being eager, and
hardly suffering me to make an end, “ I know all this,
master," says he, “ and a great deal more ; but I have not
the impudence to talk thus to my wife, when God and my
conscience know, and my wife will be an undeniable evi-
dence against me, that I have lived as if I never heard of
a God or a future state, or Anything about it ; and to talk
of my repenting, alas! (and with that he fetched a deep
sigh, and I could see that the tears stood in his eyes) ’tis
past all that with me.” “Past it, Atkins,” said I; “what
dost thou mean by that P" “ I know well enough what I
mean,” says he; “I mean ’tis too late, and that is too
true."
I told the clergyman, word for word, what he said, and
this affectionate man could not refrain from tears ; but
vrecovering himself, said to me, “ Ask him but one ques-
tion : Is he easy that it is too late ; or is be troubled, and
wishes it were not so P” I put the question fairly to At~
kins; and he anSWered, with a great deal of passion, “ HOW
coulo any man be easy in a condition that must certainly
end in eternal destruction? that he was far from being
easy ; but that, on the contrary, he believed it would one
time or other ruin him.” “ What do you mean by that ?"
said 1. “Why,” he said, “he believed he should one time
or other out his throat, to put an end to the terror of it.”
The clergyman shook his head, with great concern in
his face, when I told him all this; but turning quick to me
upon it, says, “ If that be his case, we may assure him it
is not too late ; Christ will give him repentance. But
pray,” says he, “ explain this to him ; that as no man is
saved but by Christ, and the merit of His passion procur-
ing divine mercy for him, how can it be too late for any
man to receive mercy? Does he think he is able to sin be»
yond the power or reach of divine mercy? Pray tell him
there may be a time when provoked mercy will no longer
strive, and when God may refuse to bear, but that it is
never too late for men to ask mercy; and we, that are
Christ's servants, are commanded to preach mercy at all
times, in the name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sin-
cerely repent; so that it is never too late to repent."
I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earn-
estness; but it seemed as if he turned off the discourse to
the rest, for he said to me he would go and have some
talk with his wife; so he went out awhile, and we talked to
the rest. D‘perceived they were all stupidly ignorant as to
matters of religion, as much as I was when I went ram-
bling away from my father; yet there were none of them
backward to hear what had been said ; and all of them
seriously promised that they would talk with their wives
about it, and do their endeavors to persuade them to turn
Christians. '
The cleryman smiled upon me when I reported what
answer they gave, but said nothing a good while ; but at
last, shaking his head, “ We that are Christ’s servants,”
says he, “can go no further than to exhort and instruct ;
and when men comply, submit to the reproof, and prom-
isewhat we ask, 'tis all we can do ; we are bound to ac-
cept their good words ; but believe me, sir,” said he,
“ whatever you may have known of the life of that man

and I doubt not, when he comes to talk of religion to his
wife, he will talk himself effectually into it ; for attempt-
ing to teach, others is sometimes the best way of teaching
ourselves. If that poor Atkins begins but once to talk
seriously of Jesus Christ to his wife, he will assuredly talk
himself into a thorough convert, make himself a penitent,
and who knows what may follow P"
Upon this discourse, however, and their promising, as
above, to endeavor to persuade their wives to embrace
Christianity, he married the two other couple; but Will
Atkins and his wife were not yet come in. After this, my
clergyman, waiting awhile, was anxious to know where
Atkins was gone, and turning to me, said: “ I entreat you,
sir, let us walk out of your labyrinth here and look ; I

talking seriously to his wife, and teaching her already
something of religion." I began to be of the same mind;
so we went out together, and I carried him a way which
none knew but myself, and where the trees were so very
thick that it was not easy to see through the thicket of
leaves, and far harder to see in than to see out ; when,
coming to the edge of the wood, I saw Atkins and his
tawny wife sitting under the shade of a bush, very eager
in discourse ; I stopped short till my clergyman came up
to me, and then having showed him where they were, we
stood and looked very steadily at them a good while. We
observed him very earnest with her, pointing up to the
sun, and to every quarter of the heavens, and then down
to the earth, then out to the sea, then to himself, then to
her, to the woods, to the trees. “ Now,” says the clergy-
man, “ you see my words are made good; the man preaches
to her ; mark him now, he is telling her that our God has
made him, her, and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the
woods, the trees, etc." “ I believe he is,” said I. Imme-
diately we perceived Will Atkins start upon his feet, fall
down on his knees, and lift up both his hands. We sup-
posed he said something, but we could not hear him ; it
was too far for that. He did not continue kneeling half
a minute, but comes and sits down again by his wife, and
talks to her again; we perceived then the woman very at-
tentive, but whether she said anything to him we could
not tell. While the poor fellow was upon his knees ,I
could see the tears run plentifully down my clergyman 5
cheeks, and I could hardly forbear myself : but it was a
great affliction to us both that we were not near enough to
hear anything that passed between them. Well, however,
we could come no nearer for fear of disturbing them ; so
we resolved to see an end of this piece of still conversa-
tion, and it spoke loud enough to us without the help of
voice. He sat down again, as I have said, close by her,
and talked again earnestly to her, and two or three times .
we could see him embrace her most passionately ; another
time we saw him take out his handkerchief and wipe her
eyes, and then kiss her again with a kind of transport very
unusual ; and after several of these things, we saw him on
a sudden jump up again, and lend her his hand to help
her up, when immediately leading her by the hand a step
or two, they both kneeled down together, and continued
so about two minutes.
My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud,
“St. Paul! St. Paul' behold he prayeth.'_’ I was afraid
Atkins would hear him, therefore I entreated him to with-
hold himself awhile, that we might see an end of the scene,
which to me, I must confess, was the most affecting that
ever I saw in my life. Well, he strove with himself for
awhile, but was in such raptures to think that the poor
heathen woman was become a Christian, that he was not
able to contain himself ; he wept several times, then
throwing up his hands and crossing his breast, said over
several things ejaculatory, and by the way of giving God
thanks for so miraculous a testimony of the success of our
endeavors. Some he spoke softly, and I could not well
hear others; some things he said in Latin, some in French;
then two or three times the tears would interrupt him,
that he could not speak at all ; but I begged that he
would contain himself, and let us more narrowly and
fully observe what was before us, which he did for a time,
the scene not being near ended yet; for after the poor
man and his wife were risen again from their knees, we
observed he stood talking still eagerly to her, and we
observed her motion, that she was greatly affected with
what he said, by her frequently lifting up her hands, lay-
ing her hand to her breast, and such other postures as ex-
press the greatest seriousness and attention; this continued
about half a quarter of an hour, and then they walked
away, so we could see no more ofihem in that situation.

was glad to see the particulars we had both been witnesses
to; that, though I was hard enough of belief in such cases,
yet that I began to think it was all very sincere here, both
in the man and his wife, however ignorant they might
both be, and I hoped such a beginning would yet have a
more happy end. “ But, my friend,” added I, “ will you

how to object the least thing against that affectionate con-
cern which you show for the turning of the poor people
from their paganism to the Christian religion; but how
does this comfort you, while these people are, in your ac-
count, out of the pale of the Catholic Church, without
which you believe there is no salvation? so that you esteem
these but heretics, as effectually lost as the pagans them-
selves.”
To this he answered, with abundance of candor, thus:
“ Sir, I am a Catholic of the Roman Church, and a priest
of the order of St. Benedict, and I embrace all the prin-
ciples of the Roman faith; but yet, if you will believe me,
and that I do not speak in compliment to you, or in re-
spect to my circumstances and your civilities; I say, never-
theless, I do not look upon you, who call yourselves re-
formed, without some charity. I dare not say (though I
know it is our opinion in general) that you can not be
saved; I will by no means limit the mercy of Christ so far
asto think that He can not receive you in to the bosom'oi
His Church, in a manner to us unperceivable; and I hope
you have the same charity for us; I pray daily for you be-
ing all restored to Christ’s Church, by whatsoever method
He, who is all-wise, is pleased to direct. In the mean-
time, surely you will allow it consists with me as a Roman
to distinguish far between a Protestant and a pagan ; be-
tween one that calls on Jesus Christ, though in a way
which I do not think is according to the true faith, and a
savage or a barbarian, that knows no God, no Christ, no
Redeemer; and if you are not within the pale of the Cath-
olic Church, we hope you are nearer being restored to it
than those who know nothing of God or of His Church ;
and Irejoice, therefore, when I see this poor man. who

it to the goodness of Christ to perfect His work in His

Sincere and Worthy Character of the Priest.—-Dialogue with Will
Atkins and Diwali—Conversation Betwixt Atkins and His Indian
Wife on the Subject of Religion—Her Baptlsm.—Settlement of the
Commonwealth.
I WAS astonished at the sincerity and temper of this
pious Papist, as much as I was oppressed by the power of
his reasoning , and it presently occurred to m thoughts,
that if such a temper was universal, we might e all Cath-
olic Christians, whatever church or particular profession
We joined in : that a spirit of charity would soon work its
all up into right principles; and as he thought that the
like charity would make us all Catholics, so I told him I
believed, had all the members of his church the like mods
eration, they would soon all be Protestants. And there
we left that part; for we never disputed at all. However,
I talked to him another way, and taking him by the hand,
“ My friend,", says I, “ I wish all the clergy of the Rom-
ish Church were blessed with such moderation, and had
an equal share of your charity. I am entirely of your
opinion ; but I must tell you that if you should preach
such doctrine in Spain or Italy, they would put you into
the Inquisition." _ “It may be so," said he : “ I know not
384 ' ' ROBINSON cRusOE. '
what they would do in Spain or Italy, but I will not saj
they would be the better Christians for that severity ; for
I am sure there is no heresy in abounding with charity.”
Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our busi-
ness there was over, so we went back our own way ; and
when we came back, we found them waiting to be called
in; observing this, I asked my clergyman if we should dis-
cover to him that we had seen him under the bush or not;
and it was his opinion we should not, but that we should
384 ' ' ROBINSON cRusOE. '
called him in alone, nobody being in the place but our-‘
selves, and I began by asking him some particulars about
his parentage and education. He told me frankly enough
that his father was a clergyman who would have taught
him well, but that he, Will Atkins, despised all instruction
and correction; and by his brutish conduct cut the thread
of all his father’s comforts and shortened his days, for
that he broke his heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural
return for the most affectionate treatment a father ever
' ave.
g In what he said there seemed so much sincerity of re-
pentance, that it painfully affected me. I could not but
reflect that I, too, had shortened the life of a good, tender
father, by my bad conduct and obstinate self-will. I was,
indeed, so surprised with what he had told me, that I
thought, instead of my going to teach and instruct him,
the man was made a teacher and instructor to me in a
most unexpected manner.
I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was
greatly affected with it, and said to me, “ Did I not say,
sir, that when this man was converted he would preach to
us all? I tell 'you, sir, if this one man be made a true
penitent, there will be no need of me ; he will make
Christians of all in the island.” But having a little com-
posed myself, I renewed my discourse with Will Atkins.
“ But, Will,” said 1, “how comes the sense of this matter
to touch you just now P"
W. A.——Sir, you have set me about a work that has
struck a dart through my very soul ; I have been talking
about God and religion to my wife, in order, as you
directed me, to make a Christian of her, and she has
preached such a sermon to me as I shall never forget
while I live.
R. C.—No, no, it is not your wife has preached to you ;
but when you were moving religious arguments to her,

W. A.—Ay, sir, with "such force as is not to be resisted.
R. C.—Pray, Will, let us know what passed between
you and your wife : for I know something of it already.
W. A.--Sir, it is impossible to give you a full accoum:
of it ; I am too full to hold it, and yet have no tongue to
express it ; but let her have said what she will, though I
can not give you an account of it, this I can tell you, that
I have resolved to amend and reform my life.
R. C.—But tell us some of it: how did you begin, Will?
For this has been an extraordinary case, that is certain.

this upon you. \

about marriage, and what the reasons were that men and
women were obliged to enter into such compacts as it was
neither in the power of one nor other to break; that other-
wise, order and justice could not be maintained, and men
would run from their wives, and abandon their children,
mix confusedly with one another, and neither families he
kept entire, nor inheritances be settled by legal descent.
R. C.—Vou talk like a civilian, Will. Could you make
her understand what you meant by inheritance and fami-
lies? They know no such thing among the savages, but
marry anyhow, without regard to relation, consanguinity,
or family ; brother and sister, nay, as I have been told, even
the father and the daughter, and the son and the mother.
W. A.——I believe, sir, you are misinformed, and 'my
wife assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it;
perhaps, for any further relations, they may not be so ex-
act as we are ; but she tells me never in the near relation-
ship you speak.
R. C.—Well, what did she say to what you told her?
W. A.—She said she liked it very well, as it was much
better than in her country.
R. C.—But did you tell her what marraige was?
W. A.—Ay, ay, there began our dialogue. I asked her
if she would be married to me our way. She asked me
what way that was ; I told her marriage was appointed b
God; and here we had a strange talk together, indee
as ever man and wife had, I believe.
N. B—This dialogue between Will Atkins and his wife,
which I took down in writing just after he told it me, was
as follows :
Wife.—~Appointed by your God! Why, have you a God
in your country ?
W. A.——Yes, my dear, God is in every country.
Wife—No your God in my country ; my country have
the great old Benamuckee God.

God is in heaven and made the heaven and the earth, the
sea, and all that in them is.
Wife—No makee de earth ; no you God makee all
earth ; no makee my country.
Will Atkins laughed a little at her expression of God
not making her country.
Wife—No laugh ; why laugh me?

W. A.——That’s true, indeed ; I will not laugh any more,
my dear.
Wife—Why you say you God makee all .P
W. A.—Yes, child, our God made the whole world, and
you, and me, and all things ; for He is the only true God,
and there is no God but Him; He lives forever in heaven.
Wife—Why you no tell me long ago?
W. A.—-—That’s true, indeed ; but I have been a wicked
wretch, and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with
anything before, but have lived without God in the world
myself.
\ Wife—What, have you a great God in your country,
you no know him? No say oh to Him? No do good
ting for Him P That no possible.
W. A.——It is true ; though, for all that, we live as if
there Was no God in heaven, or that He had no power on
earth.
Wife—But why God let you do so? Why He no makee
you good live P
W. A.——It is all our own fault.
Wife—But you say me He is great, much great, have
much great power; can makee kill when He will: why He
no makee kill when you no serve Him? no say oh to
Him? no be good mans.

W. A.—That is true, He might strike me dead ; and I
ought to expect, for I have been a wicked wretch, that is
true ; but God is merciful, and does not deal with us as
we deserve.
Wife—But then do you not tell God thankee for that
too ? r
W. A. — No, indeed, I have not thanked God for
His mercy, any more than I have feared God from His
power. _ -
Wife—Then you God no God ; me no tink, believe He
be such one, great much pOWer, strong: no makee kill you,
though you make Him much angry.
W. A.—What, will my wicked life hinder you from be-
lieving in God ? Whata dreadful creature am I ! and what
a sad truth is it, that the horrid lives of Christians hinder
the conversion of heathens!
Wife—How me tink you have great much God up
there [she points up to heaven], and yet no do well,
no do good ting? Can he tell? Sure He no tell what
you do? '
W. A,—-Yes, yes, He knows and sees all things; He
hears us speak, sees what we do, knows what we think,
though we 0 not speak.
Wife—W at ! He no hear you curse, swear, speak do
great damn?
W. A.-—Yes, Yes, He hears it all.
Wife—Where be then the much great power strong?
W. A.—He is merciful, that is all we can say for it; and
this proves Him to be the true God ; He is God, and not
man, and therefore we are not consumed.
[Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with horror to
think how he could tell his wife so clearly that God sees,
and hears, and knows the secret thoughts of the heart,
and all that we do, and yet that he had dared to do all
the vile things he had done]
Wife—Merciful i What you call dat?
W. A.—He is our Father and Maker, and He pities and I
spares us. '-

when you do wicked; then He no good Himself, or no

Wife—Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead ; what
you say to Him for that? You no tell Him thankee for
all that too?
W. A.—I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that is
true.
Wife—Why He no makee you much good better? you
say He makee you.
W. A.—-He made me as He made all the world : it is I
have deformed myself and abused His goodness, and
made myself an abominable wretch.
Wife—I wish you makee God know me. I no makee
Him angry—I no do bad wicked ting.
[Here Will Atkins said his heart sank within him to
hear a poor untaught creature desire to be taught to know
God, and he such a wicked wretch, that he could not say
one word to her about God, but what the reproach of his
own carriage would make most irrational to her to believe;
nay, that already she had told him that she could not be-
- lieve in God, because he, that was so wicked, was not de-
stroyed]
W. A.—My dear, you mean, you wish I could teach you
to know God, not God to know you ; for He knows you
already, and every thought in your heart.
Wife—Why, then, He know what I say to you now ;
He know me wish to know Him. How shall‘me know who
makee me?
W. A.--Poor creature, He must teach thee : I can
not teach thee. I will pray to Him to teach thee to
know Him, and forgive me, that am unworthy to teach
thee.
[The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring
him to make her know vGod, and her wishing to know
Him, that he said he fell down on his knees before her,


and prayed to God to enlighten her mind with the sav-
ing knowledge of Jesus Christ, and to pardon his sins,
and accept of his being the unworthy instrument of in-
structing her in the principles of religion ; after which he
sat down by her again, and their dialogue went on. This
was the time when we saw him kneel down and hold up
his hands]
Wife—What you put down the knee for? What you
hold up the hand for? What you say? Who you speak to?
What is all that P
W. A.—My dear, I bow my knees in token of my sub-
mission to Him that made me : I said oh to Him, as you
call it, and as your old men do to their idol Benamuckee;
that is I prayed to Him.
Wife—What say you oh to him for?
W. A.—I prayed to him to open your eyes and your
understanding, that you may know Him and be accepted
by Him.
Wife—Can He do that too?
W. A.—Yes, He can : He can do all things.
Wife—But now He hear what you say?
W. A.—Yes, He has bid us pray to Him, and promised
to hear us
Wife—Bid you pray! When He bid you? How He
bid you 7 What you hear Him speak ?
W. A.—No, we do not hear Him speak; but He has re-
vealed Himself in many ways to us. .
[Here he was at a great loss to make her under-
stand that God has revealed Himself to us by His Word,
and what His Word was; but at last he told it to her
thus ;
W. ]A.—God has spoken to some good men in former
days. even from heaven, by plain words ; and God has in-
spired good men by His Spirit ; and they have written all
His laws down in a book.
Wife—Me no understand that ; where is book?
W. A.—-Alas ! my poor creature, I' have not this book ;
but I hope I shall one time or other get it for you, and
help you to read it.

expressible grief that he had not a Bible]
Wife—But how you makee me know that God teachee
them to write that book?


W. A.—.By the same rule that we know him to be
God. '
Wife—What rule? What way you know Him ?
W. A.—Because He teaches and commands nothing but
what is good, righteous, and holy, and tends to make
us perfectly good, as well as perfectly happy; and be-
cause he forbids and commands us to avoid all that
is wicked, all that is evil in itself, or evil in its conse-
quence.
Wife.—-—That me would understand, that me fain see; if
He teacheeall good thing, He makee all good thing, He
give all thing, He hear me when I say oh to Him, as
you do just now; He makee me good if I wish to be good;
He spare me, no makee kill me, when I no be good ; all
this you say He do, yet He be great God ; me take, think,
believe Him to be great God; me say oh to Him With
you, my dear.
Here the poor man could forbear no longer, but raised
her up, made her kneel by him, and he prayed to God
aloud to instruct her in the knowlegde of Himself, by His
Spirit; and that by some good providence, if possible,
she might, some time or other, come to have a Bible, that
she might read the word of God, and be taught by it
to know Him. This was the time that we saw him lift
her up by the hand, and saw him kneel down by her,
as above. \ x '
They had several other discourses, it seems, after this;
and particularl she made him promise that, since be con-
fessed his own ife had been a wicked, abominable course
of provocations against God, that _he would reform it, and
not make God angry any more, lest He should make him
dead, as she called it, and then she would be left alone.
and never be taught to know this God better ; and lest he
should be miserable,as he had told her wicked men would
be after death.
This Was a strange account, and very affecting to us
both, but particularly to the young clergyman ;he was,
indeed, wonderfully surprised with it, but under the great-

that he could not speak English to make her understand
him ; and as she spoke but very broken English, he could
not understand her ; however, he turned himself to me,
and told me that he believed that there must be more to
do with this woman than to marry her. I did not unders

viz., that she ought to be baptized. I agreed with him in
that part readily, and wished it to be done presently.
“ No, no ; hold, sir,” says he ; “though I would have her
be baptized, by all means. for I must observe that Will
Atkins, her husband, has indeed brought her, in a wonder-
ful manner, to be willing to embrace a religious life, and
has given her just ideas of the being of a God; of
His power, justice, and. mercy: yet I desire to know
of him if he has said anything to her of Jesus Christ,
and 0f the salvation of sinners; of the nature of faith
in Him, and redemption by Him; of the Holy Splrit,
the resurrection, the last judgment, and the future
state.”
I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but the
the poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us
he had said something to her of all those thing, but
that he was himself so wicked a creature, and his own
conscience so reproached him with his horrid, ungodly
life, that he trembled at the apprehensions that the knowl-
edge of him should lesson the attention she should give
to those things, and make her rather contemn religion
than receive it; but he was assured, he said, that her
mind was so disposed to receive due impression of all those
things, and that if I would but discourse with her, she
would make it appear to my satisfaction that my labor
would not be lost upon her.
Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself as inter-
preter between my religious priest and the woman. I en-
{treated him to begin with her ; but sure such a sermon
Iwas never preached by a Popish priest in these latter ages
of the world ; and as I told him, I thought he had all the
'zeal, all the knowledge, all the sincerity of a Christian,
without the error of a Roman Catholic; and that I
took him to be such a clergyman as the Romam bish-
ops were before the Church of Rome assumed spiritual
soverignty over the consciences of men. In a word, he
brought the poor woman to embrace the knowledge of
Christ, and of redemption by Him, not with wonder and

but with joy and faith ; with an affection, and a surpris-
ing degree of understanding, scarce to be imagined, much

less to be expressed ; and, at her own request, she was
baptized.
When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated him

the man might not perceive he was of the Roman Church,
if possible, because of other ill consequences which might
attend a difference among us in that very religion which
we were instructing the other in. He told me that as he
had no consecrated chapel, nor proper things for the

should not know by it that he was a Roman Catholic my-
self, if I had not known it before ; and so he did ; for say-
ing only some words over to himself in Latin, which I
could not understand, he poured a whole dishful of water
upon the woman's head, pronouncing in French, very
loud, “ Mary,” (which was the name her husband desired
me to give her, for I was her godfather), “ I baptize thee
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost ; ” so that none could know anything by
it what religion he was of. Hev gave the benediction
afterward in Latin, but either Will Atkins did not know
but it was French, or else did not take notice of it at
that time.
As soon as this was over we married them; and after
the marriage was over, he turned to Will Atkins, and in a
very affectionate manner exhorted him, not only to per-
severe in that good disposition he was in, but to sup-
port the convictions that were upon him by a resolu-
tion to reform his life; told him it was in vain he re-
pented if he did not forsake his crimes; represented to
him how God had honored him with being the instru~
ment of bringing his wife to the knowledge of the Chris-
tian religion, and that he should be careful he did not dis-
honor the grace of 'God ; and that if he did, he would see
the heathen a better Christian than himself ; the savage
converted, and the instrument cast away. He said a great
many good things to them both ; and then, recommend-
ing them to God’s goodness, gave them the benediction
again, I repeating everything to them in English ;and thus
ended the ceremony. I think it was the most pleasant
and agreeableday to me that ever I passed in my whole
life. But my clergyman had not done yet: his thoughts
hung continually upon the conversion of the thirty-seven
savages, and fain he would have stayed upon the island to

dertaking was impracticable in itself ; and, secondly, that
perhaps I would put it into a way of being done in his ab-
sence to his satisfaction.
Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a narrow
compass, I was preparing to go on board the ship, when
the young man I had taken out of the famished ship’s
company-came to me, and told me he understood I had a
clergyman with me, and that I had caused the Englishmen
to be married to the savages: that he had a match too,

two Christians, which he hoped would not be disagreeable
to me. ‘
I knew this must be the young woman who was his
mother’s servant, for there was no other Christian woman
on the island : so I began to persuade him not to do any-
thing of that kind rashly, or because he found himself in
this solitary circumstance. I represented to him that he
had some considerable substance in the world, and good
friends, as I understood by himself, and the maid also;
that the maid was not only poor, and a servant, but was
unequal to him, she being six- or seven-and-twenty years
old, and he not above seventeen or eighteen ; that he
might very probably, with my assistance, make a remove
from this wilderness, and come into his own country again;
and that then it would be a thousand to one but he would
repent his choice, and the dislike of that circumstance
might be advantageous to both. I was going to say more,
but he interrupted me, smiling, and told me, with a great
deal of modesty, that I mistook in my guesses—that he
had nothing of that kind in his thoughts ; and he was very
glad to hear that I had an intent of putting them in a way
to see their own country again ; and nothing should have
made him think of staying there, but that the voyage I
was going was so exceeding long and hazardous, and
would carry him quite out of the reach of all his friends ;
that he had nothing to desire of me but that I would set-
tle him in some little property in the island where he was,
give him a servant or two, and some few necessaries, and
he would live here like a planter, waiting the good time
when, if ever I returned to England, I would redeem him.
He hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I came
to England: that he would give me some letters to his
friends in London, to let them know how good I had
been to him, and in what part of the world, and what cir.
cumstances I had left him in: and he promised me that
whenever I redeemed him, the plantation, and all the im-
provements he had made upon it, let the value be what it
would, should be wholly mine.
His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering
his youth, and was the more agreeable to me, because he
told me positively the match was not for himself. I gave,
him all pOssible assurances that if I lived to come safe to
England, I would deliver his letters, and do his business
effectually; and that he might depend I should never for-
get the circumstances I had left him ; but still Iv was im-
patient to know who was the person to be married ; upon
which he told me it was my ]ack~of-all-trades and his
maid Susan. I was most agreeably surprised when he
named the match ; for, indeed, I thought it very suitable.
The character of that man I have given already ; and as
the old maid, she was a very honest, modest, sober, and
religious young woman : had a very good share of sense,
was agreeable enough in her person, spoke very handy
somely and to the purpose, always with decency and good
manners, and was neither too backward to speak when
requisite, nor impertiuently forward when it was not her
business; very handy and housewifely, and an excellent

island; and she knew very well how to behave in every
respect.
The match being proposed in this manner, we married
them the same day ; and as I was father at the altar, and
gave her away, so I gave her a portion ; for I appointed
her and her husband a handsome large space of ground
for their plantation ; and, indeed, this match, and the pro-
posal the young gentleman made to give him a small
property in the island, put me upon parceling it out
among them, that they might not quarrel afterward about
their situation. ‘
This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins,
who was now grown a sober, grave, managing fellow, per-
fectly reformed, exceedingly pious and religious ; and, as
far as I may be allowed to speak positively in such a case,
I verily believe he was a true penitent. He divided things

so justly, and so much to every one’s satisfaction, that
they only desired one general writing under my hand for
the whole, which I caused to be drawn up, and signed and
sealed, setting out the bounds and situation of every man's
plantation, and testifying that I gave them thereby ‘sever-
ally a right to the whole possession and inheritance of the
respective plantations or farms, with their improvements,
to them and their heirs, reserving all the rest of the island
as my own property, and a certain rent for every particu-
lar plantation after eleven years, if I, or any one from me,
or in my name, came to demand it, producing an attested
copy of the same writing. As to the government and laws
among them, I told them I was not capable of giving them
better rules than they were able to give themselves ; only
I made them promise me to live in love and. good neigh<
borhood with one another ; and so I prepared to leave
them.
One thing I must not omit, and that is, that being now
settled in a kind of commonwealth among themselves, and
having much business in hand, it was odd to have seven-
and-thirty Indians live in a nook of the island, independ-
ent, and, indeed, unemployed ; for except the providing

sometimes they had no manner of business or property to
manage. I proposed, therefore, to the governor Spaniard,
that he should go to them, with Friday’s father, and pro-
pose to them to remove, and either plant for themselves,
or be taken into their several families as servants, to be
maintained for their labor, but without being absolute
slaves ; for I would not permit them to make them slaves
by force, by any means ; because they had their liberty
given them by capitulation, as it were, articles of surren-
der, which they ought not to break.
They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came
all very cheerfully along with him : so we allotted them
land and plantations, which three or four accepted of, but
all the rest chose to be employed as servants in the sev-
eral families we had settled. Thus my colony was in a
manner settled as follows: The Spaniards possessed my
original habitation, which was the capital city, and ex-
tended their plantations all along the side of the brook,
which made the creek that I have so often described, as
far as my bower; and as they increased their culture, it

went always eastward. The English lived in the north-
east part, where Will Atkins and his comrades began, and
came on southward and south-west, toward the back part
of the Spaniards ; and every plantation had a great addi-
tion of {and to take in, if they found occasion, so that
they need not jostle one another for want of room. All

of the savages should come on shore there only for their
usual customary barbarities, that they might come and go,

and no doubt but they Were often ashore, and went away
again ; for I never heard that the planters were ever at-
tacked or disturbed any more.

IT now came into my thoughts that I had hinted to my
friend the clergyman that the work of converting the sav-
ages might perhaps be set on foot in his absence to his
satisfaction, and I told him that now I thought that it was
put in a fair way; for the savages, being thus divided
among the Christians, if they would but every one of them
do their part with those which came under their hands, I
hoped it might have a very good effect.
He agreed presently in that, if they did their part.
“But how,” says he, “shall we obtain that of them ?" I
told him we would call them all together, and leave it in
charge with them, or go to them one by one, which he
thought best ; so we divided it—he to speak to the Span-
iards, who were all Papists, and I .to speak to the English,
who were all Protestants; and we recommended it earn-
estly to them, and made them promise that they would
never make any distinction of Papist or Protestant in their
exhorting the savages to turn Christians, but teach them
the general knowledge of the true God, and of their Sav—
iour Jesus Christ; and they likewise promised us that they
would never have any differences or disputes one with an-
other about religion.
When I came to Will Atkins’s house, I found there the
young woman I have mentioned above, and Will Atkins's
wife, were become intimate; and this prudent, religious
young woman had perfected the work Will Atkins had be-
gun ; and though it was not aboue four days after what I
have related, yet the new-baptized savage woman was
made such a Christian as I have seldom heard of in all my
observation or conversation in the world. It came next
int0'my mind in the morning before I went to them, that
among all the needful things I had to leave with them I
had not left them a Bible, in which I showed myself less
considering for them than my good friend the widow
was for me when she sent me the cargo of a hundred
'pounds from Lisbon, where she packed up three Bibles
and a Prayer-book. However, the good woman's char-
ity had a greater extent than ever she imagined, for
they were reserved for the comfort and instruction of
those that made much better use of them them than I
had done. '
I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I
came to Will Atkins’s tent, or house, and found the young
woman and Atkins’s baptized wife had been discours-
ing of religion together—for Will Atkins told it me with
a great deal of joy_-I asked if they were together now,
and he said, “ Yes;” so I went into the house, and he
with me, and we found them together very earnest in
discourse. “ Oh, sir,” says Will Atkins, “when God has
sinners to reconcile to Himself, and aliens to bring
home, He never wants a messenger; my wife has got
a new instructor; I knew I was unworthy as I was in-
capable of that work; that young woman has been sent
hither from heaven-—she is enough to convert a whole
island of savages." The young woman blushed, and rose
up to go away, but I desired her to sit still; Itold her she
had a good work upon her hands, and I hoped God would
bless her in it.
We talked a little, and I did not perceive that they had
any book among them, though I did not ask ; but I put
my hand into my pocket, and pulled out my Bible.
“Here,” said I to Atkins," “I have brought you an
assistant that perhaps you had not before.” The man
was so confounded that he was not able to speak for
some time; but, recovering himself, he takes it with
both his hands, and turning to his wife, “Here, my
dear,” says he, “did not I tell you our God, though he
\


lives above, could hear what we have said? Here's the
book I prayed for when you and 1 kneeled down under
the bush; now God has heard us and sent it." When
he had said so, the man fell into such passionate trans-
ports that, between the joy Of having it, and giving God
thanks for it, the tears ran down his face like a child that
Was crying.
The woman was surprised, and was like to have run in-

persuaded the poor woman to have believed that an ex-
press messenger came from heaven on purpose to bring
that individual book. But it was too serious a matter
to suffer any delusion to take place, so I turned to the
young woman, and told her we did not desire to im-

ant understanding of things, and begged her to explain
to her that God may be very properly said to answer
our petitions, when in the course of His providence, such
things are in a particular manner brought to pass as we
petitioned for; but we did not expect returns from heaven
in a miraculous and particular manner, and it is a mercy it
is not so.

in the world to have had it so. But the effect upon Will
Atkins is really not to be expressed, and there we may be
sure was no delusion. Sure no man was ever more thank-
ful in the world for anything of its kind than he was for
the Bible—nor, I believe, never any man was glad of a.

perately wicked, yet this man is a standing rule to us all
for the well instructing children—viz., that parents should
never give over to teach and instruct, nor ever despair of
the success of their endeavors, let the children be ever so
refractory, or to appearance insensible to instruction ; for,
if ever God in His providence, touches the conscience of
such, the force of their education returns upon them, and

man; however he was of religion and Christian knowl-
edge, he found he had some to do with now more ignor- '
ant than himself, and that the least part of the instruction
of his good father that now came to his mind was of use
to him
Among the rest, it occurred to him, he said, how his
father used to insist so much on the inexpressible value
of the Bible, and the privilege and blessing of it to nations,
families, and persons; but he never entertained the least
notion of the worth of it till now, when being to talk
to heathens, savages, and barbarians, he wanted the help
of the written oracle for his assistance. The young
woman was glad of it also for the present occasion,
though she had one, and so had the youth, on board our
ship among the goods, which were not yet brought on
shore. And now, having said so many things of this
young woman, I can not omit telling one story of her and
myself, which has something in it very instructive and re-
markable. '
I have related to what extremity the poor young woman
was reduced ; how her mistress was starved to death, and
died on board that unhappy ship we met at sea, and how
the whole ship's company was reduced to the last ex-
tremity. The gentlewoman, and her son, and this maid

neglected and starved—that is to say, brought to the last
extremity of hunger. One day, being discoursing with
her on the extremities they suffered, I asked her if, she
could describe, by what she had felt, what it was to starve,
and how it appeared? She said she believed she could,
and told her tale very distinctly, thus :
“ First, we had for some days fared exceedingly hard,
and suffered very great hunger; but at last we were
wholly witout food of any kind except sugar, and a little

food at all, I found myself, toward evening, empty and
sick at the stomach, and nearer night much inclined to
yawning and sleep. I lay down on the couch in the great
cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, and awakcd r
little refreshed, having taken a glass of wine when I it

then sick again, with retchings to vomit. The second
night, being obliged to go to bed again without any food
more than a draught of fresh water, and being asleep, I
dreamed I was at Barbadoes, and that the market was
mightily stocked with provisions; that‘I bought some for
my mistress, and went and dined heartily. I thought my
stomach was full after this, as it would have been after a
good dinner; but when I awaked I was exceedingly sunk

The last glass of wine we had I drunk, and put sugar in
it, because of its having some spirit to supply nourish-

of the wine was to raise disagreeable fumes from the
stomach into the head; and I lay, as they told me, stupid
and senseless, as one drunk, for some time. The third
day, in the morning, after a night of strange, confused,
and inconsistent dreams, and rather dozing than sleep-
ing, I awaked ravenous and furious with hungerzand
I question, had not my understanding returned and
conquered it, whether if I had been a mother, and
had had a little child with me, its life would have
been safe or not. This lasted about three hours, during
which time I was twice raging mad as any creature in
Bedlam, as my young master told me, and as he can now

down and struck my face against the corner of a pallet-

gushed out of my nose; and the cabin-boy bringing me
a little basin, I sat down and bled into it a great deal; and
as the blood came from me I came to myself, and the

did the ravenous part of the hunger. Then I grew
sick, and retched to vomit, but could not, for I had
nothing in my stomach to bring up. After I had bled
some time I swooned, and they all believed I was
dead; but I came to myself soon after, and then had a
\
"A

most dreadful pain in my stomach not to be described
;not like the colic, but a gnawing, eager pain for
food. I took another draught of water with sugar in it;
but my stomach loathed the sugar and brought it all
up again ; then I took a draught of water without
sugar, and that stayed with me; and I lay me down
upon the bed, praying most' heartily that it would please
God to take me away ; and composing my mind in
hopes of it, I slumbered awhile, and then waking,
thought myself dying, being light with vapors from an
empty stomach. I recommended my soul then to God,
and then earnestly wished that somebody would throw me
into the sea.
“All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I
thought, expiring, but she bore it with much more patience
than I, and gave the last bit of ,bread she had left to
her child, my young master, who would not have taken it
but she obliged him to eat it ; and I believe it sayed his
life. Toward the morning I slept again, and when I
awoke I fell into a violent passion of crying, and after

ous and in a most dreadful condition; and once or twice I
was going to bite my own arm. At last I saw the basin
in which was the blood I had bled at my nose the day be-
fore ; I ran to it, and swallowed it in such haste, and such
a greedy appetite, as if I wondered nobody had taken it
before, and afraid it should be taken from me now. After

draught of water, and was composed and refreshed for
some hours after. This was the fourth day ; and thus I
kept up till toward night, when, within the compass of
three hours, I had all the several circumstances over again,
one after another—viz , sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain
in the stomach, then ravenous again, then sick, then luna-
tic, then crying, then ravenous again, and so every quar-
ter of an hour, and my strength wasted exceedingly; at
night I lay me down, having no comfort but in the hope
that I should die before morning.
“ All this night I had no sleep; but the hunger was now
turned into a disease; and I had a terrible colic and grip-
ing, by wind instead of food having found its way into the
bowels; and in this condition I lay till morning, when I


was surprised by the cries and lamentations of my young
master, who called out to me that his mother was dead. I
lifted myself up a little, for I had strength to rise, but
found she was not dead, though she was able to give very
little signs of life. _ I had then such convulsions in my
stomach, for want of some sustenance, as I can not de-
scribe; with such frequent throes and pangs of appetite as
nothing but the tortures of death can imitate ; and in this
condition I was when I heard the seamen above cry out,
‘A sail! a sail !’ and halloo and jump about as if they
were distracted. I was not able to get off from the bed,
and my mistress much less ; and-my young master was so
sick that I thought he had been expiring; so we could not
open the cabin door, or get any account what it was that
occasioned such confusion; nor had we had any conversa-
tion with the ship’s company for twelve days, they having
told us that they had not a mouthful of anything to eat in
the ship ; and this they told us afterward—they thought
we had been dead. It was this dreadful condition we
were in when you were sent to save our lives ; and how
you found us, sir, you know as well as I, and better too."
This was her own relation, and is such a distinct account
of starving to death, as, I confess, I never met with, and
was exceeding instructive to me. I am the rather apt to
believe it to be a true account, because the youth gave me
an account of a good part of it ; though I must own, not
so distinct and so feeling as the maid ; and the rather, be-
cause it seems his mother fed him at the price of her own
life; but the poor maid, whose constitution was stronger
than that of her mistress, who was in years, and a weakly
woman too, might struggle harder with it; nevertheless,‘;
she might be supposed to feel the extremity something
sooner than her mistress, who might be allowed to keep,—
the last bit something longer than she parted with any to
relieve her maid. No question, as the case is here related
if our ship or some other had not so providentially met
them, but a few days more would have ended all their
lives. I now return to my disposition of things among the

such seeds of division among them that I saw plainly, had.
I set up the sloop, and left it among them, they would,
upon every light disgust, have separated, and gone away
from one another; or perhaps have turned pirates, and so
made the island a den of thieves, instead of a plantation
of sober and religious people, as I intended it ; nor did I
leave the two pieces of brass cannon that I had on board,
or the extra two quarter-deck guns that my nephew had
provided, for the same reason. I thought it was enough
to qualify them for a defensive war against any that
should invade them, but not to set them up for an offen-
sive war, or to go abroad to attack others ; which in the
end, would only bring ruin and destruction upon them. I
reserved the sloop, therefore, and the guns, for their ser-
vice another way, as I shall observe in its place.
Having now done with the island, I left them all in

ticularly promised to send them some cattle, such as sheep,

brought from England, we had been obliged, by the
length of our voyage, to kill them at sea, for want of hay
to feed them. _

ing, we set sail, and arrived at the bay of All Saints in the
Brazils in about twenty-two days, meeting nothing remark~
able in our passage but this : that about three days after
we had sailed, being becalmed, and the current setting
strong to the E. N. E., running, as it were, into a bay or
gulf on the land side, we were driven something out of our
course, and once or twice our men cried out, “ Land to
the eastward ! " but whether it was the continent orislands
we could not tell by any means. But the third day,
toward evening, the sea smooth, and the weather calm, we
saw the sea, as it were, covered toward the land with some
thing very black ; not being able to discover what it was,
till after some time, our chief mate, going up the main-
shrouds, a little way, and looking at them with a perspect-
ive, cried out it was an army. I could not imagine what
he meant by an army, and thwarted him a little hastily.


“ Nay, sir,” says he, “ don’t be angry, for ’tis an army, and

you may see them paddle along, for they are coming toward
us apace.”
I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my
nephew the captain; for he had heard such terrible stories
of them in the island, and having never been in those seas
before, that he could not tell what to think of it, but said,
two or three times, we should all be devoured. I must
confess, considering we were becalmed, and the current
set strong toward the shore, I liked it the worst; however,
I bade them not to be afraid, but bring the ship to an
anchor as soon as we came so near as to know that we
must engage them. The weather continued calm, and
they came on apace toward us, so I gave orders to come
to an anchor, and furl all our sails ; as for the savages, I

close by the head and the other by the stern, and

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while
they came up with us ; but never was such a horrid sight
seen by Christians ; though my mate was much mistaken
in his calculation of their number, yet when they came up
we reckoned about a hundred and twenty-six canoes;
some of them had sixteen or seventeen men in them, and
some more, and the least six or seven. When they came
nearer to us, they seemed to be struck with wonder and

presently set up a kind of fence, like waste boards, to
cover them from the arrows of the savages, if they should
shoot again. ‘
About half an hour afterward they all came up in a
body astern of us, and so near that we could easily discern
what they were, though we could not tell their design ;
and I easily found the were some of my old friends, the
same sort of savages t at I had been used to engage with.
In a short time more they rowed a little further out to sea,
till they came directly broadside with us, and then rowed
dOWn straight upon us, till they came so near that they
could hear us speak ; upon this, I ordered all my men to
keep close, lestt ey should shoot anymore arrows, and made
all our guns ready ; but being so near as to be within hear-
ing, I made Friday go out upon the deck, and call out
aloud to them in his language, to know what they meant.
Whether they understood him or not, that I knew not; but
as soon as he had called to them, six of them, who were
- in the foremost or nighest boat to us, turned their canoes
from us, and stooping down, ShOWed us their naked backs;

that three or four of their canoes Were overset, as we had
reason to believe, by one shot only. The ill manners of

but when they shot at us directly with all the fury they
were capable of, and especially as they had killed my
poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved and valued, and
who, indeed, so well deserved it, I thought myself not
406 ROBINSON CRUSOE.
very glad if I could have overset every canoe there, and
drowned every one of them.
I can neither tell how many we killed nor how many we
wounded at this broadside, but sure such a fright and
hurry never were seen among such a multitude ; there
were thirteen or fourteen of their canoes split and overset
in all, and the men all set a-swimming: the rest, frightened
out of their wits, scoured away as fast as they could, tak-
ing but little care to save those whose boats were split or
spoiled with our shot; so I suppose that many of them
were lost; and our men took up one poor fellow swimming
for his life, above an hour after they were all gone. The
small shot from our cannon must needs kill and wound a
great many; but, in short, we never knew how it went with

abouts we could not see above three or four straggling
canoes, nor did we ever see the rest any more ; for a
breeze of wind springing up the same evening, we weighed
and set sail for the Brazils.
We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was so sul-
len that he would neither eat nor speak, and we all fancied
he would starve himself to death. But I took a way to
cure him: for I had made them take him and turn him in-
to the long-boat, and make him believe they would toss
him into the sea again, and so leave him where they found
him, if he would not speak ; nor would that do, but they
really did throw him into the sea, and came away from
him. Then he followed them, for he swam like a 005k,
and called to them in his tongue, though they knew not
one word of what he said ; however, at last they took him
in again, and then he began to be more tractable: nor did
I ever design they should drown him.
We were now under sail again, but I was the most dis-
consolate creature alive for want of my man Friday, and
wOuld have been very glad to have gone back to the island
to have taken one of the rest from thence for my occasion
but it could not be: so we went on. We had one prisoner,
as I have said, and it was a long time before we could
make him understand anything, but, in time, our men
taught him some English, and he began to be a little
tractable. Afterward, we inquired what country he came
from; but could make nothing of what he said; for his
speech was so odd, all gutturals, and he spoke in the
throat in such a hollow, odd manner that we could never
form a. word after him;and we were all of the opinion
that they might speak that language as well if they were
gagged as otherwise; nor could we perceive that they had
any occasion either for teeth, tongue, lips, or palate, but
formed their words just as a hunting-horn forms a tune,
with an open throat. He told us, however, some time after,

come up to us. He said, “ To makee te great wonder

also those of Africa, when they learn English, always add
two e's at the end of words where we use one; and they
place the accent upon them, as makée, takée, and the like;
nay, I could hardly make Friday leave it off, though at
last he did.
And now I name the poor fellow'once more, I must take
my last leave of him. Poor honest Friday! We buried
him with all the decency and solemnity possible, by put-

ROBINSON CRUSOE. - 409
me there was a certain very honest fellow, a Brazil planter
of his acquaintance, who had fallen into the displeasure of
the church. “ I know not what the matter is with him,"
says he, “ but, on my conscience, I think he is a heretic in
his heart, and he has been obliged to conceal himself for
fear of the Inquisition.” He then told me that he would
be very glad of such an opportunity to make his escape,
with his wife and two daughters ; and if I would let them
go to my island, and allot them a plantation, he
would give them a small stock to begin with—for the

estate, and he had nothing left but a little household stuff
and two slaves ; "and," adds he, “ though I hate his
principles, yet I would not have him fall into their hands,
for he will be assuredly burned alive if he does." I
granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with
them: and we concealed the man, and his wife and daugh-
ters, on board our ship, till the sloop put out to go to sea;
and then having put all their goods on board some time
before, we put them on board the sloop after she was get
out of the bay. Our seaman Was mightily pleased with
this new partner ; and their stocks, indeed, were much
alike, rich in tools, in preparations, and a farm—but noth-
ing to begin with, except as above: however, they carried
over with them what was worth all the rest, some materi-
als for planting sugar-canes, with some plants of canes,
which he, I mean the Brazil planter, understood very well.
Among the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants in
the island, I sent them by the sloop three milch coWs and

sows, two mares, and a stone-horse. For my Spaniards
according to my promise, I engaged three Brazil Women
to go, and recommended it to them to marry them, and
use them kindly. .I could have procured more women,
but I remembered that the poor persecuted man had two

though in another country. All this cargo arrived safely,
and, as you may easily suppose, was very welcome to my
old inhabitants, who were now, with this addition, between
sixty and seventy people, besides little children, of which
there were a great many. I found letters at London from
them all, by the way of Lisbon, when I came back to
England.
I have now done with the island, and all manner of
discourse about it : and whoever reads the rest of my
memorandums would do well to turn his thoughts entirely
from it, and expect to read of the follies of an /old man,

men, to beware; not cooled by almost forty years’ miseries

I HAD no, more business to go to the East Indies than a

and desire him to lock him up among the prisoners there,
and starve him. Had I taken a small vessel from Eng-
land and gone directly to the island ; had I loaded her, as
I did the other vessel, with all the necessaries for the
plantation, and for my people; taken a patent from the

stayed there myself, I had at least acted like a man of
common sense. But I was possessed of a wandering spirit
and scorned all advantages: I pleased myself with being
the patron of the people I placed there, and doing for
them in a kind ofhaughty, majestic way, like an old patri-
archal monarch, providing for them as if I had been father
of the whole family,as well as of the plantation. But I
never so much as pretended 'to plant in the name of any
government or nation, or to acknowledge any prince, or to
call my people subjects to any one nation more than an-
other: nay,‘ I never so much as gave the place a name, but
left it as I found it, belonging to nobody, and the people

or other, further than .voluntary consen ' moved them to'
comply. Yet even this, had I stayed there, would have done
well enough; but as I rambled from them, and came there no
more, the last letters I had from any of them were by my
partner’s means, who afterward sent another sloop to the
place, and who sent me word, though I had not the letter
till I got to London, several years after it was written, that
they went on but poorly, were discontented with their long

Spaniards were come away ; and though they had not been
much molested by the savages, yet they had had some
skirmishes with them; and that they begged of him to
write to me to think of the promise I had made to fetch
them away, that they might see their country again before
they died.
But I was gone on a wild-goose chase, indeed! and
they that will have any more of me must be content to

wild adventures, wherein the justice of Providence

ish us most severely with those very things which we
think it would be our utmost happiness to be allowed
to possess. ' Whether I had business or no business,
away I went ; it is no time now to allow to enlarge upon
the reason or absurdity of my own conduct, but to come
to the history—I was embarked for the voyage, and the
voyage I went.
I shall only add a Word or two concerning my honest
Popish clergyman—for let their opinion of us, and all
other heretics in general, as they call us, be as uncharitable
as it may, I verily-believe this man was very sincere,
and wished the good of all men : yet I believe he used
reserve in many of his expressions, to prevent giving me '
offense; for I scarce heard him once call on the Bles-
sed Virgin, or mention St. ]ago, or his guardian angel,
though so common with the rest of them. However, I
say I had not the least doubt of his sincerity and pious

to visit even the poor Tartars and Laplanders,lwhere they
have nothing to give them, as well as covet'to flock to
India, Persia, China, etc., the most wealthy of the heathen
countries ; for if they expected to bring no gains to their
church by it, it may well be admired how they came to
admit the Chinese Confucius into the calendar of the
Christian saints. .
A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon, my pious priest
asked me leave to go thither; being still, as he observed,
41 2 ROBINSON CRUSOE,
it had been for me if I had gone with him. But it was
too late now; all things Heaven appoints for the best; had
I gone with him I had never had so many things to
be thankful for, and the reader had never heard of the
second part of the travels and adventures of Robinson
Crusoe : so I must here leave exclaiming at myself,
and go on with my voyage. From the Brazils we made
directly over the Atlantic Sea to the Cape of Good Hope,
and had a tolerably good voyage, our course generally
south-east, now and then a storm, and some contrary
winds; but my‘disasters at sea were at an end—my future
rubs and cross events were to to befall me on shore, that
it might appear the land was as well' prepared to be our
scourge as the sea.
Our shin was on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo
on board, who was to direct all her motions after she
arrived at the Cape, only being limited to a certain num-
ber of days for stay, by charter-party, at the several ports
she was to go to. This was none of my business, neither
did I meddle with it ; my nephew, the captain, and the
supercargo'adjusting all those thing between them as they

knew we were at war with France, I had some apprehen-
sions of them ; but they went their own way, and we heard
no more of them.
I shall not pester the reader with a tedious description
of places. journals of our voyage, variations of the compass,
latitudes, trade-winds, etc.; it is enough to name the ports
and places which we touched at, and what occurred to us

and bows, which they use with inconceivable dexterity, yet
we fared very well with them awhile. They treated us

such as knives, scissors, etc., they brought us eleven good
fat bullocks, of a middling size, which we took in, partly
for fresh provisions for our present spending, and the rest
to salt for the ship‘s use. .
We were obliged to stay here some time after we had
furnished ourselves with provisions ; and I, who was
always too curious to look into every nook of the world
wherever I came, went on shore as often as I could. It
was on the east side of the island that we went on shore
one evening; and the people, who, by the way, are very
numerous, came thronging about us, and stood gazing at
us at a distance. As we had traded freely with them, and
had been kindly used, we thought ourselves in no danger;
but when we saw the people, we out three boughs out of
a tree, and stuck them up at a distance from us ; which it
seems, is a mark in that country not only of a truce and
friendship, but when it is accepted the other side set up
three poles or boughs, which is a signal that they accept
the truce too ; but then this is a known condition of the
truce, that you are not to pass beyond their three poles
toward them, nor they to come past your three poles
toward you ; so that you are perfectly 'secure within the
three poles, and all the space between your poles and

It happened one evening, when we went on shore, that
a greater number ofytheir people came down than usual,

toys as we had; the women also brought us milk and roots,
and several things very acceptable to us, and all was
quiet ; and we made us a little tent or but of some
boughs or trees, and lay on shore all night. I know not

lie on shore as the rest ; and the boat riding at an anchor
at about a stone’s cast from the land, with two men in her
to take care of her, I made one of them come on shore ;
and getting some boughs of_ trees to cover us also in the
boat, I spread the sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay
under the cover of the branches of the trees all night in
the boat.
About two o’clock in the morning we heard one of our
men making a terrible noise on the shore, calling out, for
God’s sake to bring the boat in, and come and help them,
for they were all like to be murdered ; at the same time I

guns they had, and that three times over; for it seems the
natives here were not so easily frightened with guns as the
savages were in America, where I had to do with them.
All this while I knew not what was the matter, but rous-
ing immediately from sleep with the noise, I caused the
boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with three fusees we had
on board, to land and assist our men. We got the boat
soon to ,the shore, but our men were in too much haste ;
for being come to the shore, they plunged into the water,
to get to the boat with all the expedition they could, being
pursued by between three and four hundred men. Our

enough too, three of them being very ill wounded; and


that which was still worse was, that while we stood in the
boat to take our men in, we were in as much danger as
they were in on shore; for they poured their arrows in
upon us so thick that we were glad to barricade the side of
the boat up with the branches, and two or three loose
boards, which, to our great satisfaction, we had by mere
accident in the boat. And yet, had it been daylight, they
are, it seems, such exact marksmen, that if they could
have seen but the least part of any of us, they would have
been sure of us. We had, by the light of the moon, a
little sight of them, as they stood pelting us from the shore

we gave them a volley, that we could hear, by the cries of
some of them, had wounded several; however, they stood
thus in battle array on the shore till break of day, which
we supposed was that they might see the better to take
their aim at us.
In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh
our anchor, or set up our sail, because we must needs stand
up in the boat, and they were as sure to hit us as we were
to hit a bird in a tree with small shot. We made signals
of distress to the ship, and though she rode a league off,

toward the shore, pretty well understood us; and weighing
anchor with all speed, he stood as near the shore as he
durst-with the ship, and then sent another boat, with ten
hands' in her, to assist us. We called to them not to come
too near, telling them what condition we were in; however,
they stood in near to us, and one of the men taking the
end of a tow-line in his hand, and keeping me boat be-
tween him and the enemy, so that they could not perfectly
see him, swam on board us, and made fast the line to the
boat: upon which we slipped out a little cable, and leaving
our anchor behind, they towed us out of reach of the
arrows ; we all the while lying close behind the barricade
we had made. As soon as we were got from between the
ship and shore, that we could lay her side to the shore,
she ran along just by them, and poured in a broadside
among them, loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small
bullets, and such stuff, besides the great shot, which‘made
a terrible havoc among them.
When we were got on board, and out of danger, we had
in.
time to eXamine into the occasion of this fray; and, indeed,
our supercargo, who had been often in those parts, put me
upon it; for he said'he was sure the inhabitants would not
have touched us after we had made a truce, if we had not
done something to provoke them to it. At length it came
out that an old woman, who had come to sell us some
milk, had brought it within our poles, and ayoung woman
with her, who also brought some roots or herbs; and while
the old woman (whether she was mother to the young .
woman or no they could not tell) was selling us the milk,
one of our men offered some rudeness to the girl that was
with her, at which the old woman made a great noise:
however, the seaman would not quit his prize, but carried
her out of the old woman's sight among the trees, it being
almost dark ; the old woman went away without her, and,
as we may suppose, made an outcry among the people she
came from; who, upon notice, raised that great army upon ,
us in three or four hours, and it was great odds but we
had all been destroyed. _
One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him
just at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the
tent they had made; the rest came off free, all but the
fellow who was the occasion of all the mischief, who paid
dear enough for his brutality, for we could not hear what
became of him for a great while. We lay upon the shore
two days after, though the wind presented, and made sig-
nals for him, and made our boat sail up shore and down
shore several leagues, but in vain ; so we were obliged to
give him over; and if he alone had suffered for it, the loss
had been less. I could not satisfy myself, however, with-
out venturing on shore once more, to try if I could learn
anything of him or them ; it was the third night after the
action that I had a great mind to learn, if I could by any
means, what mischief we had done, and how the game
stood on the Indians’ side. I was careful to do it in the
dark, lest we should be attacked again: but I ought, in-
deed, to have been sure that the men I went with had been
under my command, before I engaged ,in a thing so
hazardous and mischievous as I was brought into by it,
without design.
We took twenty as stout fellows with us as any in the
Shlp, besides the supercargo and myself, and we landed
two hours before midnight, at the same place where the

marks behind them of the mischief we had done them,
and I thought if we could surprise one or two of them,
perhaps we might get our man again, by way of exchange.
We landed without any noise, and divided our men into
two bodies, whereof the boatswain commanded one and I
the other. We neither saw nor heard anybody stir when
we landed : and we marched up, one body at a distance r

made them halt awhile; for knowing by the circumstances
that they were at the place where the Indians had stood,
they waited for my coming up there. We concluded to
halt till the moon began to rise, which we knew would be
in less than an hour, when we could easily discern the
havoc we had made among them. We told thirty-two
bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not quite dead;
some had an arm, and some a leg shot off, and one his
head ; those that were wounded, we supposed, they had
carried away. When we had made, as I thought, a full
discovery of all we could come to the knowledge of, I re-
solved on going on board ; but the boatswain and his
party sent me word that they were resolved. to make a
visit to the Indian town, where these dogs, as they called
_them, dwelled, and asked me to go along with them ; and

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well
enough what answer to have given them; for I should
have commanded them instantly on board, knowing it was

loading in our charge, and a voyage to make which de-
pended very much upon the lives of the men ; but as they
sent me word they were resolved to go, and only asked
me and my company to go along with them, I positively
refused it, and rose up, for I was sitting on the ground, in
order to go to the boat. One or two of the men began to
importune me to go; and when I refused, began to grumble,
and say they were not under my command, and they
would go. “ Come, Jack,” says one of the men, “ will you
go with me? I’ll go for one." Jack said he would—land
then another—and, in a word, they all left me but one,
whom I persuaded to stay, and a boy left in the boat.
So the supercargo and I, with the hired man, went back
to the boar, where we told them we would stay for them,
and take care to take in as many of them as should be
left; for I told them it was a mad thing, they were going
about, and supposed most of them would have the fate
of Tom Jeffry. ‘
They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they
would come off again, and they would take care, etc; so
away they went. I entreated them to consider the ship
and the voyage, that their lives were \not their own, and
that they were intrusted with the voyage, in some meas-
ure; that if they miscarried, the ship might be lost for
want of their help, and that they could not answer for it
to God or man. But I might as well have talked to the
mainmast of the ship: they were mad upon their journey;
only they gave .me good words, and begged I would not
be angry; that they did not doubt but they would be back
again in about an hour at furthest; for the Indian town,
they said, was not above half a mile off, though they found
it above two miles before they got to it.
Well, they all went away, and though the attempt was
desperate, and such as none but madmen would have gone
about, yet, to give them_their due, they went about it as
warily as boldly; they were gallantly armed, for they had
every man a fuse or musket,a bayonet, and a pistol; some
of them had broad cutlasses, some of them had hangers,
and the boatswain and two more had pole-axes; besides
all which they had among them thirteen hand grenadoes.
Bolder fellows, and better provided, never went about
any wicked work in the world. When they went out their
chief design was plunder, and they were in mighty hopes

made devils of them all. ,
When they came to the few Indian houses which they
thought had been the town, which was not above half a
mile off, they were under great disappointment, for there
were not above twelve or thirteen houses, and where the
town was, or how big. they knew not. They consulted,
therefore, what to do, and were some time before they
could resolve; for if they fell upon these, they must cut
all their throats; and it was ten to one but some of them
might escape, it being in the night; though the moon was
up; and if‘ one escaped he would'run and raise all the
'town, so they should have a whole army upon them; on
the other hand, if they went away and left those un-
touched, for the people were all asleep, they could not tell
which way to look for the town: however the last was the
best advice, so they resolved to leave them, and look for
the town as well as they could. They went on a little
way, and found a cow tied to a tree; this, they presently
concluded, would be a good guide to them; for, they said,
the cow certainly belonged to the town before them, or the
town behind them, and if they untied her, they could see
which way she went; if she went back, they had nothing
tp say to her;'but if she went forward, they would follow
\her. 'So they cut the cord, which was made of twisted

They did so, and desperately resolved that they would

another to the work, three of them, who were a little
before the rest, called out aloud to them, and told them
that they had found Tom Jeffry: they all ran up to the
place, where they found the poor fellow hanging up naked
by one arm, and his throat cut. There was an Indian
house just by the tree, where they found sixteen or seven-

thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and the
supercargo, what would become of us; and at last, though
he could ill spare any more men, yet not knowing what
exigence we might be in, he took another boat, and with
thirteen men and himself came ashore to me.
He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the
boat with no more than two men; and though he was glad
that we were well, yet he was in the same impatience with
us to know what was doing; for the noise continued; and

to know what had- happened, or their concern for the
safety of the men; in a word, the captain told me he
would go and help his men, let what would come. I
argued with him, as I did before with the men, the 'safety
of the ship, the danger of the Voyage, the interest of the
owners and merchants, etc.. and told him I and the two
men would go, and only see if we could at a distance learn
what was likely to be the event, and come back and tell
him. It was in vain to talk to my nephew, as it Was to
talk to the rest before ; he wonld go it, he said ; and he

back, six men should keep the two boats, and six more
come after us; so that he left only sixteen men in the ship;

of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda, in Ireland, and kill-

Tilly sacking the city of Magdeburg and cutting the throats
of twenty-two thousand of all sexes ; but I never had an

would; accordingly, as I came back to my men, I told
them my resolution, and commanded them to follow me,
when, at the very moment, came four of our men, with
the boatswain at their head, roving over heaps of bodies
they had killed, all covered with blood and dust, as if they
wanted more people to massacre, when our men hallooed
to them as loud as they could halloo ; and with
much ado one of them made them hear, so that they
knew Who we were, and came up to .us.
As soon as the boatswain saw us he set up a halloolike
a shout of triumph, for having, as he thought, more help
come ; and, without waiting to hear me, “ Captain,” says
he, “ noblelcaptain ! I am glad you are come, we have not
half done yet. Villainous, hell-hound dogs ! I’ll kill as
many of them as poor Tom has hairs upon his head : we
have sworn to spare none of them; we’ll rodt out the very
nation of them from the earth ;” and thus he ran on, out
_of breath, too, with action, and would not give us leave to
speak a word. At last, raising my voice, that I might
silence him a little, “ Barbarous dog ! ” said I, “ what are
you doing P I won’t have one creature touched more,
upon pain of death ; I charge you, upon your life, to stop
your hands, and stand still here, or you are a dead
man this minute." “ Why, sir," says he, “ do you
know what you do, or what they have done? If you
want a reason for what we have done, corne hither ; ” and
with that he showed me the poor fellow hanging with his
throat cut.
I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time
would have been forward enough; but I thought they had
carried their rage too far, and remembered jacob's words
to his sons Simeon and Levi : “ Cursed be their anger, for

had now a new task upon my hands ; for when the men I
carried with me saw the sight, as I had done, I had as
much to do to restrain them as I should have done with
the others ; nay, my nephew himself fell in with them, and
told me, in their hearing, that he was only concerned for
fear of the men being overpowered ; and as to the peo-
ple, he thought not one of them ought to liVe ; for they
had all glutted themselves with the murder of the poor
'man, and that they ought to be used like murderers. Upon
these words, aWay ran eight of my men, with the boatsWain
and his crew, to complete their bloody work ; and I, see-
ing it quite out of my power to restrain them, came away
pensive and sad ; for I could not bear the sight, much less
the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell
into their hands. ‘
I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo
and two men, and with these walked back to the boat. It

rectly to the sea side, and by the time I got to the sea-side

I was very angry with my nephew, fhe captain, and,
indeed, with all the men, but with him in particular, as
well for,his acting so out of his duty, as commander of
the ship, and having the charge of the voyage upon him,
as in his prompting, rather than cooling, the rage of his
blind men in so bloody and cruel an enterprise. My nephal
ew answered me very respectfully, and told me that when
he saw the body of the poor seaman whom they had mur-
dered in so cruel and barbarous a manner he was not
master of himself, neither could he govern his passion;
he owned he should not have done so, as he was com-
mander of the ship; but as he was a man, and nature
moved him, he could not bear it. As for the rest of the
men, they were not subject to me at all, and they knew it
well enough; so they took no notice of my dislike. The
next day we set sail, so we never heard any more of it.
Our men differed in the account of the number of men
they had killed; but,according to the best of their ac-
counts, all put 'together, they killed or destroyed about
426 ' \ ROBINSON cavsol.
and left not a house standing in the town. ' As for the
poor fellow Tom Jeffry, he was quite dead (for his th oat
was so cut that his head was half off), it would do hi no
service to bring him away; so they only took him down
from the tree, where he was hanging by one hand.
However just our men thought this action, I was against
them in it, and I always, after that time, told them God
would blast the voyage; for I looked upon all the blood
they shed that night to be murder in them. For though
it is true that they had killed Tom Jeffry, yet Jeffry was
the aggressor, had broken the truce, and had ill-used a
young woman of theirs, who came down to them inno-
cently, and on the faith of the public capitulation.
The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were
' afterwards on board. He said it was true that we seemed
to break the truce, but really did not; and that the war
was begun the night before by the natives themselves,
who had shot at us, and killed one of our men without
any just provocation; so that as we were in a capacity to
426 ' \ ROBINSON cavsol.
selves justice upon them in an extraordinary manner; that
though the poor man had taken a little liberty with the
girl, he ought not to have been murdered, and that in
such a villianous manner; and that they did nothing but
\

what was just and what the laws of God allowed to be
done to murderers. One would think this should have
been enough to have warned us against going on shore
among heathens and barbarians, but it is impossible to
make mankind wise but at their own expense, and their
experience seems to be always of most use to them when
it is dearest bought.
We were now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and from
thence to the coast of Coromandel, only to touch at Surat;
but the chief of the supercargo's design lay at the Bay of
, Bengal; where, if he missed his business outward bound,
he was to go out to China, and return to the coast as he

on the Arabian side of the gulf, were surrounded by the
Arabians, and either all killed orcarried away into slavery;
the rest of the boat's crew were not able to rescue them;
and had but just time to get off their boat. I began to
upbraid them with the just retribution of Heaven in this
case; but the boatswain very warmly told me, he thought
I went further in my censures than I could show any war-
rant for in Scripture; and referred to Luke xiii, 4, where
our Saviour intimates that those men on whom the Tower
of Siloam fell were not sinners above all the Galileans; but

called it, though our men could not bear to hear the word

' But my _frequent preaching to them on this subject had
worse consequences than I expected; and the boatswain,

me one time, and told me he found that I brought that

account, and himself in particular; that as I was but a
passenger, and had no command in the ship, or concern
in the voyage, they were not obliged to bear it; that they
did not know but I might have some ill design in my
head, and perhaps to call them to an account for it when
they came to England; and that therefore, unless I would
resolve to have done with it, and also not to concern my-
self any further with him, or any of his affairs, he would
leave the ship; for he did not think it safe to sail with me
among them.
I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and
then told him that I confessed I had all along opposed
the massacre of Madagascar, and that I had, on all occa-
sions, spoken my mind freely about it, though not more
upon him than any of the rest; that as to having’no com-
mand in the ship, that was true; nor did I exercise any
authority, only took the liberty of speaking my mind in
things which publicly concerned us all; and what concern
I had in the voyage was none of his business; that I was
aconsiderable owner in the ship. In that claim I con-
ceived I had a right to speak even further than I had
done, and would not be accountable to him or any one
else, and began to be a little warm with him. He made
but little reply to me at that time, and I thought the
affair had been over. We were at this time in the road
at Bengal; and being willirg to seethe place, I went on
shore with the supercargo in the ship's boat to divert my-
self; and toward evening was preparing to go on board,
when one of the men came to me, and told me he would
not have me troubl; myself to come down to the boat,
for they had orders not to carry me on board any more.
Any one may guess what a surprise I was in at so inso-
lent a message; and I asked the man who bade him
deliver that message to me. He told me the cockswain.
I immediately found out the supercargo, and told him
the story, adding that I foresaw there would be a mutiny
in the ship; and entreated him to go immediately on board
and acquaint the captain of it. But I might have spared
this intelligence, for before I had spoken to him on shore
the matter was effected on board. The boatswain, the
428 ROBINSON causes.
as I was gone off in the boat, came up, and desired to
speak with the captain; and then the boatswain, making a
long harangue, and repeating all he had said to me, told
the captain that as I was now gone peaceably on shore,
they were loath to use any violence with me, which, if I
had not gone on shore, they would otherwise have done,

to tell him that as they shipped themselves to serve in the
ship under his command, they would perform it well and
faithfully; but if I would not quit the ship, or the captain
oblige me to quit it, they would all leave the ship, and
sail no further with him; and at that word all he turned
his face toward the mainmast, which was, it seems, a
signal agreed on, when the seamen, being got together
there, cried out, “ One and all! one and all!”
My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of
great presence of mind; and though he was surprised, yet
he told them calmly that he would consider of the matter;
but that he could do nothing in it till _he had spoken to
me about it. He used some arguments with them, to
show them the unreasouableness and injustice of the thing
—but it was all in vain; they swore, and shook hands
round before his face, that they would all go on shore
unless he would engage to them not to suffer me to come
any more on board the ship. ,
This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obliga-
tion to me, and did not know how I might take it. So he
began to talk smartly to them; told them that I was a
very considerable owner of the ship, and that if ever they
came to England again it would cost them very dear; that
the ship was mine, and that he could not put me out of
it; and that he would rather lose the ship, and the voyage
too, than disoblige me so much; so they might do as they
pleased. However, he would go on shore and talk with
me, and invited the boatswain to go with-him, and per-
haps they might accommodate the matter with me. But
they all rejected the proposal, and said they would have
nothing to do with me any more; and if I came on board
they Would all go on shore. “Well,” said the captain,
“ if you are all of this mind, let me go on shore and talk
with him.” So away he came to me with this account, a
little after the message had been brought to me from the
,cockswain. '

then I had been stripped naked in a remote country, hav-
ing nothing to help myself; in short, I had been in a worse
case than when I was alone in the island. But they had
not come to that length, it seems, to my satisfaction; and
when my nephew told me what they had said to him, and
how they had sworn and shook hands that they would,
one and all, leave the ship if I was suffered to come on
board; I told him he should not be concerned at it at all,
for I would stay on shore. I only desired he would take
care and send me all my necessary things on shore, and

ed to their importunity, and had sent for his goods on
board the ship, so that the matter was over in a few hours,
the men returned to their duty, and I began to consider
what course I should steer.
I was now alone in a most remote part of the world,
for I was nearly three thousand leagues by sea further off
from England than I was at my island; only, it is true, I
might travel here by land over the Great Mogul’s country
to Surat, might go from thence to Bassora by sea, up the
Gulf of Persia, and take the way of the caravans, over
the desert of Arabia to Aleppo and Scanderoon; from
thence by sea again to Italy, and so overland into France.
I had another way before me, which was to wait for some
English ships, which were coming to Bengal from Achin,
on the island of Sumatra, and get passage on board them
for England. But as I came hither without any concern

to the purser, whom he engaged to go with me, and the
other was his own servant. Then I took a good lodging
in the house of an English woman, where-several mer-
chants lodged, some French, two Italians, or rather Jews,
and one Englishman. Here I stayed about nine months,
considering what course to take. I had some English
goods with me of value, and a considerable sum of money;
my nephew furnishing-me with a thousand pieces of eight,
and a letter of credit for more, if I had occasion, that I
might not be straitened, whatever might happen. I quick-
ly disposed of my goods to.advantage; and, as I origin-
ally intended, I bought here some very good diamonds,

which, of all other things, were the most proper for me
in my present circumstances, because I could always
carry my whole estate with me. \
During my stay here many proposals were made for my
return to England, but none falling out to my mind, the
English merchant who lodged with me, and whom I had
contracted an intimate acquaintance with, came to me one
morning saying: “Countryman, I have a project to com-
municate, which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, for
aught I know, suit with yours also, when you shall have
thoroughly considered it. Here we are posted, you by
accident and I by my own choice, in a part of the world
very remote from our own country; but it is a country
where, by us who understand trade and business, a great
deal of money is to be got. If you will put one thousand
pounds to one thousand pounds, we will hire a ship here,

I’ll be merchant, and we'll go a trading voyage to China;

I liked this proposal very well; and the more so because
it seemed to be expressed with such good will. In my

a proposal for trade, or indeed anything else. I might
perhaps say with some truth, that if trade was not my ele-
ment, rambling was; and no proposal for seeing any part
of the world which I had never seen before could possibly
come amiss to me. It was, however, some time before
we could get a ship to our minds, and when we had got a
vessel, it was not easy to get English sailors—that is to
say, so many as were necessary to govern the voyage and
manage the sailors which we should pick up there. After
some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a gunner,
English ; a Dutch carpenter, and three foremast' men.
With these we found e could do well enough, having
Indian seamen, such as they were, to make up.

of Sumatra, and from thence to Siam, where we exchanged

the Company send into India, and the merchants which
generally stay there, get such very great estates as they do,
and sometime comes home worth sixty or seventy thousand
pounds at a time; but it is little matter for wonder when we
consider the innumerable ports and places where they have
a free commerce; indeed, at the ports where the English
ships come there is such great and constant demands for
'the growth of all other countries, that there is a certain
vent for the returns, as well as a market abroad for the

an insight into the method of getting more, that had I
been twenty years younger, I should have been tempted
to have stayed here, and sought no further for making
any fortune ; but what was all this to a man upward of
threescore, that was rich enough, and came abroad more
in obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world than
a covetous desire of gaining by it? A restless desire it
really was, for when I was at home I was restless to go
abroad ; and when I was abroad I was restless to be at
home. I say, what was this gain to me? I was rich
enough already, nor had I any uneasy desires about get-

further undertakings. Hence, I thought that by this

thought I might say I had seen all the world that was worth

But my fellow-traveler and I had different notions ; I
acknowledge his were the more suited to the end of a
merchant’s life ; who, when he is abroad upon adventures,
is wise to stick to,that, as the best thing for him, which he __
is likely to get the most money by. On the other hand,
mine was the notion of a mad, rambling boy, that never
cares to see a thing twice over. But this was not all ; I
\had a kind of impatience upon me tobe nearer home, and


yet an unsettled resolution which way to go. In the in-
terval of these consultations, my friend, who was always
upon the search for business, proposed another voyage
among the Spice Islands, to bring home a loading of
cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts.
We were not long in preparing forthis voyage; the chief

account, smiled at me : “ Well, now," said he,~with a sort

Our Escape. "
A LITTLE while after this there came in a Dutch ship
from Batavia; she was a coaster, not an European trader,
of about two hundred tons burden; the men, as they pre-
tended. having been so sickly that the captain had not
hands enough to go to sea with, so he lay by at Bengal;
and having, it seems, got money enough, or being Willing,
for other reasons, to go for Europe, he gave public notice
he would sell his ship. This came to my ears before my
new partner heard of it, and I had a great mind to buy it;
so I went to him and told him 0 it. He considered
awhile, for he was no rash man neit er; and at last re-
e
plied, “ She is a little too big; however, we will have
her." Accordingly, we bought the ship, and agreeing
with the master, we paid for her, and took possession.
When we had done so we resolved to engage the men, if
we could, to join with those we had, 'for the pursuing our
business; but, on a sudden, they having received not their
wages, ‘but their share of the money, as we afterward
learned, not one of them was to be found; we inquired
much about them, and at length were told that they were
all gone together by land to Agra, the great city of the
Mogul’s residence, to proceed from thence to Surat, and
then go by sea to the Gulf of Persia. ‘
Nothing had so much troubled me a good while as that
I should miss the opportunity of going with them; for such
a ramble, I thought, and in such company as would both
have guarded and diverted me, would have suited mightily
with my great design; and I should have both seen the
world and gone homeward too. But I was much better

of fellows they were; for, in short, their history was that
this man they called captain was the gunner only, not the
' commander; that they had been atrading voyage, in which
they had been attacked on shore by some of the Malays,
who had killed the captain and three of his men; and that
after the captain was killed, these men, eleven in number,
having resolved to run away with the ship, brought her to
434 ROBINSON CRUSOE.
Well, let them get the ship how they would, we came
honestly by her, as we thought, though we did not, 1 con-
fess, examine into things so exactly as we ought; for we
never inquired anything of the seamen, who would cer-
tainly have faltered in their account, and contradicted one
another. Somehow or Other we should have had reason to
have suspected them; but the man showed us a bill of sale
for the ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such
name, for I suppose it was all a forgery, and called him-
self by that name, and we could not contradict him; and
withal, having no suspicion of the thing, we went through
with our bargain. We picked up some more English
sailors here after this, and some Dutch, and now we re-
solved on a second voyage to the south-east for cloves, etc.

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat
up and down a great while in the Straits of Malacca and
among the islands, we were no sooner got clear of those

but could not discover where it was. This forced us to
inake seme port; and my partner, who knew the country
better than I did, directed the captain to put into the river
of Cambodia; for I had made the English mate, one Mr.
Thompson, captain, not being willing to take the charge
of the ship upon myself. This river lies on the north side
of the great bay or gulf which goes up to Siam. While we
were here, and going often on shore for refreshment, there
comes to me one day an Englishman, a gunner's mate on
board an English East India ship, then riding in the same
river. “ Sir,” says he, addressing me, “ you are a
stranger to me, and I to you; but I have something to tell
you that very nearly concerns you. I am moved by the
imminent danger you are in, and, for aught I see, you
have no knowledge of it.” “ I know no danger I am in.”

able to deal with them? I suppose you do not think you
are a match for them? I could not conceive what he
meant; and I turned short upon him, and said : “I wish
you would explain yourself ; I can not imagine what rea-
son I have to be afraid of any of the Company’s ships, or
Dutch ships. I am no interloper. What can they have

hanged fora pirate, and the particulars be examined after-

with a better reception than this for doing you a piece of
service of such importance.” “ I can never be ungrateful,"
said I, “ for any service, or to any man that offers me any
kindness ; but it ' is past my comprehension what they
should have such a design upon me for ; however, since\
you say there is no time to be lost, and' that there is some

which I suppose you know well enough—that you were
with this ship at Sumatra ; that there your captain was
murdered by the Malays, with three of his men ; and that
you, or some of those that were on board with you, ran
away with the ship, and are since tufned pirates. This is
the sum of the story, and you will all be seized as pirates,
I can assure you, and executed with very little ceremony;
for you know merchant ships show but little law to pirates
if they can get them into their power." “ Now you speak
plain English,” said I, “ and I thank you ; and though I
know nothing that we have done like what you talk of, for
I am sure we came honestly and fairly by the ship ; yet
seeing such a work is doing, as you say, and that you seem
to mean honestly, I will be upon my guard.” “ Nay, sir,”
says he, “ do not talk of being upon your guard ; the best
defense is to be out of danger. If you have any regard
for your life and the lives of all your men, put to sea with-

length of the way ; besides, as they are. only boats, and
not ships, they will not venture to follow you far out to

been very kind in this; what shall I do to make you

make me any amends, because you may not be convinced
of the truth of it. I Will make an offer to you; I have
nineteen months' pay due to me on board the ship ‘ ,’
which I came out of England in ; and the Dutchman that
is with me has seven months’ pay due to him. If you will
make good our pay to us, we will go along with you ; if
" ROBINSON causes. 437
if we do convince you that we have saved your lives, and
the ship, and the lives of all the men in her, we will leave
the rest to you."
I consented to this readily, and went immediately on
board, and the two men with me. As soon as I came to
the ship’s side, my partner, who was on board, came out
on the quarter deck, and called to me, with a great deal
of joy, “We have stopped the leak—we have stopped the
leak P ” “ Say you so ? ” said I ; “ thank God ! but weigh
anchor, then, immediately.” “ Weigh ! ” says he ; “ what
do you mean by that? What is the matter P ” “Ask no
questions," said I, “ but set all hands to work, and weigh
without losing a minute.” He was surprised ; however,
he called the captain, and he immediately ordered the an-
chor to be got up ; and though the tide was not quite
down, yet a little land-breeze blowing, we stood out to sea.
Then.I called him into the cabin, and told him the story;
and we called in the men, and they told us the rest of it;
but‘as it took up a great deal of time, before we had done
a seaman comes to the cabin door, and called out to us

sloops, or boats, full of men. “Very well,” said I ; “ then
it is apparent there is something in it}: I then ordered
all our men to be called up, and told them there was a de-
sign to seize the ship, and take us for pirates, and asked
them if they would stand by us, and by one another ; the
men answered cheerfully, one and all, that they would
live and die with us. Then I asked the captain what way

for resist them I was resolved we would, and that to

the last drop. He said readily that the way was to-keep
them off with our great shot as long as we could, and then
to use our small arms, to keep them from boarding us ;
but when neither of these would do any longer, we would
retire to our close quarters, for perhaps they had not
materials to break open our bulkheads, or get in upon us.
The gunner had, in the meantime, orders to bring two
guns, to bear fore and aft, out of the steerage, to clear the
deck, and load them with musket-bullets and small pieces
of oldiron, and what came next to hand. Thus we made

Notwithstanding this, they came on till they were near

It was all one ; they crowded after us, and endeavored
to come under our stern, so as to board us on our quarter;
upon which, seeing they were resolute for mischief, and
depended upon the strength that followed them, I ordered
to bring the ship to, so that they lay upon our broadside;

seeing the foremost, boat crowd‘ on after us, we made
438 ROBINSON causes. 1.-
one of the three boats that followed made up to the boat
which we had disabled, to relieve her, and we could see
her take out the men. We then called again to the fore-
most boat, and offered a truce, to parley again, and to
know what her business Was with us ; but had no answer,
only she crowded close under our stern. Upon this, our
gunner, who was a very dexterous fellow, ran out his two

easily see did a great deal of mischief among them. We
now wore the ship again, and brought our quarter to bear

was almost split to pieces ; in particular, her rudder and a
piece of her stern was shot quite away ; so they handed
her sail immediately, and were in great disorder. To com-
plete their misfortune, our gunner let fly two guns at them
again ; where he hit them we could not tell, but we found
the boat was sinking, and some of the men already in tlm
water ; upon this, I immediately manned out our pinnaee, '
with orders to pick up some of the men if they could, and
save them from drowning, and immediately come on board
ship with them, because we saw the rest of the boats be-
gan to come up. Our men in the pinnace followed their
orders, and took up three men, one of whom was just
drowning, and it was a good while before we could recover
him. -As soon as they were on board we crowded all the
sail we could make, and stood further out to the sea ; and
‘ ‘” “ ROBINSON cnusoa. 439
they gave over their chase.
Being thus delivered from a danger which, though I
knew not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater
than I apprehended, I resolved that we should change our
course, and not let any one know whither we were going;
so we stood out to sea eastward, quite out of the course of
all European ships, whether they were bound to China or
anywhere else, within the commerce of the European na-
tions. When we were at sea we began to consult with the
two seamen, and inquire what the meaning of all this

story about the false sale of the ship and of the murder of
the captain, and also how that be, this Dutchman, and
four more, got into the woods, where they wandered about
a great while, till at length he made his escape, and swam
off to a Dutch ship, which was sailing near the shore on its
way from China.
440 ' Roamsosr :RusoE. '
He then told us that he went to Batavia, where two of
the seamen belonging to the ship arrived, having deserted
the rest in their travels, and gave an account that the felt
low who had run away with the ship sold her at Bengal to
a set of pirates, who were gone a-cruising in her, and that
they had already taken an English ship and two Dutch
ships very richly laden. This latter part we found to con-
cern us directly, though we knew it to'be false; yet, as my
partner said, very justly, if we had fallen into their hands,
and they had had such a prepossession against us before-
hand, it had been in vain for us to have defended our-
selves, or to hope for any good quarter at their hands;
especially considering that our accusers had been our
judges, and that we could have expected nothing from
them but what rage would have dictated and an ungov-
erned passion have executed. Therefore it washis opinion
we should go directly back to Bengal, from whence we
came, without putting in at any port whatever—became
there we could give a good account of ourselves, could
prove where we were when the ship put in, of whom we
bought her, and the’like, and what was more than all the
rest, if we were put upon the necessity of bringing it be-
fore the proper judges, we should be sure to have some
440 ' Roamsosr :RusoE. '
I was some time of my partner’s opinion; but after a
little more serious thinking, I told him I thought it was a
very great hazard for us to attempt returning to Bengal,
for that we were on the wrong side of the Straits of Ma-
lacca, and that if the alarm was given, we should be sure
to be waylaid on every side—that ifv we should be taken,
as it were, running away, we should even condemn our-
selves, and there would want no more evidence to destroy
us. I also asked the English sailor’s opinion, who said he
was of my mind, and that we should certainly be taken.
This danger a little startled my partner and all the ship’s
company, and we immediately resolved to go away to the
coast of Tonquin, and so on to the coast of China—and
440 ' Roamsosr :RusoE. '
other to dispose of the ship, and come back in seme of the
vessels of the country, such as we could get. This was
approved of as the best method for our security; and ac-

winds, when we came that distance from the shore, seemed
to be more steadily against us, blowing almost trade, as we
call it, from the E. and E.N.E., so that we were a long
while upon our voyage, and we were but ill provided with
victuals for so long a run; and what was still worse, there
was some danger that those English and Dutch ships whose
boats pursued us, whereof some were bound that way,
might have got in before us, and if not, some other ship
bound to China might have information of us from them,
and pursue us with the same vigor.
I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought my-,
self, including the late escape from the long-boats, to have
been _in the most dangerous condition that ever I was in
through my past life; for whatever ill circumstances I had
been in, I was never pursued for a thief before; nor had I
ever done anything that merited the name of dishonest or

enemy, or, as I may rightly say, I had been nobody’s
enemy but my own; but now I was wofully embarrassed;
for though I was perfectly innocent, I was in no condition
to make that innocence appear; and if I had been taken, it
had been under a supposed guilt of the worst kind. This
made me very anxious to make an escape, though which
way to do it I knew not, or what port or place we could
go to. My partner endeavored to encourage me by de-
scribing the several ports of that coast, and told me he
would put in on the coast of Cochin China, or the bay of
Tonquin, intending afterward to go to Macao, where a
great many European families resided—and particularly
,the missionary priests, who usually went thither in order
to their going forward to China.
Hither then we resolved to go; and, accordingly, though
after a tedious course, and very much straitened for pro-
visions, we came within sight of the coast very early in
ROBINSON cnusoa. 441
of danger we were in, we resolved to put into a small river,
which, however, had depth enough of water for us, and to
see if we could, either, overland or by the ship's pinnace,,
come to know what ships were in any port thereabouts.
This happy step was, indeed, our deliverance, for though
we did not immediately see any European ships in the Bay
of Tonquin, yet the next morning there came into the bay
two Dutch ships; and a third without any colors spread
out, but which we believed to be a Dutchman, passed by
at about two leagues’ distance, steering for the coast of
China; and in the afternoon went by two English ships
steering the same course; and thus we thought we saw
ourselves beset with enemies both one way and the other.
The place we were in was wild and barbarous—the people
thieves by occupation ; and though, it is true, we had not
much to seek of them, and, except getting a few pro-
visions, cared not how little we had to do with them, yet
“3 ROBINSON CRUSOL
from being insulted by them several ways. We were in a
small river of this country, within a few leagues of its
utmost limits northward ; and by our boat we coasted
north-east, to the point Of land which opens the great bay
of Tonquin ; and it was in this beating up along the shore
that we discovered we were surrounded with enemies. The
people we were among were the most barbarous of all
the inhabitants of the coast; and among other customs
they have this one : that if any vessel has the misfortune
to be shipwrecked upon their coast, they make the men
all prisoners or slaves ; and it was not long before we
found a spice of their kindness this way, one the occasion
following.
I have observed above that our ship sprung a leak at

Situation. I
THE inhabitants came wondering down the shore to
look at us ; and seeing the ship lie down on one side in
such a manner, and heeling in toward the shore, and not
seeing our men, who were at work on her bottom with
stages, and with their boats on the Off-side, they presently
concluded that the ship was cast away, and lay fast on the
ground. On this supposition they came about us‘in two
or three hours’ time with ten or twelve large boats, having
some of them eight, some ten men in a boat, intending,
no doubt, to have come on board and plundered the ship,
and, if they found us there, to have carried us away for
slaves.
When they came up to the ship, and began to row round
her, they discovered us all hard at work on the outside of
the ship"s bottom and side,~washing, and graving, and
stopping, as every seafaring man knows how. They stood
for awhile gazing at us, and we, who were a little sur-
prised, could not imagine what their design was; but being
willing to be sure, we took this opportunity to get some of
us into the ship, and others to hand down arms and am-
munition to those that were at work, to defend themselves
with if there should be occasion. And it was no more
than need; for in less than a quarter of an hour’s consul-
tation, they agreed, it seems, that the ship was really a
wreck, and that we were all at work endeavoring to save
her, or to save our lives by the help of our boats; and
when we handed our arms into the boat, they concluded,
by that act, that we were endeavoring to save some of our
goods. Upon this, they took it for granted we all be-
longed to them, and away they came directly upon our
men, as if it had been in a line of battle.
Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be fright-
,ti*~' nosmson cRUsoa. 443
out to us to know what they should do. I immediately
called to the men that worked upon the stages to slip them
down, and get up the side into the ship, and bade those in
the boat to row round and come on board. The few who
were on board worked with all the strength and hand we
had to bring the ship to rights; however, neither the men
upon the stages nor those in the boats could do as they
' were ordered before the Cochin Chinese were upon them,
when two of theirboats boarded ourlong-boat, and began
to lay hold of the men as their prisoners.

than I could teach him, for he grappled the Pagan, and
dragged him by main force out cf their boat into ours,
where, taking him by the ears, he beat his head so against
the boat’s gunnel that the fellow died in his hands. In
the meantime, a Dutchman, who stood next, took up the
musket, and with the butt-end of it so laid about him,

thirty or forty men, who, fearless because ignorant of
their danger, began to throw themselves into the long-

the {OllQwing incident, which deserved our laughter, gave
our men a complete victory.
Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of
the ship, as well as to pay the seams where he had calked
her to stop the leaks, had got two kettles just let down
“4 nosmsorr cansep
with rosin, tallow, and oil, and such stuff as the ship-
wrights use for that work; and the man that attended the
carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand, with which
he supplied the men that were at work with the hot stuff.
Two of- the enemy’s men entered the boat just where this
fellow stood in the fore-sheets; he immediately saluted
them. with a ladle full of the stuff, boiling hot, which so
burned and scalded them, being half naked, that they

both into the sea. The carpenter saw it, and cried out,
“Well done, Jack, give them some more of it,” and step-

was never better pleased with a victory in my life; not
only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and that our dan-
ger was imminent before, but as we got this victory with-
out any bloodshed, except of that man the seaman killed
with his naked hands, and which I was very much con-
cerned at. Although it may be a just thing, because
necessary (for there is no necessary wickedness in nat-
ure), yet I thought it was a sad sort of life, when we must
be always obliged to be killin our fellow-creatures to
preserve ourselvesd—and, indee , I think so still; and I
would even now suffer a great deal rather than I would
take away the life even of the worst person injuring me;
and, I believe all considering people, who know the value
of life, would be of my opinion, if they entered seriously
into the consideration of it. _
All the while this was doing, my partner and I, who
had managed the rest of the men on board, had with great
dexterity brought the ship almost to rights, and having
got the guns into their place again, the gunner called to

among them. I called back again to him, and bid him

cook, who was on board, took care of. However, the

and having got some rice and some roots and bread, with
about sixteen hogs,on board two days before, we resolved
to stay here no longer, but go forward, whatever came of
it ; for we made no doubt but we should be surrounded
the next day with rogues enough, perhaps more than our
pitch~kettle would dispose of for us. We therefore got
all our things on board the same evening, and the next
morning were ready to sail; in the meantime, lying at
anchor at some distance from the shore, we were not so

ing our ship was perfectly healed of all her leaks, we set
sail. We would have gone into the Bay of Tonquin, for
we wanted to inform ourselves of what was to be known
concerning the Dutch ships that had been there ; but we
durst not stand in there, because we had seen several
ships go in, as we supposed, but a little before; so we kept
on N. E. toward the island of Formosa, as much afraid of
being seen by a Dutch or English merchant ship as a
Dutch or English merchant ship in the Mediterranean in
of an Algerine man-of-war.
When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. E., as if
we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine Islands ;
and this we did that we might not fall into the way of any
of the European ships ; and then we steered north till we
came to the latitude of twenty-two degrees thirty seconds,
by which means we made the island of Formosa directly,
where we came to an anchor, in order to get water and
fresh provisions, which the people there, who are very

other people, and may be owing to the remains of Chris-
tianity which was once planted here by a Dutch missionary
of Protestants, and it is a testimony of what I have
often observed—viz., that the Christian religion always
civilizes the people, and reforms their manners, where it
is received, whether it works saving effects upon them
or no.
From thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of
China at an equal distance, till we knew we were beyond
all the ports of China where our European ships usually
come; being resolved, if possible, not to fall into any of
their hands, especially in this country, where, as our cir-
cumstances were, we could > not fail of being entirely

come at ; and standing in for the shore, a boat came off
two leagues to us with an old Portuguese pilot on board,
who, knowing us to be a European ship, came off to offer
his services, which, indeed, we were glad of, and took him
on board; upon which, without asking us whither we would
go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and sent it back. I
thought it was now so much in our choice to make the old
man carry us whither we would, that I began to talk to
him about carrying us to the Gulf of Nankin, which is the
most northern part of the coast of China.‘ The old man
said he knew the Gulf of Nankin very well ; but smiling,
asked us what we would do there. I told him we would
sell our cargo and purchase China wares, calicoes, raw
silks, tea, wrought silks, etc.; and so we would return by
the same course we came. He told us our best port would
have been to put in at Macao, where we could not have
failed of a market for our opium to our satisfaction, and
might for our money have purchased all sorts of China
goods as cheap as we could at Nankin.
Not being able to' put the old man out of his talk, of
which he was very opinionated or conceited, I told him we
were gentlemen as well as merchants, and that we had a
mind to go and see the great city of Pekin, and the famous
court of the monarch of China. “Why, then,” says the
old man, “you should go to Ningpo, where, by the river

stream, which goes through the heart of that vast empire!
of China, crosses all the rivers, passes some considerable
hills, by the help of sluices and gates, and goes up to
the city of Pekin, being in length near two hundred
and seventy leagues." “Well,” said I. “ Senor Portu-
guese, but that is not our business now; the great
question is, if you can carry us up to the city of
Nankin, from whence we can travel to Pekin after-
ward?" He said he could do so very well, and that
there was a great Dutch ship gonea up that way just '
before. This gave me a little shock, for a Dutch ship
was now our terror, and we had much rather have
met the devil, at least if he had not come in too fright-

parts being of great burden, and of much greater force

The old man found me a little confused, and under some
concern when he named a Dutch ship, and said to me ;
“ Sir, you need be under no apprehensions of the Dutch;
I suppose they are not now at war with your nation__?"l
“No,” said I, “that’s true ; but I know not what liberties
men may take when they are out of the reach of the laws
of their own country." “ Why,” says he, “ you are nQ
pirates ; what need you fear? They will not meddle with
peaceable merchants, sure." These words put me into
the'greatest disorder and confusion imaginable ; nor was
it possible for me to conceal it so, but the old man easily
perceived it.

vice I can." Upon tiiis we fell into further discourse, in
which, to my alarm and amazement, he spoke of the villain;
ous doings of a certain pirate ship that had long been the
talk of mariners in those seas ; no other, in a word, than
the very ship he was now on board of, and which we had
so unluckily purchased. I presently saw there was no
help for it but to tell him the plain truth, and explain all
the danger and trouble we had suffered through this mis-
adventure, and, in particular, our earnest "wish to be
speedily quit of the ship altogether ; for which reason we
had resolved to carry up to Nankin.
The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us
we were in the right to go away to the north ; and that,'if
he might advise us, it should be to sell the ship in China,
which we might well do, and buy or build another in the
country; adding, that I should meet with customers enough
for the ship at Nankin, that a Chinese junk would serve
me very well to go back again ; and that herwould procure
me people both to buy one and sell the other. “Well,
but, senor," said I, “ as you say they know the ship so
well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your measures, be instrus

not the men that first went off with the ship,but innocent-
ly bought her for their trade ; and I am persuaded they
will so far believe me as at least to act more cautiously for
the time to come ”
In about thirteen days’ sail we came to an anchor, at
the south-west point of the great Gulf of Nankin ; where I
learned by accident that two Dutch ships were gone the
length before me, and that I should certainly fall into
their hands. I consulted my partner again in this
exigency, and he was as much at loss as I was. I then
asked the old pilot if there was no creek or harbor which
I might put. into and pursue my business with the Chinese
privately, and be in no danger of the enemy. He told me
if I would sail to the southward about forty-two leagues,
there was a little port called Quinchang, where the fathers
of the mission usually landed from Macao, on their prog-
ress to teach the Christian religion to the Chinese, and
where no European ships ever put in ; and if I thought to
put in there, I might consider what further course to take
when I was on shore. He confessed, he said, it was not a
place for merchants, except that at some certain times
they had a kind of fair there, when the merchants from
Japan came over thither to buy Chinese merchandises.
The name of the port I may perhaps spell wrong, having
lost this, together with the names of many other places set
down in a little pocket-book, which was spoiled by the
water by an accident ; but this I remember, that the
Chinese merchants we corresponded with called it bya
different name from that which our Portuguese pilot gave
it, who pronounced it Quinchang. As we were unanimous
in our resolution to go to this place, we weighed the next
day, having only gone twice on shore where we were, to
get fresh water; on both which occasions the people of the
country was very civil, and brought abundance of pro-
visions to sell to us; but nothing without money.
We did not come to the other port (the wind being

resolving, and my partner too, that if it was possible to

that unhappy vessel. Indeed, I mus-t acknowledge that
of all the circumstances of life that ever I had any ex-
perience, nothing makes mankind so completely miser-
able as that of being in constant fear. Well does the
Scripture say, “ The fear of man brings a snare;" it is a
life of death, and the mind is so entirely oppressed by it,
that it is capable of no relief.
Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy, by
heightening every danger; representing the English and
Dutch captains to be men incapable of hearing reason, or
of distinguishing between honest men and rogues; or be-
tween a story calculated for our own turn, made out of
nothing, on purpose to deceive, or a true, genuine ac-
count of our whole voyage, progress, and design; for we
might many ways have convinced any reasonable creatures
that we were not pirates; the goods we had on board, the
course we steered, our frankly showing ourselves, and en-
teringinto such and such ports; and even our very man-
ner, the force we had, the number of men, the few arms,
the little ammunition, short provisions; all these would
have served to convince any man that we were no pirates.
The opium and other goods we had on board would make
it appear the ship had been at Bengal. The Dutchman
who, it was said, had the names of all the men that were
in the ship, might easily see that we were a mixture of
English, Portuguese, and Indians, and but two Dutchmen
on board. These, and many other particular circum-
stances, might have made it evident to the understanding
of any commander whose hands we might fall into that
we were no pirates.
But fear, that blind, useless passion, worked another
way, and threw us into the vapors; it bewildered our un-
derstandings, and set the imagination at work to form a
thousand terrible things that perhaps might never happen.

that the seamen on board the English and Dutch ships,
but especially the Dutch, were so enraged at the name of
pirate, and especially at our beating off their boats and
escaping, that they would not give themselves leave to
inquire whether we were pirates or no, but would execute
us off-hand, without giving us any room for a defense.

Another apprehension I had was the cruel usage we might

confess to crimes they never were guilt of, or own them-

us to death with a formal appearance of justice; and that

appearing all smooth and plain; and truly it was 50' they
were all like men who, _had a load taken off their hacks.
For my part, I had a weight taken off from my heart that
it was not able any longer to bear; and, as I said above,
we resolved to go no more to sea in that ship. When we
came on shore, the old pilot, who was now our friend, got
us a lodging, together with a warehouse for our goods; it
was a little but, with a larger house adjoining to it, built
and also palisaded round with cane, to keep out ilferers,
of which‘there were not a few in that country; however,
the magistrates allowed us a little guard, and we had a
soldier with a kind of half pike, who stood sentinel at our.
door; to whom we allowed a pint of rice and a piece of
money about the value of threepence per day, so that our
goods were kept very safe. '
The fair or mart usually kept at this place had been
over some time; however, we found that there were three
or four junks in the river, and two ships from Japan, with
goods which they had bought in China, and were not gone
away, having some Japanese merchants on shore.

who were in the town, and who had been there sometime

tians when they had done. One of these was a tench-
man, whom they called Father Simon ; another was a
,Portuguese; and the third a Genoese. Father Simon was
courteous, and very agreeable company; butthe other two
were more reserved, seemed rigid and austere, and a plied
seriously to the work they came about—viz., to talk with
and insinuate themselves among the inhabitants wherever
they had opportunity. We often eat and drank with those
men; and though,'I must confess, the conversion, as they
call it, of the Chinese to Christianity, is so far from the
true con-version required to bring heathen people to the
faith of Christ that it seems to amount to little more than
letting them know the name of Christ, and say some
prayers to the Virgin Mary and her Son, in a tongue which
they understood not, and to cross themselves, and the like;
yet it must be confessed that the religionists, whom we

be saved, and that they are the instruments of it ; and on
this account they undergo not only the fatigue of the voy-
age, and the hazards of living in such places, but often-
times death itself, and the most violent tortures, for the
sake of this work.
Father Simon was appointed, it seems, by order of the
chief of the mission, to go up to Pekin, and waited only
for another priest, who was ordered to come to him from
Macao, to go along with him. We scarce ever met to-
gether but he was inviting me to go that journey ; telling
me how he would show me all the glorious things of that
mighty empire, and, among the rest, Pekin, the greatest
city in the world. “ A city,” said he, “that your London _
and our Paris put together can not be equal to." But as
I looked on those things with different eyes from other
men, so I shall give my opinion of them in a few words,
when I come in the course of my travels to speak more
particularly of them. /
Dining with Father Simon one day, and being very
merry together, I showed some little inclination to go with
him ; and he pressed me and my partner very hard to con-
sent. “ Why, father," says my partner, “ should you de-
sire our company so much? you know we are heretics, and
you do not love us, nor can not keep us company with any
pleasure." “ Oh," says he, “you may perhaps be good
Catholics in time: my business here is to convert heathens,
and who knows but I may convert you too ? " “ Very well,
father," said I, “ so you will preach to us all the way? "
“ I will not be troublesome to you," says he; “ our religion
does not divest us of good manners ; besides, we are here
like countrymen ; and so we are, compared to the place
we are in ; and if you are Huguenots, and I a Catholic, we
may all be Christians at last; at least, we are all gen-
tlemen, and we may converse so without being uneasy
to one another." I liked this part of his discourse very
well, and it began to put me in mind of my priest that
I had left in the Brazils ; but Father Simon did not
come up to his character by a great deal; for though
this friar had no appearance of a criminal levity in him,
yet he had not that fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and
sincere affection to religion that my other good ecclesias-
tic had.
But to leave him a little, though he never left us, nor
solicited us to go with him, we had something else before

chandise to dispose of, and we began to be very doubtful
what we should do, for we were now in a place of very lit-
tle business. Once I was about to venture to sail for the
river of Kilam, and the city of Nankin ; but Providence
seemed now more visibly, as I thought, than ever to con-
cern itself in our affairs ; and I was encouraged, from this
very time, to think I should, one way or other, get out
of this entangled circumstance, and be brought home to
my own country again, though I had not the least view of
the manner. Providence, I say, began here to clear up

our old Portuguese pilot brought a Japan merchant to us
ROBINSON cnvsos. 455
he bought all our opium, and gave us a very good price
for it, paying us in gold by weight, some in small pieces
of their own coin, and some in small wedges of about ten
or twelve ounces each. While we were dealing with him
for our opium, it came into my head that he might per-
haps deal for the ship too, and I ordered the interpreter
to propose it to him. He shrunk up his shoulders at it
ROBINSON cnvsos. 455
he came to me, with one of the missionary priests for his
interpreter, and told me he had a proposal to make to me,
which was this : he had bought a great quantity of our
goods, when he had no thought of proposals made to him
of buying the ship ; and that, therefore, he had not money
to pay for the ship ; but if I would let the same men who
were in the ship navigate her, he would hire the ship to
go to Japan ; and would send them from thence to the
Philippine Islands with another loading, which he would
pay the freight of before they went from Japan; and that
at their return he would buy the ship. I began to listen
to his proposal, and so eager did my head still run upon
rambling, that I could not but begin to entertain a notion
of going myself with him, and so to set sail from the
Philippine Islands away to the South Seas; accordingly, I
asked the Japanese merchant if he would not hire us to the


Phillippine Islands and discharge us there. He said no,
he could not do that, for then he could not have the re-
t r: of his cargo ; but he would discharge us in Japan, at
the ship's return. Well, still I was for taking him at that
proposal, and going myself ; but my partner, wiser than
myself, pursuaded me from it, representing the dangers, as
well of the seas as of the Japanese, who are a false,
cruel, and treacherous people ; likewise those of the
Spaniards at the Philippines, more false, cruel, and
treacherous than they. '

Were willing to go to Japan. While I was doing this, the
young man whom my nephew had left with me as my com-
panion came up,and told me that he thought that voyage
promised very fair, and that there was a great prospect of
advantage, and he would be very glad if I undertook it;
but that if I would not, and would give him' leave, he
would go as a merchant, or as I pleased to order him ;
that if he ever came to England, and I Was there and
alive, he would render me a faithful account of his success,
which should be as much mine as I pleased. I Was loath
to part with him ; but considering the prospect of advan-
tage, which really was considerable, and that he was a
young fellow likely to do well in it, I inclined to let him
go; but I told him I would consult my partner, and give
him an answer the next day. I discoursed about it with
my partner, who thereupon made a most generous offer.
“ You know it has been an unlucky ship,” said he, “ and
we both resolve not to go to sea in it again ; if your stew.
ard (so he called my man) will venture the voyage, I will
leave my share of the vessel to him, and let him make the
best of it ; and if we live to meet in England, and he
meets with success abroad, he shall account forone half

his own."
If my partner, who was _no way concerned with my
young man, made him such an offer, I could not do less
than offer him the same; and all the ship’s company being
willing to go with him, we made over half the ship to him
in property, and took a writing from him, obliging him to
account for the other, and away he went to Japan. The
japan merchant proved a very punctual, honest man to
him ; protected him at Japan, and got him a license to
come on shore, which the Europeans in general have not
lately obtained. He paid him his freight very punctually;
sent him to the Philippines, loaded with Japan and China

the Spaniards, brought back European goods again, and
a great quantity of spices ; and there he was not only paid
his freight very well, and at a very good price, but not be-
( ing willing to sell the ship, then the merchant furnished
him goods on his own account ; and with some money,
and some spices of his own which he brought with him,
he went back to the Manillas, where he sold his cargo very
well. Here,having made a good acquaintance at Manilla,
he got his ship made a free ship, and the Governor of
Manilla hired him to go to Acapulco, on the coast of
America, and gave him a license to land there, and to
travel to Mexico, and to pass in any Spanish ship to Eu-
rope with all his men. He made the voyage to Acapulco
very happily, and there he sold his ship; and having there
also obtained allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello,
he found means to get to Jamaica, with all his treasure,
and about eight years after came to England exceeding
rich.
But to return to our particular affairs: being now to part
' with the ship and ship's company, it came before us, of
course, to consider what recompense we should give to the
two men that gave us such timely notice of the design
against us in the river Cambodia. The truth was, they
had done us a very considerable service, and deserved well
at our hands; though, by the Way, they were a couple of
r0gues, too; for, as they believed the story of our being
pirates, and that we had really run away with the ship,
they came down to us, not only to betray the design that
was formed against us, but to go to sea with us as pirates.
One of them confessed afterward that nothing but the
hopes of going a-roughing brought him to do it; however,
the service they did us was not the less, and, therefore, as

mOney to be paid them which they said was mm to them
on board their respective ships; over and above that, I
gave each of them a small sum of money in gold, which
contented them very well. I then made the Englishman
gunner in the ship, the gunner being now made second
mate and purser; the Dutchman I made boatswain; so
they were both very well pleased, and proved very ser-
viceable, being both able seamen, and very stout fellows.
We were now on shore in China; if I thought myself
banished, and remote from my own country at Bengal,
where I had many ways to get home for my money, what
tould I think of myself now, when I was about athousand
leagues further off from home, and destitute of all manner
of prospect of return? All we had for it was this: that
in about four months’ time there was to be another fair at
the place where we were, and then we might be able to
purchase various manufactures of the country, and withal

sale, that would carry us and our goods whither we pleased.
This I liked very well, and resolved to wait; besides, as
our particular persons were not obnoxious, so if any Eng-
lish or Dutch ships came thither, perhaps we might have
an opportunity to load our goods, and get passage to
some other place in India nearer home. Upon these
hopes we resolved to continue here; but to divert our-
selves, we took two or three journeys into the country.
First, we went ten days journey to Nankin, a city well

the commerce, and conduct of these people; not that

fallen this way, instead of attacking the war-like Swedes,
and equally improved himself in the art of war, as they
say he has done; and if none of the powers of Europe
had envied or interrupted him, he might by this time have
been Emperor of China, instead of being beaten by the
King of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not one to
six in number.

pared to the same things in Europe ; also, in their knowl-
edge, their learning, and in their skill in the sciences, they
are either very awkward or defective, though they have
globes or spheres, and a smattering of the mathematics,
and think they know more than all the world besides.
But they know little of the motions of the heavenly bodies;
and 'so grossly and absurdly ignorant are their common
people, that when the sun is eclipsed, they think a great
dragon has assaulted it, and is going to runaway with it;
and they fall a-clattering with all the drums and kettles
in the 'country, to fright the monster away, just as we do
to hive a sWarm of bees.
As this is the only excursion of the kind which I have
made in all the accounts I have given of my travels, so I
shall make no more such. It is none of my business, nor
any part Of my design; but to give an account of my own
adventures through a life of inimitable wanderings and a
long variety of changes, which, perhaps, few that come
after me will have heard the like of; I shall, therefore, say
very little of all the mighty places, desert countries, and
numerous people I have yet to pass through, more than
relates to my own story, and which my concern among
them make necessary.
Iwas now, as near as I can compute, in the heart of
China, about thirty. degrees north of the line, for we were
returned from Nankin. I had indeed a mind to see the
city of Pekin, which I had heard so much of, and Father -
Simon importuned me daily to do it. At length his time
of going away being set, and the other missionary who

the retinue of one of their mandarins, a kindof viceroy
or principal magistrate in the province where they reside,
and who take great state upon them, traveling with great
attendance, and great homage from the people, who were
sometimes greatly impoverished by them, being obliged
to furnish provisions for them and all their attendants in
their journeys. I particularly observed in our traveling \

visions both for ourselves and our horses from the coun-
try, as belonging to the mandarin, yet we were 0bliged to
pay for everything we had, after the market price of the
country, and the mandarin’s steward collected it duly
from us. Thus our traveling in the retinue'of the manda-
rin, though it was a great act of kindness, was not Such a
mighty favor to us, but was a great advantage to him,
considering there were above thirty other people traveled
in the same manner besides us, under the protection of
his retinue; for the country furnished all the provisions
for nothing to him, and yet he took our money for them.

by nothing but their poverty, in some parts, which adds
to that which I call their misery; and I must needs think
the savages of America live much more happy than the
poorer sort of these, because as they have nothing, so they
desire nothing; whereas these are proud and insolent, and
in the main are in many parts mere beggars and drudges.
Their Ostentation is inexpressible; and, if they can, they
love to keep multitudes of servants or slaves, which is to
the last degree ridiculous, as well as their contempt of all
the world but themselves.
I must confess I traveled more pleasantly afterward in
the deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartary than
here, and yet the roads here are well paved and well kept,
and very convenient for travelers ; but nothing was more
awkward to me than to see such a haughty, imperious, in-
solent pe0ple, in the midst _of the grossest simplicity and
ignorance ; and my friend Father Simon and I used to be
very merry upon these occasions, to See their beggarly
pride. For example, coming by the house of a country

state he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being a
mixture of pomp and poverty. His habit was very proper
\




for a merry-andrew, being a dirty calico, with hanging
sleeves, tassels, and cuts and slashes almost on every side;
it covered a taffety vest, so greasy as to_testify that his
honor must be a most exquisite sloven. His horse was a
poor, starved, hobbling creature, and two slaves followed
him on foot to drive the poor creature along; he had a
whip in his hand, and he belabored the beast as fast about
the head as his slaves did about the tail; and thus he rode
by us, with about ten or twelve servants, going from the
city to his country seat, about half a league before us.

rode away before us; and as we stopped at a village about
an hour to refresh us, when we came by the country seat
of this great man, we saw him in a little place before his
door, eating a repast. It was a kind of garden, but he
was easy to be seen; and we were given to understand
that the more we looked at him the better he would be
pleased. He sat under a tree, something like the pal-
metto, which effectually shaded him over the head, and
on the south side ; but under the tree was placed a large
umbrella, which made that part look well enough. He
sat lolling back in a great elbow~chair, being a heavy, cor-
pulent man, and had his meat brought him by two women
slaves. He had two more, one of whom fed the squire
with a spoon, and the other held the dish with one hand,
and scraped off what he 'le; fall upon his worship’s beard
and taffety vest.
Leaving the poor wretch to please himself with our
'looking at him, as if we admired his idle pomp, we pur-
sued our journey. Father Simon had the curiosity/to stay
to inform himself what dainties the country justice had to
feed on in all his state, which he had the honor to taste
of, and which was, I think, a mess of boiled rice, with a

who we supposed were to eat of the same after their mas-
ter. As for our mandarin with whom we traveled, he was
respected as a king. surrounded always with his gentle-
man. and attended in all his appearances with such pomp
/

that I new little of him but at a distance. I observed that
there was not a horse in his retinue but that our carriers'
pack-horses in England seemed to me to look much bet-
ter; though it was hard to judge rightly, for they were so
covered with equipage, mantles, trappings, etc., that we
could scarce see anything but their feet and their heads
as they went along.
I was now light-hearted, and all my late trouble and
perplexity being over, I had no anxious thoughts about
me, which made this journey the pleasanter to me; in
which no ill accident attended me, only in passing or ford-
ing a small river, my horse fell and made me free of the
country, as they call it—that is to say, threw me in. The
place was not deep, but it wetted me all over. I mention
it because it spoiled my pocket-book, wherein I had set
down the names of seVeral people and places which I had
occasion to remember, and which, not taking due care of,
the leaves rotted, and the words were never after to be
read.
At length we arrived at Pekin. I had nobody with me
but the y0uth whom my nephew had given me to attend
me as a servant, and who proved very trusty and diligent;
and my partner had nobody with him but one servant, who
was a kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being de-
sirous to see the court, we bore his charges for his com-
pany, and for our use of him as an interpreter, for he un-
derstood the language of the country, and spoke good
French and a little English. Indeed, this old man was
most useful to us everywhere; for we had not been above
a week at Pekin, when he came laughing. “Ah, Senor
Inglese," says he, “I have something to tell will make
your heart glad." “My heart glad," says I ; “what can
that be ; I don’t know anything in this country can either
give me joy or grief to any great degree." “Yes, yes,”
said the old man, in broken English, “make you glad, me
sorry.” “ Why," said I, “ will it make you sorry P"
“ Because,” said he, “ you have brought me here twenty-

and which way shall I get to my port afterward, without
a ship, without a horse, without pecune ?—~so he called
money, being his broken Latin, of which he had abun-
dance to make us merry with. In short, he told us there
was a great caravan of Muscovite and Polish merchants

we would take the opportunity to go with them, and leave
him behind, to go back alone. I
I confess I was greatly deli .hted with this good news,
and had scarcepower to spea to him for some time, but
at last I said to him, “ How do you know this? are you
sure it is true P” “Yes,” saYs he; “I met this morning
in the street an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian,
who is among them. He came last from Astracan and
was designed to go to Tonquin, where I formerly new
hirrf, but has altered his mind, and is now resolved to go
with the caravan to Moscow, and so down the river Wolga
to Astracan.” “Well, senor,” says I. “ do not be uneasy
about being left to go back alone; if this be a. method for
my return to England, it shall be your fault if you go
back to Macao at all." We then went to consult together
what was to be done; and I asked my partner what he
thought of the pilot’s news, and whether it would suit
with his affairs? He told me he would do just as I
would; for he had settled all his affairs so well at Bengal,
and left his effects in such good hands, that as we had
made a good voyage, if he could invest it in China silks,
wrought and raw, he would be content to go to England,
alrlid then make a voyage back to Bengal by the Company's
s 1 s.
IPIaving resolved upon this, we agreed that if our Portu-
guese pilot would go with us, we would hear his charges
to Moscow, or to England, if he pleased; nor, indeed,
were we to be esteemed 0v ergenerOus in that either, if we
had not rewarded him further, the service he had done
, us being really worth more than that; for he had not only
been a pilot to us at sea, but he had been like a broker
for us on shore; and his procuring for us a japan mer-
chant was some hundreds of pounds in our pockets. So
being willing to gratify him, which was but doing him
justice, and very willing also to have him with us besides,
or he was a m0st necessary man on all occasions, we
agreed to give him a quantity of coined gold, which, as I

pounds sterling, between us, and to bear all his charges,
9th for himself and horse, except only a horse to carry
he goods. Having settled this between ourselves, we
called him to let him know what we resolved. I told him
he had complained of our being willing to let him go
back alone, and I was now about to tell him we designed
he should not go back at all. That as we had resolved to
go to Europe with the caravan, we were very willing he
should go with us; and that we called him to know his
mind. He shook his head and said it was a long journey,

sist himself when he came there. We told him we be—
lieved it was so, and therefore we had resolved to do
something for him that should let him see how sensible
we were of the service he had done us, and also how
agreeable he was to us; and then I told him what we had
resolved to give him here, which he might lay out as we
woiild do our own; and that as for his charges, if he
would go with us we would set him safe on shore (life
and casualties excepted), either in Muscovy or England,
as he would choose, at our own charge,except only the
carriage of his goods. He received the proposal like a
man transported, and told us he would go with us over
all the whole world; and so we all prepared for our
journey. However, as it was with us, so it was with the
other merchants; they had many things to do, and instead

camels for our share, besides those we rode upon ; these,
with two or three spare horses, and two horses loaded with
provisions, made together twenty-six camels and horses in
our retinue.
The company was very great, and, as near as I can re-
member, made between three and four hundred horses,
and upward of one hundred and twenty men, very well
armed and provided for all events; for as the eastern
caravans are subject to be attacked by the Arabs, so are
these by the Tartars. The company consisted of peo-

The road all on this side of the country is very popu-
lous, and is full of potters and earth-makers—that is to
say, people that temper the earth for the China ware. As
I was coming along, our Portuguese pilot, who had always
something or other to say to make us merry, told me he
would show me the greatest rarity in all the country, and
that I should have this to say of China, after all the ill-
humored things that I had said of it, that I had seen one
thing which was not to be seen in all the world beside. I
was very importunate to know what it was ; at last he told
me it was a gentleman’s house built with China ware.
_...,~_,, _‘y
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 467

"Well," says, I, “are not the materials of their buildings
the products of their own country, and so it is all China
ware, is it not?” “ No, no," says he, “ I mean it is a
house all made of China ware, such as you call it in Eng-
land, or as it is called in our country, porcelain." “ Well,"
says I, “ such a thing may be. How big is it? Can we
carry it in a box upon a camel? If we can we will buy it.”
“Upon a camel l " says the old pilot, holding up both“
his hands ; “ why, there is a family of thirty people lives
in it." ' .
I was then curious, indeed, to see it; and when I came
to it, it was nothing but this: it was a timber house, or a
house built, as we call it in England, with lath and plaster,
but all this plastering was really China ware—that is to
say, it was plastered with the earth that makes China ware.
The outside, which the sun shone hot upon was glazed,
and looked very well, perfectly white, and painted with
_...,~_,, _‘y

the walls, instead of wainscot, were lined with hardened
and painted tiles, like the little square tiles we call galley-

several parts of England ; as hard as stone, and smooth,
but not burned and painted, except some smaller rooms,
like closets, which were all, as it were, paved with the
same tiles ; the ceiling and all the plastering work in the
whole house were of the same earth ; and, after all, the
roof was covered with tiles of the same, but of a deep shin-
ing black. This was a China ware house indeed, truly and
literally to be called so, and had I not been upon the
journey, I could have stayed some days to see and ex-
amine the particulars of it. They told me there were

As this is one of the singularities of China, so they may

be allowed to excel in it; but I am very sure they end
in their accounts of it; for they told me such incredible
things of their performance in crockery ware, for such it
is, that I care not to relate, as knowing it could not be true.

the wall bounds, without measuring the windings and turn-

I stood still an hour or thereabouts without trespassing
on our orders (for so long the caravan was in passing the
gate), to look at it on every side, near and far off 3 I mean
what was within my view ; and the guide, who had been
extolling it for the wonder of the world, was mighty eager
to hear my opinion of it. I told him it was a m05t excel-
lent thing to keep out the Tartars ; which he happened
not to understand as I meant it, and so took it for a compli-
ment ; but the old ilot laughed : “ Oh, Senor Inglese,”
says he, “ you spea in colors.” “ In colors 1 ” said I,
“ what do you mean by that i’” “ Why, you speak what
looks white this way and black that way—gay one way and
dull another. You tell him it is a good wall to keep out
Tartars ; you tell me by that it is good for nothing but to
keep out Ta'rtars. I understand you, Senor Inglese, I uns
derstand you ; but Senor Chinese understood you his own
way.” “Well,” says I, “ do you think it would stand out
an army of our country people, with a good train of
artillery; or our engineers, with two companies of miners ?
Would net they batter it down in ten days, that an
army might enter in battalia; or blow it up in the air,
foundation and all, that there should be no sign of it
left ? ”_ “Ay, ay,” says he, “ I know that.” The Chinese
wanted mightily to know what I said to the pilot, and
I gave him leave to tell him a few days after, for we
were then almost out of their country, and he was to
leave us a little time after this ; but when he knew What I
said, he was dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard no

keeping together in a caravan as We traveled, for we saw'
several troops of Tartars roving about ; but when I came
to see them distinctly, I wondered more that the Chinese
Empire could be conquered by such contemptible felIOWs;

In pursuit of this odd ~ort of game it was our hap to
meet with about forty Tartars ; whether they were hunt-

one of them blew a hideous blast on a kind of horn. This

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to be
among us ; and as soon as he heard the horn he told us
that we had nothing to do but to charge them without loss
of time ; and drawing us up in a line, he asked if we were

held us three days' and nights’ march ;and we were
obliged to carry our water with us in great leathern bot-
tles, and to encamp all night, just as I have heard they
do in the desert of Arabia. I asked our guides whose do-
minion this was in, and they told me this was a kind of
border that might be called no man’s land, being a part
of Great Karakathy, or Grand Tartary; that, however,
it was all reckoned as belonging to China, but that
there was no care taken here to preserve it from the in-
roads of thieves, and therefore it was reckoned the worst
desert in the whole march, though we were to go over some
much larger.
In passing this frightful wilderness we saw, two or three
times, little parties of the Tartars, but they seemed to
be upon their own affairs, and to have no design up-
on us; and so, like the man who met the devil, if they
had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to say to
them; we let them go. Once, however, a party of
them came so near as to stand and gaze at us.
Whether it was to consider if they should attack us
or not, we knew not; but when we had passed at'
some distance by them, we made a rear-guard of forty
men, and stood ready for them, letting the caravan
pass half a mile or thereabouts before us. After awhile

down by main force a little toward him, with the other

In this interval the poor Chinese came in who had

By this time I was a little recovered. I thought, when

but, as I said above, I wondered where I was, how I came
upon the ground, and what was the matter. A few mo-
ments after, as sense returned, I felt pain,though I did not
know where; so I clapped my hand to my head, and took
it away bloody ; then I felt my head ache; and in a mo-
ment memory returned, and everything was present to me
again. I jumped upon my feet instantly, and got hold of
my sword, but no enemies were in view; I found a Tartar
lying dead, and his horse standing very quietly by him ,
and, looking further, I saw my deliverer, who had been to
see what the Chinese had done, coming back with his
hanger in his hand. The old'man, seeing me on my feet,
came running to me, and joyfully embraced me, being
afraid before that I had been killed. Seeing me bloody,
he would see how I was hurt ; but it was not much, only

We made no great gain, however, by this victory, for we
lost a camel and gained a horse. I paid for the lost camel,
and sent for another; but I did not go to fetch it myself;
I had had enough of that.

ney of this city when messengers were sent express to
every part of the road to tell all travelers and caravans to
halt till they had a guard sent for them ; for that an un-
usual body of Tartars, making ten thousand in all,
had appeared in the way, about thirty miles beyond the

'}l"his was very bad news to travelers; however, it was
carefully done of the governor, and we were very glad
to hear we should have a guard. Accordingly two days
after, we had two hundred soldiers sent us from a gar-
rison of the Chinese on our left, and three hundred
more from the city of Naum, and with these we ad-
vanced boldly. The three hundred soldiers from Naum
marched in our front, the two hundred in our rear, and our
men on each side of our camels, with our baggage and
the whole caravan in the center; in this order, and well
prepared for battle, we thought ourselves a match for the
whole ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared;
but the next day, when they did appear, it was quite an-
other thing. .

EARLY in the morning, when marching from a little
town called Changu, we had a river to pass,which we were
obliged to ferry ; and, had the Tartars had any intelli-
gence, then had been the time to have attacked us, when,
the caravan being over, the rear-guard was behind ; but
they did not appear there. About three hours after, when

miles over, we knew, by a cloud of dust they raised, that
the enemy was at hand, and presently they came on upon
the spur.
Our Chinese guards in the front, who had talked so big
the day before, began to stagger; and the soldiers fre-
quently looked behind them, a certain sign in a soldier that
he is just ready to run away. My old pilot was of my
'mind; and being near me, called out, “Senor Inglese,


these fellows must be encouraged, or they will ruin us all;
for if the Tartars come on they will never stand it." “I
am of your mind,” said I ; “ but what must be done?”

this they will every man turn his back.” Immediately I
rode up to our leader and told him, who was exactly of our

and so we marched, leaving the last two hundred men to
make a body of themselves, and to guard the camels; only
that, if need were, they should send a hundred men to as-

front of our line; and, as we found them within gunshot,
our leader ordered the two wings to advance swiftly, and
give them a salvo on each wing with their shot, which was
done. They then went off, I suppose, to give an account
of the reception they were like to meet with ; indeed, that
salute cloyed their stomachs, for they immediately halted,
stood awhile to consider of it, and wheeling off to the left,
they gave over their design for that time, which was very
agreeable to our circumstances.
Two days after we came to the city of Naun, or Naum;
we thanked the governor for his care of us, and collected
to the value of a hundred crowns, or thereabouts, which
we gave to the soldiers sent to guard us ; and here we
rested one day. This is a garrison indeed, and there were
nine hundred soldiers kept here; but the reason of it was,
that formerly the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them
than they now do. the Muscovites having abandoned that
part of the country, which lies from this city west fo't'

above two thousand miles from Muscovy properly so called.
After this we passed several rivers, and two dreadful des-
erts; one of which we were sixteen days passing over.-

I could not but feel great satisfaction that I was arrived in

Christians, yet such they pretend to be, and are very de-

ing man who travels the world as I have done, what a
blessing it is to be brought into the world where the name
of God and a Redeemer is known, adored, and worshiped;
and not where the people, given up to strong delusions,
worship the devil, and prostrate themselves to monsters,
elements, horrid-shaped animals, and monstrous images.
Not a town or city we passed through but had their pago-
das, their idols, and their temples, and ignorant people
worshiping even the works of their own hands. Now we
came where, at least, a face of the Christian worship ap-
eared; where the knee was bowed to Jesus ; and whether
ignorantly or not, yet the Christian religion was owned,
and the name of the true God was called upon and adored;
and it made my soul rejoice to see it. I saluted the brave

taking him by the hand, I said to him, “ Blessed be God,1
we are once again among Christians.” He smiled, and
answered, “ Do not rejoice too soon, countryman ; these
Muscovites are but an odd Sort of Christians ; and but for
the name of it you may see very little of the substance for
some months further of our journey." “ Well," says I,
“but still it is better than paganism, and worshiping of
devils.” “ Why, I will tell you,” says he, “except the
Russian soldiers in the garrisons, and a few of the inhabi-
tants of the cities upon the road, all the rest of this country,
far above a thousand miles further, is inhabited by the worst
and most ignorant of pagans.” And so, indeed, we found it.
We now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth
that is to be found in any part of the world ; we had, at
least, twelve thousand miles to the sea eastward; two thou-
sand to the bottom of the Baltic Sea westward; and above
three thousand, if we left that sea, and went on west, to

eight hundred to the Frozen Sea north.
We advanced from the river Arguna by eas and moder-
ate journeys, and were Very visibly oblige to the care
the czar has taken to have cities and towns built in as
many place as it is possible to place them, where his
soldiers keep garrison, something like the stationary

were placed in Britain, for the security of commerce,
and for the lodging of travelers. Thus it was here;

as twenty days to travel over. In a village near the last

at the door of a hut, made of sheep and cow-skins dried,

I confess I was more moved at their stupidity and bru-
tish worship of a hobgoblin than ever I was at mything
in my life, and, overcome with rage, I rode up to the hide~
ous idol, and with my sword made a stroke at the bonnet
that was on its head, and cut it in two ; and one of our
men that was with me, taking hold of the sheep-skin that
covered it, pulled at it, when, behold ! a most hideous out-
cry ran through the village, and two or three hundred peo-
le came about my cars, so that I was glad to scour for
it, for some had bows and arrows ; but I resolved from
that moment to visit them again. Our caravan rested three
nights at the town, which was about four miles off, in
order to provide some horses which they wanted, several
of the horses having been lamed and jaded with the long
march over the last desert ; so we had some leisure here
to put my design in execution. I communicated it to the

and added that, from his knowledge of the country and
its customs, he feared we should fall into great peril by
giving offense to these brutal idol worshipers. This some-
what stayed my purpose, but I was still uneasy all that
day to put my project in execution ; and that evening,
meeting the Scots merchant in our walk about the town,
I again called upon him to aid me in it. When he' found
me resolute he said that, on further thought, he could not

us; “and one,” said he, “as famous for his zeal as
you can desire any one to be against such devilish
things as these.” So we agreed to goal, only we three
and my man-servant, and resolved to put it in execu
tion the following night about midnight, with all poss-»
ble secrecy.
We thought it better to delay it till the next night, be-
cause the caravan being to set forward in the morning, we
supposed the governor could not pretend to give them
any satisfaction upon us when we were out of his power.
The Scots merchant, as steady in his resolution for
the enterprise as bold in executing, brought me a Tar-
tar’s robe or gown of sheep-skins, and a bonnet, with ‘
a bow and arrows, and had provided the same for him-
self and his countryman, that the people, if they saw

night we spent in mixing up some combustible matter,
with aqua m'lw, gunpowder, and such other materials as
we could get; and having a good quantity of tar in a
little pot, about an hour after night we set out upon our
expedition.
We came to the place about eleven o’clock at night, and
found that the people had not the least suspicion of danger
attending their idol. The night was cloudy; yet the moon
gave us light enough to see that the idol stood just in
the same posture and place that it did before. The
people seemed to be all at their rest; only that in the
great hut, where we saw the three priests, we saw at
light, and going up close to the door, we heard people

“Well, then," said the Scots merchant,“ I will tell you
what we will do: we will try to make them prisoners,
tie their hands, and make them stand and see their idol
destroyed.”
As it happened, we had twine or pack-thread enough-

did we knocked at the door, when one of the priests
coming to it, we immediately seized upon him, and led
him to the idol, where we gagged him that he might not
make a noise, tied his feet also together, and left him on
the ground.
Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that ans
other would come out to see what the matter was; but
we waited so long till the third man came back to us; and
then nobody coming out, we knocked again gently, and
immediately out came two more, and we served them just
in the same manner, but were obliged to go all with them,
and lay them down by the idol some distance from one
another ; when, going back, we found two more were come
out of the door, and a third stood behind them within
the door. We seized the two, and immediately tied
them, when the third, stepping back and crying out,

We quickly took them from the hut, where the smoke
soon drove us out, bound them as we had done thev
others, and all without any noise. Then we carried them

work with him. First, we daubed him all over. and his

man remembered that by the hut, where the men were,
there lay a heap of dry forage; and away he and
the other Sootsman ran and fetched their arms full
of that. When we had done this, we took all our
prisoners, and brought them, having untied their feet and

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour or thereabouts,
till the powder in the eyes, and mouth, ears of the
idol blew up, and as we could perceive, had split
altogether; and in a word, till we saw it burned so
that it would soon be quite consumed. We then be-
gan to think of going away; but the Scotsman said,

selves with the idol." So we resolved to stay till the
forage was burned down too, and then came away
and left them. After the feat was performed, we ap-
peared in the morning among our fellow-travelers, ex-
ceedingly busy in getting ready for our journey; nor
could any man suppose that we had been anywhere but
in our beds.
But the affair did not end so; the next day came a great
number of the country people to the town gates, and in a
most outrageous manner demanded satisfaction of the
Russian governor for the insulting their priests and burn~
ing their great Cham Chi-Thaungu. The people of Nort-

said the Tartars were already no less than thirty
thousand strong. The Russian governor sent out mes-
sengers to appease them, assuring them that he knew
nothing of it, and that there had not a soul in his
garrison been abroad, so that it could not be from anybody
there : _but if they could let him know who did it, they
should be exemplarily punished. They returned haughti-
1y that all the country reverenced the great Chain Chi-
Thaungu, who dwelt in the sun, and no mortal would have
dared to offer violence to 'his image but some Christian
miscreant ; and they therefore resolved to denounce war
against him and all the Russians, who, they said, were
miscreants and Christians.
The governor, unwilling to make a breach, or to have
any cause of war alleged to be given by him, the czar hav-
ing strictly charged him to treat the conquered country
with gentleness, gave them all the good words he could.
At last he told them there was a caravan gone toward
Russia that morning, and perhaps it was some of them
who had done them this injury ; and that they would be

into it. This seemed to appease them alittle; and accord-
ingly the governor sent after us, and gave us a particular
account how the thing was ; intimating withal, that if any
in our caravan had done it they should make their escape;
but whether we had done it or no, we should make
all the haste forward that was possible : and that, in
the meantime, he would keep them in play as long as he
could.
This was very friendly in the governor : however, when
it came to the caravan, there was nobody knew anything
of the matter; and as for us that were guilty, we were
least of all suspected. However, the captain of the cara-
van for the time took the hint that the governor gave us,
and we traveled two days and two nights without any con-
siderable stop, and then we lay ata village called Plothus'
nor did we make any long stop here, but hastened 0;

expected we should be safe. But upon the second day s

body of horses appear on the other side of the lake, to-

away west, as we did, but had supposed we would have
that side of the lake, whereas, we very happily took the south
side; and in two days more they disappeared again : for
they, believing we were still before them, pushed on till we
came to the Udda, a very great river when it passes fur-
ther north, but when we came to it we found it narrow and
fordable.
The third day they had either found their mistake,
or had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us
toward dusk. We had, to our great satisfaction, just

over, where we had no towns to lodge, and, indeed, ex-
pected none but the city Jarawena, which we had yet two
days’ march to; the desert, however, had some few woods
in it on this side, and little rivers, which ran all into the
great river Udda; it was in a narrow strait, between little
but very thick woods, that we pitched our camp that
night, expecting to be attacked before morning. As it
was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go about in troops
in that desert, so the caravans always fortify themselves
every night against them, as against armies of robbers ;
and it was, therefore, no new thing to be pursued, But
we had this night a most advantageous camp: for as
we lay between two woods, with a little rivulet run-
ning just before our front, we could not be surround-
ed, or attacked any way but in our front or rear.
We took care also to make our front as strong as we could,
by placing our packs, with the camels and horses, all in a
line, on the inside of the river, and felling some trees in
our rear. _
In this posture we encamped for the night; but the

they would go away, and do us no further harm, other-
wise they would destroy us all. Our men looked very
blank at this message, and began tostare at one another to
see who looked with the most guilt in their faces;
but nobody was the word—nobody did it. The leader
of the caravan sent word he was well assured that
it was not done by any of our camp ; that we were
peaceful merchants, traveling on our business ; that
we had done no harm to them or to any one else .'

in the morning, by break of day, to our camp ; but

at least to the right and rather behind us. So he takes
his bow and arrows, and getting on horseback, he rides
away from our rear directly, as it were back to Nortziousky,
after this he takes a great circuit about, and comes di“
rectly on the arm of the Tartars as if he had been sent
expressly to tell t em a lon story that the people who
had burned the Cham Chi-T aungu were gone to Sibeil-
ka, with a caravan of miscreants, as he called them—that
is to say, Christians ; and that they had resolved to burn
the god Scal-Isar, belonging to the Tonguses. As this
fellow was himself a Tartar,'and perfectly spoke their
language, he counterfeited so well that they all believed
him, and away they drove in a violent hurry to Sibeilka. In
less than three hours they were entirely out of our sight,
and we never heard any more of them, nor whether they
went to Sibeilka or no. So we passed away safely on to
Jarawena, where there was a Russian garrison, and there
484 ROBINSON causes. '
From this city We had a frightful desert, which held us
twenty-three days’ march. We furnished ourselves with
some tents here, for the better accommodating ourselves
in the night ; and the leader of the caravan procured six-
teen wagons of the country, for carrying our water or pro-
visioheosnd these carriages were our defense every night
round r little camp ; so that had the Tartars appeared,
unless they had been very numerous indeed, they would
not have been able to hurt us. We may well be
supposed t0\have wanted rest again after this long
journey ; for hi this desert we neither saw house not
tree, and scarce a bush ; though we saw abundance
of the sable-hunters, who are all Tartars of Mogul
Tartary, of which this country is a part; and they fre-
quently attack small caravans, but we saw‘ no numbers of
them together.
After we had passed this desert we came into acountry
pretty well inhabited-that is to say, we found towns and
castles, settled by the czar with garrisons of stationary
soldiers, to protect the caravans and defend the country
against the Tartars, who would otherwise make very
dangerous traveling; and his czarish majesty has given
such strict orders for the well guarding the caravans,that,
if there are any Tartars heard of in the country, detach~
ments of the garrison are always sent ‘to see the traveler
safe from station to station. Thus the governor of Adin-

the people more civilized; but I found myself mistaken
in both; for we had yet the nation of the Tonguses to pass
through, where we saw the same tokens of paganism and
barbarity as before ; only, as they were conquered by the
Muscovites, they were not so dangerous, but for rudeness
of manners and idolatry no people in the world ever went
beyond them. They are all clothed in skins of beasts, and
that houses are built of the same ; you know not a man
from a woman, neither by the ruggedness of their counte~
nances nor their clothes ; and in the winter, when the
ground is covered with snow, they live underground in
vaults, which have cavities going from one to another. If
the Tartars had their Cham Chi-Thaungu for a whole
village or country, these had idols in every hut and every
cave; This country, I reckon, was, from the desert I spoke
of last, at least four hundred miles, half of it being another


desert, which took us up twelve days’ severe traveling,
without house or tree ; and we were obliged again to
carry our own provisions, as well water and bread. After
we were out of this desert, and had traveled two days,
we came to Janezay, a Muscovite city, or station, on the
great river Janezay, which, they told us there, parted
Europe from Asia. '
All the country between the river Oby and the river
Janezay is as entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous,
as the remotest of the Tartars. I also found, which I ob-
served to the Muscovite governors whom I had an oppor-
tunity to converse with, that the poor pagans are not
much wiser, or nearer Christianity, for being under the
Muscovite government, which they. acknowledged was
true enough—but that, as they said, was none of their
business ; that if the czar expected to convert his
Siberian, Tonguse, or Tartar subjects, it should be done
by sending clergymen among them, not soldiers ; and
they added, with more sincerity than I expected,
that it was not so much the concern of their mon-
arch to make the people Christians as to make them
subjects.
From this river to the Oby we crossed a wild, unculti-
vated country, barren of people and good management,
otherwise it is in itself a pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable
country. What inhabitants we found in it are all pagans,
except such as are sent among them from Russia; for this
is the country-_I mean on both sides the river Oby——
whither the Muscovite criminals that are put to death are
banished, and from whence it is next to impossible they
should ever get away. I have nothing material to say of
my particular affairs till I came to Tobolski, the capital
city of Siberia, where I continued some time on the follow-
ing account:
We had now been almost seven months on our journey,
and winter began to come on apace ; whereupon my part.
ner and I called a. council about our particular affairs, in
which we found it proper, as we were bound for England,
to consider how to dispose of ourselves. They told us of

ing frozen, is one universal covering to nature, by which
the hills,‘vales, rivers, and lakes are all smooth and hard
as a stonemnd they run upon the surface, without any
regard to what is underneath.
But I had no occasion to urge a winter journey of
this kind. I was bound to England, not to Moscow,
and my route lay two ways: either I must go on as '
the caravan went, till I came to Jarislaw, and then go
off west for Narva and the Gulf of Finland, and so on
to Dantzic, where I might possibly sell my China car-
go to good advantage; or I must leave the caravan
at a little town on the Dwina, from whence I had but
six days by water to Archangel, and from thence might
be sure of shipping either to England, Holland, 0r Ham-
bur .
Ngow, to go any of these journeys in the winter would
have been preposterous, for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would
have been frozen up and I could not get passage; and
to go by land in those countries was far less safe than
among the Mogul Tartars ; likewise, as to Archangel in
October, all the ships would be gone from thence,
and even the merchants who dwell there in summer
retire south to Moscow in the winter, when the ships
are gone; so that I could have nothing but extremity
of cold to encounter, with a scarcity of provisions, and
must lie in an empty town all the winter. Therefore,
upon the whole, I thought it much my better way to let
the caravan go, and make provisions to winter where I was,
at Tobolski, in Siberia, in the latitude of about sixty de-
grees, where I was sure of three things to wear out a cold
winter with—viz., plenty of provisions, such as the country
afforded, a warm house, with fuel enough, and excellent
company. '
I was now in quite a different climate from my beloved
island, where I never felt cold, except when I had my
ague ; on the contrary, I had much to do to bear any

Now I had three good vests, with large robes or gowns

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be
possible to meet with good company here, in a country so
barbarous as this—one of the most northernly parts of
Europe. But this being the country where the state crimi-
nals of Muscovy, as I observed before, are all banished,
this city was full of Russian noblemen, gentlemen, soldiers,
and courtiers. Here was the famous Prince Galitzin, the
‘ old German Robostiski, and several other persons of note,
and some ladies. By means of my Scotch merchant,
whom, nevertheless, I parted with here, I made an ac~
quaintance with several of these gentlemen ; and from
these, in the long winter nights in which I stayed here, I
received several very agreeable visits.

with the story, and especially the prince, who told me,
with a sigh, that the true greatness of life was to be mas-
ters of ourselves ; that he would not have exchanged such
a state of life as mine to be Czar of Muscovy ; and that he
- found more felicity in the retirement he seemed to ban~

he enjoyed in the court of his master the czar ; that the
height of human wisdom was to bring our tempers down
to our circumstances, and to make a calm within, under
the weight of the greatest storms without. When he

done before him ; but a little time and consideration had
made him look into himself, as well as round him to things
without: that he found the mind of man, if it was but

and how little this world was concerned in its true felicity,
was perfectly capable of making a felicity for itself fully
satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own best ends and
desires, with but little assistance from the world. That
being now deprived of all the fancied felicity which be en-
joyed in the full exercise of worldly pleasures, he said he
was at leisure to look ut the dark side of them, where he
found all manner of deformity; and was now convinced
that virtue only makes a man truly wise, rich, and great,
and preserves him in the way to a superior happiness in
a future state ; and in this, he said, they were more happy
in their banishment than all their enemies were, who had
full possession of all the wealth and power they had left
behind them. “Now, sir,” says he, “ do I bring my mind
to this politically, from the necessity of my circumstances,
which some call miserable; but,if I know anything of my-
self, I would not now go back, though the czar my mas-
ter should call me, and reinstate me in all my former
grandeur."
He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, so
much earnestness and motion of his spirits, that it was evi_
dent is was the true sense of his soul ; there was no room
to doubt his sincerity. I told him I once thought myself
a kind of monarch in my old station, of which I had given


him an account; but that I thought he was not only a
monarch, but a great conqueror ; for that he had got a
victory over his Own exhorbitant desires, and the abso-
lute dominion over himself, he whose reason entirely
governs his will, is certainly greater than he that conquers

I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful
winter I thought it ; the cold so intense that I could not

It was now March, the days grown considerably longer,

covy or the Baltic, I made no motion ; knowing very well
that the ships from the south‘do not set out for that part
of the world till May or June, and that if I was there by
the beginning of August, it would be as soon as any ships
would be ready to sail. Therefore I made no haste to be
gone, as others did: in a word, I saw a great many people,
nay, all the travelers, go away before me. It seems every
year they go from thence to Muscovy for trade, to carry
furs, and ' buy necessaries, which they bring back with
them to furnish their shops: also others went on the same
errand to Archangel.
In the month of May I began to. make all ready to pack
up ; and, as I was doing this, it occurred to me that, see-
iug all these people were banished by the czar to Siberia,
and yet, when they came there, were left at liberty to go
whither they would, why they did not then go away to

began to examine what should hinder them from making
such an attempt. But my wonder was over when I entered
upon that subject with the person I have mentioned

he, “ the place where we are; and, secondly, the con-
dition we are in; especially the generality of the people
who are banished thither. We are surrounded With
stronger thingswthan bars or bolts ; on the north side, an
unnavigable oc‘ean, where ship never sailed and boat never
swam ; every other way we have above a thousand miles
to pass through the czar’s own dominions, and by ways
utterly impassable, except by the roads made by the gov-
ernment, and through the towns garrisoned by his troops;
in short, we could neither pass undiscovered by the road,
nor subsist any other way, so that it is in vain to attempt it."
I was silenced at once, and found that they were in a
prison every jot as secure as if they had been locked up
in the castle at Moscow : however, it came into my
thoughts that I might certainly be made an instrument to
procure the escape of this excellent person ; and that,
whatever hazard I ran, I would certainly try if I could
carry him off. Upon this, I took an occasion one evening
to tell him my thoughts. I represented to him that it was
very clear for me to carry him away. there being no guard
over him in the country; and as I was not going to Mos-
cow, but to Archangel, and that I went in the retinue of
a caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in the station-
ary-towns in the desert, but could encamp every night
where I would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to
Archangel, where I would immediately secure nin': on
board an English ship, and carry him safe along with me;
and as to his subsistence and other particulars, it should
be my care till he could better supply himself,
He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on
me all the while I spoke; nay, I could see in his very face
that what I said put his spirits into an exceeding ferment;
his color frequently changed, his eyes looked red, and his

countenance; nor could he immediately answer me when I
had done, and, as it were, hesitated what he would say to
it : but after he had paused a little, he embraced me, and
said, “How unhappy are we, unguardedr creatures as we
are, that even our greatest acts of friendship are made
snares unto us, and we are made tempters of one another!"
He then heartily thanked me for my offers of service, but
withstood resolutely the arguments I used to urge him to
set himself free. He declared, in earnest terms, that he
was fully bent on remaining where he was rather than seek
to return to his former miserable greatness, as he called it:
Where the seeds of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury
might revive, take root, and again overwhelm him. “ Let

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and,
stood silent, looking at him, and, indeed, admiring what I
saw. The struggle in his soul was so great, that, though
the weather was extremely cold, it put him into a most
violent heat ; so I said a word or two, that I would leave
him to consider of it, and wait on him again, and then I
withdrew to my own apartment.
About two hours after I heard somebody at ‘or near the
door of my room, and I was going to open the door, but
he had opened it and come in. “ My dear friend," says
he, “you_had almost overset me, but I am recovered. D0

I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make pro-

from a man in his circumstances,and I would have avoided
them, but he would not be refused. The next morning I
sent my servant to his lordship with a small present of tea,
and two pieces of China damask, and four little wedges of
Japan gold, which did not all weigh above six ounces or
thereabouts, but were far short of the value of his sables,
which, when I came to England, I found worth near two
hundred pounds. He accepted the tea, and one piece of
the damask, and one of the pieces of gold, which had a

he took for the rarity of it, but would not take any more;
and he sent word by my servant that he desired to speak
with me.
When I came to him he told me I knew what had
passed between us, and hoped I would not move him any
more in that affair; but that, since I had made such a
generous offer to him, he asked me if Iv had kindness
enough to offer the same to another person that he
would name to me, in whom he had a great share of
concern. In a word, he told me it was his only son; who,
though I had not seen him, was in the same condition with
himself, and above two hundred miles from him, on the
other side of the Oby; but that, if I consented, he would
send for him.
I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. I
made some ceremony in letting him understand that it was


wholly on his account ; and that, seeing I could not pre-
Vail on him, I would show my respect to him by my
concern for his son. ‘He sent the next day for his son;
and in about twenty days he came back with the
messenger, bringing six or seven horses, loaded with
very rich furs, which, on the whole, amounted to a

his father presented him to me; and, in short, we concerted
the manner of our traveling, and everything proper for
the journey. ,

here.
It was the beginning of June when I left this remote
place. We were now reduced to a very small caravan,
having only thirty-two horses and camels in all, which
passed for mine, though my new guest was proprietor of
eleven of them. It was natural also that I should take
more servants with me than I had before ; and the young
lord passed for my steward ; what great man I passed for
myself I know not, neither did it concern me to inquire.
We had here the worst and the largest desert to pass over
that we met with in our whole journey; I call it the worst,
because the way was very deep in some places, and very
uneven in others ; the best we had to say for it was, that
we thought We had no troops of Tartars, or robbers to
fear, as they never came on this side of the river Oby, or
at least very seldom; but we found it otherwise.
My young lord had a faithful Siberian servant, who was
perfectly acquainted with the country, and led us by priv-
ate roads, so that we avoided Coming into the principal
towns and cities upon the great road, such as Tumen,
Soloy Kamaskoy, and several others; because the Musco-
vite garrisons which are kept there are very curious and
strict in their observance upon travelers, and searching
lest any of the banished persons of note should make their
escape that way into Muscovy ; but, by this means, as we
were kept out of the cities, so our whole journey was a
desert, and we were obliged to encamp and lie in our
tents, when we might have had very good accommodation
in the cities on the way; this the young 10rd was so sensi-
ble of, that he would not allow us to lie abroad when we
came to several cities on the way, but lay abroad himself,
with his servant, in the woods, and met us always at the
appointed places.
We had just entered Europe, having passed the river
Kama, which in these parts is the boundary between

was called Soloy Kamaskoy, that is, the great city on the
river Kama. And here we thought to see some evident
alteration in the people; but we were mistaken ; for as we
had a vast desert to pass, which is near'seven hundred
miles long in some places, butv not above two hundred
miles over where we passed it, so, till we came past that
horrible place, we found very little difference between
that country and Mogul Tartary. The people are mostly
pagans; their houses and towns full of idols; and their way
of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities and vil-
lages near them, where they are Christians, as they call
themselves, of the Greek Church : but have their religion
mingled with so many relics of superstition, that it is
scarce to be known in some places from mere sorcery and
witchcraft.
In passing this forest (after all our dangers were, to our
imagination, escaped), I thought, indeed, we must have
been plundered and robbed, and perhaps murdered, by a
troop of thieves: of what country they were I am yet at a
loss to know; but they were all on horseback, carried bows
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 495
They came so near to us as to be within two musket shot,
and, asking no questions, surrounded us with their horses,
and looked very earnestly upon us twice ; at length, they
placed themselves just in our way ; upon which we drew
up in a little line, before our camels, being not above‘six-
teen men in all. Thus drawn up, we halted, and sent out
the Siberian servant, who attended his 10rd, to see who

they were ; his master was the more willing to let him go,
because he was not a little apprehensive that they were a
Siberian troop sent out after him. The man came up near

he spoke several of their languages, or dialects of lan-
guages rather, he could not understand a word they said;
however, after some signs to him not to come near them
at his peril, the fellow came back no wiser than he went;
only that by their dress, he said, he believed them to be
some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Circassian hordes,
and that there must be more of them upon the great des-
ert, though he never heard that any of them were seen so
far north before.
This was small comfort to us ; however, we had no
remedy: there was on our left hand, at about a quarter of
a mile distance, a little grove, and very near the road. I
immediately resolved we should advance to those trees,

considered that the trees wouldjin a great measure cover
us from their arrows; and, in the next place, they could not
Come to charge us in a body : it was, indeed, my old Por-
tuguese pilot who proposed it, and who had this excellency
attending him, that he was always readiest and most apt
to direct and encourage us in cases of the most danger.
We advanced immediately, with what speed we could, and
gained that little wood ; the Tartars, or thieves, for we
knew not what to call them, keeping their stand, and not
attempting to hinder us. When we came thither, we
found, to our great satisfaction, that it was a swampy
piece of ground, and on the one side a very great spring
of water, which, running out in a little brook, was a
little further joined by another of the like size ; and
was, in short, the source of a considerable river, called
afterward the Wirtska; the trees which grew about this
spring were not above two hundred, but very large, and
stood pretty thick, so that as soon as we got in, we saw
ourselves perfectly safe from the enemy unless they at-
tacked us on foot.
While we stayed here waiting the motion of the enemy
some hours, without perceiving that they made any move-
ment, our Portuguese, with some help, out several arms
of trees half off, and laid them hanging across from one
tree to another, and in a manner fenced us in. About two

and though we had not perceived it, we found they had

what they wanted, and bade them keep off ; but they

us, and rode round our little wood to see where they might

they went off again; and we resolved not to stir for that
night.
We slept little, but spent the most part of the night
in strengthening our situation, and barricading the en-
trances into the wood, and keeping a strict watch. We
waited for daylight, and when it came, it gave us a
very unwelcome discovery indeed; for the enemy, who
we thought were discouraged with the reception they
met with, were now greatly increased, and had set up
eleven or twelve huts or tents, as if they were resolved to
besiege us ; and this little camp they had pitched upon

were able to resist them all in the situation we were then
in. Thus we spent the day in debates of what we should
do ; but toward evening we found that the number of our
enemies still increased, and we did not know but by the
morning they might still be a greater number : so I be-
gan to inquire of those people we had brought from Tobol-
ski if there were no private ways by which we might avoid
them in the night, and perhaps retreat to some town, or
get help to guard us over the desert. The young lord‘s

orders, he would lose his life if he did not perform it ; we
soon brought his lord to give that order, though privately,

We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the
arrival of the ships, and must have tarried longer, had not
a Hamburgher come in above a month sooner than any of
the English ships; when, after some consideration that the
city of Hamburgh might happen to be as good a market
for our goods as London, we all took freight with him;

the time we stayed there ; and this he did that he might
not be seen in the city, where some of the Moscow mere

We then set sail for Archangel the 20th of August, the
same year; and, after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived
safe in the Elbe the 18th of September. Here my partner
and I found a very good sale for our goods, as well those
of China as the sables, etc., of Siberia: and, dividing the

Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went
up the Elbe, in order to go to the court of Vienna,
where he resolved to seek protection, and could cor-
respond with those of his father’s friends who were left
alive. He did not part without testimonials of gratitude
for the service I had done him, and for my kindness to
the prince, his father.
To conclude: having stayed near four months in Ham-
burgh, I came from thence by land to the Hague, where
I embarked in the packet, and arrived in London the
10th of January 1705, having been absent from Eng-

he had married my mother, whose relations were named
Robinson, a very good family in that country, and after
whom I was so called, that is to say, Robinson Kreutznaer;
but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we are
now called, nay, we call ourselves, and write our name,
Crusoe; and so my com anions always called me.
I had two elder brot ers, one of whom was lieutenant-
colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, former-
ly commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was
killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards.

competent share of learning, as far as house education and
a country free school generally go, and designed me for the

the will, nay, the commands of my father, and against all
the entreaties and persuasion of my mother and other
‘friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that

M father. '\ wise and grave man, gave me serious and
exce lent counsel against what he foresaw was my design.
He called me one morning into his chamber,‘where he was
contiried by the gout, and ex ostulated very warmly with
me upon this subject: he as ed me what reasons, more
shun a mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving his
douse, and my native country, where I might be well in-
srod used, and had a prospect of raising my fortune, by a -

told me it was men of desperate fortunes, on one hand, or
of superior fortunes, on t a other, who went abroad upon
> adventures, aspiring to rise by enterprise, and make them-
selves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the com-
. mon road; that these things were all either too far above
me, or too far below me; that mine was the middle state,
or what might be called the upper station of low life,
which he had found, by long experience, was the best state
in the world, the most suited to human hap iness; not ex-
osed to the miseries and hardships, the la )0!“ and suffer-
ings, of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embar-
rassed .with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the
upper part of mankind: he told me, 1 might judge of the
happiness of this state by one thing, viz., ‘ that this was the
state of life which all other people envied; that kings have
frequently lamented the miserable consequences of being
- born to great things, and wished they had been placed in
the middle of two extremes, between the niean and the
great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this as the
just standard of true felicity, when he prayed to have

on the other hand, bring distempers upon themselves by
the natural consequences of their way of living; that the
middle station of hie was calculated for all kind of virtues,
and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were
the handmaids of a middle fortune; that temperance,
moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable diver-
sions, and all desirable pleasures were the blessings attend'
ing the middle station of life; that/this way men went
silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably
out of it, not embarrassed with the labors of the hands or
of the head, not sold to the life of slavery for daily bread,
or harassed with perplexed circumstances, which rob the
soul of peace, and the body of rest; not enraged with the
passion of envy, or secret burning lust of ambition for
great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently
through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets o! liv-
ing, without the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and
learning by every day’s experience to know it more
sensibly.

precipitate myself into miseries which nature, and the
station of life I was born in, seemed to have provided
against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread;
that he would do well for me, and endeavor to enter me
fairly into the station of life which he had been just recom-
mending to me; and that if 1 was not very easy and happy
in the world, it must be my more fate, or fault, that must
hinder it; and that he should have nothing to answer for,
having thus discharged his duty in warning me against
measures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word,
that as he would do very kind things for me if I would stay
and settle at home as he directed, so he would not have so
much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encour--
agement to go away; and, to close all, he told me 1 had
my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the
same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the
Low Country wars; but could not prevail, his young de~
'sires prom ting him to run into the army, where he was
killed; an though, he said, he would not cease to pray for
me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take
this foolish step, God would not bless me; and I would

recovery.
I observed, in this last part of his discourse, which was
truly prophetic, though, I. suppose, myjather did not know
it to be so himself; I say, I observed the tears run down
his face very plentifully, especially when he spoke of my
brother who was killed; and that, when he spoke of my
having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so
moved, that he broke off the discourse, and told me his
heart was so full he could say no more to me.
1 was sincerely affected with this discourse; as, indeed,
{who could be otherwise? and I resolved not to think of go-
ing abroad any more, but to settle at home, according to
my father’s desire. But alas! a few days were it all ed:

than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so on-
tirely bent upon seeing the world, that I should never settle
to anything with resolution enough to go through‘with it,
and my father had better give me his consent than force
me to go without it; that l was now eighteen years old,
which was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to
an attorney; that 1 was sure, if I did, I should never serve
out my time, and 1 should certainly run away from my
master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she
would speak to my father to let me make but one voyage
abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, I would
go no mere; and I would promise by a double diligence, to
recover the time I had lost. , y
This put my mother into a great passion; she told me
she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father
upon any such a subject; that he knew toowell what was
my interest to give his consent to anything so much for my
hurt; and that she wondered how could think of any
such thing, after such a discourse as I had from my father,
and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my
father had used to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin
myself, there was no help for me; but I might depend]

she would not have so much hand in my destruction; and

it, said to her with a sigh, That boy might be happy if he
would stay at home; but if he goes abroad, he will be the
most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give no
consent to it.
It was not till almost a year after this tha‘ I broke loose;
though in the meantime I continued obstinately deaf to all
proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulat-
ing with my father and mother about their being so posi-
tively determined against what they knew my inclinations
prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, whither I
went casually, and without any purpose of making an
elopement at that time, and one of my companions then
going to London by sea in his father’s ship, and prompting
me to go with them by the common allurement of seafar-
ing men, viz., that it should cost me nothing for my pass-
age, I consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor
so much as sent them word of it; but left them to hear of
it as they might, without asking God’s blessing, or my
father’s, without any consideration of circumstances or
consequences, and in an ill hour, God knows;

SECTION 11.
First Adventures at Sea, and Experience of s Maritime Life—Voy-
age to Guinea. -
ON the 1st of September, 1651, I went on board a ship
bound for London. Never any young adventurer’s mis-
fortunes, I believe, began younger, or continued longer,
than mine. The ship had no sooner got out of the Hum-
ber, than the wind began to blow, and the waves to rise,
in a most frightful manner; and as I had never been at sea

done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of
Heaven for wickedly leaving my father’s house. All the
good eounsels of my parents, my father’s tears, and my
mother’s entreaties, came new fresh into my mind; and
my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of
hardness to which it has been since, reproaohed me with
the contempt of advice and the abandonment of my dut .
All this while the storm increased, and the sea, whi I
/
had never been upon before, went veryr high, though noth-
ing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor what
I saw a few days after; but, such as it Was, enough to
affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and had never
known anything Qf the matter. 1 expected every wave
wnuld have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship
fell down, as I thought, in the trough or hollow of the sea,
" we should never rise more; and in this agony of mind I
made many vows and resolutions, that if it would please
God to spare my life this voyage, if ever 1 got my foot once
on dry land, I would go directly home to my father, and
never set it into a ship again while I lived; that I would
take his advice, and never run myself into such miseries as
these any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of his
observations about the middle station of life; how easy,
how comfortable, he had lived all his days, and never had
been exposed to tempests at sea or troubles on shore; and
I resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go
home to my father.
These . wise and sober thoughts continued during the
storm, and indeed some time after; but the next day, as
the wind was abated, and the sea calmer, I began to be a
little inured to it. However, I was very grave that day,
being also a little sea-sick still; but toward night the

no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining u on it, the
sight was, as I thought, the most delightful t at I ever
saw.
1 had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-
sick. but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea
that was so rough and terrible the day before, and could be
so calm and pleasant in a little time after.
,And now, lest my good resolutions should continue, my
companion, who had indeed enticed me away, came to me,
and said, Well, Bob, clapping me on the shoulder, how do
you do after it? I warrant you you were frightened,
wa’n’t you, last night, when it blew but a capful of wind?
——A capful, do you call it? said I; ’twas a terrible storm.
—A storm, you fool! replies he, do you call that a storm?
Why, ’it was nothing at all; give us but a good ship, and
sea-room, and we think nothing of such a squall of wind as
that: you are but a fresh—Water sailor, rich; come, let us
make a bowl of punch, and we’ll forget all that. D’ye see
what charming weather he now? To make short this sad
part of my story, we went the way of all sailors; the punch
was made, and I was made drunk with it; add in that one
night’s wickedness i drowned all my repentance, all my re-
flections upon my past conduct, and all my resolutions for
the future. In a word, as the sea was returned to its
smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the abate-
ment of the storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being
over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by
the sea forgotten, and the current of my former desires re-
turned, I entirely forgot'the vows and promises I had made

myself from them, as it were from a distemper, and, ap-

or six days got as complete a victory over conscience as any
young sinner, that resolved not to be troubled with it,
could desire. But 1 was to have another trial for it still;
and Providence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved
to leave me entirely without excuse: for if I would not take
this for a deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the
worst and most hardened wretch among us would confess
both the danger and the mercy of. The sixth day of our
being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind hav-
ing been contrary and the weather calm, We had made but
little way since the storm. Here we were obliged to come
to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing con-
trary, viz., at south-west, for seven or eight days, during
which time a great many ships from Newcastle came into
the same roads, as the common harbor where the ships
might wait for a wind for the River Thames. We had not,
however, rid here so long, but we should have tided up the
river, but that the wind blew too fresh; and, after we had

earned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but
spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the
sea. But the eighth day, in pigs. mgrning, the wind‘ in-
creased, and we had all hands at work to trike our top-
masts, and make everything snug and close, that the ship
might ride as easy as possible. ' By noon the sea went very
high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle in, shipped several
seas, and we thought, once or twice, our anchor had come
home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet
anchor; so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the
cables veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I
began to see terror and amazement in the faces of even the
seamen themselves. The master was vigilant in the busi-
ness of preserving the shi ; but, as he went in and out of
his cabin by me, I coul hear him softly say to himself

himself came by me, as I said just now, and said we should
be all lost, I was dreadfully frightened. I got .up out of
my cabin, and looked out; but such a dismal sight 1 never
saw; the sea went mountains high, and broke u on us
every three or four minutes. When I could look 8 out, I
could see nothing but distress around us; two ships, that
rid near us, we found had cut their masts by the board,
being deeply laden; and our men cried out that a ship
which rid abOut a mile ahead of us was foundered. Two
more ships, being driven from their anchors, were run out
of the roads to sea, at all adventures, and that with not a
mast standing. The light ships fared the best, as not so
much laboring in the sea; but two or three of them drove,
and came close by us, running away, with only their sprit-
sails out, before the wind. Toward evening, the mate and
boatswain begged the master of our ship to let them cut
away the foremast, which he was very loath to do; but the
boatswain protesting to him, that if he did not, the ship
would founder, he consented; and when they had cut away
the foremast, the mainmast stood so loose, and shook the
ship so much, they were obliged to cut it away also, and
make a clear deck.
Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all
this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such
a fright before at but a little. But if I can express, at this
distance, the thoughts 1 had about me at that time, I was
in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former
convictions, and the having returned from them to the res-

itself; and these, added to the terror of the storm, put me
into such a condition that I can by no words describe it.
But the worst Was not come yet ; the storm continued with
such fury that the seamen themselves acknowledged they
had never known a worse. We had a good ship, but she
was deep laden, and so wallowed in the sea, that the sea-
men every now and then cried out she would founder. It
was my advantage, in one respect that 1 did not know what
they meant by founder, till I inquired. However, the
storm was so violent that 1 saw, what is not often seen, the
master, the boatswain, and some others, more sensible than
the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every moment the
chi would go to the bottom. 1n the middle of the night,
an under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men,
that had been down on purpose to see, cried out, we had
a rung a leak; another said there was four feet of water in
t e hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At
that ver word my heart, as I thought, died within me,
and 1 fe backward upon the side of my bed, where I sat
in the cabin. However, the men roued me, and told me
that I, who was able to do nothing before, was as well able
to pump as another: at which 1 stirred up and went to the
pump, and worked very heartily. While this was doing,

out the storm, were obliged to slip and run away to sea,

signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what that meant,
was so surprised, that I thought the ship had broke, or
some dreadful thing had happened. In a word, I was so
surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time
when everybody had his own life to think of, no one mind-
ed me, or what was become of me: but another man
stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his
foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead; and it was a
t while before I came to myself.

was apparent that the ship would founder; and though the

It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us, but
it was impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to
lie near the ship’s side; till at last the men rowing Very
heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our men
cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, and then
veered it out a great length, which they, after great labor
and hazard, took hold. of, and we hauled them close under
our stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no pur-
pose for them or us, after we were in the boat, to think of
reaching their own ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and
only to pull her in toward shore as much as we could; and
our master promised them, that if the boat was staved
upon shore, he would make it good to their master; so,
partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went away to
the northward, sloping toward the shore almost as far as
Winterton-Ness. '
We were not ‘mueh more than a quarter of an hour out
of our ship when we saw her sink; and then I understood,

1up when the seamen told me she was sinking; for, from
that moment, they rather put me into the boat, than that
1 might be said to go in. My heart was, as it were, dead
' within me, partly with fright, partly with horror of mind,
and the thoughts of what was yet beiore me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet laboring at
the oar to bring the boat near the shore, we could see
(when, our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see
the shore) a great many people running along the strand,
to assist us when we should come near; but we made slow
way toward the shore; nor were we able to reach it, till.
being past the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls off
to the westward, toward Cromer, and so the land broke 011
a little the violence of the wind. Here we got in, and,
though not without much difficulty, got all safe on shore,
and walked afterward on foot to Yarmouth; where, as un-
fortunate men, we were used with great humanity, as well
by the magistrates of the town, who assigned as good
uarterl, as by the particular merchants and owners of

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and
have gone home, I had been happy: and my father, an
emblem of our blessed Saviour’s parable, had even killed
the fatted calf for me; for, hearing the ship I went in was
"cast away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before
{ he had any assurance that I was not drowned. \
I But my ill fate pushed me on with an obstinacy that
nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud

to go home, yet I had no power to do it.—l know not what
.to call this, nor willI urge that it is a secret, overruling
decree, that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own
destruction, even though it be before us, and that We rush
upon it with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some
such decreed unavoidable misery attending, and which it
was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed me
forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my
most retired thoughts, and against two such visible instruc-

melaneho y, and shaking his head, he asked me how I did;
telling his father who I was, and how I had come this voy-
3lge only for a trial, in order to go further abroad. His
lather, turning to me, with a grave and concerned tone,
,Young man, says be, you ought never to go to sea any
lmore; you ought to take this for a plain and visible token,
' that you are not to be a seafaring man. —-Why, sir? said I ;
will you go to sea no moreP—That is another case, said he;
it is my calling, and therefore my duty; but as you made
this voyage for a trial, you see what a taste Heaven has
given you of what you are to expect if you persist. Per-
aps this has all befallen us on your account, like Jonah in
the ship of Tarshish.-Pray, continues he, what are you,
and on what account did you go to sea? U on that I told
him some of my Astg'yi "at the_end_o£ whic he burst out
with a strange kind of passion. What had I done, said he,
that such an unhappy wreteh should come into my ship?
I would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again
for a thousand pounds. This indeed was, as 1 said, an ex-
cursion of his spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense
of his loss, and was further than he could have authority
to go.——However, he afterward talked very gravely to me;
exhorted me to go back to my father, and not tempt Provi-
dence to my ruin; told me, I might see a visible hand of
Heaven against me; and, young man, saidhe, depend upon
it, if you do not go back, wherever you go, you will meet
with nothing but disasters and disappointments, till your

We parted soon after, for 1 made him little answer, an
I saw him no more; which way he went, I know not; as
for me, having some money in my pocket, I traveled to
London by land; and there, as well as on the road, had
many strug les with myself what course of life I should
take, and whether I should go home or go to sea. As to
going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered
to my thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me how I
should be laughed at among the neighbors, and should be
ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even
everybody else. From whence I have often since observed,
how incongruous and irrational the common temper of
mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason which ought
to guide them in such cases, viz., that they are not
ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not
ashamed of the action, for which they ought justly to be
esteemed fools; but are ashamed of the returning, which
only can make them be esteemed wise men.
In this state of life, however, I remained some time, un-
certain what measures to take, and what course of life to
lead. An irresistible reluctance continued to going home;
and as I stayed awhile, the remembrance of the distress I
had been in wore off; and as that abated, the little motion
1 had in my desires to a return wore off with it, till at last
- I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a

from my father’s house, that hurried me into the wild and

I WAS now set up for a Guinea trader, and my friend,
to my great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I re-

However, to cut short this melancholy part of our story, ‘

Heaven had overtaken me, and I Was undone, without re-

was to go through, as will appear in the sequel of this
story.
As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his
house, so I was in hopes he would take me with him when
he went to sea again, believing that it would, some time or
other, be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese
man-of-war, and that thenI should be set at liberty. But
this hope of mine was soon taken away, for when he went
to sea he left me on shore to look after his little garden, and
do the common drudgery of slaves about his house, and when
he came home again from his cruise, he ordered‘me to lie
in the cabin, to look after the ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what

had the least probability in it. Nothing presented to
make the supposition of it rational; for I had nobody to
communicate it to that would embark with me, no fellow-
slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or Seotchman there but
myself; so that for two years, though I often pleased my-
self with the imagination, yet I never had the least encour-
aging prospect of putting it in practice.
After about two years, an odd circumstance presented
itself, which put the 01d thought of making some attempt
for my liberty again in my head. My patron lying at

calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we were
not half a league from the shore, we lost sight of it; and
rowing, we knew not whither, or which way, we labored
all day and all the next night, and when the morning
came, we found we had pulled off to sea, instead of pull-
ing in for the shore, and that we were at least two leagues
from the shore; however, we get well in again, though
with a great deal of labor, and some danger, for the wind
began to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but particular-
1y we were all very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take
more care of himself for the future; and having lying by
him the long-boat of our English ship he had taken, he re-
solved he would not go a-fishing any more without a com-
pass and some provision; so he ordered the carpenter of
the ship, who was an English slave, to build a little state-
room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat, like that of a
barge, with a place to stand behind it, to steer and haul
home the main sheet, and room before for a hand or two
to stand and work the sails. She sailed with what we-

for I told him we must not presume to eat of our patron ’s

lump of beeswax into the boat, which weighed show halt
a hundredweight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a
hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which were of great use
to us afterward, especially the wax, to make candles. An-
other trick I tried upon him, which he innocently came
into also; his name was Ismael, whom they call Muley, or
Moley; so I called to him. Moley, said 1, our patron’s guns
are on board the boat; can you not get a little powder and
shot? it may be we may kill some alcamies (fowls like our
curlews) for ourselves, for 1 know he keeps the gunner’r

accordingly he brought a great leather pouch, which held

that he might not see them, I said to the Moor: This Wlll

the head of the boat, set the sails; and as I had the helm,

stepped forward to where the Moor was, and I took him .
by surprise, with my arm under his waist, and tossed him
clear overboard into the sea. He rose immediately, for he
swam like a cork, and called to me, begged to be taken in,
and told me he would go all the world over with me. He
swam so strong after the boat, that he would have reached
me very quickly, there being but little wind; upon which
\
I stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-
pieces, I presented it at him, and told him I had done him
no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would do him none.
'J/But, said I, you swim well enough to reach the shore, and
the sea is calm; make the best of yOur way to shore, and I
' will do you no harm; but if you come near the boat I will
shoot you through the head; for I am resolved to have my
liberty. So he turned himself about, and swam for the
shore, and 1 make no doubt but he reached it with ease,
for he was an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor with
me and have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing
to trust him; When he was gone I turned to the boy,
whom they called Xury, and said to him: Xury, if you
will be faithful to me I will make you a great man; but if
you will not stroke your face to be true to me (that is,
swear by Mahomet and his father’s beard), I must throw
you into the sea too. The boy smiled in my face, and
spoke so innocently, that I could not mistrust him, and
swore to'be faithful to me and go all over the world with
me. ‘
While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I
stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching“ to
windward, that they might think me gone toward the
strait’s mouth (as indeed any one that had been in their
wits must have been supposed to do); for who would have
supposed we were sailing on to the southward, to the truly
Barbarian coast, where whole nations of negroes were sure
to surround us with their canoes and destroy us; where we
could never once go on shore but we should be devoured
£y savage beasts, or more merciless savages of human
in .
But as seen as it grew dusk in the evening I changed my
course, and steered directly south and by east, bending my
course a little toward the east, that I might keep in with
the shore; and having a fair, fresh gale of wind, and a
smooth, quiet sea, I made such sail that I believe by the
next day, at three o’clock in the aiternoon, when I made

ward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels were in
chase of me, they also would now give over; so I ventured
to make to the coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth
of a little river; I knew not what or where, neither what
latitude, what country, what nation, or what river. I
neither saw, nor desired to see, any people; the rincipal
thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek
in the evening, revolving to swim on shore as soon as it was
dark, and discovet .he country; but as soon as it was quite
dark we heard such dreadful noises of the barking, roar-
ing, and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not what
kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and
begged of me not to' go on shore till day. Well, Xury,
said I, then I will not; but it may be we may see men by
day, who will be as bad to us as those lions. Then we may
give them the shoot-gun, says Xury, laughing; make
them run away. Such English Xury spoke by conversing
among us slaves. However, 1 was glad to see the boy so
cheerful, and I gave him a dram out of our patron’s case
of bottles to cheer him up. After all, Xury’s advice was
good, and I took it. We dropped Our little anchor, and
lay still all night; 1 say still, for we slept none; for in two
or three hours we saw vast creatures (we knew not what to
call them), of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore, and
run into the water, wallowing and washing themselves, for
the pleasure of cooling themselves, and they made such
hideous howlings and yellings, that I never indeed heard
the like.
Xury was dreadfully fri htened, and indeed so was I too;
but We were both ‘more rightened when we heard one of
these mighty creatures swimming toward our boat; we
could not see him, but we might hear him, by his blowing,
to be a monstrous, huge, and furious beast. Xury said it
was a lion, and it might be so, for aught I know; but poor
Xury cried to me to weigh the anchor and row away. No,
says I, Xury; we can slip our cable with a buoy to it. and
go off to sea; they can not follow us far. I had no sooner
said so, but 1 perceived the creature (whatever it was)
within two oars’ length, which something surprised me;
however, 1 immediately stepped to the cabin door, and

atelv turned about, and swam to the shore again.
But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises and
hideous'cries and howlings that were raised, as well upon
the edge of the shore as higher within the country, upon
the noise! or report of the an; a thing, I believe, those
creatures had never 'heard efore. This convinced me
there was no going on shore for us in the night upon that
coast; and how to venture on shore in the day, was another
question too; for to have fallen into tbehands of any of
the savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into the
awe of lions and tigers; at least, we were equally appre-
ensive of the danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore
somewhere or other for water, for we had not a pint left in
the boat; when and where to get it was the point. Xury
said if I would let him go on shore with one of the jars, he-
ROBINSON causes. 25
I asked him why he would go, why I should not go, and he
stay in the boat. The boy answered with so much affec-
tion that he made me love him ever after. Says he, 11
wild mans come, they eat me, you go away. Well, Xury,
said I, we Wlll both go; and if the wild mans come, we
will kill them; they shall eat neither of us. So I gave
Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat and a dram out of our
patron’s case of bottles, which I mentioned before; and we
auled in the boat as near the shore as we thought was
proper, and so waded to shore, carrying nothing but our
arms, and two jars for water.
_ I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the
, coming of canoes with savages down the river; but the
boy, seeing a low place about a mile up the country, ram~
bled 'to it; and by and by 1 saw him come running toward
me. I thought he was pursued by some savage, or fright
ened by some wild beast, and 1 therefore ran forwaru to
help him; but when I came nearer to him, I saw some-
thing hanging over his shoulders, which was a creature
that he had shot, like a hare, but different in color, and
longer legs; however, we were very glad of it, and it was
very good meat; but the great joy that poor Xury came
with was to tell me he had found good water and seen no
wild mans. ~
But we found afterward that we need not take such pains
for water; for a little higher up the‘creek where we were,
we found the water fresh when the tide was out, which

latitude we were in, and did not exactly know, or at least
remember, what latitude they were in, I knew not where
to look for them, or when to stand off to sea toward them,
otherwise I might now have easily found some of these
islands. But my hope was that if I stood along this coast -

that would relieve and take us in.
By the best of my calculation, the place where I now
was, must be that country which, lying between the Em-
peror of Morocco’s dominions and the Negroes, lies waste
and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the Negroes hav-
ing abandoned it, and gone further south, for fear of the
Moors, and the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by
reason of its barrenness; and, indeed both forsaking it be-
cause of the prodigious number of tigers, lions, leopards,
and other furious creatures which harbor there, so that the
Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go like an
army, two or three thousand men at a time; and, indeed,
for near a hundred miles together upon this coast, we saw
nothing but a waste, uninhabited country by day, and
heard nothing but howlings and roaring of wild beasts by
ni ht.
gOnce or twice, in the day-time, I thought I saw the P100
of Tenerilie, being the top of the mountain of Teneritl‘e,
in the Canaries, and had a great mind to venture out, in
hopes of reaching thither; but having tried twice, I was

design, and keep along the shore.
Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after
we had left this place; and once, in particular, being early
in the morning, we came to an anchor under a little point
of land which was pretty high; and the tide beginning to

more about him than, it seems, mine were, calls softly to

inted, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was a
terrible great lion, that lay on the side of the shore, under
the shade of a piece of the hill, that hung, as it were, over
him. Xury, says I, you shall go on shore and kill him.
Xury looked frightened, and said, Me kill! he eat me at
one mouth; one mouthful he meant. However, I said no
more to the boy, but bade him be still; and I took our
biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and loaded it
with a good charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid
' it down; then I loaded another gun with tW0 bullets; and

again and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to
see him drop, and make but little noise, but lie struggling
for life. Then Xury took heart, and would have me let
him go on shore. Well, go, said I; so the boy jumped
into the water, and taking a little gunin one hand, swam
to shore with the other hand, and coming close to the creat-
ure, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him in
the head again, which dispatched him quite. ‘
This was game, indeed, to us, but it was no food; and l
was very sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot
upon a creature that was good for nothing to us. How-
ever, Xury said he would have some of him; so he comes
on board, 'and asked me to give him the hatchet: For
what, Xury? said I. Me out 01f his head, said he. How-
ever, Xury could not cut oil his head; but he cut off a
bot, and brought it with,_him,' and it was a monstrous
great one. I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the
skin of him might one way or other, be of some value to
us; and I resolved to take elf his skin, if I could. So
Xury and I went to work with him: but Xury was much
the better workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it.
Indeed, it took us both up the whole day; but at last we
got oif the hide of him, and spreading it on the top of our
cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two days’ time, and it
afterward served me to lie upon.
After this stop we made on to the southward continual-
ly, for ten or twelve days, living very sparingly on our
provisions, which began to abate very much, and going no
oftener into the shore than we were obliged to for fresh,
water. My design in this, was to make the River Gambia,
or Senegal: that is to say, anywhere about the Cape de
Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some European
. ship; and if I did not, I knew not what course I had to
take, but to seek for the islands or perish among the
Negroes. I knew that all the ships from Europe, which
sailed either to the coast of Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the
East Indies, made this Cape, or these islands: and in a
word I put the whole of'my fortune upon this single
point, either that I must meet with some ship, or must
erish. .
When I had pursued this resolution about ten days
longer, as I have said, I began to see that the land was in-
habited; and in two or three places, as we sailed by, we
saw people stand upon the shore to look at us: we could
also perceive they were quite black and stark naked. I was
once inclined to have gone on shore to them; but Xury
was my better counselor, and said to me: No go, no go. *
However, I hauled in nearer the shore, that I might talk
to them; and I found they ran along the shore by me a
good way. I observed they had no weapons in their hands,
except one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury said
‘was a lance, and that they would throw them a great way
with good aim; so I kept at a distance, but talked to them
by signs, as well as 1 could, and particularly made signs
for something to eat. They beckoned to me to stop my
boat, and they would fetch me some meat: upon this I
lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and two of them
ran a into the country; and in less than half an hour

at about two leagues from the land, I saw plainly land on
the other side, to seaward: then I concluded, as it was
most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and
those the islands, called, from thence, Cape de Verd
Islands. However, they were at a great distance, and I
could not well tell what I had best to do; for if 1 should
be taken with a gale of wind, I might neither reach one
nor the other.
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into
the cabin, and eat me down, Xury having the helm; when,
on a sudden, the boy cried out, master, master, a ship with
a sail! and the foolish boy was frightened out of his wits,
thinking it mut needs be some of his master’s ships sent
to pursue us, when I knew we were got far enough out of
their reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately
saw, not only the ship, but what she was, viz., that it was
a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound to the
coast of Guinea, for Negroes. But, when I observed the
course she steered, I was soon convinced they were bound
some other way, and did not design to come any nearer to
the shore; upon which, Lstretched out to sea as much as I
could, resolvrng to speak with them, if possible.
With all the sail I could make, 1 found I should not be
able to come in their way, but that they would be gone by
before I could make any signal to them; but after I had
crowded to the utmost, and began _to despair, they, it
seems, saw me, by the help of their perspective glasses,
vand that it was some European boat, which, they sup-
posed, must belong to some ship that was lost: so they
shortened sail, to let me come up. I was encouraged with
this, and as 1 had my patron’s ensign on board, I made a

both which they saw; for they told me they saw the smoke,
though they did not hear the gun. Upon these signals,
they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me; and in
about three hours’ time I came up With them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in
Spanish, and in French, but I understood none of them;
but, at last, a Scotch sailor who was on board, called to.
me, and I answered him, and told him I was an English-l
man, that 1 had made my escape out of slaver from the]
Moors, at Sallee: they then bade me come on board, and
very kindly took me in, and all my goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will
believe, that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from
such a miserable, and almost hopeless, condition as 1 was
in; and I immediately offered all 1 had to the captain of
the ship, as a return for my deliverance; but he generously
told me, he would take nothing from me, but that all I
had should be delivered safe to me,ywhen 1 came tothe
Brazils. For, says he, I have saved your life on no other
terms than I would be glad to be saved myself; and it
may, one time or other, be m lot to be taken up in the
same condition. Besides, said lie, when I carry you to the
Brazils, so great a way from your own country, if 1 should
take from you what you have, you will be starved there,
and then I only take away that life 1 had iven. No, no,
Senhor lngles (Mr. Englishman), says he, I will carry you
thither in charity, and these things will help to buy your
subsistence there, and your passage home again. .

took everything into his own possession, and gave me back
an exact inventory of them, that I might have them, even
so much as, my three earthen jars.
As to my boat, it was a very good one; and that he saw,
and told me he would buy it of me for the shi ’s use; and
asked me what 1 would have for it? I told im, he had
been so generous to me in everything, that 1 could not
offer to make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to
him: upon which, he told me he would give me a note of

eight more for my boy Xury, which 1 was loath to take;
not that 1 was not willing-t0 let the ca tain have him, but
I was very loath to sell the poor boy’s iberty, who had as-
sisted me so faithfully in procuring my own. However,
when I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just,
and offered me this medium, that he would give the boy an
obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned Christ-
ian; upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to
him, I left the captain have him.
We had a ver good voyasge to the Brazils, and arrived
in the Bay de odos 10s autos, or All Saints’ Bay, in
¢
about twenty-two days after. And now 1 was once more
delivered from the most miserable of all conditions of life;
and what to do next with myself, I was now to consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never
enough remember: he would take nothing of me for my
passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leupard’s skin, and
forty for the lion’s skin, which I had in my boat, and
caused everything I had in the ship to be punctually de-
livered to me; and what I was willing to sell, he bought of
me; such as the case .of bottles, two of my guns, and a
piece of the lump of hees-wax—for I had made candles of
the‘rest: in a word, 1 made about two hundred and twenty
pieces of eight of all my cargo; and with this stock, I went
on shore in the Brazils. “
I had not been long here, before I was recommended to
the house of a good honest man, like himself, who had an
ingenio as they call it (that is, a plantation and a sugar
house). I lived with him some time, and acquainted my
self, by that means, with the manner of planting and of
making sugar; and seeing how well the planters lived, and
how they got rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could get a
license to settle there, I would turn planter among them:

my money, which I had left in London, remitted to me.
To this purpose, getting a kind of letter of naturalization,
I purchased as much land that was uncured as my money
would reach, and formed a plan for my plantation and
settlement: such a one as might be suitable to the stock
which 1 proposed to myself to receive from England. /
1 had a neighbor, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born of
English parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such
circumstances as I was. I call him my neighbor, because
his plantation lay next to mine, and we went on very soci—
ably together. My stock was but low, as well as his; and
we rather planted for food than anything else, for about two
years. However, we began to increase, and our land he-
gan to come into order; so that the third year we planted
some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground
ready for planting canes in the year to come; but we both
wanted help; and now 1 found more than before, I had
done wrong in parting with my boy Xury.
But, alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right, was
no great wopder. I had no remedy, but to go on: I had

0t into an employment quite remote to my genius, and
irectly contrary to the life I delighted in, and for which 1
iorsook my father’s house, and broke through all his good
advice: nay, I was coming into the very middle station, or
upper degree of lower life, which my father advised me to
before; and which, if I resolved to go on with, I might as
well have stayed at home, and never have fatigued myself
in the world, as 1 had done; and I used often to say to my@
self, I could have done this as well in England, among my
3t
strangers and savages, in a wilderness, and at such a dist~
ance as never to hear from any part 01 the world that had
the least knowledge of me.
In this manner, I used to look upon my condition with
the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with, but
now and then this neighbor; no work to be done, but by
the labor of my hands: and 1 used to say, I lived just like
a man cast away upon some desolate island, that had no-
body there but himself. But how just has it beenl and

present conditions with others that are worse, Heaven may
oblige them to make the exchange, and be convinced of
their former felicity by their experience: 1 say, how just
3t
island of mere desolation, should be my lot, who had so
often unjustly compared it with the life which I then led,
in which, had 1 continued, I had, in all probability, been
exceeding prosperous and rich! .
1 was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carry—
ing on the plantation, before my kind friend, the captain
of the ship that took me up at sea, went back; for the ship
remained there, in providing his lading, and preparing
for his voyage, near three months; when telling him what
little stock had left behind me in London, he gave me
this iriendly and sincere advice: Senhor lnglez, says be
(for so he always called me), it you will give me letters,
and a procuration here in form to me, with orders to the
person who has your money in London, to send your effects
to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in such
goods as are proper for this country, 1 will bring you the
produce of them, God willing, at my return: but since hu-

have you give orders for but one hundred pounds sterling,
which, you say, is half your stock, and let the hazard] be

rest the same way; and, if it miscarry, y0u may have the
other half to have recourse to for your su ply. This was
so Wholesome advice, and looked so frien ly, that I could
not but be convinced it was the best course I could take;
so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman with
whom I left my money, and a procuration to the Portu~
guese captain, as he desired me.
I wrote the English captain’s widow a full account of
all my advénthres; my slayery, escape, and how I had met
with the Portuguese captain at sea, the humanity of his be-
havior, and what condition 1 was now in, with all other
necessary directions for my supply; and when this honest
captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the
English merchants there, to send over, not the order only,
but a full aucount of my story to a merchant at London,
who re resented it effectually to her, whereupon she not
only do ivered the money, but, out of her own pocket, 'sent
the POrtuguese captain a very handsome present for his
humanity and charity to me.
The merchant in London, yesting this hundred, pounds
in English goods, such as the captain had Wrote for, sent
them directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all
safe to me at the Brazils among which, without my direc-
tion (for I Was too young in my business to think of them),
he had taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron work, and
utensils, necessary for_ my plantation, and which were of
great use to me. When this cargo arrived, I thought in
fortune made, for I was surprised with the joy of it; an

purchase and bring me over a servant, under bond for six
years’ service, and would not accept of any consideration,
except a little tobacco, which I would have him accept, be-
ing of my own pgodnce. Neither was this all: but my
goods being all uglish manufactures, such as cloths,
stuffs, baize, and things particularly valuable and desirable
in the country, 1 found means to sell them to a very great
advantage; so that I might say, I had more than four

from Lisbon: and now, increasing in business and in wealth,
my head began to be full of proyects and undertakings be~
yond my reach; such as are, indeed, often the ruin of the
est heads in business. Had I continued in the station I
was now in, I had room for all the happy things to have
yet befallen me, for which my father so earnestly recom-
mended a quiet, retired life, and which he had so sensibly
described the middle station of life to be full of: but other
things attended me, and I was still be to be the willful
agent of all my own miseries; and, particularly, to increase

my future sorrows I should have leisure to make, all these
miscarriages were rocured by my apparent obstinate ad-
hering to my foolis inclination, of wandering about, and
pursuing that inclination, in contradiction to the clearest
views of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of
those prospects, and these measures of life, which nature
and Providence concurred to present me with, and to make
my duty).
As I ad once done thus in breaking awa from my par-
ents, so I could not be content now, but must go and
leave the happy view 1 had of being a rich and thriving
man in my new plantation, only to pursue a rash and im‘
moderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the
thing admitted; and thus I cast myself down again into
the deepest gulf of human misery that ever man fell into,
or perhaps could be consistent with life, and a state of
health in the world.
To come then, by 'ust degrees, to the particulars of this
art of my story— on may suppose, that having now
ived almost four years in the Brazils, and beginuin to
thrive and prosper very well upon my plantation, I ad
not only learned the language, but had contracted an ac-
quaintance and friendship among my fellow-planters, an

well as among the merchants at St. Salvador, which was
our port: and that, in my discourses among them, 1 had
frequently given them an account of my two voyages to
the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the
Negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase on the
aosmson causes. 37
hatchets, bits of glass, and the like—not only gold dust,
Guinea grains, elephants’ teeth, etc., but Negroes, for the
service of the Brazils, in great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my discourses
on these heads, but especially to that part which related to
the buying of Negroes; which was a trade, at that time, not
only not far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been
carried on by the assimztos, or permission of the kings of
Spain and Portugal, and engrossed from the public; so
that few Negroes were bought, and those excessively dear.
It happened, being in company with some merchants
and planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those
things very earnestly, three of them came to me the next
morning, and told me they had been musing very much
upon what I had discoursed with them of the last night,
and they came to make a secret proposal to me: and, after
enjoining me to secrecy, they told me that they had a mind

tions as well as I, and were straitened for nothin so much
as servants; that as it was a trade that could not e carried
on, because they could not publicly sell the Negroes when
they came home, so they desired to make but one voyage
to bring the Negroes on shore privately, and divide them
among their own plantations; and, in a word, the question
was, whether I would go their supercargo in the ship, to
manage t e trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and
they oifere me that should have an equal share of the
Negroes, without providing any part of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must he confessed, had it
been made to any one that had not a settlement and plan-
tation of his own to look after, which was in a fair way of
coming to be very considerable, and with a good stock
upon it. But for me, that was thus entered and estab-
lished, and had nothing to do but go on as I had begun,
for three or four years more, and to have sent for the other
hundred pounds from England; and who, in that time and
with that little addition, could scarce have failed of being
worth three or four thousand pounds sterling, and that in-
creasing too; for me to think of such a voyage, was the
most preposterous thing that ever man, in such circum-
stances, could be guilty of.
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no

ling designs, when my father’s good counsel was lost upon
me. In a word, I told them I would go with all my heart,
if they would undertake to look after my plantation in my
absence, and wonldvdispose of it to such as 1 should direct,
it I miscarried. This they all engaged to do, and entered
into writings 0r covenants to do so: and I made a formal
will, disposing of my plantation and effects, in case of my
death; making the captain of the ship that had saved my
life, as before, my universal heir; but obliging him to dis-
pose of my effects as 1 had directed in my will; one-half of
the produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped
to England. In short, I took all possible caution to pre-
serve my etfects, and to keep up my plantation: had I used
half as much prudence to have looked into my own inter-
est, and have made a judgment of what I ought to have
done and not to have done, I had certainly never gone away
from so prosperous an undertaking, leaving all the prob-
able views of a thriving circumstance, and gone a voyage
to sea, attended with all its common hazards, to say noth-
ing of the reasons I had to expect particular misfortunes
to myself.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of
my fancy, rather than my reason: and accordingly, the

away to the northward upon our own coast, with design to
stretch over for the African coast. When they came about
ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, it seems,
-was the manner of their course in those days, we had very
good weather, only excessively hot all the way upon our
‘ own coast, till we came to the height of Cape St. August-
ino; from whence, keeping further oil at sea, we lost sight
of land, and steered as if we were bound for the isle Fer-i
nando de Noronha, holding our course N.E. by N. and,
leaving those isles on the east. In this course we passed
the Line in about twelve days’ time, and were, by our last
observation, in seven degrees tWenty-two minutes northern
latitude, when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us
quite out of our'knowledge: it began from the south-east,
came about to the north-west, and. then settled in the
north-east; from whence it blew in such a terrible manner,
that for twelve days together we could do nothing but
drive, and, scudding away before it, let it carry us whither-
soever fate and the fury of the winds directed; and, during
these twelve days, 1 need not say that 1 expected every day
to be swallowed up; ‘nor, indeed, did any in the ship expect
to save their lives. ‘
In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the storm,
one of our men dead of the calenture, and one man and a
boy washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the
weather abating a little, the master made an observation
as well as he could, and found that he was in about eleven
de rees north latitude, but that he was twenty-two degrees
of ongitude difference, west from Cape St. Augustino; so
that he found he was got upon the coast of Guiana, or the
north part of Brazil, beyond the river Amazon, toward
that of the river Oronoco, commonly called the Great
River; and began to consult with me what course he
should take, for the ship was leaky and very much dis-
abled, and he was for gomg directly back to the coast of
Brazil.
1 was positively against that; and looking over the charts
of the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there

voyage to the coast of Africa without some assistance, both
to our ship and ourselves.
With this design we changed our course and steered away
N. W. by W., in order to reach some 0! our English islands,
where I hoped for relief; but our voyage was otherwise de~
termined; or being in the latitude of twelve degrees eigh-
teen minutes, a second storm came upon us which carried
us away with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us
so out of the way of all human commerce, that had
all our lives been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in
danger of being devoured by savages than ever returning
to our own country.
In this distress, the wind still blowing ver hard, one of
our men early in the morning, cried out, nd! and we
had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of
seeing whereabouts in the world we were, than the ship
struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her motion being
so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner that
we expected we should all have perished immediately; and
we were immediately driven into our close quarters, to
shelter us from the foam and spray of the sea.
It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like
condition to describe or conceive the consternation of men
in such circumstances; we knew nothing where we were,
or upon what land it was we were driven, whether an island
or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; and as
the rage of the wind was still great, though rather less than

many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the wind,
by a kind of miracle, should immediately turn about. In
a word we sat looking upon one another, and expecting
death every moment, and every man acting accordingly, as
preparing for another world; for there was little or noth-
ing more for us to do in this. That which was our present
comfort, and all the comfort we had, was that, contrary to
our expectation, the ship did not break yet, and that the
master said the wind began to abate.
Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate,
yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and stick-
ing too fast for us to expect her getting off, we were in a
!dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing to do, but to
think of saving our lives as well as we could. We had a
aosmson cnuson. 41
I staved by dashing against the ship’s rudder, and, in the
next place, she broke away, and either sunk, or was driven
off to sea; so there was no hope from her; we had another
boat on board, but how to get her off into the sea was a
doubtful thing; however, there was no room to debate, for
we fancied the ship would break in pieces every minute,
and some told us she was actually broken already.
i In this distress the mate of our vessel laid hold of the
boat, and with the help of the rest of the men they got her
aosmson cnuson. 41
her go and committed ourselves, being eleven in number,
to God’s mercy, and the wild sea; for though the storm
was abated considerably, yet the sea went dreadfully high
u on the shore, and might be well called den wild zee, as
the utch call the sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw
plainly, that the sea went so high, that the boat could not
live, and that we should be inevitably drowned. As to
making sail, we had none; nor, if we had, could we have
done anything with it; so we worked at the car toward the
land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to execu-
tion; for we all knew that when the boat came nearer to
the shore, she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the
breach of the sea. However, we committed our souls to
God in the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us
toward the shore, we hastened our destruction with our
own hand, pulling as well as we could toward land.
What the shore was—whether rock or sand, whether
steep or shoal—we knew not; the only hope that could
rationally give us the least shadow of expectation, was, if
we might happen into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of
some river, where by great chance we might have run our
boat in, or got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made
smooth water.- But nothing of this appeared; and as we
made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more
frightful than the sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league
and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-
like, came rolling astern of us, and plainly bade us expect
the coup de grace. In a word, it took us with such fury,
that it overset the boat at once; and separating us, as wall
from. theboat as from one another, gave us no time hardly
to say, “ Oh, God!” for we were all swallowed up in a mo-
ment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I
felt, when I sunk into the water; for though I swam very
well, yet I could not deliver myself from the waves so as
to draw my breath, till that wave having driVen me, or
rather carried me, a vast way on toward the shore, and
having spent itself, Went back, and left me upon the land
almost dry, but half dead with the water I took in. I had
so much presence of mind, as well as breath left, that see-
ing myself nearer the main land than I expected, 1 got
upon my feet and endeavored to make on toward the land
as fast as I could, before another wave should return and
take me up a ain; but I soon found it was impossible to
avoid it; for saw the sea come after me as high as a great
.hill, and as furious as an enemy which I had no means or
strength to contend with ; my business was to hold my
breath and raise myself upon the water, if 1 could; and so,
by swimming, to preserve my breathing and pilot myself
toward the shore, if possible; my greatest Concern now be-
ing that the wave, as it would carry me a great way toWard
the shore when it came on, might not carry me back again
with it when it gave back toward the sea.
The wave that came upon me again buried me at once
twent or thirty feet deep in its own body, and I could feel
myelf carried with a mighty force and swiftness toward
the shore, a very great way; but I held my breath, and
assisted myself to swim still forward with all my might.
I was ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as 1
b felt myself rising up, so, to my immediate relief, 1 found
my head and hands shoot out above the surface of the
water; and thou h it was not two seconds of time that 1
could keep mysel so, yet it relieved me greatly, gaVe me
breath and new courage. 1 was covered again with Water

ing the Water had spent itsel , and began to return, I struck

The last time 01 these two had well-nigh been fatal to

that with such force that it left me senseless, and indeed
helpless, s to my own deliverance; for the blow, taking
my side a 6 breast, heat the breath, as it Were, quite out

have been strangled in the water; but I recovered a little

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel—when the breach
and froth of the sea being so big I could hardly see it, it lay
so far off—and considered, Lord! how was it possible I
could get on shore? ‘
After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part
of my condition I began to look around me, to see what
kind of a place 1 was in, and what was next to be done;
and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in a word,
I had a dreadful deliverance; for I was wet, had no clothes
to shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink, to com-
fort me; neither did I see any prospect before me, but that
of perishing with hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts;

I had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature for
my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other creat-
ure that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I
had nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a
little tobacco in a box. This was all my provision; and
this threw me into such terrible agonies of mind, that for
awhile I ran about like a madman. Night coming upon
me, I began, with a heavy heart, to consider what would

we had been all safe; that is to say, we had all got safe on
shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left entire-

This forced tears from my eyes again; but as there was lit-

good, the third had taken water. Those two I got to my
raft, with the arms. And now I thought myself pretty

thus, having found two or three broken oars belonging to

found two saws, an ax, and a hammer; and with this cargo

As I imagined, so it was; there appeared before me a lit-
tle opening of the land, and I found a strong current of
the tide set into it; so I guided my raft as well as I could,
to get into the middle of the stream. But here I had like
to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I
think it verily would have broken my heart; for, knowing
nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it
upona shoal, and not being aground at the other end, it
wanted but a little that all my car 0 had slipped off toward
that end that was afloat, and so allen into the water. I
did my utmost, by setting my back a ainst the chests, to
keep them in their places, but coul not thrust off the
raft with all my strength; neither durst I stir from the
posture I was in, but holding up the cheats with all my
might, I stood in that manner near half an hour, in which
time the rising of the water brought me a little more upon

myself in the mouth of a little river, with land on both sides,
and a strong current or tide running up. I looked on both
sides for a proper place to get to shere, for I was not will-
ing to be driven too high up the river, hoping in time to
see some shi at sea, and therefore resolved to place my-
self as near t e coast as I could.
At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the

seemed to overtop some other hills, which lay as in a ridge
from it, northward. I took out one of the fowling- ieces,

and beak resembling it, but it had no talons or claws more

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft,
and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took
me up the rest of that day; what to do with myself at
night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest, for I was
afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but some
wild beast might devour me; then h, asl afterward found,
there was really no need for those cars. However, as well
as I could, I barricaded myself round with the chests and
boards that I had brou ht on shore, and made a kind of

which way to supply myself, except that I had seen two or
three creatures, like hares, run out of the wood where 1

I soon emptied the hogshead of that read, and wrapped

into pieces such as 1 could move, I got two cables and a
hawser on shore, with all the iron work -1 could get; and
having cut down the spritsail-yard, and the mizzen-yard,
and everything I could, to make a large raft, I loaded it
with all those heavy goods, and came away; but my good
luck began now to leave me, for this raft was so unwieldy
and so overladen that after I was entered the little cove,
where I had landed the rest of my goods, not being able to,
guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset, and threw
me and all my cargo into the water; as for myself, it was
no great harm, for 1 was near the shore, but as‘to my
cargo, it was a great part of it lost, especially the iron,
which I expected would have been of great use to me; how-
ever, when the tide was out I got most of the pieces of cable
“ aoameos cause!
for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work which
fatigued me very much. After this I went every day on
board, and brought away what 1 could get.
I had now been thirteen days ashore, and had been
eleven. times on board the shi , in which time I had
brought away all that one pair 0 hands could well be sup-
posed capable to bring; though I believe verily, had the
calm weather held, 1 should have brought away the whole
ship piece by piece, but preparing, the twelfth time, to go
on board, I found the wind began to rise; however, at low
water, I went on board, and though I thought I had rum~
maged the cabin so effectually as that nothing could be
found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one
of which I found two or three razors. and one pair of large
scissors, with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks;
in another I found about thirty-six pounds in money, some
European coin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some
old, and some silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. Oh, drug!
I exclaimed, what art thou good for? Thou art not worth
to me, no, not the taking 011 the ground; one of those
knives is worth all this heap. I have no manner of use for
thee; e’en remain where thou art, and go to the bottom, as
a creature whose life is not worth saving; However, upon
second thoughts, I took it away, and wrapping all this in a
piece of canvas, I began to think of making another raft;
ut while I was preparing this I found the sky overcast,
and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it
blew a fresh gale from the shore. 1t presently occurred to
me that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the
wind off sliore; and that it was my business to be gone be-

able to reach the shore at all. Accordingly I let myself
down into the water, and swam across the channel which
lay between the ship and the sands, and even that with
ROBINSON causes. 53
I had about me, and partly the roughness of the water; for
the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high
water it blew a storm. ~
But I was got home to my little tent, where I lay, with
\ all my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all
that night, and in the morning when I looked out, behold,
no more ship was to be seen! i was a little surprised, but
ROBINSON causes. 53
I had lost no time nor abated no diligence to get everythin
out of her that could be useful to me, and that ind
there was little left in her that 1 was able to bring away, if
1 had had more time. _
1 now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or at
\
anything out of her, except what might drive on shore,
from her wreck; as, indee , divers pieces of her afterward
did ; but those things were of small use to me.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing
myself against either savages, if any should appear, or
wild beasts, if any were in the island; and I had many
thou hts of the method how to do this, and what kind of
dwel ing to make, whether 1 should make me a cave in the
earth or a tent upon the earth; and, in short, I resolved
upon both; the manner and description of which it may
not be improper to give an account of.
I soon found the place I was in was not for my settle-
ment, particularly because it was upon a low, moorish
ground, near the sea, and I believed it would not be whole- ‘
some; and more particularly because there was no fresh

1 consulted several things in my situation, which I found
Would be proper for me: First, air and fresh water, 1 just
now mentioned; secondly, shelter from the heat of the sun;
thirdly, security from ravenous creatures, whether men or
beasts; fourthl , a view to the sea, that if God sent any
ship in sight, might not lose any advantage for my de-
liverance, of which I was not willing to banish all my ex-
pectation yet.
In search for a place proper for this, 1 found alittle
lain on the side of a rising hill, whose front toward this
'ttle plain was steep as a house-side, so that nothing could
come down upon me from the top. On the side of this
rock, there was a hollow place, worn a little way in, like
the entrance or door of a cave; but there was not really
any cave or way into the rock at all.

resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above a
hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay like
a green before my door; and, at the end of it, descended
irregularly every way down into the low ground by the sea-
side. It was on the N. N. W. side of the bill; so that it was
sheltered from the heat every day, till it came to a Wt and
by S. sun, or thereabouts, which, in those countries, is
near the setting. -
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the
hollow place, which tookgin abgutten yards in its semi- >
diameter from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter,
from its beginning and ending.
In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes,

did not stand above six inches from each other.
Then 1 took the pieces of cable which I cut in the shi
and laid them in rows, one upon another, within the eirc e,
between these two rows~of stakes, up to the top, placing
other stakes in the inside, leaning against them, about two
feet and a half high, like a spur to a post; and this fence
was so strong that neither man nor beast could get into it
or over it. This cost me a great deal of time and labor,
especially to cut the piles in the woods, bring them to the
place, and drive them into the earth. '
The entrance into this place I made to be not b a door,

tent, which, to preserve me from the rains that in one part
of the year are very violent there, I made double, viz., one
smaller tent within and one larger tent above it, and cov-
ered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had
saved among the sails. .
And now I lay no more for awhile in the bed which I
had brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed
a very good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship.
Into this tent I brought all. my rovisions, and every-

all my goods, I made up the entrance, which till now I had
legtdopen, and so passed and repassed, as 1 said, by a short
la er.
When 1 had done this I began to work my way into the
rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug
down out through my tent, I laid them up within my fence
in the nature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground
within about a foot and a half; and thus 1 made me a cave,
just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my
house. It cost me much labor and many days, before all
these things were brought to perfection; and therefore I
must go back to some other things which took up some Of
my thoughts. At the same time it happened, after I had
laid my scheme for the setting up my tent, and making
the cave, that a storm of rain falling from a thick, dark

thought which darted into my mind as swift as the light-

be destroyed; on which, not my defense only, but the pro-
viding me food, as I thought, entirely depended. l was

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the
storm was over I laid aside all my works, my building and
fortifying, and applied myself to make bags and hexes to
separate the powder, and to keep it a little and a little in a
arcel, in hope that whatever might come, it might not all

in all was about two hundred and forty pounds weight,
was divided into not less than a hundred parcels. As to
the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any dan-
er from that; so I placed it in my new cave which, in my
ancy, I called my kitchen, and the rest I hid up and down
in holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come to it,
marking very carefully where I laid it. ' 2

this, not doubting but 1 might now and then shoot one,
as it soon happened; for after I had found their haunts a
little, I laid wait in this manner for them; I observed, if
‘hey saw me in the valleys, though they were upon the
rocks, they would run away as in a terrible fright; but if
they were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the rocks,
they took no notice of me, from whence I concluded that

downward that they did not readily see objects that were

but when the old one fell the kid stood stock-still by her
till I came and took her up; and not only so, but when I
carried the old one with me, upon my shoulders, the kid
followed me uite to my inclosure; upon which I laid down
the dam, an took the kid in my arms, and carried it
over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame; but it

cave, and what conveniences i made, I shall ive a full ac-
count of it in its pro r place; but I must rst give some »
little account of myse f, and of my thoughts about living,
which, it may well be supposed, were not a few.
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was
not cast away upon that island without being driven, as 1:
said, by a violent storm quite out of the course of our in-
tended voyage, and a great way, viz., some hundredi 0‘
leagues, out of the ordinary course of the trade of meal
kind, 1 had great reason to consider it as a determination
of Heaven, that in this desolate place, and in this desolate
manner, I should end my life. The tears would run
59 nonmson cnuson. '
and sometimes I would expostulate with myself why Provi-
dence should thus completely ruin its creatures, and render
them so absolutely miserable; so abandoned without hel ,
so entirely depressed, that it could hardly be rational to Be
thankful for such a life.
But something always returned swift upon me to check
these thoughts, and to reprove me; and particularly, one
day walking with my gun in my hand, by the sea-side, l
was very pensive upon the subjct of my resent condition,
when reason, as it were, expostulated With me the other
way, thus: Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true;
but, pray remember, where are the rest of on? Did not
on come eleven of you into the boat? here are the

on singled out? Is it better to be here or there? And
hen I pointed to the sea. All evils are to be considered
with the good that is in them, and with what worse attends
them.
Then it occurred to me again, how well 1 was furnished
for m subsistence, and what would have been my case it

to provide myself in such a manner as to live without my
gun, when my ammunition was spent; so that 1 had a
tolerable view of subsisting, without any want, as long as I
lived; for 1 considered, from the beginning, how I would
provide for the accidents that might happen, and for the
time that was to come, notrgnly after my ammunition
{ould be spent, but even after my health or strength

I confess, I had not entertained any notion of my am-
munition being destroyed at one blast, I mean my powder
being blown up by lightning; and this made the thoughts
of it so surprising to me when it lightened and thundered,
as I observed just now.
And now being about to enter into a melancholy relation
of a scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of
in the world before, 1 shall take it from its beginning and
continue it in its order. It was, by my account, the 30th

Want of Tools—He arranges his Habitation.
AFTER 1 had been there about ten or twelve days, it
came into my thoughts that 1 should lose my reckoning of
time for want of books and pen and ink, and should even
forget the Sabbath days from the Working days; but, to
prevent this, I cut it with my knife upon a large post, in
capital letters; and making it into a great cross, set-it up

and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and
yearly reckoning of time.
But it happened that among the many things which I
brought out of the ship, in the several vo ages which, as
above mentioned, 1 made to it, I got several things or less
value, but not at all less useful to me, which I found s'ome~
time after in rummaging the chests; as, in particular,
pens, ink, and paper; seyeral pgrcels in the captain’s,
mate’s, gunner’s, and carpenter’s keeping; three or four
compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials, per-
spectives, charts and books of navigation; all of which I
huddled together, whether 1 might want them or no; also
1 found three very good Bibles, which came to me in my
cargo from England, and which I had packed up among
my thin 8; Some Portuguese books also, and among them
two or t ree popish prayer-books, and several other books,

we had in the ship a dog and two cats, of whose eminent

for 1 carried both the cats with me, and as for the dog, he

a trusty servant to me for many years. I wanted nothing
that he could fetch me, nor any company that he could
make up to me, 1 only wanted to have him talk to me, but
that would not do. As I observed before, I found pens,
ink, and paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost; and
I shall show that while my ink lasted, I kept 'Jhings very
exact, but after that was gone, I could not; for I could not
make any ink, by any means that I could devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many things,
notwithstanding all that I had amassed together; and of
these this of ink was one, as also a spade, pick-ax, and
shovel, to dig or remove the earth, needles, pins, and
thread; as for linen, I soon learned to want that without

1 now began to consider seriously my condition, and the
circumstance I was reduced to; and I drew up the state of
my affairs in writing, not so much to leave them to any
that were to come after me (for 1 was like to have but few
heirs), as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condi—
tion, and given 'over looking out to sea, to see it I could
spy a ship; I say, given over these things, I began to apply
myself to accommodate my way ol.‘ living, and to make
things as easy to me as 1 could.
I have already described my habitation, which Was a

pale of posts and cables; but 1 might now rather call it a
wall, for I raised a kind of Wall against it of turfs, about
two feet thick on the outside: and after some time (1 think
it was a year and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to
the rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees,
and such things as 1 could get, to keep out the rain; which
1 found, at some times of the year, very violent.

up all my place; I had no room to turn m self: so 1 set
myself to enlarge my cave, and work fur her into the

the labor I bestowed on it: and when I found 1 was retty
safe as to the beasts of prey, I worked sideways, 50 the
right hand, into the rock, and then turning to the right
again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out

, This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were, a
back way to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me
room to stow my goods. '
And now I began to apply myself to make such hec'ss-
sary things as I found I most wanted, particularly a chaii
and a table; for without these I was not able to enjoy. the
few comforts I had in the World; I could not write, or eat,
or do several things with so much pleasure, without a
table: so I went to work. And here I must needs observe,
that as reason is the substance and original of the mathe-
matics, so by stating and squaring everything by reason,
and by making the most rational judgment of things, every
man may be, in time, master of every mechanic art. I
had never handled a tool in my life; and yet, in time, by
labor, application, and eontrivance I found at last, that I
wanted nothing but I could have made, especially if I had

by this method, I could make but one board of a whole
tree; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more
than I had for a prodigious deal of time and labor which
it took me up to make a plank or board: but my time or
labor was little worth, an so it was as well employed one
way as another.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed

at when I wrought out some boards, as above, I made
Iarge shelves, of the breadth of afoot and a half, one over
another, all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools,
nails, and iron work on; and, in a word, to separate every-
thing at large in their places, that I might easily come at
them. I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock, to hang
my guns, and. all things that would hang up: so that. had

of mind; and my journal would, too, have been full of
many dull things: for example, I must have said thus—

beating my head and face, exclaimin at my misery, and
crying out I was undone, undone! til, tired and faint, l
was forced to lie down on the ground to repose; but durst
not sleep, for fear of being devoured.”
Some days after this, and after I had been on board the
ship and got all that I could out of her, I could not forbear
getting up to the top of a little mountain, and looking out
to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship: then fancy that, at a vast
distance, I spied a sail, please myself with the hopes of it,
and, after looking steadily, till I was almost blind, lose it
quite, and sit down and weep like a child, and thus in-
crease my misery by my folly.
But, havin got over these things in some measure, and
having settlergl my household stuff and habitation, made
me a table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I
could, I began to keep my journal: of which I shall here
give you the copy (though in it will be told all these partic-
ulars over again) as long as it lasted; for, having no more
ink, 1 was forced to leave it off.

SEPTEMBER 30th, 1659. I, poor miserable Robinson

broken in pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get
on board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for
my relief,) so, on the other hand, it renewed my rief at
the loss of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we ad all
stayed on board, might have saved the ship, or, at least,
that they Muld not have been all drowned, as they were:
and that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps have
built us a boat, out of the ruins of the ship, to have carried
as to some other part of the world. I spent 'great part of
this day in perplexing myself on these things; but, at

viz., a pickax, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket; so
1 desisted from my work, and began to consider how to
supply these wants, and make me some tools. As for a '
pickax, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper
enough, though heavy: but the next thing was a shovel or
spade; this was so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I

and my having no other way, made me a long while upon
this machine: for I worked it effectually, by little and
little, into the form of a shovel or spade; the handle exact-
1y shaped like ours in .England, only that the broad part
having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last
me so long: however, it served well enough for the uses
which 1 had occasion to put it to; but never was a shovel,

not without reason too; for if I had been under it, I should
never have wanted a grave-digger. Upon this disaster, I
had a great deal of work to do over again, for 1 had the
loose earth to carry out; and, which was of more import-
ance, 1 had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure
no more would come down.

the posts, standing in rows, served me for partitions to
part 05 my house.

knocked up nails on the posts, to hang everything up that
could be hung up: and now I began to be in some order
within doors. ,
Dec. 20. I carried everything into the cave, and began to
furnish my house, and set up some ieces of boards, like a

very scarce with me: also I made me another table.

This evening, going further into the valleys which lay
toward the center of the island, I found there was plenty
cf goats, though exceeding shy, and hard to come at; how-
ever, I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt
them down. Accordingly, the next day, I went out with
my dog, and set him upon the goats: but I was mistaken,
for they all faced about open the dog: and he knew his
danger too well, for he would not come near them.

myself that if any people were to come on shore there they
would not perceive anything like a. habitation: and it was
very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a'
very remarkable occasion.
During this time, I made my rounds in the woods for
game every day, when the rain permitted me, and made
frequent discoveries, in these walks, of something or other
to my advantage; particularly, I found a kind of wild
pigeons, who build, not as wood-pigeons, in a tree, but
rather as house-pigeons, in the hOles of the rocks: and,
taking some young ones, I endeavored to breed them up

as indeed, as to some of them, it was: for instance, I could!
never make a cask to be hooped. I had a small runlet or
two, as I observed before; ,but I could never arrive at the
capacity of making one by them, though I spent many
weeks about it: I could neither put in the heads, nor join
the staves so true‘ to one another as to make them hold|

water; so I gaVe that also over. In the next place, I was
at a great loss for candle; so that as soon as it was dark,
which was generally by seven o’clock, I was obliged to go
to bed. I remember the lump of bees-wax with which I
made candles in my ‘African adventure; but I had none of
that now: the only remedy I had was, that when I had
killed a goat, I i“ saved the tallow; and with a little dish
made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added
a Wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave
me light, though not a clear steady light like a candle. In
the middle of all my labors it happened, that in rummag-
ing my things, I found a little bag; which, as I hinted be-

not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship
came from Lisbon. What little remainder of corn had
been in the bag Was all devoured by the rats, and I saw
nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being willing
to haVe the bag for some other use (I think it was to put.~
powder in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or
some such use), I shook the husks of corn out of it, on one
sonmson cnusos. .71‘
It Was a little before the great rain just now mentioned,
that I threw this stuff away; taking no notice of anything,
and not so much as remembering that I had thrown any-
‘thing there, when, about a month after, I saw Some few
blades of something green, shooting out of the ground,
which fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I
was surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little
longer time, I saw about ten -or twelve ears come out,
which were perfect green barley, of the same kind as our
European, nay, as our, English barley. I
It is impossible to express the astonishment and confu-
sion of my thoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted
upon no religious foundation at all: indeed, I had ver few
notions of religion,in my head, nor had entertains any
sense of any things that had befallen me, otherwise than as
chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases God; without so
much as inquiring into the end of Providence in these
things, or his order in governing events in the world. But
after I saw barley grow there, in a climate which I knew
' was not proper for corn, and especially as I knew not how
it came there, it startled Inc strangely; and I began to sug-
gest, that God had miraculously caused this grain to grow

without any help of seed sown, and that it was so directed
purely for my sustenance, on that wild miserable place.
This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of
my eyes; and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy
of nature should happen upon my account: and this was
the more strange to me, because 1 saw near it still, all
alon by the side of the rock, some other straggling stalks,
whicIr 1proved to he stalks of rice, and which I knew, be-
cause had‘ seen it grow in Africa, when I was ashore
there.
1 not only thought these the pure productions of Provi-
dence for mysupport, but, not doubting that there was
more in the place, 1 went over all’ that part of the island
where I had been before, searching in every corner, and

At last it occurred to my thoughts, that I had shook out a
bag of chicken’s-meat in that place, and then the wonder
began to cease; and 1 must confess, my religious thankful-
ness to God’s providence began to abate too, upon the dis-
covering that all this was nothing but what was common;
though ought to have been as thankful for so strange and
unforeseen a providence, as if it had been miraculous: for
it was really the work of Providence, as to me, that should
order or appoint that ten or twelve grains of corn should
remain unspoiled, when the rats had destroyed all the rest,
as if it had been dropped from heaven; as also, that I
should throw it out in that particular place, where, it be-
ing in the shade of a high rock, it sprung up immediately;
whereas, if 1 had thrown it anywhere else, at that time, it
would have been burned up and destroyed.
1 carefully saved the ears ofthis corn, y0u may be sure,
in their season, which was about the end of June; and,
laying up every corn, I resolved to sow them all again;

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or
thirty stalks of rice. which I preserved withtho same care;
and whose use was of the same kind, or to the same pur-
pose, viz., to make me bread, or rather food; for I found
ways to 000k it up without baking, though I did that also
after some time. But to return to my journal.
I worked excessively hard these three or four months, to
get my wall done; and the 14th of April 1 closed it up;

ribly frightened with a most dreadful surprising thing in-
deed; for, all on a sudden, I found the earth come crumb-
ling down from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of
the hill over my head, and two of the posts 1 had set up in
the cave cracked in a frightful manner. I was heartily
scared; but thought nothing of what really was the cause,
only thinking that the top of my cave was falling in, as
some of it had done before: and for fear I should be buried
in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not thinking myself
safe there neither, I got over my wall fbr fear of the pieces
of the hill which I expected might roll down upon me. I

plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake: for the ground I
stood dn shook three times at about eight minntes’ dis-
tan ee, with three such shocks as would have overturned the
strongest building that could be supposed to have stood on
the earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock, which
stood about half a mile from me, next the sea, fell down
with such a terrible n0ise as I never heard in all my life.
1 perceived also that the very sea. was put into a violent
motion by it; and I believe the shocks were stronger under
the water than on the island.
I was so much amazed with the thing itself (havin

second time.
After the third shock was own, and I felt no more for
some time, I began to take courage; yet I had not heart
enough to go over my wall again, for fear of being buried
alive; but sat still upon the ground greatly castdown, and
disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All this while I
had not the least serious religious thought; nothing but
the common “ Lord, have mercy upon me! ” and when it

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow
cloudy, as if it would rain; and soon after the wind‘rose by

and a terrible storm it was. This held about three hours,

when, one sudden, it came into my thoughts that these
winds and rain being the consequence of the earthquake,
the earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might ven-
ture into my cave again. With this thought my spirits be-
gan to revive; and the rain also helping to persuade me, I
went in, and sat down in my tent; but the rain was so vio-
lent, that my tent was ready todhe beaten down with it;

After I had been in my cave for some time, and found no

part of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad: but
my mind being more cemposed, I began to think of whatI
had best do; concluding, that if the island was subject to
these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a
cave, but I must consider of building me some little but in
an o 11 place, which I might surround with a wall, as I
had One here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts
or men: for if I stayed where I was, I should certainly,
one time or other, be buried alive.
With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from '
the place where it now stood, being just under the hanging
precipice of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken
again, would certainly fall upon my tent. I spent the next
two days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving
where and how to remove my habitation. The fear of be-
ing swallowed alive affected me so that I never slept in
quiet; and yet the apprehension of lying abroad, without
any fence, was almost equal to it: but‘still, when I looked
about, and saw how everything was put in order, how
pleasantly I Was concealed, and how safe from danger, it
made me very loath to remove. ‘ In the meantime, it
occurred to me that it would require a vast deal of tinm
for 'me to do this; and that I must be contented to run the
risk where I was, till I had formed a convenient camp,
and secured it so as to remove to it. With this conclusion
I composed myself for a time; and resolved that I would
go, to work with all speed to build me a wall with ‘piles and
cables, etc., in a circle as before, and set up my tent in it

it and grind my tools too. This caused me as much
thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand
point of politics, or a judge upon the life and death of a

it with my foot, that I might have both my hands at lib-

at least not to take notice how it was done, though since 1

me a. full week’s work to bring it to perfection.

MAY 1. In the, morning, looking toward the sea-side,
the tide being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger
than ordinary, and it looked like a cask; when I came to
it I found a small barrel, and two or three pieces of the
wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by the late
hurricane; and looking toward the wreck itself, I thought
it seemed to lie higher out of the water than it used to do.
I examined the barrel that was driven on shore, and soon
Iound it was a barrel of gunpowder; but it had taken
water, and the powder was caked as hard as a stone; how-
ever, I rolled it further on the shore for the present, and
went on upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of
the ship, to look for more.
When 1 came down to the ship I found 1t strangely re-
moved. The forecastle, which lay before buried in the
sand, was heaved up at least six feet; and the stern (which
was broke to pieces, and parted from the rest, by the force
of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging of her) was
tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one side; and the sand
was thrown so high on that side next her stern, that I could
now walk quite up to her when the tide was out; whereas
there was a great piece of water before, so that I could not
come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swim-

eluded it must be done by the earthquake; and as by this
violence the ship was more broken open than formerly, so
many things came daily on shore, which the sea had
loosenrd, and which the winds and water rolled by degrees
to the land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of re-
moving my habitation; and I busied myself mi htily, that
day especially, in searching whether 1 could ma e any way
into the ship; but I found nothing was to be expected of
that kind. for all the inside of the ship was choked u with
sand. However, as I had learned not to despair 0 an -

but he moved forward toward me with a long speau or
weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he came to a
rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me, or I heard
a voice so terrible that it is impossible to express the ter-
ror of it; all that I can say I understood was this: Seeing
all these things have not brought thee to repentance, now
thou shalt die; at which words I thought he lifted up the
spear that was in his hand to kill, me. , ,,
No one that shall ever read this account will expect that
I should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this
terrible vision; 1 mean, that even while it was a dream, I
even dreamed of those horrors; nor is it any more possible
to describe the impression that remained upon my mind
when l awaked, and found it was but a dream.
I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had received
by the good instruction of my father was then worn out,
by an uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafarin
wickedness, and a constant conversation with none but us
as were, like mymlf, wicked and profane to iho last de-
gree. I do not remember that 1 had, in all that time, one .

good, or consciousness of evil, had entirely overwhelmed
me, and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking,

of God, in danger, or of thankfulness to Him, in deliver-

all the variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me,
I never had so much as one thought of its being the hand
of God, or that it was a just punishment for my sin;
either my rebellious behavior against my father, or my
present sins, which were great; or even as a punishment
for the general course of my wicked life. W hen l was on

‘ rounded me, as well from voracious creatures as cruel sav-

by the dictates of common sense only, and indeed hardly
that. When 1 was delivered and taken up at sea by the
Portuguese captain, well used, and dealt with justly and

the violence of the fever; conscience, that had slept so
long, began to awake, and 1 reproached myself with my

wickedness, provoked the justice of God to lay me under

of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my conscience“,
extorted from me some words like praying to. God; though
loan not say it was a prayer attended either with desires
or with hopes; it was rather the voice of mere fright and

After I had eaten I tried to walk; but found myself so
Weak that I could hardly carry the gun (for 1 never went
out without that); so I went but a little way, and sat down
, upon the ground, lookin out upon the sea, which was just
before me, and very ea In and smooth. As I sat here,
some such thoughts as these occurred to me: What is this
earth and sea, of which I have seen so much? Whence is
it reduced? And what am I, and all the other creatures,
w' d and tame, human and brutal? Whence are we?
Surely, we are all made by some secret power, who
formed the earth and sea, the air and sky. And who is
that? Then it followed most naturally, It is God that has
made all. Well, but then, it came on, if God has made all
these things, He guides and governs them all, and all
things that concern them, for the power that could make
all things must certainly have power to guide and direct
them; i so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of H is
Works, either without His knowledge or appointment.
. And if nothing happens without His knowledge He
knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful condition;
and if nothing happens without His appointment, He has
a pointed all this to befall me. Nothing occurred to my
t ought to contradict any of these conclusions; and there-
fore it rested upon me with the greatest force that it must
needs be that God had appointed all this to befall me; that
I was brought to this miserable circumstance by His direc-
tion, He having the sole power, not of me only, but of
everything that happens in the world. Immediately it
followed, Why has God done this to me? What have I
done to be thus used? My conscience presently checked
me in that inquiry, as if 1 had blasphemed; and methou ht
it spoke to me like a voice! Wretch, dost thou ask w at

I went, directed b Heaven, no doubt; for in this chest

and found what I looked for, viz., the tobacco; and as the
few books I had saved lay there too, I took out one of the
Bibles which I mentioned before, and which, to this time,
I had not found leisure, or so much as inclination, to look
into. I say I took it out", and brought both that and the
tobacco with me to the table. What use to make of the
tobacco I knew not, as to my d:stemper, nor whether it

tion, that I disregarded the deliverance I had received; and
I was, as it were, made to ask myself such questions as
these, viz.: Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully,

have I taken of it? Have I done my part? God has de-

ance; and how can I expect a greater deliverance? This
touched my heart very much, and immediately I knelt
down and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery from my
sickness.
July 4. In the morning I took the Bible; and beginnin
at the New Testament, I began seriously to read it; an
imposed upon myself to read awhile every morning and
every night; not binding myself to the number of chapters,
but as long as my thoughts should engage me. It was not
long after I set seriously to this work, that I found my
heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the wicked-
ness of my past life. The impression of my dream. re-
vived; and the .words, All these things have not brought
thee to repentance, ran seriously in my thoughts. I was
earnestly begging of God to give me repentance, when it
happened providentially, the very same day, that, reading
the “Scripture, I came to these words, “He is exalted a.
Prince and a Saviour; to give repentance and to give remis-
sion.” I threw dovm the book ; and with my heart as well
as :11 hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of

sense of the words, that I prayed; for now I prayed with a
sense of my condition, and with a true scripture view of
ho e, founded on the encouragement of the word of God:
an from this time, I may say, I began to have hope that
God would hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned above,
“ Call on Me, and 1 will deliver thee,” in a different sense
from what I had ever done before; for then I had no notice
of anything being called deliverance, but my being deliv-
ered from the captivity I was in: for though I was indeed
at large in the place, yet the island was certainly a prison
to me, and that in the worst sense of the word. But now
I learned to take it in another sense: now I looked back
upon my past life with such horror, and my sins appeared
l0 dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God but deliv-
erance from the load of guilt that bore down all my com-
fort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so
much as pray to be delivered from it, or think of it; it was
all of no consideration, in comparison with this. And I
add this part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that
whenever they come to a true sense of things, they will

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable
as to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind: and ,
my thoughts being directed, by constantly reading the
Scripture and praying to God, to things of a higher nature,
I had a great deal of comfort within, which, till now, I

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again;
and after going something further than I had gone the
day before, I found the brook and the savannas begin to
cease, and the country become more woody than before. '
In this part I found different fruits; and particularly I
found melons upon the ground in great abundance, and
grapes upon the trees: the vines, indeed, had spread over
the trees, and the clusters of grapes were now just in their
prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surprising discov-
ery, and I was exceedingly glad of them, but I was warned
by my experience to eat sparingly of them; remembering
that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes

came to an opening, where the country seemed to descend
to the west; and a little spring of fresh water, which issued
out at the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that

and very few bearing any fruit; at least not then. How-
ever, the green limes that I gathered were not only pleas-
ant to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice
afterward with Water, which made it very wholesome, and
very cool and refreshing. I found now 1 bad business
enough, to gather and carry home; and I resolved to lay
up a store, as well- of grapes as limes and lemons, to fur-
nish m self for the wet season, which I knew was approach,
ing. n order to do this, I gathered a great heap of grapes
in cne place, a lesser heap in another place; and a great
parcel of limes and lemons in another place; and taking a
few of each with me, I traveled homeward; and resolved
to come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could
make, to carry the rest home. Accordingly, having spent
three days in this journey, I came home (so I must now
call my tent and my cave): but before I got thither, the
grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruits, and the
weight of the juice, having broken and bruised them, they
were good for little or nothing: as to the limes, they were
good, but I could bring only a few.
The next day being the 19th, I went back, having made
me two small bags to bring home my harvest; but I was
surprised when coming to my heap of grapes, which were

However, as I found there was no laying them up in heaps
and no carrying them away in a sack; but‘that one way
they would be destroyed, and the other way they would be
crushed with their own weight; 1 took another course: 1
then gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and hung
them upon the out-branches of the trees, that they might
cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and lemon“,
I carried as many back as I could well stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I contemplated
with great pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the
pleasantness of the situation; the security from storms on
that side; the water and the wood; and concluded that 1

This thought ran long in my head; and l was exceeding
fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of the place tempt-

cred that I was now by the sea-side, where it was at least
posible that something might happen to my advantage,
and, by the same ill-fate that brought me hither, might
bring some other unhappy wretches to the same place; and
though it was scarce probable that any such thin should
ever happen, yet to inclose myself among the hills and
woods in the center of the island, was to anticipate my
bondage, and to render such an affair not only improbable,
but impossible; and that therefore I ought not by any
means to remove. However, I was so enamored of this
place, that I spent much of my time there for- the whole
remaining part of the, month of July; and though, upon

my mind, had, after some time, omitted to distinguish
the weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for the
Sabbath-day, and so did not really know what any of the
days were: but now having cast up the days, as above, I
found I had been there a year; so ' divided it into Weeks,
and set apart every seventh day for a Sabbath; though 1
found, at the end of my account, I had lost a day or two
in my reckoning. A little after this, my ink beginning to
fail me, 1 contented myself to use it more sparingly; and
to write down only the most remarkable events of my life,
without continuing a daily memorandum of other things.
The rainy season and the dry season began now to ap-
pear regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to
provide {or them accordingly; but I bought all my experi-
ence before I had it; and what I am going to relate was
one of the most discouraging experiments that I had made
at all.
1 have mentioned that I had saved a few ears of barley
and rice, which 1 had so surprisingly found sprung u , as
I thought, oi themselves. I believe there were a out
thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley; and now
I thought it a proper time to sow it after the rains; the sun
being in its southern position, going from me. Accord-
ingly I dug a piece of ground, as well as I could, with my
wooden spade; and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my
grain; but as I was sowing, it casually occurred to my

not know when was the proper time for it; so 1 sowed
about two thirdwof the seed, lca'viug about a handful of
each: and it was a great comfort to me afterward that 1
did so, for not one grain of what I sowed this time came to
anything; for the dry month following, and the earth hav-
ing thus had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no
t
moisture to assist its growth, and never came up at all till
the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it

grow, which I easily imagined was from the drought, I
sought for a moister piece of ground to make another trial
in; and I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower,
and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little before
the vernal equinox. This having the rainy months of
March and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly,
and yielded a very good crop; but having only art of the
seed left, and not daring to sow all that I had, got but a
small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to
above half a peek of each ind. But by this experiment I
was made master of my business, and knew exactly when
was the proper time to sow; and that I might expect two
seed-times, and two harvests, every year. '
While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery,
which was of use to me afterward. As soon as the rains
were over, and the weather began to settle, which was
about the mouth of November, I made a visit up the coun—
try to my bower; where, though I had not been for‘some
months, yet I found all things just as I had left them.
The circle or double hedge that 1 had made was not only

some trees that row thereabouts, were all shot out and
grown with long ranches, as much as a willow-tree usual-

I FOUND now that the seasons of the year might eneral-

but into the rain seasons and the dry seasons, which were

then to the south of the Line.
The rainy seasons held sometimesJr nger and sometimes
shorter, as the winds happened to blow; butthis was the
general observation I made. After I had'found, by experi-
ence, the ill conse uenees of being abroad in the rain, I
took care to furnigh myself with provisions beforehand,
that I might not be obliged to go out; and I sat within
doors as much as possible during the wet months. This
time I foun much employment, and very suitable also to
the time; for I found great occasion for many things which
I had no way to furnish myself with but by hard labor and
constant ap lication: particularly, I tried many ways to
make mysel a basket: ‘but all the twigs I could get lor the
purpose rovedso brittle that they would do nothing. It
proved 0 excellent advantage to me now, that when I was
a boy, 1 used to take great delight in standing at a basket-
,maker’s in the town where m fatherlived, to see them
make their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are,

how they worked those things, and sometimes lending a

came into my mind, that t e twigs of that tree from
whence I cut my stakes that grew might ossiblybe as
gough as the sallows, willows, and osiers, in gland; and
resolved to try. Accordingly, the next day, I went to
my country-house, as I called it; and cutting some of the
smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I
could desire: whereupon 1 came the next time prepared
with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I soon found,
for there was great plenty of them. These 1 set up to dry

of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how
to supply taro other wants. I had no vessel to hold any-
thing that was liquid, except two runlets, which were almost ‘
full of rum; and some glass bottles, some of the common
size, and others (which were case bottles) square, for the
holding of waters, spirits, etc. I had not so much as a pot
to boil anything; except a great kettle, which I saved out
of the ship, and which was too big for such use as I desired
it, viz., to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itsell.
The second thing I would Iain have had, was a tobacco-
ipe; but it was impossible for me to make one; however,
ffound a oontrivauce for that too at last. I employed
myself in planting my second row of stakes or' piles, and
also in this wicker-Working all the summer or dry season;
when another business took me up more time than it could

opening quite to the sea, on the other side of the island. I
now reached to travel quite across to the seashore, on that
side: so taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a
larger quantity of powder and shot than usual; with two
biscuitwzakes, and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch,

I could not tell what part of the world this might be;
otherwise than that I knew it must be part of America;

the Spanish dominions; and perhaps was all inhabited by
savages, where, if I should have landed, 1 had been in a
worse condition than I was now. I therefore acquiesced in

with fruitless wishes of being there. Besides, after some
pause upon this affair, I considered that if this land was
the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or other,
see some vessel pass or repass one way or other; but if not,
then it was the savage coast between the Spanish country
and the Brazils, whose inhabitants are indeed the worst of
savages; for they are cannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not
to murder and devour all human beings that fall into their
hands.
With these considerations, walking very leisurely for-
ward, I found this side of the island, where 1 now was,

I killed several. But I had no need to be venturous; for
I had no want of food, and of that which was very good
too; especially these three sorts, viz., goats, pigeons, and
turtle, or tortoise. With these, added to my grapes,
Lesdenhall Market could not have furnished a table better
than I, in proportion to the com any; and though my case
was deplorable enough, yet I h great cause for thankful-
,iess; as I was not driven to any extremities for food, but
had rather plenty, even to dainties.
I never traveled on this journey above two miles outright
{u a day, or thereabout; but I took so many turns and re-
runs to see what discoveries 1 could make, that I came
weary enough to the place where I resolved to sit down for
the night; and then I either reposed myself in a tree, or
surrounded myself with a row of stakes, set upright in the
ground, either from one tree to another, or so as no wild
creature could come at me without waking me.
As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was sur riscd to
see that I had taken up my lot on the worst si e of the
jisland; for here indeed the shore was covered with innum-

I concluded I would go home again, and that the next

unless I knew very well the position of the sun at that time
of the day. And it happened to my further misfortune
that the weather proved hazy for three or {our days while
I was in this valley; and not being able to see the sun, I

In this journey my dog sur rised a youn kid, and
seized upon it; and running to ta e hold of it, caught it
and saved it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to
bring it home if I could; for I had often been musing
whether it might not be possible .to get a kid or two, and
so raise a breed of tame goals, which might supply me
when my powder and shot should be all spent. I made a
collar for this little creature, and with a. string which I had
made of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about me,

very impatient to be at home, from whence I had been ab-
sent ahove a month. '
1 can not express what a satisfaction it was to me to
come into my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-
bcd. This little wandering journey, without a settled place
of abode, had been so unpleasant to me that my own
house, as I called it to myself, was a perfect settlement to
me, compared to that; and it rendered everything about
me so comfortable that I resolved I would never go a great
way from it again while it should be my lot to stay on the
island.

1fter my long journey; during which, most of the time
was taken up in the weighty aifair of making a cage for
my Poll, who began now to be more domestic, and to be
mighty well acquainted with me. Then I began to think,
of the poor kid which I had penned within my little circle,
and resolved to fetch it home, or give it some food; accord-
ingly I went, and found it where I left it (for indeed it
could not get out), but was almost starved for want of
food. I went and cut boughs of trees, and branches of

so tame with being hungry that I had no need to have tied
it, for it followed me like a dog; and as I continually fed
it, the creature became so loving, so gentle, and so fond,
that it was from that time one of my domestics also, and
would never leave me afterward. '
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come,
and I kept the 30th of September in the same solemn man-
,ner as before, being the anniversary of my landing on the
island, having now been there two years, and no more

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more
happy the life I now led was, with all its miserable circum-
stances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led\ all
the past part oil my days; and now 1 chan ed both my
sorrows and my joys; my ver desires alter , my affec-
tions changed their gusts, an my delights were perfectly

the two years past. Before. as I walked about, either on
my hunting, or for viewing the country, the anguish of
my soul at my condition would break out upon me on a
sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think
of the woods, the mountains, the deserts 1 was in; and
how 1 was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal bars and
bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without
redemption 1n the midst of the greatest composures of
my mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and
make me wring my hands and weep like a child; some-
times it would take me in the middle of my work, and I
would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
ground for an hour or two together; this was still worse to
me; but if I could burst into tears or give vent to my feel-
ings by words, it would go otf, and my grief being ex-
hausted, would abate.
v But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts;
I daily read the word of God, and applied all the comforts
of it to my present state. One morning, being very sad,
I opened the Bible upon these words, “ I will never leave
thee, nor forsake thee;” immediately it occurred that these
words were to me, why else should they be directed in such
a manner, just at the moment when I was mourning oyer
my condition, as one forsaken of God and man? Well,
then, said I, if God does not forsake me, of what ill conse-
quence can it be, or what matters it, though the world
should forsake me; seeing, on the other. hand, if 1 had all
the world, and should lose the favor and blessing of God,
there would be no comparison in the loss?
From-this moment I began to conclude in my mind that
it was possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken,
solitary condition than it was probable 1 should ever have
been in any other particular state of the world; and with
this thought 1 was going to give thanks to God for bring-
in me to this place. I know not what it was, but some-i
thine shocked my mind at that thought, and I durst not
spea the words. How canst thou be such a hypocrite,
said I, even audibly, to pretend to be thankful for a con-
dition, which, however thou mayest endeavor to be con-
tented with, then wouldst rather pray heartily to be de-
livered from? Here I stopped; but though I could not
say I thanked God for being here, yet I sincerely gave

which generally took me up three hours every morning,
when it did not rain; thirdly, Ordering, curing, preserv-

considered, that in the middle of the day, when the sun
was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too great to
stir out; so that about four hours in the evening was all

may judge the labor of my hands in such a piece of work;
but labor and patience carried me through that, and many
other things; 1 only observe this in particular, to show the
reason why so much of my time went away with so little
work, viz., that what might be a little to be done with help
and tools, was a vast labor, and required a prodigious time
to do alone, and by hand. Notwithstanding this, with
patience and labor I went through many things; and, in-
deed, everything that my circumstances made necessary for
me to do, as will appear by what follows,
I was now in the months of November and December,
expecting my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had
manurcd or dug up for them was not great; for, as 1 ob-
served, my seed of each was not above the quantity of half
a peck, having lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry
season; but now my crop promised very' well; when, on a
sudden, I found 1 was in dallgil‘ of losing it all again by
enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce possible to
104 aosrsson causes.
I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay
in it night and. day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so
close, that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk.
I saw no remedy for this, but by making an inclosure
about it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil
and the more because it required speed. However, as my
arable land was but small, suited to my crop, I got it tol-
erably well fenced in about three weeks’ time; and shoot-
ing some of the creatures in the day-time, I'set my dog to
guard it in the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate,
where he would stand and bark all night long; so in a lit-
tle time the enemies forsook the place, and the corn grew
very strong and well, and began to ripen space.
But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was
in the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now,
when it was in the ear; for going along by the place to see
how it throve, 1 saw my little crop surrounded with fowls,

among them (for I always had my gun with me); I had no
sooner shot but there rose up a little cloud of fowls, which
I had not seen at all, from among the corn itself.
This touched me sensiblv, for I foresaw that in afew
days they would devour an my hopes; that I should lie

starved, and nevvr be able to raises crop at all; and what
to do I could not tell; however, I resolved not to lose my
corn, if possible, though I should watch it night and day.

already done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of it;
but that as it was yet too green for them the loss was not
so great, but that the remainder was likely to be a good
crop, if it could be saved.
I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away I
could easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about
me, as if they only waited till 1 was gone away; and the
event proved it to be so; for as I walked off, as if gone, I
was no sooner out of their sight than they dropped down,
one by one, into the corn again. I was so. provoked that I
could not have patience to stay till more came on, know-
ing that every grain they eat now was, as it might be said,
a peck lost! to me in the consequence; so coming up to the

fowls not only never came to the corn, but, in short, they
for-sock all that part of the island, and I could never see a
bird near the place as long as my scare-crows hung there.
This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and about the
' latter end of December, which was our second harvest of
the year, I reaped my com.
I was sadly‘dput to for a scythe or sickle to out it down;
and all I coul do was to make one as well as I could, cut

seed I had near twoaiushcls of rice, and above two ushels ’

no measure.
However, this was great encouragement to me, and I

I 1
neither knew how to grind or make meal of my corn, or
indeed how to clean it and part it; nor if made into meal,
how to make bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I
knew not how to bake it; these things being added to my
desire of having a good quantity for store, and to secure a
constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of this crop,
but to preserve it all for seed against the next season; and,
in the meantime, to employ all my study and hours of
.working to accomplish this great work of providing myself
with corn and bread.
It might be truly said that now I worked for my bread.
It is a little wonderful, and what I believe few people have
thought much upon, viz., the strange multitude of little
things necessary in the providing, producing, curing,

seed-corn which, as 1 have said, came up unexpectedly, and
indeed to a surprise.
First, I had no plow to turn up the earth; n0 spade or
shovel to dig it; well, this I conquered by making a wooden
spade, as I observed before; but this did my work in but a
wooden manner; and though it cost me a great many days
to make it, yet, for want of iron, it not only wore out the
sooner, but made my work the harder, and performed it
much worse. However, this 1 bore with, and was content
to work it out with atience, and bear with the badness of
the performance. hen the corn was sown I had no har-
row, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a great
heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be
called, rather than rake or harrow it. When it was grow-
ing and grown, I have observed already how many things
I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow 0r reap it, cure and
carry it home, thresh, part it from the chaff, and save it;
then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast
and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it; and
yet all these things I did without, as will be observed; and
the corn was an inestimable comfort and advantage to me;
all this, as I said, made everything laborious and tedious to
me, but that there was no help for; neither was my time
so much loss to me, because, as I had divided it, a certain
part of it was every day appointed to these works; and as I
resolved to use none of the corn for bre ad till I had a
greater quantity by me, I had the next six months to apply
myself wholly, by labor and invention, to furnish myself
with utensils proper for performing all the operations nec-

therefore, was not my work, but an assistant to my work;
for now, as I said, I had a great employment upon my

Iwanted much, but knew not where to come at them;

to temper it, to ring it home, and work it, I could not
make above two large earthen ugly things (I can not call
them jars) in about two months’ labor.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard,
I lifted them ver gently up, and set them down again in
two great wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose for
them, that they might not break; and as between the pot
and the basket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed it

to stand always dry, I thought would hold'my dry corn,

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers
of such a condition, and that I might fall into the hands of
savages, and perhaps such as I might have reason to think
for worse than the lions and tigers of Africa, that if I once
came in their power, I should run a hazard of more than a
thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of being
eaten; for I had heard that the people of the Carribean
coast were cannibals, or man-eaters; and I knew, by the
latitude, that I could not be far off from that shore.
Then supposing they were not cannibals, yet that they
might kill me, as they had many Europeans who had fallen
into their hands, even when they were ten or twenty
together; much more I, who was but one, and could make
little or no defense; all these things, I say, which I ought
to have considered well of, and did cast up in my thoughts

my head ran mightily upon the thought of getting over to
the shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with
the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a
thousand miles on the coast of Africa: but this was in
vain: then I thought I would go and look at our ship’s
boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the shore a

the boat would have done very well, and I might have gone
back into the Brazils with her easily enough; but I might
have foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her
upright upOn her bottom, than I could remove the island:
however, went to the woods, and cut levers and rollers.
and brought them to the boat, resolving to try what I could
do; suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn her
down, and repair the damage she had received, she would
be a very good beat, and 1 might venture to sea in her.
I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece or fruitless toil,
and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it: at last,

strength, I fell to digging away the sand, to undermine
her, and so as to make her fall down, setting pieces of
wood to thrust and guide her right in the fall. But when
] haddene this, I was unable to stir her up again, or to
get under her, much less to move her forward toward the
water; sol was forced to give it over: and yet, though I
gave over the hopes of the beat, my desire to venture over
the main increased, rather than diminished, as the means
for it seemed impossible. ‘
At length, I began to think whether it was not possible '.
- to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of
those climates make, even without tools, or, as I might
say, without hands, of the trunk of a great tree. 'l‘hisl
not only thought possible, but easy, and pleased myself ex~
tremely with the idea of making it, and with my having
much more convenience for it than any of the Negrws or
Indians; but not at all considering the particular incon-

than all the consequences of want of tools could be to

my tree, and with much trouble cut it down, and might be
able with my tools to how and dub the outside into the
proper shape of a boat, and burn or out out the inside to
make it hollow, so as to make a boat of it—if, after all
this, I must leave it just where 1 found it, and was not able
to launch it into the water?

upon my mind of my circumstances while I was making

get it off the land; and it was really, in its own nature,

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely
delighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than
ever I saw a canoe or a periagua that was made of one tree,
in my life. Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may be
sure; and there remained nothin but to get it into the
water; which, had I accomplishe , 1 make no question but '
1 should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most un-
likely to be performed, that ever was undertaken. v
But all my devices to get it into the water failed me;
though they cost me inexpressible labor too. It lay about

great reluctancy, I was at length obliged to give over also.

times past, I remember that there was a strange concur-
rence of days in the various providences which befell me,
and which, if I had been superstitiously inclined to observe
a days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had reason to have
looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.
First, I had observed, that the same day that I broke
away from my father and my friends, and ran away to
Hull, in order to go to sea, the same day afterward I was
taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and made a slave; the
same day of the year that I escaped out o! the wreck of
the ship in Yarmouth Roads, that same day, years after-
ward, I made my escape from Sallee in the boat: and the
same day of the year I was born on, viz., the 30th of Sep-
tember, that same day I had my life so miraculously saved
twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore in this
island: so that my wicked life and my solitary life began
both on one day.
The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my
bread, 1 mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship:
this I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself
hut one cake of bread a day for above a year; and yet I

was quite without bread for near a year before 1 got any
corn of my own; and great reason I had to be thankful
that I had any at all, the getting it being, as has been al-
ready observed, next to miraculous.
My clothes, too, began to decay mightily: as to linen, I
had none for a great while, except some checked shirts
which I found in the chests of the other seamen, and which
1 carefully preserved, because many times 1 could bear no
clothes on but'a shirt, and it was a very great help to me
that I had, among all the men’s clothes of the ship, almost
three dozen of shirts. There were also, indeed, several
thick watchcoats of the seamen’s which were left, but they
were too hot to wear: and though it is true tbatethe
weather was so violently hot that there was no need of
clothes, yet 1 could not go quite naked, no. though I had
been inclined to it, which I was not, nor could I abide the
thought of it, though I was all alone. The reason why I
coul not go uite naked was, 1 could not bear the heat of
the sun so well when quite naked as with some clothes on;
nay, the very heat frequently bllstered my skin: whereas,
with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and whist-
ling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than Without it; No
more could I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the
sun without a cap or hat; the heat of the sun heating with
such violence as it does in that place, would give me the
headache presently, by darting so directly upon my head,
without a cap or hat on, so that I could not bear it,
whereas, it I put on my hat, it would resently go away.
,1, Upon these views, I began to consi er about putting the
few rags I bed, which I called clothes, into some order. 1
had worn out all the waisteoats I had, and my business
was now to try if I could not make jackets out of the great
watch-coats that I had by me, and with such other materials
as I had; so I set to work a-tailoring, or rather, indeed, a
botching, for I made most piteous work of it. However,
1 made shift to make two or three new waistooats, which I
hoped would serve me a great while. As for breeches, or
drawers, ‘1 made but a very sorry shift indeed, till after-
ward.

ures that I killed, I mean four-footed ones; and I had

After this I spent a great deal of time and pains to make
me an umbrella; I was indeed in great want of one, and
had a great mind to make one; I had seen them made in
the Brazils, where they were very useful in the great heats
which are there, and I felt the heats every jot as great

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entire-

myself wholly upon the disposal of His rovidence. This

broad; accordingly, the smallness of my boat assisted to
put an end to that design, and now I thought no more of
it. As I had a beat, my next design was to make a cruise
round the island; for as 1 had been on the other side in
one place, crossing, as I have already described it, over the
land, so the discoveries I made in that little journe made
me very eager tosee other parts of the coast; an new I

a little voyage upon the sea, but never went far out, nor
far from the little creek. At last, being eager to view the
circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved 11 on my
cruise; and accordingly, I victualed my shi for t e voy-
age, utting in two dozen of leaves (cakes should rather
call t cm) of barley bread, an earthen pot full of parched
rice (a food I eat a great deal of), a little bottle of rum,
half a goat, and powder and shot for killing more, and two
large watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned before, I
had saved out of the seamen’s chests; these 1 took, one to
lie upon, and the other to cover me in the night.
It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my
reign, or my ca tivity, which you lease, that set out on
this voyage, an I found it much longer than I expected;
for though the island. itself was not very large, yet when I
came to the east side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks
lie out about two leagues into the sea, some above water,
some under it, and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry
half a league more, so that I was obliged to go a great way
out to sea to double the point.

upon this bill, I believe it Would have been so; for there
was the same current on the other side the island, only
that it set off at a further distance, and I saw there was a
strong eddy under the shore; so I had nothing to do but

an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing
pretty fresh at E.S.E., and that being just contrary to the
said current, made a great breach of the sea upon the
point ,- so that it was not safe for me to keep too close to the
shore, for the breach, nor to go too far cit, because of the
stream. '
The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated
overnight, the sea was calm, and I ventured; but I am a
warning-piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots; for no
sooner was I come to the point, when I was not even my
boat’s length from the shore, but I found myself in a great
depth otwatcr, and a current like the sluice of a mill: it

the boat; and I had a great jar of fresh water, that is to

shore, no mainland or island, for a thousand leagues at
least?
And now I saw how easy it was tor the Providenoe of
God to make even the most miserable condition of man-
kind worse. Now I looked back upon my desolate, solitary
island as the most pleasant place in the world; and all the
happiness my heart could wish for was to be but there
again. 1 stretched out In hands to it, with eager wishes:
Ob, ha py desert! said 1, shall never see thee more. Oh,
misera le creature! whither am I going? Then 1 re-
roaehed myself with my unthankful temper, and how I
18d repined at my solitary condition; and now what would
1 give to be on shore there again! Thus we never see the
true state of our condition till it is illustrated to us by its
coutrsries, nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by
the want of it. It is scarce possible to imagine the con-
sternation lwas now in, being driven from my beloved
island (for so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide
been, almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of
ever recovering it again. However, I worked hard, till in-
deed my strength was almost exhausted, and kept my boat
as much to the northward, that is, toward the side of the
current which the eddy lay on, as possibly 1 could; when
about noon, as the sun assed the meridian, I thought I
felt a little breeze of wind) in my face, springing up from
S. S. E. This cheered my heart a little, and especially when,
in about half an hour more, it blow a pretty gentle gale.
B this time I was got at a frightful distance from the
is and, and had the least cloudy or hazy weather inter-
vened, I had been undone another way too; for 1 had no
compass on board, and should never have known how to
have steered toward the island, if 1 bad but once lost sight
of it; but the weather continuing clear, I applied myself
to get up my mast again, and spread my sail, standing
away to the north as much as possible, to get out of the
current. \
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began
to stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of the. water
some alteration of the current was near; for where the cur-
rent was so strong the water was foul; but perceiving the
water clear, I found the current abate, and presently I
found to the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea
upon some rocks; these rocks I found caused the current

to part again, and as the main strem of it ran away more
southerl , leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the other
returnedy by the repulse of the rocks, and made a strong
eddy, which ran back again to the north-west, with a very

'1‘ ey who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to
them upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just
going to murder them, or who have been in such-like ex-
tremitie, may guess what my present surprise of joy was,
and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy;
and the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail
to it, running cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong
tide or eddy under foot. '
This eddy carried me about a league in my way back
again, directly toward the island, but about two leagues
more to the northward than the current which carried me

myself 0 n to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the
other on of the island, opposite to that whichI went out
from.
When I had made something more than a league of way
by the help of this current or eddy, 1 found it was s eat,
and served me no further. ‘ However, 1 found that eing

which had hurried me away, and that on the north, which
lay about a lea no on the other side; I sa , between these
two, in the waie of the island, I found t e water at least
still, and running no way; and having still a breeze of wind
fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the island,
though not making such fresh way as I did before.
About four o’clock in the evening, being then within a
league of the island, I found the point of the rocks which
ncvasioned this disaster stretching out, as is described be-

southerly, had, of course, made another eddy to the north;
and this 1 found very strong, but not directly setting the
way my course lay, which was due west, but almost full
north. However, having a fresh gale I stretched across
this eddy, slanting north-west; and in about an hour came
within about a mile of the shore, where, it being smooth
water, I soon get to land. ‘
When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God
thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all
'M
_i. __ ,V,_ w
thou hts ‘of deliverance by my boat; and refreshing
myse f with such things as I had, 1 brought my boat close
to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied under some
trees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with
the labor and fatigue of the voyage.
' I was now at a great loss which way to get home with
my boat; I had run so much hazard, and knew too much
of the case, to think of attempting it by the way 1 went
out; and what might be at the other side (I mean the west
side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more
ventures; so I only resolved in the morning to make m
way westward along the shore, and see if there was no cree
where I mi ht lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have
her again, i I wanted her. In about three miles, or there-
about, coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet or
bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till it came to a.
very little rivulet or brook, where I found a very conveni-
ent harbor for my boat, and where she lay as if she had
been in a little dock made on purpose for her. Here I put
in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore,
to look about me, and see where I was. '
I soon found 1 had but a little passed by the place where
I had been before, when I traveled on foot to that shore;
so taking nothing out of my boat but my gun and um-
brella, for it was exceeding hot, I began my march. The
way was comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had '
been upon, and I reached my old bower in ,the evening,
where found everything standing as I had left it; for I
always kept it in good order, being, as I said before, my
country-house.
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to
rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep; but

upon the danger I had been in. 1 would have been very
glad to have had my boat again on my side of the island;
but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about. As
to the east side of the island, which I had gone round, I
knew well enough there was no venturing that way; my
very heart would shrink, and my very blood run chill, but
to think of it; and as to the other side of the island, 1 did
not know how it might be there, but supposing the current
ran with the same force against the shore at the east as it
passed by it on the other, I might run the same risk of be-
ing driven down the stream, and carried by the island, as
Ihad been before of being carried away from it; so, with
these thoughts, I contented myself to be without any boat,
though it had been the product of so many months’ labor
to make it, and of so many more to get it into the sea.
In this government of my tem er I remained near a
year, lived a very sedate, retired li e, as you may well sup-
pose; and my thoughts being very much composed, as to
my condition, and (fully comforted in resignin myself to
the dispositions of Providence, I thought I liv really very
happily in all things, except that of society.
I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic ex-
ercises which my necessities put me upon applying myself
to; and I believe I could, upon occasion, have made a Very
good carpenter, especially considering how few tools I had.

He rears a Flock of Goats—His Dairy.——His Domestic Habits and
Style of Living—Increasing Prosperity.
BEING now in the eleventh year of my residence, and as
I have said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to
study some art to trap and snare the goats, to see whether
I could not catch some of them alive; and particularly, I
wanted a she-goat great with young. For this purpose I
made snares to hamper them; and I do believe they were
more than once taken in them; but my tackle was not
good, for I had no wire, and 1 always found them broken,
and my bait devoured. At length I resolved to try a pit-
fall ; so I dug several large pits in the earth, in places where
I had observed the goats used to feed, and over those pits I
placed hurdles, of my own making too, with a great wei ht
upon them; and several times I put ears of barley and ry
rice, without setting the trap; and 1 could easily perceive
that the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn, for 1
could see the marks of their feet. At length I set three
traps in one night, and going the next morning, 1 found
them all standing, and yet the bait eaten and gone. This
was very discouraging; however, I altered my traps, and,
not to trouble you with particulars, going one morning to
see my traps, 1 found in one of them a large old he-goat,
and in one of the others three kids, a male and two females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he

I wanted; I could have killed him, but that was not my
business, nor would it answer my end; so 1 even let him
out, and he ran away, as if he had been frightened out of
his wits. But 1 had forgot then what I learned after-
ward, that hunger will tame a lion. If I had let him stay
there three or four days without food, and then have car.
/ ried him some water to drink, and then a little corn, he
would have been as tame as one of the kids; for they are
mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they are well
used. However, for the present I let him go, knowing no
better at that time; then LWQI'E tg_ the three kids, and

some inclosed piece of ground, well fenced, either with

there was likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for

Those who understand such inclosures will think I had
very little contrivance, when I pitched upon a place very
proper for all these (being a plain open piece of meadow
and, or savanna, as our people call it in the western col-
onies) which had two or three little drills of fresh water in
it, and at one end was very woody; I say, they will smile
at my forecast, when I shall tell them, I began my inclos-
ing this piece of ground in such a manner that my hedge
or pale must have been at least two miles about. Nor was

deed, in the beginning, I did not so much as think of, and
which, when it came into my thoughts, was really an agree-
able surprise; for now I set up my dairy, and had some—
times a gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature,

naturally how to make use of it, so I, that had never

and miscarriages, made me both butter and cheese at last,
and also salt (though I found it partly made to my hand
by the heat of the sun upon some of the rocks of the sea),
and never wanted it afterward. How mercifully can our
Creator treat His creatures, even in those conditions in
which they seemed» to be overwhelmed in destruction!
How can He sweeten the bitterest providences, and give us
cause to praise him for dungeons and prisons! What a

It would have made a stoic smile to have seen me and
my little family sit down to dinner. There was my

among all my subjects.

too much._ .
1 was something impatient, as I have observed, to have
the use of my boat, though very loath to run any more
hazards; and therefore sometimes I sat contrivina' ways to
get her about the island, and at other times I sat myself
down contented enough without her. But I had a strange
uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the
island, where, as I have said, in my last ramble, I went up
the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the current set,
that 1 might see what I had to do: this inclination in-
creased upon me every day, and at length I resolved to
travel thither by land, following the edge of the shore. 1

one side, and one on the other. I had another belt, not so
broad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung over
my shoulder; and at the end of it, under my left arm,
hung two pouches, both made of goat’s skin too: in one of
which hung my powder, in the other my shot. At my
back I carried my basket, and on my shoulder my gun;

had about me, next to my gun. As for.my face, the color

went over the land, a nearer way, to the same height that
I was upon before; when looking forward to the point of
the rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to double
with my boat, as is said above, I was surprised to see the
sea all smooth and quiet; no'rippling, no motion, no cur-
rent, any more than in any other places. I was at a
strange loss to understand this, and resolved to spend some
time in observing it, to see if nothing from the sets of
the tide had occasioned it; but I was presently convinced
how it was, viz., that the tide of ebb, setting from the i.
west, and joining with the current of waters from some
great river on the shore: must be the occasion of this cur-
rent; and that according as the wind blew more forcibly
from the west, or from the north, this current came nearer,
or went further from the shore: for waiting thereabouts
till evening, I went up to the rock again, and then the
tide of ebb being made, 1 plainly saw the current again as
before, only that it ran further 01f, being near half a league y
from the shore; whereas, in my case, it set close upon the i
shore, and hurried me and my canoe along with it, which,
at another time, it would not have-done.
This observation convinced me, that I had nothing to do

- I might very easily bring my boat about the island again:
but when I began to think of putting it in practice, I had
such a terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the
danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again
with any patience; but, on the contrary, I took up another
resolution, which was more safe, though more laborious;
and this was, that I would build, or rather make me
another periagua or canoe; and so have one for one side of
the island, and one for the other.

to our sea bedding, which I had saved, and a great watch-

I'r happened one day, about noon, going toward m
boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man s
naked foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen
in the sand. I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had
seen an apparition: I listened, I looked round me, but_ I
could hear nothing, nor see anything; I went up to a us-

sion but that one. 1 went to it again to see if there were
any more, and to observe if it might not be my fancy; but
there was no room for that, for there was exactly the print
of a foot, toes, heel, and every part of a foot: how it came-

I» I slept none that night: the further I was from the occa-'
sion of my fright, the greater my apprehensions were;
which is something contrary to the nature of such things,
and especially to the usual practice of all creatures in fear;
but I was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas of
the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations
to myself, even though I was now a great way 01f it.
Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil, and reason
joined in with me upon this supposition; for how should
any other thing in human shape come into the place?
Where was the vessel that brought them? What marks
were there of any other footsteps? And how was it possi-
ble a man should come there? But then to think that
Satan should take human shape upon him in such a place,
where there could be no manner of occasion for it, but to
leave the print of his foot behind him, and that even for
no purpose too, for he could not be sure I should see it--

entirely: all this seemed inconsistent with the thing itself,
and with all the notions we usually entertain of the sub-
tlety of the devil.
Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me
out of all apprehensions of its being the devil; and I pres-
ently concluded, then, that it must be some more danger-
ous creature, viz., that it must be some of the savages of
the main land over against me, who had wandered out to
sea in their canoes, and, either driven by the currents or
by contrary winds, had made the island, and had been on

might imagine; that although there were no stated inhabit-

- pretty large space between them and my wall, that I might
have room to see an enemy, and they might have no shelter
from the young trees, if they attempted to approach my
. outer wall.
Thus, in two years’ time, I had a thick grove; and in

growing so monstrous thick and strong, that it was indeed
perfectly impassable; and no men, of what kind soever,
would ever imagine that there was anything beyond it,
much less a habitation. As for the way which I proposed
to myself to go in and out (for I left no avenue,) it was by
setting two ladders, one to a part of the rock which was
low, and then broke in, and left the room to place another
0


ladder upon ' that: so when the two ladders were taken
down, no man living could come down to me without do-
ing himself mischief; and if they had come down, they
were still on the outside of my outer wall.
Thus I took all the measures human prudence could
suggest for my own preservation; and it will be seen, at
length, that they were not altogether without just reason,
though I foresaw nothing at that time mere than my more
fear suggested to me. ' , >
While this was doing, 1 was not altogether careless of
my other affairs: for I had a great concern upon me for
my little herd of goats; they were not only a ready supply t

tired parts of the island; and I pitched upon one, which
was as private, indeed, as my heart could wish for: it was
a little damp piece of ground, in the middle of the hollow
and thick woods, where, as is observed, 1 almost lost my-
self once before, endeavoring to come‘ back that way from
the eastern part of the island. Here I found a clear piece
of land, near three acres, so surrounded with woods that
it was almost an i'nclosure by nature; at least, it did not
want near so much labor to make it so as the other pieces
of ground 1 had worked so hard at, ‘ -

lay, I removed ten young she-goats and two he-goats to
this piece; and when they were there, I continued to per-
fect the fence, till 1 had made it as secure as the other,
which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up
more time by a great deal. All this labor 1 was at the ex-
pense of purely from my apprehensions on account of the
print of a man’s feet which I had seen; for, as yet, I never
saw any human creature come 'near the island; and 1 had
now lived two years under this uneasiness, which, indeed,
made my life much less comfortable than it was before, as
may be well imagined by any who know what it is to live
in the constant snare of the fear of man. And this I must
observe, with grief too, that the disoomposure of my mind
had too great impressions also upon the religious part of
my thoughts: for the dread and terror of falling into the
hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that
I seldom found myself in a due temper for application to '
my Maker, at least not with the sedate calmness and resig-
nation of soul which 1 was wont to do: I rather prayed to
148 ' nonmsou causoai
rounded with danger, and in expectation every 111 ht of
being murdered and devoured before morning; and must
testify from my experience, that a temper of peace, thank-
fulness, love and affection, is much the more proper frame
for prayer than that of terror and discomposure; and that
under the dread of mischief impending, a man is no more
148 ' nonmsou causoai
God, than he is for a repentance on a sick-bed; for these
148 ' nonmsou causoai
and the discomposure of the mind must necessarily be as
great a disability as that‘of .the body, and much greater:

praying to God being properly an act of the mind, not
of the body.
But to go on: after I had thus secured one part of my
little living stock, I went about the whole island, searching
for another private place to make such another deposit;
when, wandering more to the west point of: the island than
I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I thought I
saw a boat upon the sea, at a great distance. I had found
_ a perspective glass or two in one of the seamen’s chests,
which I saved out of our ship, but I had it not about me;
and this was so remote, that I could not tell what to make
of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able to
hold to look any longer: whether it was a boat or not, I do
not know, but as 1 descended from the hill 1 could see no
more of it; so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more
out without a perspective glass in my pocket. When 1
was come down the hill to the end of the island, where, in-
deed, 1 had never been before, I was presently convinced
that the seeing the print of a man’s 'foot was not such a
trange thing in the island as I imagined: and, but that it
was a special providence that l was cast upon the side of
the island where the savages never came, I should easily
have known that nothing was more frequent than for the
canoes from the main, when they happened to be a little
too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island
for harbor: likewise, as they often met and fought in their
canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners, would
bring them over to this shore, where, according to their
dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and
eat them; of which hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said
above, being the south-west point of the island, 1 was per-
fectly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible for me to
express the horror of my mind, at seeing. the shore spread
with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies;
and, particularly, 1 observed a place where there had been

where I supposed the savage wretches had sat down to
their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fellow-
creatures.

entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for
a long while: all my apprehensions were buried in the

thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and
the error of the degeneracy of human nature, which,
though I had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a
view of before: in short, I turned away my face from the
horrid spectacle; my stomach grew sick, and I was just at
the point of fainting, when nature discharged the disorder
from my stomach: and having vomited with uncommon
violence, 1 was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay
in the place a moment; so 1 got me up the hill again with
all the speed 1 could, and walked on toward my own habi-
tation.
When 1 came a little out of that part of the island, L

though I had esteemed my present condition very miser-

could suffer. I
In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle,
and began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my
circumstances, than ever I was before: for I observed that
these wretches never came to this island in search of what
they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not
expecting, anything here, and having often, no doubt, been

thing to their purpose. I knew I had been here now
almost eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps of
human creature there before; and I might be eighteen
years more as entirely concealed as 1 was now, if I did not
discover myself to them, which I had no manner of occa-
sion to do; it being my only business to keep myself en-
tirely concealed where 1 was, unless I found a better sort
of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to. Yet
lentertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches
that I have been speaking of, and 0f the wretched inhu-
man custom of their devouring and eating each other up,
\
that I continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my
own circle, for almost two years after this; when I say my
own circle,l mean by it my three plantations, viz., my
‘ castle, my country seat, which 1 called my bower, and my
inclosure in the woods: nor did I look after this for any
other use than as an inclosure for my goats; for the aver-
sion which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was
such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing the
devil himself. I did not so much as go to look after my
boat all this time, but began rather to think of making me
another; for 1 could not think of ever making any more
attempts to bring the other boat round the island to me,
test 1 should meet with some of these creatures at sea, in
which if I happened to have fallen into their hands, I
knew what would have been my lot.
Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that 1 was in
no danger of being discovered by these peo le, began to
wear off my uneasiness about them; and I egan to live
just in the same composed manner as before, only with
this difference, that I used more caution, and kept my eyes
more about me, than I did before, lest 1 should happen to
be seen by any of them; and particularly, I was more can-

out of the ship, I always carried them out with me, or at

also furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I had out
of the ship, and made me a belt to hang it on also; so that
I was now a most formidable fellow to leak at when I went
abroad, if you add to the former description of myself, the
particular of two istols, and a great broadsword hanging
at my side in a be t, but without a scabbard.

As in my present\ condition there were not really many
things which I wanted, so, indeed, I thought that the

could never compass; no, though I spent not only many
days, but weeks, nay, months, in attempting it, but to no

make it boil; and yet, with all these t ings wanting, I
verily believe, had not the frights and terrors l was in
about the savages intervened, 1 had undertaken it, and
perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave anything
over without accomplishing it, when once 1 had it in my-
head to begin it. But my invention now ran quite another
way; for, night and day, I could think of nothing but how
I might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel,
bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the victim they
should bring hither to destroy. It would take up a large
volume than this whole work is intended to be, to set down
all the eontrivances 1 hatched, or rather brooded upon, in
my thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at least
frightening them so as to prevent their coming hither any
more; but all this was abortive; nothing could be possible
to take effect, unless I was to be there to do it myself; and

about the size of pistol-bulllts; and the fowling-piece I loaded
with near a handful of swan-shot, of the largest size: I also
loaded my pistols with about four bullets each; and in this
posture, well provided with ammunition for a second and
third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition.
After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and, in
my imagination, put it in practice, I continually made my
tour every morning up to the top of the hill, which was
from my castle, as I called it, about three miles, or more,
to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea, coming
vnear the island, or standing over toward it: but I began to
tire of this hard duty, after I had, for two or three months,
constantly kept my watch, but came always back without
any discovery: there having not, in all that time, been the
least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but on the
whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses could reach every t
way. _
As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out,1
so long also I ke it up the vigor of my design, and my
spirits seemed to e all the while in‘a suitable form for so
outrageous an execution as the killing twenty or thirty
naked savages, for an offense, which I had not at all en-
tered into a discussion of in my thoughts, any further than

to act such horrid things, and receive such dreadful cus-
toms, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned by
Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy; could
have run them into. But now, when, as I have said, I
began to be weary of the fruitless excursion, which I had
made so 1011 and so far every morning in vain, so my
opinion of tie action itself began to alter; and lbegan,
with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what I was

with myself, thus: How do I know what God Himself
judges in this particular case? It is certain these people

tians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners
taken in battle; or more frequently, upon many occasions,
put whole troops of men to the sword, without giving
quarter, though they threw down their arms and "submit-
ted. In the next place, it occurred to me, that although
the usage they gave one another was thus brutish and in-
human, yet it was really nothing to me; these peo le had
done me no injury: that if they attempted me, or saw it
necessary, for my immediate preservation, to fall upon
them, something might be said for it; but that I was "wet

and that the rooting them out of the country is spoken of

who were without principles of tenderness, or the common

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a
kind of a full sto ; and I began, by little and little, to be

ures in my resolution to attack the savages; and that it

to prevent; but that if 1 were discovered and attacked b
them, I knew my duty. On the other hand, I argued wit
myself, that this really was the way not to deliver myself,
but entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was
sure to kill every one that not only should be on shore at
that time, but that should ever come on shore afterward,
if but one of them escaped to tell their country-people
what had happened, they would come over again by thou-
sands torevenge the death of their fellows, and I should
only bring upon myself a 'certain destruction, which, at
present, I had no manner of occasion for. Upon the
whole, ll concluded, that neither in principle nor in policy
I ought, one way or other, to concern myself in this affair;
that my business was, by all possible means, to conceal
myself from them, and not to leave the least signal to them
to guess by that there were any living creatures upon the
island, I mean of human shape. Religion joined in with;
this prudential resolution, and I was convinced now, many?
ways, that I Was perfectly out of my duty when I was lay-
ing all my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent
creatures, I mean innocent as to me. As to the crimes
they were guilty of toward one another, 1 had nothing to
do with them; they were national, and I ought to leave
them to the justice of God, who is the Governor of na-
tions, and knows how, by national punishments, to make
a just retribution for national offenses, and to bring public
judgments upon those who offend in a public manner, by
such ways as best please Him. This appeared so clear to
me now that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me than
that I had not been suffered to_d0 a thing which 1 now saw
so much reason to believe would have been no less a sin
than that of willful murder, if I had committed it; and I
gave most humble thanks on my knees to God, that had
thus delievered me from blood-guiltiness; beseeching Him
to grant me the protection of His Providence, that I might
' not fall into the hands of the barbarians, or that I might
not lay m hands upon them, unless I had a more clear
. call from eaven to do it, in defense of my own life.

SEGTIONV XIX.
Robinson discovers a Cave, which serves him as a Retreat against
the Savages.
IN this disposition 1 continued for near a year after this;
and so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon
these wretches, that in all that time I never once went up
the hill to see whether there were any of them in sight, or
to know whether any of them had been on shore there or
not, that I might not be tempted to renew any of my con-
trivances against-them, or be provoked, by any advantage
which might present itself, to fall upon them; only this I
did, I went and removed my boat, which I had on the
other side of the island, and carried it down to the east end
of the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove, which
1 found under some high rocks, and where I knew, by rea-
son of the currents, the savages durst not, at least would
not, come with their boats upon any account whatever.
With my boat I carried away everything that I had left
there belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare
going thither, viz., a mast and sail which I had made for
her, and a thing like an anchor, but which, indeed, could
not be called either anchor or grapnel; however, it was the
best I could make of its kind; all these I removed, that
there might not be the least shadow of any discovery, or
any appearance of any boat, or of any human habitation,
upon the island. Besides this, I kept myself, as I said,
more retired than ever, and seldom went from my cell,
other than upon my Constant employment, viz., to milk
nosmsou cnusox. 155
which, as it was quite on the other part of the island, was
quite out of danger; for certain it is, that these savage peo-

never wandered off from the coast; and I doubt not but
they might have been several times on shore after my ap-
PI‘LhOHSlOIIS of them had made me cautious, as well as be-

or twenty savages, and found them pursuing me, and by
the swiftness of their running, no possibility of my escap-
ing them? The thoughts (E this sometimes sunk my very
soul within me, and distressed my mind so much that I
could not soon recover it, to think what I should have
done, and how 1 should not only have been unable to resist
them, but even should not have had presence of mind
enough to do what I might have done, much less what
now, after so much consideration and preparation, I might
be able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking on these
things, I would be very melancholy, and sometimes it would
last a great while; but I resolved it all at last, into thank-
fulness to that Providence which had delivered me from so
many unseen dangers, and had kept frmn me those mis—
chiefs which 1 could have no way been the agent in deliver-
ing myself from, because 1 had not the least notion of any
such thing depending, or the least supposition of its being
possible. This renewed a contemplation which often ha

see the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers we
run through in this life; how wonderfully we are delivered
when we know nothing of it; how, when we are in a quan-
dary, as we call it, a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this
way, or that way, a secret hint shall direct us this way,
when we intended to go that way; nay, when sense, our

rule with me, that whenever I found these secret hints or
pressings of mind, to doing or not doing anything that
presented, or going this way or that way, I never failed to
obey the secret dictate; though I knew no other reason for
it than that such a pressure, or such a hint, hung upon
my mind. I could give many examples of the success of
this conduct in the course of my life, but more especially
in the latter part of myinhabiting this unhappy island, be-
sides many occasions which it is very likely I might have
taken notice of it, if 1 had seen with the same eyes then
that I see with now. But it is never too late to be wise;
and I can not but advise all considering men, whose lives
are attended with such extraordinary incidents as mine, or
even though not so extraordinary, not to slight such secret
intimations of Providence, let them come from what invisi-
ble intelligence they will. That I shall not discuss, and
perhaps can not account for; but certainly they are a proof

proof as can never be withstood; of which 1 shall have oe-
casion to give some very remarkable instances in the re-
mainder of my solitary residence in this dismal place.
I believe the reader of this will not think it stran e if I
confess that these anxieties, these constant danger lived
in, and the concern that was new upon me, put an end to
all invention, and to all the contrivanees'that I had laid
for my future accommodations and conveniences. I had
the care of my safety more now upon my hands than that
of my food. I cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of
wood now, for fear the noise I might make should be heard;

and pipes, etc., into my new apartment in the woods,
where, after I had been some time, I found, to my un-

who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.
The.mor.th of this hollow was at the bottom of a great
rock, where by mere accident (I would say, if 1 did not see
abundant reason to ascribe all such things now to Provi-
dence), I was cutting down some thick branches of trees to
make charcoal; and, before I go on, I must observe the
reason of my making this charcoal, which was thus: 1 was
afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I said
before; and yet I could not live there without baking my
‘ bread, cooking my meat, etc.; so I contrived to burn some
wood here, as I had seen done in England, under turf, till

you that I made more haste out than 1 did in, when, look-

but I was almost as much frightened as I was before; for I
heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain,
and it was followed by a broken noise, as of words half ex-
pressed, and then a deep sigh again. 1 stepped back, and
was indeed struck with such a surprise, that it put me into
a cold sweat; and if I had had a hat on my head, I will not
answer for it, that my hair might not have lifted it off.
But still plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and en-
:‘n ,
couraging myself a little with considering that the power
and presence of God was everywhere, and was able to pro-
tect me, upon this I stepped forward again, and by the
ROBINSON causes. 15."
I saw lying on the ground a most monstrous, frightful, old
he-goat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping for
life, and dying, indeed, of mere old age. I stirred him a
little to see if I could get him out, and he essayed to get
up, but was not able to raise himself; and I thought with
myself he might even lie there; for if he had frightened
me, so he would certainly frighten any of the savages, if
any of them should be so hardy as to come in there while
he had any life in him. .'
I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look
round me, when 1 found the cave was but very small, that
is to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in no man-
ner of shape, neither round nor square, no hands having
ever been employed in making it but those of mere Nature.
I observed also that there was a place at the further side of
it that went in further,~but was so low that it required me
to creep upon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither
it went I knew not; so having no candle, I gave it over for
that time, but resolved to come again the next day, pro-
vided with candles and a tinder-box, which I had made of

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large
candles of my own making (for 1 made very good candles
now of goat’s tallow, but was hard set for candle-wick,
usin sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and sometimes the
drie rind of a weed like nettles); and going into this low
place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours, as I have said,
almost ten yards; which, by the way, I thought was a
venture bold enough, considering that I knew not how far
it might go, nor what was beyond it. When I had got

security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought that
was a convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at the dis‘

those things which I was most anxious about to this place;

Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, l hap-
pened to open the barrel of powder which 1 took 11 out of
the sea, and which had, been wet; and I found t at the
water had penetrated about three or four inches into the
powder on every side, which caking and growing hard, had
preserved the inside like a kernel in the shell; so that 1 had
near sixty pounds of very good powder in the center of the
cask; this was every agreeable discovery to me at that
time; so I carried all away thither, never keeping above
two or three pounds of owder with me in m castle, for
fear of a surprise of any ind; I also carried thither all the
lead I had left for bullets.

I found expiring, died in the mouth of the cave the next
day after I made this discovery; and I found it much easier
to dig a great hole there, and throwhim in and cover him
with earth than to drag him out; so I interred him

the two old ones I brought with me were gone, and after
some time continually driving them from me, and letting
them have no provision with me, they all ran wild into the
woods, except two or three favorites, which I kept tame,
and whose young, when they had any, 1 always drowned;

dread of the savages. But it was otherwise directed; and
it may not be amiss for all people who shall meet with my
story to make this just observation from it, viz. ,' How fre-

the weather by this time being perfectly clear, could

found when I was out in my boat; and which rocks, as
they checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind
of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my re-

ever I had been in in all my life. Thus, what is one man’s

into the great ocean, where there was nothing but misery

that the Providence of 0d casts us into any condition of
lite so low, or any misery so great, but we may see some-
thing or other to be thankful tor, and may see others in
worse circumstances than our own. Such certainly was
the case of these men, of whom I could not so much as see
room to suppose any of them were saved; nothing could
make it rational so much as to wish or expect that they did
not all perish there, except the possibility only of their be-
ing taken up by another ship in company; and this was
but mere possibility indeed, for I saw not the least sign or
appearance of any such thing. I can not explain, by any
possible energy of words, what a strange longing or han-
ering of desires I felt in my soul upon this sight, break-

THERE are some secret moving s rings in tho affections
which, when they are set a-going y some object in view,
or, though not in view, yet rendered present to the mind
by the power of imagination, that motion carries out the
soul, by its impetuosity, to such violent, eager embracings
of the object that the absence of it is insupportable. Such
were these earnest wishings (that but one man had been

reason and manner of them; all I can say to them is to
describe the fact, which was even surprising to me, when
I found it, though I knew not from whence it proceeded;
it was doubtless the effect of ardent wishes, and of strong
ideas formed in my mind, realizing the comfort which the
conversation of one of my teller/“Christians would have

had nothing in his pockets but two pieces-of-eight and a

' did not altogether press me so much as the possibility that
there-might be yet some living creature on board, whose
life I might not only save, but might, by saving that life,
comfort my own to the last degree. And this thought
clung so to my heart that I could not be quiet night or day,
but 'I must venture out in my boat on board this wreck;
and committing the rest to God’s Providence, I thought
the impression was so strong upon my mind that it could
not “be resisted, that it must come from some invisible
direction, and that I' should be wanting to myself if 1 did
not go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to
my castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took a
quantity .of bread, a great pot of fresh water, a compass to
steer by, a bottle of rum (for 1 had still a great deal of
that left), and a basket of raisins; and thus loading myself
with everything necessary, I went down to my boat, got

was a great bag of rice, the umbrella to set up over my
head for a shade, another large pot of fresh water, and
about two dozen of my small leaves, or barley~cak_es, more
than before, with a bottle of goat’s milk and a cheese; all
which, with great labor and sweat, 1 carried to my boat,
and praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out; and
rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore, came at last
to the utmost point of the island on the north-east side.
And now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either to
venture or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents
which ran constantly on both sides of the island at a dis-
tance, and which were very terrible to me, from the re-
membrance of the hazard I had been in before, and. my
heartbegan to fail me; for I foresaw that if 1 was driven
into either of these currents 1 should be carried a great
way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach, or sight of
the island again; and that, then, as my boat was but
small, if any little gale of wind should rise, 1 should be
inevitably lost.
Thpse thoughts so oppressed my mind that I began to
give oyer my enterprise; and having hauled my boat into
a little creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat me down
upon a rising bit of ground, very pensive and anxious, be-
tween fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was

south side had done before, so as to take from me all gov-

addle, I went at a great rate directly for the wreck, and
1n less than two hours I came up to it. It was a dismal
sight to look at; the ship, which, by its building, was
Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two rocks; all the
stern and quarter of her were beaten to pieces with the sea;
and as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks, had run
on with great violence, her mainmast and foremast were
brought by the board, that is to say, broken short 03; but
her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared

when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so
high, and so continually over her, that the men were not

water. Besides the dog,‘there was nothing left in the ship
that had life; nor any goods, that I could see, but what

liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew not, which lay
lower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out,
1 could see; but they were too big to meddle with. I saw
several chests, which I believed belonged to some of the
seamen; and I got two of them into the boat, without ex-
amining what was in them. Had the stern of the ship been

two chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a great

course she steered, she must have been bound from
Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of
America, beyond'the Brazils, to the Havanna, in the Gulf
of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt,
a great treasure in her, but of nouse, at that time, to any-
body; and what became of her crew, I then knew not.
I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor,
of about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with

little brass kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a

evening, about an hour within night, 1 reached the island
again, weary and fatigued to the last degree. I reposed
that night in the boat; and in the morning I resolved to
harbor what I had got in my new cave, and not carry it
home to my castle. After refreshing myself, 1 got all my
»
cargo on shore, and began to examine the particulars.
The cask of liquor 1 found to be a kind of rum, but not
such as we had at the Brazils, and, in a word, not at all
good; but when I came to open the chests, I found several
things of great use to me; for example, 1 found in one a

found two pots of very good succades or sweetnieats, so
fastened also on the top, that the salt-water had not hurt
them; and two more of the same, which the water had
spoiled. I found some very good shirts, which Were very
welcome to me; and about a dozen and a half of white
linen handkerehiefs and colored neck-cloths; the former
were also very welcome, being exceeding refreshing to wipe
my face in a hot defy. Besides this, when 1 came to the
till in the chest, 1 found there three great bags of pieces-
of-eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in all;
‘and in one of them, wrapped up in a paper, six doubloons
of gold and some small bars or wedges of gold; I suppose
they might all weigh near a pound. In the other chests
were some clothes, but of little value; but, by the circum-
stances, it must have belonged to the gunner’s mate;

whole, 1 got very little by this voyage that was of any use

'have given it all for three or four pair 0 English shoes and

none on my feet for many years. I had indeed got two

poorer man than the other, which seemed to belong to
some officer. Well, however, I lagged this money home
to my cave, and laid it up, as 1 had done that before which
I brought from our own ship; but it was a great pity, as I
said, that the other part of this ship had not come to my _

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured
them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her
along the shore, to her old harbor, where I laid her up,
and made the best of my way to my old habitation, where
I found everything safe and quiet. I began now to repose
myself, live after my old fashion, and take care of my
family affairs; and, for awhile, I lived easy enough, only

walked about in the greatest security, and with all possible
tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing but the brow of a
bill, a great tree, or the casual approach of night, had
been between me and the worst kind of destruction, viz.,
that of falling into the hands of cannibals and savages,
who would have seized on me with the same view as I
would on a goat or a turtle, and have thought it no more
a crime to kill and devour me than I did a pigeon or cur~
low. I would unjustly slander myself, if I should say I-
was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose
singular protection I acknowledged, with great humility,
all these unknown deliverances were due, and without
which I must inevitably have fallen into their merciless
hands.
When these thoughts were over, my head was for some
time taken up in considering the nature of these wretched
creatures, I mean the savages, and how it came to ass in
the world, that the wise Governoipf all things shcu d give
up any of His creatures to such inhumanity, nay, to some:
thing so much below even brutality itself, as to devour its .
own kind; but as this ended in some (at that time) fruit-
less speculations, it occurred to me to inquire what part of
the world these wretches lived in; how far off the coast was
from whence they came; what they ventured over so far
from home for; what kind of boats they had; and why I.
might not order myself and my business so, that I might
be as able to go over thither as they were to come to me. (
I never so much as troubled myself to consider what 1
should do with myself when I went thither, what would,
become of me, if I fell into the hands of the savages; or
how I should escape from them, if they attacked me: no,\
nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach the;
coast, and not be attacked by some or other of them, with-I
out any possibility of delivering myself; and if I should not
fall into their hands, what I should do for provision. or:
whither I should bend my course: none of these thoughts;
I say, so much as came in my way; but my mind was
wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in my boat
to the main land. I looked upon my present condition as
the most miserable that could possibly be; that I was not
able to throw myself into anything, but death, that could
be called worse; and if I reached the shore of the main, I
mi ht perhaps meet with relief, or 1 might coast alon , as
I did on the African shore, till I came to some iuha ited
176 nosnvsox CBUSOI.
perhaps,'I might fall in with some Christian ship that
might take me in; and if the worst came to the worst, 1
could but die, which would put an end to all these miseries
at once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed
mind, an impatient tem er, made desperate, as it were, by
the long continuance o my troubles, and the disap oint-
ments I had met in the wreck I had been on board of: and
where I had been so near obtaining what 1 so earnestly
longed for, viz., somebody to speak to, and to learn some
knowledge from them of the place where I was, and. of the
robable means of my deliverance. I was agitated wholly
y these thoughts: all my calm of mind, in my resignation
to Providence, and waiting the issue of the dispositions of
Heaven, seemed to be suspended; and I had, as it were. no
power to turn my thoughts to anything but to the project
of a voyage to t 0 main. which came upon me wit sash

be resisted. »
When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or
more, with such violence that it set my very blood into a
ferment, and my pulse beats as if I had been in a fever,
merely with the extraordinary fervor of my mind about
it, nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhallsted with
the very thought of it, threw me into a sound sleep. _One
would have thought I should have dreamed of it, but I did

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion: that my

to get a savage into my possession; and, if possible, it
should be one of their prisoners whom they had condemned
to be eaten, and should bring hither to kill. But these

SECTION XXII.
Robinson Rescues one of Their Captives from the Savages, Whom he
names Friday, and makes his Servant.
ABOUT a year and a half after 1 entertained these notions
(and by long musing had, as it were, resolved them all into
nothing, for want of an occasion to put them into execu-
tion), I was surprised, one morning early, with seeing no

and out of my sight. The number of them broke all my
measures; for seeing so many, and knowing that they
always came four or six, or sometimes more, in a boat, I
could not tell What to think of it, or how to take my meas-
ures, to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; so lay
still in my castle, perplexed and discom orted: however, I
put myself into all the same postures for an attack that I
had formerly provided, and was just ready for action, it
anything had presented. Having waited a good while, list-
ening to hear if they made any noise, at length, being very
impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and
clambered up to the top of the hill, by my two stages, as
usual; standing so, however, that my head did not appear
above the hill, so that they could not perceive me by any
means. Here 1 observed, by the help of my perspective
glass, that they were no less than thirty in number; that

they were all dancing, in I know notv how many barbarous

‘While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, ‘by my
perspective, two miserable wretehes dragged from the
cats, where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now
brought out for the slaughter. 1 perceived one of them
immediately fall, beirgg knocked down, I suppose, with a
club or wooden sword, for that was their way, and two or
three others were at_wogkwimmediately, cutting him open

for their cookery, while the other victim was left standing
by himself,.till they should be ready ‘for him. In that very
moment, this poor wretch seeing himself a little at liberty,
and unbound, nature inspired him with hopes of life, and
he started away from them, and ran with incredible swift-
ness along the sands, directly toward me, I‘ mean toward
that part of the coast where my habitation was. 1 was
dreadfully frightened, I must acknowledge, when I per-
ceived him run my way, and especially when, as I thought,
I saw him pursued by the whole body: and now 1 expected
that art of my dream was coming to pass, and that he
would) certainly take shelter in my grove; but 1 could not
depend, by any means, upon my dream for the rest of it,
viz., that the other savages would not pursue him thither,
180 IOBINSON causes.
I irits began to recover, when I found t at there was not
above three men that followed him; and still more was 1
encouraged when I found that he outstripped them exceed-
ingly in running, and gained ground of them, so that if he
could but hold it for half an hour, I saw easily he would
fairly get away from them all.
There was between them and my castle the creek, which

he must necessarily swim over, or the poor Wretch would
be taken there: but when the savage escaping came
thither, he made nothing of it, though the tide was then
up; but plunging in, swam through in about thirty strokes,
or thereabouts, landed, and ran on with exceeding strength
and swiftness.‘ When the three persons came to the creek,
I found that two of them could swim, but the third could
not, and that, standing on the other side, he looked at the
others, but went no further, and soon after went softly
back again; which, as it happened, was very well for him
in the end. I observed, that the two who swam were yet
more than twice as long swimming over the creek as the

upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was
the time to get me a servant, and perhaps a companion or
instant, and that I was called plainly by Providence to
love this poor creature’s life. I immediately ran down the
ladders wrth all possible expedition, fetched my two guns,
k My were both at_ngth_g.‘foqt of the ladders, as I observed
above, and getting up again, with the same haste, to the
top of the hill, I crossed toward the sea, and having a very

little way; then stopped again, and then a little further,
and stopped again; and I could then perceive that he stood
trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just
been to be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned to
him again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of en-
couragement that 1 could think of; and he came nearer
and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in
token of acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at
him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come
still nearer: at length he Came close to me; and then he
knelt down again, kissed the ground, and laid his head
upon the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my foot
upon his head: this, it seems, was in token of swearing to
be my slave forever. 1 took him up, and made much of
him, and encouraged him all I could. But there was more
work to do yet; for I perceived the savage whom I knocked
down was not killed but stunned with the blow, and began

down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the
ground, and 1 perceived that my savage began to be afraid;
but when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the
man, as if I would shoot him: upon this my savage, for so
I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my
sword which hung naked in a belt by my side, which I did.
He no sooner had it, but he ran to his enemy, and, at one
blow, cut off his head so cleverly, no executioner in Ger- _
many could have done it sooner or better; which I thought
very strange for one who, I had reason to believe, never
saw a sword in his life before, except their own wooden
swords: however, it seems, as I learned afterward, they
made their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood
Ihas so hard, that they will cut off heads even with them, ay
and arms, and that at one blow too. When he had done
this, he came ladghing to me, in sign of triumph, and
brought me the sword again, and with abundance of gest-
ures, which I did not understand, laid it down, with the
head of the savage that he had killed, just before me. But
that which astonished him most was to know how I killed
the other Indian so far 05: so pointing to him, he made
signs to me to let him go to him; so 1 bade him go, as well
as I could. When he came to him, he stood like one

made, which, it seems, was just in his breast where it had
made a hole, and novgreat quantity of blood had followed,
but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead. He took
up his bow and arrows, and came back; so 1 turned to go
away, and beckoned him to follow me, making signs to
him that more might come after them. Upon this, he
made signs to me that he should bury them with sand,
that they might not be seen by the rest, if they followed;
and so [made signs to him again to do so. He fell to
work; and, in an instant, he had scraped a hole in the

then dragged him into it, and covered him; and did so by
the other also: I believe he had buried them both in a
quarter of an hour. Then calling him away, I carried
him, not to my castle, but quite away, to my cave, on the
further part of the land : so I did not let my dream come
to pass in that part, viz., that he came into my grove for
shelter. Here 1 gave him bread and a bunch of raisins
to eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was in-
deed in great distress for, by his running; and having re-
freshed him, I made signs for him to go and lie down to
deep, showing him a place where I had laid some rice
straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon
myself sometimes; so the poor creature lay down, and went
to sleep.
He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made,
with straight, strong limbs, not too large, tall, and well-
shaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age.

face; and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of a
European in his countenance too, especially when he
smiled. His hair was long and black, not curled like
wool; his forehead very high and large; and a great vivac-
aty and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The color of his
skin was not quite black, but very tawny; and yet not an
ugly yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Virgin-
lans, and other natives of America are, but of a bright kind
of a dun olive color, that had in it something very agree-

After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an .
hour he awoke again, and came out of the cave to me, for
I had been milking my goats, which 1 had in the inclosure
just by: when he espied me, he came running to me, lay-
ing himself down again upon the ground, with all the pos-

which he quickly complied with, and made signs that it
was very good for him. I kept there with him all that

them. At this I appeared very angry, expressed my ab-
horrence of it, made as it I would vomit at the thoughts of
it, and beckoned with my hand to him to come away, which
he did immediately, with great submission. 1 then led him
up to the top of the hill, to see if his enemies were gone;
and pulling out my lass, I looked, and saw- plainly the
place where they had een, but no appearance of them or,
their canoes: so that it was plain that they were one, and
had left their two comrades behind them, wit out any
search after them. v

to get some fuller intelligence of them. When 1 came to

to feast upon; that three of them were eaten up, and that
he, pointing to himself, was the fourth; that there had
been a great battle between them and their next king,
whose subjects, it seems, he had been one of, and that they
had taken a great number of prisoners; all which were car-

as my skill would allow (for l was now grown a tolerable

was clothed for the present, tolerably well, and was mighty

might do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I
made a little tent for him in the vacant place between my

eVer: the many testimonies he gave me of this put it out

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that
with wonder, that however it had pleased God, in His
providence, and in the government of the works of His
ands, to take from so great a part of the world of His
creatures the best uses to which their faculties and the
powers of their souls are adapted, yet that He has be-

how mean a use we make of all these, even though we have
these powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction,
the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of His word added
to our understanding; and why it has pleased God to hide
the like saving knowledge from so many millions of souls,
who, if I might judge by this poor savage, would make a
much better use of it than we did. From hence, I some-
times was led too far, to invade the sovereignty of Provi-
dence, and as it were arraign the justice of so arbitrary a
disposition of things, that should hide that light from
some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty
from both; but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts

were all sentenced to absence from himself, it was on ac-

says, was a law to themselves, and by such rules as their
consciences would acknowledge to be just, though the
foundation was not discovered to us; and, secondly, That

everything that was proper to make him useful, handy, and
helpful; but especially to make 'him speak, and understand
me when I spoke: and he was the aptest scholar that ever
was; and particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent,
and so pleased when he could but understand me, or make
me understand him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk

AFTER I had been two or three days returned to my

his horrid way of feeding, and from the relish of a canni-
bal’s stomach, I ought to let him taste other flesh; so I
took him out with me one morning to the woods. 1 went,
indeed, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock, and
bring it home and dress it; but as I was going, I saw a sh:-
goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids sitting
y her. 1 catched hold of Friday: Hold, said I; stand
still; and made signs to him not to stir: immediately I
presented my piece, shot, and killed one of the kids. The
poor creature, who had, at a distance, indeed, seen me kill
the savage, his enemy, but did not know, nor could imag-
ine, how it was done, was sensibly surprised, trembled and
shock, and looked so amazed, that I thought he would have
sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot at, or perceive
I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat, to feel whether
he was not wounded, and, as I found presently, thou ht I
was resolved to kill him: for he came and knelt own
to me, and embracing my knees, said a great many things
I did not understand; but 1 could easily see the meaning
was, to pray me not to kill him. ,7 M-
I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him
no harm; and taking him 11 by the hand, lau hed at him,
and pointing to the kid whic 1 had killed, bec oned to him
to run and fetch it, which he did; and while he was won-
dering and looking to see how the creature was killed, I
loaded my gun again. By and by, I saw a great fowl, like
a hawk, sitting upon a tree, within shot; so, to let Friday
understand a little what 1 would do, I called him to me
again, pointed at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot,
though I thought it had been a hawk; I say, ointing to
the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground) under the
parrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made him
understand that I would shoot and kill that bird: accord-

the parrot fall. He stood like one frightened again, not-
withstanding all I had said to him; and I found he was the
more amazed, because he did not see me put anything into
the gun, but thought that there must be some wonderful
fund of death and destruction in that thing, able to kill
man, beast or bird, or anything near or far OE; and the
astonishment this created in him was such, as could not
wear off for a long time; and I believe, if I would have let
him, he would have worshiped me and my gun. As for
the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it for several
days after; but he would speak to it, and talk to it, as it
it had answered him, when he was by himself; which, as I
afterward learned of him, was to desire it not to kill him.
Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, 1

place where she fell: however, he ound her, took her up,
and brought her to me; and as I had rceived his igno-
rance about the gun before, I took this vantage to charge
the gun again, and not to let him see me do it, that I
might be ready for any other mark that might present;
but nothing more oifered at that time: so I brought home
the kid, and the same evening 1 took the skin off, and out

pose, l boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some
very good broth. After I had begun to eat some, 1 gave
some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it
very well: but that which was strangest to him, was to see
me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the salt
was not good to eat; and putting a tittle into his mouth,
he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it,
washing his mouth with fresh water after it: on the other
hand, I took some meat into my mouth without salt, and
I pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast as
he had done at the salt; but it would not do; he would never
care for salt with his meat or in his broth; at least, not for
a great while, and then but very little.
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was
resolved to feast him the next day with roasting a piece of

glad to hear.
The next day 1 set him to work to beating some corn
out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as Iobserved
before; and he soon understood how to do it as well as I,
especially after he had I seen what the meaning of it was,
and that it was to make bread of it: for after that I let
him see me make my bread, and bake it too; and in a lit-
tle time Friday was able to do all the work for me, as well
as I could do it myself.
I began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed
instead of one, 1 must provide more ground for my harvest,
and plant a larger quantity of corn than I used to do: s0 1
marked out a larger piece of land, and began the fence in
the same manner as before, in which Friday worked not
only very willin ly and very hard, but did it very cheer-
fully: and 1 tol him what it was for; that it was for corn
to make more bread, because he was now with me, and
that 1 might have enough for him and myself too. He ap-
peared very sensible of that art, and let me know that he
thought I had much more abor upon me on his account
than I had for myself; and that he would work the harder
for me, if 1 would tell him what to do.
This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this
place. Friday began to ta k pretty well, and understand
the names of almost everything I had occasion to call for,
and of every place I had to send him to, and talked a great
deal to me; so that, in short, I began now to have some,
use for my tongue again, which, indeed, I had ver little
occasion for before, that is to say, about speech. esides '
the pleasure of talking to him, 1 had a singular satisfaction
in the fellow himself: his simple, unfeigned honesty ap-
peared to me more and more every day, and I began really
to love the creature; and, on his side, I believe he loved
in? more than it was possible for him ever to love anything
e ore.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclin-
ation for his own country again; and having taught him
English so well that he could answer me almost any ques‘

tion, I asked him whether the nation that he belonged to
never conquered in battle? At which he smiled, and said,

be taken prisoner then, Friday?
Friday: My nation beat much, for all that.
Master: How beat? If your nation beat them, how
came on to be taken?
Fri ay: They more many than my nation in the place
where me was; they take one, two, three, and me; my na-
tion overheat them in the yonder place, where me no was;
there my nation take one, two, great thousand.
Master: But why did not your side recover you from the
hands of your enemies, then.
Friday: They run one, two, three, and me, and make go
in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that time.
Master: Well, Friday, and what does ,your nation do
with the men they take? Do they carry them away and
eat them, as these did?
Friday: Yes, my nation eat mans too; eat all up.
Master: vWhere do they carry them?
Friday: Go to other place, where they think.
Master: Do they come hither? .
1Friday: Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else
p ace.
Master: Have you been here with them?
Friday: Yes, I have been here; (points to the north-west
side of the island, which, it seems, was their side).
By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly
been among the savages who used to come on shore on the
further part of the island, on the same man-eating occa—
sions he was now brought for: and some time after, when _
v I took the courage to carry him to that side, being the same
I formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and
told me he was there once when they eat up twenty men,
two women, and one child: he could not tell twenty in
English, but he numbered them, by laying so many stones
in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over.
I have told this passage, because it introduces what fol-
lows, that after I had this discourse with him, I asked him
how far it was 1mm 1 island to the shore, and whether


the canoes were not often lost. He told me there was no
danger, no canoes ever lost; but that, after a little way out
to sea, there was a current and wind, always one way in
the morning, the other in the afternoon. This 1 under-
stood to be no more than the sets of the tide, as going out
or coming in; but I afterward understood it was occa-
192 nonmson canson.
Oroonoko, in the mouth or gulf of which river, as I found
afterward, our island lay; and that this land which I per-
ceived to the west and north- west was the great island Trin-
idad, on the north point of the mouth of the river. I asked
Friday a thousand questions about the country, the inhab-
itants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were near: he
told me all he knew, with the greatest openness imagin-
able. I asked him the names of the several nations of his
sort of people, but could get no other name than Caribs:
from whence 1 easily understood, that these were the Car-
ibbees, which our maps place on the part of America which
reaches from the mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guinea,
and onward to St. Martha. \ He told me that up a great
way beyond the moon, that was, beyond the setting of the
moon, which must be west from their country, there dwelt
white bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great whisp
kers, which I mentioned before; and that they had killed
much mans, that was his word: by all which I understood,
he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had
been spread over the whole country, and were remembered
by all the nations, from father to son.
I inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this
island and get among those white men: he told me, Yes,
yes, you may go in two canoe. I could not understand
what he meant, or make him describe to me what he meant
192 nonmson canson.
meant it must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes.
This part of Friday’s discourse began to relish with me very
well; and from this time 1 entertained some hopes that,
192 nonmson canson.
my escape from this place, and that this poor savage might
be a means to help me. ,
During the long time that Friday had now been with me,
and that he began to speak to me, and understand me, I
was not wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge
in his mind: particularly I asked him, one time, who made
0
him! The poor creature did not understand me at all, but
thought I had asked him who was his father; but I took it
up by another handles, and asked him who made the sea,
the ground we walked on, and the hills and woods? He
told me, it was one old Benamuckee, that lived beyond all;
he could describe nothing of this great person, but that he
was very old, much older, he said, than the sea or the land,
than the moon or the stars. I asked him then, if this old
person had made all things, why did not all things worship
him? He looked very grave, and with a perfect look of
innocence said, All things say oh to him. I asked him if
the people who die in his country went away anywhere?
He said, Yes; they all went to Benamuckee: then I asked
grim whether these they eat up went thither too? He said,
. es.
From these things I began to instruct him in the knowl-
edge of the true God: I told him that the great Maker of
all things lived up there, pointing up toward heaven; that
He governed the world by the same power and providence
by which He made it; that He was omnipotent, and could
do everything for us, give everything to us, take every-
thing from us; and thus, by degrees, 1 opened his eyes.
He listened with great attention, and received with pleasure
the notion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of
the manner of making our prayers to God, and His being
able to hear us, even in heaven. He told me one day, that
if our God could hear us up beyond the sun, He must needs
be a greater God than their Benamuckce, who lived but a
little way off, and yet could not hear till they went up to
the great mountains where he dwelt to speak to him. I
asked him if ever he went thither to speak to him? He
said, No; they never went that were young men: none
went thither but the old men, whom he called their
Oowokakee; that is, as 1 made him explain it to me, their
religious, or clergy; and that they went to say oh (so he
' called saying prayers), and then came back, and told them
what Benamuckee said. By this I observed that there is
priestcraft even among the most blinded, ignorant pagans
1n the world; and the policy of making a secret of religion,
in order to preserve the veneration of the people to the
clergy, is not only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps
amon all reli ions in the world, even among the most
brutii and bar aroas savages.
I endeavored to clear up this fraud to my man Friday;
and told him, that the pretense of their old men going up
to the mountains to say oh to their god Benarnuckee was a
cheat; and their bringing word from thence what he said
was much more so; that if they met with any answer, or
spoke With any one there, it must be with an evil spirit;
and then I entered into a long discourse with him about
the devil, the original of him, his rebellion against God,
his enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting himself up
in the dark parts of the world to be worshiped instead of
God, and as God, and the many stratagems he made use of
$0 delude mankind to their ruin; how he had a secret ac~
case to our passions and to our affections, and to adapt his
snares to our inclinations, so as to cause us even to be our
own tempters, and run upon our destruction by our own
choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his
mind about the devil, as it was about the being of a God:
nature assisted all my ar uments to evidence to him even
the necessity of a great %‘irst Cause and overruling, gov-
erning Power, a secret, directing Providence, and of the
equity and justice of paying homage to Him that made us,
and the like; but there appeared nothing of this kind in
the notion of an evil spirit; of his origin, his being, his
nature, and, above all, of his inclination to do evil, and to
draw us in to do so too: and the poor creature puzzled me
once in such a manner, by a question merely natural and
innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I had
been talking a rest deal to him of the power of God, His
omnipotence, is aversion to sin, His being a consuming
194 nonmson causes.
He could destroy us an all the world in a moment; and
he listened with great seriousness to me all the while. After
this, I had been telling him how the devil was God’s enemy
in the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill to
defeat the good designs of Providence, and to ruin the
kin dom 01 Christ in the world, and the like. Well, says
Fri ay, but you say God is so strong, so rest; is He not -
much strong, much might as the devil?— es, yes, says 1.
Friday, God is stronger than the devil: God is above the
devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him down
under our feet, and enable us to resist his temptations, and
194 nonmson causes.
O
stronger, much might as the devil, why God no kill the
devil, so make him no more do wicked? I was strangely
surprised at this question; and, after all, though I was

hear him, and asked him what he said; but he was too
earnest for an answer to forget his question, so that he re-

time I had recovered myself a little, and 1 said, God will
at last punish him severely; he is reserved for the judg-

the light of the knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling
him to himself, and would guide me to speak so to him
from the word of God, as his conscience might be convinced,
his eyes Opened, and his soul saved. When he came again
to me, I entered into a long discourse with him upon the
subject of the redemption of man by the Saviour of the
world, and of the doctrine of the ospel preached from
heaven, viz., of repentance toward rod, and faith in our
blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him, as well as 1
could, why our blessed Redeemer took not on Him the
nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham; and how, for
that reason, the fallen angels had no share in the redemp-
tion; that He came only to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel, and the like.

I continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of

between Friday and me was such as made the three years

happy, 11 any such thing as complete happiness can be

myself, in reading the Scriptures, to let him know, as well
as I could, the meaning of what 1 read; and he again, by
his serious inquiries and questionings, made me, as I said before, a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge

work of sincere repentance for my sins, and laying hold of

we had, blessed be God, comfortable views of the S irit of
God teaching and instructing us by HIS Word, lea ing us
into all truth, and making us both willing and obedient to
the instructions of His Word. And 1 can not see the least
use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points of
religion, which have made such confusions in the world,
would have been to us, if we could have obtained it. But
I must go on with the historical part of things, and take

AFTER Friday and I became more intimately acquainted,
and that he could understand almost all I said to him, and
198 EOBINSON causes.
ac uainted him with my own history, or at least so much
of it as related to mycoming to this place; how I had lived
here, and how long; I let him into the mystery, for such
it was to him, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him
how to shoot. I gave him a knife, which he was wonder-
fully delighted with, and I made him a belt with a frog
han ing to it, such as in England we wear hangers in; and
in t e frog, instead of a hanger, 1 gave him a hatchet,
which was not only as good a weapon, in some cases, but
much more useful upon other occasions.
I described to him the country of Europe, particularly
England, which I came from; how we lived, how we wor-
shiped God, how we behaved to one another, and how we
traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave him an
account of the wreck which I had been on board of, and
showed him, as near as I could, the place where she lay;
but she was all beaten in pieces before, and gone. I
# showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when I
escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole strength
then; but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon see-
ing this boat, Friday stood musing a great while, and said
nothing. I asked him what it was he studied upon? At
last, says he, Me see such boat like come to place at my
nation. 1 did not understand him a good while; but at
last when I had examined, further into it, I understood by
him, that a boat, such as that had been, came on shore
upon the country where he lived; that is, as he explained
it, was driven thither by stress of weather. I resently
imagined that some European ship must have con east
away upon their coast, and the boat might get loose, and
drive ashore; but was so dull that I never once thought of
men making their Qreseape from a wreck thither, much less
in

whence they might come; so I only inquired after a de-
scri tion of the boat.
riday described the boat to me well enough; but
brought me better to understand him when he added, with
some warmth, We save the white mans from drown. Then
1 presently asked him if there were any white mans, as he
called them, in the boat. Yes, he said; the boat full of
white mans. I asked him how many. He told me upon

them. He told me, They live, they dwell at my nation.
This put new thoughts into my head, for I presently im-
agined that these might be the men belonging to the ship
that was cast away in the sight of my island, as I now called
it; and who, after the ship was struck on the rock, and
they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their
boat, and were landed upon that Wild shore among the sav-
ages. Upon this, 1 inquired of him more critically what
was become of them; he assured me they lived still there;
that they had been there about four years; that the sav-
ages let them alone, and gave them victuals to liv’e on. I
asked him how it came to pass they did not kili them, and
eat them? He said, N 0, they make brother with them;
that is, as I understood him, a truce; and .then he added,

It was after this some considerable time that, being
upon the to of the hill, at the east side of the island, from
whence, as have said, I had, in a clear day, discovered.

and, in a kind of surprise, falls a jum ing and dancing,
and calls out to me, for 1 was at some istance from him.
I asked him what was the matter. Oh, joy, as s he! oh,
glad! there see my country, there my nation! Iobserved
an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his face, and
his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a strange
eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his own country
again. This observation of mine put a great many thoughts

man Friday as I was before; and I made no doubt but that
if Friday could get back to his own nation a sin, he would
not only forget all his religion, but all his ob igation to me,
and would be forward enough to give his countrymen an
account of me, and come back perhaps with a hundred or
two of them, and make a feast upon me, at which he
might be as merry as he used to be With those of his
enemies, when they were taken in war. But I Wronged
the poor honest creature very much, for which I was very
sorry afterward. However, as my jealousy increased, and
held me some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and
not so familiar and kind to him as before; in which I was
certainly in the wrong too; the honest, grateful creature
having no thought about it, but what consisted with the
best rinciples, both as a religious Christian, and as a
grate ul friend, as appeared afterward to my full satisfac-
tion.
While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was
every day pumping him, to see if he would discover any of
the new thoughts which I suspected were in him; but I
found everything he said was so honest and so innocent,
300 nonmsou causes.
spite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his
own again; nor did he, in the least, perceive that I was
uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit.
One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather be-
ing hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I
called to him and said, Friday, do not you wish yourself in
your own country, your own nation? Yes, he said, I be
much oh, glady, to be at my own nation. What would
you do there? said 1; would you turn wild again, eat men’s

again. Why, then, said I to him, they will kill you. He
looked grave at that, and then said, No, no; they no kill
me, they willing love learn. He meant by this they would
be willing to learn. He added, they learned much of the
bearded mans that came in the boat. Then I asked him it
he would go back to them. He smiled at that, and told
me that he could not swim so far. I told him I would
make a canoe for him. He told me he would go, if I
Would go with him. 1 go! says I; why, they will eat me,
if I come there. No, no, says he; me make they no eat

tell them how 1 had killed his enemies and saved his life,
and so he would make them love me. Then he told me,
as well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen white
men, or bearded men, as he called them, who came on
shore there in distress.
From this time I confess I had a mind to venture over,
and see if I could possibly join with those bearded men,
who, 1 made no doubt, were Spaniards and Portuguese;

to escape from thence, being upon the continent, and a
good company together, better than I could from an island
forty miles off the shore, and alone, without help. So,
after some days, 1 took Friday to work again, by way of
discourse, and told him 1 would give him a boat to go back
to his own nation; and accordingly I carried him to my
frigate, which lay on the other side of the island, and hay-
ing cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk in water)
I brought it out, showed it him, and we both went into it.
I found he was a most dexterous fellow at'managing it,
and would make it go almost as swift again as I could.
So when he was in I said to him, Well, now, Friday, shall
we go to your nation? He looked very dull at my saying
' so; which, it seems, was because he thought the boat too
small to go so far; I then told him 1 had a bigger; so the

said that Was big enough; but then, as I had taken no cars
of it, and it had lain two or three-and-twenty years there,
the sun had split and dried it, that it was in a manner rot-

would carry much enough vittle, drink, bread; that was

him we would go and make one as big as that, and he
should go home in it. He answered not one word, but
looked very grave and sad. I asked him what was the
matter with him. He asked me again, Wh you angry
mad with Friday? What me done? I asked im what he
meant. I told him I was not angry with him at all. No
angry? says he, lepeating the words several times. Why
send Friday home away to my nation? Why, says I, Fri-
day, did not you say you wished you were there? Yes, yeah
says he, wish be both there; no wish Friday there, no mas
ter there. In a word, he would not think of going there
without me. I go there, Friday! says I; what shall I do
there? He returned very quick upon me at this: You do
great deal much good, says be, you teach wild mans be
good, sober, tame mans; you tell them know God, pray
0d, and live new life. Alas! Friday, says I, then kiiowest . ‘
not what thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man. myself.
Yes, yes, says he, you teaches me good, you teaches them
good. No, no, Friday, says I, you shall go without me;
. leave me here to live by myself, as I did before. He
looked confused again at that word; and running to one of
the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily,
and gives it to me. What must I do with this? says I to
him. You take "l Friday, says he. What must I kill
you for? said 1 again. He returns very quick: What you
send Friday away for? Take kill Friday, no send Friday
away. i This he spoke so earnestly, that 1 saw tears stand
in his eyes; in a word, 1 so plainly discovered the utmost

I told him then, and often after, that I would never send
him away from me, if he was Willing to stay with me.
Upon the whole, as I found, by all his discourse, a set-

from me, so I found all the foundation of his desire to go

which, as I had no notion of myself, so I had not the
‘ least thought, or intention, or desire of undertaking it.
But still 1 found a strong inclination to my attempting an

the discourse, viz., that there were seventeen bearded men

large vessels; but the main thing I looked at was, to get
one so near the water that we might launch it when it was

Friday itched upon a tree, for I found he knew much

I tell, to this day, what wood to call the tree we cut down,

except that it was very like the tree we call fustic, or be-
tween that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the
same color and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow
or cavity of this tree out, to make it for a boat, but 1
showed him how to cut it with tools, which, after 1 had
showeddzim how to use, he did very handily; and in about

some; especially when, with our axes, which I showed him
how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true
shape of a boat. After this, however, it cost us near a
fortnight’s time to get her along, as it were, inch by inch,
upon great rollers, into the water; but when she was in
she would have carried twenty men with great case.
When she was in the water,'and though she was so big,
it amazed me to see with what dexterity, and how swift my
man Friday would manage her, turn her, and paddle her
along. So I asked him if he would, and if we might vent-
ure over in her. Yes, he said; we venture over in her
very well, though great blow wind. However, 1 had a
further design, that he knew nothing of, and that-was to

pitched upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I found
near the place, and which there were great lenty of in the
island; and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave
him directions how to shape and order it. But as to the
sail, that was my particular care. ‘I knew I had 01d sails,
or rather pieces of old sails, enough; but as I had had them
now six-and-twenty years by me, and had not been very
careful to preserve them, not im ining that I should ever
have this kind of use for them, did not doubt but they
were all rotten, and, indeed, most of them were so. How-
ever, I found two pieces, which ap ared pretty good, and
with these I went to work; and wit a great deal of pains,
and awkward stitching, you may be sure, for want of
needles, I at length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like
what we call in England a shoulder-ofamutton sail, to go
with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top,
such as usually our ship’s long-boats sail with, and such as
1 best knew how to manage, as it was such a one I had to

steer with. I was but a bungling shipwright, yet, as I
knew the usefulness, and even necessity of such a thing, I
applied myself with so much pains to do it, that at last I
brought it to pass; though, considering the many dull con-
trivances 1 had for it that failed, I think it cost me almost
as much labor as making the boat.
After all this was done, I had my man Frida to teach
as to what belonged to the navigation of my host; for,
though he knew very well how to paddle a canoe, he knew
nothing what belonged to a sail and a rudder, and was the
most amazed when he saw me work the boat to and again

this way, or that way, as the course we sailed changed; 1
say, when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and
amazed. However, with a little use, I made all these
things familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, ex-
cept that, as to the compass 1 could make him understand
very little of that. On the other hand, as there was very
little cloudy weather, .and seldom or never any fogs in
those parts, there was the less occasion for a compass, see-
ing the stars were always to be seen by night, and the
shore by day, except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody
cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea. E
I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of m
captivity in this place; though the three last years thatI
had this creature with me ought rather to be left out of
the account, my habitation being quite of another kind
than in all the rest of the time. I kept the anniversary of

and the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily
delivered; for I had an invincible impression upon my

with my husbandry; digging, planting, and fencing, as
usual. I gathered and cured my grapes, and did every
. necessary thing as before. ,

The rainy season was, in the meantime, upon me, when
I kept more within doors than lat other times. We had
stowed our own vessel as secure as we could, bringing her
up into the creek, where, as 1 said in the beginning, I
landed my rafts from the ship; and hauling her up to the
shore, at high-water mark, I made my man Friday dig a
little dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep

when the tide was out, we made a strong dam across the
end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay dry, as to

that felt not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on;
and before I had time to speak to him, he cries out to me,
Oh, master! oh, master! oh, sorrow! oh, bad! What’s
the matter, Friday? says I. Oh, yonder, there, says he,
one, two, three canoe; one, two, three! By this way of
speaking, I concluded there were six; but, on inquiry, I
found it was but three. Well, Friday, says I, do not be
frightened! So I heartened him up as well as I could;
however, 1 saw the poor fellow was most terribly seared;
for nothing ran in his head but that they were come to look
lor him and would cut him in pieces and eat him; and the
poor fellow trembled so that 1 scarce knew what to do with
him. 1 comforted him as well as 1 could, and told him I
was in as much danger as he, and that they would eat me
as well as him. But, says 1, Friday, we must resolve to
lnoemsou causes. 205
but there come many great number. No matter for that,
said I, again; our guns will fright them that we do not kill.
So I asked him whether, if I resolved to defend him he
would defend me, and stand by me; and do just as I bid
him. He said, Me die when you bid die, master. So I
went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him; for I
= had been so good a husband of my rum, that I had a great
’ deal left. When he drank it, I made him take the two
fowling-pieces, which we always carried, and loaded them

took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs and

brace of bullets each; I hung my great sword, as usual,
naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet. When I
had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective glass, and
went up to the side of the hill, to see what I could dis- .
cover; and I found quickly, by my glass, that there were
one-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes;
and that their whole business seemed to be the triumphant
banquet upon these three human bodies; a barbarous feast
indeed! but nothin more than, as I had observed, Was
usual with them. I observed also that they were landed,
not where they had done when Friday made his escape, but
nearer to my creek; where the shore was low, and where a
thick wood came almost close down to the sea. This, with
the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came

had charged, as be ore, between us; I gave Friday one is-

and I took one pistol, and the other three guns myself;
and in this posture we marched out. I took a small bottle
of}, rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with
more powder and bullets; and, as to orders, I charged him
to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do
anything, till I bid him; and in the meantime not to speak
a word. In this pgslngg 1 fetched a compass to my right

before I should be discovered, which I had seen by my ___ 1
glass it was easy to do. w a,
While I was making this march, my former thoughts re-
turning, I began to abate my resolution; I do not mean
that I entertained any fear of their number; for, as they
were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was superior
to them; ay, though I had been alone. But it occurred
to my thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what
necessity 1 was in, to go and dip my hands in blood, to
attack pegple who had neither done nor intended me any
wrong? ho, as to me, were innocent, and whose bar-
barous customs were their own disaster; being, in them, a
token indeed of God’s having left them, With the other
nations of that part of the world, to such stupidity, and to
such inhuman courses; but did not call me to take upon
me to be a judge of their actions, much less an executioner

take the cause into His own hands, and, by national venge-
ance, unish them, as a people, for national crimes; but
that, m the meantime, it was none of my business; that, it
was true, Friday might justify it, because he was a declared
enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular
pee le, and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I
coud not say the same with respect to myself. These
things were so warmly pressed u on my thoughts 'all the
way as 1 went, that I resolved Ip would only go and place
myself near them, that I might observe their barbarous
feast, and that I would act then as God should direct; but
that, unless something offered that was more a call to me
than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with them.
With this resolution I entered the wood; and, with all
ossible wariness and silence, Friday following close at my
eels, I marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on
the side which was next to them, 'only that one corner of
the wood lay between me and them. Here I called softly
to Friday, and showing him a reat tree, which was just at
the corner of the wood, I b e him go to the tree, and

at his feet. I turned to Friday—Now, Friday, said 1, do
as 1 bid thee. Friday said he would. Then, Friday, says
I, do exactly as you see me do, fail in nothing. So I set
down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon the
ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with the other
musket I took my aim atFthe savages, bidding him to do
the like: then asking him if he was ready, he said, Yes.

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the
side that he shot, he killed two of them, and wounded thret
more; and on my side I killed one, and wounded two.
They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation;
and all of them who were not hurt jumped upon their feet,
but did not immediately know which way to run, or which
way to look, for they knew not from whence their destruc-
tion came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me that, as I had

they ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures,
all bloody, and most of them miserably wounded, whereof
three more fell quickly after, though not quite dead.
Now, Friday, says I, laying down the discharged pieces,
and taking up the musket which was yet loaded, follow me;
which he did,with a great deal of courage; u n which I
rushed out of the wood, and showed mysel , and Frida

scarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket,
and gave it him, making signs that he should drink, which
he did; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he eat.
Then I asked him what countryman he was: and he said,

pulling out my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a
dram; which, with the news of his being delivered, revived
him, and he sat up in the boat. But when Friday came to
hear him speak, and look in his face, it would have moved
any one to tears to have seen how Friday kissed him, em-
braced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped
about, danced, sung; then cried again, wrung his hands,
beat his own face and head; and then sung and jumped
about again, like a distracted creature. It was a good
while before I could make him speak to me, or tell me
what was the matter; but when he came a little to him-

and out of the boat, a. great many times: when he went in
to him, he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold
his father’s head close to his bosom for many minutes to-
gether, to nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles,
which were numbed and stiff with the binding, and chafed
and rubbed them with his hands; and I, perceivrng what

little, I called him to me, and he came jum ing and laugh-
ing, and pleased to the highest extreme: t on I asked him
if he had given his father any bread. He shook his head,
and said, None; ugly dog eat all up self. I then gave him
a cake of bread, out of a little pouch which I carried on
purpose; I also gave him a dram for himself, but he would
not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in my
ocket two or three bunches of raisins, so I gave him a
handful of them for his father. He had no sooner given
his father these raisins, but I saw him come out of the
boat, and run away, as if he had been bewitched, he-ran at
such a rate; for he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that
ever I saw: I say, he ran at such a rate, that he was out
of sight, as it were, in an instant; and though I called,
and hallooed out too, after him, it was all one, away he
went; and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come back
again, though not so fast as he went; and as he came
nearer, 1 found his pace slacker, because he had some-
thing in his hand. When he came up to me, I found that
he had been quite home for an earthen jug or pet, to bring
his father some fresh water, and that he had two more
cakes or leaves of bread ;_the bread he gave me, but the
water he carried to his father; however, as I was verv
thirsty too, I took a little sup of it. The water revived
his father more than all the rum or spirits 1 had given him,

and set him down softly upon the side or gunnel of the
canoe, with his feet in the inside of it; and then, lifting
him quite in, he set himself close to his father; and pres-

and paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk,
though the wind blew pretty hard too: so he brought them
both safe into our creek, and leaving them in the boat,
ran away to fetch the other canoe. As he passed me, I
spoke to him, and asked him whither he went. He told
me, Go fetch more boat: so away he went like the wind,
for sure never man or horse ran like him; and he had the
other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by
land; so he 'wafted me over, and then Went to help our
new guests out of the boat, which he did; but they were
neither of them able to walk, so that poor Friday knew not
what to do.
To remedy this, 1 went to work in my thought, and call-
ing to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he
came to me, I soon made a kind of a hand-barrow to lay
them on, and Friday and I carried them both up together

was resolved not to break it down: so I set to work again;
and Friday and I, in about two hours’ time, made a very
handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above that with
boughs of trees, being in the space without our outward
fence, and between that and the grove of youn wood which
I had planted; and here we made them two eds of such
l
things as 1 had, viz. of good rice straw, with blankets laid
upon it, to lie on, and another to cover them, on each bed.

whole country was my own more property, so that I had an
undoubted right of dominion. Secondly, my people were
perfectly subjected; I was absolutely lord and law-giver;
they all owed their lives to me, and were ready to lay
down their lives, if there had been occasion for it, for me.
It was remarkable, too, I had but three subjects, and they
were of three different religions: my man Friday was a
Protestant, his father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and
the Spaniard was a Papist: however, I allowed liberty of
conscience throughout my dominions. But this is by the
way. '

the savages pretty well.

him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which
lay open to the sun, and would presently be offensive. I
also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their bar-

could not think of doing myself; nay, I could not bear to

must of necessity be drowned, or driven south to those
other shores, where they were as sure to be devoured

but, as to what they would do, if they came safe

that they were so dreadfully frightened with the man'-

and that the two which appeared, viz. Friday and I, were

upon my guard, with all my army: for, as there Were new

In a little time, however, no canoes appearing, the tear
of their coming wore off; and I began to take my former
thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration; being
likewise assured, by Friday’s father, that 1 might depend
upon good usage from their, nation, on his account, it I,
would go. But my thoughts were a little suspended when
I had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I
understood that there were sixteen more of his countrymen
and Portuguese, who, having been cast away, and made
their escape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with
the savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries,
and indeed for life. I asked him all the particulars of their

I asked him what he thought would become of them
there, and if they had formed no design of making any
escape. He said they had many consultations about it;
but that having neither vessel, nor tools to build one, nor
provisions of any kind, their councils always ended in
tears and despair. I asked him how he thought they
would receive a proposal from me, which might tend to-
ward an escape; and whether it they were all here, it
might not be done. I told him with freedom, I feared
mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if 1 put my
life in their hands, for that gratitude was no inherent virt-
ue in the nature of man, nor did men always sq'uare their
dealings by the obligations they had received, so much as
they did by the advantages they expected. I told him it
would be very hard that I should be the instrument of
their deliverance, and that they should afterward make
me their prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman

accident soever brought him thither; and that I had rather
be delivered up to the savages, to be devoured alive, than
to-fall into the merciless claws of the priests, and be car-
tied into the Inquisition. I added, that otherwise I was
ersuaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many
ands, build a bark large enough to carry us all away,
either to the Brazils, southward, or to the islands, or the
Spanish coast, northward; but that if, in requittal, they
should, when I had put weapons into their hands, carry
me by force among their own people, I might be ill used
for my kindness to them, and make my case worse that it
was before. '
He answered with a great deal of candor and in nuous~
sees, that their condition was so miserable, and t ey were
so sensible of it, that he believed they would abhor the
thought oi! using any man unkindly that should contribute
to their deliverance; and that, if 1 pleased, he would go to
them with the old man, and discourse with them about it,
and return again, and bring me their answer; that he would
make conditions with them upon their solemn oath, that
they should be absolutely under my leading, as their com-
mander and captain; and that they should swear, upon the
hol sacraments and gospel, to be true to me, and go to
sue Christian country as that 1 should agree to, and no
other, and to be directed wholly and absolutely by my orders,
till they were landed safely in such country as I intend-
ed; and that he would bring a contract from them, under
their hands, for that purp0se. Then he told me that he

from me as long as he lived, till I gave him orders; and
that he would take my side to the last drop of his blood,
if there should happen the least breach of faith among his
countrymen. He told me they were all of them very civil,
honest men, and they were under the greatest distress im-
aginable, having neither weapons, nor clOthes, nor any food,
but at the mercy and discretion of the savages; out of all
hopes of ever returning to their own country; and that he
was sure, if 1 would undertake their relief, they would live
and die by me.
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve
them, if possible, and to send the old sava e and this Span-
iard over to them to treat. But when we had got all things
in readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started an objec-

we should wait another harvest, that we might have a sup-

was very good living, too, I assure you, for it is exceeding-
ly nourishing. '
It was now harvest, and our crop in good order; it was
not the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island,
but, however, it was enough to answer our end; for from
twenty-two bushels of barley we brought in and threshed
out above two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like
in proportion of the rice; which was store enough for our
food to the next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards
had been on shore with me; or if we had been ready for a
voyage, it would very plentifully have victualed our ship
_ 0 have carried us to any part of the world, that is to say,
any part of America. When we had thus housed and
secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make
more wickerware, viz., great baskets in which we kept it;
and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this
part, and often blamed me that I did not make some things
or defense of this kind of work; but I saw no need of it.
, And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests

I knew they had neither pen nor ink, was a question which
we never asked. Under these instructions, the Spaniard

days, and sufficient for all the Spaniards for about eight
days’ time; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them
go; agreeing with them about a signal they should hang
out at their return, by which I should know them again,
when they came back, at a distance, before they came on
shore. They went away with a fair gale, on the day that
the moon was at full, by my account in the month of Octo-
‘her; but as for an exact reckoning of days, after I had
once lost it, I could never recover it again, nor had I kept
even the number of years so punctually as to be sure I was
right; though, as it proved, when I afterward examined
my account, I found had kept a true reckoning of years.
It was no less than eight days I had waited for them,
when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of
which the like has not~ perhaps been heard of in history. I
was fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when my man
Friday came running in to me,‘and called aloud, Master,
master, thev are come, they are come! I jumped up,v
and, regardless of danger, I went out as soon as I could
get my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by the
way, was by this time grown to be a very thick wood; 1
say, regardless of danger, 1 went without my arms, which
it was not my custom to do; but I was sur rised when,
turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a cat about a
league and a half distant, standing in for the shore, with a
shoulder-of-inutton sail, as they call it, and the wind blow-
ing pretty fair to bring them in; also I observed presently
that they did not come from that side which the shore lay
on, but from the southernmost end of the island. Upon
this, I called Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these
were not the people we looked for, and that we might not
know yet whether they were friends or enemies. 1n the
next Iilace, I went in to fetch my perspective glass, to see
what could make of them; and having taken the ladder
out, I climbed up to the top of the hill, as I used to do
when l was apprehensive of anything, and to take my view
the plainer without being discovered. I had scarce set my
foot upon the bill, when my eye plainly discovered a ship
lying at anchor, at about two leagues and a half dis-
tant from me, S.S.E., but not above a league and a half
from the shore. By my observation, it appeared plain] to
be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an n-
glish long- cat.
I can not express the confusion I was in; though the joy
of seeing a ship, and one that I had reason to' believe was
manned by my own countrymen, and, cons uently, friends,
was such as I can not describe; but yet 1 ad some secret

drive them in there, as in distress; and that if they Were
really English, it was most probable that they were here
upon no good design; and that I had better continue as I
was, than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers.
Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of dan-
get which sometimes are given him when he may think
there is no possibility of its being real. That such hints
and notices are given us, I believe few that have made any
observations of things can deny; that they are certain dis,
coveries of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we
can not doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to be to
warn us of danger, why should we not suppose they are
from some friendly agent (whether supreme, or inferior
and subordinate, is not the question), and that they are
given for our good?

had been undone inevitably, and in a far worse condition
than before, as you will see presently. I had not kept my-
self long in this posture, but I saw the boat draw near the
shore, as if they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the
convenience of landing; however, as they did not come
quite far enough, they did not see the little inlet where I
formerly landed my rafts, but run their boat on shore upon
the beach, at about half a mile from me, which was very
happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed just
at my door, a_s I may say, and would soon have beaten me
out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered me of all I had.

out to me in English, as well as he could, Oh, master! you

Why, riday, says I, do you think they are going to eat
them then? Yes, says Friday, they will eat them. No,
no, sa s I, Friday; I am afraid they will murder them, in,-
deed, at you may be sure they will not eat them.
All this while I had no thought of what the matter really
was, but stood trembling wrth the horror of the sight, ex‘
pecting every moment when the three prisoners should be


killed; nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up his arm
with agreat cutlass, as the seamen call it, or sword, to
strike one of the poor men; and I expected to see him fall
eyery moment; at which all the blood in my body seemed
to run chill in my veins. I wished heartily now for my
Spaniard, and the savage that was gone with him, or that
I had any way to have come undiscovered within shot of
them, that I might have rescued the three men, for I saw

usage of the three men by the insolent seamen, I observed
the fellows run scattering about the island, as if they
wanted to see the country. 1 observed that the three other
men had liberty to go also where they pleased; but they sat
down all three upon the ground, very pensive, and looked

and really they were in a condition of safety, at the same
time that they thought themselves 10st, and their case des-

much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the great
Maker of the world, that He does not leave His creatures
so absolutely destitute, but that, in the worst circum-
stances, they have aiways something to be thankful for,
and sometimes are nearer their deliverance than they in-
agine, nay, are even brought to their deliverance by the
means by which they seem to be brought to destruction.

IT was just at the top of high water when these people
came on shore; and partly while they, rambled about to see
what kind of a (place they were in, they had carelessly
stayed till the ti e was spent, and the water was ebbed
considerably away, leaving their boat aground. They had
left two men in the boat, who, as I found afterward, hav-
ing drunk a little too much brandy, fell asleep; however,

looed out for the rest, who were straggling about; upon
which they all soon came to the boat; ut it was past all
their strength to launch her, the boat being very heavy,
and the shore on that side being a soft, oozy sand, almost
like a quicksaud. In this condition, like true seamen, who
are perhaps the least of all mankind given to forethought,
they gave it over, and away they strolled about the country
again; and I heard one of them say aloud to another, call-
ing them off from the boat, Why, let her alone, Jack,

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any

heat of the day, 1 found that, in short, they were all gone
straggling into the woods, and, as I thought, laid down to
sleep. The three poor distressed men, too anxious for
their condition to get any sleep, were, however, sat down

seemed to make supplication to the brutes that came with
you, I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill you.
The poor man, with tears running down his face, and
trembling, looking like one astonished, returned, Am I
talking to God 01' man? Is it a real man or an angel? Be
in no fear about that, sir, said I; if God had sent an angel
to relieve you, he would have come better clothed, and
armed after another manner than {Eon see me; pray lay

pieces, one of which they left in the boat. Well, then,
said 1, leave the rest to me; I see they are all asleep, it is
an easy thing to kill them all; but shall we rather take
them prisoners? He told me there were two desperate vil-
lains among them that it was scarce safe to show any
mercy to; but if they were secured, he believed all the rest
would return to their duty. I asked him which they were.
He told me he could not at that distance distinguish them,
but he would obey my orders in anything I would direct.
- Well, says I, let us retreat out of their view or hearing,
lest they awake, and we will resolve further. So they
willingly went back with me, till the woods covered us
from them.
Look you, sir, said I, if I venture upon your deliver-
‘ anoe, are you willing to make two conditions with me? He
anticipated my proposals, by telling me, that both he and
the ship, if recovered, should be wholly directed and com-
manded by me in everything; and, ii the ship was not re-
covered, he would live and die with me in what part of the
world soever I would send him; and the two other men
said the same. Well, says I, my conditions are but two;

me and my man to England passage free.
He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith
of man could devise, that he would comply with these
most reasonable demands; and, besides, would owe his life
to me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions, as long as he
lived. Well, then, said I, here are three muskets for yen,

the shot. He said very modestly that he was loath to kill
them, if he could help it; but that those two were incon-
rigible villains and' had been the authors of all the mutiny
in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone still;
for they would go on board and bring the whole ship’s
company, and destroy us all. Well, then, says I, necessity
legitimates my advice, for it is the only way to save our
lives. However, seeing him still cautious of shedding
blood, I told him they should go themselves and manage
as they found convenient.
In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them
awake, and soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I
asked him if either of them were the heads of the mutiny?
He said no. Well, then, said I, you may let them escape;
and Providence seems to have awakened them on purpose
to save themselves. Now, says I, if the rest escape you,
it is your fault. Animated with this, he took the musket
I had given him in his hand, a pistol in his belt, and his
two comrades with him, with each a piece in his hand; the

at which one of the seamen who was awake turned about,
and seeing them coming, cried out to the rest; but it was

iece. They had so well aimed their shot at the men they
new, that one of them was killed on the s t, and the
other very much wounded; but not being dea , he started
up on his feet, and called eagerly for hel to the others;
but the ca tain stepping to him, told him it was too late to
cry for he p, he should call upon God to forgive his vil-
lainy; and with that word knocked him down ‘with the
stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more; there
were three more in the company, and one of them was also
slightly wounded. By this time I was come; and when
they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to resist,
they begged for mercy. The captain told them he would
spare their lives, if they would give him any assurance of
t eir abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of,
and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the
ship, and afterward in carrying her back to Jamaica, from
whence they came. They gave him all the protestations
of their sincerity that could be desired, and he was willing
to believe them, and spare their'lives, which 1 wa not
against, only that 1 obliged him to keep them bound hand
and foot while they were on the island.
While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain’s
mate to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring
away the cars and sails, which they did; and by and by
three straggling men, that were, happily for them, parted

upon himself, and how I seemed to have been preserved

men into my apartment, leading them in just where I
came out, viz., at the top of the house, where I refreshed
them with such provisions as 1 had, and showed them all
the contrivances I had made during my-long, long in-
habiting that place.

tion, and how perfectly I had concealed my retreat with av
grove of trees, which, having been new planted near twenty
years, and the trees growing much faster than in England,
was become a little wood, and so thick, that it was im-
passable in any part of it, but at that one side where I had
reserved my little winding passage into it. I told him this
was my castle and my residence, but that I had a seat in
the country, as most princes have, whither I could retreat
upon occasion, and I would show him that too another
time; but at present our business was to consider how to
recover the ship. He agreed with me as to that; but told
me he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take, for
that there were still six-and-twenty hands on board, who
having entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which they had
all forfeited their lives to the law, would be hardened in l“
now by desperation, and would carry it on, knowing that,
if they were subdued, they would be brought to the gal-
lows, as soon as they came to England, or to any of the
English colonies; and that, therefore, there would be no
attacking them with so small a number as we were.
I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found
it was a very rational conclusion, and that, therefore, some-
thing was to be resolved on speedily, as well to draw the
men on board into some snare fo. their surprise, as to pre-
vent their landing u on us, and destroying us. Upon this
it presently occur-re to me that in a little while the ship’s
crew, wondering what was become of their comrades, and
of the boat, would certainly come on shore in their other
‘ boat, to look for them; and that th.n, perhaps, they might
come armed, and be too strong for us; this he allowed to

to do was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so
that they might not carry her oif; and taking everything

accordingly we went on board, took the arms which were

which was very welcome to me, especially the brandy and
sugar, of which 1 had none left for many years.
When we had carried all these things on shore (the cars,
mast, sail and rudder of the boat were carried away be-
fore, as above), we knocked a great hole in her bottom,
that if they had come strong enough to master us, yet they
could not carr off the boat. Indeed, it was not much in
my thoughts t at we could be able to recover the ship; but
my view was, that if they went away without the boat, I

as they approached, that there were no less than ten men

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we
had a full view of them as they came, and a plain sight
even of their faces; because the tide having set them a lit-
tle to the east of the other heat, they rowed up under shore,
to come to the same place where the other had landed, and
where the boat lay; by this means, I say, we had a full view
of them, and the captain knew the persons and characters
of all the men in the boat, of whom, he said, there were

smiled at him, and told him that men in our circum-
stances were past the operation of fear; that seeing almost
every condition that could be was better than that which
we were supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the
consequence, whether death or life, would be sure to be a
deliverance. I asked him what he thought of the circum-
stances of my life, and whether a deliverance were not
worth venturing for? And where, sir, said 1, is your be-
lief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your life,
which elevated you a little while ago; for my part, said I,
there seems to me but one thing amiss in all the prospect
of it. What is that? says he. Why, says 1, it is, that as
you say there are three or four honest feilew's among them,
which should be spared, had they been all of the wicked
part of the crew, I should have thought God’s providence
ad singled them out to deliver them into your hands; fon,

and were very thankful that they had such good usage as
to have provisions and light left them; for Friday gave them
candles (such as we made ourselves) for their comfort; and
they did not know but that he stood sentinel over them at
the entrance. ,
The other prisoners had better usage: two of them were
kept pinioned, indeed, because the captain was not free to
trust them; but the other two were taken into my service,
upon the captain’s recommendation, and upon their
solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them
and the three honest men we were seven men well armed;
and I made no doubt we should be able to deal well enough
with the ten that were coming, considering that the cap-
tain had said that there were three or four honest men
among them also. As soon as they got to the place where
their other boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and
came on shore, hauling the boat up after them, which 1
was glad to see; for l was afraid they would rather have

set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their
might, to try if they could make their companions hear;
but all was to no purpose: then they came all close in a

We card, and the echoes made the woods ring; but it was
all one: those in the cave we were sure could not hear; and
those in our keeping, though they heard it well enough,
yet durst give no answer to them. They were so aston-
ished at the surprise of this, that, as they told us after-
ward, they resolved to go all on board again to their ship,
and let them know that the men were all murdered, and
the long-boat staved; accordingly, they immediately
launched their boat again, and got all of ther )n board.
The captain was terribly amazed and eve . confounded
at this, believing they would go on board the ship again,
and set sail, giving their comrades over for lost, and so he
should still lose the ship, which he was in bones we should
have recovered; but he was quickly as much frightened the
other way.
They had not been long put off with the boat, but we
perceived them all coming on shore again; but with this
new measure in their conduct, which it seems they con-
sulted together upon, viz., to leave three men in the boat,
and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to
look for their fellows. This was a great disappointment to
us', for now we Were at a loss what to do; as our seizing
these seven men on shore would be no advantage to us, if
we let the boat escape; because they would then row away
to the ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to
weigh and set sail, and so our recovering the ship would be
lost. However, we had no remedy but to wait and see
what the issue of things might present. The seven men
came on shore, and the three who remained in the boat put

to come at them in the boat. Those that came on shore
kept close together, marching toward the top of the little

the other part of them had done, they had done the job for
us; but they were too full of apprehensions of danger to
venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell what the

T e captain made a very just proposal to me upon this

and that we -.' ould all sally upon them, just at the juncture
when their pieces were all discharged, and they Would cer-

I liked this proposal, provided it was done while we were
near enough to come up to them before they could lead
their ieces again. But this even did not happen; and we
lay still a long time, very irresolute what course to take.
At) length I told them there would be nothing done, in my
opinion, till night; and then, if they did not return to the

the shore, and so might use some stratagem with them in
the boat to get them on shore. We waited a great while,
though very impatient for their removing; and were very
Uneasy, when, after long consultations, we saw them all
start up, and march down toward the sea: it seems they
had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the danger
of the place, that they resolved to go on board the ship
again, give their companions over for 10st, and so go on
with their intended voyage with the ship.
As soon as I perceived them go toward the shore, I imag-
ined it to be, as it really was, that they had given over their
search, and were for gain back again; and the captain, as
soon as I told him my t oughts, was ready to sink at the
apprehensions of it: but I presently thought of a stratagem
to fetch them back again, and which answered my end to
a tittle. I ordered Friday and the ca tain’s mate to go
over the little creek westward, toward t e place where the
savages came on shore when Friday Was rescued, and as
soon as they came to a little rising ground, at about half a
mile distance, 1 bade them halloo out, as loud as they could,
and wait till they found the seamen heard them; that as
soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them, they
should return it again; and then keeping out of si ht, take
a round, always answering when the others hal coed, to
draw them as far into the island, and among the woods. es
possible, and then wheel about again to me, by such ways
as I directed them. '
7 They were just going into the boat when Friday and the
mate hallooed: and they presently heard them, and answer-
ing, ran along the shore westward, toward the voice they
heard, when they were presently stopped by the creek,
where the water being up, they could not get over, and
called for the boat to come up and set them over; as, in-
deed, I eXpeoted. When they had set themselves ever, I
observed that the boat being gone a good way into the
creek, and, as it were, in a harbor within the land, the
took one of the three men out of her, to go along wit
them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened her
to the stump of a little tree on the shore. This was what
I wished for; and immediately leaving Friday and the cap-
tain’s mate to their business, 1 took the rest with me, and
crossing the creek out of‘ their sight, we surprised the two
men before they were aware; one of them lyin on the
shore, and the other being in the boat. The ellow on
shore was between sleeping and waking, and goin to start
up; the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon im, and
knocked him down; and then called out to him in the boat
to yield, or he was a dead man. There needed very few
arguments to persuade a single man to yield, when he saw

sides, this was, it seems, one of the three who were not so
hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore
was easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterward to
join very sincerely with us. In the meantime, Frida and
the captain’s mate so well managed their business wit the
rest, that they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from
one hill to another, and irorn one wood to another, till they
not only heartily tired them, but left them where they were
very sure they could not reach back to the boat before it
was dark; and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves
also, by the time they came back to us.
We had nothing new to do but to watch for them in the
dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with
them. It: was several hours after Friday came back to me
before they came back to their boat; and we could hear the
foremost of them, long before they came quite up, calling
to those behind to come along; and could also hear them
answer, and complain how lame and tired they were, and

not able to come any faster, which was very welcome news
to us. At length they came up to the boat: but it it im-
possible to express their confusion when they found the boat
ast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two
men gone. We could hear them call to one another in a
most lamentable manner, telling one another they were got
into an enchanted island: that either there were inhabitants
in it, and they should all so murdered, or else there were
devils and/spirits in it, and they should be all carried away
and devoured. They hallooed again, and called their two
comrades by their names a great many times; but no an-
swer. After some time, we could see them, by the little
light there was, run about, wringing their hands like men
in despair; and that sometimes they would go and sit down
in the boat, to rest themsclves; then come ashore again, and
walk about again, and do the same thing over again: My
men would fain have had me give them leave to fall upon
them at once in the dark; but I was willing to take them
at some advantage, so to spare them, and kill as few of
them as I could; and especially I was unwilling to hazard
the killing of any of our men, knowing the others were
very well armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not
separate; and, therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my
ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to
creep upon their hands and feet, as close to the ground. as
they could, that they might not be discovered, and get as
near them as-they could possibly, before they offered to
236 nosrnson causes.
They had not been long in that posture, when the boat-
swain, who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and
had now shown himself the most dejected and dispirited of
all the rest, came walking toward them, with two more of
the crew: the captain was so eager at having this principal
.rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have
patience to let him come so near as to be sure of him, for
they only heard his tongue before: but when they came
nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on their feet,

advanced with my whole army, which was now eight men,
vm, myself, generahssimp; Friday, my lieutenant-general;
the captain and his two men, and the three prisoners of
war, whom we had trusted with arms. We came upon
them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see our
number; and 1 made the man they had left in the boat,
who was now one of us, to‘call them by name, to'try if I
could bring them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce
them to terms; which fell out just as we desired: for, in-
deed, it was easy to think, as their condition than was, they
would be willing to capitulate. So he calls out, as loud as
he could, to one of them, Tom Smith! Tom Smith! Tom,
Smith answered immediately, Is that Robinson? For it
seems he knew the voice. The other answered, Ay, ay;

and if you do not yield. you are all lost. Will they give
us quarter then? says Tom Smith, and we will yield. I
will go ask, if you promise to yield, says Robinson: so he
asked the captain; and the captain himself then calls out,

arms immediately, and submit, you shall have your lives,

three were in all but eight, came up and seized u on them,
and upon their boat; only that I kept mysel and one
more out of sight for reasons of state.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seiz-
ing the ship: and as for the captain, now he had leisure to
parley with them, he expostulated with them upon the
villainy of their practices with him, and- at length upon the
further wickedness of their design, and how certainly it
must bring them to misery and distress in the end, and
perhaps to the allows. They all ap cared very penitent,
and begged bar for their lives. As or that, he told them
they were none of his prisoners, but the commander’s of
the island; that they thought they had set him on shore on
a barren, uninhabited island; but it had leased God so to
direct them, that it was inhabited, and t at the governor
was an Englishman; that he might hang them all there,
if be pleased; but as he had given them all quarter, he
supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with
there as 'ustice required, except Atkins, whom he was com-
mauded y the governor to advise to prepare for death, for
that he would be hanged in the morning.

its desired eifect: Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the
captain to intercede with the governor for his life; and all
the rest begged of him, for God’s sake, that they might
not be sent to England.
It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance
was come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring
these fellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the
ship; so I retired in the dark from them, that they might
not see what kind of a governor they had, and called the
captain to me: when 1 called, as at a good distance, one o!

tain, Captain, the commander calls for you ; and present y

to put it in execution the next morning. But, inorder to
execute it with more heart, and to be secure of success, I

go and take Atkins and two more of the worst of them, and
send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This
was committed to Friday and the two men who came on
shore with the captain. They conveyed them to the cave
as to a prison: and it was, indeed, a dismal place. especi-
ally to men in their condition. The others I ordered to
my bower, as I called it, of which I have given a full de-
scription: and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the ¢
place was secure enough, considering they were upon their
‘ ehavior.
To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to
enter into a parley with them; in a word, to try them, and
tell me whether he thought they might be trusted or no to
go on board and surprise the ship. He talked to them of
the injury done him, of the condition they were brought to,
and that though the governor had given them quarter for
their lives as to the present action, yet that if they were
sent to England they would all be hanged in chains, to
be sure; but that if they would join in so just an attempt
as to recover the ship, he would have the gOVernor’s engage-
ment for their pardon.

accepted by men in their condition; they fell down on their
knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest im pre-
eations, that they would be faithful to him to the lastdrop,
and that they should owe their lives to him, and would go
with him all over the world; that they would own him as
a father as long as they lived. Well, says the captain, I
must go and tell the governor what you say, and see what
I can do to bring him to consent to it. So he brought me
an account of the temper he found them in, and that he
verily believed they would be faithful. However, that we
might be very secure, I told him he should go back again

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with

direction; that if they did, they would be fetched into the
castle, and be laid in irons; so that as we never suffered

faithfully seconded by their men: they secured all the rest

that were upon the main and quarter-decks, and began to
fasten the ' atches, to keep them down that were below;
when the other boat and their men, entering at the fore-
chains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle
which went down into the cook-room, making three men
they found there prisoners. When this was done, and all safe
upon. deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three men,
to break into the round-house, where the new rebel captain

sure I was very glad to hear, having sat watching u on the
shore for it till near two o’clock in the morning. Iaving
thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down, and it having
been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I
was something surprised with the noise of a gun; and pres-
ently starting up, I heard a. man call me by the name of
Governor, Governor, and presently I knew the captain’s
voice; when climbing up to the top of the hill, there he
stood, and pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his
arms. My dear friend and deliverer, says he, there’s
your ship, for she is all yours, and so are we, and all that
belong to her. I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she
rode within a little more than half of a mile of the shore;
for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were
masters of her, and the weather being fair, had brought
her to anchor just against the mouth of the little creek;
and the tide being up, the captain had brought the pinnace

put into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just

for some time, I was not able to answer him one word; but
as he had taken me in his arms, I held fast by him, or I
should have fallen to the ground. He perceived the sur-
prise, and immediately ullcd a bottle out of his pocket, and
gave me a dram of cor ial, which he had brought on pur-
pose for me. After I had drunk it, I hadisat down upon
the ground; and though it brought me to myself, yet it was
a good while before 1 could speak a word to him. All thi
time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as 1, only
not under any surprise, as I was; and he said a thousand
kind and tender things to me, to compose and bring me to
myself: but such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it
put all my spirits into confusion; at last it broke out into
tears; and in a little while after I recovered my speech. 1
then took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and
we rejoiced together. I told him I looked upon him as a
man sent from Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole
transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders; that such
things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand
of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that

fulness to Heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless
Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner provided
for me in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condi-
tion, but from whom every deliverance must always be
acknowledged to proceed?
When we had talked awhile, the captain told me he had

and such as the wretches that had been so long is masters
had not plundered him of. Upon this he called aloud to
the boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore that
were for the governor; and, indeed, it was a present as if
it had been one that was not to be carried away with them,
but as if I had been to dwell upon the island still. First,
he had brought me a case of bottles full of excellent cor-
dial waters, six large bottles of Maderia wine (the bottles
held two quarts each), two pounds of excellent good to-
bacco, twelve good nieces Of..shio’s beef. and six pieces of
pork, with a bag of pease, and about a hundred~weight of
nosmson causes. 243
a bag, full of lemons, and two bottles of lime juice, and
abundance of other things. But, besides these, and what
was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me
six new clean shirts, six very good neck-cloths, two pair of
gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings,
with a very good suit of clothes of his own, which had been
worn but very little; in a word, he clothed me from head to
feet. It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one
may imagine, to one in my circumstances; but never was
anything in the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward,

After these ceremoinies were past, and after all these
good things were brought into my little apartment, we
began to consult what was to be done with the prisoners We
had; for it was worth considering whether we might
venture to take them awa with us or no, especially two of
them, whom we knew to e incorrigible and refractory to
the last degree; and the captain said he knew they
were such rogues, that there was no obliging them; and if _
he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as malefac-

ony he could come at; and 1 found that the captain himself
was very anxious about it. Upon this I told him, that if
he desired it, I would undertake to bring the two'men he
spoke of to make it their own request that he should leave
t em upon the island. I should be very glad of that, says
the captain, with all my heart. Well, says I, I will send
them up, and talk with them for you. So I caused Friday
and the two hostages, for they were now discharged, there

ioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them there till
1 came. After some time, I came thither dressed in my new
habit; and now I was called governor, again. Being all
met, and the captain with me, I caused the men to be
brought before me, and I told them I had got a. full ac-
count oi their villainous behavior to the captain, and how
they had run away with the ship, and were preparing to
commit further robberies, but that Providence had in-
snared them in their own ways, and that they were fallen
into the , it which ,(‘1 * bed dug for others. Ilet them
know that by my direction the ship had been seized; and
that she now lay in the road; and they might see, by and
by, that their new captain had received the reward of his
villainy, and that they would see him hanging at the yard-
arm: that as to them, I wanted to know what they had to
say why I should not execute them as pirates, taken in the
fact, as by my commission they could not doubt but I had
authority to so do. \
One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they
had nothing to say but this, that when they were taken,
the captain promised them their lives, and they humbly im~
plored my mercy. But I told them I knew not what mercy
to show them; for as for myself, I had resolved to quit the
island with all my men, and had taken passage with the
captain to go for England; and as for the captain, he could
not carry them to England other than as prisoners, in irons,
to be tried for mutiny, and running away with the ship;
the consequence of which, they must needs know, would
be the gallows; so that 1 could not tell what was best for
them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in the isl-
and: if they desired that, as I had liberty to leave the island,
1 had some inclination to give 'them their lives, if they
thought they could shift on shore. They seemed very
thankful for it, and said they would much rather venture
to stay there than be carried to England to be hanged: so I
left it on that issue.
However, the captain seemed to make some diiiiculty of
it, as if he durst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed
a little angry with the captain, and told him that they were

might take them again if he could catch them. Upon this
they appeared very thankful, and I accordingly set them at

to go on board the ship; but told the captain I would stay
that night to prepare my things, and desired him to go on
board, in the meantime, and keep all right in the ship,
and send the boat on shore next day for me; ordering
him, at all events, to cause the new captain, who was killed,
go be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men might see
1m.
When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to
me to my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse
with them on their circumstances. I told them I thought
they had made a right choice; that if the captain had car-
ried them away, they would certainly be hanged. 1 showed
them the new captain hanging at the yard-arm at the ship,
and told them they had nothing less to expect. -
When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I
then told them I would let them into the story of my liv-
ing there, and put them into the way of making it easy to
them: accordingly, I gave them the whole history of the
noemson causes. 24-5
tions, the way 1 made my bread, planted my corn, cured
my grapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to make
them easy. I told them the story also of the seventeen
Spaniards that were to be expected, for whom I left a let-
ter, and made them promise to treat them in common with
themselves. Here it may be noted, that the ca tain, who
had ink on board, was greatly surprised that Fuever hit

but little, and wasted none. I gave t em a description of
the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and
fatten them, and to make both butter and cheese: in a
word, 1 gave them every part of my own story, and told
them I should prevail with the captain to leave them two
barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden seeds, which
I told them I would have been very glad of: also I gave
them the bag of pease which the captain had brought me to
eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase them.
Having done all this, I left them the next day, and went
on board the ship. We pre ared immediately to sail, but
did not weigh that night. T e next morning early, two of

ing a meet lamentable complaint of the other three, begged,
to be taken into the ship, for God’s sake, for they shbuld

board, though he hanged them immediately. Upon this,
the captain pretended to have no power without me ; but
after some difficulty, and after their solemn promises of
amendment, they were taken on board, and were some
time after soundly whipped and pickled 2 after which they
proved very honest and quiet fellows.
Some time after this the boat was ordered on shore, the
tide being up, with the things promised to the men ; to
which the captain, at my intercession, caused their chests
and clothes to be added, which they took, and were very
thankful for. I also encouraged them by telling them
that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them
in, I would not forget them.
When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for
relics, the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella,
and one of my parrots; also I forgot not to take the money
I formerly mentioned, which had laid by me so long useless
that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly pass
for silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled ; as
also the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship.
And thus I, left the island, the 19th of December, as I
found by the ship’s account, in the year 1686, after I had
been upon it eight-and-twenty years, two months, and
nineteen days ; being delivered from this second captivity

When I came to England I was as perfect a strager to
all the world as if 1 had never been known there. My
benefactor and faithful steward, whom I had left my
money in trust with, was alive, but had had great misfort-
unes in the world ; was become a widow the second time,
and very low in the world. I made her very easy as to
what she owed me, assuring her I would give her no

care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little stock
would afford ; which at that time would, indeed, allow me
to do but little for her; but I assured her I would never
forget her former kindness to me ; nor did I forget her

its proper place. I went down afterward into Yorkshire;

but my father was dead, and my mother and all the family
extinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of the
children'of one of my brothers ; and as I had been long
ago given over for dead, there had been no provision made
for me ; so that, in a word, I found nothing to relieve or
assist me ; and that the little money I had would not do
much for me as to settling in the world.
I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did
not expect ; and this was, that the master of the ship
whom I had so happily delivered,and by the same means
saved the ship and cargo, having given a very handsome
account to the owners of the manner how I had saved the
lives of the men and the ship, they invited me to meet
them and some other merchants concerned, and all together
made me a.very handsome compliment upon the subject,
and a present of almost two hundred pounds sterling.

stances of my life,-and how little way this would go toward
settling me in the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and
see if I might not come at some information of the state
of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what was become of
my partner, who I had reason to suppose, had some years
past given me over for dead. With this view I took ship-
ping for Lisbon, where I arrived in April following, my
man Friday accompanying me very honestly in all these
ramblings, and proving ' a most faithful servant upon all
occasions. When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by in-
quiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my old friend the

shore of Africa. He was now grown old, and had left off
going to sea, having put his son, who was far from a young
man, into his ship, and who still used the Brazil trade.
The old man did not know me ; and indeed, I hardly knew
him ; but I soon brought him to my remembrance, and as
soon brought myself to his remembrance when I told him
who I was.
After some passionate expressions of the old acquaint-
ance between us, I inquired, you may be sure, after my
plantation and my partner. The old man told me he had
not been in the Brazils for about nine years ; but that he
could assure me that when he came away my partner was
living ; but the trustees whom I had joined with him to
take cognizance of my part were both dead: that, however,
he believed I would have a very good account of the im-l
provement of the plantation ; for that, upon the general
belief of my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had
given the account of the produce of my part of the plan-

sion of the Indians to the Catholic faith : but that, if I ap-
peared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it
would be restored ; onl that the improvement, or annual
production, being distributed to charitable uses, could not
'be restored ; but he assured me that the steward of the
king’s revenue from lands, and the providore, or steward
of the monastery, had taken great care all along'that the in-
cumbent, that is to say, my partner, gave every year a faith-
ful account of the produce, of which they had duly received
my moiety. I asked him if 'he knew to what height of im-
provement he had brought_the plantation, and whether
he thought it might be worth looking after; or whether,
on my going thither, I should meet with any obstruction
to my possessing my just right in_ the moiety. He told me
he could not tell exactly to what degree the plantation was
improved ; but this he knew, that my partner was grown
exceeding rich upon the enjoying his part of it ; and that,
to the best of his remembrance, he had heard that the
king's third of my part, which was, it seems, granted away
to some other monastery or religious house, amounted to
above two hundred moidores a year ; that as to my being
restored to a quiet possession of, there was no question
to be made of that, my partner being alive to witness my
title, and my name being also enrolled in the register of
the country ; also he told me that the survivors of my two
trustees were very fair, honest peOple, and very wealthy ;
and he believed I would not only have their assistance for

able sum of money in their hands for my account, being
the produce of the farm while their fathers held the trust,
and before it was given up, as above; which, as he remem-
bered, was for about twelve years.
I showed myself alittle concerned and uneasy at this ac—
count. and inquired of the old captain how it came to pass
that the trustees should thus dispose of my effects, when
he knew that I had made my will, and had made him, the
Portuguese captain, my universal heir, etc.
/ He told me that was true; but that as there was no proof
of mybeing dead, he could not act as my executor until some
certain accbunt should come of my death; and, besides, he
was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote : that
it was true he had registered my will and put in his claim ;
and could he have given any account of my being dead or
aliVe, he would have acted by procuration, and taken pos-
session of the ingenio (so they call the sugar-house), and
have given his son, who was now at the Brazils, orders to
do it. “Bnt,” says the old man, “ I have one piece of
news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable
to you as the rest; and that is, believing you were lost, and
all the world believing so also, your partner and trustees

at that time great disbursements for increasing the works,
building an lngenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount
to near so much as afterward it produced ; however," says
the old man, “ I shall give you a true account of what I.
,have received in all, and how I have disposed of it.”

merchant-trustees, being always delivered in goods—viz.,

ably increased; but, as above, the disbursements being

he having been shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about
eleven years after my leaving the place. The good man
then began to complain of his misfortunes. and how he
had been obliged to make use of my money to recover his
losses, and buy him a share in a new ship. “ However,
my old friend,” says he, “ you shall not want a supply in
your necessity ; and as soon as my son returns you shall be

gold ; and giving the writings of his title to the ship which _
his son was gone to the Brazils in, of which he was quarter
part owner, and his son another, he puts them both into
my hands for security of the rest.
I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of
the poor man to be able to b tar this ; and remembering
what he had done for me, how he had taken me up at sea,
and how generously he had used me on all occasions, and
particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could
hardly refrain weeping at what he had said to me ; there-
fore I asked him if his circumstances admitted him to spare
so much money at that time, and if it would not straiten
him? He told me he could not say but it might straiten
him a little ; but, however, it was my money, and I might
want it more than he.
Everything the good man said was full of affection, and
I could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke ; in short,
I took one hundred of. the moidores, and called for a pen
and ink to give him a receipt for them ; then I returned
him the rest, and told him if ever I had possession of the
plantation I would return the other to him also (as, in-
deed, I afterward did) ; and that as to the bill of sale of
his part in his son’s ship, I would not take it by any means;
but that if I wanted the money, I found he was honest
enough to pay me ; and if I did not, but came to receive
what he gave me reason to expect, I would never have a
penny more from him.
When this was past, the 0m man asked me if he should
put me into a method to make my claim to my plantation.
I told him I thought to go over to it myself. IH€ said I
might do so if I pleased, but that if I did not, there were
ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to ap‘

me to send it, with a letter of his writing, to a merchant
of his acquaintance at the place, and then proposed my
staying with him till an account came of the return.
Never was anything more honorable than the proceedings
upon this procuration; for in less than seven months I re-
ceived a large packet from the survivors of my trustees;
the merchants for whose account I went to sea, in which
were the following particular letters and papers inclosed:
First, there was the account current of the produce of my
farm or plantation, from the year when their fathers had bal-
anced with my old Portugal captain, being for six years; the
balance appeared to be one thousand one hundred and
seventy-four moidores in my favor.
SecOndIy, there was the account of four years more,
while they kept the effects in their hands, before the gov-

a person ‘not to be found, which they called civil death;
and the balance of this, the value of the plantation increasing,
amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-six

not being able to account for what was disposed of by the
hospital, very honestly declared he had eight hundred and

edged to my account. As to the king's part, that refunded
nothing. ‘
There was a letter of my partner's: congratulating me
very affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an ac-
count how the estate was improved and what it produced
a year; with the particulars of the number of squares or
acres that it contained, how planted, how many slaves
there were upon it: and making two and twenty crosses
for blessings; told me he had said so many Ave Marias to
thank the Blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me very
passionately to come over and take possession of my own
and in the meantime to give him orders to whom he should
deliver my effects if I did not come myself; concluding

I had now to consider which way to steer my course next,
and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus
put into my hands ; and, indeed, I had more care upon my
head now than I had in my state of life in the island,
where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing
but what I wanted; whereas I had now a great charge upon
me, and my business was how to secure it; I had not a
cave now to hide my money in, or a place where it might
lie without lock or key till it grew moldy and tarnished
before anybody would meddle with it ; on the cOntrary, I-
knew not where to put it or whom to trust with it. My
, old patron the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was
the only refuge I had. In the next place, my interest in
the Brazils seemed to summon me thither; but now I
could not tell how to think of going thither till I had
settled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands

who I knew was honest, and would be just to me'; but
then she was in years, and but poor, and, for aught I
knew, might be in debt ; so that, in a word, I had no way
but to go back to England myself and take my effects with
me. It was some months, however, before I resolved upon
this; and, therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain
fully, and to his satisfaction, who had been my former
benefactor, so I began to think of the poor widow, whose

pounds from me, and to talk with her and comfort her in-
, her poverty, by telling her she should, if I lived, have a
further supply; at the same time I sent" my two sisters in
the country a hundred pounds each, they being, though
' not in want, yet not in very good circumstances, one hav-
ing been married and left a widow, and the other having
a husband not so kind to her as he should be; But among
all my relations or acquaintances I could not yet pitch
upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock,
that I might go away to the Brazils and leave things safe
behind me ; and this greatly perplexed me.
I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils and have
settled myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalized to
the place ; but I had some little scruple in my mind about
religion, which insensibly drew me back. However, it was
not religion that kept me from going there for the present;
and as I had made no scruple of being openly of the re-
ligion of the country all the while I was among them, so
neither did I yet ; only that, now and then, having of late
thought more of it than formerly, when I began to think
of living and dying among them, I began to regret having
professed myself a Papist, and thought it might not be the
best religion to die with. ' ‘
But, as I_ have said, this was not the main thing that
kept me from going to the Brazils, but that really I did
not know with whom to leave my effects behind me; so I
resolved at last to go to England, where, if I arrived, I

upon me so much that though I had once shipped my
baggage in order to go, yet I altered my mind, and that
not once, but two or three times.
It is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this
might be one of the reasons ;‘but let no man slight the
strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such mo-
ment: two of the ships which I had singled out to go in—I
mean more particularly singled out than any other, having
put my things on board one of them, and in the other hav-
ing agreed with the captain—I say two of these ships mis-
carried: one was taken by the Algerines, and the other
was lost on the Start, near Torbay, and all the people
drowned except three ; so that in either of those vessels I
had been made miserable. .
Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot,
to whom I communicated everything, pressed me earnestly
not to go by sea, but either to go by land to the Groyne,
and cross over the Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence
it was but an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and
so to Calais and Dover ; or to go up to Madrid, and so all
the way by land through France. In a word, I was so pre-
possessed against my going by sea at all, except from Calais
to Dover, that I resolved to travel all the way by land;
which, as I was not in haste, and did not value the charge,
Was by much the pleasanter way ; and to make it more so,
my old captain brought an English gentleman, the son of
a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me;
after which we picked up two more'English merchants
also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going

servants ; the two merchants and the two Portuguese con-
tenting themselves with one servant between two, to save
the charge; and as for me, I got an English sailor to travel
with me as a servant, besides my man Friday, who was too
much a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of a
servant on the road.
In this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our company
being very well mounted and armed, we made a little
troop, whereof they did me the honor to call me captain,
as well because I was the oldest man, as because I had two
servants, and, indeed, was the origin of the whole journey.
As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so
I shall trouble you now with none of my land journals; but
some adventures that happened to us in this tedious and
difficult journey I must not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we being all of \us strangers
to Spain, were willing to stay some time to see the Court of
Spain and what was worth observing; but it being the .
latter part of the summer, we hastened away, and set out
from Madrid about the middle of October; but when we
came to the edge of the-Navarre we were alarmed, at several
towns on the way, with an account that so much snow was
falling on the French. side of the mountains that several
travelers were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after
having attempted at an extreme hazard to tpass on.
When we came to Pampeluna itself, we ound it so in-
deed; and to me, that had been always used to a hot
climate, and to countries where I could scarce bear any
clothes on, the cold was insufferablejndr, indeed, was it
more painful than surprising to come but ten days before
out of Old Castile, where the weather was not only warm
but very hot, and immediately to feel a, wind from the
Pyrenean Mountains so very keen, so severely cold, as to
be intolerable, and to endanger benumbing and perishing
256 ROBINSON causon.
Poor Friday was really frightened when. he saw the
mountains all covered with snow and ,felt cold weather,
which he had never seen or felt before in his life. To
mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna it continued
snowing with so much violence and so long, that the people
said winter was come before its time; and the roads, which

word, the snow lay in some places too thick for us to
travel, and being not hard frozen, as is the case in the
northern countries, there was no going without bein in
danger of being, buried alive every step. We stave no
less than twenty days at Pampeluna; when (seeing the
winter coming on, and no likelihood of its being better, for
it was the severest winter all over Europe that had been
known in the memory of man) I proposed that we should
go away to Fontarabia. and there take shipping for Bor-
deaux, which was a very little voyage. But while I was
considering this, there came in four French gentlemen,
who, having been stopped on the French side of the passes,
as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who,
traversing the country near the head of Languedoc, had
brought them over the mountains by such ways that they '
were not much incommoded with the snow; for where they
met with snow in any quantity, they said it was frozen hard
enough to hear them and their horses. We sent for' this
guide, who told us he would undertake to carry us the
same way, with no hazard from the snow, rovi ed we were

for,- he said, in these great snows it was freque t for some
wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains,
being made ravenous for want of food, the, ground being
covered with snow. We told him we were Well enough

told, we were in most danger from, especially, on~ the

was no danger of that kind in the way that we were to go;
so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other
gentlemen with their servants, some French, some Spanish,
who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to
come back again.
Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna with our guide
on the 15th of November ; and, indeed, I was surprised,
when, instead of going forward, he came directly back with
us on the same road that we came from Madrid, about
twenty miles ; when, having passed two rivers, and come
into the plain country, ,we found ourselves in a warm
climate. again, where the country was pleasant, and no
snow to be seen ; but, on a sudden, turning to his left, he
approached the mountains another way ; and though it is
true the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he made
so many tours, such meanders, and led us by such winding
ways, that we insensibly passed the height of the mount-
ains without being much encumbered with the snow ; and


all on a sudden he showed us the pleasant and fruitful

ishing, though at a great distance, and we had some rough
way to'pass still.‘ I
We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it
snowed one whole day and night so fast that we could not
travel ; but be bid us be easy ; we would soon be past it
all ; we found, indeed, that we began to descend every day
and to come more north than before ; and so, depending
upon our guide we went on.
It was about two hours before night when, our guide
being something before us, and not just in sight, out
rushed three monstrous wolves, and after them a bear,
from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood ; two of the
wolves made at the guide, and had he been far before us,
he would have been devoured before we could have helped
him ; one of them fastened upon his horse, and the other
attacked the man with such violence that he had not time
or presence of mind enough to draw his pistol, but hallooed
and cried out to us most lustily. My man ‘Friday being
next me, I bade him ride up and see what was the matter

but like a bold fellow, rode directly up to the poor man,
and with his pistol shot the wolf in the head that attacked
him.
It was happy for the poor man that it was my man

country, he had no fear upon him, but went close up to
him and shot him ; whereas, any other of us would have

and, indeed, it alarmed all our company, when, with the
noise of Friday’s pistol we heard on both sides the most
dismal howling of wolves ; and the noise, redoubled by the
echo of the mountains, appeared to us as if there had been
a prodigious number of them; and perhaps there was not
such a few as that we had no cause of apprehension ; how-
ever, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other that had

creature had bit him twice, once in the arm, and the other
time a little above his knee; and though he had made some
defense, he was just tumbling down by the disorder of his

which blinded us before, we saw clearly what had been the
case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though
we did not presentlv discern what kind of a creature it was

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we
came up to him he was helping him~off his horse, for the
man was both hurt and frightened, when on a suddeniwe
espied the bear come out of the wood ; and a monstrous
one it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw. \Ve were
all a little surprised when we saw him ; but when Friday
Saw him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow’s
countenance. “ Oh, oh, oh l " says Friday, three times,
pointing to him. “Oh, master !. you give me te leave, me
shakee te hand with him ; me makee you good laugh.”
Iwas surprised to see the fellow so well pleased. “ You
fool,’_’ says I, “he will eat you up." “ Eatee me up 1

him up ; me makee you good laugh ; you all stay here; me

boots in a moment, and puts on a pair of pumps (as we

pocket), gives my other servant his horse, and with his
gun away he flew, swift like the wind.
The hear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle
with nobody, till Friday, coming pretty near, calls to him,
as if the bear could understand him : “ Hark ye, hark ye,”
says Friday ; “ me speakee with you.” We followed at a
distance, for now being down on the Gascony side of the
mountains, we were entered a vast forest, where the coun-
try was plain and pretty open, though it had many trees in
it scattered here and there. Friday, who had, as we say,
the heels of the bear, came up with him quickly, and took
up a great stone, and threw it at him, and hit him just on
the head, but did him no more harm than if he had thrown
it against a wall ; but it answered Friday’s end, for the
rogue was so void of fear that he did it purely to make the
bear follow him and show us some laugh, as he called it.
As soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw him, he turns
about and comes after him, taking very long strides, and
shuffling on at a strange rate, so as would have put a horse
to a middling gallop; away runs Friday, and takes his
course as if he ran toward us for help ; so we all resolved

he was going about his own business another way ; and

especially I was angry that he had turned the bear upon
us, and then ran away; and I called out, “You dog! is
this your making us laugh ? Come away, and take your ‘
horse, that we may shcot the creature." He heard me,
and cried out, “ No shoot, no shoot; stand still, and you
get much laugh:" and as the nimble creature ran two feet
for the bear's one, he turned on a sudden on one side of

up the tree, laying his gun down upon the ground, at

but let it he and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing
like a cat, though so monstrous heavy. I was amazed at
the folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could not for
my life see anything to laugh at, till seeing the bear ge't
up the tree, We all rode near to him. ‘
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out
to the small end of a large branch, and the bear got
about half-way to him. , As soon as the bear got out to
that part where the limb of the tree was weaker—~“ Ha l”
says he to us, “ now you see me teachee the bear dance ;"
so he began jumping and shaking the bough, at which
the bear began to totter, but stood still, and began to
look behind him to see how he should get back; then,
indeed, we did laugh heartily; , But Friday had not
done with him by a great deal ; when, seeing him stand
still, he called out to him again, as if be supposed the
bear could speak English, " What, you come no further .7
pray you come further ;” so he left jumping and shaking
the tree ; and the bear, just as if he understood what he
said, did come a little further; then he began jumping
again, and the bear. stopped again. .We thought now
was a good time to knock him in' the head, and called to
Friday to stand still and we should shoot the bear; but
he cried out earnestly, “ Oh,- pray! oh, pray! no shoot;
me shoot by and then ;” he would have said by and by.
However, to shorten the story, Friday danced so much, ~
and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had laugh-
ing enough, but still could not imagine what the

upon shaking the bear off; and we found the bear was
too cunning for that too ; for he would not go out
far enough to be thrown down, but clung fast with his
great broad claws and feet, so that we could not imagine
what would be the end of it, and what the jest would be
‘ at last. But Friday put us out of doubt quickly : for see-
ing the bear cling fast to the bough,and that he would not
be persuaded to come any further, “Well, well,” says
Friday, “you no come further, me go; you no come to
me, me come to you ;” and upon this he went out to the
smaller end of the bough, where it would bend with his
weight, and gently let himself down by it, sliding down the
bough till he came near enough to jump down on his feet,
and away he ran to his gun, took it up, and stood still.
“Well,” said I to him, “Friday, what will you do now?
Why don't you shoot him?” “No shoot,” says Friday,
“ not yet; me shoot now, me no kill; me stay, give you one
more‘laugh :” and, indeed, so he did; for when the bear
saw his enemy gone, he came back from the bough where
he stood, but did it very cautiously, looking behind him
every step, and coming backward till he got into the body
of the tree; then, with the same hinder end foremost, he
came down the tree, grAsping it with his claws, and mov-
ing one foot at a time, very leisurely. At this juncture,
and just before he could set his hind foot on the ground,
Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle of
his piece in his ear and shot him dead. Then the rogue
turned about to see if we did not laugh ; and when he saw
we were pleased by our looks, he began to laugh very loud.
“ So we kill bear in my country," says Friday. “ So you
kill them?” says I; “why, you have no guns.” “No,”
says he, “no gun, but shoot great much long arrow.”
This was a good diversion to us; but we were still in a wild
place, and our guide very much hurt, and what to do we
hardly knew ; the bowling of wolves ran much in my head ;
and, indeed, except the noise I once heard on the shore of
Africa, of which I have said something already, I never

These things, and the approach of night, called us on,
or else, as Friday would have had us, we should certainly
have taken the skin of this monstrous creature off, which
was worth saving ; but we had near three leagues to go, i
and our guide hastened us; so we left him, and went ‘
forward on our journev. ‘ I
The ground was still covered with snow, though not
so deep and dangerous as on the mountains; and the
ravenous creatures, as we heard afterward, were come
down into the forest and plain country, pressed by hun-
ger, to seek for food, and had done a great deal of mis-
chief in the villages, where they surprised the country
people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses,
and some people, too. 7 We had one dangerous place to 7

bid us keep in a ready posture, for he believed there
were more wolves a-coming. We kept our arms ready,
and our eyes about us; but we saw no more wolves till

of. We had not gone half over the plain when we be-

and away they went to the woods. This gave us leisure
to charge our pieces again; and that we might lose no
time, we kept going; but we had but little more than
loaded our fusees, and put ourselves in readiness, when
we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on our left,
only that it was further onward, the same way we were
to go. ‘
r- The night was coming on, and the light began to be
dusky, which made it worse on our side; but the noise
increasing, we could easily perceive that. it was the howl-
ing and yelling of those hellish creatures; and, on a sud-
den, we perceived three troops of wolves, one on our
left, one behind 'us,‘and one in our front, so that we
seemed to be surrounded with them: however, as they
did not fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as
we could make Our horses go, which, the Way being very
rough, was only a good, hard trot. In this manner, we
came in view of the entrance Of a Wood, through which
we were to pass, at the further side of the plain ; but we
were greatly surprised, when coming nearer the lane orv
pass, we saw a confused number of wolves standing just )
at the entrance. On a sudden, at another opening of,
the wood, we heard the noise of a gun, and looking that;
way, out rushed a horse, with a saddle and bridle on

wolves after him, full speed: the horse had the advan-

hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they would get
up with him at last : no question but they di . '
But here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up
to the entrance where the horse came out, we found the
, carcases of another horse and of two men, devoured by
the ravenous creatures; and one of the men was no

take ; but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gath-
ered about us presently, in hopes of prey; and I ,verily
believe there were three hundred of them. It happened,
very much to our advantage, that at the entrance into
the wood, but a little way from it, there lay some large
timber-trees, which had been cut down the summer be-
fore, and I suppose lay there for carriage. I drew my
little troop in among those trees, and placing ourselves
in a line behind one long tree, I advised them all to
alight, and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork,
to stand in a triangle, or three fronts, inclosipg our
_ horses in the center. We did so, and it was well we did; g
‘for never was a more furious charge than the creatures
made upon us in this place. They came on with a
growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber,
which, as I said, was our breastwork, as if they were only
rushing upon their prey; and this fury of theirs, it seems,
was principally occasioned by their seeing our horses be-

they came on again. I was loath to spend our shot too
hastily; so I called my servant, not my man Friday, for
he was better employed, for, with the greatest dexterity
imaginable, he had charged my fusee and his own while'
we were engaged—but, as I said, I called my other man,
and giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a train
allalong the piece of timber, and let if be a large train.
He did so, and had but just time to get away, when the
wolves came up to it, and some got upon it; when I,

now very near dark—made more terr'ble, that they drew

again, for we had still near a league to go. We heard
the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we
went several times, and sometimes we fancied we saw
some of them ; but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were
not certain. In about an hour more we came to the
town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terri-
ble fright and all in arms ;' for, it seems, the night before
the wolves and some bears had broken into the village,
and put them in'such terror, that they were obliged to
keep guard night and day, but especially in the night, to
preserve their cattle, and indeed their people. A
The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs ‘
swelled so much with the rankling of his two wounds,
that he could go no further ; so we were obliged to take
a new guide, and go to Toulouse, where we found a
warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant country, and no snow,
no wolves, nor anything like them; but when we told our
story at Toulouse, they told us it was nothing but what
was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the mount-
ains, especially when the snow lay on the ground; but
they inquired much what kind of guide we had got who
would venture to bring us that way in such a severe
season, and told us it was surprising we' were not all
devoured. When we told them how we placed ourselves
and the horses in the middle,~they blamed us exceedingly,

stroyed, for it was the sight of the horses which made
the wolves so furious, seeing their prey, and that at
other times they are really afraid of a gun—but being
excessively hungry, and raging on that account, the
eagerness to come at the horses had made them sense-
less of danger—and that if we had not by the continual

many in number. For my part, I was never so sensible
of danger in my life—for, seeing above three hundred
devils come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us,
and having nothing to shelter us or retreat to, I gave
myself over for lost; and, ash was, I believe I shall
never care to cross those mountains again; I think I
would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea,
though I was sure to meet with a storm once a week.
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my
passage through France—nothing but what other travel-
ers have given an account of with much more advantage
than I can. I traveled from Toulouse to Paris, and
4
without any considerable stay came to Calais, and landed
safe at Dover the 14th of January, after having had a
severe cold season to travel in.
I was. now come to the center of my travels, and had
in a little time all my new-discovered estate safe about
me, the bills of exchange which I brought with me hav-
ing been currently paid. I 1
My principal guide and privy-counselor was my good
ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the money I had
sent her, thought no pains too much nor care too great
to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely that I
was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects ; and, '
indeed, I was very happy from the beginning, and now
to the end, in the unspotted integrity of this good
gentlewoman. ' .
And now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation
in the Brazils, I wrote to my old friend at isbon, who
having offered it to the two merchants, the survivors of
my trustees, who lived in the Brazils, they accepted the
offer, and remitted thirty-three thousand pieces of eight
to a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon to pay for it.
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form
which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man,
who sent me the bills of exchange for thirty-two thous-
and eight hundred pieces of eight for the estate, reserv-
ing the payment of one hundred moidores a year to him

which the plantation was to make good as a rent charge.

and adventure—a life of Providence’s Checker-work, and
of a variety which the world will seldom be able toshow
the like of ; beginning foolishly, but closing much more
happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so much
to hope for. ‘
Any one would think that in this state of complicated
good fortune I was past running any more hazards—and
so, indeed, I had been, if other circumstances had con?
curred; but I was inured to a wandering life, had no
family, nor many relations; nor, however rich, had
contracted fresh acquaintance; and though I had. sold
my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not keep that coun-
try out of my head, and had a great mind to be upon
the wing again", especially I could not resist the strong
inclination I had to see my island, and to know if the
poor Spaniards were in being there. My true friend,
the widow/earnestly dissuaded me from it, and so far
prevailed with me, that for almost seven years she pre-
vented my running abroad, during which time I took .
my two nephews, the children of one of my brothers,
into my care ; the eldest, having something of his own,
I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of

trader to the East Indies; this was in the yean694.

which, at my coming, I found about twenty young children
on the island.
Here I stayed about twenty days—left them supplies
of all necessary things, and particularly of arms,
powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two workmen, which I

Besides this, I shared the lands into parts with themI
reserved to myself the property of the whole, but gave
them such parts respectively as they agreed on; and
having settled all things with them, and engaged them
not to leave the place, I left there.
From thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I
sent a bark, which I bought there, with more people to
the island ; and in itfbesides other supplies, I sent seven
women, being such as I found proper for service, or for
wives to such as would take them. As to the English-
men, I promised to send them some women from Eng-
land, with a good cargo of necessaries, if they would ap-
ply themselves to planting—which I afterward could not
perform. The fellows proved very honest and diligent’

in the fullness of all things ; grown old, and when, if
ever, it might be allowed me to have had experience of
every state of middle life, and to know which was most

all this, any one would have thought that the native pro-

ROBINSON cnftson. '27:
in my thoughts, should be worn out, and I might, at
sixty-one years of age, have been a little inclined to stay
at home, and have done venturing life and fortune any
more. .
Nay, further, the common motive of foreign adven-
tures was taken away in me, for I had no fortune to
make ; I had nothing to seek ; if I had gained ten thou-
sand pounds I had been no richer; for I had already
ROBINSON cnftson. '27:
what I had was visibly increasing; for, having no great
family, I could not spend the income of what I had, un-
less I would set up for an expensive way of living, such as
a great family, servants, equipage, gayety, and the like,
which were things I had no notion of, or inclination to ; so
that I had nothing, indeed,to do but to sit still, and fully
enjoy what I had got, and see it increase daily upon my
hands. Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at
least not enough to resist the ‘strong inclination I had to
go abroad again, which hung about me like a chronic dis-
temper. In particular, the desire of seeing my new
plantation in the island, and the colony 'I left there, ran
in my head continually. I dreamed of it all night, and
my imagination ran 'upon it all day; it was uppermost
in all my thoughts; and my fancy worked so steadily
and strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep ; in
short, nothing could remove it out of my mind ; it even
broke so violently into all my discourses that it made my
conversation tiresome, for I could talk of nothing else ; all
my discourse ran into it, even to impertinence; and I saw
it myself. .
I have often heard persons of good judgment say, that
all the stir that people make in the world about ghosts
and apparations is owing to the strength of imagination,
and the. pQWerful operation of fancy in their minds;
that there is no such thing as a spirit appearing,v or
a ghost Walking; that people’s poring affectionately
upon the past conversation of their deceased friends
so realizes it to them, that they are capable of fancy-
ing, upon some extraordinary circumstances, that they
see them, talk to them, and are answered by them,
when, in truth, there is nothing but shadow and vapor
in the thing, and they really know nothing of the
matter. 7 _
For my part, I know not to this hour whether there are
any such things as real apparitions, specters, or walking
of people after they are dead ; or whether there is any-
thing in the stories they tell us of that kind more than
the product of vapors, sick minds, and wandering fancies;
but this I know, that my imagination worked up to such
a height, had brought me into such excess of vapors, or
what else I may call it, that I actually supposed myself
often upOn the spot, at my old castle, behind the trees ;
saw my old Spaniard, Friday‘s father, and the reprobate
sailors I left upon the island; nay, I fancied Italked with
them, and looked at them steadily, though 1 was broad
awake, as at persons just before me ; and this I did till
I often frightened myself with the images my fancy
represented to me. One time, in my sleep, I had the

provisions they had laid up,.0n purpose to distress and
starVe them; -things that I had never heard of, and
that, indeed, were never all of them true in fact ; but it
was so warm in my imagination, and so realized to me,
that, to the hour I saw them, I could not be persuaded
but that it was orwould be true ; also how I resented it,
when the Spaniard complained to me; and how I brought
them to justice, tried them, and ordered them all three
to be hanged. What there was really in this shall be
seen in its place; for howeVer I came to form such things
in my dream, and what secret converse of spirits inject-
ed it, yet there was, I say, much of it true. I own that

true ; but the general part was so true—the base, villain-
ous behavior of these three hardened rogues was such,
and had been so much worse than all I can describe,
that the dream had too much similitude of the fact;
and as I would afterward have punished them severely,

But to return to my story: In this kind of temper I
lived some years; I had no enjoyment of my life, no,
pleasant hours, no agreeable diversion, but what had
something or other of this in it; so that my wife who
saw my mind wholly bent upon it, told me very seriously
one night, that she believed there" was some secret, POW?
erful impulse of Providence upon me, which had deter-
mined me to go thither again ; and that she found noth-
ing hindered me going but my being engaged to a wife
and children. * She told me that it was true she could
not think of parting with me: But as (she was assured

do; so, as it seemed to her that the thing was de-
termined above, she would not be the only obstruction;
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 273
found me very intent upon her words, and that I looked
very earnestly at her, so that it a little disordered her,
and she stopped. I asked her why she did not go on,
and say out what she was going to say. But I perceived
that her heart was too full, and that some tears .stood in
her eyes.] “Speak out, my dear,” said I: “are you
willing I should go ?” “ No,” says she, very' affection-
ately, “ I am far from willing ; but if you are resolved to
go," says she, “rather than I would be the only hinder-
ance, I will go with you; for though I think it a most
preposterous thing for one of your years, and in your
condition, yet, if it must be,” said she, again weeping, “I
would not leave you ; for if it be of Heaven you 'must do
it, there is no resisting it ; and if Heaven make it your
duty to go, He will also make it mine to go with you,
or otherwise dispose of me, that I may not obstruct
it." .
This affectionate behavior of my wife’s brought me a
r

little out of the vapors, and I began to consider what I
was doing; I corrected my wandering fancy, and began
to argue with myself sedately, what business I had after
threoscore years, and after such a life of tedious suf- '
ferings and disasters, and closed in so happy and easy
a manner; I say, what business had I to rush into new
274 ROBINSGN CRUSOE.
youth and poverty to run into ?
With those thoughts I considered my new engage-
ment; that I had a wife, one child born, and my wife
then great with child of another that I had all the world
could give me, and had no need to seek hazard for
gain ; that I was declining in years, and ought to think
rather of leaving what I had gained than of seeking
to increase it; that ,as to what my wife had said of its
being an impulse from Heaven, and that it should be
my duty to go, I had no notion of that ; so, after many
of these cogitations, I struggled with the power of my
imagination, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe peo-
ple may always db in like cases if they will. In a
word, I conquered it ; composed myself with such argu-
ments as occurred to my thoughts, and which my pres-
ent condition furnished me plentifully with; and par-
ticularly, as the most effectual method, I resolved to
divert myself with other things, and to engage in some
business that might effectually tie me up from any more
excursions of this kind; for I found that thing return

do, not anything of moment immediately before me.
To this purpose, I bought a little farm in the county of
Bedford, and resolved to remove myself thither. I had
a little convenient house upon it, and the land about it,
I found, was capable of great improvement, and was in
many ways suited to my inclination, which delighted in
cultivating, managing, planting, and improving of land ;
and particularly, being an inland country, I was removed
from conversing among sailors and things relating to
the remote parts of the world. I went down to my
farm, settled my family, bought plows, barrows, a
cart, wagon-horses, cows, and sheep, and', setting seri-
ously to work, became in one half year a mere country
gentleman. My thoughts were entirely taken up.in
managing mv servants, cultivating the ground, inclos-
ing, planting, etc; and I lived, as I thought, the most
agreeable life that nature was capable of directing, or
that a man always bred to misfortunes was capable of re-
treating to.
I farmed upon my own land; I had no rent to pay,
was limited by no articles; I could pull Up or cut
down as I pleased; what I planted was for myself,
and what I improved was for my family; and having
thus left off the thoughts of wandering, I had not
the least discomfort in any part of life as to this
world, Now I thought, indeed, that I enjoyed the
middle state of life which my father so earnestly recom-
mended to me, and lived a kind of heavenly life, some-
thing like what is described by the poet, upon the sub-
ject of a country life :
“ Free from vices, free from care,
Age has no pain, and youth no snare."
' But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from un-
seen Providence unhinged me at once; and not only made
a breach upon me inevitable and incurable, but drove me
by its consequences, into a deep relapse of the wander-
ing disposition, which, as I may say, being born in_my
very blood, soon recovered its hold of me; and, like the
returns of a violent distemper, came on with an irresist-
ible force uppn me. This blow was the loss of my wife.
It is not my business here to write an elegy upon my
wife, give a character of her particular virtues, and make
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 275
She was in few words, the stay of all my affairs; the cen-
ter of all my enterprises; the engine that, by her pru-

head, and did more to guide my rambling genius than a
mother’s tears, a father’s instructions, a friend’s counsel,
or all my own reasoning powers could do. I was happy
in listening to her, and in being moved by her entreaties;
and to the last degree desolate and dislocated in the
world by the loss of her.
When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly
round me. I was as much a stranger in it, in

them; for the men of pleasure every day surfeited of
their vice, and heaped up work for sorrow and repent-
ance : and the men of labor spent their strength in daily
struggling for bread to maintain the vital strength they
labored with: so livin in a daily circulation of sorrow,
living but to Work, an working but to live, as if daily
bread were the only end of wearisome life, and a weari-
some life the only occasion of daily bread. ' '
This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom,
the island ; where I suffered no more corn to grow, be-
cause I did not want it; and bred no more goats, because
I had no more use for them; where the money lay in the
drawer till it grew moldy, and had scarce the favor to be
looked upon in twenty years. All these things, had I
improved them as I ought to have done, and as reason
and religion had dictated to me, would have taught me
to search further than human enjoyments for a full
felicity; and that there was something which certainly
was the reason and end of life superior to all these
things, and which was either to be possessed, or at least
hoped for, on this side of the grave.
. But my sage counselor was gone; I was like a ship
without a pilot, that could only run afore the wind. My
thoughts ran all away again into the old affair ; my head
was quite turned with the whimsies of foreign adven-
tures ; and all the pleasant, innocent amusements of my
farm, my garden, my cattle, and my family, which before
entirely possessed me, were nothing to me, had no relish, ‘
and were like music to one that has no car, or food to
one that has no taste. In a word, I resolved to leave
off housekeeping, let my farm, and return to London;
and in a few months after I did so.
When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I
was before; I had no relish for the place, no employment
in it, nothing to_ do but to saunter about like an idle
person, of whom it may be said he is perfectly useless in
God’s creation, and it is not one farthing’s matter to the
rest of his kind whether he be dead or alive. This also
was the thing which, of all circumstances of life, was the
most my aversion, who had been all my days used to an
active life; and I would often say to myself, “ A state of
idleness is the dregs of life;" and, indeed, I thought I
was much more suitably employed when I was twenty-
six days making a deal board.
» It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my
nephew, whom, as I have observed before, I had brought
up to the sea, and had made him commander of a ship,
was come home from a short voyage to Bilboa, being the
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 271
some merchants of his acquaintance had been proposing
to him to go a voyage for them to the East Indies, and to.
China, as private traders. “ And now, uncle," says he,
“if you will go to sea with me, I will engage to land you
upon your old habitation in the island; for we are to
touch at the Brazils.”
Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future
state, and of the existence of an invisible world, than the
concurrence of second causes with the idea of things
which we form in our minds, perfectly reserved, and not
communicated to any in the world.
My nephew knew nothing how far, my distemper of
wandering was returned upon me, and I knew nothing of
what he had in his thought to say, when that very morn~
ing, before he came to me, I had, in a great deal of con-
fusion of thought, and revolving every part of my cir-
cumstances in my mind, come to this resolution, that I
would go to Lisbon, and consult with my old sea captain;
and if it was rational and practicable, I would go and
see the island again, and what was become of my people
there. ‘I had pleased myself with the thoughts of peo-
pling the place, and carrying inhabitants from hence,
getting a patent for the possession, and I know not what;
when, in the middle of all this, in comes my nephew, as
I have said, with his project of carrying me thither in
his way to the East Indies.
I paused awhile at his words, and looking steadily at
him, “What devil,” said I, “sent you on this unlucky
errand P” My nephew stared as if he had been fright-
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 271
pleased at the proposal, he recoved himself. “ I hope it
may not be an unlucky proposal, sir,” says he. “ I dare
\
say you would be pleased to see your new colony there,
where you once reigned with more felicity tnan most of
your brother monarchs in the world.” In a word, the
scheme hit so exactly with my temper, that is to say, the
prepossession I was under, and of which I have said so
much, that I told him, in a few words, if he agreed with
the merchants, I would go with him; but I told him I
' would not promise to go any further than my own island.
“Why, sir," says he, “you don't want to be left there
again, I hope P" “But,” said I, “ can you not take me
up'again on your return P" He told me it would not be
possible to do so; that the merchants would never allow
him to come that way with a laden ship of such value, it
being a month’s sail out of his way, and might be three
or four. “Besides, sir, if I should miscarry," said he,
“and not return at all, then you would be just reduced
to the condition you were in before."
This was very rational ; but we both found out a tem-
edy for it ; which was, to carry a framed sloop on board
the ship, which being taken in pieces, might by the help
of some carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with us,

sea in a few days. I was not long resolving; for indeed,
the importunities of my nephew joined so effectually
with my inclination, that nothing could oppose me; on
the other hand, my wife being dead, none concerned
themselves so much for me as to persuade me one way
or the other, except my ancient good friend the widow,
who earnestly struggled with me to consider my years,
my easy circumstances, and the needless hazards of a ,
long voyage ; and above all, my young children. But it
was all to no purpose; I had an irresistible desire for the
voyage; and I told her I thought there was somethin
so uncommon in the impressions I had upon my mind,
that it would be a kind of resisting Providence if I
should attempt to stay at home ; after which she ceased
her expostulations, and joined with me, not only in
making provision for my voyage, but also in settling my
my family affairs for my absence, and providing for the
education of my children. In order to do this, I made
my will, and settled the estate I had in such a manner
for my children, and placed in such hands, that I was

nance to herself for her care, all which she richly de-
served; for no mother could have taken more care in
their education, or understood it better; and as she lived
till I came home, I also lived to thank her for it.
My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of
January 1694—5; and I, with my man Friday, went on
board, in the Downs, the 8th; having, besides that sloop
which I mentioned above, a very considerable cargo of
all kinds of necessary things for my colony ; which, if I
ROBINSON causes. 279
First, I carried with me some servants whom I pur-
posed to place there as inhabitants, or at least to set on
work there upon my account, while I stayed, and either
to leave them there or carry them forward, as they should
appear willing; particularly, I carried two carpenters, a
smith, and a very handy, ingenious fellow, who was a
cooper by trade, and was also a general mechanic; for
he was dexterous at making wheels and hand-mills to
grind corn, was a good turner and a good pot-maker;
he also made anything that was proper to make of earth
or of wood: in a word, we called him our Jack-of-all-
trades. With these I carried a tailor, who had offered
himself to go a passenger t0 the East Indies with my
nephew, but afterward consented to stay on our new
plantation, and who proved a most necessary handy tel-
low as could be desired in many other businesses besides
that of his trade ; for, as I observed formerly, necessity

and enough of them, as by my calculation, might com-
fortably supply ’them for seven years; if I remember
right, the materials I carried for clothing them, with
gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as they
could want for wearing, amounted to above two hundred
pounds, including some beds, bedding, and household

pewter, brass, etc.; and near a hundred pounds more in
iron work, nails, tools of every kind, staples, hooks,
hinges, and every necessary thing I could think of. ‘
I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and
fusees; besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of
shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead, and two
pieces of brass cannon; and, because I knew not what
time and What extremities I was providing for, I carried
a hundred barrels of powder, besides swords, cutlasses,
and the iron part of some pikes and halberts. In short,
we had a large magazine of all sorts of store; and I
made my nephew carry two small quarter-deck guns
more than he wanted for his ship, to leave behind if
there was occasion; so that when he came there we
might build a fort and man it against all sorts of ene~

we were obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where
we lay wind-bound two-and-twenty days; but we had

About eight o’clock in the morning we discOvered the
ship’s boats by the help of our perspective glasses, and
found there were two of them, both thronged with peo-

the wind being against them; that they saw our ship, and
did their utmost to make us see them. We immediately
spread our ancient, to let them know we saw them, and
hung a waft out, as a signal for them to come on

afterward getting in between the timbers, and within the

They had no more to do then but to get into their

them in all these cases, such as storms, to overset and

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures,

he would ; and, with a great deal of seriousness and

though others were for a time out of all government of
themselves.
I can not help committing this to writing, as perhaps it
may be useful to those into whose hands it may fall, for
guiding themselves in the extravagances of their passions ; ‘
for if an excess of joy can carry men out to such a
length beyond the reach of their reason, what will not

had retired to lodgings provided for them as well as our
ship would allow, and had slept heartily—as most of them
did, being fatigued and frightened—they were quite an-

manners, or civil acknowledgments for the kindness \
shown them was wanting; the French, it is known, are]
naturally apt enough to exceed that way. The captain,

word, and to consider what to do with them afterward;
but I overruled him in that part, for I knew what it was
to be set on shore in a strange country ; and if the Portu-
guese captain that took me up at sea had served me so,
and taken all I had for my deliverance, I must have been
starved, or have been as much a slave at the Brazils as I
had been at Barbary, the mere being sold to a Mohamme-
dan excepted ; and perhaps a Portuguese is not a much
better master than a Turk, if not in some cases much
worse. -
I therefore told the French captain that we had taken
them up in their distress, it was true, but that it was our
duty to do so, as we were fellow-creatures ; and we would
desire to be so delivered if we were in the like or any other
extremity ; that we had done nothing for them but what
we believed they would have done for us if we had beenin
their case and they in ours ; but that we took them up to
save them, not to plunder them ; and it would be a most
barbarous thing to take that little from them which they

East Indies ; and though we were driven out of our
course to the westward a very great way, and perhaps were
directed by Heaven on purpose for their deliverance, yet it
was impossible for us willfully to change our voyage on
their particular account ; nor could my nephew, the cap-
tain, answer it to the freighters, with whom he was under
charter to pursue his voyage by way of Brazil; and all
I knew we could do for them was to put ourselves in the
way of meeting with other ships homeward bound from
the West Indies, and get them a passage, if possible, to
England or France.

they could not but be very thankful for it ;‘ but they were
in very great consternation, especially the. passengers, at
the notion of being carried away to the East Indies ; they
then entreated me that as I was driven so far to the west-
ward before I met with them, I would at least keep on
the same conrse to the Banks of Newfoundland, where it
was probable I might meet with some ship or sloop that
they might hire to carry them back to Canada.
I‘thought this was but a reasonable request on their
part, and therefore I inclined to agree to it ; for indeed I
considered that to carry this whole company to the East
Indies would not only be an intolerable severity upon the
poor people, but would be ruining our whole voyage Hy de-
vouring all our provisions; so I thought it no breach of
charter-party, but what an unforseen accident made abso-
lutely necessary to us, and in which no one could say we
were to blame; for the laws of God and nature would
forbid that we should refuse to take up two boats full of
people in such a distressed condition ;and the nature of
the thing, as well respecting ourselves as the poor people,
obliged us to set them on shore somewhere or other for
their deliverance. So I consented that we would carry
them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would permit;
and if not, I would carry them to Martinico, in the West
Indies. '
The wind continued fresh easterly, but the Weather
pretty good ; and as the winds had continued in the points
between and S.E. a long time, we missed several op-
portunities of sending them to France, for we met several
ships bound to Europe, whereof two were French, from
St. Christopher’s, but they had been so long beating up
against the wind that they durst take in no passengers, for
fear of wanting provisions for the voyage, as well for them-
selves as for those they should take in; so we were obliged
to go on. It was about a week after this that we made the
Banks of Newfoundland ; where, to shorten my story, we
put all our French people On board a bark, which they
hired at sea there, to put them on shore, and afterward to
carry them to France, if they could get provisions to
victual themselves with. When I say all the French went _
on shore, I should remember that the young priest I spoke
of, hearing we were bound to the East ’Indies, desired to
go on the voyage with us. and to be set on shore on the
coast of Coromandel; which I readily agreed to, for I
wonderfully liked the man, and had very good reason,
as will appear afterward; also four of the seamen en-
tered themselves on our ship, and proved very useful
fellows.
From hence we directed our course for the West Indies,
steering away S. and S. by E. for about twenty days to-
gether, sometimes little or no wind at all ; when we met
with another subject for'our humanity to work upon“

fresh gale, and we soon came to speak with her. We found
her a ship of Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, but had
been blown out of the road at Barbadoes a few days be-
fore she was ready to sail, by a terrible hurricane, while I

which had blown them quite out of their knowledge to

told us they expected to have seen the Bahama Islands,

strong gale of wind at N. N. W,, the .same that blew
now; and having no sails to work the ship with but a
main course, and a kind of square sail upon a jury
foremast, which they had set up, they could not lie near
the wind, but were endeavoring to stand away for the
Canaries.
But that which was worst of all was that they were

all devoured ; and they had seven casks of rum. There
was a ,youth, and his mother, and a maid-servant on
board, who were passengers, and thinking the Ship was
ready to sail, unhappily came on board the evening
before the hurricane began; and having no provisions
of their own left, they were in a more deplorable con-
dition than the rest: for the seamen, being reduced to
such an extreme necessity themselves, had no compassion,
we may be sure, for the poor passengers ; and they were,
indeed, in such a condition that their misery is very hard
to describe.
I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had
not led me (the weather being fair, and the wind abated)
to go on board the ship. The second mate, who upon
this occasion commanded the ship, had been on board
our ship, and he told ,me they had three passengers in
the great cabin that were in a deplorable condition.
“Nay,” says he, “I believe they are dead, for I have
heard nothing of them for above two days; and I was
afraid to inquire after them," said he, “for I had noth-
ing to relieve them with." We immediately applied
ourselves to give them what relief we could spare; and,
indeed, I had so far overruled things with my nephew,
that I would have victualed them, though we had gone
away to Virginia, or any other part of the coast of America,
to have supplied ourselves; but there was no necessity
for that.
But now they were in a new danger; for they were
afraid of eating too much, even of that little we gave
them. The mate, or commander, brought six men with
him in his boat;_ but these poor wretches looked like
skeletons, and were so weak that they could hardly sit to
their oars. The mate himself was very ill, and half-starved;
for he declared he had reserved nothing from the men,
and went share and share alike with them in every bit they
eat. I cautioned him to eat sparingly, and set meat before
him immediately, but he had not eaten three mouthfuls be-
fore he began to be sick and out of order ; so he stopped
awhile, and our surgeon mixed him up something with
some broth, which he said would be to him both food and
physic; and after he had taken it he grew better. In
the meantime I forgot not the men. I ordered victuals
to be given them, and the poor creatures rather de-
voured than eat it; they were vso exceedingly hungry
that they were in a manner ravenous, and had no com-
mand of themselves ; and two of them eat with so much
greediness that they were in danger of their lives the
next morning. The sight of these people’s distress was
very moving to me, and brought to mind what 1 had a

island, where I had not the least mouthful of food, or
any prospect of procuring any; besides the hourly ap-
prehensions I had of being made the food of other crea-
tures. But allythe while the mate was thus relating to
me the miserable condition of the ship’s company, I could
not put out of my thought the story he had told me
of the three poor creatures in the great cabin—viz., the
mother, her son, and the maid-servant, whom he had heard
nothing of for two or three days, and whom,he seemed to
confess, they had wholly neglected, their own extremities
being so great ; by which I understood that they had
really given them no food at all, and that therefore they
must be perished, and be all lying dead, perhaps, on the
floor or deck of the cabin.
As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called cap-
tain, on board with his men, to refresh them, so I also for-
got not the starving crew that were left on board, but
ordered my own boat to go on board the ship, and, with,
‘ my mate and twelve men, to carry them a sack of bread,

charged the men to cause the meat to be boiled while they
stayed, and to keep guard in [the cook-room, to pre-
vent the men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of
the pet before it was well boiled, and then to give every
man but a very little at a time; and by this caution he pre-
served the men, who would otherwise have killed them-_
selves with that very food that was given them on purpose
to save their lives. 7
At the same time I ordered the mate to go into the great
cabin, and see what condition the poor passengers were in;
and if they were alive, to comfort them, and give them
what refreshment was proper : and the surgeon gave him
a large pitcher, with some of the prepared broth which he
had given the mate that was on board, and which hp did
not question would restore them gradually. I was not

to See the scene of misery which I knew the ship itself Would
present me with, in a more lively manner than I could have
it by report,- I took the captain of the ship, as we now
called him, with me, and Went myself, a little after, in their
boat.
I found the poor men oh board almost in a tymult to
get the victuals out of the boiler before it was ready ; but
my mate observed his orders, and kept a good guard at
the cook-room door ; and the man he placed there, after
using all possible persuasion to have patience, kept them
off by force ; however, he caused some biscuit cakes to be
dipped in the pot, and softened with the liquor of the
meat, which they call brewis, and gave them every
one some to stay their stomachs, and told them it Was
for their own safety that he was obliged to giVe them
but little at a time. But it was all in_vain; and had

were lashed fast, and her head sunk between her shoulders
_ like a corpse, though not quite dead. My mate said all he
could to revive and encourage her, and with a spoon put
some broth into her mouth. »She opened her lips, and
lifted up one hand, but could not speak: yet she under-
stood What he said, and made signs to him, intimating
that it was too late for her, but pointed to her child, as if
she would have said they should take care of him. How-
ever, the mate, who was exceedingly moved at the sight,
endeavored to get some of the broth into her mouth, and,
as he said, got two or three spoonfuls down—though I
question whether he could be sure of it or not : but it was
too late, and she died the same night.
The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most
affectionate mother’s life, was not so far gone ; yet he lay
in a cabin bed, as one stretched out, with hardly any life
left in him. He had a piece of an old glove in his mouth,
having eaten up the rest of it; however, being' young, and
having more strength than his mother, the mate got some-
thing down his throat, and he began sensibly to revive;
though by giving him, some time after, but two or three
spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and brought“ it
up again.
But the next care was the poor maid : she lay all along
upon the deck, hard by her mistress, and just like one

clasped round the frame of the chair, and she gripped it
so hard that we could not easily make her let it go ; her
other arm lay over her head, and her feet lay both together,
set fast a ainst the frame of the cabin table : in short, she
lay just 11 e one in the agonies of death, and yet she was
alive, too. \ The poor creature was not only starved with

could spare; and taking three casks of sugar, some rum,
and some pieces of eight from them for satisfaction, we
left them, taking on board with us, at their own earnest
request, the youth and the maid, and all their goods.
The young lad was about seventeen years of age, a’
pretty, well-bred, modest, and sensible youth, greatly de-
jected with the loss of his mother, and also at having lost
his father but a few months before, at Barbadoes. He
begged of the surgeon to speak to me to take him out of
the ship; for he said the cruel fellows had murdered his
mother: and, indeed, so they had, that is to say, passively:
for they might have spared a small sustenance to the poor
helpless widow, though it had been "but just enough to
keep her alive; but hunger knows no friend, no relation,
no justice, no right, and therefore is remorseless, and
capable of no compassion.
The surgeon told him how far we were going, and that
it would carry him away from all his friends, and put him,
perhaps, in as bad circumstances almost as those we found
him in—that is to say, starving in the world. He said it
mattered not whither he went, if he was but delivered
from the terrible crew that he was among; that the cap-
tain (by which he meant me, for he could know nothing
of my nephew) had saved his life, and he was sure would
not hurt him; and as for the maid, he was sure, if she
came to herself, she would be very thankful for it,
and let us carry them where we would. The surgeom
represented the case so effectually to me that I yielded,
and we took them both on board, with all their goods, ex-
cept eleven hogsheads of sugar, which could not be re-
moved or come at; and as the youth had a bill of lading
for them, I made his commander sign a writing, obliging
himself to go, as soon as he came to Bristol, to one Mr.
Rogers, a merchant there, to whom the youth said he was
related, and to deliver a letter which I wrote to him, and
all the goods he had belonging to the deceased widow;
which. I suppose, was not done, for I could never learn
that the ship came to Bristol, but was, as is most probable,

shall observe that I came to my old habitation, the island,

that I found the place; for as I came to it and went
to it before on the south and east side of the island, com-
ing from the Brazils, so now, coming in between the main
and the island, and having no chart for the coast, nor any
landmark, I did not know it when I saw it, or know
whether I saw it or not. We heat about a great while,
and went on shore on several islands in the mouth of the
great river Oronooque, but none for my purpose; only this
I learned by my coasting the shore, that I was under one
great mistake before—viz., that the continent which I
thought I saw from the island I lived in was really no con-
tinent, but a long island, or rather a ridge of islands,
reaching from one to the other side of the extended
mouth of that great river; and that the savages who came
to my island were not properly those which we call Carib-
bees, but islanders, and other barbarians of the same
kind, who inhabited nearer to our side than the rest.
In short, I visited several of these islands to no purpose;
some I found were inhabited, and some were not ; on one
of them I found some Spaniards, and thought they had
lived there; but speaking with them, found they had a

they were in it was impossible to guess what nation they
were of ; but he made all clear, both to them and to me.
First, he turned to me, and pointing to them, said, “ These,
sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to you ;"
and then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them
know who I was ; upon which they all came up, one by one,
not as if they had been sailors, and ordinary fellows, and the
like, but really as if they had been ambassadors or noble-
men, and I a monarch or great conqueror; their behavior
was to thelast degree, obliging and courteous, and yet mixed
with a manly, majestic gravity, which very well became them;
and, in short, they had so much more manners than I, that I
scarce knew how to receive their civilities, much less how to
return them in kind.
The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the island,

after my going away, is so very remarkable, and has so
many incidents, which the former part of my relations will
help to understand, and which Will, in most of the PattiCu-

not but commit them, with great delight, to the reading of

next morning. It seems they wanted notime to get them-
selves ready ; for they had neither clothes, nor provisions,
nor anything in the world ‘but what they had on them,
and a few roots to eat, of which they used to make their
bread. They were in all three weeks absent ; and in thatv
time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered for
my escape, as I mentioned in the other part, and to get
off from the island,_leaving three of the most impudent,
hardened, ungoverned, disagreeable villains behind me
that any man could desire to meet with—to the poor
Spaniards’ great grief and disappointment.
The only just thing the rogues did was, that when the
Spaniards came ashore, they gave my letter to them, and
gave them provisions, and other relief, as I had ordered
them to do; also they gave them the long paper of direc-
tions which I had left with them, containing the particular
methods which I took for managing every part of my life
there; the way I baked my bread, bred up tame goats,
and planted my corn ; how I cured my grapes, made my
pots, and, in a word, everything I did. All this being
written down, they gave to the Spaniards (two of them
understood English well enough): nor did they refuse to
accommodate the Spaniards with anything else, for they
agreed very well for some time. They gave them an
equal admission into the house or cave, and they began
to live very sociably ; and the head Spaniard, who had
seen pretty much of my methods, together with F riday's
father, managed all their affairs ; but as for the English-
l
men, they did nothing but ramble about the island, shoot
parrots, and catch tortoises; and when they came home at
night, the Spaniards provided their suppers for them.

relation of it came from the Spaniards themselves, whom
I may call the accusers, yet when I came to‘ examine the
fellows they could not deny a word of it.
But before I come to the particulars of this part, I must
supply a defect in my former relation; and this was, I for-
got to set down among the rest, that just as we were
weighing the anchor to set sail, there happened a little
quarrel on board of our ship, which I was once afraid
would have turned to a second mutiny; nor was it ap—
peased till the captain, rousing up his courage, and taking
us all to his assistance, parted them by force, and making
two of the most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them
in irons: and as they had been active in the former dis~
orders, and let fall some ugly, dangerous words the second
time, he threatened to carry them in irons to England,
and have them hanged there for mutiny and running away
with the ship. This, it seems, though the captain did not
intend to do it, frightened some other men in the ship;
and some of them had put it into the head ofvthe rest that
the captain only gave them good words for the present,
till they should come to some English port, and that then
they should be all put into jail, and tried for their lives.
The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us with
it, upon which it was desired that I, who still passed for a
great man among them, should go down with the mate
and satisfy the men, and tell them that they might vbe as-
sured, if they behaved well the rest'of the voyage, all they
had done for the time past should be pardoned. So I
went, and after passing my honor's word to them they
appeared easy, and the more so when I caused the two
men that were in irons to be released and forgiven.
But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for the
night; the wind also falling calm next morning, we found,
, that our two men, who had been laid in irons, had stolen
each of them a musket and some other weapons (what
powder or shot they had we knew not), and had taken the
ship’s pinnace, whichwas not yet hauled up, and run away
with her to their companions in roguery on shore. As
soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat on shore,
with twelve men and the mate, and away they went to seek

boat coming on shore. The mate was once resolved, in
justice to their roguery, to have destroyed their planta-
tions, burned all their household stuff and furniture, and
left them to shift without it ; but having no orders, he let
it all alone, left everything as he found it, and bringing
the pinnace away, came on board without them. These
‘ ROBINSON CRUSOE. 303
lains were much more wicked than they, that after they
had been two or three days together they turned the two
new-comers out-of-doors to shift- for themselves, and would
have nothing to do with them ; nor could they for a good
while be persuaded to give them any food; as for the
Spaniards, they were not yet come.

the three English brutes to have taken in their country-

pitched their tents on the north shore of the island, but a
little more to the west, to be out of danger of the savages,
who always landed on the east parts of the island. Here
they built them two huts, one to lodge in and the other to
lay up their magazines and stores in ; and the Spaniards
having given them some corn for seed,and some of the

They were going on in this little thriving position when
the three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen, too, in
mere humor, and to insult them, came and bullied them,
and told them the island was theirs: that the governor,
meaning me, had given them the possessionof it, and no-
body else had any right to it ; and that they should build
no houses upon their ground unless they would pay rent
for them. The two men,thinking they were jesting at

they were the ground landlords, he hoped if they built
tenements upon their land, and made improvements, they
would, according to the custom of landlords, grant a long
lease : and-desired they would get a scrivener to draw the
writings. One of the three, cursing and raging, told them

they resolved to go to the castle (as they called my old
dwelling), where the three rogues and the Spaniards all
lived together at that time, intending to have a fair battle,
and the Spaniards should stand by to see fair play; so they
got up in the morning before day, and came to the
place, and called the Englishmen by their names, tell-
ing a Spaniard that answered that they wanted to speak
with them.
It happened that the day before two of the Spaniards,
having beenin the woods, had seen one of the two English-
men, whom, for distinction, I called the honest men, and
he had made a sad complaint to the Spaniards of the bar-
barous usage they had met with from their three country-
men, and how they had ruined their plantation, and de-v

stroyed their corn, that they had labored so hard to bring
forward, and killed the milch-goat and their three kids,
which was all they had provided for their sustenance, and
that if he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not
assist them again, they should be starved. When the
Spaniards came home at night, and they were all.at sup-
per, one of them took the freedom to reprove the three
Englishmen, though in very gentle and mannerly terms,
and asked them how they could be so cruel, they being
harmless, inoffensive fellows; that they were putting them-
selves in a way to subsist by their labor, and that it had
,cost them a great deal of pains to bring things to such
perfection as they were then in.
One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, “What
had they to do-there? that they came on shore without
leave ; and that they should not plant or build upon the
island; it was/none of their ground." “Why,” says the
Spaniard, very calmly, “ Senor Inglese, they must not
starve.” The Englishman replied, like a rough tarpaulin,
“ They might starve; they should not plant nor build in
that place.” “ But what must they do then, senor ?" said
the Spaniard. Another of the brutes returned, “ Do?
they should be servants, and work for them." “ But
how can you expect that of them P" says the Spaniard;
“ they are not bought with your money; you have no right
to make them servants." The Englishmen answered,
“The island was theirs; the governor had given- it to
them, and no man had anything to do there but them-
selves;"and with that he swore that he would go and burn
all their new huts; they should build none upon their land.
“Why, senor,” says the Spaniard, “by the same rule, we
must be your servants, too.” “Ay,” returned the bold
dog, “and so you shall, too, before we have done with
you;" mixing two or three oaths in the proper intervals
of his speech. The Spaniard only smiled at that, and
made him no answer. However, this little discourse had
heated them ; and starting up, one says to the other (I
think it was be they called Will Atkins), “Come, Jack,
let's go and have t'other brush with them ; we'll demolish
their castle, I’ll warrant you ; they shall plant no colony
in our dominions.”
Upon this they were all trooping away, with every man
a gun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent
l
l ,
things among themselves of what they would do to the
Spaniards, too, when opportunity offered ; but the Span-
iards, it seems, did not so perfectly understand them as to
know all the particulars, only that in general they threat-
ened them hard for taking the two Englishmen’s part.
Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time that
evening, the Spaniards said they did not know ; but it
seems they wandered about the country part of the night,
and then lying down in the place which I used to call my
bower, they were weary and overslept themselves. The
case was this: they had resolved to stay till midnight, and
so take the two poor men when they were asleep, and as

huts while they were in them, and either burn them there
or murder them as they came out. As malice seldom
sleeps very sound, it was very strange they should not
have been kept awake. However, as the two men had also
a design upon them, as I have said, though a much faire"v
one than that, of burning and murdering, it happened, and
very luckily for them all, that they were up and gone’
abroad before the bloody-minded rogues came to their
huts. ~

indeed, to anything, but they pulled down both their
houses, not leaving the least stick standing, or scarce any
sign on the ground where they stood ; they tore all their
household stuff in pieces, and threw everything about in
such a manner, that the poor men afterward found some
of their things a mile off. When they had done this, they
pulled up all the young trees which the poor men had
planted; broke vdown an inclosure they made to secure
their cattle and their corn; and, in a word, sacked and
plundered everything as completely as a horde of Tartars
would have done.

When they were thus disarmed, and found they had

Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and with
great reluctance ; but the Spaniards protested that they
did it only to keep them. from bloodshed, and to make
them all easy at last. “ For, said they, “ we are not so

the governor, and two more with him, walking by the side ‘
of the creek, they came up in a very submissive, humble
manner, and begged to be received again into the society.
The Spaniards used them civilly, but told them they had
acted so unnaturally to their countrymen, and so very
grosslv to themselves, that they could not come to any con-
clusion without consulting the two Englishmen and the
rest ; but, however, they would go to them and discourse
about it, and they should know in half an hour. It may
be guessed that they were very hard put to it; for, as they
were to wait this half hour for an answer, they begged
they would send them out some bread in the meantime,
which they did, sending at the same time a large piece of
310 ROBINSON CRUSOE.
eagerly.
After half an hour's consultation they were called in,
and a long debate ensued, their two countrymen charging
them with the ruin ofv all their labor, and a design to mur-
der them;all which they owned before, and therefore
could not deny now. Upon the whole, the Spaniards
acted the moderators betWeen them; and as they had
obliged two Englishmen not to hurt the three while
they were naked and unarmed. so they now obliged
the three to go and rebuild their fellows’ two huts,
one to be of the same and the other of larger dimen-
sions than they were before; to fence their ground again,
plant trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up the land
‘ut’a
again for planting corn, and, in a word, to restore every-
thing to the same state as they found it, that is, as near as
' they could. ‘
Well, they submitted to all this ; and as they had plenty
of provisions given them all the while, they grew very
orderly, and the whole society began to live pleasantly
and agreeably together again ; only that these three fel-
lows could never be persuaded to work—I mean for
themselves—except now and then a little, just as they
pleased; however, the Spaniards told them plainly that
if they would but live sociably and friendly together,
and study the good of the whole plantation, they would be
content to work for them, and let them walk about and be
as idle as they pleased; and thus, having lived pretty well
together for a. month or two, the Spaniards let them have
arms again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with them
as before.
It was not above a week after they had these arms, and
went abroad, before the ungrateful creatures began to .1
be as insolent and troublesome as ever; however, an
accident happened presently upon this, which endangered
the safety of them all, and they were obliged to lay by
all private resentments, and look to the preservation of
their lives.
It happened one night that the governor, the Spaniard
whose life I had saved, who was now the governor of the
rest, found himself very uneasy in the night, and could by
no means get any sleep: he! was perfectly well in body,
only found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran upon

awake, and could not by any means get any sleep; in short,
he lay a great while, but growing more and more uneasy,
he resolved to rise. As they lay, being so many of them,
on goat-skins laid thick upon such couches and pads as
they made for themselves, so they had little to do, when
they were willing to rise, but to get upon their feet, and
perhaps put on a coat, such as it was, and their pumps,
and they were ready for going any way that their thoughts
guided them. Being thus got up, he looked out ; but
being dark, he could see little or nothing, and besides, the
trees which I had planted, and which were now grown
tall, intercepted his sight, so that he could only look up,
and see that it was a starlight night, and hearing no noise,

he returned and lay down again ; but to no purpose; as
could not compose himself to anything like test ; bht his‘
thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, and he knew not
for what. Having made some noise with rising and 'walk-
ing about, going out and coming in, another of them
waked, and asked who it was that was up. The governor
told him how it had been with him. “ Say you so i " says
the other Spaniard ; “ such things are not to be slighted, I
assure you ; there is certainly some mischief Working near
us ; ” and presently he asked him, “ Where are the English-

and by accident, on'their usual bloody errand, the Spam-
.iargls pould not understand ; but whatever it was, it was
their business either to have Qoncealed themselves pr not
to have seen them at all, much less to have let the savages
have seen there were any inhabitants in the place; or to
have fallen upon them so effeptually as not a man of them
should have escaped, which coulgl only have been by get-
ting in between them and their boats ; but this presence
of mind was wanting to them, which was the ruin of their
tranquillity for a great while.

done, for they were some of them two miles off from
the other ; and, as it appeared afterward, were of two dif-

After having mused a great while on the course they
should take, they resolved at last, while it was still dark,
to send the old savage, Friday's father, out as a spy, to

father used all the arguments he could to persuade our
people to lie close, and not be seen ; he told them their
safety consisted in it, and they had nothing to do but
lie still, and the savages would kill one another to their
hands, and then the rest would go away ; and it was so
to a tittle. But it was impossible to prevail, especially
upon the Englishmen ; their curiosity was so importunate
that they must run out and see the battle ; however, they
used some caution, too ; they did not go' openly, just by
their own dwelling, but went further into the woods, and

running as into a thick wood for shelter, The scout they
kept to look abroad gave notice of this within, with this
comforting addition, that the conquerers had not pursued
them, or seen which way they were gone ; upon this, the
Spanish governor, a man of humanity, would not suffer
them to kill the three fugitives, but sending three men
out by the top of the hill, ordered them to 'go round, come
in behind them, and surprise and take them prisoners;

had the island again free to themselves, their fright was \

the consequences appeared terrible to the last degree,

friends—for common danger, as I said above, had effect-

consideration was whether, seeing the savages particularly
haunted that side of the island, and that there were more
remote and retired parts of it equally adapted to their way
of living, and manifestly to their advantage, they should
not rather move their habitation, and plant in some more
proper place for their safety, and especially for the
security of their cattle and corn. 1
Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that they
would not remove their habitation; because that, some
time or other, they thought they might hear from their
governor again, meaning me; and if I should send any one
to seek them, I should be sure to direct them to that side,

would conclu e the savages had killed us all, and we were
gone, and so our supply would go too. But, as to their
corn and cattle, they agreed to remove them into the val-
ley where my cave was, where the land was as proper for
both, and where indeed,there was land enough. However,
upon second thoughts, they altered one part of their res-
olution too, and resolved only to remove part of their cat-
tle thither, and plant part of their corn there ; so that if
one part was destroyed, the other might be saved. And
one part of prudence they luckily used; they never trusted
those three savages which they had taken prisoners with
knowing anything of the plantation they had made in that
valley, or of any cattle they had there, much less of the
cave at that place, which they kept, in case of necessity,
as a safe retreat; and thither they carried also the two
barrels of powder which I had sent them at my coming
away. They resolved, however, not to change their habi—

in their being concealed, they set to work to cover and
conceal the place yet more effectually than before. For
this purpose, as I planted trees, or rather thrust in stakes,

leaving any place to land, or any sign that there had been
any landing thereabouts—these stakes also being of a
wood very forward to grow, they took care to have them
generally much larger and taller than those which I had
planted. As they grew apace, they planted them so very
thick and close together, that when they had been three
or four years grown there was no piercing with the eye
any considerable way into the plantation. As for that
part which I had planted, the trees were grown as thick
as a man’s thigh, and among them, they had placed so
many other short ones, and so thick, that it stood like a
palisado a quarter of a mile thick, and it was next to im-
possible to penetrate it, for a little dog could hardly get
between the trees, they stood so close. .
But this was not all; for they did the same by all the
ground to the right hand and to the left, and round even
to the side of the hill, leaving no way, not so much as for
themselves, to come out but by the ladder placed up to

was taken down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft
to assist it could come at them. This was excellently well
contrived; nor was it less than what they afterward found
occasion for, which served to convince me, that as human’
prudence has the authority of Providence to justify it, so-
it has doubtless the direction of Providence to set it to
work; and if we listened carefully to the voice of it, I am
persuaded we might prevent many of the disasters which
our lives are now, by our own negligence, subjected to.
They lived two years after this in perfect retirement,
and had no more visits from the savages.‘ They had, in-
deed, an alarm given them one morning, which put them
into a great consternation; for some of the Spaniards being
out early one morning on the west side or end of the




island (which was that end where I never went, for fear
of being discovered), they were surprised with seeing
about twenty canoes of Indians just coming on shore.
They made the best of their way home in hurry enough ;
and giving the alarm to their comrades, they kept close
all that day and the next, going outfonly at night to make
their observation; but they had the good luck to be undis-
covered, for wherever the savages went, they did not land
that time on the island, but pursued some other design.

AND now they had another’broil with the three English-
men ; one of whom, a most turbulent fellow, being in a
rage at one of the three captive slaves, because the fellow _
had not done something right which he bade him do, and
seemed a little untractable in his showing him, drew a
hatchet out Of a frog-belt which he wore by his side, and
fell upon the poor savage, not to correct him, but to kill
him. One of the Spaniards, who was by, seeing him give
the fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which be
aimed at his head, but stuck into his shoulder, so that he
thought he had cut the poor creature’s arm Off, ran to
him, and, entreating him not to murder the poor man,
placed himself between him and the savage, to prevent the
mischief. The fellow, being enraged the more at this,
struck at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he
would serve him as he intended to serve the savage;,
which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and

made at the two last Spaniards, and wounded them both.
This fray set the whole family in an uproar, and more
help coming in, they took the three Englishmen prisoners.
The next question was, what should be done with,
them? They had been so often mutinous, and were
so,very furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, they
knew not what course to take with them, for they Were
mischievous to the highest degree, and cared not what
hurt they did to any man; so that, in short, it was not
safe to live with them.
The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many
words, that if they had been of his own country he would
have hanged them ; for all laws and all governors were to
preserve society, and those who were dangerous to the
society ought to be expelled out of it; but as they were
Englishmen, and that it was to the generous kindness or i
an Englishman that they all owed their preservation and
deliverance, he would use them with all possible lenity,
and would leave them to the judgment of the other two
Englishmen, who were their countrymen. One of the
two honest Englishmen stood up, and said they desired it
might not be left to them. “ For,” says he, ‘- I am sure
we ought to sentence them to the gallows ; and with that.

and murder all the Spaniards when they were in their
sleep. ,
When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will
Atkins, “ How, Senor Atkins, would you murder us all?
What have you to say to that? ’ The hardened villain was
so far from denying it, that he said it was true, and swore
they would do it still before they had done with them.
“ Well, but, Senor Atkins,” says the Spaniard, “what
have we done to you that you will kill us? What would
you get by killing us? And what must we do to prevent
you killing us? Must we kill you,'or you kill us? Why
will you put us to the necessity of this, Senor Atkins ? " ‘
says the Spaniard, very calmly, and smiling. Senor Atkins
was in such a rage at the Spaniards" making a jest of it,
that, had he not been held by three men, and withal had‘
no weapon near him, it was thought he would have at-
tempted to kill the Spaniard in the middle of all the com-
pany. This hair-brain carriage obliged them to consider

seriously what was to be done. The two Englishmen,
and the Spaniard who saved the poor savage, were of the
opinion that they should hang one of the three for an ex-
ample to the rest, and that particularly it should be he
that had twice attempted to commit murder with his
hatchet; indeed, there was some reason to believe he had
done it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable con-
dition with the wound he had received that it was thought
he could not live. But the governor Spaniard still ’s’aid
no ; it was an Englishman that had saved all their lives,
and he would never consent to put an Englishman to
death, though he had murdered half of them; nay, he
said if he had been killed himself by an Englishman, and
had time left to speak, it should be that they should par-
don him.
This was so positively insisted on by the governor Span-
iard,‘that there was no gainsaying it ; and as merciful
counsels are most apt to prevail where they are so earn-
estly pressed, so they all came into it; but then it was to
be cOnsidered what should be done to keep them from
doing the mischief they designed; for'they all agreed,
governor and all, that means were to be used for preserv~
ing the society from danger. After a long debate, it was
agreed that they should be disarmed, and not permitted
to have either gun, powder, shot, sword, or any weapon;
that they should be turned out of the society, and left
to live where they would, by themselves ; and that
none of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should
‘ hold any kind of converse with them, or have any-
thing to do with them; that they should be forbid to
come within a certain distance of the place where the
rest dwelled; and if they offered to commit any dis-
order, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of the
corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the
society,they should die without mercy, and would shoot

long ere they can raise corn and cattle of their own, and
they must not starve ; we must therefore allow them pro-

have a proportion of corn given them to last them eight
months, and for seed to sow, by which time they might be
supposed to raise some of their own ; that they should
have six milch-goats, four he-goats, and six kids given
them, as well for present subsistence as for a store ; and
that they should have tools given them for their work in

provisions unless they would swear solemnly that they
would not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with them,
or any 'of their fellow-Englishmen.
Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them
out to shift for themselves. They went away sullen and
refractory, as neither content ‘to go away nor to stay ; but,
as there was no remedy, they went, pretending to go and
choose a place where they would settle themselves; and .
some provisions were given them, but no weapons. About

and gave the governor an account where they had pitched
their tents, and marked themselves out a habitation and
plantation ; and it was a very convenient place indeed, on
the remotest part of the island, N. E., much about the

growing on three sides of it, so that by planting others it
would be very easily COVered from the sight, unless narrow-
ly searched for. They desired some dried goat-skins for,
beds and covering, which were given them; and upon giv-

injure any of their plantations, they gave them hatchets,
and what other tools they could spare ; some pease, barley,

except arms and ammunition.

but small, the parcel of land they had planted being but
little. Indeed, having all their plantation to form, they \
had a great deal of work upon their hands. and when they
came to make boards and pots, and such things, they were
Quite out of their element, and could make nothing of it;
therefore when the rainy season came on, for want of a
M
v-
cave in the earth, they could not keep their grain dry, and
it was in great danger of spoiling. This humbled them
much : so they came and begged the Spaniards to help
them, which they very readily did ; and in four days
worked a great hole in the side of the hill for them,
big enough to secure their corn and other things from
the rain ; but it was a poor place _at best compared
to mine, and especially as mine wasthen, for the Span-
iards had greatly enlarged it, and made several new apart-
.ments in it.
About three quarters of a year after this separation, at
new frolic took these rogues, which, together With the for-
mer villainy they had commited, brought mischief enough
upon them, and had very near been the ruin of the whole
colony. The three new associates began, it seems, to be
weary of the laborious life they led, and that without hope
of bettering their circumstances ; and a whim took them
that they would make a voyage to the continent, from
whence the savages came, and would try if they could seize
upon some prisoners among the natives there, and bring
them home, so as to make them do the laborious part of
the work for them.
The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone
no further. But they did nothing, and proposed nothing,
but had either mischief in the design, or mischief in the
event. And if I may give my opinion, they seemed to be
under a blast from Heaven: for if we will not allow a
visible curse to pursue visible crimes, how shall we recon-
cile the events of things with the divine justice? It was
certainly an apparent vengeance on their crime of mutiny
and piracy that brought them to the state they were in ;
and they showed not the least remorse for the crime, but
added new villainies to it, such as the piece of monstrous
cruelty of wounding a poor—slave because he did not, or
.perhaps could not, understand to do what he was directed,
and to wound him in such a manner as made him a cripple
all his life, and in a place where no surgeon or medicine
could be had for his cure ; and, what was still worse, the
intentional murder, for such to be sure it was, as was after-'
ward the formed design they all laid to murder the Span-l
iards in cold blood, and in their sleep. .
The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one
'morning, and in very humble terms desired to be admitted
w'
to speak with them. The Spaniards very readily neard
what they had to say, which was this : that they were
tired of living in the manner they did, and that they were
not handy enough to make the necessaries they wanted,
and that having no help, they found they should be
starved; but if the Spaniards would give them leave to
take one of the canoes which they came over in, and give
them arms and ammunition proportioned to their defense,
they would go over to the main, and seek their fortunes,
and so deliver them from the trouble of supplying them
with any other provisions. . ‘
The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but
very honestly represented to them the certain destruction
they were running into ; told them they had suffered such
hardships upon that very spot, that they could, without
any spirit of prophecy, tell them they would be starved or
murdered, and bade them consider of it. The men replied
audaciously, they should be starved if they stayed here,
for they could not work, and would not work, and they
could but be starved abroad ; and if they were murdered,
there was an end of them ; they had no wives or children
to cry after them ; and, in short, insisted importunely upon
their demand, declaring they would go, whether they gave
them any arms or not. t
The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if
they were resolved to go they should not go like naked
men,and be in no condition to defend themselves; and
324, ‘ ROBINSON cnusoa.
enough for themselves, yet they would let them have two
muskets, a pistol, and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet,

over the sea, where it "was at least forty miles broad. The

made a mast of a long pole, and a sail of four large goat-
skins dried, which they had sewed or laced together; and -
away they went merrily together. The Spaniards called
after them “ Ban Voyajo .' " and no man ever thought of
seeing them any more.
The Spaniards were often saying to one another, and to
the two honest Englishmen who remained behind, how
quietly and comfortably they lived, now these three turbu-
lent fellows were gone. As for their coming again, that
was the remotest thing from their thoughts that could be
imagined ; when, behold, after two-and-twenty days’ ab-
sence, one of the Englishmen being abroad upon his plant-
ing work, sees three strange men coming toward him at a.
distance, with guns upon their shoulders. '
Away runs the Englishman, frightened and amazed, as
if he was bewitched, to the governor Spaniard, and tells
'him they were all undone, for there were strangers upon
the island, but he could not tell who they were. The
Spaniard, pausing awhile, says to him, “ How do you
mean—you can not tell who ? They are the savages, to be
sure." “ No, no,” says the Englishman, “ they are men
in clothes, with arms.” “ Nay. then,” says the Spaniard,
“ why are you so concerned P If they are not savages they
must befriends; for there is no Christian nation upon
earth but will do us good rather than harm." While they
were debating thus, came up the three Englishmen, and
standing without the wood, which was new planted,
hallooed to them. They presently knew their voices, and
so all the wonder ceased. But now the admiration was
turned upon another question: What could be the matter,
and what made them come back again ?
It was not long before they brought the men in, and in-
quiring wnere they had been, and what they had been
doing, they gave them a full account of their voyage in a
few words: That they reached the land in less than two

they perceived that the land they saw from our island was
not the main, but an island: that upon entering that open-

north, and several more west ; and being resolved to land
somewhere, they put over to one of the islands which lay

in his war, and they were feeding them to make them fat
for the next feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty de-
sirous of seeing those prisoners ; but the others mistaking
them, thought they were desirous to have some of them to
carry away for their eating. So they beckoned to them,
pointing to the setting of the sun, and then to the rising;

on their voyage, just as he would bring so many cows and
oxendown to a sea-port town to victual a ship.
As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home,
their stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know
what to do. To refuse the prisoners would have been the
highest affront to the savage gentry that could be offered '
them, and what to do with them they knew not. However
after some debate, they resolved to accept of them : and,
in return, they gave the savages that brought them one
of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of
their bullets ; which, though they did not understand
their use, they seemed particularly pleased with; and then
tying the poor creatures’ hands behind them, they dragged
the prisoners into the boat for our men.
The Englishmen were obliged 'to come away as soon as
they had them, or else they that gave them' this noble
present would certainly have expected that they should
have gone to work with them, have killed two or three of
them the next morning, and, perhaps have invited the
donors to dinner. But having taken their leave, with all
the respect and thanks that could well pass between peo-
ple, where, on either side, they understood not one Word

they set eight of their prisoners at liberty, there being too
many of them for their occasion. In their voyage they
endeavored to have some communication with their pris-

thing. Nothing they could say to them, or give them, or do
for them, but was looked upon as going to murder theme

just felt the knife at their throats; for they immediately
concluded they were unbound on purpose to be killed.

still they expected every day to make a dinner or'a supper

When the three Wanderers had given this unaccountable
history or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard asked
them where their new famil was; and being told that
_they had brought them on s ore, and put them into one
,of their huts, and were come up to beg some victuals for
them, they (the Spaniards) and the other two English-
men, that is to say, the whole colony, resolved to go all
down to the place and see them: and did so, and Friday’s,v
father with them. When they came into the hut, there
they sat, all bound ; for when they had brought them on
shore they bound their hands that they might not take
the boat and make their escape; there, I say, they sat, all
of them stark naked. First, there were three comely fel_

both in shape and features, only tawny ; and two of them,
had they been perfectly white, would have passed for very
handsome women, even in London, having pleasant coun-
tenances, and of a very modest behavior ; especially when
they came afterward to be clothed and dressed, though
that dress was very indifferent, it must be confessed.
The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to
our Spaniards, who were, to give them a just character,
men of the most calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good
humor, that ever I met with; and, in particular of the

them, and then if he understood any of their speech. As
soon as the old man came in, he looked‘seriously at them,
but knew none of them; neither could any of them under-
stand a word he said, or a sign he could make, except one
of the women. However, this was enough to answer the
end, which was to satisfy them that the men into whose
hands they were fallen were Christians ; that they abhorred
eating men or women ; and that they might be sure they
would not be killed. As soon as they were assured of
this, they discovered such a joy, and by such awkward
gestures, several ways, as is hard to describe; for it seems
they were of seVeral nations. The woman who was their
interpreter was bid, in the next place, to ask them if they
were willing to be servants, and to work for the men who
hadgbrought them away, to save their lives ; at which they
all fell a-dancing; and presently one fell to taking up this,
and another that, anything that lay next, to carry on their
shoulders, to intimate they were willing to work.
The governor, who found that the having women among
them would presently be attended with some inconvenience,
and might occasion some strife, and perhaps blood, asked
the three men what they intended to do with these women,
. . y,
.,>...
and how they intended to use them, whether as servants
or as wives ? One of the Englishmen answered, very
boldly and readily, that they would use them as both ; to
which the governor said : “ I am not going to restrain you
from it—you are your own masters as to that ; but this I
think is but just, for avoiding disorders and quarrels among
you, and I desire it of you for that reason only—viz., that
you will all engage, that if any of you take any of these
women as a wife, he shall take but one ; and that having
taken one, none else shall touch her; for though we can
not marry any one of you, yet it is but reasonable that,
while you stay here, the woman any of you takes shall be
maintained by the man that takes her, and should be
his wife—I mean," says he, “ while he continues here, and
that none else shall have anything to 'do with“ her." All
this appeared so just, that every one agreed to it without
any difficulty. _
Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they de-
signed to take any of them? But every one of them
answered “ No.” Some of them said they had wives in
Spain, and the others did not like women that were not
Christians ; and all together declared that they would not
touch one of them, which was an instance of such virtue
as I have not met with in all my travels. On the other

that is to say, a temporary wife ; and so they set up a new
form of living; for the Spaniards and Friday's father lived
in my old habitation, which they had enlarged exceedingly
within. The three servants which were taken in the last
battle of the savages lived with them; and these carried on
the main part of the colony, supplied all the rest with food,
and assisted them in anything as they could, or as they
found necessity required.

fellow considered better than any of them, that it was ap-
plication and business they were to expect assistance in,
as much as in anything else ; and she proved the best
wife of all the parcel. ,
When the poor women saw themselves set in av row thus,
and fetched out one by one, the terrors of their condition

were now going to be devoured. Accordingly, when the
English sailor came in and fetched out one of them, the
rest set up a most lamentable cry, and hung about her, '
and took their leave of her with such agonies and affection
as would have grieved the hardest heart in the world; nor
was it possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them that
they were not to be immediately murdered, till they fetched

by one, had chosen them for their wives. When they had
done, and the fright the women were in was a little over,
the men went to work, and the Spaniards came and helped
- them ; and in a few hours they had built them every one
a new hut or tent for their lodging apart ; for those they
had already were crowded with their tools, household stuff,
and provisions. The three wicked ones had pitched furthest
off, and the two honest ones nearer, but both on the north
shore of the island, so that they continued separated
as before ; and thus my island was peopled in three
places, and, as I might say, three towns were begun to be
built.
And here it is very well worth observing that, as it often
happens in the world (what the wise ends of God’s provi-
dence are, in such a dispostition of things, I can not say),
the two honest fellows had the two worst wives ; and the

most willing, quiet, passive, and subjected creatures,
rather like slaves than wives; but my meaning is, they
were not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, or alike
cleanly and neat. Another observation I must make, to
the honor of a diligent application on one hand, and to
the disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle temper on the
other, that when I came to the place and viewed the sev-
-eral improvements, plantings, and management of the
several little colonies, the two men had so far outgone the
three, that there was no comparison. They had, indeed,
both of them as much ground laid out for corn as they
wanted, and the reason was, because, according to my
rule, nature dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more
com than they wanted ; but the difference of the cultiva»
tion, of the planting, of the fences, and, indeed, of every-
ROBINSON cnusou. 33!
The two men had innumerable young trees planted
about their huts, so that, when you came to the place,
nothing was to be seen but a wood; and though they had
twice had their plantation demolished, once by their own
' countrymen, and once by the enemy, as shall be shown in
its place, yet they had restored all again, and everything
was thriving and flourishing about them ; they had grapes
planted in order, and managed like a vineyard, though
they had themselves never seen anything of that kind, and
by their good ordering their vines, their grapes were as
good again as any of the others. They had also found
themselves out a. retreat in the thickest part of the woods,
where, though there was not a natural cave, as I had
found, yet they made one with incessant labor of their
hands, and where, when the mischief which followed hap-
pened, they secured their wives and children so as they
could never be found ; they having, by sticking in-
numerable stakes and poles of the wood which, as I
said, grew so readily, they made the grove impassable,
except in some places, when they climbed up to get over
the outside part, and then went on by ways of their own
leaving. ~
As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, though
they were much civilized by their settlement compared to
what they were before, and were not so quarrelsome, hav-
ing not the same opportunity; yet one of the certain

the slothful, and it was all overgrown with thorns ;” for
when the Spaniards came to view their crop they could
not see it in some places for weeds, the hedge had sev-
eral gaps in it, where the wild goats had got in and
eaten up the corn; perhaps here and there a dead bush
was crammed in, to stop them out for the present, but
it was only shutting the stable-door after the steed was
stolen. Whereas, when they looked on the colony of
the other two, there was the very face of industry and suc-
cess upon all they did ; there was not a weed to be seen
in all their corn, or a gap in any of their hedges; and they,

“That the diligent hand maketh rich ;" for everything
grew and thrived, and they had plenty within and without;
they had more tame cattle than- the others, more uten-
sils and necessaries within doors, and yet more pleasure
and diversion too.
It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and
cleanly within doors; and having learned the English ways
of dressing and cooking from one of the other Englishmen,
who, as I said, was a cook’s mate on board the ship, they
dressed their husbands’ victuals very nicely and well;
whereas the others could not be brought to understand it;
but then the husband, who, as I say, had been cook's
mate, did it himself. But as for the husbands of the three
wives, they loitered about, fetched turtles' eggs, and

they fared accordingly. The diligent lived well and com-
fortably, and the slothful hard and beggarly; and so, I
Believe, generally speaking, it is all over the world.
But I now come to a scene different from all that had
happened before, either to them or to me ; and the origin
of the story was this: Early one morning there came on

which you please, and there is no room to doubt they
came upon the old errand of feeding upon their slaves:
but that part was now so familiar to the Spaniards, and to
our men, too, that they did not concern themselves about
it, as I did : but having been made sensible, by their ex-
perience, that their only business was to lie concealed, and
RoamsdN CRUSOE. 333 .
that if they were not seen by any of the savages they
would go off again quietly, when their business was done,
having, as yet, not the least notion of there being any in-
habitants in the island ; I say, having been made sensible
of this, they had nothing to do but to give notice to all
the three plantations to keep within doors, and not show
themselves, only placing a scout in a proper place, to give
notice when the boats went to sea again.
This was, without doubt, very right ; but a disaster
spoiled all these measures, and made it known among the
savages that there were inhabitants there; which was, in
the end, the desolation of almost the whole colony. After
the canoes with the savages were gone off, the Spaniards
peeped abroad again; and some of them had the curiosity
to go to the place where they had been, to see what they
had been doing. Here, to their great surprise, they found
three savages left behind, and lying fast asleep upon the
ground. It was supposed they had either been so gorged
with their inhuman feast, that, like beasts, they were fallen
asleep, and would not stir when the others went, or they
had wandered into the woods, and did not come back in
time to be taken in.
The Spaniards were greatly surprised'at this sight, and
perfectly at a loss what to do. The Spaniard governor,
as it happened, was with them, and his advice was asked,
but he professed he knew not what to do. As for slaves,
they had enough already; and as to killing them, there
were none of them inclined todo that; the Spaniard gov—
ernor told me they could not think of shedding innocent
blood ; for as to them, the poor creatures had done them
no wrong, invaded none of their property, and they
_, thought they had no just quarrel against them to take
away their lives. And here I must, in justice to these
Spaniards, observe,'that let the accounts of Spanish cru-
elty in Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met
with seventeen men of any nation whatsoever, in any for-
eign country, who were so universally modest, temperate.
virtuous, so very good-humored, and so courteous, as
these Spaniards: and as to cruelty, they had nothing of it
in their very nature: no inhumanity, no barbarity, no out-v
rageous passions : and yet all of them men of great cour-
age and spirit. Their temper and calmness had appeared
in their bearing the insufferable usage of the three English-
334 ROBINSON CRUSOE.
men; and their justice and humanity appeared now in the
case of the savages as above. After some consultation
they resolved upon this : that they would lie still a while
longer, till, if possible, these three men might be gone.
But then the governor‘recollected that the three savages
had no boat; and if they were left to rove about the island,
they would certainly discover that there were inhabitants
in it; and so they should be undone that way» Upon this,
they went back again, and there lay the fellows fast asleep
still, and so they resolved to awaken them, and take them
_ prisoners ; and they did, so. The poor fellows were
strangely frightened when they were seized upon and
bound; and afraid, like the women, that they should be
murdered and eaten: for it seems those people think'all

intelligence of them was, that about two months after this,
six canoes of savages, with about seven, eight, or ten men
in a canoe, came rowing along the north side of the island,
where they never used to come before, and landed, about’
' an hour after sunrise, at a convenient place, about a mile
, from the habitation of the two Englishmen, where this
escaped man had been kept. As the chief Spaniard said

too much odds. The two men had the happiness to dis-
cover them about a league off, so that it was above an
hour before they landed ; and as they landed a mile from
their huts, it was some time before they could come at
them. Now, having great reason to believe that they were

slaves which were left, and cause two of the three 'iznen
whom they brought with the women (who, it seems,
proved very faithful to them), to lead them, with their
two wives, and whatever they could carry away with them,
to their retired places in the woods, which I have spoken
of above, and there to bind the two fellows hand and foot,
till they heard further. In the next place, seeing the
savages were all come on shore, and that they had bent
their course directly that Way, they opened the fences
where the milch c0ws were kept, and drove them all out ;
leaving their goats to straggle in the woods, whither they
pleased, that the savages might think they were all bred
wild; but the rogue who came with them was too cunning
for that, and gave them an account of it all, for they went
directly to the place. -
When the two poor frightened men had secured their
wives’and goods, they sent the other slave they had of the
three who came with the women, and Who was at their
place by accident, away to the Spaniards with all speed, to
give them the alarm, and desire s eedy help, and, in the
meantime, they took their arms an what ammunition they
had, and' retreated toward the place in the wood where
their wives were sent \; keeping at a distance, yet so that

them, irretrievable, indeed, for some time. They kept
their station for awhile, till they found the savages, like
wild beasts, spread themselves all over the place, rummag-
ing every way, and every place they could think of, in
search of prey; and in particular for the people, of whom
now it plainly appeared they had intelligence.
The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves
not secure where they stood, because it was likely some of
the wild people might come that way, and they might
come too many together, thought it proper to make an-
other retreat about half a mile further; believing, as it
afterward happened, that the further they strolled, the
fewer would be together. Their next halt was at the en-_
trance into a very thick-grown part of the woods, and
where an old trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow and
very large; and in this tree they both took their standing,
resolving to see there what might offer. They had not
sto'od there long before two of the savages appeared run-
ning directly that way, as if they already had noticed
where they stood, and were coming up to attack them;
and a little way further they espied three more coming

loop-hole, as it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he
took a sure aim, without being seen, waiting till they were
within about thirty yards of the tree, so that he could not

While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on,
they plainly saw that one of the three was the runaway
savage that had escaped from them ; and they both knew
him distinctly, and resolved that, if possible, he should not

but was not quite dead ; and the third had a little scratch

the body of the setond; and being dreadfully frightened,
though not so much hurt, sat down upon the ground,
screaming and yelling in a hideous manner.

to the place where their companions lay in a condition
miserable enough. Here the poor ignorant creatures, not
sensible that they were within reach of the same mischief,

may be supposed, inquiring of him how he came to be

This, I say, is rational ; for nothing is more certain than

frightened even to death, though not hurt, fell with the rest;
so that our men, seeing them all fall together, thought they
had killed them all.
The belief that the savages were all killed made our two
men come boldly out from the tree before they had charged
their guns, which wasa wrOng step ; and they were under

made sure of the runaway savage, that had been the cause
of all the mischief, and of another that was hurt in the
knee, and put them out of their pain ; then the man
that Was not hurt at all came and knelt down to them,
with his two hands held up, and made piteous moans
to them, by gestures and signs, for his life, but could
not say one word to them that they could understand.
However, they made signs to him to sit down at the
foot of a} tree hard by; and one of the Englishmen,
with a plece of rope-yarn, which he had by great chance
in his pocket, tied his two hands behind him, and there
they left him; and with what speed they could made

covered place in the woods, where their wives, and the few
goods they had left, lay. They came once in sight of the
two men,but it was at a great distance; however, they had
the satisfaction to see them cross over a valley toward the
sea, quite the contrary way from that which led to their
Rosmson CRUSOE. 339
with that they went back to where they left their pris-
oner, who, as they supposed, was delivered by his com-
rades, for he was gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn
with which they had bound him lay just at the foot of
the tree. '
They were now in as great concern as before, not
knowing what course to take, or' how near the enemy
might be, or in what number; so they resolved to go
away to the place where their wives were, to see if all
was well there, and to make them easy. These were in
fright enough, to be sure ; for though the savages were
their own countrymen,yet they were most terribly afraid
of them, and perhaps the more for the knowledge they
‘ had of them. When they came there,_ they found the
savages had been in the wood, and very near that place,
but had not found it ; for it was indeed inaccessible, from
the trees standing so thick, unless the persons seeking it
had been directed by those that knew it, which these did
not ; they found, therefore, everything very safe, only the
women in a terrible fright. .While they were here they
had the comfort to have seven of the Spaniards come
to their assistance; the other ten, with their servants,
and Friday’s father, were gone in a body to defend
their bower, and the corn and cattle that were kept
there, in case the savages should have roved over to
that side of the country; but they did not spread so
far. With the seven Spaniards came one of the three
savages, who, as I said, were their prisoners formerly;
and with them also came the savage whom the English-
men had left bound hand and foot at the tree; for it seems
they came that way, saw the slaughter of the seven men,
and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with them;
where, however, they were obliged to bind him again, as
they had the two others who were left when the third ran
away.
The prisoners now began to be a burden to them ; and
they were so afraid of their escaping that they were once
resolving to kill them all, believing they were under an
absolute necessity to do so for their own preservation.
However, the chief of the Spaniards would not consent to
it, but ordered, for the present, that they should be sent
out of the way to my old cave in the valley, and be kept
there, with two Spaniards to guard them, and have food
for their subsistence, which was done; and they were bound .
there hand and foot for that night.
When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were
so encouraged, that they could not satisfy themselves to

see that some more of the savages had been there, for they

ages. They then resolved, though with all possible can-
tion, to go forward toward their ruined plantation ; but, a
little before they came thither, coming in sight of the sea-
shore, they saw plainly the savages all embarked again in
their canoes, in order to be gone. They seemed sorry at
34° ROBINSON CRUSOE-
a parting blow ; but, upon the whole, they were very well '
34° ROBINSON CRUSOE-
The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all
their improvements destroyed, therest all agreed to come
and help them to rebuild, and assist them with needful sup-
, plies. Their three countrymen, who were not yet noted for
having the least inclination to do any good, yet as soon as
they heard of it (for they, living remote eastward, knew
nothing of the matter till all was over), came and offered
their help and assistance, and did, very friendly, work for
several days to restore their habitation and make neCessav
ries for them. And thus in a little time they were set upon
their legs again.
About two days after this they had the further satisfac-
tion of seeing three of the savages’ canoes come driving
on shore, and, at some distance from them, two drowned
men, by which they had reason to believe that they had
met with a storm at sea, which had overset some of them, .
for it had blown very hard the night after they went off.
However, as some might miscarry, so, on the other hand,
enough of them escaped to inform the rest, as well of what
they had done as of what had happened to them ; and to
whet them on to another enterprise of the same nature,

next morning early they posted themselves, with all their

coming. As they guessed, so it happened : these new in-

The chief Spaniard, whom I described so often, com-

commanded under him. The savages came forward like
lions; and our men, which was the worst of their fate, had
no advantage in their situation; only that Will Atkins,

ages; they were frightened to the last degree to hear such
a dreadful noise, and see their men killed, and others
hurt, but see nobody that did it ; when, in the middle of

a 7- "ioBrNsoN cnusoa. 343
the rest of the body been at hand, to have poured in their
shot continually, the savages had been effectually routed ;
for the terror that was among them came principally from
this, that they were killed by the gods with thunder and
lightning, and could see nobody that hurt them. But Will
Atkins, staying to load again, discovered the cheat ; some
of the savages who were at a distance spying them, came
a 7- "ioBrNsoN cnusoa. 343

retiring as fas --/as they could, yet they wounded Atkins
himself, and illed one of his fellow-Englishmen with
their arrows, as they did afterward one Spaniard, and one
of the Indian slaves who came with the women. This
slave'was a most gallant fellow, and fought most desper-

and so we shall have the fewer to engage." This advice
was good: but Will Atkins replied merrily, “ That is true,

go on while I am warm.” “ Well, Senor Atkins,” says
the Spaniard, “ you have behaved gallantly, and done your

But as it was a clear, moonlit night, and they found the
savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded

lay, they afterward resolved to fall upon them in the night,

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedi-

as the halberts and staves. They would have had the
women kept back, but they said they were resolved to die
with their husbands: Having thus formed their little
army, they marched out from among the trees, and came
up to the teeth of the enemy, shouting and hallooing as
loud as they could ; the savages stood all together, but
were in the utmost confusion, hearing the noise of our
men shouting from three quarters together. They would
have fought if they had seen us ; for as soon as we
came near enough to be seen, some arrows were shot,
and poor old Friday was wounded, though not danger-

and eighty of them; the rest, being frightened out of
their wits, scoured through the woods and over the hills,
with all the speed that fear and nimble feet could help
them to ; and as we did not trouble ourselves much to
pursue them, they got all together to the sea-side, where
they landed, and where their canoes lay. But their dis-
aster was not at an end yet; for it blew a terrible storm of
wind that evening from the sea, so that it was impossible
for them to go off ; nay, the storm continuing all night,
when the tide came up their canoes were most of them

At length they came in view of the place whese the more

then consider that this might probably have been the occa-

Will Atkins told them they had better have to do With

showed them the necessity of it so plainly that they all

sions, yet they were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt
them up and down ; for as they were too nimble of foot
for our people when they found them single, so our men
durst not go abroad single, for fear of being surround-
ed with their numbers. The bcst was they had no weap-
ons; for though they had bows, they had no arrows left,
nor any materials to make any ; nor had they any edge-
tools among them. The extremity and distress they were
reduced to was great, and indeed deplorable ; but, at the
same time, our men were also brought to very bad circum-
stances by them, for though their retreats were preserved,
yet their provision was destroyed, and their harvest spoiled
and what to do, or which way to turn themselves, they
knew not. The only refuge they had now was the stock
of cattle they had in the valley by the cave, and some little
corn which grew there, and the plantation of the three
Englishmen. Will Atkins and his comrades were now re-
' duced to two; one of them being killed by an arrow, which
struck him on the side of his head. just under the temple,
so that he never spoke more ; and it was very remarkable
that this was the same barbarous fellow that cut the poor

harass them, and kill as many of them as they could come

at last tame them, and bring them to anything, they would
give them corn, and teach them how to plant, and live
upon their daily labor. In order to do this,’they so fol-

did not hit him, yet he would fall down for fear. So
dreadfully frightened were they that they kept out of
sight further and further; till, at last, our men followed
them, and almost every day killing or wounding some of
them, they kept up in the woods or hollow places so much,
that it reduced them to the utmost misery for want of
food ; and many were afterward found dead in the woods,
without any hurt, absolutely starved to death.
When "our men found this, it made their hearts relent,
and pity moved them, especially the generous-minded
Spaniard governor; and he proposed, if possible, to take
one of them alive, and bring him to understand what they
.meant, so far as to be able to act as interpreter, and go
among them and see if they might be brought to some
conditions that might be depended upon, to save their
lives and do us no harm. ’

kindly fused, and victuals given him, and no violence
offered him, he at last grew tractable, and came to him-
self. They often brought old Friday to talk to him, who
always told him how kind the others would be to them all;
that they would not only save their lives, but give them
part of the island to live in, provided they would give sat-
isfaction that they would keep in their own bounds, and
not come beyond it to injure or prejudice others; and that
they should have corn given them to plant and make it
grow for their'bread, and some bread given them for their
present subsistence;and old Friday bade the fellow go
lalk with the rest of his countrymen, and see what they
laid to it; assuring them that, if they did not agree imme-
diately, they should be all destroyed.

them ; upon which twelve‘Spaniards and two Englishmen,
well armed, with three Indian slaves and old Friday,
marched to the place where they were. The three Indian
slaves carried them a large quantity of bread, some rice
boiled up to cakes and dried in the sun, and three live
goats; and they were ordered to go to the side of a hill,
where they sat down, eat their provisions very thankfully,
and were the most faithful fellows to their words that
could be thought of; for, except when they came to beg“
victuals and directions, they never came out of their
bounds; and there they lived when I came to the island,
and I went to see them. They had taught them both to

surrounded with high rocks behind them, and lying plain
toward the sea before them, on the south-east corner of
theisland. They had land enough, and it was very good
and fruitful ; about a mile and a half broad, and three or
four miles in length. Our men taught them to make
wooden spades, such as I made for myself, and gave
among them twelve hatchets and three or four knives;
and there they lived, the most subjected, innocent creati-
ures that ever were heard of. '
After this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquility with
respect to the savages, till I came to revisit them, which
was about two years after; not but that, now and then,
some canoes of savages came on shore for their triumphal,
unnatural feasts ; but as they were of several nations, and
perhaps had never heard of those that came before, or
the reason of it, they did not make any search or inquiry
after their countrymen; and if they had, it would have
been very hard to have found them out.
Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all that
happened to them till my return. at least that was worth
notice. The Indians were wonderfully civilized by them,
and they frequently went among them; but they forbid,
on pain of death, any one of the Indians coming to them,
because they would not have their settlement betrayed
again. One thing was very remarkable—viz., that they
taught the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets, but
they soon outdid their masters: for they made abundance
of ingenious things in wicker-work, particularly baskets.
sieves, bird-cages, cupboards, etc.; as also chairs, stools,
beds, couches, being very ingenious at such work when
they were once put in the way of it. '
My coming was a particular relief to these people, be-
cause we furnished them with knives, scissors, spades,
shovels, pick-axes, and all things of that kind which they
could want. With the help of these tools they were so~
very handy that they came at last to build up their huts
or houses very handsomely, raddling or working it up
like basket-work all the way round. This piece of in-
genuity, although it looked very odd, was an exceed-
ing good fence, as well against heat as against all sorts
of Vermin; and our men were so taken with it that
they got the Indians to come and do the like for them;
so that when I came to ee the two Englishmen’s colo-
nies, they looked at a dist nce as if they all lived like bees
in a hive. O ‘
As for Will Atkins, who was now become a very indus-
trious, useful, and sober fellow, he had made himself such
a tent of basket work as I believe was never seen ; it was
one hundred and twenty paces round on the outside, as I
measured by my steps; the walls were as close worked
as a- basket, in panels or squares of thirty-two in num-
ber, and very strong, standing about seven feet high; in
the middle was another not above twenty-two paces
round, but built stronger, being octagon in its form,
and in the eight corners stood eight very strong posts;
round the top of which he laid strong pieces, knit to-
gether with wooden pins, from which he raised a pyra-
mid for a handsome roof of eight rafters, joined to-
gether very well, though he had no nails, and only a few
spikes, which he made himself, too, out of the old iron
that I had left there) Indeed, this fellow showed abund-
ance of ingenuity in several things which he had no knowl-
edge of : he made him a forge, with a pair of wooden bel-

work; and he formed out of the iron crows a middling
good anvil to hammer upon: in this manner he made
many things, but especially hooks, staples, and spikes,
bolts and hinges. But to return to the house: after he
had pitched the roof of his innermost tent, he worked it

thatched that over again so ingeniously with rice-straw, and
over that a large leaf of a tree, which covered the top, that
his house was as dry as if it had been tiled or slated. He
owned, indeed, that the savages had made the basket-work
for him. The outercircuit was covered as a lean-to all round
this inner appartment, and long rafters lay from the thirty-
two angles to the top posts of the inner house, being about
twenty feet distant, so that there was a space like a. walk
within the outer wicker‘wall, and without the inner, near
twenty-feet wide. '
The inner place be partitioned off with the same wicker-
work, but much fairer, and divided into six apartments,

into the main tent, another door into the main tent,
and another door into the space or walk that was
round it; so that the walk was also divided into six
equal parts, which served not only for a retreat, but to
store up an necessaries which the family had occasion
for. These six spaces not taking up the whole circum-
ference, what other apartments the out circle had were
thus ordered: As soon as you were in at the door of
the outer circle you had a short passage straight before
you to the door of the inner house; but on either side
was a wicker partition and a door in it, by which you

wide and about thirty feet long, and through that into
another not quite so long; so that in the outer circle
were ten handsome rooms, six of which were only to be
come at through the appartments of the inner tent, and
served as closets or retiring rooms to the respective cham-
bers of the inner circle; and four large warehouses, or barns,
or what you please to call them, which went through one
another,two on either hand of the passage, that led through
the outer door to the inner tent, Such a piece of basket-
work, I believe, was never seen in the world, nor a house
or tent so neatly contrived, much less so built. In this
great bee-hive lived the three families, that is to say, Will
Atkins and his companion ; the third was killed, but his
wife remained with three children, and the other two were
not at all backward to give the widow her full share of
everything, I mean as to their corn, milk, grapes, etc.,ar1d
when they killed a kid, or found a turtle on the shore; so
that they all lived well enough ; though it was true they
were not so industrious as the other two, as has been
observed already.
One thing, however, can not be omitted—viz., that as
for religion, I do not know that there was anything of
that kind among them ;- they often, indeed, put one an-
other in mind that there was a God, by the very common
method of seamen, swearing by His name : nor Were their
poor ignorant savage wives much better “for having been
married to Christians, as we must call them; for they knew
very little of God themselves so they were utterly incapa-
ble of entering into any discourse with their wives about
God, or to talk anything to them concerning religion.
The utmost of all the improvement which I can say the
wives had made from them was, that they had taught
them to speak English pretty well ; and most of their
children, who were near twenty in all, were taught to

mothers were all a good sort of well-governed, quiet, labori-

~mighty observant, and subject to their masters (I can not
call them husbands), and lacked nothing but to be well in~
structed in the Christian religion, and to be legally mar-
ried ; both of which were happily brought about afterward
by my means, or at least in consequence of my coming
among them.

HAVING thus given an account of the colony in general,
and pretty much of my runagate Englishmen, I must say
something of the Spaniards, who were the main body of
the family, and in whose story there are some incidents
also remarkable enough. ~ '
I had a great many discourses with them about their
circumstances when they were among the savages. They
told me readily that they had no instances to give of their
application or ingenuity in that country ; that they were a
poor, miserable, dejected handful ofpeopie ; that even if
means had been put into their hands, yet they had so
abandoned themselves to despair, and were so sunk under
the weight of their misfortune, that they thought of noth-
ing but starving. One of them, a grave and sensible man,
told me he was convinced they were in the wrong ; that it
was not the part of wise men to give themselves up to their
misery, but always to take hold of the helps which reason
offered, as well for present support as for future deliver-
ance : he told me that grief was the most senseless, insig-

things past, which were generally impossible to be recalled
or to be remedied, but had no views of things to come, and
had no share in anything that looked like deliverance, but
354 ROBINSON cansott.
upon this he repeated a Spanish proverb, which, though I
can not repeat in the same words that he spoke it in, yet I
remember I made it into an English proverb of my own
thus : a
"In trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your nouble doubled.”
He then ran on in remarks upon all the little improve~
ments I had made in my solitude : my unwearied applica-
tion, as'he called it; and how I had made a condition,

theirs,la thousand times more happy than theirs was, even
now when they were all together. He told me it was re-
' markable that Englishmen had a greater presence of mind
in their distress than any people that ever he met with;
that their unhappy nation and the Portuguese were the
worst men in the world to struggle with misfortunes ; for

were over, was to despair, lie down under it, and die, with-
out rousing their thoughts up to the proper remedies for
escape.
I told him their case and mine differed exceedingly; that
they were cast upon the shore without necessaries, without
supply of food, or present sustenance till they could pro-
wide for it ', that, it was true, I had this further disadvan-


tage and discomfort, that I was alone ; but then the sup-
plies I had providentially thrown into my hands, by the
unexpected driving of the ship on shore, was such a help
as would have encouraged any creature in the world to
have applied himself as I have done. “ Senor,” says the
Spaniard, “had we poor Spaniards been in your case, we
should never have got half those things out of the ship, as
you did : nay," says he, “we should never- have found
means to have got a raft to carry them, or to have got the
raft on shore without boat or sail; and how much less
should we have done if any of us had been alone !” Well,
I desired him to abate his compliments, and go on with
the history of their coming-0n shore, where they landed.
He told me they unhappily landed at a place where there
were people without provisions; whereas, had they had the
common sense to put off to sea again, and gone to another
island a little further, they had found provisions, though
without people: there being an island that way, as they
had been told, where there were provisions, though no
people—that is to say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had

and hogs at several times, where they had bred in such
multitudes, and where turtle and sea-fowlsvwere in such

though they had found no bread; whereas, here they were
only sustained with a few roots and herbs, which they
understood not, and which had no substance in them, and
which the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough; and
they could treat them no better, unless they would turn ‘

They gave me an, account how many ways they strove
to civilize the savages they were with, and to teach them
rational customs in the ordinary way of living, but in vain;
and how they retorted upon them as unjust that they win
came there for assistance and support should attempt to
set up for instructors to those that gave them food ; inti-
mating, it seems, that none should set up for the instruct-
ors of others but those who could live without them.
They gave me dismal acetiunts of the extremities they
were driven to; how sometimes they were many days with-
out any food at all, the island they were upon being inhab-
ited by a sort of savages that lived more indolent, and for
that reason were loss supplied with the necessaries of life,
than they had reason to believe others were in the same
part of the world : and yet they found that these savages
were less ravenous and voracious than those who had bet-
ter supplies of food. Also, they added, they could not
but see with what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness
the governing providence of God directs the events of
things in this world, which, they said, appeared in their
circumstances: for if, pressed by the hardships they were
under, and the barrenness of the country where they were
they had searched after a better to live in, they had then
been out of the way of the relief that happened to them
by my means.
They then gave me an account how the savages whom
they lived amongst expected them to go out with them

with them, had they not had the disaster to lose their
ammunition, they could have been serviceable not only to
their friends, but have made themselves terrible both to
friends and enemies ; but being without powder and shot,
and yet in a condition that they could not in reason de-

condition than the savages themselves, for they had neither
. bow nor arrows, nor could they use those the savages gave
‘ them. So they could do nothing but stand still-and be
wounded with their arrows, till they came up to the teeth
of their enemy ; and then, indeed, the three halberts they
had were of use to them; and they would oftendrive a
whole little army before them with those halberts, and
sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their muskets.
But, for all this, they were sometimes surrounded with
multitudes, and in great danger from their arrows, till at
last they found the way to make themselves large targets
of wood, which the covered with skins of wild beasts,

they thought he had keen killed; but when they afterward
heard he was taken prisoner, they were under the
greatest grief imaginable and would willingly have

They told me that when they were so knocked down,
the rest of their company rescued them, and stood over

him whom they thought, had been dead; and then they
made their way with their halberts and pieces, standing
close together in a line, through a body of above a thous-
and savages, beating down all that came in their way, got
the victory over their enemies, but to their great sorrow,
because it was with the loss of their friend, whom the
ROBINSON causos. 357
I gave an account before. They described, most affec-
tionately, how they were surprised with joy at the return
of their friend and companion in misery, who they thought
had been devoured by the wild beasts of the worst kind—
wild men; and yet, how more and more they were surprised
,with the account he gave them of his errand, and that _
there was a Christian in any place near, much more one
that was able,rand had humanity enough, to contribute to
their deliverance. _ '
They described how they were astonished at the sight
of the relief I sent them, and at the appearance of loaves
of bread—things they had not seen since their coming to
that miserable place; how often they crossed it and blessed
it as bread sent from heaven; and what a reviving cordial
it was to their spirits to taste it, as also the other things I
had sent for their supply ; and, after all, they would have
‘told me something of the joy they were in at the sight of
a boat and pilots, to carry them away to the person and
place from whence all these new comforts came. But it
was impossible to express it by words, for their excessive ,
joy naturally driving them to unbecoming extravagances,
they had no way to describe them but by telling me they
bordered upon lunacy, having no way to give vent to their
passions suitable to the sense that was upon them; that in
some it worked one way and in some another; and that
some of them, through a surprise of joy, would burst into
tears, others be stark mad, and others immediately faint.
This discourse extremely affected me, and called to my
,mind Friday’s ecstasy when he met his father, and the
poor people's ecstasy when I took them up at sea after
ROBINSON causos. 357
when he found himself delivered in the place where he
expected to perish ; and my own joy, when, after twenty-
eight years’ captivity, I found a good ship ready to carry
me to my own country. All these things made me more
sensible of the relation of these poor men, and more
affected with it.
Having thus given a view of the state of things as I
found them, I must relate the heads Of what I did for
these people, and the condition in which I left them. It
was their opinion, and mine too, that they Would be
troubled no more with the savages, or if they were, they
would be able to cut them off, if they were twice as man
as before ; so they had no concern about that. ThenI
entered into a serious discourse with the Spaniard, whom
I call governor, about their stay in the island: for as I was
not come to carry any of them off, so it would not be just
to carry off somc and leave others, who, perha s, would
be unwilling to stay if their strength was diminished. On
the other hand, I told them I came to establish them
there, not to remove them; and then I let them know that
I had brought with me relief of sundry kinds for them;
that I had been at a great charge to supply them with all
things necessary, as well for their convenience as their de-
fense;and thatI had such and such particular persons
with me, as well to increase and recruit their number, as
by the particular necessary employments which they were

in which at present they were in want.
They were all together when I talked thus to them; and
before I delivered to them the stores I had brought, I
asked them one by one, if they had entirely forgotten

them, and was so far from designing anything against the
Spaniards, that he owned they had done nothing to him
but what his own mad humor made necessary, and what
he would have done, and perhaps worse. in their case; and


that he would ask their pardon, if I desired it, for the foolish
and brutish things he had done to them, and was very will-
ing and desirous of living in terms of entire friendship
and union with them, and would do an thing that lay in
his power to convince them of it ; and] as for going to
England, he cared not if he did not go thither these twenty

giving me this assurance, that they would never have any
interest separate from one another.
Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship,
we appointed the next day to dine all together ; and, in-
deed, we made a splendid feast. I caused the ship’s
cook and his mate to come on shore and dress our dinner,
and the old cook’s mate we had on shore assisted. We
'brought on shore six pieces of good beef and four piecéS
,of pork, out of the ship’s provisions, with our punch-bowl,

to make every one of them four shirts, and, at the Span-
iard’s request, afterward made them up six ; these were
exceedingly comfortable to them, having been what they
had long since forgot the use of, or what it was to wear
them. I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I men-
tioned before, to make every one a light coat, likea frock,

for pumps, shoes, stockings, hats, etc. I can not express
what pleasure sat upon the countenances of all these
poor men when they saw the care I had taken of them, and
how well I had furnished them. They told me I was a
father to them ; and that having such acorrespondent as I
was in so remote a part of the world, it would make them
forget that they were left in a desolate place ; and they all
voluntarily engaged to me not to leave the place without
my consent. -
Then I presented to them the people I had brought
with me, particularly the tailor, the smith and the two car-
penters, all of them most necessary people, but, above all,

did; and, what was still more, he taught the women not
only how to sew and stitch, and use the ,needle, but made
them assist to make the shirts for their husbands, and for
all the rest. As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention
how useful they were; for they took to pieces all my
clumsy, imhancly things, and made clever, convenient
tables, s'tools, bedsteads, Cupboard, lockers, shelves, and
everything they wanted of that kind. But to let them see

to see Will Atkins’s basket-house, as I called it ; and they
both owned they never saw an instance of such natural in-
genuity before, nor anything so regular and so handily


built, at least of its kind : and one of them, when he saw
it, after musing a good while, turned about to me, “ I am
sure," says he, “that man has no need of us ; you need do
nothing but give him tools.
Then I brought them out all my store of tools. and gave
every man a digging-spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we
had no barrows or plows ; and to every separate place a
pick-ax, a crow, a broad-ax, and a saw ; always appointing,
that as often as any were broken or worn out,they should
be supplied without grudging out of the general stores
that I left behind. Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels,
knives, scissors. and all sorts of iron-work, they had with—
out reserve, as they required; for no man would take more
than he wanted, and he must be a fool that, would
waste or spoil them on any account whatever; and fon
the use of the smith I left two tons of unwrought iron forI
a supply.
My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them
was such, even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice
at them ; for now they could march as I used to do, with a
musket upon each shoulder, if there was occasion ; and

little advantages of situation, which also they could not
miss, if they had occasion.
I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother
was starved to death, and the maid also ; she was a sober,
well-educated, religious young woman, and behaved so in-
offensively that every one gave her a good word; she had,
indeed, an unhappy life with us, there being no woman in
the ship but herself, but she bore it with patience. After

of thriving upon my island, and considering that they had
neither business nor acquaintance in the East Indies, or
reason for taking so long a voyage, both of them came to
\ me and desired I would give them leave to remain on the
island, and be entered among my family, as they called it.
I agreed to this readily; and they had a little plot of
ground allotted to them, where they had three tents or
houses set up, surrounded with a basket-work, palisadoed
like Atkins’s, adjoining to his plantation. Their tents were
contrived so that they had each of them a room apart to
lodge in, and a middle tent like a great store-house to lay
their goods in, and to eat and drink in. And now the
other two Englishmen removed their habitation to the
same place ; and so the island was divided into three col-'
onies, and no more—viz., the Spaniards, with old Friday
3627" ROBINSON CRUSOE.
which was, in a word, the capital city, and where they had
so enlarged and extended their works, as well under as on
the outside of the bill, that they lived, thorigh perfectly
concealed, yet full at large. Never was there such a little
city in a wood, and so hid, in any part of the world ; for I
verily believe that a thousand men might have ranged the ’
island a month, and, if they had not known there was such
a thing, and looked on purpose for it, they would not have
found it. Indeed, the trees stood so thick and so close,
and grew so fast woven one into another, that nothing

cept the only two narrow entrances where they went in'
and out could be found, which was not very easy; one
' of them was close down at the water’s edge, on the side
of the creek, and it was afterward above two hundred
yards to the place; and the other was up a ladder, as
I have already described it; and they had also a large
wood, thickly planted, on the top of the hill containing
above an acre, which grew apace, and concealed the
place from all discovery there, with only one narrow place
between two trees, not easily to be discovered, to enter on
that side.
The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where there
were four families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left
there, with their wives and children ; three savages that
were slaves, the widow and the children of the English-
man that was killed, the young man and the maid, and,by
the way, we made a wife of her before we went away.
There were besides the two carpenters and the tailor,
whom I brought with me for them ; also the smith, who
was a very necessary man to them, especially as a gun-
smith, to take care of their arms; and my other man,
'whom I called Jack-of-all-trades, who was. in himself
as good almost as twenty men ; for he was not only
a very ingenious fellow, but a very merry fellow, and
before I went away we married him to the honest
Lnafid that came with the youth in the ship I mentiOned
e ore.
And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to

extensive in his charity, and exemplary in almost every-
thing he did. What then can any one say against being
very sensible of the value of such a man, notwithstanding

well as the opinion of others who shall read this, that he

under God (and at that he crossed his breast) saved my
life, but you have admitted me’to go this voyage in your
ship, and by your obliging civility have taken me into
your family, giving me an opportunity of free conversa-
tion. Now, sir, you see by my habit What my profession
is, and I guess by your nation phat yours is ; I may think
it is my duty, and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost en-
deavors, on all occasions, to bring all the souls I can to
the knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the Catholic
doctrine ; but as I am here under‘ your permission, and
in your family, I am bound, in justice to your kindness as
well as in decency and good manners, to be under your

leave, enter into any debate on the points of religion
in which we may not agree, further than you shall give '
me leave.”

without any dislike on either side, it should be his fault,
not ours.
He replied that he thought all our conversations might
be easily separated from disputes ; that it was not his
business to cap principles with every man he conversed
with; and that be rather desired me to converse with him
as a gentleman than as a religionist ; and that, if I would
give him leave at any time to discourse upon religious
subjects, he would readily comply with it, and that he did
not doubt but I would allow him also to defend his own
opinions as well as he could ; but that without my leave
he would not break in upon me with any such thing. He
told me further, that he would not cease to do all that be-

of all that was in her ; and though, perhaps, we would not
join with him, and he could not pray with us, he hoped
he might pray for us, which 'he would .do upon all occa-
sions. In this manner we conversed; and as he Was of the
most obliging, gentleman-like behaviour, so he was, if,I
may be allowed to say so, a man of good sense, and, as I
believe, 0t great learning. ‘
He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of
the many extraordinary events of it ; of many adventures
which had befallen him in the few years that he had been
abroad in the world; and particularly, it was very remark~
able, that in the voyage he was now engaged in he had the

resolved not to go to the Madeiras, but to load salt at the

no remedy in this exigence but to go with the ship, and

further of him. .
But I shall not make digression into other men's stories
which have no relation to my own; so I return to what
concerns our affairs in the island. He came to me one
morning (for he lodged among us all the while we were
upon the island), and it happened to be just when was
going to_visit the Englishmen’s colony, at the furthest
part of the island; I say, he came to me, and told me,
with a very grave countenance, that he had for two or
three days desired an opportunity of some discourse with
me, which he hoped would not be displeasing to me, be-
cause he thought it might in some measure correspond
with my general design, which was the prosperity of my
new colony, and perhaps might put it, at least more than
be yet thought it was, in the way of God's blessing;
I looked a little surprised at the last part of his dis-
course, and turning a little short, “ How, sir,” said I,
“ can it be said that we are not in the way of God's bless-
ing, after such visible assistances and deliverances as we
have seen here, and of which I have given you a large
account?” “ If you had pleased, sir,” said he, with a world
of-modesty, and yet great readiness, “to have heard me,
you would have found no room to have been displeased,
much less to think so hard- of me, that I should suggest
that you have not had wonderful assistances and deliver-
ances; and I hope, on your behalf, that you are in the way
of God’s blessing, and your design is exceeding good, and


will prosper. But, sir, though it were more so than is
even possible to you, yet there may be some among you
that are not equally right in their actions : and you know
that in the story of the children of Israel, one Achan in
the camp removed God’s blessing from them, and turned
His hand so against them, that six-and-thirty of them,
though not concerned in the crime, were the objects of
divine vengeance, and bore the weight of that punish-
ment.”
I was sensibly touched with this discourse, and told him
his inference was so just, and the whole design seemed so
sincere, and was really so religious in its own nature, that
I was very sorry I had interrupted him, and begged him to
go on; and, in the meantime, because it seemed that what
we had both to say might take up some time, I told him I
was going to the Englishmen’s plantations, and asked him
to go with me, and we might discourse of it by the way.
He told me he would the more willingly wait on me
thither, because there partly the thing was acted which he
desired to speak to me about; so we walked on, and I
pressed him to be free and plain with me in what he had
to sa .
“ \ilrfhy, then, sir," said he, “be pleased to give me leave
to lay down a few propositions, as the foundation of what
I have to say, that we may not differ in the general princi-
ples, though We may be of some differing opinions in the
practice of particulars. First, sir, though we differ in some
of the doctrinal articles of religion (and it is very un-
happy it is so, especially in the case before us, as I shall
show afterward), yet there are some general principles in
which we both agree—~that there is a God ; and that this
God having given us some stated general rules for our
service and obedience, we ought not willingly and know
ingly to offend Him, either by neglecting to do what He '
has commanded, or by doing what He has expressly for-
bidden. And let our different religions be what they will,
this general principle is readily owned by us all, that the
blessing of God does not ordinarily follow presumptuous
sinning against His command ; and every good Christian
,will be affectionately concerned to prevent any that are
under his care living in a total neglect of God and His
commands. It is not your men being Protestants, what~
ever my opinion may be of such, that discharges me from


being concerned for their souls, and from endeavoring, if
it lies before me, that they should live in as little distance
from enmity with their Maker as possible, especially if
you give me leave to meddle so far in your circuit.”
I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told him
I granted all he had said, and thanked him that he would
so far concern himself for us : and begged he would ex-
plain the particulars of what he had observed, that like
~ joshua, to 'take his own parable, I might put away the
accursed thing from us.
“Why, then, sir," says he, “I will take the liberty you
give me ; and there are three things, which, if I am right,
must stand in the way of God's blessing upon your en-
deavors here, and which I should rejoice, for your sake
and their own, to see removed. And, sir, I promise my-
self that you will fully agree with me in them all, as soon
as I name them ; especially because I shall convince you
that every one of them may, with great ease, and very
much to your satisfaction, be remedied. First, sir," says
be, “you have here four Englishmen, who' have fetched
women from among the savages, and have taken them as
their wives, and have had many children by them all, and
yet are not married to them after any stated legal manner,
as the laws of God and man require. To this, sir, I know,
you will object that there were nolclergyman or priest of
any kind to perform the ceremony ;. nor any pen and ink,
or paper, to write down a contract of marriage, and have
it signed between them. And I know also, sir, what the
Spaniard governor has told you, I mean of the agreement
that he obliged them to make when they took those
women—viz.,that they should choose them out by con-
sent, and keep separately to them ; which by the way, is
nothing of a marriage, no agreement with the women as
wives but only an agreement among themselves, to keep
them from quarreling. But sir, the essence of the sacra-
ment of matrimony (so he called it, being a Roman) con-
sists not only in the mutual consent of the parties to take
one another as man and wife, but in the formal and' legal
obligation that there is in the contract to compel the man
woman, at all times, to own and acknowledge each other ;
obliging the man to abstain from all other women, to en-
gage in no other contract while these subsist ; and on all
occasions, as ability allows, to provide honestly for them
T

and their children ; and to oblige the women to the same
or like conditions, on their side. Now, sir," says be,
these men may, when they please, ’or when occasion pre-
sents, abandon these women, disown their children, leave
them to perish, and take other women, and marry them
while these are living;” and here he added, with some
warmth, _“ How, sir, is God honored in this unlawful lib-
erty? And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavors
in this place, however good in themselves, and however
' sincere in your design, while these men, who at present
are your subjects, under your absolute gOvernment and
dominion, are allowed by you to live in open adultery?"
I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but much
more with the convincing arguments he supported it with;
but I thought to have got off my young priest by telling
him that all that part was done when I was not there; and
that they had lived so many years with them now, that if
it was adultery, it was past remedy ; nothing could be
done in it now.
“Sir,” says he, “asking your pardon for such freedom
you are right in this, that, it being done in your absence,
you could not be charged with that part of the crime; but,
"i “v
fore, under an obligation to do your utmost now to put an
end to it. You should legally and effectually marry them;
and as, sir, my way of marrying may not be easy to recon-
cile them to, though it will be effectual, even by your own
laws, so your way may be as well before God, and as valid
among men. I mean by written contract, signed by both
man and woman. and by all the witnesses present, which
all the laws of Europe would decree to be valid."
I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much
sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in his dis-
course as to his own party or church, and such true warmth
for preserving people that he had no knowledge of or re-
lation to from transgressing the laws of God. But recol-
lecting what he had said of marrying them by a written
contract, which I knew he would stand to, I returned it
back upon him, and told him I granted all that he had
said to be just, and on his part very kind ; that I would '
discourse with the men upon the point now, when I
came to them; and I knew no reason why they should
scruple to let him marry them all, which I knew wok
enough would be granted to be as authentic and Valid
in England as if they were married by one of their own
clergymen. *
I then pressed him to tell me what was the second com.
plaint which he had to make, acknowledging that I was
- ROBINSON cnuson. 369
ly for it. He told me he would use the same freedom and
plainness in the second,and hoped I would take it as well;
and this was, that, notwithstanding these English subjects
of mine, as he called them, had lived with these women
almost seven years, had taught them to speak English,
and even to read it, and that they were, as he perceived,
women of tolerable understanding, and capable of ins-
truction, yet they had not, to this hour, taught them any-
thing of the Christian religion-no, not so much as to
know there was a God, or a worship, or in what manner
God was to be served, or that their own idolatry, and wor-
shiping they knew not whom, was false and absurd. This,
he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and what God would
certainly call them to adcount for, and perhaps at last take
the work out of their hands. He spoke this very affection-
ately and warmly. _
“ I am persuaded,” says he, “ had these men lived in
the savage country whence their wives came, the savages
would have taken more pains to have brought them to be
idolators, and to worship the devil, than any of these men,
so far as I can see, have taken with them to teach the
knowledge of the true God. Now, sir," said he, “ though
I do not acknowledge your religion, or you mine, yet we
would be glad to see the devil's servants and the subjects
of his kingdom taught to know the general principles of
the Christian religion ; that they might, at least, hear of
God and a Redeemer, and of ‘the resurrection, and of a
future state-things which we all believe ; that they might,
at least, be so much nearer coming into the bosom of the
true church than they are now in the public profession of
idolatry and devil-worship.” '
I could hold no longer: I took him in my arms, and
embraced him eagerly. “ How far,” said I to him, “ have
I been from understanding the most essential part of a
Christian—viz., to love the interest of the Christian
church, and the good of other men’s souls! I scarce
have known what belongs to the being a Christian."




.
“ Oh, sir! do not say so,” replied he; “ this thing is not“
your fault." “ No,” said I; but why did I never lay it
to heart as well as you ? ” “It is not too late yet,” said
he ; “ be not too forward to condemn yourself.” ‘But
what can be done now?’ said I; you see I am going
ing away.” “Will you give me leave to talk with these
poor men about it ! ” “ Yes, with all my heart," said
I,” “and will oblige them to give heed to what you say
too." “ As to that,” said he, “ we must leave them to the
, mercy of Christ; but it is your business to assist them,
encourage them, and instruct them ; and if you give me
leave, and God His blessing, I do not doubt but the poor
ignorant souls shall be brought home to the great circle of
Christianity, if not to the particular faith we all embrace,
and that even while you stay here." Upon this I said, “I
shall not only give you leave, but give you a thousand
thanks for it."
I now pressed him for the third article in which we were
to blame. “ Why, really," says he, “ it is of the same
nature. It is about your poor savages, who are, as I may
say, your conquered subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that is,
or ought to be received among all Christians, of what
church or' pretended church soever, that the Christian
knowledge ought to be propagated by all possible means
and on all possible occasions.
our church sends missionaries into Persia, India, and
China ; and that our clergy, even of the superior sort,
willing engage in the most hazardous voyages, and the
most dangerous residence among murderers and barba-
rians, to teach them the knowledge of the true God, and
to bring them over to embrace the Christian faith. Now,
sir, you have such an opportunity here to have six- or
seven-and-thirty poor savages brought over from a state
of idolatry to the knowledge of God, their Maker and
Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pass such an occa-
sion of doing good, which is really worth the expense of a
man’s whole life.”
I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one word ,
to say. I had here the spirit of true Christian zeal for
God and religion before me. As for me, I had not so
much as entertained a thought of this in my heart before,
;and I believe I should not have thought of it : for I looked
l‘upon these savages as slaves, and people whom, had we

been sent to any country, so they had never seen their
own. I was confounded at his discourse, and knew not
what answer to make him ‘
He looked earnestly at me, seeing my confusion. “ Sir,’
say he, “ I shall be very sorry if what~ I have said gives
you any offense.” “ No, no," said I ; “ I am offended
with nobody but myself'; but I am perfectly confounded,
not only to think that I should never take any notice of
this before,.but with reflecting what notice I am able to
take of it now. You know, sir,” said I, “ what circum~
stances I am in; I am bound to the East'Indies in a ship
freighted by merchants, and to whom it would be an in-
sufferable piece of injustice to detain their ship here, the
men lying all this While at victuals and ' wages on the
0wne,rs’ account. It is true, I agreed to be allowed twelve
days here, and if I stay more, I must pay three pounds
sterling per diem demurrage ; nor can I stay upon demur-
rage above eight days more, and I have been here thir-
teen already ; so that I am perfectly unable to engage in
this work, unless I would suffer myself to be left behind
here again; in which case, if this single ship should mis-
carry in any part of her voyage, I should be just in the

which I had been so wonderfully delivered." He OWned
the case was very hard upon me as to my voyage ; but
laid it home upon my conscience whether the blessing of
saving thirty-seven souls was not worth venturing all I had
in the world for. I was not so sensible of that as he was.
I replied to him thus : “ Why. sir, it is a valuable thing,
indeed, to be an instrument in God's and to convert
thirty-seven heathens to the knowledge of Christ; but as
you are an ecclesiastic, and are given over to the work,
so it seems so naturally to fall in the way of your profession,
how is it, then, that you do not rather offer yourself to un-
dertake it than to press me to do it ?”
Upon_this he faced about just before me, as he walked
along, and putting me to a full stop, made me a very low
bow. “ I most heartily thank God and you, sir,” said he,
“for giving me so evident at call to so blessed a work;

and if you think yourself discharged from it, and
desire me to undertake it, I will most readily do it,
and think it a happy reward for all the hazards and
difficulties of such a broken, disappointed voyage as I
have met with, that I am dropped at last into so glorious
a work." '
I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke

the joy of being embarked in such a work. I paused a
considerable while before I could tell what to say to him;

and who seemed possessed of a zeal beyond the ordinary
rate of men. But after I had considered it awhile, I
asked him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he would
venture, on the single consideration of an attempt to con-
vert those poor people, to be locked up in an unplanted
island for perhaps his life,and at last not know whether he
should be able'to do them good 0 not P He turned short
upon me, and asked me what I ca led a venture. “Pray,
sir," said he, “what do you think I consented to go in
your ship to the East Indies for?" “ Nay," said I, “that
I know not, unless, unless it was to preach to the Indians."
“ Doubtless it was," said he ; “and do you think, if I can
convert these thirty-seven men to the faith of Jesus Christ,
it is not worth my time, though I should never be fetched

worth to save so many souls than my life is, or the life of
twenty more of the same profession? Yes, sir,” says he,
, “ “ I would give God thanks all my days if I could be made
the happy instrument of saving the souls of those poor
men, though I were never to get my foot off this island or
see my native country any more But since you will
honor me with putting me into this work, for which I will
pray for you all the days of my life, I have one humble
petition to you besides." “ What is that P ” said 1. “Why,”
says he, “it is, that you will, leave your man Friday
with me, to be my interpreter to them, and to assist
me ; for without some help I can not speak to them,
or they to me."
I was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because
I conld not think of parting with him, and that for many
reasons ; he had been the companion of my travels ; he
.3
was not only faithful to me, but sincerely affectionate to
the last degree ; and I had resolved to do something con-
siderable for him if he outlived me, as it was probable he
would. Then I knew that, as I had bred Friday up to be
' a Protestant, it would quite confound him to bring him to
embrace another religion ; and he would never, while his
eyes were open, believe that his old master was a heretic,
and would be damned ;and this might in the end ruin the
poor fellow’s principles, and so turn him back again to his
ROBINSON causes. 1 373
this strait, and it was this: I told him I could not say that
I was willing to part with Friday on any account what-
ever, though a work that to him was of more value than
his life ought to be of much more value than keeping or
parting with a servant. On the other hand, I was persuad-
ed that Friday would by no means agree to part with
me; and I could not force him to it without his con-
sent, without manifest injustice ; because I had promised
I would never send him away, and he had promised
andengaged that he would never leave me, unless I sent
him away.
He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had no
rational access to these poor people, seeing that he did
not understand one word of their language, nor they

When we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them all
together, and after some account given them of what I
had done for them—viz.,what necessary things I had pro-
vided for them, and how they were distributed, which
they were very sensible of, and very thankful for, I be-
gan to talk to them of the scandalous life they led, and
gave them a full account of the notice the clergyman had
taken of it ; and arguing how unchristian and irreligious

or bachelors ? They soon explained their condition to
me, and showed that two of them were widowers, and the


other three were single men, or bachelors. I asked them
with what conscience they could take these women, and
call them their wives, and have so many children by them,
and not be lawfully married to them. They all gave me
the answer I expected—Aria, that there was nobody to
marry them ; that they agreed before the governor to
keep them as their wives; and they “thought as things
stood with them, they were as legally married as if they had
been married by a parson and with all the formalities in the
World.
I told them that no doubt they were married in the
sight of God, and were bound in conscience to keep them
as their ,wives ; but that the laws of men being otherwise,
they might desert the poor women and children hereafter,
and that their wives being poor desolate women, friend-
less and moneyless, would have no way to help them-
selves. I therefore told them that unless I Was assured
of their honest intent, I could do nothing for them, but
would take care that what I did should be for the
women and children without them; and that, unless
they would give me some assurance that they would
marry the women, I could not think it was convenient
they should continue together as man and wife ; for that
it was both scandalous to men and offensive to God,
_who they could not think would bless them if they went
on thus. .
All this went on as I expected ; and they told me,
especially Will Atkins, who now seemed to speak for the
rest, that they loved their wives as well as if they had
been born in their own native country, and would not
leave them on any account whatever ; and they did verily
believe that their wives were as virtuous and as modest,
and did,to the utmost of their skill, as much for them and
for their children, as any women could possibly do; and
they would not part with them on any account. Will
Atkins, for his own particular, added, that if any man
would take him away, and offer to carry him home to
England, and make him captain of the best mah-of-war
in the navy, he would not go with him if he might not
carry his wife and children with him ; and if there was a
clergyman in the ship, he would be married to her now
, with all his heart.
" LThis was just as I would have it. The priest was not
\.
with me at that moment, but he was not far off ; so to try
him further, I told him I had a clergyman with me, an ,
if he was sincere, I would have him married next morn-
ing, and bade him consider of it, and talk with the rest.
He said, as for himself, he need not consider of it at all,
for he was very ready to do it, and was glad I had a min-
ister with me, and he believed they would be all willing
also. I then told him that my friend, the minister, was a
Frenchman, and could not speak Eng1ish,but I would
act as clerk between them. He never so much as asked
me whether he was a Papist or Protestant, which was, in-
deed, what I was afraid of. We then parted, and I went
back to my clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to
talk with his companions. I desired the French gentle-
man not to say anything to them till the business was
thoroughly ripe; and I told him what answer the men had
given me.
Before I went from their quarter they all came to me
and told me they had been considering what I had said ;
that they were glad to hearI had a clergyman in my com-
pany, and they were very willing to give me the satisfaction . i
I desired, and to be formally married as soon as I pleased;
for they were far from desiring to part with their wives,
and that they meant nothing but-what was very honest
when they chose them. So I appointed them to meet me
the next morning ; and, in the meantime, they should
let their wives know the meaning of the marriage law; and
that it was not only to prevent any scandal, but also to
oblige them that they should not forsake them, whatever
mi%ht happen.
, he women were easily made sensible of the meanin
noems'ou causes 375
they had reason to be ; so they failed not to attend all
together at my apartment next morning, where I brought
out my clergyman; and though he had not on a minister’s
gown, after the manner of England, or the habit of a
priest, after the manner of France, yet having a black
vest, something like a cassock, with a sash round it, he
did not look very unlike a minister ; and as for his lan-
guage, I was his interpreter. But the seriousness of his
ehavior to them, and the scruples he made of marrying
the women, because they were not baptised and professed
Christians, gave them an exceeding reverence for his per-
v *' *' x - xs‘x;z
son, and there was no need, after that, to inquire whether
he was a clergyman or not. Indeed, I was afraid his scru-
ples would have been carried so far as that he would not
have married them at all ; nay, notwithstanding all I was
able to say to him, he resisted me, though modestly, yet
very steadily, and at last refused absolutely to marry them,

376 ROBINSON cnvson. ‘
at last I agreed to it with a good will, perceiving the sin-
cerity of his design.
When he came to them he let them know that I had
acquainted him with their circumstances, and with the
present design ; that he was very willing to perform that
part of his function, and marry them, as I had desired ;
but that before he could do it, he must take the liberty to
talk with them. He told them that in the sight of all in-
different men, and in the sense of the laws of society, they
had lived all the while in a state of sin ; and that it was
true that nothing but the consenting to marry, or effectu-
ally separating them from one another, could now put an

Christian to a savage, an idolater, and a heathen—one
that is not baptized ;‘ and yet that he did notvsee that
there was time left to endeavor to persuade the women
to be baptized, or to profess the name of Christ, whom
they had, be doubted, heard nothing of, and without
which they could not be baptized. He told them he
doubted they were but indifferent Christians themselves ;
that they had but little knowledge of God or of His ways,
and, therefore, he could not expect that they had said
much to their wives on that head yet; but that unless
they would promise him to use their endeavors with their
wives to persuade them to become Christians, and would,
as Well as they could, instruct them in the knowledge and
belief of God that made them, and to worship JesusI
Christ that redeemed them, he could not marry them ; for
he would have no hand in joining Christians with savages,
nor was it consistent with the principles of the Chris-
tian religion, and was, indeed, expressly forbidden in
~ God’s law.
They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it
"""" W ,—— _?§r_'T_"—_?‘:‘r
very faithfully to them from his mouth, as near his own
words as I could ,' only sometimes adding something of
my own to convince them how just it was, and that I was
of his mind ; and I always very faithfully distinguished
between what I said from myself and what were the
clergyman’s words. The told me it was very true what
the gentleman said, that they were very indifferent Chris-
tians themselves,and that they had never talked to their
wives about religion. “ Lord, sir,” says Will Atkins, “how
should we teach them religion ? Why, we know nothing
ourselves ; and, besides, sir,” said he, “ should we talk to
them of God and Jesus Christ, and heaven and hell, it
would make them laugh at us, and ask us what we believe
ourselves. And if we should tell them that we believe all
the things we speak to them, such as of good people go-
ing to heaven, and wicked people to the devil, they would
ask us where we intend to go ourselves, that believe all
this, and are such wicked fellows as we indeed are? Why,

hearing ; folks must have some religion themselves before
they begin to teach other people.” “Will Atkins," said
I to to him, “though I am afraid that what you say has
too much truth in it, yet can you not tell your wife she is
in the wrong ; that there is a God, and a religion better
than her own ; that her gods are idols; that they can
neither hear nor speak ; that there is, a great Being that
made all things, and that can destroy all that He has
made ; that He rewards the good and punishes the bad;
and that we are to be judged by Him at last for all we do
here ? You are not so ignorant, but even nature itself
ROBINSON CRUSOE. ’ i 377
know it all to be true, and believe it yourself.” “ That is
true, sir,” said Atkins; “ but with what face can I say any-
thing to my wife of all this, when she will tell me im-
mediately it can not be true ? ” “ Not true ! " said I.
“ What do you mean by that ? ” “ Why, sir,” said he, f she
will tell me it can not be true that this God I shall tell her
of can be just, or can punish or reward, since I am not
punished and sent to the devil, that have been such a
wicked creature as she knows 'I have been, even to her,
and to everybody else ; and that I should be suffered to
live, that have been always acting s0 contrary to what I
must tell her is good, and to what I ought to have done."
“Why, truly, Atkins," said I, “ I am afraid thou speakest
too much truth ; ” and with that I informed the clergyman
of what Atkins had said, for he was impatient to know.
“ Oh,” said the priest, “ tell him there is one thing will
make him the best minister in the world to his wife, and
that is repentance; for nune teach repentance like true
penitents. He wants nothing but to repent, and then he

ness and long suffering ,forbears to punish those that
offend ; waiting to be gracious, and willing not the death
of a sinner, but rather he should return and live ; and even
reserves damnation to the general day of retribution ;
that is a clear evidence of God and of a future state that
righteous men receive not their reward, or wicked men
their punishment, till they come into another world ; and
this will lead him to teach his wife the doctrine of the
resurrectionand of the last judgment. La him but re-
pent himself ; he will be an excellent preacher of repen-
tance to his wife.”
I repeated all this-to Atkins, who looked very serious
all the while, and, as we could easily perceive, was more
than ordinarily affected with it; when being eager, and
hardly suffering me to make an end, “ I know all this,
master," says he, “ and a great deal more ; but I have not
the impudence to talk thus to my wife, when God and my
conscience know, and my wife will be an undeniable evi-
dence against me, that I have lived as if I never heard of
a God or a future state, or Anything about it ; and to talk
of my repenting, alas! (and with that he fetched a deep
sigh, and I could see that the tears stood in his eyes) ’tis
past all that with me.” “Past it, Atkins,” said I; “what
dost thou mean by that P" “ I know well enough what I
mean,” says he; “I mean ’tis too late, and that is too
true."
I told the clergyman, word for word, what he said, and
this affectionate man could not refrain from tears ; but
vrecovering himself, said to me, “ Ask him but one ques-
tion : Is he easy that it is too late ; or is be troubled, and
wishes it were not so P” I put the question fairly to At~
kins; and he anSWered, with a great deal of passion, “ HOW
coulo any man be easy in a condition that must certainly
end in eternal destruction? that he was far from being
easy ; but that, on the contrary, he believed it would one
time or other ruin him.” “ What do you mean by that ?"
said 1. “Why,” he said, “he believed he should one time
or other out his throat, to put an end to the terror of it.”
The clergyman shook his head, with great concern in
his face, when I told him all this; but turning quick to me
upon it, says, “ If that be his case, we may assure him it
is not too late ; Christ will give him repentance. But
pray,” says he, “ explain this to him ; that as no man is
saved but by Christ, and the merit of His passion procur-
ing divine mercy for him, how can it be too late for any
man to receive mercy? Does he think he is able to sin be»
yond the power or reach of divine mercy? Pray tell him
there may be a time when provoked mercy will no longer
strive, and when God may refuse to bear, but that it is
never too late for men to ask mercy; and we, that are
Christ's servants, are commanded to preach mercy at all
times, in the name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sin-
cerely repent; so that it is never too late to repent."
I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earn-
estness; but it seemed as if he turned off the discourse to
the rest, for he said to me he would go and have some
talk with his wife; so he went out awhile, and we talked to
the rest. D‘perceived they were all stupidly ignorant as to
matters of religion, as much as I was when I went ram-
bling away from my father; yet there were none of them
backward to hear what had been said ; and all of them
seriously promised that they would talk with their wives
about it, and do their endeavors to persuade them to turn
Christians. '
The cleryman smiled upon me when I reported what
answer they gave, but said nothing a good while ; but at
last, shaking his head, “ We that are Christ’s servants,”
says he, “can go no further than to exhort and instruct ;
and when men comply, submit to the reproof, and prom-
isewhat we ask, 'tis all we can do ; we are bound to ac-
cept their good words ; but believe me, sir,” said he,
“ whatever you may have known of the life of that man
you call Will Atkins, I believe he is the only sincere con-
vert among them; I will not despair of the rest ; but that
man is apparently struck with the sense of his past llfe'

and I doubt not, when he comes to talk of religion to his
wife, he will talk himself effectually into it ; for attempt-
ing to teach, others is sometimes the best way of teaching
ourselves. If that poor Atkins begins but once to talk
seriously of Jesus Christ to his wife, he will assuredly talk
himself into a thorough convert, make himself a penitent,
and who knows what may follow P"
Upon this discourse, however, and their promising, as
above, to endeavor to persuade their wives to embrace
Christianity, he married the two other couple; but Will
Atkins and his wife were not yet come in. After this, my
clergyman, waiting awhile, was anxious to know where
Atkins was gone, and turning to me, said: “ I entreat you,
sir, let us walk out of your labyrinth here and look ; I

talking seriously to his wife, and teaching her already
something of religion." I began to be of the same mind;
so we went out together, and I carried him a way which
none knew but myself, and where the trees were so very
thick that it was not easy to see through the thicket of
leaves, and far harder to see in than to see out ; when,
coming to the edge of the wood, I saw Atkins and his
tawny wife sitting under the shade of a bush, very eager
in discourse ; I stopped short till my clergyman came up
to me, and then having showed him where they were, we
stood and looked very steadily at them a good while. We
observed him very earnest with her, pointing up to the
sun, and to every quarter of the heavens, and then down
to the earth, then out to the sea, then to himself, then to
her, to the woods, to the trees. “ Now,” says the clergy-
man, “ you see my words are made good; the man preaches
to her ; mark him now, he is telling her that our God has
made him, her, and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the
woods, the trees, etc." “ I believe he is,” said I. Imme-
diately we perceived Will Atkins start upon his feet, fall
down on his knees, and lift up both his hands. We sup-
posed he said something, but we could not hear him ; it
was too far for that. He did not continue kneeling half
a minute, but comes and sits down again by his wife, and
talks to her again; we perceived then the woman very at-
tentive, but whether she said anything to him we could
not tell. While the poor fellow was upon his knees ,I
could see the tears run plentifully down my clergyman 5
cheeks, and I could hardly forbear myself : but it was a
great affliction to us both that we were not near enough to
hear anything that passed between them. Well, however,
we could come no nearer for fear of disturbing them ; so
we resolved to see an end of this piece of still conversa-
tion, and it spoke loud enough to us without the help of
voice. He sat down again, as I have said, close by her,
and talked again earnestly to her, and two or three times .
we could see him embrace her most passionately ; another
time we saw him take out his handkerchief and wipe her
eyes, and then kiss her again with a kind of transport very
unusual ; and after several of these things, we saw him on
a sudden jump up again, and lend her his hand to help
her up, when immediately leading her by the hand a step
or two, they both kneeled down together, and continued
so about two minutes.
My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud,
“St. Paul! St. Paul' behold he prayeth.'_’ I was afraid
Atkins would hear him, therefore I entreated him to with-
hold himself awhile, that we might see an end of the scene,
which to me, I must confess, was the most affecting that
ever I saw in my life. Well, he strove with himself for
awhile, but was in such raptures to think that the poor
heathen woman was become a Christian, that he was not
able to contain himself ; he wept several times, then
throwing up his hands and crossing his breast, said over
several things ejaculatory, and by the way of giving God
thanks for so miraculous a testimony of the success of our
endeavors. Some he spoke softly, and I could not well
hear others; some things he said in Latin, some in French;
then two or three times the tears would interrupt him,
that he could not speak at all ; but I begged that he
would contain himself, and let us more narrowly and
fully observe what was before us, which he did for a time,
the scene not being near ended yet; for after the poor
man and his wife were risen again from their knees, we
observed he stood talking still eagerly to her, and we
observed her motion, that she was greatly affected with
what he said, by her frequently lifting up her hands, lay-
ing her hand to her breast, and such other postures as ex-
press the greatest seriousness and attention; this continued
about half a quarter of an hour, and then they walked
away, so we could see no more ofihem in that situation.

was glad to see the particulars we had both been witnesses
to; that, though I was hard enough of belief in such cases,
yet that I began to think it was all very sincere here, both
in the man and his wife, however ignorant they might
both be, and I hoped such a beginning would yet have a
more happy end. “ But, my friend,” added I, “ will you

how to object the least thing against that affectionate con-
cern which you show for the turning of the poor people
from their paganism to the Christian religion; but how
does this comfort you, while these people are, in your ac-
count, out of the pale of the Catholic Church, without
which you believe there is no salvation? so that you esteem
these but heretics, as effectually lost as the pagans them-
selves.”
To this he answered, with abundance of candor, thus:
“ Sir, I am a Catholic of the Roman Church, and a priest
of the order of St. Benedict, and I embrace all the prin-
ciples of the Roman faith; but yet, if you will believe me,
and that I do not speak in compliment to you, or in re-
spect to my circumstances and your civilities; I say, never-
theless, I do not look upon you, who call yourselves re-
formed, without some charity. I dare not say (though I
know it is our opinion in general) that you can not be
saved; I will by no means limit the mercy of Christ so far
asto think that He can not receive you in to the bosom'oi
His Church, in a manner to us unperceivable; and I hope
you have the same charity for us; I pray daily for you be-
ing all restored to Christ’s Church, by whatsoever method
He, who is all-wise, is pleased to direct. In the mean-
time, surely you will allow it consists with me as a Roman
to distinguish far between a Protestant and a pagan ; be-
tween one that calls on Jesus Christ, though in a way
which I do not think is according to the true faith, and a
savage or a barbarian, that knows no God, no Christ, no
Redeemer; and if you are not within the pale of the Cath-
olic Church, we hope you are nearer being restored to it
than those who know nothing of God or of His Church ;
and Irejoice, therefore, when I see this poor man. who

it to the goodness of Christ to perfect His work in His

Sincere and Worthy Character of the Priest.—-Dialogue with Will
Atkins and Diwali—Conversation Betwixt Atkins and His Indian
Wife on the Subject of Religion—Her Baptlsm.—Settlement of the
Commonwealth.
I WAS astonished at the sincerity and temper of this
pious Papist, as much as I was oppressed by the power of
his reasoning , and it presently occurred to m thoughts,
that if such a temper was universal, we might e all Cath-
olic Christians, whatever church or particular profession
We joined in : that a spirit of charity would soon work its
all up into right principles; and as he thought that the
like charity would make us all Catholics, so I told him I
believed, had all the members of his church the like mods
eration, they would soon all be Protestants. And there
we left that part; for we never disputed at all. However,
I talked to him another way, and taking him by the hand,
“ My friend,", says I, “ I wish all the clergy of the Rom-
ish Church were blessed with such moderation, and had
an equal share of your charity. I am entirely of your
opinion ; but I must tell you that if you should preach
such doctrine in Spain or Italy, they would put you into
the Inquisition." _ “It may be so," said he : “ I know not
384 ' ' ROBINSON cRusOE. '
what they would do in Spain or Italy, but I will not saj
they would be the better Christians for that severity ; for
I am sure there is no heresy in abounding with charity.”
Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our busi-
ness there was over, so we went back our own way ; and
when we came back, we found them waiting to be called
in; observing this, I asked my clergyman if we should dis-
cover to him that we had seen him under the bush or not;
and it was his opinion we should not, but that we should
384 ' ' ROBINSON cRusOE. '
called him in alone, nobody being in the place but our-‘
selves, and I began by asking him some particulars about
his parentage and education. He told me frankly enough
that his father was a clergyman who would have taught
him well, but that he, Will Atkins, despised all instruction
and correction; and by his brutish conduct cut the thread
of all his father’s comforts and shortened his days, for
that he broke his heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural
return for the most affectionate treatment a father ever
' ave.
g In what he said there seemed so much sincerity of re-
pentance, that it painfully affected me. I could not but
reflect that I, too, had shortened the life of a good, tender
father, by my bad conduct and obstinate self-will. I was,
indeed, so surprised with what he had told me, that I
thought, instead of my going to teach and instruct him,
the man was made a teacher and instructor to me in a
most unexpected manner.
I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was
greatly affected with it, and said to me, “ Did I not say,
sir, that when this man was converted he would preach to
us all? I tell 'you, sir, if this one man be made a true
penitent, there will be no need of me ; he will make
Christians of all in the island.” But having a little com-
posed myself, I renewed my discourse with Will Atkins.
“ But, Will,” said 1, “how comes the sense of this matter
to touch you just now P"
W. A.——Sir, you have set me about a work that has
struck a dart through my very soul ; I have been talking
about God and religion to my wife, in order, as you
directed me, to make a Christian of her, and she has
preached such a sermon to me as I shall never forget
while I live.
R. C.—No, no, it is not your wife has preached to you ;
but when you were moving religious arguments to her,

W. A.—Ay, sir, with "such force as is not to be resisted.
R. C.—Pray, Will, let us know what passed between
you and your wife : for I know something of it already.
W. A.--Sir, it is impossible to give you a full accoum:
of it ; I am too full to hold it, and yet have no tongue to
express it ; but let her have said what she will, though I
can not give you an account of it, this I can tell you, that
I have resolved to amend and reform my life.
R. C.—But tell us some of it: how did you begin, Will?
For this has been an extraordinary case, that is certain.

this upon you. \

about marriage, and what the reasons were that men and
women were obliged to enter into such compacts as it was
neither in the power of one nor other to break; that other-
wise, order and justice could not be maintained, and men
would run from their wives, and abandon their children,
mix confusedly with one another, and neither families he
kept entire, nor inheritances be settled by legal descent.
R. C.—Vou talk like a civilian, Will. Could you make
her understand what you meant by inheritance and fami-
lies? They know no such thing among the savages, but
marry anyhow, without regard to relation, consanguinity,
or family ; brother and sister, nay, as I have been told, even
the father and the daughter, and the son and the mother.
W. A.——I believe, sir, you are misinformed, and 'my
wife assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it;
perhaps, for any further relations, they may not be so ex-
act as we are ; but she tells me never in the near relation-
ship you speak.
R. C.—Well, what did she say to what you told her?
W. A.—She said she liked it very well, as it was much
better than in her country.
R. C.—But did you tell her what marraige was?
W. A.—Ay, ay, there began our dialogue. I asked her
if she would be married to me our way. She asked me
what way that was ; I told her marriage was appointed b
God; and here we had a strange talk together, indee
as ever man and wife had, I believe.
N. B—This dialogue between Will Atkins and his wife,
which I took down in writing just after he told it me, was
as follows :
Wife.—~Appointed by your God! Why, have you a God
in your country ?
W. A.——Yes, my dear, God is in every country.
Wife—No your God in my country ; my country have
the great old Benamuckee God.

God is in heaven and made the heaven and the earth, the
sea, and all that in them is.
Wife—No makee de earth ; no you God makee all
earth ; no makee my country.
Will Atkins laughed a little at her expression of God
not making her country.
Wife—No laugh ; why laugh me?

W. A.——That’s true, indeed ; I will not laugh any more,
my dear.
Wife—Why you say you God makee all .P
W. A.—Yes, child, our God made the whole world, and
you, and me, and all things ; for He is the only true God,
and there is no God but Him; He lives forever in heaven.
Wife—Why you no tell me long ago?
W. A.—-—That’s true, indeed ; but I have been a wicked
wretch, and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with
anything before, but have lived without God in the world
myself.
\ Wife—What, have you a great God in your country,
you no know him? No say oh to Him? No do good
ting for Him P That no possible.
W. A.——It is true ; though, for all that, we live as if
there Was no God in heaven, or that He had no power on
earth.
Wife—But why God let you do so? Why He no makee
you good live P
W. A.——It is all our own fault.
Wife—But you say me He is great, much great, have
much great power; can makee kill when He will: why He
no makee kill when you no serve Him? no say oh to
Him? no be good mans.

W. A.—That is true, He might strike me dead ; and I
ought to expect, for I have been a wicked wretch, that is
true ; but God is merciful, and does not deal with us as
we deserve.
Wife—But then do you not tell God thankee for that
too ? r
W. A. — No, indeed, I have not thanked God for
His mercy, any more than I have feared God from His
power. _ -
Wife—Then you God no God ; me no tink, believe He
be such one, great much pOWer, strong: no makee kill you,
though you make Him much angry.
W. A.—What, will my wicked life hinder you from be-
lieving in God ? Whata dreadful creature am I ! and what
a sad truth is it, that the horrid lives of Christians hinder
the conversion of heathens!
Wife—How me tink you have great much God up
there [she points up to heaven], and yet no do well,
no do good ting? Can he tell? Sure He no tell what
you do? '
W. A,—-Yes, yes, He knows and sees all things; He
hears us speak, sees what we do, knows what we think,
though we 0 not speak.
Wife—W at ! He no hear you curse, swear, speak do
great damn?
W. A.-—Yes, Yes, He hears it all.
Wife—Where be then the much great power strong?
W. A.—He is merciful, that is all we can say for it; and
this proves Him to be the true God ; He is God, and not
man, and therefore we are not consumed.
[Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with horror to
think how he could tell his wife so clearly that God sees,
and hears, and knows the secret thoughts of the heart,
and all that we do, and yet that he had dared to do all
the vile things he had done]
Wife—Merciful i What you call dat?
W. A.—He is our Father and Maker, and He pities and I
spares us. '-

when you do wicked; then He no good Himself, or no

Wife—Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead ; what
you say to Him for that? You no tell Him thankee for
all that too?
W. A.—I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that is
true.
Wife—Why He no makee you much good better? you
say He makee you.
W. A.—-He made me as He made all the world : it is I
have deformed myself and abused His goodness, and
made myself an abominable wretch.
Wife—I wish you makee God know me. I no makee
Him angry—I no do bad wicked ting.
[Here Will Atkins said his heart sank within him to
hear a poor untaught creature desire to be taught to know
God, and he such a wicked wretch, that he could not say
one word to her about God, but what the reproach of his
own carriage would make most irrational to her to believe;
nay, that already she had told him that she could not be-
- lieve in God, because he, that was so wicked, was not de-
stroyed]
W. A.—My dear, you mean, you wish I could teach you
to know God, not God to know you ; for He knows you
already, and every thought in your heart.
Wife—Why, then, He know what I say to you now ;
He know me wish to know Him. How shall‘me know who
makee me?
W. A.--Poor creature, He must teach thee : I can
not teach thee. I will pray to Him to teach thee to
know Him, and forgive me, that am unworthy to teach
thee.
[The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring
him to make her know vGod, and her wishing to know
Him, that he said he fell down on his knees before her,


and prayed to God to enlighten her mind with the sav-
ing knowledge of Jesus Christ, and to pardon his sins,
and accept of his being the unworthy instrument of in-
structing her in the principles of religion ; after which he
sat down by her again, and their dialogue went on. This
was the time when we saw him kneel down and hold up
his hands]
Wife—What you put down the knee for? What you
hold up the hand for? What you say? Who you speak to?
What is all that P
W. A.—My dear, I bow my knees in token of my sub-
mission to Him that made me : I said oh to Him, as you
call it, and as your old men do to their idol Benamuckee;
that is I prayed to Him.
Wife—What say you oh to him for?
W. A.—I prayed to him to open your eyes and your
understanding, that you may know Him and be accepted
by Him.
Wife—Can He do that too?
W. A.—Yes, He can : He can do all things.
Wife—But now He hear what you say?
W. A.—Yes, He has bid us pray to Him, and promised
to hear us
Wife—Bid you pray! When He bid you? How He
bid you 7 What you hear Him speak ?
W. A.—No, we do not hear Him speak; but He has re-
vealed Himself in many ways to us. .
[Here he was at a great loss to make her under-
stand that God has revealed Himself to us by His Word,
and what His Word was; but at last he told it to her
thus ;
W. ]A.—God has spoken to some good men in former
days. even from heaven, by plain words ; and God has in-
spired good men by His Spirit ; and they have written all
His laws down in a book.
Wife—Me no understand that ; where is book?
W. A.—-Alas ! my poor creature, I' have not this book ;
but I hope I shall one time or other get it for you, and
help you to read it.

expressible grief that he had not a Bible]
Wife—But how you makee me know that God teachee
them to write that book?


W. A.—.By the same rule that we know him to be
God. '
Wife—What rule? What way you know Him ?
W. A.—Because He teaches and commands nothing but
what is good, righteous, and holy, and tends to make
us perfectly good, as well as perfectly happy; and be-
cause he forbids and commands us to avoid all that
is wicked, all that is evil in itself, or evil in its conse-
quence.
Wife.—-—That me would understand, that me fain see; if
He teacheeall good thing, He makee all good thing, He
give all thing, He hear me when I say oh to Him, as
you do just now; He makee me good if I wish to be good;
He spare me, no makee kill me, when I no be good ; all
this you say He do, yet He be great God ; me take, think,
believe Him to be great God; me say oh to Him With
you, my dear.
Here the poor man could forbear no longer, but raised
her up, made her kneel by him, and he prayed to God
aloud to instruct her in the knowlegde of Himself, by His
Spirit; and that by some good providence, if possible,
she might, some time or other, come to have a Bible, that
she might read the word of God, and be taught by it
to know Him. This was the time that we saw him lift
her up by the hand, and saw him kneel down by her,
as above. \ x '
They had several other discourses, it seems, after this;
and particularl she made him promise that, since be con-
fessed his own ife had been a wicked, abominable course
of provocations against God, that _he would reform it, and
not make God angry any more, lest He should make him
dead, as she called it, and then she would be left alone.
and never be taught to know this God better ; and lest he
should be miserable,as he had told her wicked men would
be after death.
This Was a strange account, and very affecting to us
both, but particularly to the young clergyman ;he was,
indeed, wonderfully surprised with it, but under the great-

that he could not speak English to make her understand
him ; and as she spoke but very broken English, he could
not understand her ; however, he turned himself to me,
and told me that he believed that there must be more to
do with this woman than to marry her. I did not unders

viz., that she ought to be baptized. I agreed with him in
that part readily, and wished it to be done presently.
“ No, no ; hold, sir,” says he ; “though I would have her
be baptized, by all means. for I must observe that Will
Atkins, her husband, has indeed brought her, in a wonder-
ful manner, to be willing to embrace a religious life, and
has given her just ideas of the being of a God; of
His power, justice, and. mercy: yet I desire to know
of him if he has said anything to her of Jesus Christ,
and 0f the salvation of sinners; of the nature of faith
in Him, and redemption by Him; of the Holy Splrit,
the resurrection, the last judgment, and the future
state.”
I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but the
the poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us
he had said something to her of all those thing, but
that he was himself so wicked a creature, and his own
conscience so reproached him with his horrid, ungodly
life, that he trembled at the apprehensions that the knowl-
edge of him should lesson the attention she should give
to those things, and make her rather contemn religion
than receive it; but he was assured, he said, that her
mind was so disposed to receive due impression of all those
things, and that if I would but discourse with her, she
would make it appear to my satisfaction that my labor
would not be lost upon her.
Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself as inter-
preter between my religious priest and the woman. I en-
{treated him to begin with her ; but sure such a sermon
Iwas never preached by a Popish priest in these latter ages
of the world ; and as I told him, I thought he had all the
'zeal, all the knowledge, all the sincerity of a Christian,
without the error of a Roman Catholic; and that I
took him to be such a clergyman as the Romam bish-
ops were before the Church of Rome assumed spiritual
soverignty over the consciences of men. In a word, he
brought the poor woman to embrace the knowledge of
Christ, and of redemption by Him, not with wonder and

but with joy and faith ; with an affection, and a surpris-
ing degree of understanding, scarce to be imagined, much

less to be expressed ; and, at her own request, she was
baptized.
When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated him

the man might not perceive he was of the Roman Church,
if possible, because of other ill consequences which might
attend a difference among us in that very religion which
we were instructing the other in. He told me that as he
had no consecrated chapel, nor proper things for the

should not know by it that he was a Roman Catholic my-
self, if I had not known it before ; and so he did ; for say-
ing only some words over to himself in Latin, which I
could not understand, he poured a whole dishful of water
upon the woman's head, pronouncing in French, very
loud, “ Mary,” (which was the name her husband desired
me to give her, for I was her godfather), “ I baptize thee
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost ; ” so that none could know anything by
it what religion he was of. Hev gave the benediction
afterward in Latin, but either Will Atkins did not know
but it was French, or else did not take notice of it at
that time.
As soon as this was over we married them; and after
the marriage was over, he turned to Will Atkins, and in a
very affectionate manner exhorted him, not only to per-
severe in that good disposition he was in, but to sup-
port the convictions that were upon him by a resolu-
tion to reform his life; told him it was in vain he re-
pented if he did not forsake his crimes; represented to
him how God had honored him with being the instru~
ment of bringing his wife to the knowledge of the Chris-
tian religion, and that he should be careful he did not dis-
honor the grace of 'God ; and that if he did, he would see
the heathen a better Christian than himself ; the savage
converted, and the instrument cast away. He said a great
many good things to them both ; and then, recommend-
ing them to God’s goodness, gave them the benediction
again, I repeating everything to them in English ;and thus
ended the ceremony. I think it was the most pleasant
and agreeableday to me that ever I passed in my whole
life. But my clergyman had not done yet: his thoughts
hung continually upon the conversion of the thirty-seven
savages, and fain he would have stayed upon the island to

dertaking was impracticable in itself ; and, secondly, that
perhaps I would put it into a way of being done in his ab-
sence to his satisfaction.
Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a narrow
compass, I was preparing to go on board the ship, when
the young man I had taken out of the famished ship’s
company-came to me, and told me he understood I had a
clergyman with me, and that I had caused the Englishmen
to be married to the savages: that he had a match too,
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 393
two Christians, which he hoped would not be disagreeable
to me. ‘
I knew this must be the young woman who was his
mother’s servant, for there was no other Christian woman
on the island : so I began to persuade him not to do any-
thing of that kind rashly, or because he found himself in
this solitary circumstance. I represented to him that he
had some considerable substance in the world, and good
friends, as I understood by himself, and the maid also;
that the maid was not only poor, and a servant, but was
unequal to him, she being six- or seven-and-twenty years
old, and he not above seventeen or eighteen ; that he
might very probably, with my assistance, make a remove
from this wilderness, and come into his own country again;
and that then it would be a thousand to one but he would
repent his choice, and the dislike of that circumstance
might be advantageous to both. I was going to say more,
but he interrupted me, smiling, and told me, with a great
deal of modesty, that I mistook in my guesses—that he
had nothing of that kind in his thoughts ; and he was very
glad to hear that I had an intent of putting them in a way
to see their own country again ; and nothing should have
made him think of staying there, but that the voyage I
was going was so exceeding long and hazardous, and
would carry him quite out of the reach of all his friends ;
that he had nothing to desire of me but that I would set-
tle him in some little property in the island where he was,
give him a servant or two, and some few necessaries, and
he would live here like a planter, waiting the good time
when, if ever I returned to England, I would redeem him.
He hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I came
to England: that he would give me some letters to his
friends in London, to let them know how good I had
been to him, and in what part of the world, and what cir.
cumstances I had left him in: and he promised me that
whenever I redeemed him, the plantation, and all the im-
provements he had made upon it, let the value be what it
would, should be wholly mine.
His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering
his youth, and was the more agreeable to me, because he
told me positively the match was not for himself. I gave,
him all pOssible assurances that if I lived to come safe to
England, I would deliver his letters, and do his business
effectually; and that he might depend I should never for-
get the circumstances I had left him ; but still Iv was im-
patient to know who was the person to be married ; upon
which he told me it was my ]ack~of-all-trades and his
maid Susan. I was most agreeably surprised when he
named the match ; for, indeed, I thought it very suitable.
The character of that man I have given already ; and as
the old maid, she was a very honest, modest, sober, and
religious young woman : had a very good share of sense,
was agreeable enough in her person, spoke very handy
somely and to the purpose, always with decency and good
manners, and was neither too backward to speak when
requisite, nor impertiuently forward when it was not her
business; very handy and housewifely, and an excellent
394 ROBINSON causes.
island; and she knew very well how to behave in every
respect.
The match being proposed in this manner, we married
them the same day ; and as I was father at the altar, and
gave her away, so I gave her a portion ; for I appointed
her and her husband a handsome large space of ground
for their plantation ; and, indeed, this match, and the pro-
posal the young gentleman made to give him a small
property in the island, put me upon parceling it out
among them, that they might not quarrel afterward about
their situation. ‘
This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins,
who was now grown a sober, grave, managing fellow, per-
fectly reformed, exceedingly pious and religious ; and, as
far as I may be allowed to speak positively in such a case,
I verily believe he was a true penitent. He divided things

so justly, and so much to every one’s satisfaction, that
they only desired one general writing under my hand for
the whole, which I caused to be drawn up, and signed and
sealed, setting out the bounds and situation of every man's
plantation, and testifying that I gave them thereby ‘sever-
ally a right to the whole possession and inheritance of the
respective plantations or farms, with their improvements,
to them and their heirs, reserving all the rest of the island
as my own property, and a certain rent for every particu-
lar plantation after eleven years, if I, or any one from me,
or in my name, came to demand it, producing an attested
copy of the same writing. As to the government and laws
among them, I told them I was not capable of giving them
better rules than they were able to give themselves ; only
I made them promise me to live in love and. good neigh<
borhood with one another ; and so I prepared to leave
them.
One thing I must not omit, and that is, that being now
settled in a kind of commonwealth among themselves, and
having much business in hand, it was odd to have seven-
and-thirty Indians live in a nook of the island, independ-
ent, and, indeed, unemployed ; for except the providing
ROBINSON eRUsoa'.‘ .395
sometimes they had no manner of business or property to
manage. I proposed, therefore, to the governor Spaniard,
that he should go to them, with Friday’s father, and pro-
pose to them to remove, and either plant for themselves,
or be taken into their several families as servants, to be
maintained for their labor, but without being absolute
slaves ; for I would not permit them to make them slaves
by force, by any means ; because they had their liberty
given them by capitulation, as it were, articles of surren-
der, which they ought not to break.
They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came
all very cheerfully along with him : so we allotted them
land and plantations, which three or four accepted of, but
all the rest chose to be employed as servants in the sev-
eral families we had settled. Thus my colony was in a
manner settled as follows: The Spaniards possessed my
original habitation, which was the capital city, and ex-
tended their plantations all along the side of the brook,
which made the creek that I have so often described, as
far as my bower; and as they increased their culture, it

went always eastward. The English lived in the north-
east part, where Will Atkins and his comrades began, and
came on southward and south-west, toward the back part
of the Spaniards ; and every plantation had a great addi-
tion of {and to take in, if they found occasion, so that
they need not jostle one another for want of room. All
the east end of, the island was left uninhabited, that if any
of the savages should come on shore there only for their
usual customary barbarities, that they might come and go,
if they disturbed nobody, nobody would disturb them:
and no doubt but they Were often ashore, and went away
again ; for I never heard that the planters were ever at-
tacked or disturbed any more.

IT now came into my thoughts that I had hinted to my
friend the clergyman that the work of converting the sav-
ages might perhaps be set on foot in his absence to his
satisfaction, and I told him that now I thought that it was
put in a fair way; for the savages, being thus divided
among the Christians, if they would but every one of them
do their part with those which came under their hands, I
hoped it might have a very good effect.
He agreed presently in that, if they did their part.
“But how,” says he, “shall we obtain that of them ?" I
told him we would call them all together, and leave it in
charge with them, or go to them one by one, which he
thought best ; so we divided it—he to speak to the Span-
iards, who were all Papists, and I .to speak to the English,
who were all Protestants; and we recommended it earn-
estly to them, and made them promise that they would
never make any distinction of Papist or Protestant in their
exhorting the savages to turn Christians, but teach them
the general knowledge of the true God, and of their Sav—
iour Jesus Christ; and they likewise promised us that they
would never have any differences or disputes one with an-
other about religion.
When I came to Will Atkins’s house, I found there the
young woman I have mentioned above, and Will Atkins's
wife, were become intimate; and this prudent, religious
young woman had perfected the work Will Atkins had be-
gun ; and though it was not aboue four days after what I
have related, yet the new-baptized savage woman was
made such a Christian as I have seldom heard of in all my
observation or conversation in the world. It came next
int0'my mind in the morning before I went to them, that
among all the needful things I had to leave with them I
had not left them a Bible, in which I showed myself less
considering for them than my good friend the widow
was for me when she sent me the cargo of a hundred
'pounds from Lisbon, where she packed up three Bibles
and a Prayer-book. However, the good woman's char-
ity had a greater extent than ever she imagined, for
they were reserved for the comfort and instruction of
those that made much better use of them them than I
had done. '
I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I
came to Will Atkins’s tent, or house, and found the young
woman and Atkins’s baptized wife had been discours-
ing of religion together—for Will Atkins told it me with
a great deal of joy_-I asked if they were together now,
and he said, “ Yes;” so I went into the house, and he
with me, and we found them together very earnest in
discourse. “ Oh, sir,” says Will Atkins, “when God has
sinners to reconcile to Himself, and aliens to bring
home, He never wants a messenger; my wife has got
a new instructor; I knew I was unworthy as I was in-
capable of that work; that young woman has been sent
hither from heaven-—she is enough to convert a whole
island of savages." The young woman blushed, and rose
up to go away, but I desired her to sit still; Itold her she
had a good work upon her hands, and I hoped God would
bless her in it.
We talked a little, and I did not perceive that they had
any book among them, though I did not ask ; but I put
my hand into my pocket, and pulled out my Bible.
“Here,” said I to Atkins," “I have brought you an
assistant that perhaps you had not before.” The man
was so confounded that he was not able to speak for
some time; but, recovering himself, he takes it with
both his hands, and turning to his wife, “Here, my
dear,” says he, “did not I tell you our God, though he
\


lives above, could hear what we have said? Here's the
book I prayed for when you and 1 kneeled down under
the bush; now God has heard us and sent it." When
he had said so, the man fell into such passionate trans-
ports that, between the joy Of having it, and giving God
thanks for it, the tears ran down his face like a child that
Was crying.
The woman was surprised, and was like to have run in-

persuaded the poor woman to have believed that an ex-
press messenger came from heaven on purpose to bring
that individual book. But it was too serious a matter
to suffer any delusion to take place, so I turned to the
young woman, and told her we did not desire to im-

ant understanding of things, and begged her to explain
to her that God may be very properly said to answer
our petitions, when in the course of His providence, such
things are in a particular manner brought to pass as we
petitioned for; but we did not expect returns from heaven
in a miraculous and particular manner, and it is a mercy it
is not so.
This the young woman did afterward effectually, so

in the world to have had it so. But the effect upon Will
Atkins is really not to be expressed, and there we may be
sure was no delusion. Sure no man was ever more thank-
ful in the world for anything of its kind than he was for
the Bible—nor, I believe, never any man was glad of a.

perately wicked, yet this man is a standing rule to us all
for the well instructing children—viz., that parents should
never give over to teach and instruct, nor ever despair of
the success of their endeavors, let the children be ever so
refractory, or to appearance insensible to instruction ; for,
if ever God in His providence, touches the conscience of
such, the force of their education returns upon them, and

man; however he was of religion and Christian knowl-
edge, he found he had some to do with now more ignor- '
ant than himself, and that the least part of the instruction
of his good father that now came to his mind was of use
to him
Among the rest, it occurred to him, he said, how his
father used to insist so much on the inexpressible value
of the Bible, and the privilege and blessing of it to nations,
families, and persons; but he never entertained the least
notion of the worth of it till now, when being to talk
to heathens, savages, and barbarians, he wanted the help
of the written oracle for his assistance. The young
woman was glad of it also for the present occasion,
though she had one, and so had the youth, on board our
ship among the goods, which were not yet brought on
shore. And now, having said so many things of this
young woman, I can not omit telling one story of her and
myself, which has something in it very instructive and re-
markable. '
I have related to what extremity the poor young woman
was reduced ; how her mistress was starved to death, and
died on board that unhappy ship we met at sea, and how
the whole ship's company was reduced to the last ex-
tremity. The gentlewoman, and her son, and this maid
ROBINSON t‘ 'lwsoz. 399
neglected and starved—that is to say, brought to the last
extremity of hunger. One day, being discoursing with
her on the extremities they suffered, I asked her if, she
could describe, by what she had felt, what it was to starve,
and how it appeared? She said she believed she could,
and told her tale very distinctly, thus :
“ First, we had for some days fared exceedingly hard,
and suffered very great hunger; but at last we were
wholly witout food of any kind except sugar, and a little

food at all, I found myself, toward evening, empty and
sick at the stomach, and nearer night much inclined to
yawning and sleep. I lay down on the couch in the great
cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, and awakcd r
little refreshed, having taken a glass of wine when I it

then sick again, with retchings to vomit. The second
night, being obliged to go to bed again without any food
more than a draught of fresh water, and being asleep, I
dreamed I was at Barbadoes, and that the market was
mightily stocked with provisions; that‘I bought some for
my mistress, and went and dined heartily. I thought my
stomach was full after this, as it would have been after a
good dinner; but when I awaked I was exceedingly sunk

The last glass of wine we had I drunk, and put sugar in
it, because of its having some spirit to supply nourish-

of the wine was to raise disagreeable fumes from the
stomach into the head; and I lay, as they told me, stupid
and senseless, as one drunk, for some time. The third
day, in the morning, after a night of strange, confused,
and inconsistent dreams, and rather dozing than sleep-
ing, I awaked ravenous and furious with hungerzand
I question, had not my understanding returned and
conquered it, whether if I had been a mother, and
had had a little child with me, its life would have
been safe or not. This lasted about three hours, during
which time I was twice raging mad as any creature in

gushed out of my nose; and the cabin-boy bringing me
a little basin, I sat down and bled into it a great deal; and
as the blood came from me I came to myself, and the

did the ravenous part of the hunger. Then I grew
sick, and retched to vomit, but could not, for I had
nothing in my stomach to bring up. After I had bled
some time I swooned, and they all believed I was
dead; but I came to myself soon after, and then had a
\
"A

most dreadful pain in my stomach not to be described
;not like the colic, but a gnawing, eager pain for
food. I took another draught of water with sugar in it;
but my stomach loathed the sugar and brought it all
up again ; then I took a draught of water without
sugar, and that stayed with me; and I lay me down
upon the bed, praying most' heartily that it would please
God to take me away ; and composing my mind in
hopes of it, I slumbered awhile, and then waking,
thought myself dying, being light with vapors from an
empty stomach. I recommended my soul then to God,
and then earnestly wished that somebody would throw me
into the sea.
“All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I
thought, expiring, but she bore it with much more patience
than I, and gave the last bit of ,bread she had left to
her child, my young master, who would not have taken it
but she obliged him to eat it ; and I believe it sayed his
life. Toward the morning I slept again, and when I
awoke I fell into a violent passion of crying, and after

ous and in a most dreadful condition; and once or twice I
was going to bite my own arm. At last I saw the basin
in which was the blood I had bled at my nose the day be-
fore ; I ran to it, and swallowed it in such haste, and such
a greedy appetite, as if I wondered nobody had taken it
before, and afraid it should be taken from me now. After

draught of water, and was composed and refreshed for
some hours after. This was the fourth day ; and thus I
kept up till toward night, when, within the compass of
three hours, I had all the several circumstances over again,
one after another—viz , sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain
in the stomach, then ravenous again, then sick, then luna-
tic, then crying, then ravenous again, and so every quar-
ter of an hour, and my strength wasted exceedingly; at
night I lay me down, having no comfort but in the hope
that I should die before morning.
“ All this night I had no sleep; but the hunger was now
turned into a disease; and I had a terrible colic and grip-
ing, by wind instead of food having found its way into the
bowels; and in this condition I lay till morning, when I


was surprised by the cries and lamentations of my young
master, who called out to me that his mother was dead. I
lifted myself up a little, for I had strength to rise, but
found she was not dead, though she was able to give very
little signs of life. _ I had then such convulsions in my
stomach, for want of some sustenance, as I can not de-
scribe; with such frequent throes and pangs of appetite as
nothing but the tortures of death can imitate ; and in this
condition I was when I heard the seamen above cry out,
‘A sail! a sail !’ and halloo and jump about as if they
were distracted. I was not able to get off from the bed,
and my mistress much less ; and-my young master was so
sick that I thought he had been expiring; so we could not
open the cabin door, or get any account what it was that
occasioned such confusion; nor had we had any conversa-
tion with the ship’s company for twelve days, they having
told us that they had not a mouthful of anything to eat in
the ship ; and this they told us afterward—they thought
we had been dead. It was this dreadful condition we
were in when you were sent to save our lives ; and how
you found us, sir, you know as well as I, and better too."
This was her own relation, and is such a distinct account
of starving to death, as, I confess, I never met with, and
was exceeding instructive to me. I am the rather apt to
believe it to be a true account, because the youth gave me
an account of a good part of it ; though I must own, not
so distinct and so feeling as the maid ; and the rather, be-
cause it seems his mother fed him at the price of her own
life; but the poor maid, whose constitution was stronger
than that of her mistress, who was in years, and a weakly
woman too, might struggle harder with it; nevertheless,‘;
she might be supposed to feel the extremity something
sooner than her mistress, who might be allowed to keep,—
the last bit something longer than she parted with any to
relieve her maid. No question, as the case is here related
if our ship or some other had not so providentially met
them, but a few days more would have ended all their
lives. I now return to my disposition of things among the

such seeds of division among them that I saw plainly, had.
I set up the sloop, and left it among them, they would,
upon every light disgust, have separated, and gone away
from one another; or perhaps have turned pirates, and so
made the island a den of thieves, instead of a plantation
of sober and religious people, as I intended it ; nor did I
leave the two pieces of brass cannon that I had on board,
or the extra two quarter-deck guns that my nephew had
provided, for the same reason. I thought it was enough
to qualify them for a defensive war against any that
should invade them, but not to set them up for an offen-
sive war, or to go abroad to attack others ; which in the
end, would only bring ruin and destruction upon them. I
reserved the sloop, therefore, and the guns, for their ser-
vice another way, as I shall observe in its place.
Having now done with the island, I left them all in

ticularly promised to send them some cattle, such as sheep,

length of our voyage, to kill them at sea, for want of hay

ing, we set sail, and arrived at the bay of All Saints in the
Brazils in about twenty-two days, meeting nothing remark~
able in our passage but this : that about three days after
we had sailed, being becalmed, and the current setting
strong to the E. N. E., running, as it were, into a bay or
gulf on the land side, we were driven something out of our
course, and once or twice our men cried out, “ Land to
the eastward ! " but whether it was the continent orislands
we could not tell by any means. But the third day,
toward evening, the sea smooth, and the weather calm, we
saw the sea, as it were, covered toward the land with some
thing very black ; not being able to discover what it was,
till after some time, our chief mate, going up the main-
shrouds, a little way, and looking at them with a perspect-
ive, cried out it was an army. I could not imagine what
he meant by an army, and thwarted him a little hastily.


“ Nay, sir,” says he, “ don’t be angry, for ’tis an army, and

you may see them paddle along, for they are coming toward
us apace.”
I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my
nephew the captain; for he had heard such terrible stories
of them in the island, and having never been in those seas
before, that he could not tell what to think of it, but said,
two or three times, we should all be devoured. I must
confess, considering we were becalmed, and the current
set strong toward the shore, I liked it the worst; however,
I bade them not to be afraid, but bring the ship to an
anchor as soon as we came so near as to know that we
must engage them. The weather continued calm, and
they came on apace toward us, so I gave orders to come
to an anchor, and furl all our sails ; as for the savages, I

close by the head and the other by the stern, and

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while
they came up with us ; but never was such a horrid sight
seen by Christians ; though my mate was much mistaken
in his calculation of their number, yet when they came up
we reckoned about a hundred and twenty-six canoes;
some of them had sixteen or seventeen men in them, and
some more, and the least six or seven. When they came
nearer to us, they seemed to be struck with wonder and

presently set up a kind of fence, like waste boards, to
cover them from the arrows of the savages, if they should
shoot again. ‘
About half an hour afterward they all came up in a
body astern of us, and so near that we could easily discern
what they were, though we could not tell their design ;
and I easily found the were some of my old friends, the
same sort of savages t at I had been used to engage with.
In a short time more they rowed a little further out to sea,
till they came directly broadside with us, and then rowed
dOWn straight upon us, till they came so near that they
could hear us speak ; upon this, I ordered all my men to
keep close, lestt ey should shoot anymore arrows, and made
all our guns ready ; but being so near as to be within hear-
ing, I made Friday go out upon the deck, and call out
aloud to them in his language, to know what they meant.
Whether they understood him or not, that I knew not; but
as soon as he had called to them, six of them, who were

from us, and stooping down, ShOWed us their naked backs;

very glad if I could have overset every canoe there, and
drowned every one of them.
I can neither tell how many we killed nor how many we
wounded at this broadside, but sure such a fright and
hurry never were seen among such a multitude ; there
were thirteen or fourteen of their canoes split and overset
in all, and the men all set a-swimming: the rest, frightened
out of their wits, scoured away as fast as they could, tak-
ing but little care to save those whose boats were split or
spoiled with our shot; so I suppose that many of them
were lost; and our men took up one poor fellow swimming
for his life, above an hour after they were all gone. The
small shot from our cannon must needs kill and wound a
great many; but, in short, we never knew how it went with
406 ROBINSON CRUSOE.
abouts we could not see above three or four straggling
canoes, nor did we ever see the rest any more ; for a
breeze of wind springing up the same evening, we weighed
and set sail for the Brazils.
We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was so sul-
len that he would neither eat nor speak, and we all fancied
he would starve himself to death. But I took a way to
cure him: for I had made them take him and turn him in-
to the long-boat, and make him believe they would toss
him into the sea again, and so leave him where they found
him, if he would not speak ; nor would that do, but they
really did throw him into the sea, and came away from
him. Then he followed them, for he swam like a 005k,
and called to them in his tongue, though they knew not
one word of what he said ; however, at last they took him
in again, and then he began to be more tractable: nor did
I ever design they should drown him.
We were now under sail again, but I was the most dis-
consolate creature alive for want of my man Friday, and
wOuld have been very glad to have gone back to the island
to have taken one of the rest from thence for my occasion
but it could not be: so we went on. We had one prisoner,
as I have said, and it was a long time before we could
make him understand anything, but, in time, our men
taught him some English, and he began to be a little
tractable. Afterward, we inquired what country he came
from; but could make nothing of what he said; for his
speech was so odd, all gutturals, and he spoke in the
throat in such a hollow, odd manner that we could never
form a. word after him;and we were all of the opinion
that they might speak that language as well if they were
gagged as otherwise; nor could we perceive that they had
any occasion either for teeth, tongue, lips, or palate, but
formed their words just as a hunting-horn forms a tune,
with an open throat. He told us, however, some time after,

come up to us. He said, “ To makee te great wonder

also those of Africa, when they learn English, always add
two e's at the end of words where we use one; and they
place the accent upon them, as makée, takée, and the like;
nay, I could hardly make Friday leave it off, though at
last he did.
And now I name the poor fellow'once more, I must take
my last leave of him. Poor honest Friday! We buried
him with all the decency and solemnity possible, by put-

ROBINSON CRUSOE. - 409
me there was a certain very honest fellow, a Brazil planter
of his acquaintance, who had fallen into the displeasure of
the church. “ I know not what the matter is with him,"
says he, “ but, on my conscience, I think he is a heretic in
his heart, and he has been obliged to conceal himself for
fear of the Inquisition.” He then told me that he would
be very glad of such an opportunity to make his escape,
with his wife and two daughters ; and if I would let them
go to my island, and allot them a plantation, he
would give them a small stock to begin with—for the

estate, and he had nothing left but a little household stuff
and two slaves ; "and," adds he, “ though I hate his
principles, yet I would not have him fall into their hands,
for he will be assuredly burned alive if he does." I
granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with
them: and we concealed the man, and his wife and daugh-
ters, on board our ship, till the sloop put out to go to sea;
and then having put all their goods on board some time
before, we put them on board the sloop after she was get
out of the bay. Our seaman Was mightily pleased with
this new partner ; and their stocks, indeed, were much
alike, rich in tools, in preparations, and a farm—but noth-
ing to begin with, except as above: however, they carried
over with them what was worth all the rest, some materi-
als for planting sugar-canes, with some plants of canes,
which he, I mean the Brazil planter, understood very well.
Among the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants in
the island, I sent them by the sloop three milch coWs and

sows, two mares, and a stone-horse. For my Spaniards
according to my promise, I engaged three Brazil Women
to go, and recommended it to them to marry them, and
use them kindly. .I could have procured more women,
but I remembered that the poor persecuted man had two

though in another country. All this cargo arrived safely,
and, as you may easily suppose, was very welcome to my
old inhabitants, who were now, with this addition, between
sixty and seventy people, besides little children, of which
there were a great many. I found letters at London from
them all, by the way of Lisbon, when I came back to
England.
I have now done with the island, and all manner of
discourse about it : and whoever reads the rest of my
memorandums would do well to turn his thoughts entirely
from it, and expect to read of the follies of an /old man,

men, to beware; not cooled by almost forty years’ miseries

I HAD no, more business to go to the East Indies than a

and desire him to lock him up among the prisoners there,
and starve him. Had I taken a small vessel from Eng-
land and gone directly to the island ; had I loaded her, as
I did the other vessel, with all the necessaries for the
plantation, and for my people; taken a patent from the

stayed there myself, I had at least acted like a man of
common sense. But I was possessed of a wandering spirit
and scorned all advantages: I pleased myself with being
the patron of the people I placed there, and doing for
them in a kind ofhaughty, majestic way, like an old patri-
archal monarch, providing for them as if I had been father
of the whole family,as well as of the plantation. But I
never so much as pretended 'to plant in the name of any
government or nation, or to acknowledge any prince, or to
call my people subjects to any one nation more than an-
other: nay,‘ I never so much as gave the place a name, but
left it as I found it, belonging to nobody, and the people

or other, further than .voluntary consen ' moved them to'
comply. Yet even this, had I stayed there, would have done
well enough; but as I rambled from them, and came there no
more, the last letters I had from any of them were by my
partner’s means, who afterward sent another sloop to the
place, and who sent me word, though I had not the letter
till I got to London, several years after it was written, that
they went on but poorly, were discontented with their long

Spaniards were come away ; and though they had not been
much molested by the savages, yet they had had some
skirmishes with them; and that they begged of him to
write to me to think of the promise I had made to fetch
them away, that they might see their country again before
they died.
But I was gone on a wild-goose chase, indeed! and
they that will have any more of me must be content to

wild adventures, wherein the justice of Providence

think it would be our utmost happiness to be allowed
to possess. ' Whether I had business or no business,
away I went ; it is no time now to allow to enlarge upon
the reason or absurdity of my own conduct, but to come
to the history—I was embarked for the voyage, and the
voyage I went.
I shall only add a Word or two concerning my honest
Popish clergyman—for let their opinion of us, and all
other heretics in general, as they call us, be as uncharitable
as it may, I verily-believe this man was very sincere,
and wished the good of all men : yet I believe he used
reserve in many of his expressions, to prevent giving me '
offense; for I scarce heard him once call on the Bles-
sed Virgin, or mention St. ]ago, or his guardian angel,
though so common with the rest of them. However, I
say I had not the least doubt of his sincerity and pious

to visit even the poor Tartars and Laplanders,lwhere they
have nothing to give them, as well as covet'to flock to
India, Persia, China, etc., the most wealthy of the heathen
countries ; for if they expected to bring no gains to their
church by it, it may well be admired how they came to
admit the Chinese Confucius into the calendar of the
Christian saints. .
A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon, my pious priest
asked me leave to go thither; being still, as he observed,
41 2 ROBINSON CRUSOE,
it had been for me if I had gone with him. But it was
too late now; all things Heaven appoints for the best; had
I gone with him I had never had so many things to
be thankful for, and the reader had never heard of the
second part of the travels and adventures of Robinson
Crusoe : so I must here leave exclaiming at myself,
and go on with my voyage. From the Brazils we made
directly over the Atlantic Sea to the Cape of Good Hope,
and had a tolerably good voyage, our course generally
south-east, now and then a storm, and some contrary
winds; but my‘disasters at sea were at an end—my future
rubs and cross events were to to befall me on shore, that
it might appear the land was as well' prepared to be our
scourge as the sea.
Our shin was on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo
on board, who was to direct all her motions after she
arrived at the Cape, only being limited to a certain num-
ber of days for stay, by charter-party, at the several ports
she was to go to. This was none of my business, neither
did I meddle with it ; my nephew, the captain, and the
supercargo'adjusting all those thing between them as they

knew we were at war with France, I had some apprehen-
sions of them ; but they went their own way, and we heard
no more of them.
I shall not pester the reader with a tedious description
of places. journals of our voyage, variations of the compass,
latitudes, trade-winds, etc.; it is enough to name the ports
and places which we touched at, and what occurred to us

and bows, which they use with inconceivable dexterity, yet
we fared very well with them awhile. They treated us

such as knives, scissors, etc., they brought us eleven good
fat bullocks, of a middling size, which we took in, partly
for fresh provisions for our present spending, and the rest
to salt for the ship‘s use. .
We were obliged to stay here some time after we had
furnished ourselves with provisions ; and I, who was
always too curious to look into every nook of the world
wherever I came, went on shore as often as I could. It
was on the east side of the island that we went on shore
one evening; and the people, who, by the way, are very
numerous, came thronging about us, and stood gazing at
us at a distance. As we had traded freely with them, and
had been kindly used, we thought ourselves in no danger;
but when we saw the people, we out three boughs out of
a tree, and stuck them up at a distance from us ; which it
seems, is a mark in that country not only of a truce and
friendship, but when it is accepted the other side set up
three poles or boughs, which is a signal that they accept
the truce too ; but then this is a known condition of the
truce, that you are not to pass beyond their three poles
toward them, nor they to come past your three poles
toward you ; so that you are perfectly 'secure within the
three poles, and all the space between your poles and

truce is at an end.
It happened one evening, when we went on shore, that
a greater number ofytheir people came down than usual,

toys as we had; the women also brought us milk and roots,
and several things very acceptable to us, and all was
quiet ; and we made us a little tent or but of some
boughs or trees, and lay on shore all night. I know not

lie on shore as the rest ; and the boat riding at an anchor
at about a stone’s cast from the land, with two men in her
to take care of her, I made one of them come on shore ;
and getting some boughs of_ trees to cover us also in the
boat, I spread the sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay
under the cover of the branches of the trees all night in
the boat.
About two o’clock in the morning we heard one of our
men making a terrible noise on the shore, calling out, for
God’s sake to bring the boat in, and come and help them,
for they were all like to be murdered ; at the same time I

guns they had, and that three times over; for it seems the
natives here were not so easily frightened with guns as the
savages were in America, where I had to do with them.
All this while I knew not what was the matter, but rous-
ing immediately from sleep with the noise, I caused the
boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with three fusees we had
on board, to land and assist our men. We got the boat
soon to ,the shore, but our men were in too much haste ;
for being come to the shore, they plunged into the water,
to get to the boat with all the expedition they could, being
pursued by between three and four hundred men. Our

enough too, three of them being very ill wounded; and


that which was still worse was, that while we stood in the
boat to take our men in, we were in as much danger as
they were in on shore; for they poured their arrows in
upon us so thick that we were glad to barricade the side of
the boat up with the branches, and two or three loose
boards, which, to our great satisfaction, we had by mere
accident in the boat. And yet, had it been daylight, they
are, it seems, such exact marksmen, that if they could
have seen but the least part of any of us, they would have
been sure of us. We had, by the light of the moon, a
little sight of them, as they stood pelting us from the shore

we gave them a volley, that we could hear, by the cries of
some of them, had wounded several; however, they stood
thus in battle array on the shore till break of day, which
we supposed was that they might see the better to take
their aim at us.
In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh
our anchor, or set up our sail, because we must needs stand
up in the boat, and they were as sure to hit us as we were
to hit a bird in a tree with small shot. We made signals
of distress to the ship, and though she rode a league off,

toward the shore, pretty well understood us; and weighing
anchor with all speed, he stood as near the shore as he
durst-with the ship, and then sent another boat, with ten
hands' in her, to assist us. We called to them not to come
too near, telling them what condition we were in; however,
they stood in near to us, and one of the men taking the
end of a tow-line in his hand, and keeping me boat be-
tween him and the enemy, so that they could not perfectly
see him, swam on board us, and made fast the line to the
boat: upon which we slipped out a little cable, and leaving
our anchor behind, they towed us out of reach of the
arrows ; we all the while lying close behind the barricade
we had made. As soon as we were got from between the
ship and shore, that we could lay her side to the shore,
she ran along just by them, and poured in a broadside
among them, loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small
bullets, and such stuff, besides the great shot, which‘made
a terrible havoc among them.
When we were got on board, and out of danger, we had
in.
time to eXamine into the occasion of this fray; and, indeed,
our supercargo, who had been often in those parts, put me
upon it; for he said'he was sure the inhabitants would not
have touched us after we had made a truce, if we had not
done something to provoke them to it. At length it came
out that an old woman, who had come to sell us some
milk, had brought it within our poles, and ayoung woman
with her, who also brought some roots or herbs; and while
the old woman (whether she was mother to the young .
woman or no they could not tell) was selling us the milk,
one of our men offered some rudeness to the girl that was
with her, at which the old woman made a great noise:
however, the seaman would not quit his prize, but carried
her out of the old woman's sight among the trees, it being
almost dark ; the old woman went away without her, and,
as we may suppose, made an outcry among the people she
came from; who, upon notice, raised that great army upon ,
us in three or four hours, and it was great odds but we
had all been destroyed. _
One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him
just at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the
tent they had made; the rest came off free, all but the
fellow who was the occasion of all the mischief, who paid
dear enough for his brutality, for we could not hear what
became of him for a great while. We lay upon the shore
two days after, though the wind presented, and made sig-
nals for him, and made our boat sail up shore and down
shore several leagues, but in vain ; so we were obliged to
give him over; and if he alone had suffered for it, the loss
had been less. I could not satisfy myself, however, with-
out venturing on shore once more, to try if I could learn
anything of him or them ; it was the third night after the
action that I had a great mind to learn, if I could by any
means, what mischief we had done, and how the game
stood on the Indians’ side. I was careful to do it in the
dark, lest we should be attacked again: but I ought, in-
deed, to have been sure that the men I went with had been
under my command, before I engaged ,in a thing so
hazardous and mischievous as I was brought into by it,
without design.
We took twenty as stout fellows with us as any in the
Shlp, besides the supercargo and myself, and we landed
two hours before midnight, at the same place where the

marks behind them of the mischief we had done them,
and I thought if we could surprise one or two of them,
perhaps we might get our man again, by way of exchange.
We landed without any noise, and divided our men into
two bodies, whereof the boatswain commanded one and I
the other. We neither saw nor heard anybody stir when
we landed : and we marched up, one body at a distance r

made them halt awhile; for knowing by the circumstances
that they were at the place where the Indians had stood,
they waited for my coming up there. We concluded to
halt till the moon began to rise, which we knew would be
in less than an hour, when we could easily discern the
havoc we had made among them. We told thirty-two
bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not quite dead;
some had an arm, and some a leg shot off, and one his
head ; those that were wounded, we supposed, they had
carried away. When we had made, as I thought, a full
discovery of all we could come to the knowledge of, I re-
solved on going on board ; but the boatswain and his
party sent me word that they were resolved. to make a
visit to the Indian town, where these dogs, as they called
_them, dwelled, and asked me to go along with them ; and

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well
enough what answer to have given them; for I should
have commanded them instantly on board, knowing it was

loading in our charge, and a voyage to make which de-
pended very much upon the lives of the men ; but as they
sent me word they were resolved to go, and only asked
me and my company to go along with them, I positively
refused it, and rose up, for I was sitting on the ground, in
order to go to the boat. One or two of the men began to
importune me to go; and when I refused, began to grumble,
and say they were not under my command, and they
would go. “ Come, Jack,” says one of the men, “ will you
go with me? I’ll go for one." Jack said he would—land
then another—and, in a word, they all left me but one,
whom I persuaded to stay, and a boy left in the boat.
So the supercargo and I, with the hired man, went back
to the boar, where we told them we would stay for them,
and take care to take in as many of them as should be
left; for I told them it was a mad thing, they were going
about, and supposed most of them would have the fate
of Tom Jeffry. ‘
They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they
would come off again, and they would take care, etc; so
away they went. I entreated them to consider the ship
and the voyage, that their lives were \not their own, and
that they were intrusted with the voyage, in some meas-
ure; that if they miscarried, the ship might be lost for
want of their help, and that they could not answer for it
to God or man. But I might as well have talked to the
mainmast of the ship: they were mad upon their journey;
only they gave .me good words, and begged I would not
be angry; that they did not doubt but they would be back
again in about an hour at furthest; for the Indian town,
they said, was not above half a mile off, though they found
it above two miles before they got to it.
Well, they all went away, and though the attempt was
desperate, and such as none but madmen would have gone
about, yet, to give them_their due, they went about it as
warily as boldly; they were gallantly armed, for they had
every man a fuse or musket,a bayonet, and a pistol; some
of them had broad cutlasses, some of them had hangers,
and the boatswain and two more had pole-axes; besides
all which they had among them thirteen hand grenadoes.
Bolder fellows, and better provided, never went about
any wicked work in the world. When they went out their
chief design was plunder, and they were in mighty hopes

made devils of them all. ,
When they came to the few Indian houses which they
thought had been the town, which was not above half a
mile off, they were under great disappointment, for there
were not above twelve or thirteen houses, and where the
town was, or how big. they knew not. They consulted,
therefore, what to do, and were some time before they
could resolve; for if they fell upon these, they must cut
all their throats; and it was ten to one but some of them
might escape, it being in the night; though the moon was
up; and if‘ one escaped he would'run and raise all the
'town, so they should have a whole army upon them; on
the other hand, if they went away and left those un-
touched, for the people were all asleep, they could not tell
which way to look for the town: however the last was the
best advice, so they resolved to leave them, and look for
the town as well as they could. They went on a little
way, and found a cow tied to a tree; this, they presently
concluded, would be a good guide to them; for, they said,
the cow certainly belonged to the town before them, or the
town behind them, and if they untied her, they could see
which way she went; if she went back, they had nothing
tp say to her;'but if she went forward, they would follow
\her. 'So they cut the cord, which was made of twisted

They did so, and desperately resolved that they would

before the rest, called out aloud to them, and told them
that they had found Tom Jeffry: they all ran up to the
place, where they found the poor fellow hanging up naked
by one arm, and his throat cut. There was an Indian

thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and the
supercargo, what would become of us; and at last, though
he could ill spare any more men, yet not knowing what
exigence we might be in, he took another boat, and with
thirteen men and himself came ashore to me.
He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the
boat with no more than two men; and though he was glad
that we were well, yet he was in the same impatience with
us to know what was doing; for the noise continued; and

to know what had- happened, or their concern for the
safety of the men; in a word, the captain told me he
would go and help his men, let what would come. I
argued with him, as I did before with the men, the 'safety
of the ship, the danger of the Voyage, the interest of the
owners and merchants, etc.. and told him I and the two
men would go, and only see if we could at a distance learn
what was likely to be the event, and come back and tell
him. It was in vain to talk to my nephew, as it Was to
talk to the rest before ; he wonld go it, he said ; and he

back, six men should keep the two boats, and six more
come after us; so that he left only sixteen men in the ship;

of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda, in Ireland, and kill-

Tilly sacking the city of Magdeburg and cutting the throats
of twenty-two thousand of all sexes ; but I never had an

would; accordingly, as I came back to my men, I told
them my resolution, and commanded them to follow me,
when, at the very moment, came four of our men, with
the boatswain at their head, roving over heaps of bodies
they had killed, all covered with blood and dust, as if they
wanted more people to massacre, when our men hallooed
to them as loud as they could halloo ; and with
much ado one of them made them hear, so that they
knew Who we were, and came up to .us.
As soon as the boatswain saw us he set up a halloolike
a shout of triumph, for having, as he thought, more help
come ; and, without waiting to hear me, “ Captain,” says
he, “ noblelcaptain ! I am glad you are come, we have not
half done yet. Villainous, hell-hound dogs ! I’ll kill as
many of them as poor Tom has hairs upon his head : we
have sworn to spare none of them; we’ll rodt out the very
nation of them from the earth ;” and thus he ran on, out
_of breath, too, with action, and would not give us leave to
speak a word. At last, raising my voice, that I might
silence him a little, “ Barbarous dog ! ” said I, “ what are
you doing P I won’t have one creature touched more,
upon pain of death ; I charge you, upon your life, to stop
your hands, and stand still here, or you are a dead
man this minute." “ Why, sir," says he, “ do you
know what you do, or what they have done? If you
want a reason for what we have done, corne hither ; ” and
with that he showed me the poor fellow hanging with his
throat cut.
I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time
would have been forward enough; but I thought they had
carried their rage too far, and remembered jacob's words
to his sons Simeon and Levi : “ Cursed be their anger, for

had now a new task upon my hands ; for when the men I
carried with me saw the sight, as I had done, I had as
much to do to restrain them as I should have done with
the others ; nay, my nephew himself fell in with them, and
told me, in their hearing, that he was only concerned for
fear of the men being overpowered ; and as to the peo-
ple, he thought not one of them ought to liVe ; for they
had all glutted themselves with the murder of the poor
'man, and that they ought to be used like murderers. Upon
these words, aWay ran eight of my men, with the boatsWain
and his crew, to complete their bloody work ; and I, see-
ing it quite out of my power to restrain them, came away
pensive and sad ; for I could not bear the sight, much less
the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell
into their hands. ‘
I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo
and two men, and with these walked back to the boat. It

about forty men armed with lances and bows at the little
place where the twelve or thirteen houses stood mentioned
before ; but by accident I missed the place, and came di-
rectly to the sea side, and by the time I got to the sea-side

I was very angry with my nephew, fhe captain, and,
indeed, with all the men, but with him in particular, as
well for,his acting so out of his duty, as commander of
the ship, and having the charge of the voyage upon him,
as in his prompting, rather than cooling, the rage of his
blind men in so bloody and cruel an enterprise. My nephal
ew answered me very respectfully, and told me that when
he saw the body of the poor seaman whom they had mur-
dered in so cruel and barbarous a manner he was not
master of himself, neither could he govern his passion;
he owned he should not have done so, as he was com-
mander of the ship; but as he was a man, and nature
moved him, he could not bear it. As for the rest of the
men, they were not subject to me at all, and they knew it
well enough; so they took no notice of my dislike. The
next day we set sail, so we never heard any more of it.
Our men differed in the account of the number of men
they had killed; but,according to the best of their ac-
counts, all put 'together, they killed or destroyed about
426 ' \ ROBINSON cavsol.
and left not a house standing in the town. ' As for the
poor fellow Tom Jeffry, he was quite dead (for his th oat
was so cut that his head was half off), it would do hi no
service to bring him away; so they only took him down
from the tree, where he was hanging by one hand.
However just our men thought this action, I was against
them in it, and I always, after that time, told them God
would blast the voyage; for I looked upon all the blood
they shed that night to be murder in them. For though
it is true that they had killed Tom Jeffry, yet Jeffry was
the aggressor, had broken the truce, and had ill-used a
young woman of theirs, who came down to them inno-
cently, and on the faith of the public capitulation.
The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were
' afterwards on board. He said it was true that we seemed
to break the truce, but really did not; and that the war
was begun the night before by the natives themselves,
who had shot at us, and killed one of our men without
any just provocation; so that as we were in a capacity to
426 ' \ ROBINSON cavsol.
selves justice upon them in an extraordinary manner; that
though the poor man had taken a little liberty with the
girl, he ought not to have been murdered, and that in
such a villianous manner; and that they did nothing but
\

what was just and what the laws of God allowed to be
done to murderers. One would think this should have
been enough to have warned us against going on shore
among heathens and barbarians, but it is impossible to
make mankind wise but at their own expense, and their
experience seems to be always of most use to them when
it is dearest bought.
We were now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and from
thence to the coast of Coromandel, only to touch at Surat;
but the chief of the supercargo's design lay at the Bay of
, Bengal; where, if he missed his business outward bound,
he was to go out to China, and return to the coast as he

on the Arabian side of the gulf, were surrounded by the
Arabians, and either all killed orcarried away into slavery;
the rest of the boat's crew were not able to rescue them;
and had but just time to get off their boat. I began to
upbraid them with the just retribution of Heaven in this
case; but the boatswain very warmly told me, he thought
I went further in my censures than I could show any war-
rant for in Scripture; and referred to Luke xiii, 4, where
our Saviour intimates that those men on whom the Tower
of Siloam fell were not sinners above all the Galileans; but

called it, though our men could not bear to hear the word

' But my _frequent preaching to them on this subject had
worse consequences than I expected; and the boatswain,
who had been the head of the attempt, came up boldly to

account, and himself in particular; that as I was but a
passenger, and had no command in the ship, or concern
in the voyage, they were not obliged to bear it; that they
did not know but I might have some ill design in my
head, and perhaps to call them to an account for it when
they came to England; and that therefore, unless I would
resolve to have done with it, and also not to concern my-
self any further with him, or any of his affairs, he would
leave the ship; for he did not think it safe to sail with me
among them.
I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and
then told him that I confessed I had all along opposed
the massacre of Madagascar, and that I had, on all occa-
sions, spoken my mind freely about it, though not more
upon him than any of the rest; that as to having’no com-
mand in the ship, that was true; nor did I exercise any
authority, only took the liberty of speaking my mind in
things which publicly concerned us all; and what concern
I had in the voyage was none of his business; that I was
aconsiderable owner in the ship. In that claim I con-
ceived I had a right to speak even further than I had
done, and would not be accountable to him or any one
else, and began to be a little warm with him. He made
but little reply to me at that time, and I thought the
affair had been over. We were at this time in the road
at Bengal; and being willirg to seethe place, I went on
shore with the supercargo in the ship's boat to divert my-
self; and toward evening was preparing to go on board,
when one of the men came to me, and told me he would
not have me troubl; myself to come down to the boat,
for they had orders not to carry me on board any more.
Any one may guess what a surprise I was in at so inso-
lent a message; and I asked the man who bade him
deliver that message to me. He told me the cockswain.
I immediately found out the supercargo, and told him
the story, adding that I foresaw there would be a mutiny
in the ship; and entreated him to go immediately on board
and acquaint the captain of it. But I might have spared
this intelligence, for before I had spoken to him on shore
the matter was effected on board. The boatswain, the
428 ROBINSON causes.
as I was gone off in the boat, came up, and desired to
speak with the captain; and then the boatswain, making a
long harangue, and repeating all he had said to me, told
the captain that as I was now gone peaceably on shore,
they were loath to use any violence with me, which, if I
had not gone on shore, they would otherwise have done,

to tell him that as they shipped themselves to serve in the
ship under his command, they would perform it well and
faithfully; but if I would not quit the ship, or the captain
oblige me to quit it, they would all leave the ship, and
sail no further with him; and at that word all he turned
his face toward the mainmast, which was, it seems, a
signal agreed on, when the seamen, being got together
there, cried out, “ One and all! one and all!”
My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of
great presence of mind; and though he was surprised, yet
he told them calmly that he would consider of the matter;
but that he could do nothing in it till _he had spoken to
me about it. He used some arguments with them, to
show them the unreasouableness and injustice of the thing
—but it was all in vain; they swore, and shook hands
round before his face, that they would all go on shore
unless he would engage to them not to suffer me to come
any more on board the ship. ,
This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obliga-
tion to me, and did not know how I might take it. So he
began to talk smartly to them; told them that I was a
very considerable owner of the ship, and that if ever they
came to England again it would cost them very dear; that
the ship was mine, and that he could not put me out of
it; and that he would rather lose the ship, and the voyage
too, than disoblige me so much; so they might do as they
pleased. However, he would go on shore and talk with
me, and invited the boatswain to go with-him, and per-
haps they might accommodate the matter with me. But
they all rejected the proposal, and said they would have
nothing to do with me any more; and if I came on board
they Would all go on shore. “Well,” said the captain,
“ if you are all of this mind, let me go on shore and talk
with him.” So away he came to me with this account, a
little after the message had been brought to me from the
,cockswain. '

then I had been stripped naked in a remote country, hav-
ing nothing to help myself; in short, I had been in a worse
case than when I was alone in the island. But they had
not come to that length, it seems, to my satisfaction; and
when my nephew told me what they had said to him, and
how they had sworn and shook hands that they would,
one and all, leave the ship if I was suffered to come on
board; I told him he should not be concerned at it at all,
for I would stay on shore. I only desired he would take
care and send me all my necessary things on shore, and

ed to their importunity, and had sent for his goods on
board the ship, so that the matter was over in a few hours,
the men returned to their duty, and I began to consider
what course I should steer.
I was now alone in a most remote part of the world,
for I was nearly three thousand leagues by sea further off
from England than I was at my island; only, it is true, I
might travel here by land over the Great Mogul’s country
to Surat, might go from thence to Bassora by sea, up the
Gulf of Persia, and take the way of the caravans, over
the desert of Arabia to Aleppo and Scanderoon; from
thence by sea again to Italy, and so overland into France.
I had another way before me, which was to wait for some
English ships, which were coming to Bengal from Achin,
on the island of Sumatra, and get passage on board them
for England. But as I came hither without any concern

to the purser, whom he engaged to go with me, and the
other was his own servant. Then I took a good lodging
in the house of an English woman, where-several mer-
chants lodged, some French, two Italians, or rather Jews,
and one Englishman. Here I stayed about nine months,
considering what course to take. I had some English
goods with me of value, and a considerable sum of money;
my nephew furnishing-me with a thousand pieces of eight,
and a letter of credit for more, if I had occasion, that I
might not be straitened, whatever might happen. I quick-
ly disposed of my goods to.advantage; and, as I origin-
ally intended, I bought here some very good diamonds,

which, of all other things, were the most proper for me
in my present circumstances, because I could always
carry my whole estate with me. \
During my stay here many proposals were made for my
return to England, but none falling out to my mind, the
English merchant who lodged with me, and whom I had
contracted an intimate acquaintance with, came to me one
morning saying: “Countryman, I have a project to com-
municate, which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, for
aught I know, suit with yours also, when you shall have
thoroughly considered it. Here we are posted, you by
accident and I by my own choice, in a part of the world
very remote from our own country; but it is a country
where, by us who understand trade and business, a great
deal of money is to be got. If you will put one thousand
pounds to one thousand pounds, we will hire a ship here,

I’ll be merchant, and we'll go a trading voyage to China;

it seemed to be expressed with such good will. In my

a proposal for trade, or indeed anything else. I might
perhaps say with some truth, that if trade was not my ele-
ment, rambling was; and no proposal for seeing any part
of the world which I had never seen before could possibly
come amiss to me. It was, however, some time before
we could get a ship to our minds, and when we had got a
vessel, it was not easy to get English sailors—that is to
say, so many as were necessary to govern the voyage and
manage the sailors which we should pick up there. After
some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a gunner,
English ; a Dutch carpenter, and three foremast' men.
With these we found e could do well enough, having
Indian seamen, such as they were, to make up.

the Company send into India, and the merchants which
generally stay there, get such very great estates as they do,
and sometime comes home worth sixty or seventy thousand
pounds at a time; but it is little matter for wonder when we
consider the innumerable ports and places where they have
a free commerce; indeed, at the ports where the English
ships come there is such great and constant demands for

an insight into the method of getting more, that had I
been twenty years younger, I should have been tempted
to have stayed here, and sought no further for making
any fortune ; but what was all this to a man upward of
threescore, that was rich enough, and came abroad more
in obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world than
a covetous desire of gaining by it? A restless desire it
really was, for when I was at home I was restless to go
abroad ; and when I was abroad I was restless to be at
home. I say, what was this gain to me? I was rich
enough already, nor had I any uneasy desires about get-

thought I might say I had seen all the world that was worth

But my fellow-traveler and I had different notions ; I
acknowledge his were the more suited to the end of a
merchant’s life ; who, when he is abroad upon adventures,
is wise to stick to,that, as the best thing for him, which he __
is likely to get the most money by. On the other hand,
mine was the notion of a mad, rambling boy, that never
cares to see a thing twice over. But this was not all ; I
\had a kind of impatience upon me tobe nearer home, and


yet an unsettled resolution which way to go. In the in-

upon the search for business, proposed another voyage
among the Spice Islands, to bring home a loading of
cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts.
We were not long in preparing forthis voyage; the chief

better than walking about here, like a man with nothing

A LITTLE while after this there came in a Dutch ship
from Batavia; she was a coaster, not an European trader,
of about two hundred tons burden; the men, as they pre-
tended. having been so sickly that the captain had not
hands enough to go to sea with, so he lay by at Bengal;
and having, it seems, got money enough, or being Willing,
for other reasons, to go for Europe, he gave public notice
he would sell his ship. This came to my ears before my
new partner heard of it, and I had a great mind to buy it;
so I went to him and told him 0 it. He considered
awhile, for he was no rash man neit er; and at last re-
e
plied, “ She is a little too big; however, we will have
her." Accordingly, we bought the ship, and agreeing
with the master, we paid for her, and took possession.
When we had done so we resolved to engage the men, if
we could, to join with those we had, 'for the pursuing our
business; but, on a sudden, they having received not their
wages, ‘but their share of the money, as we afterward
learned, not one of them was to be found; we inquired
much about them, and at length were told that they were
all gone together by land to Agra, the great city of the
Mogul’s residence, to proceed from thence to Surat, and
then go by sea to the Gulf of Persia. ‘
Nothing had so much troubled me a good while as that
I should miss the opportunity of going with them; for such
a ramble, I thought, and in such company as would both
have guarded and diverted me, would have suited mightily
with my great design; and I should have both seen the
world and gone homeward too. But I was much better

of fellows they were; for, in short, their history was that
this man they called captain was the gunner only, not the
' commander; that they had been atrading voyage, in which
they had been attacked on shore by some of the Malays,
who had killed the captain and three of his men; and that
after the captain was killed, these men, eleven in number,
having resolved to run away with the ship, brought her to
434 ROBINSON CRUSOE.
Well, let them get the ship how they would, we came
honestly by her, as we thought, though we did not, 1 con-
fess, examine into things so exactly as we ought; for we
never inquired anything of the seamen, who would cer-
tainly have faltered in their account, and contradicted one
another. Somehow or Other we should have had reason to
have suspected them; but the man showed us a bill of sale
for the ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such
name, for I suppose it was all a forgery, and called him-
self by that name, and we could not contradict him; and
withal, having no suspicion of the thing, we went through
with our bargain. We picked up some more English
sailors here after this, and some Dutch, and now we re-
solved on a second voyage to the south-east for cloves, etc.

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat

but could not discover where it was. This forced us to
inake seme port; and my partner, who knew the country
better than I did, directed the captain to put into the river
of Cambodia; for I had made the English mate, one Mr.
Thompson, captain, not being willing to take the charge
of the ship upon myself. This river lies on the north side
of the great bay or gulf which goes up to Siam. While we
were here, and going often on shore for refreshment, there
comes to me one day an Englishman, a gunner's mate on
board an English East India ship, then riding in the same
river. “ Sir,” says he, addressing me, “ you are a
stranger to me, and I to you; but I have something to tell
you that very nearly concerns you. I am moved by the
imminent danger you are in, and, for aught I see, you
have no knowledge of it.” “ I know no danger I am in.”

are a match for them? I could not conceive what he
meant; and I turned short upon him, and said : “I wish
you would explain yourself ; I can not imagine what rea-
son I have to be afraid of any of the Company’s ships, or
Dutch ships. I am no interloper. What can they have

with a better reception than this for doing you a piece of
service of such importance.” “ I can never be ungrateful,"
said I, “ for any service, or to any man that offers me any
kindness ; but it ' is past my comprehension what they
should have such a design upon me for ; however, since\
you say there is no time to be lost, and' that there is some

which I suppose you know well enough—that you were
with this ship at Sumatra ; that there your captain was
murdered by the Malays, with three of his men ; and that
you, or some of those that were on board with you, ran
away with the ship, and are since tufned pirates. This is
the sum of the story, and you will all be seized as pirates,
I can assure you, and executed with very little ceremony;
for you know merchant ships show but little law to pirates
if they can get them into their power." “ Now you speak
plain English,” said I, “ and I thank you ; and though I
know nothing that we have done like what you talk of, for
I am sure we came honestly and fairly by the ship ; yet
seeing such a work is doing, as you say, and that you seem
to mean honestly, I will be upon my guard.” “ Nay, sir,”
says he, “ do not talk of being upon your guard ; the best
defense is to be out of danger. If you have any regard
for your life and the lives of all your men, put to sea with-

length of the way ; besides, as they are. only boats, and
not ships, they will not venture to follow you far out to

been very kind in this; what shall I do to make you

make me any amends, because you may not be convinced
of the truth of it. I Will make an offer to you; I have
nineteen months' pay due to me on board the ship ‘ ,’
which I came out of England in ; and the Dutchman that
is with me has seven months’ pay due to him. If you will
make good our pay to us, we will go along with you ; if
" ROBINSON causes. 437
if we do convince you that we have saved your lives, and
the ship, and the lives of all the men in her, we will leave
the rest to you."
I consented to this readily, and went immediately on
board, and the two men with me. As soon as I came to
the ship’s side, my partner, who was on board, came out
on the quarter deck, and called to me, with a great deal
of joy, “We have stopped the leak—we have stopped the
leak P ” “ Say you so ? ” said I ; “ thank God ! but weigh
anchor, then, immediately.” “ Weigh ! ” says he ; “ what
do you mean by that? What is the matter P ” “Ask no
questions," said I, “ but set all hands to work, and weigh
without losing a minute.” He was surprised ; however,
he called the captain, and he immediately ordered the an-
chor to be got up ; and though the tide was not quite
down, yet a little land-breeze blowing, we stood out to sea.
Then.I called him into the cabin, and told him the story;
and we called in the men, and they told us the rest of it;
but‘as it took up a great deal of time, before we had done
a seaman comes to the cabin door, and called out to us

sloops, or boats, full of men. “Very well,” said I ; “ then
it is apparent there is something in it}: I then ordered
all our men to be called up, and told them there was a de-
sign to seize the ship, and take us for pirates, and asked
them if they would stand by us, and by one another ; the
men answered cheerfully, one and all, that they would
live and die with us. Then I asked the captain what way

for resist them I was resolved we would, and that to

the last drop. He said readily that the way was to-keep
them off with our great shot as long as we could, and then
to use our small arms, to keep them from boarding us ;
but when neither of these would do any longer, we would
retire to our close quarters, for perhaps they had not
materials to break open our bulkheads, or get in upon us.
The gunner had, in the meantime, orders to bring two
guns, to bear fore and aft, out of the steerage, to clear the
deck, and load them with musket-bullets and small pieces
of oldiron, and what came next to hand. Thus we made

Notwithstanding this, they came on till they were near

It was all one ; they crowded after us, and endeavored
to come under our stern, so as to board us on our quarter;
upon which, seeing they were resolute for mischief, and
depended upon the strength that followed them, I ordered
to bring the ship to, so that they lay upon our broadside;

seeing the foremost, boat crowd‘ on after us, we made

one of the three boats that followed made up to the boat
which we had disabled, to relieve her, and we could see
her take out the men. We then called again to the fore-

know what her business Was with us ; but had no answer,
only she crowded close under our stern. Upon this, our
gunner, who was a very dexterous fellow, ran out his two

easily see did a great deal of mischief among them. We

was almost split to pieces ; in particular, her rudder and a
piece of her stern was shot quite away ; so they handed
her sail immediately, and were in great disorder. To com-
plete their misfortune, our gunner let fly two guns at them
again ; where he hit them we could not tell, but we found
the boat was sinking, and some of the men already in tlm
water ; upon this, I immediately manned out our pinnaee, '
with orders to pick up some of the men if they could, and
save them from drowning, and immediately come on board
ship with them, because we saw the rest of the boats be-
gan to come up. Our men in the pinnace followed their
orders, and took up three men, one of whom was just
drowning, and it was a good while before we could recover
him. -As soon as they were on board we crowded all the
sail we could make, and stood further out to the sea ; and
‘ ‘” “ ROBINSON cnusoa. 439
they gave over their chase.
Being thus delivered from a danger which, though I
knew not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater
than I apprehended, I resolved that we should change our
course, and not let any one know whither we were going;
so we stood out to sea eastward, quite out of the course of
all European ships, whether they were bound to China or
anywhere else, within the commerce of the European na-
tions. When we were at sea we began to consult with the
two seamen, and inquire what the meaning of all this
‘ ‘” “ ROBINSON cnusoa. 439
story about the false sale of the ship and of the murder of
the captain, and also how that be, this Dutchman, and
four more, got into the woods, where they wandered about
a great while, till at length he made his escape, and swam
off to a Dutch ship, which was sailing near the shore on its
way from China.
He then told us that he went to Batavia, where two of
the seamen belonging to the ship arrived, having deserted
the rest in their travels, and gave an account that the felt
low who had run away with the ship sold her at Bengal to
a set of pirates, who were gone a-cruising in her, and that
they had already taken an English ship and two Dutch
ships very richly laden. This latter part we found to con-
cern us directly, though we knew it to'be false; yet, as my
partner said, very justly, if we had fallen into their hands,
and they had had such a prepossession against us before-
hand, it had been in vain for us to have defended our-
selves, or to hope for any good quarter at their hands;
especially considering that our accusers had been our
judges, and that we could have expected nothing from
them but what rage would have dictated and an ungov-
erned passion have executed. Therefore it washis opinion
we should go directly back to Bengal, from whence we
came, without putting in at any port whatever—became
there we could give a good account of ourselves, could
prove where we were when the ship put in, of whom we
bought her, and the’like, and what was more than all the
rest, if we were put upon the necessity of bringing it be-
fore the proper judges, we should be sure to have some
440 ' Roamsosr :RusoE. '
I was some time of my partner’s opinion; but after a
little more serious thinking, I told him I thought it was a
very great hazard for us to attempt returning to Bengal,
for that we were on the wrong side of the Straits of Ma-
lacca, and that if the alarm was given, we should be sure
to be waylaid on every side—that ifv we should be taken,
as it were, running away, we should even condemn our-
selves, and there would want no more evidence to destroy
us. I also asked the English sailor’s opinion, who said he
was of my mind, and that we should certainly be taken.
This danger a little startled my partner and all the ship’s
company, and we immediately resolved to go away to the
coast of Tonquin, and so on to the coast of China—and
440 ' Roamsosr :RusoE. '
other to dispose of the ship, and come back in seme of the
vessels of the country, such as we could get. This was
approved of as the best method for our security; and ac-

winds, when we came that distance from the shore, seemed
to be more steadily against us, blowing almost trade, as we
call it, from the E. and E.N.E., so that we were a long
while upon our voyage, and we were but ill provided with
victuals for so long a run; and what was still worse, there
was some danger that those English and Dutch ships whose
boats pursued us, whereof some were bound that way,
might have got in before us, and if not, some other ship
bound to China might have information of us from them,
and pursue us with the same vigor.
I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought my-,
self, including the late escape from the long-boats, to have
been _in the most dangerous condition that ever I was in
through my past life; for whatever ill circumstances I had
been in, I was never pursued for a thief before; nor had I
ever done anything that merited the name of dishonest or

enemy, or, as I may rightly say, I had been nobody’s
enemy but my own; but now I was wofully embarrassed;
for though I was perfectly innocent, I was in no condition
to make that innocence appear; and if I had been taken, it
had been under a supposed guilt of the worst kind. This
made me very anxious to make an escape, though which
way to do it I knew not, or what port or place we could
go to. My partner endeavored to encourage me by de-
scribing the several ports of that coast, and told me he
would put in on the coast of Cochin China, or the bay of
Tonquin, intending afterward to go to Macao, where a
great many European families resided—and particularly
,the missionary priests, who usually went thither in order
to their going forward to China.
Hither then we resolved to go; and, accordingly, though
after a tedious course, and very much straitened for pro-
visions, we came within sight of the coast very early in
ROBINSON cnusoa. 441
of danger we were in, we resolved to put into a small river,
which, however, had depth enough of water for us, and to
see if we could, either, overland or by the ship's pinnace,,
come to know what ships were in any port thereabouts.
This happy step was, indeed, our deliverance, for though
we did not immediately see any European ships in the Bay
of Tonquin, yet the next morning there came into the bay
two Dutch ships; and a third without any colors spread
out, but which we believed to be a Dutchman, passed by
at about two leagues’ distance, steering for the coast of
China; and in the afternoon went by two English ships
steering the same course; and thus we thought we saw
ourselves beset with enemies both one way and the other.
The place we were in was wild and barbarous—the people
thieves by occupation ; and though, it is true, we had not
much to seek of them, and, except getting a few pro-
visions, cared not how little we had to do with them, yet
“3 ROBINSON CRUSOL
from being insulted by them several ways. We were in a
small river of this country, within a few leagues of its
utmost limits northward ; and by our boat we coasted
north-east, to the point Of land which opens the great bay
of Tonquin ; and it was in this beating up along the shore
that we discovered we were surrounded with enemies. The
people we were among were the most barbarous of all
the inhabitants of the coast; and among other customs
they have this one : that if any vessel has the misfortune
to be shipwrecked upon their coast, they make the men
all prisoners or slaves ; and it was not long before we
found a spice of their kindness this way, one the occasion
following.
I have observed above that our ship sprung a leak at

Situation. I
THE inhabitants came wondering down the shore to
look at us ; and seeing the ship lie down on one side in
such a manner, and heeling in toward the shore, and not
seeing our men, who were at work on her bottom with
stages, and with their boats on the Off-side, they presently
concluded that the ship was cast away, and lay fast on the
ground. On this supposition they came about us‘in two
or three hours’ time with ten or twelve large boats, having
some of them eight, some ten men in a boat, intending,
no doubt, to have come on board and plundered the ship,
and, if they found us there, to have carried us away for
slaves.
When they came up to the ship, and began to row round
her, they discovered us all hard at work on the outside of
the ship"s bottom and side,~washing, and graving, and
stopping, as every seafaring man knows how. They stood
for awhile gazing at us, and we, who were a little sur-
prised, could not imagine what their design was; but being
willing to be sure, we took this opportunity to get some of
us into the ship, and others to hand down arms and am-
munition to those that were at work, to defend themselves
with if there should be occasion. And it was no more
than need; for in less than a quarter of an hour’s consul-
tation, they agreed, it seems, that the ship was really a
wreck, and that we were all at work endeavoring to save
her, or to save our lives by the help of our boats; and
when we handed our arms into the boat, they concluded,
by that act, that we were endeavoring to save some of our
goods. Upon this, they took it for granted we all be-
longed to them, and away they came directly upon our
men, as if it had been in a line of battle.
Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be fright-
,ti*~' nosmson cRUsoa. 443
out to us to know what they should do. I immediately
called to the men that worked upon the stages to slip them
down, and get up the side into the ship, and bade those in
the boat to row round and come on board. The few who
were on board worked with all the strength and hand we
had to bring the ship to rights; however, neither the men
upon the stages nor those in the boats could do as they
' were ordered before the Cochin Chinese were upon them,
when two of theirboats boarded ourlong-boat, and began
to lay hold of the men as their prisoners.

than I could teach him, for he grappled the Pagan, and
dragged him by main force out cf their boat into ours,
where, taking him by the ears, he beat his head so against
the boat’s gunnel that the fellow died in his hands. In
the meantime, a Dutchman, who stood next, took up the
musket, and with the butt-end of it so laid about him,

thirty or forty men, who, fearless because ignorant of
their danger, began to throw themselves into the long-

the {OllQwing incident, which deserved our laughter, gave
our men a complete victory.
Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of
the ship, as well as to pay the seams where he had calked
her to stop the leaks, had got two kettles just let down
“4 nosmsorr cansep
with rosin, tallow, and oil, and such stuff as the ship-
wrights use for that work; and the man that attended the
carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand, with which
he supplied the men that were at work with the hot stuff.
Two of- the enemy’s men entered the boat just where this
fellow stood in the fore-sheets; he immediately saluted
them. with a ladle full of the stuff, boiling hot, which so
burned and scalded them, being half naked, that they

“Well done, Jack, give them some more of it,” and step-

was never better pleased with a victory in my life; not
only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and that our dan-
ger was imminent before, but as we got this victory with-
out any bloodshed, except of that man the seaman killed
with his naked hands, and which I was very much con-
cerned at. Although it may be a just thing, because
necessary (for there is no necessary wickedness in nat-
ure), yet I thought it was a sad sort of life, when we must
be always obliged to be killin our fellow-creatures to
preserve ourselvesd—and, indee , I think so still; and I
would even now suffer a great deal rather than I would
take away the life even of the worst person injuring me;
and, I believe all considering people, who know the value
of life, would be of my opinion, if they entered seriously
into the consideration of it. _
All the while this was doing, my partner and I, who
had managed the rest of the men on board, had with great
dexterity brought the ship almost to rights, and having
got the guns into their place again, the gunner called to

about sixteen hogs,on board two days before, we resolved
to stay here no longer, but go forward, whatever came of
it ; for we made no doubt but we should be surrounded
the next day with rogues enough, perhaps more than our
pitch~kettle would dispose of for us. We therefore got
all our things on board the same evening, and the next
morning were ready to sail; in the meantime, lying at
anchor at some distance from the shore, we were not so

ing our ship was perfectly healed of all her leaks, we set
sail. We would have gone into the Bay of Tonquin, for
we wanted to inform ourselves of what was to be known
concerning the Dutch ships that had been there ; but we
durst not stand in there, because we had seen several
ships go in, as we supposed, but a little before; so we kept
on N. E. toward the island of Formosa, as much afraid of
being seen by a Dutch or English merchant ship as a
Dutch or English merchant ship in the Mediterranean in
of an Algerine man-of-war.
When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. E., as if
we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine Islands ;
and this we did that we might not fall into the way of any
of the European ships ; and then we steered north till we
came to the latitude of twenty-two degrees thirty seconds,
by which means we made the island of Formosa directly,
where we came to an anchor, in order to get water and
fresh provisions, which the people there, who are very
courteous in their manners, supplied us with willingly, and
dealt very fairly and punctually with us in all their agree-

other people, and may be owing to the remains of Chris-
tianity which was once planted here by a Dutch missionary
of Protestants, and it is a testimony of what I have
often observed—viz., that the Christian religion always
civilizes the people, and reforms their manners, where it
is received, whether it works saving effects upon them
or no.
From thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of
China at an equal distance, till we knew we were beyond
all the ports of China where our European ships usually
come; being resolved, if possible, not to fall into any of
their hands, especially in this country, where, as our cir-
cumstances were, we could > not fail of being entirely

come at ; and standing in for the shore, a boat came off
two leagues to us with an old Portuguese pilot on board,
who, knowing us to be a European ship, came off to offer
his services, which, indeed, we were glad of, and took him
on board; upon which, without asking us whither we would
go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and sent it back. I
thought it was now so much in our choice to make the old
man carry us whither we would, that I began to talk to
him about carrying us to the Gulf of Nankin, which is the
most northern part of the coast of China.‘ The old man
said he knew the Gulf of Nankin very well ; but smiling,
asked us what we would do there. I told him we would
sell our cargo and purchase China wares, calicoes, raw
silks, tea, wrought silks, etc.; and so we would return by
the same course we came. He told us our best port would
have been to put in at Macao, where we could not have
failed of a market for our opium to our satisfaction, and
might for our money have purchased all sorts of China
goods as cheap as we could at Nankin.
Not being able to' put the old man out of his talk, of
which he was very opinionated or conceited, I told him we
were gentlemen as well as merchants, and that we had a
mind to go and see the great city of Pekin, and the famous
court of the monarch of China. “Why, then,” says the
old man, “you should go to Ningpo, where, by the river

stream, which goes through the heart of that vast empire!
of China, crosses all the rivers, passes some considerable
hills, by the help of sluices and gates, and goes up to
the city of Pekin, being in length near two hundred
and seventy leagues." “Well,” said I. “ Senor Portu-
guese, but that is not our business now; the great
question is, if you can carry us up to the city of
Nankin, from whence we can travel to Pekin after-
ward?" He said he could do so very well, and that
there was a great Dutch ship gonea up that way just '
before. This gave me a little shock, for a Dutch ship
was now our terror, and we had much rather have
met the devil, at least if he had not come in too fright-

parts being of great burden, and of much greater force

The old man found me a little confused, and under some
concern when he named a Dutch ship, and said to me ;
“ Sir, you need be under no apprehensions of the Dutch;
I suppose they are not now at war with your nation__?"l
“No,” said I, “that’s true ; but I know not what liberties
men may take when they are out of the reach of the laws
of their own country." “ Why,” says he, “ you are nQ
pirates ; what need you fear? They will not meddle with
peaceable merchants, sure." These words put me into
the'greatest disorder and confusion imaginable ; nor was
it possible for me to conceal it so, but the old man easily
perceived it.

vice I can." Upon tiiis we fell into further discourse, in
which, to my alarm and amazement, he spoke of the villain;
ous doings of a certain pirate ship that had long been the
talk of mariners in those seas ; no other, in a word, than
the very ship he was now on board of, and which we had
so unluckily purchased. I presently saw there was no
help for it but to tell him the plain truth, and explain all
the danger and trouble we had suffered through this mis-
adventure, and, in particular, our earnest "wish to be
speedily quit of the ship altogether ; for which reason we
had resolved to carry up to Nankin.
The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us
we were in the right to go away to the north ; and that,'if
he might advise us, it should be to sell the ship in China,
which we might well do, and buy or build another in the
country; adding, that I should meet with customers enough
for the ship at Nankin, that a Chinese junk would serve
me very well to go back again ; and that herwould procure
me people both to buy one and sell the other. “Well,
but, senor," said I, “ as you say they know the ship so
well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your measures, be instrus
mental to bring some honest, innocent men into a terrible

not the men that first went off with the ship,but innocent-
ly bought her for their trade ; and I am persuaded they
will so far believe me as at least to act more cautiously for
the time to come ”
In about thirteen days’ sail we came to an anchor, at
the south-west point of the great Gulf of Nankin ; where I
learned by accident that two Dutch ships were gone the
length before me, and that I should certainly fall into
their hands. I consulted my partner again in this
exigency, and he was as much at loss as I was. I then
asked the old pilot if there was no creek or harbor which
I might put. into and pursue my business with the Chinese
privately, and be in no danger of the enemy. He told me
if I would sail to the southward about forty-two leagues,
there was a little port called Quinchang, where the fathers
of the mission usually landed from Macao, on their prog-
ress to teach the Christian religion to the Chinese, and
where no European ships ever put in ; and if I thought to
put in there, I might consider what further course to take
when I was on shore. He confessed, he said, it was not a
place for merchants, except that at some certain times
they had a kind of fair there, when the merchants from
Japan came over thither to buy Chinese merchandises.
The name of the port I may perhaps spell wrong, having
lost this, together with the names of many other places set
down in a little pocket-book, which was spoiled by the
water by an accident ; but this I remember, that the
Chinese merchants we corresponded with called it bya
different name from that which our Portuguese pilot gave
it, who pronounced it Quinchang. As we were unanimous
in our resolution to go to this place, we weighed the next
day, having only gone twice on shore where we were, to
get fresh water; on both which occasions the people of the
country was very civil, and brought abundance of pro-
visions to sell to us; but nothing without money.
We did not come to the other port (the wind being

resolving, and my partner too, that if it was possible to

that unhappy vessel. Indeed, I mus-t acknowledge that
of all the circumstances of life that ever I had any ex-
perience, nothing makes mankind so completely miser-
able as that of being in constant fear. Well does the
Scripture say, “ The fear of man brings a snare;" it is a
life of death, and the mind is so entirely oppressed by it,
that it is capable of no relief.
Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy, by
heightening every danger; representing the English and
Dutch captains to be men incapable of hearing reason, or
of distinguishing between honest men and rogues; or be-
tween a story calculated for our own turn, made out of
nothing, on purpose to deceive, or a true, genuine ac-
count of our whole voyage, progress, and design; for we
might many ways have convinced any reasonable creatures
that we were not pirates; the goods we had on board, the
course we steered, our frankly showing ourselves, and en-
teringinto such and such ports; and even our very man-
ner, the force we had, the number of men, the few arms,
the little ammunition, short provisions; all these would
have served to convince any man that we were no pirates.
The opium and other goods we had on board would make
it appear the ship had been at Bengal. The Dutchman
who, it was said, had the names of all the men that were
in the ship, might easily see that we were a mixture of
English, Portuguese, and Indians, and but two Dutchmen
on board. These, and many other particular circum-
stances, might have made it evident to the understanding
of any commander whose hands we might fall into that
we were no pirates.
But fear, that blind, useless passion, worked another
way, and threw us into the vapors; it bewildered our un-
derstandings, and set the imagination at work to form a
thousand terrible things that perhaps might never happen.

that the seamen on board the English and Dutch ships,
but especially the Dutch, were so enraged at the name of
pirate, and especially at our beating off their boats and
escaping, that they would not give themselves leave to
inquire whether we were pirates or no, but would execute
us off-hand, without giving us any room for a defense.

Another apprehension I had was the cruel usage we might

confess to crimes they never were guilt of, or own them-

us to death with a formal appearance of justice; and that

appearing all smooth and plain; and truly it was 50' they
were all like men who, _had a load taken off their hacks.
For my part, I had a weight taken off from my heart that
it was not able any longer to bear; and, as I said above,
we resolved to go no more to sea in that ship. When we
came on shore, the old pilot, who was now our friend, got
us a lodging, together with a warehouse for our goods; it
was a little but, with a larger house adjoining to it, built
and also palisaded round with cane, to keep out ilferers,
of which‘there were not a few in that country; however,
the magistrates allowed us a little guard, and we had a
soldier with a kind of half pike, who stood sentinel at our.
door; to whom we allowed a pint of rice and a piece of
money about the value of threepence per day, so that our
goods were kept very safe. '
The fair or mart usually kept at this place had been
over some time; however, we found that there were three
or four junks in the river, and two ships from Japan, with
goods which they had bought in China, and were not gone
away, having some Japanese merchants on shore.

who were in the town, and who had been there sometime

tians when they had done. One of these was a tench-
man, whom they called Father Simon ; another was a
,Portuguese; and the third a Genoese. Father Simon was
courteous, and very agreeable company; butthe other two
were more reserved, seemed rigid and austere, and a plied
seriously to the work they came about—viz., to talk with
and insinuate themselves among the inhabitants wherever
they had opportunity. We often eat and drank with those
men; and though,'I must confess, the conversion, as they
call it, of the Chinese to Christianity, is so far from the
true con-version required to bring heathen people to the
faith of Christ that it seems to amount to little more than
letting them know the name of Christ, and say some
prayers to the Virgin Mary and her Son, in a tongue which
they understood not, and to cross themselves, and the like;
yet it must be confessed that the religionists, whom we

be saved, and that they are the instruments of it ; and on
this account they undergo not only the fatigue of the voy-
age, and the hazards of living in such places, but often-
times death itself, and the most violent tortures, for the
sake of this work.
Father Simon was appointed, it seems, by order of the
chief of the mission, to go up to Pekin, and waited only
for another priest, who was ordered to come to him from
Macao, to go along with him. We scarce ever met to-
gether but he was inviting me to go that journey ; telling
me how he would show me all the glorious things of that
mighty empire, and, among the rest, Pekin, the greatest
city in the world. “ A city,” said he, “that your London _
and our Paris put together can not be equal to." But as
I looked on those things with different eyes from other
men, so I shall give my opinion of them in a few words,
when I come in the course of my travels to speak more
particularly of them. /
Dining with Father Simon one day, and being very
merry together, I showed some little inclination to go with
him ; and he pressed me and my partner very hard to con-
sent. “ Why, father," says my partner, “ should you de-
sire our company so much? you know we are heretics, and
you do not love us, nor can not keep us company with any
pleasure." “ Oh," says he, “you may perhaps be good
Catholics in time: my business here is to convert heathens,
and who knows but I may convert you too ? " “ Very well,
father," said I, “ so you will preach to us all the way? "
“ I will not be troublesome to you," says he; “ our religion
does not divest us of good manners ; besides, we are here
like countrymen ; and so we are, compared to the place
we are in ; and if you are Huguenots, and I a Catholic, we
may all be Christians at last; at least, we are all gen-
tlemen, and we may converse so without being uneasy
to one another." I liked this part of his discourse very
well, and it began to put me in mind of my priest that
I had left in the Brazils ; but Father Simon did not
come up to his character by a great deal; for though
this friar had no appearance of a criminal levity in him,
yet he had not that fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and
sincere affection to religion that my other good ecclesias-
tic had.
But to leave him a little, though he never left us, nor
solicited us to go with him, we had something else before

chandise to dispose of, and we began to be very doubtful
what we should do, for we were now in a place of very lit-
tle business. Once I was about to venture to sail for the
river of Kilam, and the city of Nankin ; but Providence
seemed now more visibly, as I thought, than ever to con-
cern itself in our affairs ; and I was encouraged, from this
very time, to think I should, one way or other, get out
of this entangled circumstance, and be brought home to
my own country again, though I had not the least view of
the manner. Providence, I say, began here to clear up

our old Portuguese pilot brought a Japan merchant to us
ROBINSON cnvsos. 455
he bought all our opium, and gave us a very good price
for it, paying us in gold by weight, some in small pieces
of their own coin, and some in small wedges of about ten
or twelve ounces each. While we were dealing with him
for our opium, it came into my head that he might per-
haps deal for the ship too, and I ordered the interpreter
to propose it to him. He shrunk up his shoulders at it
ROBINSON cnvsos. 455
he came to me, with one of the missionary priests for his
interpreter, and told me he had a proposal to make to me,
which was this : he had bought a great quantity of our
goods, when he had no thought of proposals made to him
of buying the ship ; and that, therefore, he had not money
to pay for the ship ; but if I would let the same men who
were in the ship navigate her, he would hire the ship to
go to Japan ; and would send them from thence to the
Philippine Islands with another loading, which he would
pay the freight of before they went from Japan; and that
at their return he would buy the ship. I began to listen
to his proposal, and so eager did my head still run upon
rambling, that I could not but begin to entertain a notion
of going myself with him, and so to set sail from the
Philippine Islands away to the South Seas; accordingly, I
asked the Japanese merchant if he would not hire us to the


Phillippine Islands and discharge us there. He said no,
he could not do that, for then he could not have the re-
t r: of his cargo ; but he would discharge us in Japan, at
the ship's return. Well, still I was for taking him at that
proposal, and going myself ; but my partner, wiser than
myself, pursuaded me from it, representing the dangers, as
well of the seas as of the Japanese, who are a false,
cruel, and treacherous people ; likewise those of the
Spaniards at the Philippines, more false, cruel, and
treacherous than they. '

Were willing to go to Japan. While I was doing this, the
young man whom my nephew had left with me as my com-
panion came up,and told me that he thought that voyage
promised very fair, and that there was a great prospect of
advantage, and he would be very glad if I undertook it;
but that if I would not, and would give him' leave, he
would go as a merchant, or as I pleased to order him ;
that if he ever came to England, and I Was there and
alive, he would render me a faithful account of his success,
which should be as much mine as I pleased. I Was loath
to part with him ; but considering the prospect of advan-
tage, which really was considerable, and that he was a
young fellow likely to do well in it, I inclined to let him
go; but I told him I would consult my partner, and give
him an answer the next day. I discoursed about it with
my partner, who thereupon made a most generous offer.
“ You know it has been an unlucky ship,” said he, “ and
we both resolve not to go to sea in it again ; if your stew.
ard (so he called my man) will venture the voyage, I will
leave my share of the vessel to him, and let him make the
best of it ; and if we live to meet in England, and he
meets with success abroad, he shall account forone half

his own."
If my partner, who was _no way concerned with my
young man, made him such an offer, I could not do less
than offer him the same; and all the ship’s company being
willing to go with him, we made over half the ship to him
in property, and took a writing from him, obliging him to
account for the other, and away he went to Japan. The
japan merchant proved a very punctual, honest man to
him ; protected him at Japan, and got him a license to
come on shore, which the Europeans in general have not
lately obtained. He paid him his freight very punctually;
sent him to the Philippines, loaded with Japan and China

the Spaniards, brought back European goods again, and
a great quantity of spices ; and there he was not only paid
his freight very well, and at a very good price, but not be-
( ing willing to sell the ship, then the merchant furnished
him goods on his own account ; and with some money,
and some spices of his own which he brought with him,
he went back to the Manillas, where he sold his cargo very
well. Here,having made a good acquaintance at Manilla,
he got his ship made a free ship, and the Governor of
Manilla hired him to go to Acapulco, on the coast of
America, and gave him a license to land there, and to
travel to Mexico, and to pass in any Spanish ship to Eu-
rope with all his men. He made the voyage to Acapulco
very happily, and there he sold his ship; and having there
also obtained allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello,
he found means to get to Jamaica, with all his treasure,
and about eight years after came to England exceeding
rich.
But to return to our particular affairs: being now to part
' with the ship and ship's company, it came before us, of
course, to consider what recompense we should give to the
two men that gave us such timely notice of the design
against us in the river Cambodia. The truth was, they
had done us a very considerable service, and deserved well
at our hands; though, by the Way, they were a couple of
r0gues, too; for, as they believed the story of our being
pirates, and that we had really run away with the ship,
they came down to us, not only to betray the design that
was formed against us, but to go to sea with us as pirates.
One of them confessed afterward that nothing but the
hopes of going a-roughing brought him to do it; however,
the service they did us was not the less, and, therefore, as

mOney to be paid them which they said was mm to them
on board their respective ships; over and above that, I
gave each of them a small sum of money in gold, which
contented them very well. I then made the Englishman
gunner in the ship, the gunner being now made second
mate and purser; the Dutchman I made boatswain; so
they were both very well pleased, and proved very ser-
viceable, being both able seamen, and very stout fellows.
We were now on shore in China; if I thought myself
banished, and remote from my own country at Bengal,
where I had many ways to get home for my money, what
tould I think of myself now, when I was about athousand
leagues further off from home, and destitute of all manner
of prospect of return? All we had for it was this: that
in about four months’ time there was to be another fair at
the place where we were, and then we might be able to
purchase various manufactures of the country, and withal

sale, that would carry us and our goods whither we pleased.
This I liked very well, and resolved to wait; besides, as
our particular persons were not obnoxious, so if any Eng-
lish or Dutch ships came thither, perhaps we might have
an opportunity to load our goods, and get passage to
some other place in India nearer home. Upon these
hopes we resolved to continue here; but to divert our-
selves, we took two or three journeys into the country.
First, we went ten days journey to Nankin, a city well

them here. We wonder at the grandeur, the riches, the

the commerce, and conduct of these people; not that

erned as they, the Czar of Muscovy might with ease drive
them all out'of their country, and conquer them in one
campaign; and had the czar (who is now a growing prince)
fallen this way, instead of attacking the war-like Swedes,
and equally improved himself in the art of war, as they
say he has done; and if none of the powers of Europe
had envied or interrupted him, he might by this time have
been Emperor of China, instead of being beaten by the
King of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not one to
six in number.
As their strength and their grandeur, so their naviga~
tion, commerce, and husbandry are very imperfect, com-
pared to the same things in Europe ; also, in their knowl-
edge, their learning, and in their skill in the sciences, they
are either very awkward or defective, though they have
globes or spheres, and a smattering of the mathematics,
and think they know more than all the world besides.
But they know little of the motions of the heavenly bodies;
and 'so grossly and absurdly ignorant are their common
people, that when the sun is eclipsed, they think a great
dragon has assaulted it, and is going to runaway with it;
and they fall a-clattering with all the drums and kettles
in the 'country, to fright the monster away, just as we do
to hive a sWarm of bees.
As this is the only excursion of the kind which I have
made in all the accounts I have given of my travels, so I
shall make no more such. It is none of my business, nor
any part Of my design; but to give an account of my own
adventures through a life of inimitable wanderings and a
long variety of changes, which, perhaps, few that come
after me will have heard the like of; I shall, therefore, say
very little of all the mighty places, desert countries, and
numerous people I have yet to pass through, more than
relates to my own story, and which my concern among
them make necessary.
Iwas now, as near as I can compute, in the heart of
China, about thirty. degrees north of the line, for we were
returned from Nankin. I had indeed a mind to see the
city of Pekin, which I had heard so much of, and Father -
Simon importuned me daily to do it. At length his time
of going away being set, and the other missionary who

or principal magistrate in the province where they reside,
and who take great state upon them, traveling with great
attendance, and great homage from the people, who were
sometimes greatly impoverished by them, being obliged
to furnish provisions for them and all their attendants in
their journeys. I particularly observed in our traveling \

visions both for ourselves and our horses from the coun-
try, as belonging to the mandarin, yet we were 0bliged to
pay for everything we had, after the market price of the
country, and the mandarin’s steward collected it duly
from us. Thus our traveling in the retinue'of the manda-
rin, though it was a great act of kindness, was not Such a
mighty favor to us, but was a great advantage to him,
considering there were above thirty other people traveled
in the same manner besides us, under the protection of
his retinue; for the country furnished all the provisions
for nothing to him, and yet he took our money for them.

by nothing but their poverty, in some parts, which adds
to that which I call their misery; and I must needs think
the savages of America live much more happy than the
poorer sort of these, because as they have nothing, so they
desire nothing; whereas these are proud and insolent, and
in the main are in many parts mere beggars and drudges.
Their Ostentation is inexpressible; and, if they can, they
love to keep multitudes of servants or slaves, which is to
the last degree ridiculous, as well as their contempt of all
the world but themselves.
I must confess I traveled more pleasantly afterward in
the deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartary than
here, and yet the roads here are well paved and well kept,
and very convenient for travelers ; but nothing was more
awkward to me than to see such a haughty, imperious, in-
solent pe0ple, in the midst _of the grossest simplicity and
ignorance ; and my friend Father Simon and I used to be
very merry upon these occasions, to See their beggarly
pride. For example, coming by the house of a country

state he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being a
mixture of pomp and poverty. His habit was very proper

for a merry-andrew, being a dirty calico, with hanging
sleeves, tassels, and cuts and slashes almost on every side;
it covered a taffety vest, so greasy as to_testify that his
honor must be a most exquisite sloven. His horse was a
poor, starved, hobbling creature, and two slaves followed
him on foot to drive the poor creature along; he had a
whip in his hand, and he belabored the beast as fast about
the head as his slaves did about the tail; and thus he rode
by us, with about ten or twelve servants, going from the
city to his country seat, about half a league before us.

rode away before us; and as we stopped at a village about
an hour to refresh us, when we came by the country seat
of this great man, we saw him in a little place before his
door, eating a repast. It was a kind of garden, but he
was easy to be seen; and we were given to understand
that the more we looked at him the better he would be
pleased. He sat under a tree, something like the pal-
metto, which effectually shaded him over the head, and
on the south side ; but under the tree was placed a large
umbrella, which made that part look well enough. He
sat lolling back in a great elbow~chair, being a heavy, cor-
pulent man, and had his meat brought him by two women
slaves. He had two more, one of whom fed the squire
with a spoon, and the other held the dish with one hand,
and scraped off what he 'le; fall upon his worship’s beard
and taffety vest.
Leaving the poor wretch to please himself with our
'looking at him, as if we admired his idle pomp, we pur-
sued our journey. Father Simon had the curiosity/to stay
to inform himself what dainties the country justice had to
feed on in all his state, which he had the honor to taste
of, and which was, I think, a mess of boiled rice, with a

who we supposed were to eat of the same after their mas-
ter. As for our mandarin with whom we traveled, he was
respected as a king. surrounded always with his gentle-
man. and attended in all his appearances with such pomp
/

that I new little of him but at a distance. I observed that
there was not a horse in his retinue but that our carriers'
pack-horses in England seemed to me to look much bet-
ter; though it was hard to judge rightly, for they were so
covered with equipage, mantles, trappings, etc., that we
could scarce see anything but their feet and their heads
as they went along.
I was now light-hearted, and all my late trouble and
perplexity being over, I had no anxious thoughts about
me, which made this journey the pleasanter to me; in
which no ill accident attended me, only in passing or ford-
ing a small river, my horse fell and made me free of the
country, as they call it—that is to say, threw me in. The
place was not deep, but it wetted me all over. I mention
it because it spoiled my pocket-book, wherein I had set
down the names of seVeral people and places which I had
occasion to remember, and which, not taking due care of,
the leaves rotted, and the words were never after to be
read.
At length we arrived at Pekin. I had nobody with me
but the y0uth whom my nephew had given me to attend
me as a servant, and who proved very trusty and diligent;
and my partner had nobody with him but one servant, who
was a kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being de-
sirous to see the court, we bore his charges for his com-
pany, and for our use of him as an interpreter, for he un-
derstood the language of the country, and spoke good
French and a little English. Indeed, this old man was
most useful to us everywhere; for we had not been above
a week at Pekin, when he came laughing. “Ah, Senor
Inglese," says he, “I have something to tell will make
your heart glad." “My heart glad," says I ; “what can
that be ; I don’t know anything in this country can either
give me joy or grief to any great degree." “Yes, yes,”
said the old man, in broken English, “make you glad, me
sorry.” “ Why," said I, “ will it make you sorry P"
“ Because,” said he, “ you have brought me here twenty-

and which way shall I get to my port afterward, without
a ship, without a horse, without pecune ?—~so he called
money, being his broken Latin, of which he had abun-
dance to make us merry with. In short, he told us there
was a great caravan of Muscovite and Polish merchants

we would take the opportunity to go with them, and leave
him behind, to go back alone. I
I confess I was greatly deli .hted with this good news,
and had scarcepower to spea to him for some time, but
at last I said to him, “ How do you know this? are you
sure it is true P” “Yes,” saYs he; “I met this morning
in the street an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian,
who is among them. He came last from Astracan and
was designed to go to Tonquin, where I formerly new
hirrf, but has altered his mind, and is now resolved to go
with the caravan to Moscow, and so down the river Wolga
to Astracan.” “Well, senor,” says I. “ do not be uneasy
about being left to go back alone; if this be a. method for
my return to England, it shall be your fault if you go
back to Macao at all." We then went to consult together
what was to be done; and I asked my partner what he
thought of the pilot’s news, and whether it would suit
with his affairs? He told me he would do just as I
would; for he had settled all his affairs so well at Bengal,
and left his effects in such good hands, that as we had
made a good voyage, if he could invest it in China silks,
wrought and raw, he would be content to go to England,
alrlid then make a voyage back to Bengal by the Company's
s 1 s.
IPIaving resolved upon this, we agreed that if our Portu-
guese pilot would go with us, we would hear his charges
to Moscow, or to England, if he pleased; nor, indeed,
were we to be esteemed 0v ergenerOus in that either, if we
had not rewarded him further, the service he had done
, us being really worth more than that; for he had not only
been a pilot to us at sea, but he had been like a broker
for us on shore; and his procuring for us a japan mer-
chant was some hundreds of pounds in our pockets. So
being willing to gratify him, which was but doing him
justice, and very willing also to have him with us besides,
or he was a m0st necessary man on all occasions, we
agreed to give him a quantity of coined gold, which, as I

he goods. Having settled this between ourselves, we
called him to let him know what we resolved. I told him
he had complained of our being willing to let him go
back alone, and I was now about to tell him we designed
he should not go back at all. That as we had resolved to
go to Europe with the caravan, we were very willing he
should go with us; and that we called him to know his
mind. He shook his head and said it was a long journey,

sist himself when he came there. We told him we be—
lieved it was so, and therefore we had resolved to do
something for him that should let him see how sensible
we were of the service he had done us, and also how
agreeable he was to us; and then I told him what we had
resolved to give him here, which he might lay out as we
woiild do our own; and that as for his charges, if he
would go with us we would set him safe on shore (life
and casualties excepted), either in Muscovy or England,
as he would choose, at our own charge,except only the
carriage of his goods. He received the proposal like a
man transported, and told us he would go with us over
all the whole world; and so we all prepared for our
journey. However, as it was with us, so it was with the
other merchants; they had many things to do, and instead

camels for our share, besides those we rode upon ; these,
with two or three spare horses, and two horses loaded with
provisions, made together twenty-six camels and horses in
our retinue.
The company was very great, and, as near as I can re-
member, made between three and four hundred horses,
and upward of one hundred and twenty men, very well
armed and provided for all events; for as the eastern
caravans are subject to be attacked by the Arabs, so are
these by the Tartars. The company consisted of peo-

The road all on this side of the country is very popu-
lous, and is full of potters and earth-makers—that is to
say, people that temper the earth for the China ware. As
I was coming along, our Portuguese pilot, who had always
something or other to say to make us merry, told me he
would show me the greatest rarity in all the country, and
that I should have this to say of China, after all the ill-
humored things that I had said of it, that I had seen one
thing which was not to be seen in all the world beside. I
was very importunate to know what it was ; at last he told
me it was a gentleman’s house built with China ware.
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 467

"Well," says, I, “are not the materials of their buildings
the products of their own country, and so it is all China
ware, is it not?” “ No, no," says he, “ I mean it is a
house all made of China ware, such as you call it in Eng-
land, or as it is called in our country, porcelain." “ Well,"
says I, “ such a thing may be. How big is it? Can we
carry it in a box upon a camel? If we can we will buy it.”
“Upon a camel l " says the old pilot, holding up both“
his hands ; “ why, there is a family of thirty people lives
in it." ' .
I was then curious, indeed, to see it; and when I came
to it, it was nothing but this: it was a timber house, or a
house built, as we call it in England, with lath and plaster,
but all this plastering was really China ware—that is to
say, it was plastered with the earth that makes China ware.
The outside, which the sun shone hot upon was glazed,
and looked very well, perfectly white, and painted with
_...,~_,, _‘y

the walls, instead of wainscot, were lined with hardened
and painted tiles, like the little square tiles we call galley-

several parts of England ; as hard as stone, and smooth,
but not burned and painted, except some smaller rooms,
like closets, which were all, as it were, paved with the
same tiles ; the ceiling and all the plastering work in the
whole house were of the same earth ; and, after all, the
roof was covered with tiles of the same, but of a deep shin-
ing black. This was a China ware house indeed, truly and
literally to be called so, and had I not been upon the
journey, I could have stayed some days to see and ex-
amine the particulars of it. They told me there were

As this is one of the singularities of China, so they may

be allowed to excel in it; but I am very sure they end
in their accounts of it; for they told me such incredible
things of their performance in crockery ware, for such it
is, that I care not to relate, as knowing it could not be true.

the wall bounds, without measuring the windings and turn-

I stood still an hour or thereabouts without trespassing
on our orders (for so long the caravan was in passing the
gate), to look at it on every side, near and far off 3 I mean
what was within my view ; and the guide, who had been
extolling it for the wonder of the world, was mighty eager
to hear my opinion of it. I told him it was a m05t excel-
lent thing to keep out the Tartars ; which he happened
not to understand as I meant it, and so took it for a compli-
ment ; but the old ilot laughed : “ Oh, Senor Inglese,”
says he, “ you spea in colors.” “ In colors 1 ” said I,
“ what do you mean by that i’” “ Why, you speak what
looks white this way and black that way—gay one way and
dull another. You tell him it is a good wall to keep out
Tartars ; you tell me by that it is good for nothing but to
keep out Ta'rtars. I understand you, Senor Inglese, I uns
derstand you ; but Senor Chinese understood you his own
way.” “Well,” says I, “ do you think it would stand out
an army of our country people, with a good train of
artillery; or our engineers, with two companies of miners ?
Would net they batter it down in ten days, that an
army might enter in battalia; or blow it up in the air,
foundation and all, that there should be no sign of it
left ? ”_ “Ay, ay,” says he, “ I know that.” The Chinese
wanted mightily to know what I said to the pilot, and
I gave him leave to tell him a few days after, for we
were then almost out of their country, and he was to
leave us a little time after this ; but when he knew What I
said, he was dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard no

keeping together in a caravan as We traveled, for we saw'
several troops of Tartars roving about ; but when I came
to see them distinctly, I wondered more that the Chinese
Empire could be conquered by such contemptible felIOWs;

In pursuit of this odd ~ort of game it was our hap to
meet with about forty Tartars ; whether they were hunt-

kind of prey, we know not ; but as soon as they saw us,
one of them blew a hideous blast on a kind of horn. This

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to be
among us ; and as soon as he heard the horn he told us
that we had nothing to do but to charge them without loss
of time ; and drawing us up in a line, he asked if we were

he rode directly toward them. They stood gazing at us

held us three days' and nights’ march ;and we were
obliged to carry our water with us in great leathern bot-
tles, and to encamp all night, just as I have heard they
do in the desert of Arabia. I asked our guides whose do-
minion this was in, and they told me this was a kind of
border that might be called no man’s land, being a part
of Great Karakathy, or Grand Tartary; that, however,
it was all reckoned as belonging to China, but that
there was no care taken here to preserve it from the in-
roads of thieves, and therefore it was reckoned the worst
desert in the whole march, though we were to go over some
much larger.
In passing this frightful wilderness we saw, two or three
times, little parties of the Tartars, but they seemed to
be upon their own affairs, and to have no design up-
on us; and so, like the man who met the devil, if they
had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to say to
them; we let them go. Once, however, a party of
them came so near as to stand and gaze at us.
Whether it was to consider if they should attack us
or not, we knew not; but when we had passed at'
some distance by them, we made a rear-guard of forty
men, and stood ready for them, letting the caravan
pass half a mile or thereabouts before us. After awhile

of these towns (about two days and a half's journey

a camel, of which there are plenty to be sold all the
way upon that road, and horses also, such as they are.

In this interval the poor Chinese came in who had

By this time I was a little recovered. I thought, when

but, as I said above, I wondered where I was, how I came
upon the ground, and what was the matter. A few mo-

know where; so I clapped my hand to my head, and took
it away bloody ; then I felt my head ache; and in a mo-
ment memory returned, and everything was present to me
again. I jumped upon my feet instantly, and got hold of
my sword, but no enemies were in view; I found a Tartar
lying dead, and his horse standing very quietly by him ,
and, looking further, I saw my deliverer, who had been to
see what the Chinese had done, coming back with his
hanger in his hand. The old'man, seeing me on my feet,
came running to me, and joyfully embraced me, being
afraid before that I had been killed. Seeing me bloody,
he would see how I was hurt ; but it was not much, only

We made no great gain, however, by this victory, for we
lost a camel and gained a horse. I paid for the lost camel,
and sent for another; but I did not go to fetch it myself;

ney of this city when messengers were sent express to
every part of the road to tell all travelers and caravans to
halt till they had a guard sent for them ; for that an un-
usual body of Tartars, making ten thousand in all,
had appeared in the way, about thirty miles beyond the

'}l"his was very bad news to travelers; however, it was
carefully done of the governor, and we were very glad
to hear we should have a guard. Accordingly two days
after, we had two hundred soldiers sent us from a gar-
rison of the Chinese on our left, and three hundred
more from the city of Naum, and with these we ad-
vanced boldly. The three hundred soldiers from Naum
marched in our front, the two hundred in our rear, and our
men on each side of our camels, with our baggage and
the whole caravan in the center; in this order, and well
prepared for battle, we thought ourselves a match for the
whole ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared;
but the next day, when they did appear, it was quite an-
other thing. .

EARLY in the morning, when marching from a little
town called Changu, we had a river to pass,which we were
obliged to ferry ; and, had the Tartars had any intelli-
gence, then had been the time to have attacked us, when,
the caravan being over, the rear-guard was behind ; but
they did not appear there. About three hours after, when

miles over, we knew, by a cloud of dust they raised, that
the enemy was at hand, and presently they came on upon
the spur.
Our Chinese guards in the front, who had talked so big
the day before, began to stagger; and the soldiers fre-
quently looked behind them, a certain sign in a soldier that
he is just ready to run away. My old pilot was of my
'mind; and being near me, called out, “Senor Inglese,


these fellows must be encouraged, or they will ruin us all;
for if the Tartars come on they will never stand it." “I
am of your mind,” said I ; “ but what must be done?”

this they will every man turn his back.” Immediately I
rode up to our leader and told him, who was exactly of our

and so we marched, leaving the last two hundred men to
make a body of themselves, and to guard the camels; only
that, if need were, they should send a hundred men to as-

front of our line; and, as we found them within gunshot,
our leader ordered the two wings to advance swiftly, and
give them a salvo on each wing with their shot, which was
done. They then went off, I suppose, to give an account
of the reception they were like to meet with ; indeed, that
salute cloyed their stomachs, for they immediately halted,
stood awhile to consider of it, and wheeling off to the left,
they gave over their design for that time, which was very
agreeable to our circumstances.
Two days after we came to the city of Naun, or Naum;
we thanked the governor for his care of us, and collected
to the value of a hundred crowns, or thereabouts, which
we gave to the soldiers sent to guard us ; and here we
rested one day. This is a garrison indeed, and there were
nine hundred soldiers kept here; but the reason of it was,
that formerly the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them
than they now do. the Muscovites having abandoned that
part of the country, which lies from this city west fo't'

above two thousand miles from Muscovy properly so called.

I could not but feel great satisfaction that I was arrived in

Christians, yet such they pretend to be, and are very de-

ing man who travels the world as I have done, what a
blessing it is to be brought into the world where the name
of God and a Redeemer is known, adored, and worshiped;
and not where the people, given up to strong delusions,
worship the devil, and prostrate themselves to monsters,
elements, horrid-shaped animals, and monstrous images.
Not a town or city we passed through but had their pago-
das, their idols, and their temples, and ignorant people
worshiping even the works of their own hands. Now we
came where, at least, a face of the Christian worship ap-
eared; where the knee was bowed to Jesus ; and whether
ignorantly or not, yet the Christian religion was owned,
and the name of the true God was called upon and adored;
and it made my soul rejoice to see it. I saluted the brave

taking him by the hand, I said to him, “ Blessed be God,1
we are once again among Christians.” He smiled, and
answered, “ Do not rejoice too soon, countryman ; these
Muscovites are but an odd Sort of Christians ; and but for
the name of it you may see very little of the substance for
some months further of our journey." “ Well," says I,
“but still it is better than paganism, and worshiping of
devils.” “ Why, I will tell you,” says he, “except the
Russian soldiers in the garrisons, and a few of the inhabi-
tants of the cities upon the road, all the rest of this country,
far above a thousand miles further, is inhabited by the worst
and most ignorant of pagans.” And so, indeed, we found it.
We now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth
that is to be found in any part of the world ; we had, at
least, twelve thousand miles to the sea eastward; two thou-
sand to the bottom of the Baltic Sea westward; and above
three thousand, if we left that sea, and went on west, to

eight hundred to the Frozen Sea north.

ate journeys, and were Very visibly oblige to the care
the czar has taken to have cities and towns built in as
many place as it is possible to place them, where his

were placed in Britain, for the security of commerce,
and for the lodging of travelers. Thus it was here;

as twenty days to travel over. In a village near the last

at the door of a hut, made of sheep and cow-skins dried,

I confess I was more moved at their stupidity and bru-
tish worship of a hobgoblin than ever I was at mything
in my life, and, overcome with rage, I rode up to the hide~
ous idol, and with my sword made a stroke at the bonnet
that was on its head, and cut it in two ; and one of our
men that was with me, taking hold of the sheep-skin that
covered it, pulled at it, when, behold ! a most hideous out-
cry ran through the village, and two or three hundred peo-
le came about my cars, so that I was glad to scour for
it, for some had bows and arrows ; but I resolved from
that moment to visit them again. Our caravan rested three
nights at the town, which was about four miles off, in
order to provide some horses which they wanted, several
of the horses having been lamed and jaded with the long
march over the last desert ; so we had some leisure here
to put my design in execution. I communicated it to the

and added that, from his knowledge of the country and
its customs, he feared we should fall into great peril by
giving offense to these brutal idol worshipers. This some-
what stayed my purpose, but I was still uneasy all that
day to put my project in execution ; and that evening,
meeting the Scots merchant in our walk about the town,
I again called upon him to aid me in it. When he' found
me resolute he said that, on further thought, he could not

us; “and one,” said he, “as famous for his zeal as
you can desire any one to be against such devilish
things as these.” So we agreed to goal, only we three
and my man-servant, and resolved to put it in execu
tion the following night about midnight, with all poss-»
ble secrecy.
We thought it better to delay it till the next night, be-
cause the caravan being to set forward in the morning, we
supposed the governor could not pretend to give them
any satisfaction upon us when we were out of his power.
The Scots merchant, as steady in his resolution for
the enterprise as bold in executing, brought me a Tar-
tar’s robe or gown of sheep-skins, and a bonnet, with ‘
a bow and arrows, and had provided the same for him-
self and his countryman, that the people, if they saw

night we spent in mixing up some combustible matter,
with aqua m'lw, gunpowder, and such other materials as
we could get; and having a good quantity of tar in a
little pot, about an hour after night we set out upon our
expedition.
We came to the place about eleven o’clock at night, and
found that the people had not the least suspicion of danger
attending their idol. The night was cloudy; yet the moon
gave us light enough to see that the idol stood just in
the same posture and place that it did before. The
people seemed to be all at their rest; only that in the
great hut, where we saw the three priests, we saw at
light, and going up close to the door, we heard people

“Well, then," said the Scots merchant,“ I will tell you
what we will do: we will try to make them prisoners,
tie their hands, and make them stand and see their idol
destroyed.”
As it happened, we had twine or pack-thread enough-

did we knocked at the door, when one of the priests
coming to it, we immediately seized upon him, and led
him to the idol, where we gagged him that he might not
make a noise, tied his feet also together, and left him on
the ground.
Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that ans
other would come out to see what the matter was; but
we waited so long till the third man came back to us; and
then nobody coming out, we knocked again gently, and
immediately out came two more, and we served them just
in the same manner, but were obliged to go all with them,
and lay them down by the idol some distance from one
another ; when, going back, we found two more were come
out of the door, and a third stood behind them within
the door. We seized the two, and immediately tied
them, when the third, stepping back and crying out,

We quickly took them from the hut, where the smoke
soon drove us out, bound them as we had done thev
others, and all without any noise. Then we carried them

work with him. First, we daubed him all over. and his

man remembered that by the hut, where the men were,
there lay a heap of dry forage; and away he and
the other Sootsman ran and fetched their arms full
of that. When we had done this, we took all our
prisoners, and brought them, having untied their feet and

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour or thereabouts,
till the powder in the eyes, and mouth, ears of the
idol blew up, and as we could perceive, had split
altogether; and in a word, till we saw it burned so
that it would soon be quite consumed. We then be-
gan to think of going away; but the Scotsman said,

selves with the idol." So we resolved to stay till the
forage was burned down too, and then came away
and left them. After the feat was performed, we ap-
peared in the morning among our fellow-travelers, ex-
ceedingly busy in getting ready for our journey; nor
could any man suppose that we had been anywhere but
in our beds.
But the affair did not end so; the next day came a great
number of the country people to the town gates, and in a
most outrageous manner demanded satisfaction of the
Russian governor for the insulting their priests and burn~
ing their great Cham Chi-Thaungu. The people of Nort-

said the Tartars were already no less than thirty
thousand strong. The Russian governor sent out mes-
sengers to appease them, assuring them that he knew
nothing of it, and that there had not a soul in his
garrison been abroad, so that it could not be from anybody
there : _but if they could let him know who did it, they
should be exemplarily punished. They returned haughti-
1y that all the country reverenced the great Chain Chi-
Thaungu, who dwelt in the sun, and no mortal would have
dared to offer violence to 'his image but some Christian
miscreant ; and they therefore resolved to denounce war
against him and all the Russians, who, they said, were
miscreants and Christians.
The governor, unwilling to make a breach, or to have
any cause of war alleged to be given by him, the czar hav-
ing strictly charged him to treat the conquered country
with gentleness, gave them all the good words he could.
At last he told them there was a caravan gone toward
Russia that morning, and perhaps it was some of them
who had done them this injury ; and that they would be

into it. This seemed to appease them alittle; and accord-
ingly the governor sent after us, and gave us a particular
account how the thing was ; intimating withal, that if any
in our caravan had done it they should make their escape;
but whether we had done it or no, we should make
all the haste forward that was possible : and that, in
the meantime, he would keep them in play as long as he
could.
This was very friendly in the governor : however, when
it came to the caravan, there was nobody knew anything
of the matter; and as for us that were guilty, we were
least of all suspected. However, the captain of the cara-
van for the time took the hint that the governor gave us,
and we traveled two days and two nights without any con-
siderable stop, and then we lay ata village called Plothus'
nor did we make any long stop here, but hastened 0;

expected we should be safe. But upon the second day s

body of horses appear on the other side of the lake, to-

away west, as we did, but had supposed we would have
that side of the lake, whereas, we very happily took the south
side; and in two days more they disappeared again : for
they, believing we were still before them, pushed on till we
came to the Udda, a very great river when it passes fur-
ther north, but when we came to it we found it narrow and
fordable.
The third day they had either found their mistake,
or had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us
toward dusk. We had, to our great satisfaction, just

over, where we had no towns to lodge, and, indeed, ex-
pected none but the city Jarawena, which we had yet two
days’ march to; the desert, however, had some few woods
in it on this side, and little rivers, which ran all into the
great river Udda; it was in a narrow strait, between little
but very thick woods, that we pitched our camp that
night, expecting to be attacked before morning. As it
was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go about in troops
in that desert, so the caravans always fortify themselves
every night against them, as against armies of robbers ;
and it was, therefore, no new thing to be pursued, But
we had this night a most advantageous camp: for as
we lay between two woods, with a little rivulet run-
ning just before our front, we could not be surround-
ed, or attacked any way but in our front or rear.
We took care also to make our front as strong as we could,
by placing our packs, with the camels and horses, all in a
line, on the inside of the river, and felling some trees in
our rear. _
In this posture we encamped for the night; but the

they would go away, and do us no further harm, other-
wise they would destroy us all. Our men looked very
blank at this message, and began tostare at one another to
see who looked with the most guilt in their faces;
but nobody was the word—nobody did it. The leader
of the caravan sent word he was well assured that
it was not done by any of our camp ; that we were

we had done no harm to them or to any one else .'

at least to the right and rather behind us. So he takes
his bow and arrows, and getting on horseback, he rides
away from our rear directly, as it were back to Nortziousky,
after this he takes a great circuit about, and comes di“
rectly on the arm of the Tartars as if he had been sent
expressly to tell t em a lon story that the people who
had burned the Cham Chi-T aungu were gone to Sibeil-
ka, with a caravan of miscreants, as he called them—that
is to say, Christians ; and that they had resolved to burn
the god Scal-Isar, belonging to the Tonguses. As this
fellow was himself a Tartar,'and perfectly spoke their
language, he counterfeited so well that they all believed
him, and away they drove in a violent hurry to Sibeilka. In
less than three hours they were entirely out of our sight,
and we never heard any more of them, nor whether they
went to Sibeilka or no. So we passed away safely on to
Jarawena, where there was a Russian garrison, and there
484 ROBINSON causes. '
From this city We had a frightful desert, which held us
twenty-three days’ march. We furnished ourselves with
some tents here, for the better accommodating ourselves
in the night ; and the leader of the caravan procured six-
teen wagons of the country, for carrying our water or pro-
visioheosnd these carriages were our defense every night
round r little camp ; so that had the Tartars appeared,
unless they had been very numerous indeed, they would
not have been able to hurt us. We may well be
supposed t0\have wanted rest again after this long
journey ; for hi this desert we neither saw house not
tree, and scarce a bush ; though we saw abundance
of the sable-hunters, who are all Tartars of Mogul
Tartary, of which this country is a part; and they fre-
quently attack small caravans, but we saw‘ no numbers of
them together.
After we had passed this desert we came into acountry
pretty well inhabited-that is to say, we found towns and
castles, settled by the czar with garrisons of stationary
soldiers, to protect the caravans and defend the country
against the Tartars, who would otherwise make very
dangerous traveling; and his czarish majesty has given
such strict orders for the well guarding the caravans,that,
if there are any Tartars heard of in the country, detach~
ments of the garrison are always sent ‘to see the traveler
safe from station to station. Thus the governor of Adin-

the people more civilized; but I found myself mistaken
in both; for we had yet the nation of the Tonguses to pass
through, where we saw the same tokens of paganism and
barbarity as before ; only, as they were conquered by the
Muscovites, they were not so dangerous, but for rudeness
of manners and idolatry no people in the world ever went
beyond them. They are all clothed in skins of beasts, and
that houses are built of the same ; you know not a man
from a woman, neither by the ruggedness of their counte~
nances nor their clothes ; and in the winter, when the
ground is covered with snow, they live underground in
vaults, which have cavities going from one to another. If
the Tartars had their Cham Chi-Thaungu for a whole
village or country, these had idols in every hut and every
cave; This country, I reckon, was, from the desert I spoke
of last, at least four hundred miles, half of it being another


desert, which took us up twelve days’ severe traveling,
without house or tree ; and we were obliged again to
carry our own provisions, as well water and bread. After
we were out of this desert, and had traveled two days,
we came to Janezay, a Muscovite city, or station, on the
great river Janezay, which, they told us there, parted
Europe from Asia. '
All the country between the river Oby and the river
Janezay is as entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous,
as the remotest of the Tartars. I also found, which I ob-
served to the Muscovite governors whom I had an oppor-
tunity to converse with, that the poor pagans are not
much wiser, or nearer Christianity, for being under the
Muscovite government, which they. acknowledged was
true enough—but that, as they said, was none of their
business ; that if the czar expected to convert his
Siberian, Tonguse, or Tartar subjects, it should be done
by sending clergymen among them, not soldiers ; and
they added, with more sincerity than I expected,
that it was not so much the concern of their mon-
arch to make the people Christians as to make them
subjects.
From this river to the Oby we crossed a wild, unculti-
vated country, barren of people and good management,
otherwise it is in itself a pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable
country. What inhabitants we found in it are all pagans,
except such as are sent among them from Russia; for this
is the country-_I mean on both sides the river Oby——
whither the Muscovite criminals that are put to death are
banished, and from whence it is next to impossible they
should ever get away. I have nothing material to say of
my particular affairs till I came to Tobolski, the capital
city of Siberia, where I continued some time on the follow-
ing account:
We had now been almost seven months on our journey,
and winter began to come on apace ; whereupon my part.
ner and I called a. council about our particular affairs, in
which we found it proper, as we were bound for England,
to consider how to dispose of ourselves. They told us of

ing frozen, is one universal covering to nature, by which
the hills,‘vales, rivers, and lakes are all smooth and hard
as a stonemnd they run upon the surface, without any
regard to what is underneath.
But I had no occasion to urge a winter journey of
this kind. I was bound to England, not to Moscow,
and my route lay two ways: either I must go on as '
the caravan went, till I came to Jarislaw, and then go
off west for Narva and the Gulf of Finland, and so on
to Dantzic, where I might possibly sell my China car-
go to good advantage; or I must leave the caravan
at a little town on the Dwina, from whence I had but
six days by water to Archangel, and from thence might
be sure of shipping either to England, Holland, 0r Ham-
bur .
Ngow, to go any of these journeys in the winter would
have been preposterous, for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would
have been frozen up and I could not get passage; and
to go by land in those countries was far less safe than
among the Mogul Tartars ; likewise, as to Archangel in
October, all the ships would be gone from thence,
and even the merchants who dwell there in summer
retire south to Moscow in the winter, when the ships
are gone; so that I could have nothing but extremity
of cold to encounter, with a scarcity of provisions, and
must lie in an empty town all the winter. Therefore,
upon the whole, I thought it much my better way to let
the caravan go, and make provisions to winter where I was,
at Tobolski, in Siberia, in the latitude of about sixty de-
grees, where I was sure of three things to wear out a cold
winter with—viz., plenty of provisions, such as the country
afforded, a warm house, with fuel enough, and excellent
company. '
I was now in quite a different climate from my beloved
island, where I never felt cold, except when I had my
ague ; on the contrary, I had much to do to bear any

Now I had three good vests, with large robes or gowns

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be
possible to meet with good company here, in a country so
barbarous as this—one of the most northernly parts of
Europe. But this being the country where the state crimi-
nals of Muscovy, as I observed before, are all banished,
this city was full of Russian noblemen, gentlemen, soldiers,
and courtiers. Here was the famous Prince Galitzin, the
‘ old German Robostiski, and several other persons of note,
and some ladies. By means of my Scotch merchant,
whom, nevertheless, I parted with here, I made an ac~
quaintance with several of these gentlemen ; and from
these, in the long winter nights in which I stayed here, I
received several very agreeable visits.

with the story, and especially the prince, who told me,
with a sigh, that the true greatness of life was to be mas-

a state of life as mine to be Czar of Muscovy ; and that he
- found more felicity in the retirement he seemed to ban~

he enjoyed in the court of his master the czar ; that the
height of human wisdom was to bring our tempers down

the weight of the greatest storms without. When he

done before him ; but a little time and consideration had
made him look into himself, as well as round him to things
without: that he found the mind of man, if it was but

and how little this world was concerned in its true felicity,
was perfectly capable of making a felicity for itself fully
satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own best ends and
desires, with but little assistance from the world. That
being now deprived of all the fancied felicity which be en-
joyed in the full exercise of worldly pleasures, he said he
was at leisure to look ut the dark side of them, where he
found all manner of deformity; and was now convinced
that virtue only makes a man truly wise, rich, and great,
and preserves him in the way to a superior happiness in
a future state ; and in this, he said, they were more happy
in their banishment than all their enemies were, who had
full possession of all the wealth and power they had left
behind them. “Now, sir,” says he, “ do I bring my mind
to this politically, from the necessity of my circumstances,
which some call miserable; but,if I know anything of my-
self, I would not now go back, though the czar my mas-
ter should call me, and reinstate me in all my former
grandeur."
He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, so
much earnestness and motion of his spirits, that it was evi_
dent is was the true sense of his soul ; there was no room
to doubt his sincerity. I told him I once thought myself
a kind of monarch in my old station, of which I had given


him an account; but that I thought he was not only a
monarch, but a great conqueror ; for that he had got a
victory over his Own exhorbitant desires, and the abso-
lute dominion over himself, he whose reason entirely
governs his will, is certainly greater than he that conquers

I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful
winter I thought it ; the cold so intense that I could not

It was now March, the days grown considerably longer,

covy or the Baltic, I made no motion ; knowing very well
that the ships from the south‘do not set out for that part
of the world till May or June, and that if I was there by
the beginning of August, it would be as soon as any ships
would be ready to sail. Therefore I made no haste to be
gone, as others did: in a word, I saw a great many people,
nay, all the travelers, go away before me. It seems every
year they go from thence to Muscovy for trade, to carry
furs, and ' buy necessaries, which they bring back with
them to furnish their shops: also others went on the same
errand to Archangel.
In the month of May I began to. make all ready to pack
up ; and, as I was doing this, it occurred to me that, see-
iug all these people were banished by the czar to Siberia,
and yet, when they came there, were left at liberty to go
whither they would, why they did not then go away to

such an attempt. But my wonder was over when I entered
upon that subject with the person I have mentioned

he, “ the place where we are; and, secondly, the con-
dition we are in; especially the generality of the people
who are banished thither. We are surrounded With
stronger thingswthan bars or bolts ; on the north side, an
unnavigable oc‘ean, where ship never sailed and boat never
swam ; every other way we have above a thousand miles
to pass through the czar’s own dominions, and by ways
utterly impassable, except by the roads made by the gov-
ernment, and through the towns garrisoned by his troops;
in short, we could neither pass undiscovered by the road,
nor subsist any other way, so that it is in vain to attempt it."
I was silenced at once, and found that they were in a
prison every jot as secure as if they had been locked up
in the castle at Moscow : however, it came into my
thoughts that I might certainly be made an instrument to
procure the escape of this excellent person ; and that,
whatever hazard I ran, I would certainly try if I could
carry him off. Upon this, I took an occasion one evening
to tell him my thoughts. I represented to him that it was
very clear for me to carry him away. there being no guard
over him in the country; and as I was not going to Mos-
cow, but to Archangel, and that I went in the retinue of
a caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in the station-
ary-towns in the desert, but could encamp every night
where I would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to
Archangel, where I would immediately secure nin': on
board an English ship, and carry him safe along with me;
and as to his subsistence and other particulars, it should
be my care till he could better supply himself,
He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on
me all the while I spoke; nay, I could see in his very face
that what I said put his spirits into an exceeding ferment;
his color frequently changed, his eyes looked red, and his

countenance; nor could he immediately answer me when I
had done, and, as it were, hesitated what he would say to
it : but after he had paused a little, he embraced me, and
said, “How unhappy are we, unguardedr creatures as we
are, that even our greatest acts of friendship are made
snares unto us, and we are made tempters of one another!"
He then heartily thanked me for my offers of service, but
withstood resolutely the arguments I used to urge him to
set himself free. He declared, in earnest terms, that he
was fully bent on remaining where he was rather than seek
to return to his former miserable greatness, as he called it:
Where the seeds of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and,
stood silent, looking at him, and, indeed, admiring what I
saw. The struggle in his soul was so great, that, though
the weather was extremely cold, it put him into a most
violent heat ; so I said a word or two, that I would leave
him to consider of it, and wait on him again, and then I
withdrew to my own apartment.
About two hours after I heard somebody at ‘or near the
door of my room, and I was going to open the door, but
he had opened it and come in. “ My dear friend," says
he, “you_had almost overset me, but I am recovered. D0

from a man in his circumstances,and I would have avoided
them, but he would not be refused. The next morning I
sent my servant to his lordship with a small present of tea,
and two pieces of China damask, and four little wedges of
Japan gold, which did not all weigh above six ounces or
thereabouts, but were far short of the value of his sables,
which, when I came to England, I found worth near two
hundred pounds. He accepted the tea, and one piece of
the damask, and one of the pieces of gold, which had a

he took for the rarity of it, but would not take any more;
and he sent word by my servant that he desired to speak
with me.
When I came to him he told me I knew what had
passed between us, and hoped I would not move him any
more in that affair; but that, since I had made such a
generous offer to him, he asked me if Iv had kindness
enough to offer the same to another person that he
would name to me, in whom he had a great share of
concern. In a word, he told me it was his only son; who,
though I had not seen him, was in the same condition with
himself, and above two hundred miles from him, on the
other side of the Oby; but that, if I consented, he would
send for him.
I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. I
made some ceremony in letting him understand that it was


wholly on his account ; and that, seeing I could not pre-
Vail on him, I would show my respect to him by my
concern for his son. ‘He sent the next day for his son;
and in about twenty days he came back with the
messenger, bringing six or seven horses, loaded with
very rich furs, which, on the whole, amounted to a

to the town, but left the young lord at a distance till
night, when he came incognito into our apartment, and
his father presented him to me; and, in short, we concerted
the manner of our traveling, and everything proper for
the journey. ,

here.
It was the beginning of June when I left this remote
place. We were now reduced to a very small caravan,
having only thirty-two horses and camels in all, which
passed for mine, though my new guest was proprietor of
eleven of them. It was natural also that I should take
more servants with me than I had before ; and the young
lord passed for my steward ; what great man I passed for
myself I know not, neither did it concern me to inquire.
We had here the worst and the largest desert to pass over
that we met with in our whole journey; I call it the worst,
because the way was very deep in some places, and very
uneven in others ; the best we had to say for it was, that
we thought We had no troops of Tartars, or robbers to
fear, as they never came on this side of the river Oby, or
at least very seldom; but we found it otherwise.
My young lord had a faithful Siberian servant, who was
perfectly acquainted with the country, and led us by priv-
ate roads, so that we avoided Coming into the principal
towns and cities upon the great road, such as Tumen,
Soloy Kamaskoy, and several others; because the Musco-
vite garrisons which are kept there are very curious and
strict in their observance upon travelers, and searching
lest any of the banished persons of note should make their
escape that way into Muscovy ; but, by this means, as we
were kept out of the cities, so our whole journey was a
desert, and we were obliged to encamp and lie in our
tents, when we might have had very good accommodation
in the cities on the way; this the young 10rd was so sensi-
ble of, that he would not allow us to lie abroad when we
came to several cities on the way, but lay abroad himself,
with his servant, in the woods, and met us always at the
appointed places.
We had just entered Europe, having passed the river
Kama, which in these parts is the boundary between

was called Soloy Kamaskoy, that is, the great city on the
river Kama. And here we thought to see some evident
alteration in the people; but we were mistaken ; for as we
had a vast desert to pass, which is near'seven hundred
miles long in some places, butv not above two hundred
miles over where we passed it, so, till we came past that
horrible place, we found very little difference between
that country and Mogul Tartary. The people are mostly
pagans; their houses and towns full of idols; and their way
of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities and vil-
lages near them, where they are Christians, as they call
themselves, of the Greek Church : but have their religion
mingled with so many relics of superstition, that it is
scarce to be known in some places from mere sorcery and
witchcraft.
In passing this forest (after all our dangers were, to our
imagination, escaped), I thought, indeed, we must have
been plundered and robbed, and perhaps murdered, by a
troop of thieves: of what country they were I am yet at a
loss to know; but they were all on horseback, carried bows
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 495
They came so near to us as to be within two musket shot,
and, asking no questions, surrounded us with their horses,
and looked very earnestly upon us twice ; at length, they
placed themselves just in our way ; upon which we drew
up in a little line, before our camels, being not above‘six-
teen men in all. Thus drawn up, we halted, and sent out
the Siberian servant, who attended his 10rd, to see who

they were ; his master was the more willing to let him go,
because he was not a little apprehensive that they were a
Siberian troop sent out after him. The man came up near

he spoke several of their languages, or dialects of lan-
guages rather, he could not understand a word they said;
however, after some signs to him not to come near them
at his peril, the fellow came back no wiser than he went;
only that by their dress, he said, he believed them to be
some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Circassian hordes,
and that there must be more of them upon the great des-
ert, though he never heard that any of them were seen so
far north before.
This was small comfort to us ; however, we had no
remedy: there was on our left hand, at about a quarter of
a mile distance, a little grove, and very near the road. I
immediately resolved we should advance to those trees,

considered that the trees wouldjin a great measure cover
us from their arrows; and, in the next place, they could not
Come to charge us in a body : it was, indeed, my old Por-
tuguese pilot who proposed it, and who had this excellency
attending him, that he was always readiest and most apt
to direct and encourage us in cases of the most danger.
We advanced immediately, with what speed we could, and
gained that little wood ; the Tartars, or thieves, for we
knew not what to call them, keeping their stand, and not
attempting to hinder us. When we came thither, we
found, to our great satisfaction, that it was a swampy
piece of ground, and on the one side a very great spring
of water, which, running out in a little brook, was a
little further joined by another of the like size ; and
was, in short, the source of a considerable river, called
afterward the Wirtska; the trees which grew about this
spring were not above two hundred, but very large, and
stood pretty thick, so that as soon as we got in, we saw
ourselves perfectly safe from the enemy unless they at-
tacked us on foot.
While we stayed here waiting the motion of the enemy
some hours, without perceiving that they made any move-
ment, our Portuguese, with some help, out several arms
of trees half off, and laid them hanging across from one
tree to another, and in a manner fenced us in. About two

hours before night they came down directly upon us;
and though we had not perceived it, we found they had
been joined by some more, so that they were near four-

what they wanted, and bade them keep off ; but they

About an hour after they again made a motion to attack
us, and rode round our little wood to see where they might

they went off again; and we resolved not to stir for that
night.
We slept little, but spent the most part of the night
in strengthening our situation, and barricading the en-
trances into the wood, and keeping a strict watch. We
waited for daylight, and when it came, it gave us a
very unwelcome discovery indeed; for the enemy, who
we thought were discouraged with the reception they
met with, were now greatly increased, and had set up
eleven or twelve huts or tents, as if they were resolved to
besiege us ; and this little camp they had pitched upon

were able to resist them all in the situation we were then
in. Thus we spent the day in debates of what we should
do ; but toward evening we found that the number of our
enemies still increased, and we did not know but by the
morning they might still be a greater number : so I be-
gan to inquire of those people we had brought from Tobol-
ski if there were no private ways by which we might avoid
them in the night, and perhaps retreat to some town, or
get help to guard us over the desert. The young lord‘s

orders, he would lose his life if he did not perform it ; we
soon brought his lord to give that order, though privately,

river being navigable, in seven da 5' passage, to Arch-

July; and providing ourselves with two luggage boats, and
a barge for our own convenience, we embarked the 7th,

our stay of about eight months at Tobolski.
We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the
arrival of the ships, and must have tarried longer, had not
a Hamburgher come in above a month sooner than any of
the English ships; when, after some consideration that the
city of Hamburgh might happen to be as good a market
for our goods as London, we all took freight with him;

not be seen in the city, where some of the Moscow mere

safe in the Elbe the 18th of September. Here my partner

Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went
up the Elbe, in order to go to the court of Vienna,
where he resolved to seek protection, and could cor-

I embarked in the packet, and arrived in London the
10th of January 1705, having been absent from Eng-
land ten years and nine months. And here, resolving to
harass myself no more, I am preparing for a longer
journey than all these, having lived seventy-two years a
