A team of students led by UNC-CH graduate student Grant Glass looked at finding computational approaches to track some of the thousands of editions of Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe – including the plethora of “Robinsoniades,” most of which are deviations from Defoe’s original work. By examining the differences in these stories and editions –through word-vector models and categorization algorithms, we can trace how the deviations often reflect the place and time of their production and consumption.
