PREFACEj 

If ever the story of any private man’s ad 
ventures in the world were worth making 
public, and were acceptable when published, 
t}>e Editor of this account thinks this will 
be so. 

The wonders of this man’s life exceed all 
that the thinks) is to be found extant; the 
life of one man being scarce capable of a great- 
er variety. 

The story is told with modesty, with seri- 
ousness, and with a religious application of 
events, to the uses to which wise men always 
apply them, viz. to the instruction of others 
by this example, and to justify and honour 
the wisdom of Providence in all the variety 
of our circumstances^ let them happen how 
they will.'

PREFACE. 


The Editor believes this narrative to be a 
just history of fact; iieitlier is there any ap- 
pearance of fiction in it; and though he is 
well aware there are many, who, on account 
of the very singular preservations the Author 
met with, will give it tJie name of a romance ; 
yeb in which ever of these lights it shall be 
viewed, he imagines, that the improvement 
of it, as well as the diversion, as to the in- 
struction of the reader, will be the same, 
and as such, he thinks, without fiwther com- 
pliment to the world, he does them great 
service in the publication. 



THE 


LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

OF 

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

I WAS born at York, iti the year >1032, of a reputable fa- 
mily. My father was a native of Bremen, who by^iner- 
cliaiKliziii^- at Hull for some time, gained a very plentiful 
1‘ortune. He married my mother at York, who received 
her tirst breatli in that country ; and as her maiden name 
was Robinson, 1 was called Robinson Ky ciitznaer ; which 
not being easily pronounced in the English tongue, we are 
commonly known by the name of (’rusoe. 

I was the youngest of three brothers. The eldest was a 
lieutenant -colonel in Lockhart^s regiment, but slain by the 
Spaniards : v\hat became of the other I could never learn. 

No charge or pains were wanting in my educijlion. — 
My father designed me for the law, yet nothing would 
serve me but I must go to sea, both against the will of my 
father, the tears of my mother, and the entreaties of friends. 
One morning my father expostulated very warmly with me : 
What reason, says he, have you to leave your native coun- 
try, where there must be a more certain prospect of con- 
tent and happiness, to enter into a wandering condition of 
uneasiness and uncertainty ? He recommended to me 
Augur's wish, ‘‘Neither to desire poverty nor riches;” 
that a middle state of life was the most happy, and that 
the high towering thoughts of raising our condition by wan- 
dering abroad, were surrounded with misery and danger, 
and often ended with confusion and disappointment. 1 
entreat you, nay, I command you, (says lie^) to desist from 
these intentions. Consider your elder brother, who laid 
down his life for Ids honoiy, or rather lost it for his disobe- 
dience to my will. If you will go, (added he,) my prayers, 
shalLliowever be offered for your preservation ; but a time 
nuiy come, when desolate, oppressed,' or forsaken, you

may wish you had taken your poor despised father’s counsel. 
He^pronoun#ed these words with such a moving and pater- 
nal eloquence, while floods of tears ran down his aged cheeks, 
that it seemed to stem the torrent of my resolutions. But 
this soon wore ofl*, and a little after 1 informed my mother, 
that I could not settle to any business, my resolutions were 
so strong to see the world ; and begged slie would gain my 
father s consent only to go one voyage 5 which il it did not 
prove prosperous, I would never attempt a second. But my 
desire was as vain as my folly in asking. My mother pas- 
sionately expressed her dislike of this proposal, telling me 
That as she saw 1 w^as bent upon my own destruction, con- 
trary to their will and my duty, she would say no more, 
but leave me to myself to do whatever 1 pleased.’’ 

I was then, 1 think, nineteen years old, when one time be- 
ing at Hull, 1 met a school-fellow^ of mine going along with 
his father, who w as a master of a sliij), to London ; and ac- 
quainting him witli my wandering desires, he assured me of 
a free passage, and a plentiful share of w hat was necessary. 
Thus, without imploring a blessing, or taking fargweli ot 7ny 
parents, I took shipping on the first of September, 1651. We 
set sail soon after, au(l our ship had scarce left the Humbei 
a-stern, when there arose so violent a storm, that being ex- 
tremely sea-sick, 1 concluded the judgment of God deserv- 
edly followed me for my disobedience to my dear jiafcmls. 
It was then 1 called to mind the good advice of my father; 
bow easy and comfortable was a middle state of life ; and 
J firmly resolved, if it pleased God to set me on dry laml 
once more, I would return to my parents, implore their for- 
giveness, and bid a final adieu to my w andering inclinations. 

Such were my thoughts while the storm continued ; but 
these good resolutions decreased with the danger j more 
especially when my companion came to me,^ clapping me on 
the shoulder : What, Bob said he, sure you was not 
“ frightened last night with scarce a capful of wind?” — 
“ And do you,” cried I, “call such a violent storm a capful 
“ of wind “ A storm, you fool you !” said lie, “ this is 110- 
“ thing : a good ship and sea-room always baffles such a 
“ foolish squall of wind as that : But you’re a firesh-water 
sailor t Come boy, turn ouL se^ what fine weather we have 
“ now, and a good bowl of punch will d^own all your past 
“ sorrows.” In short, the punch was made, I was drunk, aud 
in one night’s time drowne^T both my repentaugf. and my

good resolutions, forgetting entirely the vows and promises 
I made in my distress : and whenever any reflections would 
return on me, what by company, and what by drinking, 1 
soon mastered those fits, as 1 deridingly called them. But 
this only made way for another trial, whereby 1 could not 
but see how much 1 was beholden to kind Providence. 

Upon the sixth day we came to an anchor in Harwich 
road, where we lay wind-bound with some Newcastle ships ; 
and there being good anchorage, and our cables sound, the 
seamen forgot their late toil and danger, aiicf spent the time 
as merry as if they had been on shore. But on the eighth 
day there arose a brisk gale of wind, wiiicli prevented our 
tiding it up the river; and still increasing, our ship rode 
forecastle in, and shipped several large seas. • 

It was not long before horror seized the seamen them- 
selves, and 1 heard the master express this melancholy 
ejaculation, ** Lord have mercy upon us, we shall be all lost 
and undone 1” For my part, sick unto death, 1 kept my cabin, 
till the universal and terribly dreadful apprehensions of our 
speedy fate made me get upon deck ; and there I was af- 
frighted indeed. The sea went mountains high ; 1 could 
see nothing but distress around us; two ships had cut their 
masts on board, and another was foundered ; two more that 
had lost their anchors, were forced out to the mercy of the 
t»ceari : and to save our lives we were forced to cut our 
foremast and mainmast quite away. 

Who is there so ignorant as not to judge of my dreadful 
condition i I was but a fresh-water sailor, and therefore it 
seemed more terrible. Our ship was very good, but over- 
loaded ; which made the sailors often cry out, “ She would 
“ founder!” Words 1 then was ignorant of. All this while 
the storm continuing, and rather increasing, the master and 
the most sober part of his men went to prayers, expecting 
death every moment. In the middle of the night one cried 
out, We had sprung a leak !’’ another, “ That there were 
foui feet water in the hold !” I was just ready to exjmre 
with fear, when immediately all hands were called to tBie 
pump ; and the men forced me also in that extremity to 
share with tlieni in I heir labour. While thus employed, the 
master espyiug some light*colUers, fired a gun as a signal of 
distress ; and I, not understanding what it meant, and think- 
ing that either the ship broke, or some dreadful thing hap- 
pened, fell into a swoon ^ Even in that common condition

of woe, nobody minded me, excepting to thrust me aside 
with their feel, thinking me dead, and it was a great while 
before I recovered. 

Happy it was for us, when upon the signal given, they 
ventured out their boats to save our li\e.s. All our j)umping 
had been in vain, and vain had all our attempts been, had they 
not come to our ship’s side, and our men cast them a rope over 
the stern with a buoy to it, which after great labour they got 
hold of, and we liaujing them up to us, got into their boat, 
and left our ship, which we percei\ed sink within less than a 
quarter of an hour ; and thus 1 learned what was meant by 
foundering at sea. And now the men incessantly laboured to 
recover their own sliip j but the sea ran so high and the wind 
blew so hard, that they thought it convenient to h^e within 
shore ; which, with great dilhculty and danger, at last we 
happily effected, landing at a place called Cromer y not far 
from Winterton light-house from whence we all walked to 
Yarmouth, where as objects of j>ity, many good people fur- 
nished us with necessaries to carry us either to Hull or London. 

Strange, after all tliis, like the procUgal son, I did not re- 
turn to my fathci'j who hearing of the chip’s calamity, for a 
long time thought me entoinbcd in the deep. No doubt 
but I should have shared on his fatted calfy as the Scripture 
expresseth it; but my ill fate sldl pushed me on, in spite of 
the powerful convictions of reason and conscience. 

When we had been at Yarmouth three days, I met my 
old companion, who had given me the invitation to go on 
board along with his fatlier. His behaviour and speech 
were altered, and in a melancholy manner asked me how 1 
did, telling his father who I was, and how 1 had made this 
i'oyage, only for a trial to proceed further abroad. Upon 
which the old gentleman turning to me gravely, said, 
“ Young man you ought never to go to sea any more, but to 
“ take this for a certain sign that you never w ill prosper in 
‘‘ a seafaring condition.'" “ Sir,” answered 1, will you 
“ take the same resolution? “ It is a different case, ” said 
he; “ it is my calling and consequently my duty; but as 
“ you have made this voyage for a trial, you see what ill 
** success ileaven basset before your eyes ; and perhaps 
“ our miseries have been on your'Uccount, like Jonah in the 
“ ship of farshish. But pray what are you ? and on what 
“ account did yoii go to sea Upon which I very freely 
declared my whole story ; at the eiiil of which he made this

exclamation, “ Yea sacred Powers, what had I committed, 
“ that sucli a wretch sliould enter into my ship^o heap upon 
“me sucli a delude of miseries !”y lUit soon recollecting 
his passion, Young man,” said he, if you do not go back, 
“ dejiend upon il, wherever 3011 go, you will meet with dis- 
“ asters and disa})pointments till your father’s words are 
“ fulliiled upon 3 on.” And so we parted. 

1 thought at lirst to return home; but shame opposed that 
good motion, as lliinking I should l;e laughed at by my neigh- 
bours ami acquaintance. So strange is the nature of youth, 
who art‘ not ashamed to sin, lint yet ashamed to repent; and 
so fiu- (Vom being asiiamed of those actions for which tiiey 
may be accounted fools, they think it folly to return to then- 
duty, which is the principal mark of v\isdom. In short, J 
travelled up to Loudon, resolving upon a voyage; ami a 
voyage I soon licard of, by my acquaintance with a Captain 
who look a fancy to me, to go to the coast of (jtiiim’a. f lav- 
ing some mom V and a{>pearing like a gentleman, I went 
on hoard not as a common sailor or foremast man ; nay, 
the eomnmnder agreed 1 should go the voyage vvitli him 
without any exjieuse ; that 1 sliould be his mesi^nale ami 
companion, ami I was very welcome to cairry any tiling 
with me, and make the best mcn-elrandise I could. 

1 blessed my happy fortune, and humbly thanked my cap- 
tain for this olTer 3 and acquainting my friends in Yorkshire, 
foilv pounds were sent me, the greatest jiart of wliieh my 
ticai father and mother contributed to, with which 1 bought 
toys amt trifles, as the captain directed me. JVIy captain 
also taught me navigation, how to keep an account of the 
ship’s course, take an observation, and led me into tlie know- 
ledge of several useful branches of the matheniaties. And 
indeed this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant ; 
for I hiought home live pounds nine ounces of gold dust for 
my adventure, which produced at my return to London, 
almost three hundred pounds. But in this voyage 1 was ex- 
tiernely sick, being thrown into a violent cakmture ihrongh 
the excessive heat, trading niion the coast from the latitude 
of fifteen degrees north, even to llie line itself. 

But alas ! inv dear friend, the captain soon departed this 
life after his arrival. This was a sensible grief to me : vet 
I resolved to go another voyage witli his mate, who had 
now got command oi the ship. This proved a very uiisuc- 
cesgful one ; for though 1 did not carry quite a hundred

pounds of late acquired wealth, (so that I had two hun- 
dred pounds left, which I reposed with the Captain's widow, 
who was an honest gentlewoman,) yet my misfortunes in 
this unhappy voyage were very great. For our ship sailing 
towards the Canary islands, we were chased by a Salee 
rover ; and in spite of all the haste we could make, by crowd- 
ing as much canvas as our yards could spread, or our masts 
carry, the pirate gained upon us, so that we prepared our- 
selves to fight. They had eighteen guns, and we had but 
twelve. About three in tlie afternoon there was a desperate 
engagement, wherein many were killed and wounded on 
both sides; but finding ourselves overpowered with num- 
bers, ‘ our ship disabled, and ourselves to impotent to have 
the least hopes of success, we were forced to surrender ; and 
accordingly were all carried prisoners into the port of Salee. 
Our men were sent to the ^Lmperor's court to be sold there ; 
but the pirate captain taking notice of me, kept me to be 
ins owu slave. 

In this condition, I thought myself the most miserable 
creature on earth, and the prophecy of my father ouine afresh 
into my thoughts. However, my condition was better than 
1 thought it to be, as will soon appear. Some hopes indeed 
1 had that my new patron would go to sea again, where he 
might be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese man of war, and 
then I should be set at liberty. But in this I was mistaken 3 
for he never took me with him, but left me to look after his 
little garden, and do the drudgery of his house; and when he 
returned from sea, would make me lie in the cabin, and 
look after the ship. I had no one that 1 could communicate 
my thoughts to, which were continually meditating my 
escape ; no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman here, but 
myself ; and for two y^rs 1 could see nothing practicable, 
but only pleased myself with the imagination. 

After some length of time, my patron as I found, grew so 
poor that he could not fit out his ship as usual ; and then he 
used constantly, once or twice a week, if the weather was 
fair, to go out a fishing, taking me and a young Moresco boy 
to row the boat ; and so much pleased was he with me for 
my dexterity in catching the fis]^, that he would often send 
roe with a Moor, who was one of his kinsmen^ and the Mo- 
resco youth, to catch a dish of fish for him. 

One mpruing as we were at the sport, there arose such' 
a thick fog that we lost sight of the shore ; and sowing we 



<XF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^1, 

knew not which way, we laboured all the flight, and iii the 
morning found ourselves in the ocean, two^lea»gues from 
land. However, we attained there at length, and made the 
greater haste, because our stomachs were exceedingly sharp 
and hungry. In order to prevent such disasters for the 
future, my patron ordered a carpenter to build a little state 
room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat, with a place 
behind it to steer and Imle home the main sheet, with other 
conveniences to keep in from the weather ; as also lockers 
to put in all manner of provisions, with(a handsome slioul- 
der of mutton sail, gibing over the cabin.) 

In this he frequently took us out a tishing j and one time 
inviting two or three persons of distinction to go with him, 
made provisions extraordinary, providing also three fusees, 
with powder and shot, that they might have some sport at 
Ibwling along the sea-coast. The next morning the boat 
was made clean, her ancient and pendants out, and every 
thing ready ; but their minds altering, my patron ordered 
us to go a fishing, for that bis guests would certainly sup 
with him that night. 

And now I began to think of my deliverance indeed. In 
order to this 1 j)ersuaded the Moor to get some provisions 
on board as not daring to meddle with our patron’s j and 
he taking my advice, we stored Ourselves with rusk biscuit, 
and three jars of water. Besides, I privately conveyed 
into the boat a bottle of brandy, some twine, thread, a ham- 
mer, hatchet, and a saw; and, in particular, some bees-wax, 
which was a great comfort to me, and served to make can- 
dles. 1 then persuaded Muley (for so was the Mocr called) 
to procure some powder and shot, pretending to kill sea cur- 
lews, which he innocently and readily agreed to. In short, 
being provided with all things necessary, we sailed out, re- 
solving for my own part to make my escape, though it should 
cost me my life. 

When we had passed the castle, we fell a fishings but 
though I knew there was a bite, 1 dissembled the matter, in 
order to put out further to sea. Accordingly we ran a league 
further; when giving the boy the heliiv, and pretending to 
stoop for something, 1 seized Muley by surprise and threw 
him overboard. As he was an excellent swimmer, he soon 
arose, and made towards the boat j upon which, I took out 
a fttsee, and presented at him; “ Muley” said I, “ 1 never 

yet designed to do you any harm, and seek nothing now

** but my redemption. I know you are able enough to swim 
“ to shore, aj^d save your life ; but if you are resolved to 
“ follow me, to the endangering of mine, the very moment 
“ you proceed, I will shoot you through the head.’' The 
harmless, creature at these words, turnefl himself from me, 
and 1 make no doubt got safe to land. Then turning to the 
boy Xury, 1 perceived he trembled at the action ; but I put 
him out of all fear, telling him, that if he would be true and 
faithful to me, I would do well by him. “ And therefore,” 
said I, “ you must stroke your face to be faithful ; and as the 

Turks have learned you, swear by Mahoanet, and the beard 
** of your father, or else I will throw you into the sea also.” 
So innocent did the child then look, and with such an oblig- 
ing smile consented, that 1 readily believed him, and from 
that day forward began to love him entirely. 

We then pursued our voyage; and lest they should think 
me gone to the straits’ mouth, I kept to the southward to 
the truly Barbarian coast; but in the dusk of the evening, I 
changed my course, and steering directly S. and by E. that I 
might keep near the shore; and having a fresh gale of wind, 
with a pleasant smooth sea, by three o’clock next day, 1 was 
one hundred and fifty miles beyond the Emperor of Morocco’s 
dominions. Yet still having the dreadful apprehension of 
being retaken, I continued sailing for five days successively, 
till such time as the wind shifting to the southward, made me 
conclude, that if any vessel was in chase of me, they would 
proceed no farther. After so much fatigue and thought, I 
ancliored at the mouth of a little river, I knew not what or 
w here ; neither did I then see any people. What I principally 
wanted was fresh water; and 1 was resolved about dusk to 
swim asliAre. But no sooner did the gloomy clouds of night 
begin* to succeed the declining day, when we heard such 
barking, roaring, and holding of wild creatures, that one 
might have thought the very strongest monster of nature, or 
infernal spirits had their residence there. Poor Xury, almost 
dead with fear, entreated me not to go on shore that night. 
“ Supposing I don’t Xury,’’ saidl “ and in the morning we 
“ siiould see men who are w'orse than those we fear, what 
“ thenT' “O den we may give dem de shoot gun/’ replied 
XuiT, laughing, “ and de gun mak^ dera all run away.” The 
wit and broken English, which the boy had learned among the 
captives of our nation, pleased me entirely ; and to add to His 
cheerfulness, I gave him a dram of the bottle. We could get

but little sleep all the night for those tertible howling^, they 
made 3 and indeed, we were both very much afl 5 ;ighted, when, 
by the rolling of the water, and other tokens, we justly con- 
cluded one of those monsters made towards our boat. I could 
not see, till it came within two oars length, w hen taking my 
fusee, I let fly at him. Whether I hit him or no I cannot 
tell ; but he made towards the shore, and the noise of my 
gun increased the stuj)endous noise of the monsters. 

The next morning I was resolved to go on shore to get 
fresh water, and venture my life among the beasts 01 savages, 
should either attack me. Xury said, he would take one of 
the jars and bring me some. 1 asked him, why he would 
go, and notl? The poor boy answered, “ if w ild mans come, 
they eat me, you go away!^ A mind scarcely now* to be 
imitated, so contrary to self-preservation, the most powerful 
law of Nature. This, indeed, increased my affections to the 
child. “ Well, dear Xury,’’ said I “ w e will both go ashore, 
both kill w ild mans, and they shall eat neither of us.’’ So 
giving Xury a piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram, we 
waded ashore, carrying nothing with us but our arms, and 
tw o jars of water. I did not go out of sight of the boat, as 
dreading the savages coming dow n the river in their canoes ; 
but the boy seeing a low descent or vale about a mile in the 
country, he wandered to it: and then running back to me 
with great precipitation, 1 thought he was pursued by some 
savage or wild beast 3 upon which 1 approached, resolving 
to perish or protect him from danger. As he came nearer 
to me, 1 saw' something hanging: over his shoulders, which 
was a creature he had shot Tike a hare, but diflerent in colour, 
and longer legs ; how ever we were glad of it, for it proved 
wholesome and nourishing meat: but what added to our joy 
was, my boy assured me there was plenty of water, and that 
he see no wild mans. And greater still w as our comfort when - 
the tide was out, without going so far up in the country. 

In this place I began to consider that the Canary and Cape 
de Verde islands lay not far off; but having no instrument, 

I knew not what latitude, or when to stand off to sea, for 
them ; yet my hopes were 1 should meet some of the Eng- 
lish trading vessels, who would relieve and take us in. 

The place 1 was in wais no doubt that wild country, in- 
habited only by a few', that lies between the Emperor of 
Morocco’s dominions and the Negroes. It is filled with 
%vUcj beasts, and the Moors use it fot hunting chiefly. From 



14 ' LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

/ 

this place I thought I saw the top of the mountain Teneriff 
in the , Canaries ; which made me try twice to attain it; 
but as often was I drove back, and So forced to pursue my 
fortune along shore. 

Early one morning we came to an anchor under a little 
poini of land, but pretty high : and the tide beginning to 
flow, we lay ready to go further '^in. But Xury, whose 
youthful and penetrating eyes were sharper than mine, in a 
a[oft tone, desired me to keep far from land, lest we should 
be devoured, For look yonder, master,” said he, “ and see 

de dreadful monster fast asleep on de side of de hill.” — 
Accordingly looking where he pointed, I espied a fearful 
monster indeed. It was a terrible great lion that lay on 
shore covered as it were by a shade of a piece of the hill. 
“ Xury,” said 1, ** you shall go on shore and kill him.” But 
the boy looking amazed : “ Me kill him 1” says he, “ he eat 
me at one mouth meaning one mouthful. Upon which 1 
bid him lie still, and charging my biggest gun with two 
slugs, and a good charge of powder, I took the best aim 1 
could to shoot him through the head but his leg lying over 
his nose, the slug broke his knee bone. The lion awaking 
with the pain, got up, but soon fell down, giving the most 
hideous groan 1 ever heard : but taking my second piece, 
I shot him through the head, and then he lay struggling for 
life. Upon this Xury took heart, and desired my leave to 
go on shore. ‘‘ Go llien,” said 1. Upon which taking a 
little gun ill one hand, he swam to shore with the other, and 
coming close to the lion, put a period to his life by shooting 
him agaiti through the hea3t 

But this was spending our ammunition in vain, the desh 
not being good to cat, Xury was like a champion, and 
comes on board for a hatchet, to cut off the head of bis ene- 
my ; but not having strength to perform it, he cut oif and 
brought me a foot. I bethought me, however, that his skin 
would be of use. This work cost Xury and me a whole 
day ; when spreading it on the top of our cabin, the hot 
beams of the sun effectually dried it in two days’ time, and 
it afterwards served me for a bed to lie on. 

And now we sailed southerly, living sparingly on our pro- 
vtalons, and went no oftener on shore than we were obliged 
for fresh water. My design was to make the river Gambia 
or Senegal, or any where about the Cape de Verde, in hopes 
to meet some Europeah ship. If Providence did not so fa^ 



15 


vour me, my next course was to seek for the islands, or lose 
my life amongst the Negroes. And, in a word, I put m\ 
whole stress upon this, “ Either that I must meet with 
some ship, or certainly perish.” 

One day as we were sailing along, we saw people stand 
on the shore looking at us j we could also perceive they 
were black and stark naked. I was inclined to go on shore, 
but Xury cried, No no however, 1 approached nearer, 
and 1 found they run along the shore by me a good way. 
They had no weapons in their hands, except one, who held 
a long stick, which Xury told me was a lance, with which 
they could kill at a great distance. I talked to them by 
signs, and made them sensible 1 wanted something to eat ; 
they beckoned me to stop my boat, while two of them ran 
up into the country, and in less than half an hour came back, 
and brought with them two pieces of dried flesh and some 
corn, which we kindly accepted ; and to prevent any fears 
on either side, they brought the food to the shore, laid it 
down, then went and stood a great way off till we fetched 
it on.h^ard, and then came close to us again. 

But while we were returning thanks to them, being all we 
could afford, two mighty creatures came from the mountains ; 
one as it were pursuing the other with great fury, which we 
were the rather inclined to believe, as they seldom appear 
but in the night ; and both these swiftly passing by the Ne- 
groes, jumped into the sea, wantonly swimming about, as 
though the diversion of the waters had put a stop to their fierce- 
ness. At last one of them coming nearer to my boat than I 
expected or desired, I shot him directly through the bead ; 
upon which he sunk immediately, yet rising again, would 
have willingly made the shore ; but between the wound and 
the strangling of the water, he died before he could reach it. 

It is impossible to express the consternation the poor Ne- 
groes were in at the firing of my gun ; much less cam 1 men- 
tion their surprise, when tljM^erceived the creature to be 
slam by it. 1 made signsito them to draw near it with 
rope, and then gave it them lo hale on shore. It was a beau- 
tiful leopard, which made me desire its skin, and the Ne- 
groes seeming to covet the carcase, I freely gave it to them. 
As for the other leopard, it made to shore, and ran with pro- 
digious swiftness out of sight. The Negroes having kindly 
furnished me with water, and with, What roots and grains 
Uieir country afforded, 1 took my leave, and after oktnn

days sail, came in sight of the Cape de Verde, and those 
islands called by its name. But the great distance I was from 
it, and fearing contrary winds would prevent my reaching 
them, I began to grow melancholy and dejected, when, upon 
a sudden, Xury cried out, “ Master ! Master ! a ship with a 
sail !” and looking as affrighted as if it was his master's ship 
sent in search of us. But I soon discovered she was a Por- 
tuguese ship, as 1 thought bound to the coast of Guinea for 
Negroes. Upon which I strove for life to come up to them. 
But vain had it been, if through their perspective glasses they 
had not perceived me and shortened their sail to let me come 
up. Encouraged at this, I set up my patron’s ancient, and 
tired a gun, both as signals of distress ; upon which they 
very kindly lay too, so that in three hours time I came uj) 
with them. They spoke to me in Portuguese, Spanish, and 
French, but none of these did I understand ; till at length 
a Scots sailor called, and then 1 told him I was an English- 
inan, who h’Jid escaped from the Moors at Salee ; upon 
which they took me kindly on board, with all my elfocts. 

Surely none can express the inconceivable joy * felt at 
this happy deliverance 1 who from being a late miserable 
and forlorn creature, was not only relieved, but in favour 
with the master of the ship, to whom in return for my de- 
liverance, 1 offered all I had. God forbid,’' said he, 
** that I should take any thing from you. Every thing shall 
be^delivered to you when you come to Brazil. If I have 
“ saved your life, it is no more than I should expect to re- 
Ceive myself from any other, when in the same circum- 
** stance I should happen to meet the like deliverance.-— 
“ And should 1 take from you what you ha^e, and leave you 
“ at Brazil, why, this would be only taking away a life I 
“ had gi^ en. My charity teaches me better. Those effects 
you have will support )Oii there, and provide you a pas- 
“ sage home again.'’ And, indeed, he acted with the strict- 
est justice in what he did, taking my things into his posses- 
sion, vtiid giving me an exact inventory, even to my earthen 
jars. He bought my boat of me for the ship’s use, giving 
me a hole of eighty pieces of eight, payable, at Brazil ; and 
if any body offered more he would make it up. Ho also 
gave me sixty pieces for my boy X!jry. It was w ith great 
reluctance I was prevailed upon to sell the child’s liberty, 
who had served me so faithfully ; but the boy was willing’ 
; and it was agreed, that after ten years he should 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 17 

be made free, upon his renouncing Mahometanism, and 
embracing Christianity. 

Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils, we arrived in 
the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints Bay, in twenty- 
two days after. And here I cannot forget the generous 
treatment of the captain. He would take nothing for my 
passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's skin, and 
thirty for the lion’s. • Every thing he caused to be delivered, 
and what I would sell he bought. In short 1 made about 
220 pieces of my cargo j and with this stock I entered 
once more, as I may say, into the scene of life. 

Being recommended to an honest planter, I lived with 
him till such time as 1 was informed of the manner of their 
planting and making sugar ; and seeing how well? they 
lived, and how suddenly they grew rich, I was filled with a 
desire to settle among them, and resolved to get my money 
remitted to me, and to purchase a plantation. 

To be brief, I bought a settlement next door to , an honest 
and kind neighbour, born at Lisbon, of English parents, 
whose pj^tation joining to mine, we improved it very ami- 
cably together. Both our stocks were low, and for two 
years we planted only for food : but the third year we 
planted some tobacco, and each of us dressed a large piece 
of ground the ensuing year for planting canes. But now 
I found how much 1 wanted assistance, and repented the 
loss of my dear boy Xury. 

Having none to assist me, my father's words came into 
my mind j and I used to ask myself, if what I sought was a 
only a middle station of life, why could it not as well be ob- 
tained in England as here ? When I pondered on this with 
regret, the thoughts of my late deliverance forsook me. 1 
had none to converse with but my neighbour ; no work to be 
done but by my own hands j it often made me say, my con- 
dition was like to that of a man cast upon a desolate island. 
So unhappy are we in our reflections, so forgetful of what 
good things we receive ourselves, and so unthankful for 
our deliverance from those calamities that others endure. 

I was in some measure settled, before the captain who 
tn^ up departed from the Brazils. One day 1 went to 
l^ttAnd told him what stock 1 had in London, desiring hiir 
Iplljhiice in getting it remitted ; to which the good gentle* 
p|tm readily consented, but would only have me send for 
half my money, lest it should miscarrv : whi/?b if it did I 



18 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

might still have the remainder to support me : and so tak- 
ing letters of procuration of me, bid me trouble myself no 
ivrther about it. 

And indeed wonderful was his kindness towards me ; for 
he not only procured the money I had drawn for upon ray 
captain's widow, but sent me over a servant with a cargo 
proportionable to my condition. He also sent hie over 
tools of all sorts, iron-work, and utensils necessary for my^ 
plantation which proved to be of the greatest use to me 
in my business. 

Wealth now accumulating on me, and uncommon success 
crowning my prosperous labours, I might have rested happy 
in that middle stale of life my father had so often recom- 
mended j yet nothing would content me, such was my evil 
genius, but I must leave this happy station, for a foolish am- 
bition in rising ; and thus, once more, I cast myself into the 
greatest gulf of misery that ever a poor creature fell into. 
Having lived four years in Brazil, I had not only learned 
the language, but contracted acquaintance with the most 
eminent planters, and even the merchants of St. Salvador ; 
to whom, once, by way ot discourse, having given an account 
of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea, and the manner 
of trading there for mere trifles, by which we furnish our 
plantations with Negroes, they gave such attention to what 1 
said, that three of them came one morning to me, and told 
me they had a secret proposal to make. After enjoining me 
to secrecy, (it being an infiiiigemeiit on the powers of the 
kings of Portugal and Spain,) they told me they had a mind 
to fit out a ship to go to Guinea, in order to stock the plan- 
tation with Negroes, which as they could not be publicly 
sold, they would divide among them ; and if I would go 
their super-cargo in the ship to manage the trading part, 1 
should have an equal share of the Negroes, without provid- 
ing any stock. The thing indeed was fair enough, had 1 
been in another condition. But 1 was born to be my own 
destroyer, I could not resist the proposal, but accepted the 
offer upon condition of their looking afier my plantation. So 
making a formal will, 1 bequeathed my effects to my good 
friend the captain, as my universal heir ; but obliged hiia 
to dispose of ni^ effects as directed, one half of the prodjUf^, 
to llimsclf, and the other to be shipped to England. 

jThe ship being fitted out, and all things re^dy, we

years I left my father and motlier in Yorkshire. We sailed 
northward upon the coast, in order to gain Africa, till we 
made Cape Augustine ; from whence going farther into the 
ocean out of siglit of land, we steered as 1 hough we were 
bound for (he Isle Fernand de Norenba, leaving the islands 
on the east ; and tlien it was that we met with a terrible 
tempest, which continued for twelve days successively, so 
that the winds carried us wheresoever they j)leased. Ill this 
perplexity one of our men died, and one mail and a boy 
were washed overboard. When the wcatlier cleared up a 
little, we found ourselves in eleven degrees north latitude, 
upon the coast of Guinea. Upon this the captain gave i-ca- 
sons for ictui;ning ; w hich I opposed, counselling him to stand 
away for Barhadoes, which, as I siipjiosed, might benttaiiied 
in fifteen days. So altering our course, w'e sailed north- 
west and by west, in order to reach the Lecw'ard islands ; 
but a second storm succeeding, drove us to the westward j 
so (hat we were justly afraid of falling into the hands of 
cruel savages, or the paws of devouring beasts of prey. 

In tj\js great distress, one of our men, early in the morn- 
ing, cried out, Laud, laud !” which he had uo sooner said, 
but our slop struck upon a sand-hank, and in a iiionicnt 
the sea broke over Iier in such a manner, that we expected 
we should all iiave perished immediately. We knew no- 
thing where we were, or upon what land we were driven ; 
w'hcther an island or the main, inhahited or not iniiahiled; 
and we could not so much as hope that the ship would hold out 
many minutes, witliout breaking in pieces, except the wind, 
by a miracle, should Inrii about iniined lately. While we 
stood -looking at one another, expecting death every moment, 
the mate lavs hohl of the boat, and with (he lielp of the rest 
got her flung over the ship’s sitle, and getting all into her, 
being eleven of us, committed ourselves lo God s mercy and 
llie wiht sea. And now we saw that this last efl’ort would 
not be suflicieiit prolcclioii from <icath ; so high dhl the sea 
rise, that it was impossible the boat should live. As to 
making a sail, we had none ; iieillier if wc lia<l, could we 
make use of any. So that when we had rci»ved, or rather 
were <lriveii ahout-a league and a half, a raging like 

a lofty mountain, came* rolling a-sterii of us, ptio^Huok tia 
with such fury, that at once it overset the boat. :^ Thu» being 
swallowed up in a inoinent, we had lianily time to call upon 
the treimmdous name of God ; iiiucli less to implore, in

LIFE AND ADVENTURES 


Men are generally counted insensible Vvhen struggling in 
the pangs of death ; but while 1 was overwhelmed with 
water, 1 had the most dreadful apprehensions imaginable. 
For the jo)s of heaven and the torments of hell, seemed to 
present themselves before me in these dying agonies, and 
even small space of time, as it were, between life and death. 
I was going I thought I knew not whither, into a dismal 
gulf unknown, and as yet unperceived, never to behold 
my friends, nor the light of this world any more ! Could I 
even have thought of annihilation, or a total dissolution of 
soul as well as body, the gloomy thoughts of having no far- 
ther being, no knowledge of what we hoped for, but an 
eternal quietus^ without life or sense : even that, I say, 
would liHve been enough to stri'ke me with hon’or and* con- 
fusion ! I strove, however, to the last extremity, while all 
my companions were overpowered and entombed in the 
deep : and it was w itli great ditticulty 1 kept my breath till 
the wave spent itself, and retiring back, left me on the shore 
half dead w ith tlie water I had taken in. As soon as 1 got 
on my feet, I ran as fast as 1 could, lest another wave 
should pursue me, and carry me back again. Bift-for all 
the baste I made, 1 could not avoid it ; for the sea came 
after me like a high mountain, or furious enemy ; so that 
my business was to hold my breath, and by raising myself 
oil the water, preserve it by swimming. The next dread- 
ful wave buried me at once twenty or thirty feet deep, but at 
the same time carried me with a mighty force and swiftness 
towards the shore ; when raising myself, I held out as w'eli 
as possible, till at length the water having spent itself, be- 
gan to return, at which 1 struck forward, and feeling ground 
with my. feet I took to my heels again. Thus being served 
twice more, I w as at length dashed against a piece of rock, 
in such a manner as lelt me senseless ; but recovering a 
little before the return of the wave, which, no doubt, would 
then have overw helmed me, I held fast by the rock till those 
succeeding waves abated j and then fetching another run, 
was overtaken by a small wave, which was soon conquered. 
But before any more could overtake me, I reached th*e niaiu 
land, when clambering up the clifts of the shore, tired and 
almost spent I sat down on the gr^ss, free from the dangers 
of the foaming ocean. 

No tongue can express the ecstasies and transpohs that 
iny soul felt at the happy deliverance. It was like a reprieve 



OF ROBINSOK CRUSOE. Hi 

to a dying itialefaclor, with a halter about his neck, and 
ready to be turned off. I was wrapt up in contemplation, 
and often lifted up my hands, witli the profoundest humility, 
to the Divine Powers, for saving my life, when the rest cf 
iny companions were all drowned. And now I began to 
cast my eyes around, to behold what place I was in, and 
what 1 had next to do. I could see no house nor people ; I 
was wet, yet had np clothes to shift me ; hungry and thirsty, 
yet had nothing to eat or drink j no weapon to destroy any 
creatures for iny sustenance, nor defend myself against de- 
vouring beasts; in short, I had nothing but a knife, a 
tobacco pipe, and a box half filled with tobacco. The 
darksome night coming upon me, increased my fears of 
being devoured by wild creatures ; 'my mind was, plunged 
in despair, and having no prospect, as 1 thought, of life be- 
fore me, 1 prepared for another kind of death than what I 
had lately escaped. I walked about a furlong to see if I 
could find any fresh water, which I did to my great joy; 
and taking a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger, I got up 
into a thick bushy tree, and seating myself so that 1 could 
not firtf; a deep sleep overtook me, and for that night buried 
niy sorrows in a quiet repose. 

It was broad day the next morning before I awaked ; 
when I not only perceived the tempest was ceased, but saw 
the ship driven almost as far as the rock before-mentioned, 
which the waves had dashed me against, and which was 
about a mile from the place where 1 was. When 1 came 
down from my apartment in the tree, I perceived the ship's 
boat two miles distant on niy right-hand, lying on shore, as 
the waves had cast her. I thought to have got to her ; but 
there being an inlet of water of about half a mile’s breadth 
betAveen it and me, 1 returned again towards the ship, as 
hoping to find something for my more immediate subsist- 
ence. About noon, when the sea w'as calm, that 1 could come 
within a quarter of a mile of her, it was to my grief that I 
perceived, tliat if we had kept on board all our lives had 
been saved. These thoughts, and my solitude, drew tears 
from my eyes, though all in vain. So resolving to get to 
the ship, I stripped and leapt into the water j when swim- 
ming round her, I was afraid I should not get any thing to 
lay bold of ; but it was niy good fortune to espy a small 
piece of rope hang down by the fore-chains, so low that by 
the help of it, though with great didiciilty, 1 got inta the

foreciMi^ of the ship. Here I found ,that the ship was 
bttlgodyilttd had a great deal of water in her hold ; her stern 
WE8 lifted up against a bank, and her head almost to the 
water. All her quarters, and what was there, was free and 
diy. The provisions I found in good order, with which I 
crammed my pockets, and losing no time, eat while 1 was 
doing other things ; 1 also found some rum, of which I took 
a hearty dram; and now I wanted for nothing except a 
boat, which indeed was all, to carry away what was need- 
ful for me. 

Necessity occasions quickness of thought. We had se- 
veral spare yards, a spare topmast or two, and two or three 
large spars of wood. With these I fell to work, and flung 
as many of them overboard as I coul(f manage, tying every 
one of Ihem with a rope, that they might not drive away. 
This done 1 went down to the ship’s side, and tied four of 
them fast together at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying 
two or three short pieces of plank upon them crossways, 1 
found it would bear me,^ but not any considerable weight. 
Upon which I went to work again, cutting a spare topmast 
into three lengths, adding them to my raft w ith a grhtrt deal 
of labour and pains. 1 then considered what I should load 
it with, it being not able to bear a ponderous burden. And 
thb 1 soon thought of, flrst laying upon it all the'pl^nks and 
boards I could get ; next I lowered down threq of the sea- 
men’s chests, after I had filled them with bread, rice, three 
Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat’s flesh, and some 
European corn, what little the rats had spared ) and for 
liquors, 1 found several cases of bottles belonging to our 
skipper, in which were some cordial waters, and four or 
five gallons of rack, which I stowed by themselves. By 
this time the tide beginning to flow, I perceived my coat, 
waistcoat, and shirt swim away, which 1 had left on the 
shore ; as for my linen-breeches and stockings, I swam with 
them to the ship ; but I soon found clothes enough, though 1 
took no more than I wanted for the present. My eyes were 
chiefly on tools to work with ; and, after a long search, I 
found out the carpenter’s chest, which 1 got safe down on 
my raft. 1 then looked for arms and ammunition, and in the 
great cabin found two good fowlingrpieces, two pistols, se- 
veral powder-horns filled, a small bag of shot, and two old 
r^ty svrords. I likewise found three barrels of powder* 
^wo uf yjihich were good, but the third had taken water* 



OF ROBINSON qRUSOE. 29 

also two or three broken oars, two saws, an ax, and a ham* 
roer. I then put td sea, and in getting to shore had three 
encouragements. 1. A smooth calm sea. 2. The tide 
rising and setting in to shore, 3. The little wind there was 
blew towards the land. After I had sailed about a mile, 1 
found the raft to drive a little distance from the place where 
I first landed ; and thon I perceived a little opening of the 
land, with a strong current of the tide running into it : up- 
on which I kept the middle of the stream. But great was 
ray concern, when on a sudden tl)e forepart of my raft ran 
aground, so that had I not, with great difficulty, for near 
half an hour, kept my back straining against the chests to 
keep my effects in their places, all I had would have gone 
into the sea. But after some lime, the rising of the water 
caused the raft to float again, and coming up a Httla river 
with land on both sides, I landed in a little cave, as near the 
mouth as possible, the better to discover a sail, if any suchv 
providentially passed that way. 

Not far off, I espied a hill of stupendous height, sur - 
rounded with lesser hills about it, and thither I was resolved 
to go ajid view the country, that i might see what part 
was best to fix my habitation. Accordingly, arming my- 
self with a pistol, a fowling-piece, powder and ball, I as- 
cended the mountain. There 1 perceived I was in an island, 
encompassed by the sea, no distant lands to be seen but 
scattering rocks that lay to the west : that it seemed to 
be a barren place, and as I thought, inhabited only by wild 
beasts. I perceived abundance of fowls, but ignorant of 
what kind, or whether good for nourishment ; I shot one of 
them at my return, wliich occasioned a confused screaming 
among the other birds, and 1 found it, by its colour and beak, 
to be a kind of hawk, but its flesh was perfet carrion. 

When I came to my raft, I brought my effects on shore^ 
which work spent that day entirely ; and fearing that some 
cruel beasts might devour me in the night time while I slept, I 
made a kind of hut or barricade with the chests and boards 
I had brought on shore. That night I slept very comfort- 
ably ; and the next morning my thoughts were employed to 
make a further attempt on the ship, and bring away ^liat 
necessaries I could find, before another storm should break 
her in pieces. Accordingly 1 got on board as before, and 
prepared a second raft far more nice than the first, upon 
which 1 brought away the carpenter’s stores, two or three 



54 tIFE A^P ADVENTURES 

bags full of nails, a great jack-screw^ a do 2 eii or two of 
hatchets, and a grind-stone. 1 also toofk away several things 
that belonged to the gunner, particularly two or three iron 
crows, twp barrels of musket-bullets, another fowling piece, 
a small qi^antity of powder, and a large bagful of small shot. 
Besides these, I took all the men's clothes I could find, a 
spare fore top-sail, a hammock, and some bedding ; and 
thus completing my second cargo, I made all the haste to 
shore I could, fearing some wild beast might destroy what 
I had there already. But I only found a little wild cat 
sitting on one of the chests, which seeming not to fear me 
or the gun lha t 1 presented at her, 1 threw her a piece of 
biscuit, which she instantly eat and departed. 

When I had got these effects on shore, 1 went to work, in 
order to make me a little tent with the sail and some poles 
which 1 had cut for that purpose ; and having finished it, 
what things might be damaged by the W'eather I brought 
in, piling all the empty chests and casks in a circle, the 
better to fortify it against any sudden attempt of man or 
beast. After this I blocked up the doors with some boards, 
and an empty chest, turned the long way oujt. 1 then 
charged my gun and pistol, and laying my beS on the 
ground, slept as comfortably, till next morning, as though 1 
had been in a Christian country. 

Now, though I had enough to subsist me a long time, yet 
despairing of a sudden deliverance, or that both ammunition 
and provision might be spent before such thing happened, I 
coveted as much as I could ; and so long as the ship re- 
mained in that condition, I daily brought away one neces- 
sary or other ; particularly the rigging, sails, and cordage, 
some twine, a barrel of wet powder, some sugar, a barrel 
of meal, three casks of rum, and, what indeed was most 
welcome to me, a whole hogshead of bread. 

The next time I went I cut the cables in pieces, carried 
off a hawser whole, with a great deal of iron-work, and 
made another raft with the mizen and sprit-sail yard ; but 
this being so unwieldy, by the too heavy burden 1 had upon 
it, and hot being able so dexterously to guide it as the for- 
mer, both my cargo and I were overturned. For ray part, 
all the damage I sustained was a wet skin $ and, at low wa- 
ter, after much labour in diving, I got most of the cables, 
and some pieces of iron. 

Thirteen days I had now been in the island, and elevec

times on board, bringing away all that was possible ; and I 
believe had the weather been calm, I should Have brought 
away the whole ship piece by piece. As 1 was going the 
twelfth time, the wind began to rise ; however 1 ventured 
at low water, and rummaging the cabin, in a locker 1 found 
several razors, scissors, and some dozens of knives, and 
forks ; and in another thirty-six pounds of pieces of eight| 
silver and gold. Ah ! simple vanity,” said I, “ whom 
“ this world so much dotes on, where is now thy virtue, thy 
“excellency to me? You cannot procure me one thing 
“ needful, nor remove me from this desolate island to a 
“ place of plenty. One of these knives, so meanly esteemed, 
“ is to me more preferable than all this heap. E'en, there- 
“ fore, remain where thou art, to sink in the deep as unre- 
“ garded, even as a creature whose life is not worth pre- 
“ serving.” Yet, after all this exclamation, I wrapt it up in a 
piece of canvas, and began to think of making another raft : 
but 1 soon perceived the \\ind began to rise, a fresh gale 
blowing from the shore, and the sky overcast with clouds 
and darkness ; so thinking a raft to be in vain, I let myself 
into the jvater, w ilh what things I had about me, and it was 
with much difficulty I got ashore, when soon after, it blew 
a fearful storm. 

That night I slept very contentedly in my little tent, sur- 
rounded vvitli all my effects j but when I looked out in the 
morning, no more ship was to be seen. This much sur- 
prised nje for the present ; yet, when I considered I had lost 
no time, abated no pains, and had got every thing useful 
out of her, I comforted my.-elf in the best manner, and 
entirely submitted to the will of Providence. 

My next ihoughls were, how I should defend and secure 
in\self from savages and wild beasts, if any such were in 
the island. At one lime I thought of digging a cave ; at 
another 1 was for erecting a tent ; and, at length I resolved 
lo ilo both ; The manner or form of which w ill not, 1 hope, 
he unpleasing to describe. 

Wiieii 1 considered the ground where I was, that it was 
moorish, and had no fresh water near it, my resolutions 
were to search for a soil healthy and well watered, where 1 
might not only be sheltered from the sun’s scorching heat, 
but be more conveniently situated, as well to be secured 
from wild men and beasts of prey, as more easily to discover 
any distant saii^ should it ever so happen.

And, indeed, it was not long before f had my desire. I 
found a little plain near a rising hill, the front towards 
which being as steep as a house-side, nothing could descend 
on me firom the top. On the side of this rock was a little 
hollow place, resembling the entrance or door of a cave. 
Just before this place, on the circle of the green, I resolved 
my tent should stand. This plain did not much exceed 
a hundred yeards broad, and about twice as long, like a de- 
lightful green before my door, with a’ pleasing though an 
irregular descent every way to the low grounds by the sea- 
side, lying on the N. W. side of the hill ; so that it was 
sheltered from the excessive heat of the sun. After this, I 
drew a semi-circle, containing ten yards in a semi-diameter 
and l;,wenty yards in the whole, driving down two rows of 
strong stakes, not six inches from each other. Then with a 
piece of cable which I had cut on board, I regularly laid 
them in a circle between the piles up to their tops, which 
were more than five feet out of the earth, and after drove 
another row of piles looking within side against them, be- 
tween two dr three feet high, which made me conclude it a 
little impregnable castle against men and beasts. And for 
my better security I would have no door, but entered in and 
came put by the help of a ladder, which 1 also made. 

Here was my fence and fortress, into which I carried all 
my riches, ammunition and stores. After which, working 
on the rock, what with dirt and stones I dug out, I not 
only raised my ground two feet, but made a little celler to 
my mansion-house ; and this cost me many days labour and 
pains. One day, in particular, a shower of raiii falling, 
thunder and lightning ensued, which put me in terror lest 
my powder should take fire, and not only hinder my ne- 
cessary subsistence, by killing me food, but even blow up 
me and my habitation. To prevent which, 1 fell to making 
boxes and bags, in order to separate it, having by me near 
1501b. weight. And thus being established as king of the 
island, every day I went out with my gun to see what I 
could kill that was fit lo eat. I soon perceived numbers of 
goats, but very shy ; yet having watched them narrowly, 
and seeing 1 could better shoot off the rocks than when la 
the low' grounds, I happened to shoot a she-goat suckling a 
young kid ; wi)i(»h not thinking its dam slain, stood by

kid over the pales, arfd would willingly have kepf it alive; 
but finding it could not be brought to eat, I was forced to 
slay it also for my subsistence. 

Thus entering into as strange a scene of life as ever any 
man was in, I had most melancholy apprehensions concern- 
ing my deplorable condition : and many times the tears 
would plentifully run down my face, when I considered 
how I was debarred from all communication with human 
kind. Yet while these desponding cogitations would seem 
to make me accuse Providence, other good thoughts would 
interpose and reprove me after this manner : Well, suppos- 
ing you are desolate, is it not better to be so than totally 
perish? Why were you singled out to be saved, and the rest 
destroyed ? Why sliould you complain, when not only your 
life is preserved, but the ship driven even into your reach, in 
order to take what was necessary out of her for your sub- 
sistence ? But to proceed. It was by the account I kept, 
the 30th of September, when I firs^t landed on this island. 
About twelve days after, fearing lest I should lose my 
reckoning of time, nay, even forget the Sabbath days, for 
want of pen, ink, and paper, I carved with a knife upon a 
large post, in great letters, and set it up in the similitude of 
a cross on the sea-shore where I landed, I came on shores 
Sept, 30, 1059. Every day 1 cut a notch with my knife on 
the sides of this square post, and that on the Sabbath was as 
long again as the rest ; and every first day of the month aa 
long again as that long one. In this manner I kept my ca- 
lendar, weekly, monthly, or yearly reckoning of time. But 
had I made a more strict search (as afterwards I did) I 
needed not have set up this mark j for among the parcels 
belonging to the gunner, carpenter, and captain's mate, I 
found those very things I wanted ; particularly pens, ink 
and paper ; also I found two or three compasses, some ma- 
thematical instruments, dials, perspective glasses, books of 
navigation, three English Bibles, and several other good 
bool^, which I carefully put up. — Here I cannot but c^ll to 
mind our having a dog and two cats on board, whom I 
made inhabitants with me in my castle. Though •one might 
think I had all the necessaries that were desirable yet still 
I found several things waiituig. My ink was daily wasting; 
I wanted needles, pins, and thread, to mend or keep my 
clothes together ; and particularly a spade, pickaxe, or 
fihovfl, to remove the earth. It was a year before I iinisbed

guns securely hanging against the side of the rock. This 
made it a very pleasant sight to mg, as being the result of 
vast labour and diligxuice ; which leaving for a while, and 
me to the enjoyment of it, I shall give the reader an account 
of my Journal from the day of my landing, till the fixing 
and settling of my habitation, as heretofore shown. 

JOURNAL. 

September 30th, 1G59, I unhapj>y Robinson Crusoe, 
having suffered shipwreck, was driven on this desolate 
Island, which 1 named the Desolate Island of Despair, my 
companrons being swallow'ed up in the tempestuous ocean*. 
The next day 1 spent in consideration of my unhappy cir- 
cumstances, having no prospect but of death, either to be 
starved with hunger, or dev oured with beasts or merciless 
savages. 

Oct. 1. That morning with great comfort I beheld the 
ship drove ashore. Some hopes 1 had, that when the storm 
was abated, 1 might he able to get some food and neces- 
saries out of her, which I conceived were not damaged, be- 
cause the ship (lid stand upright. At this time I lamented 
the loss of my companions, and onr misfortune in leaving 
the vessel. When I pereei\ed the ship, as it were, lie dry, 
1 waded through the sands, then swam aboard, the weather 
being very rainy, with scarcely any wind. 

To the 14th of this month, iny time w^as employed in 
making voyages every tide, getting what I could out of the 
ship. The weather very wet and uncertain. 

Oct. 20. My raft and all the goods thereop were over- 
set ; yet 1 recoverexl most again at low water 

Oct. 25. It blew liar(f,,aud rained night and da^’, when 
the ship went in pieces, so that nothing was seen of her but 
the wreck at low water. This day I secured my goods frori 
the inclemency of the weather.

LIFE AND ADVfiNTDRES 


But now a very strange event happened. For being in 
the height of my search, what should come into my hand^ 
but a bag, which used to hold corn (as I supposed) for the 
fowls ; jso immediately resolving to put gunpowder in it, I 
shook all the husks and dirt upon one side of the rock, little 
expecting what the conseqiK iice would be. The rain had 
fallen plentifully a few days before ; and about a month 
after, to my great amazement something began to look out 
very green and flourishing ; and when I came to view it 
more nicely every day as it grew, I found about ten or 
twelve ears of green barley appearing in the very same shape 
and make as that in England. 

I can scarce express the agitations of my mind at this 
sight. Hitherto, 1 had looked upon the aclions of this life 
no otherwise than only as the events of )>lind chance and 
fortune. But now the appearance of this barley, flourishing 
in a barren soil, and my ignorance in not conceiving how it 
should come there, made me concbule, that miracles were 
not yet ceased : nay I even tliouglit that God had appointed 
it to grow there without any seed, purely for my sustenance 
in this miserable and desolate island. And indeed such 
great effect this had upon me, that it often made me melt 
into tears, through a grateful sense of God’s mercies; and 
the greater still was my thankfulness, when I perceived 
about this little, field of barley sonic rice stalks also, wonder- 
fully flourishing. 

While thus pleased in mind, I concluded there must be 
more corn in the island ; and therefore made a diligent 
search narrowly among the rocks; but not being able to 
find any, on a sudden it came into my mind, how I had shaken 
the husks of corn out of the bag, and iheii my admiration 
ceased, with my gratitude to the Divine Being, as thinking 
it was but natural^ and not to be conceived a miracle; though 
even the manner of its preservation might have made me 
own it was a wonderful event of God’s kind Providence. 

It was about the latter end of June when the ears of 
this Corn ripened, which I laid up very carefully, together 
with 20 or 30 stalks of rice, expecting one day 1 shoiiUi reap 
the fruit of my labour ; yet four years were expired before 
I could allow myself to eat any barley bread, and much 
longer time before I had any rice.* After this, with indefa- 
tigable pains and industry, for three or four mouths, at last 
1 tinished my wall on the 14tli of April, having no way to 
go into it, but by a ladder against the wall. 



OF ftOBlNSON Ct^VSOk. 


id 

April 17. I finiglied my ladder and ascended it; after- 
wards pulled it up, then let it down on the other side, and 
descended into my new habitation, where I had space enough 
and so fortified, that nothing could attack me without scal- 
ing the walls. 

But what does all human pains and industry avail, if the 
blessing of Ciod does not crown our labours ? Or who can 
stand before the Almighty, when he stretchetli forth his arm? 
For one time as I wars at the entrance of my cave, there hap- 
pened such a dreadful eartlupiake, that not only the roof of 
the cave came tumbling about my ears, but the posts seem- 
ed to crack terribly at the same time. This put me in great 
amazement ; and running to the ladder, and getting over the 
wall, I then plainly knew it was an earthquake ; the place I 
stood on sustained three terrible shocks in less than three 
minutes. But judge of rny terror when I saw the top of a 
great rock roll into the sea! 1 then expected the island would 
be swallowed up every moment : And what made the scene 
still more dreadful, was to see the sea thrown in the most 
violent agitation and disorder by this tremendous accident. 

For ijiy ])art 1 stood like a ciiminal at the place of execu- 
tion, ready to expire. At the moving of the earth, I was, 
as it were, sea-sick ; and very much afraid lest the rock, 
under which was my defence and habitation, should over- 
whelm it and myself iu a lasting tomb. 

When the third dreadful shock bad s})eiit itself, my spirits 
began to revive : yet still I would iKit venlure to ascend 
the ladder, but coiilinued sitting, not knowing w hat 1 should 
do. So little grace had 1 then, as only to say, Lord have 
mercy upon me ! and no sooner was the eartbtpiake over, but 
that pathetic praver left rne. 

It was not long after, when a horrible tempest arose, at 
the same lime atter.ded with a hurricane of wind. The sea 
seemed mountains high, and the wave.s rolled so impetuously, 
that nothing could be perceived but froth and foam. Three 
hours (lid tliis storm continue, and in so violent a manner, as 
to tear the very trees up by the roots, which was succeeded 
by abundance of raiii. When the tempest was over, 1 vent 
to my tent : but the rain coming on in a furious manner, 1 
was obliged to take shelter in the cave, where I was forced 
to cut a channel through iiiy fortification to let the water out. 
It continued raining all that night, and some time the next 
day. These accidents made me resolve, as'^soon as the

weather cleared up, to build me a littje hut in some open 
place, walled round to defend me from wild creatures and 
savages ; not doubting but at the next earthquake, the 
mountain would fall upon my habitation and me, and swal- 
low up all in its bowels. 

April IG— 20. These days I spent in contriving how 
and in what manner I should fix my place of abode. All 
this while I was under the most dreadful apprehensions. — 
When 1 looked round my habitation, every thing I found in 
its proper place. I had several resolutions whether 1 should 
move or not 3 but at length resolved to stay where I was tijH 
I found out a convenient place where I might pitch my tent. 

April 22. When I began to put my resolutions in prac- 
tice, I was stopt for want of tools and instruments to work 
with. Most of my axes and hatchets were useless, occa- 
sioned by cutting the hard timber that grew on the island. 
It took me up a full week to make my grindstone of use to 
me ; and at last I found out a way to turn it about with ray 
foot, by help of a -wheel and a string. 

April 28, 29. These days were spent in grinding my tools. 

April 30. My bread falling short, I allowed myself but 
one biscuit a day. 

May 1, As I walked along the sea-shore, 1 found a barrel 
of gun-powder, and several pieces of the wTeck, the sea had 
fiung up. Having secured these, I made to the ship, whose 
stem was tore otf, and washed a great distance ashore ; but 
the rest lay in the sands. This 1 supposed was occasioned 
by the earthquake. I now resolved to keep my old place 
of abode 3 and also to go to the ship that day, but then 
found it impossible. 

May 3. This day I went on board, and with my saw 
sawed off one of *the beams, which kept the quarter-deck. 
I then cleared the sand till fiood. 

May 4, 1 caught some fish, but they were not whole- 

some. The same day I also catched a young dolphin. 

May 5. This day I also repaired to the wreck, and sawed 
another piece of timber, and when the flood came, 1 made 
a float of three great planks, which were driven ashore by 
the tide. 

May (i — 9. These days 1 brought off the iron bolts, 
opened the deck with the iron crow, and carried two planks 
’ to land, having made a way into the very middle of the 
. wreck, 



OF ROBINSON. CRUSOE. 35 

May 10 — 14. this time I spent in bringing off gt^at 

quantities of iron and timber. 

May 15. Took with me two hatchets on purpose to cut 
off some lead from the roll, but all in vain ; for it lay too 
low under water. 

May 16. I omitted going to the wreck this day j for em- 
ploying myself to look for pigeons, 1 outstayed my time. 

May 17. I perceived several pieces of the wreck driven 
ashore, which I found belonged to the head of the ship. 

May 24. To this day I worked on the wreck, and i^ith 
great difficulty loosened some things so much with the crow, 
that at the first flowing tide, several casks floated out, and 
many of the seamen’s chests 5 yet that day nothing came to 
land but pieces of timber, and a hogshead which had some 
Brazil pork in it. I continued working to the 15lh of June ; 
(except necessary time for food or rest ;) and, had I known 
how to have built a boat, I had timber and planks enough : 
I had also near 100 weight of sheet lead. 

June 16. As I was wandering towards the sea-side,^! 
found a large tortoise or turtle, being the first I had seen on 
the island j though, as I afterwards found, there were many 
on the other side of it. 

June 17 . This day I spent in cooking it, found in her 
threescore eggs, and her flesh the most savoury and {Peasant 
1 ever tasted in my life. 

June 18. I staid within this day, there being a continual 
rain, and it was somewhat more chilly and cold than usual. 

June 19. Exceedingly bad, being taken with a trembling 
and shivering. 

June 20. Awake all night, ray head racked with pain, 
and feverish. 

June 21. Sick unto death, and terrified with the dismal 
apprehensions of my condition. Prayed to God more fre- 
quently, but very confusedly. 

June 22. Something better, but still uneasy in my mind. 

June 23. Again relapsed much as before. 

Junt 24. Mended a second time. . 

June 25. A violent ague for seven hours, cold hot 
fits, succeeded with faint sweats. 

June 26. Better but very weak, yet I scrambled out, shot 
a she-goat, brought it home and boiled some 01 it ; I would 
willingly have stewed it, and made some broth, but hact no 
pot. 



36 LIFE ANp ADVENTURES 

"June 27. All this day I was afflicted with an ague ; 
thirsty, yet could not help myself to water: Prayed to God 
in these words : “ Lord in pity look upon me : Lord liave 
“ mercy upon me : have mercy upon me !” After tins 1 
fell asleep, which I found had much refreshed me, when I 
awaked. I fell fast asleep a second time, and fell into this 
strange and terrible sort of a dream. 

Methought I was sitting on the same spot of ground at the 
outside of the wall where I sat when the storm blew after 
the earthquake ; and that I saw a man descending from a 
great black cloud, and alight upon the ground. He was ail 
over as bright as a flash of fire that a little before surrounded 
him ; his countenance inconceivably terrible ; the earth, as 
it were, trembled when he stept upon the ground, and flashes 
of fire seemed to fill all the air. No sooner 1 thought he 
landed upon tlie earth, but with a long spear or other wea- 
pon, he made towards me ; but first ascending a rising 
ground, his voice added to my amazement, wlien 1 thought 
1 heard him pronounce these dreadful words, ‘‘ Unhappy 
“ wretch I seeing all these things have not brouglit thee to 

repentance, thou shall immediately die.” In pionquncing 
this dreadful sentence, I thought he meant to kill me with 
the spear that was in his hand. 

Any body may think it impossible for me to express the 
horrors of my mind at this vision : and even when 1 awaked, 
this very dream made a deep impression upon my mind. — 
The little divine knowledge I had, 1 received from my fa- 
ther’s instructions, and that was worn o^it b} an unintei- 
rupted series of sea-fearing impiety for eight years space. 
Except what sickness forced from me, I do not remember I 
had one thought of lifting up my heart towai'ds God, but ra- 
ther had a certain stupidity of soul, not having the least sense 
or fear of the Omnipotent Being when in distress, nor of gra- 
titude to him for his deli\eiaiices. Nay, when 1 was on the 
desperate expedition on the desert African shore, 1 cannot 
remember I had one thought of what would become of me, 
or to beg his consolation and assistance in my suft'erings and 
distress. When the Portuguese captain took me up, aud 
honourably used me, nay, farther, when I was even delivered! 
from being drowned, b\ escaping to this island, I never look- 
ed upon it as a judgment, but only#said I \vas an unfortunate 
dog, and that’s all. Indeed, some secret transports of soul I 
had, which was not through grace, but only a common flight 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 37 

of joy, that I was yet alive, when my companions were all 
drowned, and no dtlier joy could I conceive but w^hat is 
common with the sailors over a bowl of punch, after they 
have escaped the greatest dangers. 

The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor conveni- 
ences, might have called upon n)e for a thankful acknow- 
ledgment to Providence. Indeed the growth of my corn 
touched me wdth some sense ; but that soon wore off again. 
The terrible earthquake pointed to me, as it w'ere, the fin- 
ger of God, but my dreadful amazement continued no longer 
than its duration. But now wdien my spirits began to sink 
under the burden of a strong distemper, and I could leisurely 
view the miseries of death present themselves before my 
eyes, llien my awakened conscience began to reproach me 
with my past life, in which I so wickedly provoked the 
justice of God to pour down his vengeance upon me. 

Such reflections as these oppressed me even in the violence 
of distemper. Some prayers 1 uttered, which only proceeded 
from the fear of death. But when I considered my father’s 
advice and prophecy, I could not forbear weeping : for he 
told me, ‘‘ That if I did persist in my folly, 1 should not only 
“ be deprived of God’s blessing, but have time enough to 
“ I’efiect upon my despising his instructions, and this in a 
“ wretched lime, when none could help me.” And now 
concluding it to be fulliiled, having no soul in the island to 
administer any comfort to me, I prayed earnestly to the 
Lord, that he would kelp me in this my great calamity, — 
And this I think, was the first time I prayed in sincerity for 
many >ear.s. But now I must return to njy journal, 

June -28. Something refreshed wilh s^etq^ and the fit 
quite off, I got up. My dream still occasioned in me agreal 
consternation ; and fearing that the ague might return the 
succeeding day, I concluded it time to get something to o«mr- 
fort me, 1 filled a case- bottle witJi water, and set it vvitlun 
reach of my bed ; and to make it more nourishing and less 
chilly, I put some rum in it. The next thing 1 did was to 
broil me a piece of goat’s flesh, of which I eat but little ; I 
was very w'eak ; however, walked about, dreading the return 
of my distemper; and at night I supped on lliree of the 
turtle’s eggs, wl^ich 1 rousted and eat, begging God’s bless- 
ing therewith. 

After I had eaten, I attempted to walk again out of doors 
with my gun } but was so weak, that 1 sat down, and look-

ed at the sea, which was smooth and c^lni. While I con- 
tinued here, these thoughts came into my mind. 

In what manner is the production of the earth and sea, of 
which I have seen so much? From whence came myself, 
and all other creatures living, and of what are they made ? 

Our beings were assuredly created by some almighty in- 
visible Power, who framed the earth, the sea, the air, and 
all therein. But what is that Power? 

Certainly it must follow that God has created it all. Yet, 
said I, if God has made all this, he must be the Ruler of 
them all, and what is relating thereto ; for certainly the 
Power that makes must indisputably have a power to guide 
and direct them. And if this be so, (as certainly it must,) 
nothing can happen without his knowledge and appoint- 
ment. Then surely, if nothing happens without God’s ap- 
pointment, certainly God has appointed these my sufferings 
to befall me. And here I fixed my firm belief that it was 
his will that it should be so ; and then proceeded to enquire, 
why should God deal with me in this manner ? Or what 
had I done thus do deserve his indignation ? 

, Here conscience flew in my face, reprehending pie as a 
blasphemer j crying with a loud and piercing voice, ** Un- 
** worthy wretch ! how dare you ask what you have done ? 
“ Look on your past life and see w hat you have left undone ! 
“ Ask thyself, why thou wert not long ago in the merciless 
“ hands of death? Why not drowned in Yarmouth roads, 
“ or killed in the fight, when the ship was taken by the 
“ Salee man of war ? Why not entombed in the bowels of 
“ wild beasts on the African coast, or drowned here when 
“ all thy companions suffered ship^vreck in the ocean?” 

Struck dumb with these reflections, I rose up in a pen- 
sive manner, being so thoughtful that 1 could not go to 
sleep ; and fearing the dreadful return of my distemper, it 
caused me to remember, that the Brazillians use tobacco for 
almost all diseases. I tlien went to nty chest in order to 
find sqme, where Heaven, no doubt, directed me to find a 
cure for both soul and body ; for there I found one of the 
Bibles, which, till this time, 1 Itad neither leisure nor incli- 
nation to look into. I took both the tobacco and that out 
of the chest, and laid them on the table. Several experi- 
ments did 1 try with the tobacco < First, I took a piece of 
leaf, and chewed it j but it being very green and strong, al- 
most stupified me. Ne.xt 1 steeped it in some rum an hour 



OF ROBINSON C^USOl. 39 

or two, resolving when I went to bed to take a dose of it; 
and, in the third place, I burnt some over a pan of fire, 
holding my nose over it as long as I could endure it with- 
out suffocalioij. 

In the intervals of this operation, though iriy head was 
giddy and disturbed by the tobacco, I took up the Bible to 
read. No sooner did I open it, but there appeared to rac 
these words, Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will 

deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.” 

At first, this sentence made a very deep impression on 
ray heart, but it soon wore off again, when I considered the 
word deliver was foreign to me. And as the children of 
Israel said, when they were promised flesh to eat, “ Can 
‘‘ God spread a table in the wilderness V In like manner I 
began to say, Can God himself deliver me from this deso- 
“ late island However, the words would still return to my 
mind, and afterwards made a greater impression upon me. 

As it was now very late, and the tobacco had dozed my 
head, I was inclined to sleeps but before I would lie down 
1 fell on my knees, and implored the promise that God had 
made me in the Holy Scripture, that if I called upon him 
“ in the day of trouble, he would deliver me,^’ With much 
difficulty, I afterwards drank the rum, w herein I had steeped 
the tobacep, which flying into my head, threw me into such 
a profound sleep, that it was three o’clock the next day be- 
fore I awoke ; or rather I believe, I slept two days, having 
certainly lost a day in my account, and I could never tell 
any other way. When I got up, my spirits were lively and 
cheerful ; my stomach much better, being very hungry j 
and, in short, no fit returned the next day, which was the 
29th, but I found mysdf much altered for the better. 

The 30th I went abroad with my gun, but not far, and 
killed a sea-fowl or two, resembling a brand goose, which, 
however, I cared not to eat wlien I brought them home, 
but dined on two more of the turtle’s eggs. In the evening 
I renewed my medicine, excepting that I did not take so 
large a quantity, neither did I chew the leaf, or hold my 
bead over the smoak : but the next day, which was the first 
of July, having a little return of the cold fit, I again took 
my medicine as I did the first time. 

July 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak. In thi« 
condition, I often thought of these words, “ I will deliver 
thee and while, at some times, 1 would think of the im- 



40 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

possibility of it» other thoughts would reprehend me for dis- 
regarding the deliverances I had received even from the 
most forlorn and distressed condition, I asked myself, what 
regard have I had lo God for his abundant mercies ^ Have 
I done my part ? “ He has delivered me, but 1 have not 

glorified him — as if I had said, 1 had not owned and been 
thankful for these as delixerances, and how could I expect 
greater? So much did tliis sensibly touch my heart, that 1 
gave God thanks for my recovery from sickness in the most 
humble prostration. 

July 4. This morning 1 began seriously bx ponder on wliat 
is written in the New Testanjent, resolving to read a chap- 
ter every morning and night as long as my thoughts would 
engage me. As soon as I set about this work seriously, 1 
found my heart deeply affected with the im))iety of my past 
life ; these Words that 1 thought were spoken to me in my 
dream, revived, “All these things have not brought thee to 
“ to repentance.” After this, 1 begged of God to assist me 
with his Holy Spirit in returning to my duty. One day, in 
perusing tiie Scriptures, 1 came to these words, “ Him hath 
“ God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repeiit- 
“ ance, and to give remission c’' immediately 1 laid down Uie 
book, and with uplifted hands to Heaven, loudly cried, “ () 
blessed Jesus, thou Son of David, Jesus thou exalted Prince 
and Saviour, give me repentance !” And now index'd I pray- 
ed with a true sense of my coneiition, and a more certain hope 
fouiidetl on the word of God. Now I had a different sense 
of these words, “ Call on me and I will deliver thee,” that 
is, from the dreadful load of guilt which oppressed my sin- 
ful soul, and not from a solitary life, w hich might rather be 
called a blessing, seeing 1 neither wanted for food nor rai- 
ment, when compared with living among the human r,ace, 
surrounded with so much oppression, misery, and affliction : 
In a word, 1 came to this conclusion, that a deliveranee 
from sill was a much greater blessing than a deliverance 
from a^iction. But again 1 proct ed to my journal. 

To ttie 14th of July, I walked about w ith my gun, little 
and link at a time, hav'ing been reduced to the greatest 
extremity of w eakness. The applications and experiments 
I used, were perfectly new : ueitlier could 1 recommend 
them to any one’s practice, though it carried off the 

tit, it very much weakened me, and I had frequent convul- 
sions in my nerves and limbs for some time. From this, I

vearned that going abroad in rainy weather, especially when 
it was attended with storms and hurricanes of wind, was 
most pernicious to health. I had now been about ten 
months in the island ; and, as I never had seen any of the 
human kind, I therefore accounted myself as sole monarch ; 
and as I grew better, having secured my habitation to my 
mind, I resolN^ed to tnake a tour round my kingdom, in or- 
der to make new discoveries. 

The 15th of July,* I began my journey; I first went to 
the creek, where I had brought my rafts on shore ; and tra- 
velling farther, found that the tide went no higher than two 
miles up, where there was a little brook of running water, 
on the banks of which were many pleasant savannahs or 
meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass. On the 
rising parts, where I supposed the water did not re^ch, I 
perceived a great deal of tobacco growing to a very strong 
stalk. Several other plants I likewise found, the virtues of 
which I did not understand. I searched a long time for the 
Cavassa root, which I knew the Indians in that climate 
made their bread of, but all in vain. Tliere were several 
plants of aloes, though at that time I knew not what they 
were 3 likewise I saw' several sugar canes, but imperfect for 
want of cultivation. Willi these few discoveries, I came 
back that night and slept contentedly in my little castle. 

The next day, being the Ifith, going the same way, but 
farther than the day before, I found the country more adorn- 
ed with woods and trees. Here I perceived different fruits 
in great abundance. Melons in plenty lay on the ground, and 
clusters of grapes, ripe and very rich, spread over the trees. 
You may imagine I was glad of the discovery, yet eat very 
sparingly, lest I should throw myself into a flux or fever. 
The grapes I found of excellent use ; for when I had dried 
them in the sun, which preserved them as dried raisins are 
kept, they proved very wholesome and nourishing, and 
served me in those seasons when no grapes were to be had. 

The night drawing on apace, I ascended up a tree, and 
slept very comfortably, though it was the first time 1 had 
lain out of my habitation. And wlicn the morning came, I 
proceeded with great pleasure on my way, travelling about 
four miles, as 1 imagined, by the length of the valley, di- 
recting my course norlhwawi, there being a ridge of hills on 
the south and north side of me. At the end of the valley, 
I came to an opening, where the country seemed to descend 



4S LIFE A'ND ADVENTURES 

to the west: there I found a little spring of fresh water, 
proceeding out of the side of the hill, with its crystal streams 
running directly east. And indeed, here my senses were 
charmed with the most beautiful landscape nature could af- 
ford ; for the country appeared flourishing, green, and de- 
lightful ; that to me it seemed like a planted garden. I then 
descended on the side of that delicious vale, when I found 
abundance of cocoa, orange, lemon, and citron trees, but 
very wild and barren at that time. As for the limes, they 
were delightful and wholesome, the juice of which 1 aftei- 
wards used to mix in water, which made it very cooling and 
refreshing. And now 1 was resolved to carry home and lay 
up a store of grapes, limes, and lemons, against the approach- 
ing wet season. So laying them up in several parcels, and 
then taking a few of each with me, I returned to my little 
castle, after having spent three days in this journey. Before 
I got home, the grapes were so bruised that they were 
utterly spoiled ; the limes, indeed, were good ; but of those 
I could only bring a few. 

July 19. Having prepared two bags I returned thither 
again]^ but, to my great surprise, found all the grapes spread 
about, trod to pieces, and abundance eaten, which made me 
conclude there were wild beasts thereabouts. To prevent 
tbb happening again, I gathered a large quantity of the 
grapes, and hung them upon the out-branches of the tree, 
both to keep them unhurt, and that they might cure and dry 
in the sun : and having well loaded myself with limes and 
lemotis, I returned once more to my old place of resi- 
dence. 

And now contemplating on the fruitfulness of this valley, 
and pleasantness of its situation, its security from storms, 
and the delightfulness of the adjacent woods, I concluded 
1 was settled in the worst part of the country, and there- 
fore was thinking to remove my habitation. 

But when 1 considered again, that, though it was pleasant. 
It was off from the sea-side, where there was a possibility, 
some time or other, a ship might either be driven or sail by ; 
and, that to inclose myself among hills and woods, must cer- 
tainly put an end to my hopes of deliverance ; I resolved 
to let my castle remain where Providence had first assigned 
it. Yet so ravished was I with this place, that 1 made me 
a little kind of bower, surrounding it with a double hedge, 
as high as I could reach, well staked and filled with bul- 



OF ROBINSON C1ROSOB. 


rushes : and having spent a great part of the month of July 
1 think it was the first of August before 1 began to enjoy 
my labour. 

Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry, I took them froOi 
the trees, and they proved excellent good raisins of the snn : 
the most of which I carried to my cave ; and happy for me 
I did so ; by which 1 saved the best part of my winter food. 

Aug. 14. This day it began to rain j and though 1 had 
made me a tent like tlie other, yet having no shelter of a bill 
to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me to retreit 
to, I was obliged to return to my old castle. The rain con- 
tinued more or less every day, till the middle of October ; 
and sometimes so violent, that I could not stir out of my 
cave for several days. This season I found my family to 
increase ; for one of my cats that ran away from me, and 
which I thought had bee« dead, returned about August, 
with three kittens at her heels, like herself, which 1 thought 
strange, because both my cats w'ere females, and the wild 
cats of the island seemed to be of a different kind from our 
European cats ; hut from these cats prodeeded such num- 
bers, that 1 was force<l to kill and destroy them as 1 would 
do wild beasts and vermine. 

To the 2()th of this month, I could not stir out, it raining 
incessantly : when beginning to want food I was compelled 
to venture twice ; the first of which I shot a goat, and af- 
terwards found a very large tortoise. The manner of my 
regulating my food was thus : a bunch of raisins served me 
for my breakfast, a piece of goat’s flesh, or turtle, boiled,, 
for my dinner, and two or three turtle’s eggs for my supper. 
While the rain lasted, I daily worked two or three hpurs at 
enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards 
one side, till 1 came to the outside of the hill, and made a 
door or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall, and 
so I came in and out this way. But after I had done this, 1 
was troubled to see myself thus exposed ; thopgh I could 
not perceive any thing to fear, a goat being the biggest 
creature I had seen upon the island. 

Sept. 30. Casting up the notches on my post, which 
amounted to 3G5, I concluded this to be the anniveirsaiy of 
my landing j and, therefore, humbly prostrating myseir oil 
the ground, confessing myosins, acknowledging God’s righ- 
teous judgments upon me, and praying to Jesus Christ to 
have mercy upon me, I fasted for twelve hours till the going

down of the sun ; and then eating a biscuit and a bunch of 
grapes, laid me on the bed, and with great comfort took my 
night’s repose. Till this time, I never had distinguished 
the Sabbath-day ; but now I made a longer notch than or- 
dinary for the days of rest, and divided the week as well as 
I could, though I found I had lost a day or two in my ac- 
count. My ink failing soon after, I omitted in my daily 
memorandum things of an indifferent nature, and contented 
myself to right down only the most remarkable events of my 
life. The rainy and dry seasons appeared now regular to 
me, and experience taught me how to provide for them : yet, 
in one thing I am going to relate, my experience very much 
failed me. You may call to mind what I have mentioned 
of some barley and rice which I had saved, about thirty 
stalks of the former, and twenty of the latter j and, at that 
time, the sun being in its southern position, going from me, 
together with the rains, made me conclude it a very proper 
season to sow it. Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground 
with Any wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, sow- 
ed about two-thirds of my seed, preserving by me about a 
handful of each. And happy it was I did so ; for’no rains 
falling, it was choaked up, and never appeared above the 
earth till the wet season came again ; and then part of it 
grew as if it had been newly sown. 

I was resolved still to make anolher trial ; and seeking 
for a moister piece of ground near my bower, I there sowed 
the rest of my seed in February, a little before the vernal 
equinox 5 which having the rainy months of March and 
April to water it, yielded a noble crop, and sprang up very 
pleasantly. I had still saved part of the seed, not daring to 
venture all ; and by the time 1 found out the proper seasons 
to sow it in, and that I might expect every year two seed- 
times and two harvests, my stock amounted to above half a 
peck of each sort of grain. 

No sooner were the rains over, but the stakes which I had 
cut from the trees, shot out like willows, the first year after 
loppiug their heads. I was ignorant of the tree I cut them 
from : but they grew so regularly beautiful, that they made 
a most lively apperance, and so flourished in three years 
time, that I resolved to cut more of them ; and these soon 
growing, made a glorious fence, as afterwards I shall observe. 

And now I perceived that the seasons of the year might 
generally be divided not into summer and winter, as in 
Europe, but into wet and dry seasons, as in this manner :

Tlie wet season w ould continue longer or shorter as the 
winds happened to blow. Hut having found the ill conse*, 
quences of being abroad in the rain, 1 took care beforehand 
to furnhjh myself vvith provisions ; and during the wet 
months, sat w ithin doors as much as possible. At this time I 
contrived to make many things that 1 wanted, tliough it cost 
me much labour and pains, before I could accomplish them. 
The first I tried was to make a basket ; but all the twigs I 
could get, proved so brittle, that I could not then perform it. 
It now proved of great advantage to me, that, when a boy, I 
took a great delight at standing at a basket maker’s in the 
same town where iiiy father lived, to view them at work j 
and like other boys, curious to see the manner of their 
•working these things, and very officious to assist, I perfectly 
learned the method of it, and wanted nothing but the tools. 
And, it coming into my mind, that the twigs of that tree of 
which 1 made my stakes, might be as tough as a sallow- 
willow or osiers, growing in England, 1 resolved to make 
an experiment, and went the next day to rny country-seat, 
and found some fit for my torn ; and after cutting down a 
quantity w ith my hatchet, 1 dried them in my pale, and, 
when fit to work with, carried them to my cave, where I 
employed myself in making several sorts of baskets, inso- 
much that I could put in ^'hatsoever 1 pleased. It is true, 
they were not cleverly made, yet they served roy tiirn upon 
all occasions.

LIFE ‘AND ADVENTURES 


But still I wanted two necessary tlrings. I had no cask 
to hold my liquor, except two runlets almost full of rura, a 
few bottles of an ordinary size, and some square case bottles ; 
neither had 1 a pot to boil any thing in, only a large kettle 
un6t to make broth, or stew a bit of meat: I wanted like- 
wise at the beginning of this dry season, a tobacco pipe ; 
but for this I afterwards found an expedient. 

I kept myself employed in planting my second row of 
stakes. But remembering that when 1 travelled up to the 
brook, 1 had a mind to see the whole island, I now resumed 
my intention ; and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two biscuit 
cakes, a great bunch of raisins, with a larger quantity of 
powder and shot than usual, I began my journey. Having 
passed the vale where my bower stood,. I came within view 
of the sea, lying to the west ; when it being a clear day, I 
fairly descried land, extending from the W. to the S. W. 
about ten or fifteen leagues, as I concluded ; but could not 
•ay whether it was an island or a continent. Neither 
coutd I tell what this place might be ; only thought it was 
part of America, and where I might have been in a miser- 
able condition, had I landed. Again, I considered, that if 
this was the Spanish coast, certainly, one time or other, I 
ihould see some ship pass by j and if it was not, then it 
must be the savage coast, between the Spanish country and 
Brazils, which abourjds with cannibals or man-eaters. 

As I proceeded forward, 1 found this side of the island 
much more pleasant than mine ; the fields fragrant, adorned 
with sweet iiowers and verdant grass, together with several 
very fine woods. There were parrots in plenty, which made 
me long for one to be my companion ; but it w as w ith 
great difficulty 1 could knock one down with my stick j and 
1 kept him at home some years before I could get him to 
call me by my name. 

In the iow grounds, I found various sorts of bares and 
foxes, as I took them to be, but much different from those 
in England. Several of these I killed, but never eat them ; 
neither, indeed, had I any occasion ; for abounding with 
goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes, I could defy Leadenhall 
market to furnish me a better table. In this journey, 1 did 
not travel above two miles a day, because I took several 
tucns and windings, to see wlfat discoveries 1 could make, 
returning weary enough to the place where I designed to 
all night, which was either in a tree, or in a place

>\hich I surrounded with stakes, that no wild creature might 
suddenly surprise me. When I came to the sea-shore/ 1 
was amazed to see the splendour of it. Its strand irtS 
covered with shells of the most beautiful tish, and constantly 
abounding with innumerble turtles, and fowls of many 
kinds, w hich 1 was ignorant of, except those called penguins. 
I might have shot as many as 1 pleased, but was sparing of 
my ahimunition, rather choosing to kill a shc-goat, which 1 
did with much difficulty, on account of the flatness of the 
country. 

Now, though this journey produced me the most pleasing 
satisfaction, yet my habitation was so much to my liking, 
that I did not repine at my being sealed on the worst part 
of the island. 1 continued my journey, travelling about 
twelve miles furtlier towards the east, where I set a great 
pile on the shore for a mark, concluding that my next jour- 
ney should bring me to the other side of the island, east from 
my castle, and so round till 1 came to my post again. As 1 
had a constant view of the country, 1 thought 1 could not 
miss my w ay ; but scarcely had 1 travelled three miles, when 
1 descended into a very large valley, so surrounded with 
hills, covered with wood, that I, having no guide but th^ 
sun, nor even that, unless 1 knew well its position at that 
time of the day ; and to add to my misfortune, the weather 
proving very hazy, 1 was obliged to return to my post by 
the sea-side, and so backwards the same way I came. — In 
this journey my dog surprised a kid, and would have killed 
it, had I not prevented him. As I had often been thinking 
of getting a kid or two, and so raising a breed of tame goats 
to supply me after my ammunition was spent, 1 took this 
opportunity of beginning : and having made a collar for 
this little creature, with a string made of rope-yarn, I 
brought it to my bower, and there inclosed and left him ; 
and having spent a month in this journey, at length I return- 
ed to my own habitation. 

Nobody can doubt of my satisfaction, when I returned to 
my little castle, and reposed myself in my hammock. AHef 
my journey, I rested myself a week, which time I employed 
in making a cage for my pretty Poll. I now began to 
consider ray poor kid I had left in the bower, and I imme- 
diately went to fetch it hoilie. When 1 came there, I found 
the young creature almost starved : 1 gave it some food, and 
tied it as before : but there was no occasion, for it followed 



*^48 LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

me like a dog ; and as I constantly fed it, it became so lov^ 
ing, gentle, and fond, that it commenced one of my domes- 
tics, and would never leave me. 

The rainy season of the atumnal equinox being now 
come, 1 kept the 30th of September in the most solemn 
manner, as usual : it being the third year of my abode in 
the island. 1 spent the whole day in acknowledging God's 
mercies, in giving him thanks for making this solitary life as 
agreeable and less sinful, than that of human society ; and 
for the communications of his grace to my soul, in support- 
ing, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his 
Providence, and hope for his eternal presence in the vvorld 
to come. 

Indeed, 1 often did consider how much more happy I was 
in this state of life, than in that accursed manner of living I 
formerly used ; and sometimes when hunting, or viewing 
the country, the anguish of my soul would break out upon 
me, and my very heart would sink within me, to think qf 
the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in j and how I 
was a prisoner locked up within the eternal bars and bolts 
of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without hopes, 
And without redemption. In this condition I would often 
wring my hands and weep like a child : And even some- 
times, in the middle of my work, this fit would take me ; 
and then I would sit down and sigh, looking on the ground 
for an hour or two together, till such lime as my grief got 
vent in a flood of tears. 

One morning as 1 was sadly employed in this manner, 1 
opened my Bible, when I immediately fixed my eyes uppn 
these words, “ 1 will never leave thee, nor forsake thee !" 
Surely, thought I, these words are directed to me, or else why 
should they appear just at a moment when I am bemoaning 
my forlorn condition ; and if God does not forsake, what 
matter is it, since he can make me more happy in this state 
of life, than if*l enjoyed the greatest splendour in the world ? 
But while 1 was going to return God thanks for my present 
state, something seemed to shock my mind, as if it had thus 
said : “ Unworthy wretch, can you pretend to be thankful 
for a condition From which you would pray to be delivered !” 
Here 1 stopt and though 1 could not say, I thanked the 
Divine Majesty for being there, •yet I gave God thanks for 
placing to my view my former course of life, and granting 
me a true knowledge of repentance. And whenever*! open-

ed 0 |f shut the Bible 1 bleesed kind Providence, that directed 
my good friend in England to send it among my goods with* 
out any order, and for assisting me to save it from the power 
of the raging ocean. 

And now beginning my third year, my several daily em- 
ployments were these : First, My duty to Heaven, and di- 
ligently reading the Holy Scriptures 3 which I did twice or 
thrice every day : Secondly, Seeking provisions with my gun, 
which commonly took me up, when it did not rain, three 
hours every morning : Thirdly, The ordering, curing, pre- 
serving and cooking what 1 killed, or catched for my sup- 
ply, which took me up great part of the day ; for, in the 
middle of the day, the sun being in its height, it was so hot, 
that I could not stir out ; so that I had only but four hours 
in the evening to work in : and then the want of tools, of 
assistance, and skill, wasted a great deal of time to little 
purpose. I was no less than two and forty days making a 
board fit for a long shelf, which two sawyers, with their 
tools and saw-pit, would have cut off the same tree in 
half a day. It was of a large tree, as my board was to be 
broad. \ w as three days in cutting it down, and two more 
in lopping otF the boughs, and reducing it to a piece of tim- 
ber. This I hacked and hewed otf each side, till it became 
light to move : and then 1 turned it, made one side of it 
smooth and flat as a board from end to end, then turned it 
downwands, cutting the other side, till I brought the plank 
to be about three inches thick, and smooth on both sides. 
Any body may judge my great labour, and fatigue in such a 
piece of work ; but this 1 went through with patience, as 
also many other things that my circumstances made neces- 
sary for me to do. , 

The harvest months, November and December, were 
now at hand, in which 1 had the pleasing prospect of a very 
good crop. But here 1 met with a new misfortune ; for 
the goats and hares having tasted of the sweetness of the 
blade, kept it so short, that it bad not strength to shoot up 
into a stalk. To prevent this, I enclosed it with a hedge, 
and by day shot some of its devourers ; and my dog which I 
had tied to the field gate, keeping barking all night, so 
frightened those creatures, that 1 got entirely rid of them. 

But no sooner did 1 get rid of these, thah other enemies 
appeared, to wit, whole flocks of several sorts of birds, who 
only waited till my back was turned to mill me. So much 

c

did this provoke me, that I let fly, and killed three of the 
•U^lefectors 5 and afterwards served them as they do notori- 
Dus tliieves in England, hung them up in chains, as a terror 
to others. And, indeed, so good an effect had this, that 
they not only forsook the corn, but all that part of the island, 
so long as these criminals hung there. 

My corn having ripened apace, the latter end of Decem- 
ber, which was .tny second harvest, I reaped it with a sithe, 
made of one of my broad swords. I had no fatigue in cut- 
ting down my first crop, it was so slender. The ears I car- 
ried home in a basket, rubbing it with my hands, instead of 
thrashing it 3 and when the harvest was over, found my half 
peck of seed produced near two bushels of rice, and two 
bushels and a half of barley. And now I plainly foresaw, 
that, by God’s goodness, I should be furnished with bread ; 
but yet I was concerned, beeause I knew not how to grind 
or make meal of my corn, or bread, neither knew how to 
bake it. I would not, however,^ taste any of the crop, but 
resolved to preserve it against next season, and, in the 
mean while, use my best endeavours to provide myself with 
other food. 

But where were my labours to end ? The want of a 
plough to turn up the earth, or shovel to dig it, I conquered 
by making me a wooden spade. The want of a harrow I 
supplied myself with dragging over the corn a great bough 
of a tree. When it was growing I was forced to fence it ; 
when ripe to mow it, carr}' it home, thrash it, part it from 
the chaff, and save it. And, after all, I wanted a mill to grind 
it, sieve to dress it, yest and salt to make it into bread, and 
an oven to bake it. This set my brains to work to find 
some expedient for every one of these necessaries against, the 
next harvest. 

And now having more seed, my first care was to prepare 
'me more land. I pitched upon two large flat pieces of 
ground near my castle, for that purpose, in which I sowed 
my seed, and fenced it with a good hedge. This took me 
np three months : by which time the wet season coming on, 
and the rain keeping me within doors, I found several oc- 
casions to employ myself ; and, while at work, used to di- 
vert myself in talking to my parrot, learning him to know 
dnd speak his own name PoUy the first welcome word I ever 
heard spoke in the island. I had been a long time con- 
triving how to make earthen vessels, which I wanted ex- 



09 norntf^oN. clausot. Si 

tremcly, and “when I considered the heat of the climate, I did 
not doubt but if I could tind any such^clay, 1 might poteh 
up a pot, strong enough when dried in the sun, to bear 
handling, and to hold any thing that was dry, as corn, meal, 
and other things. 

To be short, the clay i found ; but it would occasion the 
most serious person to smile, to see what awkward ways I 
took, and what ugly nrishapen things I made ; bow many 
either fell out or cracked by the violent beat of the sun, and 
fell in pieces when they were removed : so that I think it 
was two months time before 1 could perfect any thing ; and 
even then but two clumsy things in imitation of earthen jars. 
Tliese, however, 1 very gently placed in wicker baskets, 
made on purpose for them, and between the pot and the 
baskets, stuffed it full of rice and barley-straw, and these I 
presumed would hold my dried corn, and perhaps the meal 
w hen the corn vras bruised. As for the smaller things, I 
made them with better success ,* such as little round pots, 
flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, the sun baking them very 
hard. 

Yet still I wanted one thing absolutely necessary, and that 
was an earthen pot, not only to hold my liquid, but also to 
bear tbe fire, which none of these could do. It once hap- 
pened, that as I was putting out my fire, I found therein a 
broken piece of one of my vessels burnt as hard as a rock, 
‘and red as a tile. This made me think of burning some pota, 
and having no notion of a kiln, or of glazing them with lead, 
I fixed three large pipkins, and two or three pots in a pile 
one upon another. The fire 1 piled round the outside, and 
dry wood upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red 
hot, and found that they were not cracked at all : and when 
1 perceived them perfectly red, I let one of them stand in 
the fire about, five or six hours, till the clay melted by the 
extremity of the heat, and would have run to glass had I 
suffered it : upqn which I slackened my fire by degrees, 
till the redness abated ; and watching them till morning, I 
found I had three very good pipkins, and two earthen pots, 
as well burnt and fit for my turn as I could desire. 

No joy could be greater than mine this discovery. For 
after this, I may say I wanted for no sort of earthen-ware. 
I filled one of my pipkins w*th water to boil me some meat, 
which it did admirably well, and with a piece of kid^ I 
made me some good broth, as well as my circumstances 
would afford me at that time. 



^ UF£ AND ADVSNTUR^^ 

€ next concern I had, was to get me a stode mortar to 
beat some corn in, instead of a mill to grind it. Here, in- 
^deed 1 was at a great loss, as not being fit for a stone-cutter; 
and many days I spent to find out a great stone big enough 
to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar, and strong enough 
to bear the weight of a pestle, and that would break the corn 
without filling it with sand. But all the stones of the island 
being of a mouldering nature, rendered my search fruitless ; 
and then i resolved to look out for *a great block of hard 
wood, which having found, I formed it with my axe and 
hammer, and then, with infinite labour, made a hollow in it, 
just as the Indians of Brazil make their canoes. When I 
had finished this, I made a great pestel of iron wood, and 
then laid them up against my succeeding harvest. 

My next business was to make me a sieve to sift my meal, 
and part it from the bran and husk. Having no fine thin 
canvas to scarce the meal through, I could not tell what to 
do. What linen I had was reduced to rags : I had goat's 
hair enough, but neither tools to work it, nor did I know 
how to spin it : At length I remembered I had some neck- 
cloths of calico or muslin of the sailors, which I had brought 
out of the ship, and with these I made three small sieves, 
proper enough for the work. 

I come now to consider the baking part. The want of 
an oven I supplied by making some earthen pans very broad 
but not deep. When I had a mind to bake, I made a great 
fire upon the hearth, the tiles of which I had made myself ; 
an4 when the wood was burnt into live coals, I spread them 
over it, till it became very hot : -then sweeping them away, 
I set down my loaves, and whelming down the earthen pots 
upon them, drew the ashes and coals all round the outsides 
of the pot to continue the heat ; and in this manner I baked 
my barley loaves, as ^vell as if I had been a complete pastry- 
cook, and also made of the rice several cakes and puddings. 

It is no wonder that these things took me up the best 
part of a year, since what intermediate time I had was be- 
stowed in managing my new harvest and husbandry ; for in 
tlie proper season I reaped my corn, carried it home, and 
laid it up in the ea|: in ray large baskets, till I had time to 
mb, instead of thrashing it. And now indeed, my corn 
increased so much, that it produced me twenty bushels o 
barley, and as much rice, that I not only began to use it 
fireely, but was thinking how to enlarge my barnsi and re-

solved to sow as much at a time as would be srufficient for 
me for a whole year. 

All this while, the prospect of land, which I had seen 
from the other side of the island, ran in my mind. I still 
meditated a deliverance from this place, though the fear 
of greater misfortunes might have deterred me from it. For 
allowing that 1 had attained that place, I ran the hazard of 
being killed and eaten by the devouring cannibles 3. and if 
they were not so, yet f might be slain, as other Europeans 
had been, who fell into their hands. Notwithstanding all 
this, my thoughts ran continually upon that shore. I now 
wished for my boy Xury, and the long boat with the shoul- 
der of mutton sail ; I went on the ship’s boat that had been 
cast a great way on the shore in the late storm. She wa^ 
removed but a little ; but her bottom being turned up by 
the impetuosity and fury of the waves and wind, I fell t<x 
work with all the strength 1 had, with levers and rollers I 
had cut from the wood, to turn her, and repair the damages 
she had sustained. This work took me up three or four 
weeks, when finding my little strength all in vain, I fell to 
undermining it by digging away the sand, and so to make 
it fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and jguide it in 
the fall. But after this was done, I was still unable to stir it 
up, or to get under it, much less to move it forwards towards 
the water, and so was forced to give it over. 

This disappointment, however, did not frighten me. I 
began to think whether it was not possible for me to make 
a canoe or perigua, such as the Indians make of the trunk 
of a tree. But here I lay under particular inconveniences 5 
want of tools to make it, and want of hands. to move it in 
the water when it was made. However, to work I went 
upon it, stopping all the inquiries 1 could make, with thiF 
very simple answer I made to myself. Let’s first make iV 
ril warrant I’ll find some way or other to get it along when 
it is done, 

I first cut down a cedar-tree, which was five feet ten 
inches diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four 
feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, 
after which it lessened for a space, and then parted into 
branches. Twenty days was 1 a hacking and hewing this 
tree at the bottom, fourteen more in cutting off the branches 
and limbs, and a whole month in shaping it like the bottom 
of a boat. As for the inside, 1 was three weeks with a 
c 3 



54 life and adventukbs 

mallet and chissel, clearing it in such a manner, as that it 
was big enough to carry twenty-six men, much bigger than 
any canoe I ever saw in my life, and consequently sufficient 
to transport me and all my effects to that wished-for shore 
I so ardently desired. 

Nothing remained now, but indeed, the greatest difficulty 
to get it into the water, it lying about one hundred yards 
from it. To remedy the first inconvenience, which was a 
rising hill between the boat and the creek, with wonderful 
pains and labours I dug into the bowels of the earth, and 
made a declivity. But when this was done, all the strength 
I had was as insufficient to remove it, as it was when I at- 
tempted to remove the boat. I then proceeded to measure 
the distance of ground, resolving to make a canal in order 
to bring the water to the canoe, since I could not bring the 
canoe to the water. But as this seemed to be impracticable 
to myself alone, under the space of eleven or twelve years, 
it brought me into some sort of consideration ; so that 1 
concluded this also to be impossible, and the attempt alto- 
gether vain. I now saw, and not before, what stupidity it 
is to begin work before we reckon its cost, or .judge rightly 
our own abilities to go through with its performance. 

In the height of this work my fourth year expired, from 
the time I was cast on this island. At this time I did not 
forget my anniversary ; but kept it with rather greater de- 
votion than before. For now my hopes being frustrated, I 
looked upon this world as a thing I had nothing to do with ; 
and very well might 1 say, as father Abraham said unto Dives, 
“ Between thee and me there is a gulph fixed."' And in- 
deed 1 was separated from its wickedness too, having nei- 
ther the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the pride 
of life ; I had nothing to covet, being lord, king, and em- 
peror over the whole country I had in possession, without 
dispute and without control : 1 had loadings of corn, plenty 
of turtles, timber in abundance, and grapes above measure. 
What was all the rest to me ^ The money I had, lay by me 
as despicable dross, which I would freely have given for a 
gross of tobacco pipes, or a hand-mill to grind my coru ; in 
a word, the nature and experience of these things dictated 
to me this just reflection: That the good things of^this 
world are no further good to us^ than they are for our use ; 
and that whatsoever we may heap up to give to offiers, we 
can but eqjocy as much as we use and ho more. 



OF RO&IKSON CRUSOE. ^ 

These thoughts readiered' my miod niore easy than usual. 
Every time 1 sat down to meat, I did it with thapkifuliiess, 
admiring the providential baud of God, who, in this wilder^ 
ness, had spread a table to me. And now 1 considered what 
1 enjoyed, rather than what I wanted ; compared my present 
condition with what I at first expected it should be } how 
I should have done, if 1 had got nothing out of the ship ; 
that 1 must have perished before 1 had caught fish or turtles ; 
or lived, had I found* them, like a mere savage, by eating 
them raw, and pulling them to pieces with luy claw s, like a 
beast. I next compared my station to that which 1 deserv- 
ed ; how undutiful I had been to my parents ; how destitute 
of the fear of God j how void of every thing that was good ; 
and how ungrateful for those abundant mercies 1 had re- 
ceived from Heaven, being fed as it were, by a miracle* 
even as great as Elijah’s being fed by ravens ; and cast on 
a place where there is no venomous creatures to poison or 
devour me ; in short, making God’s tender mercies matter 
of great consolation, 1 relinquished all sadness, and gave 
way to contentment. 

As long as my ink continued, which with water 1 made 
last as long as 1 could, 1 used to minute down the da^ s of the 
month on which any remarkable event happened. — And, 

First, I observed, that the same day 1 forsook my parents 
and friends, and ran away to Hull, iii order to go to sea’; the 
same day afterwards in the next year, 1 was taken and made 
a slave by the S^Iee rovers. ^ 

That the very day 1 escaped out of the wreck of the ship 
in Yarmouth roads, a year after on the same day, 1 made 
my escape from Salee in my patron’s fishing-boat. 

And, on the 30 th of September, being the day in the year 
1 was born on, on that day twenty-six years after, was I 
miraculously saved, and cast ashore on this island. 

The next thing that wasted after my ink, was the bis- 
cuits which 1 had brought out of the ship 3 and though 1 al- 
lowed myself but oue cake a day for above a twelvemonth, 
yet I was quite out of bread for near a year, before I got 
any corn of my own- 

la the next place, my clothes began to decay, and my 
linen had been gone long before. However, I had pre- 
served about three dozen ’of the sailors’ chequered shirts, 
which proved a great refreshment to me, when the violent 
beams of the sun would not suii'er me to bear any of the sea- 

c 4 



56 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

men's heavy watch-coats ; which made me turn tailor, and 
after a miserable botching manner, convert them to jackets. 
To preserve my head, I made me a cap of goat’s ^kin, with 
the hair outwards to keep out the rain ; which indeed served 
me so well, that afterwards I made me a waistcoat and open- 
kneed breeches of the same: And then I contrived a sort of 
an umbrella, covering it with skins, which not only kept out 
the heat of the sun, but rain also. .Thus being easy and 
j^ettled in my mind, my chief happiness was to converse with 
God, in most heavenly and comfortable ejaculations. 

For five years after this I cannot say any extraordinary 
thing occurred to me. My chief employment was to cure^ 
my raisins, and plant my barley and rice, both of which I 
had a year’s provision beforehand. Buf^ though I was dis- 
appointed in my first canoe, I made it at intermediate times, 
my business to make a second, of much inferior size ; and it 
was two years before I had finished it. But as I perceived 
it would no wise answer my design of sailing to the other 
shore, my thoughts were confined to take a tour round the 
island, to see what further discoveries I could make. To 
this intent, after having moved her to the water, aiid tried 
how she would sail, I fitted up a little mast to my boat, and 
made a sail of the ship’s sail that lay by me. 1 then made 
lockers or boxes at the end of it, to put in necessaries, pro- 
vision, and ammunition, which would preserve them dry, 
either from rain or the spray of the sea ^ and in the inside 
of the boat, I cut me a long hollow place to lay my gun in j 
and to keep it dry, made a flag to hang ovfer it. My um- 
brella I fixed in a step in the stern, like a mast, to keep the 
heat of the sun oflf me. And now resolving to see the cir- 
cumference of my little kingdom, I victualed my ship for 
the voyage, putting in two dozen of my barley-bread loaves, 
ah earthen pot full of parched rice, a little bottle of rum, 
half a goat, powder and shot, and two watch coats. It was 
the 6th of November, in the Cth year of my reign, or capti- 
vity, that I set out in this voyage ; which was much longer 
than I expected, being obliged to put farther out, by reason 
of the rocks that lay a great way in the sea. And indeed 
so much did these rocks surprise me, that I was for putting 
back, fearing that if I ventured farther it would be out of 
my power to return. In this uncertainty 1 came to an an- 
chor just on shore, to which I waded with my guii on my 
shoulder and then climbing up a hill, which overlooked 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 57 

that point I saw the full extent of it, and so resolved to run 
all hazards. 

In this prospect from the hill, 1 perceived a violent cur- 
rent running to the'^east, coming very close to the point j 
which 1 the more carefully observed, thinking it dangerous, 
and that when I came to it, I might be drove into the sea 
by its force, and not able to return to the island ; and cer- 
tainly it must have been so, had I not made this observation ; 
for on the other side was the like current, with this differ- 
ence, that it set oft* at a greater distance ; and I perceived 
there was a strong eddy under the land ; so that my chief 
business was to work out of the first current, and conveni- 
ently get into the eddy. Two days T staid here, the wind 
blowing very briskly £. S. E. which being contrary to the 
current, leaves a great breach of the sea upon the point j 
so it was neither fit for me to keep too near the shore, on 
account of the breach ; nor stand at too great a distance, for 
fear of the streams. That night the wind abating, it grew 
so calm that I ventured out ; and here I may be a monu- 
ment to all rash and ignorant pilots ; for I was no sooner 
come to fhe point, and not above the boat's length from 
shore, but 1 was got into deep water, with a current like a 
mill, which drove my boat along so violently, that it was im- 
possible for me to keep near the edge of it, but forced me 
more and more out from the eddy to the left of me ; and all 
I could do with my paddles were useless, there being nci 
wind to help me. 

Now I began to look upon myself as quite lost, since, as 
the current ran on both sides of the island, I was very cer- 
tain they must join again, and then I had no hopes but of 
perishing for want in the sea, after what provisions I had 
was spent, or before, if a storm should happen to arise. 

Who can ^conceive the present anguish of my mind at 
this calamity? With longing eyes did I look upon my little 
kingdom, and thought the island the pleasantest place in 
the universe. Happy, thrice happy desert, said l,*shall I 
never see thee more ? Wretched creature ! whither urn I 
going ? Wliy did I murmur at my lonesome condition, when 
now I would give the whole world to be thither again ? 
While I was thus complaining, I found myself to be driven 
about two leagues into the sea; however, I laboured till 
niy strength was far spent, to keep my boat far north aft 
possibly I could, to that side of the current where the eddy 
^ . c 5 



58 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

lay on. About noon 1 perceive a little breeze of wind 
spring up from the S. S. E, which overjoyed my heart; and 
v^s still more elated, when in about half an hour, it blew a 
gentle line gale. Had any thick weather sprung up, I bail 
been lost another way ; for having no compass on board, 1 
should never have found the way to steer towards the island, 
if it had once disappeared j but it proving the contrary, 1 
set up my mast again, spread my sail, and stood away 
northward as much as I could, to get lud of the current. And 
no sooner did the boat begin to stretch away, but I perceiv- 
ed, by the clearness of the water, a change of the current 
was near ; for, where it was strong, the water w as foul ; 
and where it was clear the current abated. To the east, 1 
soon saw about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some 
rocks, which caused it again to separate ; and as .the main 
force of it drove away more southerly, leaving the rocks 
to the north east ; so the other came back by the repulse of 
the rocks, making a sharp eddy, which returned back again 
to the north-west with a very swift stream 

They who have experienced what it is to be reprieved 
upon the ladder, or to be saved from thieves, just, going to 
take away their lives, or such as have been in the like cala- 
mities with my ov^^n, may guess my present excess of joy ; 
how heartily I ran my boat into the stream of this eddy, 
and how joyfully I spread my sail to the refreshing wind, 
standing clieerfully before it, with a smart tide under foot. 
By the assistance of this eddy, 1 was carried above a league 
home again, when being in the wake of the island, betwixt 
the two currents, 1 found the water to be iu a sort of a stand. 
About four o'clock in the afternoon, 1 reached within a 
league of the island, and perceived the points of the rock, 
which caused this disaster, stretching out, as 1 observed be- 
fore, to the southward, which throwing oft’ the currents more 
southwardly, had occasioned another eddy to the north. But 
Raving a fair brisk gale, I stretched across this eddy, and in 
an hour came within a mile of the shore, where 1 soon 
landed to my unspeakable comfort ; and after an bumble 
prostration, thanking God for my deliverance, with reso- 
lution to lay all thoughts of escaping aside, I brought my 
boat safe to a little cove, and laid me down to take a wel- 
come repose. When 1 awoke, 1 was considering how I 
might get my boat home ; and coasting along the shore, I 
came to a good bay which ran up to a rivulet or brook^ 



QF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 59 

M^here fiodiug a good harbour, 1 stowed her as safe as if she 
had been in a dry dock made on purpose for her. 

I now perceived myself not far from the place where be- 
fore 1 had travelled on foot ; so taking nothing with me, ex- 
cept my gun, and umbrella, 1 began my journey j and in the 
evening came to my bower, where I again laid me down to 
rest. I had not slept long before 1 was awakened ih great 
surprise, by a strange voice that called me several times, 
“ Robin, Robin, Robinson Crusoe, poor Robin ! Where 
“ are you, Robinson Crusoe ( Where are you ? Where have 
you been 

So fast was I asleep at first, that I did not awake thorough- 
ly : but half asleep and half awake, 1 thought 1 dreamed 
that somebody spoke to me. Rut as the voice repeated 
Kobinsc^ Crusoe several times, being terribly affrighted, I 
started up in the utmost confusion ; and no sooner were my 
eyes fully open, but I beheld my pretty Poll sitting on the 
top of the hedge, and soon knew that it was he that called 
me j for just in such bewailing laiignage 1 used to talk and 
leach him ; which he so exactly learned, that he would sit 
upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, 
“ Poor Robinson Crusoe, where are you? where have you 
been ? how came you here?” and such like prattle 1 had 
constantly taught him. But even though I* knew it to be the 
parrot, it was a great while before I could adjust myself; 
being amazed how the creature got thither, and that he 
should fix about that place, and no where else. But now 
being assured it could be no other than my honest Poll, my 
wonder ceased, and reaching out my hand, and calling fami- 
liarly Poll, the creature came to me, and perched upon my 
thumb as he was wont, constantly prating to me with Poor 
“ Robinson Crusoe, and how did I come here, and where 
** had I been ?” as if the bird was overjoyed to see me ; and 
so I took him home along with me. 

I w as now pretty well cured of my rambling to sea ; yet I 
thought I could get my boat, which had cost me so much trou- 
ble and pains, on this side the island once more, but which 
indeed was impracticable, I therefore began to lead a very 
retired life, living near a twelvemonth in a very contented 
manner wanting for nothing except conversation. As to 
mechanic labours, which* my necessities obliged me to, I 
fancied I could, upon occa'sfon, make a tolerable carpenter, 
were the poor tools I hatl to work with, but good. Besides, 

c G 



6<X LIFE AND A*DVENTURBS 

as I improved in my earthen>ware, I contrived to make them 
with a wheel, which I found much easier and better, making 
my work shapely, which before was rude and ugly. But I 
think, I was never so elated with my own performance or 
project, than for being able to make a tobacco-pipe, which, 
though it proved an awkward clumsy thing, yet it was very 
sound, and carried the smoke perfectly well, to my great 
satisfaction. 

I aFso improved my wicker ware, making me abundance of 
necessary baskets, which, though not very handsome, were 
very handy and convenient lo fetch things home in, as also 
for holding my stores, barley, rice, and other provisions. 

My powder beginning to fail, made me examine after 
what manner I should kill the goats or birds to live on after 
it was all gone. Upon which I contrived many ways to 
ensnare the goats, and see if I could catch them alive, par- 
ticularly a she-goat with young. At last I had my desire ; 
for, making pitfalls and traps baited with barley and rice, 1 
found one morning, in one of them, an old he-goat, and in 
the other, three kids, one male, the other two, females. 

So boisterous was the old one, that I could not bring him 
away. But I forgot the old proverb, “ That hunger will 

tame a lion j” for had I kept him three or four days with- 
out provisions, and tlien gave him some water, with a little 
corn, he would have been as tame as a young kid. The 
other creatures I bound with strings together j but I had 
great difficulty before I could bring them to my habitation. 
It was some time before they would feed ; but throwing them 
sweet corn, it so much tempted them that they began to be 
lamer. From thence I concluded, that if I designed to fur- 
nish myself with goat’s flesh, when my ammunition was 
spent, the tamely breeding them up, like a flock of sheep, 
about my settlement, was the only method I could take. I 
concluded also, I must separate the wild from the tame, or 
else they would always run wild as they grew up ; and the 
best way for this, was to have some inclosed piece of ground 
well fenced, either with a hedge or pale, to keep them so 
effectually, that those within tnight not break out, or those 
without break in. Such an undertaking was very great for 
one pair of hands ; but as there was an absolute necessity 
for doing it, my first careAvas to jind a converiient piece of 
ground where there was likely to be herbage for them to eat» 
water to drink^ and cover to keep them from the sun. 



T)F ROBINSON. CRVfeOE. €l 

Here again I gave another instance of my ignorance and 
inexperience, pifching upon a piece of meadow land so large, 
tliat had I enclosed it, tlie hedge or pale Iiad been at least 
two miles about. Indeed, liad it been ten miles, I had 
time enough to do it in ; but then I did not consider that my 
goats would be as wild in so much compass, as if they had 
had the whole island, and consequently as ditHcult for me 
to catch them. This thought came into my head, after I 
had carried it on, 1 believe, about fifty yards j I therefore 
altered my scheme, and resolved to inclose a piece of ground 
about one hundred and fifty yards in length, and one hun- 
dred in breadth, sutficient enough for as many as would main- 
tain me, till such time as my ftock increased, and then I could 
add more ground. 1 now vigorously prosecuted my work, 
and it took me about three months in hedging the first pieco, 
in which time I tethered the three kids in the best pjlrt of 
it, feeding them as near me as possible, to make them fami- 
liar ; and indeed I very often would carry some ears of bar- 
ley, or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand ^ by 
which they grew so tanie, that when my enclosure was 
finished^ and I had let them loose, they would run after me 
for a handful of corn. This indeed answered my end ; and 
in a year and a half’s time, I had a flock of about twelve 
goats, kids and all ; and in two years after, they amounted 
to forty-three, besides what I had taken and killed for my 
sustenance. After which I enclosed five several pieces of 
ground to feed them in, with pens to drive them into, that 
1 might lake them as I had occasion. 

In this project I likewise found additional blessings 5 for 
1 not only had plenty of goafs flesh, but milk too, which in 
my beginning I did not so much as think of. And indeed, 
though 1 had never milked a cow, mucli less a goat, or seen 
butter or cheese made, yet after some essays and miscarri- 
ages, I made me both, and never afterwards wanted. 

How me;cifully can the omnipotent Power comfort his 
creatures, even in the midst of their greatest calamities I 
He can sweeten the^ bitterest providences, and give us rea- 
son to magnify him in dungeons and prisons ! what a boun- 
teous table was here spread in a wilderness for me, where I 
expected nothing at first but to perisji for hunger I

There sat my royal majesty, an absolute prince and ruler of 
my kingdom, attended by my dutiful subjects, whom, if I

pleased, I could either hang, draw, quarter, give them li- 
berty, or take it away. When I dined, I seemed a king, eat-^ 
ing alone, none daring to presume to do so till I had done, 
Poll, as if he had been my principal court favourite was th^ 
only person permitted to talk with me. My old, but faith- 
ful dog, now grown exceedingly crazy, and who had no spe- 
cies jto multiply his kind upon, continually sat on my right- 
hand 3 while my two cats sat on each side of the table ex- 
pecting a bit from my hand, as a principal mark of my roy- 
al favour. These were not the cats I had brought from the 
ship 5 they had been dead long before,* and interred near my 
habitation by my own hand. But one of tlfem as I suppose, 
generating with a wild cat, a couple of their young 1 had 
toa^ tame ; the rest run wild into the woods, and in time 
grevv so impudent as to return and plunder me of my stores, 
till such time as I shot a great many, and the rest left me 
w'ithout troubling me any more. In this plentiful manner 
did I live, wanting for nothing but conversation One thing 
indeed concerned me, the want of my boat ; I knew not 
which way to got her round the island. One time I resolved 
to go along. the shore by land to her ; but had any one in 
England met with such a figure, it would either have affright- 
ed them, or made them burst into laughter; nay, I could 
not but smile to myself at my habit, which I think in this 
place will be very prop^^r to describe. 

The cap I wore on my head, was great, high, and shape- 
less, made of a goat's skin, with a flap or peiit-liouse hang- 
ing down behind, not only to keep the sun from me, but to 
shoot the rain oft' from ruuuiug into my neck, nothing being 
more pernicious tiian the rain falling upon the flesh in these 
climates. I had a short jacket of goat's skin, whose hair 
hung down such a length on each side, that it reached down 
to the calves of iny legs. As for shoes and stockings, I had 
none, but made a semblance of some thing, 1 know not what 
to call them ; they were made like buskins, and laced on 
the sides like spatterdashes, barbarously shaped like the rest 
of my habit. 1 had a broad belt of goat's skin dried, girt 
round me with a couple of thongs, instead of buckles j on 
each of which, to supply the deficiency of sword and dag- 
ger, hung my hatchet and saw. 1 had another belt, not so 
broad, yet fastened in the same manner, which hung over 
my shoulder, and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung 
Iwo pouches, made of goat’s skin, to hold my powder and 



OF ROBINSON CRgsp5. 

(Jiot. My basket I carried on my back, and my gun on my 
shoulder; and over my head a great clumsy ugly goalfs 
skin umbrella, which however, next to my gun, was the 
most necessary thing about me. As for my face, the colour 
was not so swarthy as the Mulattoes, as might leave been 
expected from om' who took so little care of it, in a climate 
within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. At one time 
my beard grew so long that it hung down about a quarter 
of a yard ; but as I bad both razors and scissors in store, I 
cut it all otf, and sulVercd none to grow, except a large pair 
of Mabonictan whiskers, the like of which I had seen wore 
by some Turks at Salec, not lopg enough indeed to hang a 
hat upon, but of such a monstrous size, as would have amaz- 
ed any in England to have seen. 

But all tliis was of no consequence here, there being none 
to observe my behaviour or habit. And so without fear 
and without control, 1 jiroceeded on my journey, the prose- 
cution of which took me !ip live or six days. I tirst travellea 
along the scii-shoie, directly to the place w here I tirst brought 
my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks ; but now having 
no boal to take care of, 1 went over land a nearer way to 
the same height that I was before upon j when looking for- 
ward to the point of the rock, which lay out, and which 1 
was forced to double with my boat, 1 was amaifod to ^ee the 
sea so smooth and quiet, there being no ripi)ling motion, 
nor current, any more than in other places. Tiiis made me 
ponder some time to guess the reason of it, when at last I 
was corivijiced that the ebb setting from tije west and joining 
with the current of water from some great river on shore, 
must he the occasion of these rapid streams ; and that con- 
sequently, as the winds blew more weslwardly or more 
southwardly, so the current came the nearer, or went the 
farther from the shore. To satisfy my curiosity, I waited 
there till evening, wdien the lime of eho being made, I 
plainly perceived from the rock the current again as before, 
w ith this difference, that it ran farther ofl', near a half a league 
from the shore, wliereas, in my expedition, it set close upon 
it, furiously hurrying me and my canoe along with it, which 
at another time it would not have done. And now I was 
convinced, that by observing the ebbing and flowing of the 
tide, I might easfiy bringr my boat round the island again. 
But when I began to think of putting it in practice the re- 
membrance of danger struck me with such horror 



64 


LIFE AND ADVENTURES 


that I changeli my resolution, and formed another, whicli 
was more safe, though more laborious 5 and this was to makt 
another canoe, and to have one for one side of the island, 
and one for the other. 

I had now two plantations in the island ; the tirst my 
little fortification, fort, or castle, with many large and spa- 
cious improvements; for by this time I had enlarged the cave 
behind me with several little caves, one within another, to 
hold my baskets, corn and straw. The piles with which I 
made my wall were grown so lofty and great, as secured my 
habitation. And near this commodious and pleasant settle- 
ment, lay my well-cultivated and improved corn-fields, which 
kindly yielded me their fruit in the proper season. My se- 
cond plantation was that near my country-seat, or little bow- 
er, where my grapes flourished, and where, having planted 
many stakes, I made enclosures for my goats, so strongly 
fortified by labour and time, that it was much stronger than a 
wall, and consequently impossible for them to break through. 
As for my bower itself, I kept it constantly in repair, and 
cut the trees in such a manner, as made them grow thick 
and wild, and form a most delighful shade. In the centre 
Df this, stood my tent, thus erected : 1 had driven four piles 
in the ground, spreading over it a piece of the ship’s sail ; 
beneath which 1 made a sort of a couch with the skins of 
the creatures 1 had slain, and other things ; and having laid 
thereon one of the sailor s blankets, which I had saved from 
the wreck of the ship, and covering myself with a great 
watch-coat, 1 took up this place for my country retreat. 

Very frequently from this settlement did I use to visit my 
boat, and keep her in very good order. And sometimes I 
would venture in her a cast or two from the shore, but no 
ftirther, lest either a strong current, a sudden stormy wind, 
or some unlucky accident, should hurry me from the island 
as before. But now I entreat your attention, whilst I proceed 
to inform you of a new, but most surprising scene of life 
which here befel me. 

You may easily suppose, that after having been here so 
long, nothing could be more amazing than to see a human 
creature. One day it happened,, that going to my boat, I 
saw the print of a man’s naked foot pn the shore, very evi- 
dent on the sand, as the toes, heels, and every part of it. — 
Had 1 seen an apparition of the most frightful shape, I could 
not have been more confounded. My willing ears gave 



<15 


OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

the strictest attention. I cast my eyes around, but could 
satisfy neither the one nor the other. I proceeded alter- 
nately to every part of the shore, but vrith equal effect; 
neither could 1 see any other mark, though the sand about 
it was as susceptible to take impression, as that which was 
so plainly stamped. Thus, struck with confusion and hor- 
ror, I returned to my habitation, frightened at every bush 
and tree, taking every^ thing for men ; and possessed with 
the wildest ideas : That night my eyes never closed. I 
formed nothing but the most dismal imaginations, conclud- 
ing it must be the mark of the devil’s foot which 1 had seen. 
For otherwise how could any mortal come to this island ? 
where was the ship that transported them ? and what signs 
of any other footsteps ? Though these seemed very strong 
reasons for such a supposition, yet (thought I) why should 
the devil rihke the print of his foot to no purpose, as I can 
see, when he might have taken other ways to have terrified 
me ? why should he leave his mark on the other side of the 
island, and that too on the sands, where the surging waves 
of the ocean miglit soon have erased the impression. Surely 
this action is not consistent with the subtlety of Satan, said 
1 to myself 3 hut rather must be some dangerous creature, 
some wild savage of the main land over against me, that 
venturing too far in the ocean, has been driven here, either 
by the violent currents or contrary winds ; and not caring 
to stay on this desolate island, has gone back to sea again. 

Happy indeed, said I to myself, that none of the savages 
had seen me in liiat place ; yet I was not altogether with- 
out fear, lest, having found my boat, they should return in 
numbers and devour me, or at least carry away all my corn 
and destroy my tiock of tame goats. In a word ah my re- 
ligious hopes vanished, as though 1 thought God would not 
now protect me by his power, who had so wonderfully pre- 
served me so long. 

What various changes of Providence are there in the life 
of man ? How changeable are our affections, according to 
different circumstances ? We love to day, what we hate to- 
morrow ; we shun one hour what we seek the next. This 
was evident in me in the most conspicuous manner : For I, 
who before had so much lamented my condition, in being 
banished from all human kind, was now even ready to ex- 
pire, when 1 considered tliat a man had set his foot on this 



GO 


UFE AND ADVENTURES 


desolate island. But when I considered my station ofdife, 
decreed by the infinitely wise and good providence of God, 
that I ought not to dispute my Creator’s sovereignty, who 
has an undoubted right to govern aiKi dispose of his crea- 
tures as he thinks convenient ; and that his justice and mer- 
cy could either punish or deliver me : 1 say, when 1 consi- 
dered all this, I comfortably found it my duty to trust sin- 
cerely in him, pray ardently to him. aud humbly resign my- 
self to his divine will. 

One morning lying on my bed, these words of the sacred 
writings came into my mind, “ Call upon me in the day of 
“ trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.” 
Upon this sentence, rising more cheerfully from my bed, 1 
offered up my prayers in the most heavenly inanner; and 
when I had done, taking up my Bible to read, these words 
appeared first in my sight : — “ Wait on the Lord, and be 
“ of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart : V/ait 
** I say on the Lord.’' Such divine comfort did this give 
me, as to remove all cause of sadness u])on that occasion. 

Thus, after a world of apprehensions and fears, lor three 
days and nights, I at last ventured out of my castle and 
milked ray goats, one of which was almost spoiled for want 
of it. I next (though in great fear) visited my bower, and 
milked my flocks there also > when growing bolder, I went 
down to the shore again, and measuring the print of the foot 
to mine, to see perhaps, whether 1 myself had not occasion- 
ed that mark, I found it much superior in largeness : and so 
returned home, now absolutely convinced that either some 
men had been ashore, or that the island must be inhabited, 
and therefore that I might be surprised before I was aware. 

I now began to think of providing for my security, and 
resolved in my mind many different schemes for that pur- 
pose. I first proposed to cut down my inclosures, and turn 
my tame cattle wild into the woods, that the enemy might 
not find them, and frequent the island ip hopes of killing 
the same. Secondly, 1 was for digging up^ my corn-fields 
for the very same reason. And, lastly, 1 concluded to de- 
molish my bower, lest, seeing a place of human contrivance, 
they might come farther, and find out, and attack me tu my 
little caatle. 

Such notions did the fear of danger suggest to me : and I 
looked, I thought, like the unfortunate king Saul, when not 
only oppressed by the Philistines, but also forsaken by God 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 09 

himself. And, it is strange, that a little before, having en- 
tirely resigned myself to the will of God, I should now have 
little confidence in him, fearing those^ more who could kill 
this fading body, than him who could destroy my immortal 
soul. 

Sleep was an utter stranger to my eyes that night; )et 
nature, spent and tired, submitted to a silent repose the next 
morning, and then joining reason with fear, 1 considered;, 
that this delightful and pleasant island might not be so en- 
tirely forsaken, as I might think ; but tliat the inhabitants 
from the other shore might sail, either with a design or firom 
necessity, by cross winds ; and, if the latter circumstance, 

1 had reason to believe they would depart the first oppor- 
tunity. However, my fear made me think of a place for re- 
treat upon an attack. I now repented that I had made my 
door to come out beyond my fortification ; to remedy which 
I resolved to make me a second one : I fell to work, there- 
fore, and drove betwixt that double row of trees, which I 
planted above twelve years before, several strong piles, 
thickening it with pieces of timber and old cables, and 
strengthening the foot of it w itli earth which I dug out of ray 
cave j I also made me seven holes, wherein I planted my 
muskets like cannon, fitting them into frames resembling 
carriages. This being finished with indefatigable industry, 
for a great way every where, I planted sticks of osiers like a 
wood, about twenty thousand of them, leaving a large space 
between them and my wall, tliat I might have room to see 
an enemy, and that they might not be sheltered among the 
young trees, if they offered to approach the outer wall.— 
And, indeed, scarce two years had passed over my head, 
when there appeared a lovely shady grove, and in six years 
it became a thick wood, perfectly impassable. For my safe- 
ty, I left no avenue to go in or out ; instead of which I set 
two ladders, one to a part of a rJck which was low, and 
then broke in, leaving room to place another ladder upon 
that ; so that when 1 took these down, it was impossible for 
any man to descend without hurting himself; and if they 
bad, they would still be at the outside of the outer waff. — 
But while I took all these measures of human prudewce for 
my own preservation, I was^not altogether unmindful of other 
affairs. To preserve my stock of tame goats, that the ene- 
my should not take ail at once, I looked out for the most

retired, part of the island, which was the place where 1 had 
lost myself before-mentioned, and there finding a clear piece* 
of land, containing three acres, surrounded with thick woods, 
1 wrought so hard, that in less than a month’s time, I fenced 
it so well round, that my docks were very well secured in 
it, and put therein two he-goats and ten she-goats. 

All this la1)our was occasioned purely by fearful appre- 
hensions, on account of seeing the prjnt of a mari’s foot. — 
And not contented yet with what I had done, I searched 
for another place towards the west point of the island, 
where I might also retain another flock. Then wandering 
on this errand more to the west of the island than ever I had 
yet done, and casting my eyes towards the sea, methought 
I perceived a boat at a great distance, but could not possi- 
bly tell what it was for want of my perspective glass. I 
considered then it was no strange thing to see the print of 
a man’s foot 5 and concluding them canibals, blessed God 
for being cast on the other side of the island, where none of 
the savages, as I thought, ever came. But when I came 
down the hill to the shore, which was the S. W. point of 
the island, I was soon confirmed in my opinion ; hor can 
any one describe my horror and amazement, when I saw 
the ground spread with skulls, hands, feet, and bones of 
human bodies ; and, particularly I perceived a space like a 
carcle, in the midst of which had been a fire, about which I 
conjectured these wretches sat, and unnaturally sacrificed 
and devoured their fellow-creatures. 

The horror and loathsomeness of this dreadful spectacle, 
both confounded my senses, and made me discharge from 
my stomach in an excessive manner. I then returned towards 
my habitation ; and, in my way thither, shedding floods of 
tears, and falling down on my bended knees, gave God 
thanks ‘for making my nature contrary to these wretches, 
and delivering me so long out of their hands. 

Though reason and my long residence here had assured 
me, that these savages never came up to the thick woody 
part of the country, and that I had no reason to be appre- 
hensive of a discovery ; yet such an abhorrence did I still 
retain, that, for two years after, I confined myself "only, to 
my three plantations ; I mean my castle, country-seat, and 
inolosure in the woods. And though in process of time my 
dreadful apprehensions began to wear away, yet my eyes 
were more vigilant for fear of being surprised, and I was 



OF ROBINSOl^ CRUSOE. «0 

Very cautious of my firing my gun, lest being heard by those 
creatures, they should proceed to attack me. I resolved, 
however, manfully to lose my life if they did, and went 
armed with three pistols, stuck to my girdle, which, added 
to the description I have given of myself before, made me 
look with a very formidable appearance. 

Thus my circumstances for some time remained very 
calm and undisturbed ; and when I compared my condition 
to others, I found itYavfrom being miserable. And indeed, 
would all persons compare their circumstances, ftot with 
those above them, but with tho'se innumerable unhappy ob- 
jects beneath them, 1 am sure we shpuld not hear thoic 
daily murniurings and complainings that are in the world. 
For my part 1 wanted but few things. Indeed, the terror 
which tlie savages had put me in, spoiled some inventions 
for my own conveniences. One of my projects was to brew 
me some beer ; a very whimsical one indeed, when it is con- 
sidered that I had neither casks sufficient, nor could I make 
any to j)reserve it in ; neither had 1 hops to make it keep, 
yest to make it work, nor a copper or kettle to make it boil. 
Perhaps, indeed, after some years I might bring* this to bear, 
as I had done other things. But now my inventions were 
placed another way ; and day and night I could think of 
nothing but how I might destroy some of these cannibals, 
when proceeding to their bloody entertainments ; and so sav- 
ing a victim from being sacrificed, that he might after be- 
come niy servant. Many were my contrivances after thb 
purpose, and as many more objections o<Jcurred, after I bad 
Imtched them. I once contrived to dig a hole under the 
place where they had made their fire, and put therein five or 
six pounds of gunpowder, which would consequently blow 
up all those that were near it \ and then I was loath to spend 
so much upon them, lest it should not do that certain execu- 
tion 1 could desire, and but only affright and not kill them* 
Having laid this design aside, 1 again proposed to myself to 
lie privately in ambush, in some convenient place, with my 
three guns double loaded, and let fly at them in the midst of 
their dreadful ceremony ; and having killed two or three of 
them at every shot, fall upon the rest suddenly with my 
three pistols, and not let one mother’s son escape. This 
imagination pleased my faftcy so much, that 1 used to dream 
of it in the night time. To put my desiga in executiosi 1

secret impressions of the mind, to the acting or not acting 
any thing that offered, for which I could yet assign no rea- 
son. But let it be how it will, the advantage of this con- 
duct very eminently appeared in the latter part of ray abode 
on this island : I am a stranger in determining whence these 
secret intimations of Providence derive ; yet methiuks they 
are not only some proof of the converse of spirits, but also 
of the secret communications they are supposed to have 
with those that have not passed through the gloomy vale of 
death. 

These anxieties of mind, and the care of my preservation, 
put a period to all future inventions and contrivances, either 
for accommodation or convenience. I now cared not to 
drive a nail, chop a stick, fire st gun, or make a fire, lest 
either the noise should be heard, or the smoke discover me. 
And on this account I used to burn my earthen-ware private- 
ly in a cave which I found in the wood, and which 1 made 
convenient for that purpose ; the principal cause that 
brought me here was to make charcoal, so that I might bake 
and dress my bread and meat without any danger. At that 
time, a curious accident happened me, which 1 * shall now 
relate. ^ 

While 1 was cutting down some wood for making ray 
charcoal, I perceived a cavity behind a very thick branch 
of underwood. Curious to look into it, I attained its mouth, 
and perceived it sufficient for me to stand upright in. But 
when I had entered, and took a further view', two rolling 
shining eyes, like flaming stars, seemed to dart themselves 
at me ; so that 1 made all the haste out that 1 could, as not 
knowing whether it w as a devil or a monster that had iaken 
his residence in that place. When I recovered a little from 
iny surprise, I called myself a thousand fools, for being 
afraid to see the devil one moment, who had now lived 
almost twenty years in the most retired solitude. And 
therefore resuming all the courage I bad, I took a flaming 
firebrand, and in I rushed again, I had not proceeded 
above three steps, when I was more affrighted than before 5 
for then I heard a very loud sigh, like that a of human crea- 
ture in the greatest agony, succeeded with a broken noise, 
resembling words half expressed, and then a broken sigh 
again. Stepping back, Lord !* (thought I to fiiyself) where 
am 1 got, into what enchanted place have I plunged my- 
self, such as are reported to conUki miserable captives, tiU

death puts an end to their sorrows ? And, indeed in such 
great amazement was I, that it struck me into a cold sweat ; 
and had my hat been on my head, I believe my hair would 
have moved it off. But again encouraging myself with the 
hopes of God's protection, I proceeded forward, and by the 
light of my firebrand, perceived it to be monstrous he-goat, 
lying on the ground, gasping for life, and dying of mere old 
age. ' At first I stirred. him, thinking to drive him out, and 
the poor ancient creature strove to get upon his feet, but 
was not able ; so I e’en let him lie still to affright the sava- 
ges, .should they venture into this cave. I now looked 
round me and found the place but small and shapeless. At 
the farther side of it, I perceived a sort of an entrance, yet 
so low, it must oblige me to creep upon my hands and 
knees to it j so, having no candle, I suspended my enter- 
prise till the next day, and then I came provided with two 
large ones of my own making. 

Having crept upon my hands and feet through this strait, 

I found the roof higher up, I think about twenty feet. But 
surely mortal never saw such a glorious sight before { The 
roof and walls of this cave reflected a hundred thousand 
lights to me, from my two candles, as though they we?e in- 
dented with shining gold, precious stones, or spar|t|inj{ 
^diamonds. And indeed, it was the most delightful cavli^^ 
or grotto of its kind that could be desired, though entirely 
dry. The floor was dry and level, and had a kind of 
gravel upon it ; no nauseous venomous 'creatures to be seen 
there, neither any damp or wet about it. I could find no 
fault but in the entrance, and I began to think that even 
this might be very necessary for iny defence, and therefore 
resolved to make it my most principal magazine. I brought 
hither two fowling-pieces, and three muskets, leaving only 
five pieces at my castle, planted in the nature cannon. 
Of the barrel of gunpowder which I took up out of the sea, 

1 brought away about sixty pounds of good powder, which, 
was not damaged ; and this, with a great quantity of lead 
for bullets, I removed from my castle to this retreat, now 
fortified both by art and nature. 

I fancied myself now like one of the giants of old, who 
were said to live in caves and, holes among the rocks, inac- 
cessible to any .but themselves j or at least, a most danger 
ous attempt. And now 1 despised both the cunning atid 
strength of the savages, either t,o find me out or to hurt me.

But I must not forgfet the old goat, which caused my late 
dreadful amazement. The poor creature gave up the ghost 
the day after my discovery ; and it being difficult to drag 
him out, 1 dug iiis grave, and honourably entombed him in 
the same place where he departed, with as much ceremony 
as any Welch goat that has been interred about the high 
mountain Penmanmawr. 

I think I now was in the twenty-third year of my reign, 
and my thoughts much easier than formerly, having contri- 
ved several pretty amusements and diversions to pass away 
the time in a pleasant manner. By this time my pretty Poll 
had learned to speak English, and pronounce his words 
very articulately and plain ; so that for many hours we used 
to chat together after a familiar manner, and he lived with 
me no less than twenty-six years. My dog, which was 
nineteen years old, sixteen of which he lived with me, died 
some lime ago of mere old age. As for my cats they mul- 
tiplied so fast, that I waS forced to kill or drive them into 
the woods, except two or three which became my particular 
favourites. Besides these, I continually kept two or three 
household kids about me, which I learned to feed out of my 
hand, and two more parrots Avhich could talk indifferently, 
and call Robinson Crusoe, but not so excellently as the first, 
as not taking that pains with them. I had also several sea- 
fowls which I had wounded and cut their wings ; and 
growing tame, they used to breed among the low trees 
about iny castle walls, all which made my abode very 
agreeable. 

But what unforeseen events suddenly destroy the enjoy- 
ment of this uncertain state of life, when we least expect 
them ! It was now the month of December, in the southern 
solstice, and particular time of my harvest, which required 
iny attendance in the fields ; when going out pretty early 
one morning, before it was day-light there appeared to me 
from the sea-shore, a flaming light, about two miles from 
me at the east end of the island, where I had observed some 
savages had been before, not on the other side, but to my 
great affliction, it was on my side the island. 

Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual apprehen- 
sions, that the savages would percieve my improvements, I 
returned directly to my castle,* pulled the ladder after me, 
making all things look as wild and natural as 1 possibly 
could. lu the next place put myself in a posture of de- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 75 

fence, loaded my muskets and pistols, and committing my- 
self to God’s protection, I resolved to defend myself till my 
last breath. Two hours after, impatient for intelligence, I 
set my ladder up to the side of the hill, where there was a 
flat place, and then pulling the ladder after me, ascended to 
the top, where, laying myself on my belly, with my perspec- 
tive glass, I perceived no less than nine naked savages, sit- 
ting round a small fire, eating, as I supposed, human flesh, 
with their two canoes hailed on shore, waiting for the flood 
to carry them ofl* again. You cannot easily express the con- 
sternation I was in at this sight, especially seeing them near 
me 5 but when I perceived their coming must be always with 
the current of the ebb, I became more easy in my thoughts, 
being fully convinced that I might go abroad with security 
all the time of flood, if they were not before landed. And, 
indeed, this proved just as I imagined j for no sooner did 
they all take boat and paddle away, but the tide made N. 
W. Before they went off, they danced, making ridiculous 
postures and gestures, for above an hour, all stark-naked : 
but whether men or women, or both, I could not percmvc. 
When I s*aw them gone, I took two guns upon my shoulders, 
and placing a couple of pistols in my belt, with my great 
sword hanging by my side, I went to the hill, where at 
first I made the discovery of these cannibals, and then saw 
there had been three canoes more of the savages on shore 
at that place, which with the rest were making over to the 
main land. 

But nothing could be more horrid to me, when going to the 
place of sacrifice^ the blood, the bones, and other ‘mangled 
parts of human bodies appeared in iny sight 5 and so fired 
was I with indignation, that I was fully resolved to be re- 
venged on the first that came there, though I lost my life in 
the execution. It then appeared to me, that the visits which 
they make to this island are not very frequent, it being fif- 
teen months before they came again : but still I tvas very 
uneasy, by reason of the dismal apprehensions of their sur- 
prising me unawares ; nor dared 1 offer to fire a gun on that 
side of the island where they used to appear, lest, taking the 
alarm, the savages might return with many hundred canoes, 
and then God knows in whaf, manner I should have made my 
end. Thus was I a year or more before I saw any of these 
devouring cannibals again.

But to wave this, the following accident, which demands 
attention, for a while eluded the force of my thoughts in re- 
venging myself on those Heathens. 

On the IGth of May '(according to my wooden calendar) 
the wind blew exceedingly hard, accompanied with abun- 
dance of lightning and thunder all day, and succeeded by 
a very stormy night. The seeming anger of the Heavens 
made me have recourse to my Bible. Whilst I was seri- 
ously pondering upon it, I was suddenly alarmed with the 
noise of a gun, which I conjectured was fired upon the 
ocean. Such an unusual surprise made me start up in a 
minute, when, with my ladder, ascending the mountain as 
before, that very moment a flash of fire presaged the report 
of another gun, which I presently heard, and found it was 
from that part of the sea where the current drove me away* 
I could not but then think, that this must be a ship in dis- 
tress, and that these were the melancholy signals for a speedy 
deliverance. Great, indeed, was my sorrow upon this occa- 
sion 5 but my labours to assist them must have proved alto- 
gether vain and fruitless. However, I brought together all 
the dry wood that was at hand, and making a pretty large 
pile, set it on fire on the hill. I was certain they plainly 
perceived it, by their firing another gun as soon as it began 
to blaze, and after that several more from the same quarter. 
All night long I kept up my fire : and when the air cleared 
up, I perceived something a great vi^ay at sea directly E. but 
could not distinguish what it was, even with my glass, by 
reason the weather was so very foggy out at sea. However, 
keeping my eyes directly fixed upon it, and perceived it did 
not stir, I presently concluded it must be a ship at anchor, 
and so very hasty I was to be satisfied, that taking the gun, 
I went to the S. £. part of the island, to the same rocks 
where I had been formerly drove away by the current : in 
which time the weather being perfectly cleared up, to my 
great sorrow, I perceived the wreck of a ship cast away up- 
on those hidden rocks I found when I was out with my boat ; 
and which, by making a kind of an eddy, were the occasion 
of my preservation. ^ 

Thus, what is one man's safety is another’s ruin ; for un- 
doubtedly this ship had been driven op them in the night, 
the wind blowing strong at E. N. E. Had they perceived 
the island, as 1 now guessed they had not, certainly, instead 
of firing their guns for help, they would rather have ven- 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 77 

tured in their boat, and saved themselves that way. 1 then 
thought, that perhaps they had done so, upon seeing my 
fire, and were cast away in the attempt j for I perceived 
no boat in the ship. But then 1 again imagined, that, per- 
haps, they had another vessel in company, which, upon 
signal, saved their lives, and took the boat up : or that the 
boat might be driven into the main ocean, where these poor 
creatures might be in the most miserable condition. But 
as all these conjectures were very uncertain, 1 could do no 
more than commiserate their distress, and thank God tor 
delivering me, in particular, when so many perished in the 
raging ocean. 

When I considered seriously every thing concerning this 
wreck, and could perceive no room to suppose any of them 
saved, I cannot explain, by any possible force of words, what 
longings my soul felt at this occasion, often breaking out in 
this manner : ** O that there had been but two or three, nay, 
“ even one person saved, that we might have lived together; 
“ conversed with, and comforted one another !’^ and so much 
were my desires moved, that when I repeated these wotds, 

Oh ! that there had been but one I’* my hands would 
clench together, and my fingers press the palms of my bands 
so close, that, had any soft thing been between, it would 
have crushed it mvoluiitarily, while my teeth would strike 
together, and set against each other so strong, that it requir- 
ed some time for me to part them. 

Till the last year of my being on this island, I never knew 
whether or not any had been saved out of this ship. 1 had 
the afiliction some time after, to see the corpse of a drowned • 
boy come on shore, at the end of the island which was next 
the shipwreck ; there was nothing on him but a seaman’s 
waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue 
linen shirt, but no particular mark to guess what nation he 
was of. In his pocket were two pieces of eight, and a to- 
bacco-pipe, the last of which I preferred much more than I 
did the first. And now the calmness of the sea tempted me 
to venture out in my boat to this wreck, not only to get 
something necessary out of the ship, but perhaps some liv- 
ing creature might be on board, whose life I might preserve. 
This such an influence upon my^mind, that immediately 
1 went home, and prepared every thing necessary for the 
voyage, carrying on board my boat provisiovs of all sorts,

\\'itU a good quantity of rum, fresh water, and a con) pass ; 
30 putting off, I paddled the canoe along the shore, till I 
came at last to the north-east part of the island, from whenc« 

I was to launch into the ocean ,* but here the currents ran so 
violently, and appeared so terrible, that my heart began to 
fail me 5 foreseeing that if I was driven into any of these 
currents, I might be carried not only out of reach or sight 
of the island, but even inevitably lost in the boiling surges 
of the ocean. 

So oppressed was I at these troubles, that I gave over my 
enterprise, sailing to a little creek on the shore, where step- 
ping out, I set me down on a rising hill, very pensive and 
thoughtful. I then perceived that the tide was turned, and 
the flood came on, which made it impracticable for me to 
go out for so many hours. To be more certain how the sets 
of the tides or currents lay when the flood came in, I ascend- 
ed a higher piece of ground, which overlooked tiie sea both 
ways ; and here I found that as the current of the ebb set 
out close by the south point of the island, so the current of 
’ ^^od set in close by the shore of the north side ; and 

dUhat I had to ';'.r ‘0 ""ft'* 

in my return. . 

That night I reposed myself m my cano«^ fSvered with 
my watch-coat, instead of a blanket, the heavens being my 
tester. I set gut with the first of the tide full north, till J 
felt the benefit of the current, which carried me at a great 
rate eastward, yet not with such impetuosity as before, as 
to take from me all government of my canoe j so that in two 
hours time I came up to the wreck, which appeared to me 
a most melancholy sight. It seemed to be a Spanish vessel 
J>y its building, stuck fast between two rocks j her stern and 
quarter beaten to pieces by the sea j her mainmast and fore- 
mast were brought off by the boards that is, broken oft* short. 
As I approached near, I perceived a dog on board, who, 
seeing me coming, yelped and cried, and no sooner did 1 
call him, but the poor creature jumped into the sea, out of 
which 1 took him up, almost famished with hunger and 
thirst ; so that when I gave him a cake of bread, no raven- 
ous wolf could devour it more greedily ; and he drank to 
that degree of fresh water, that ^e would have burst himself, 
had 1 suffered him. 

The first sight I met with in the ship, were two men drown- 
ed in the cook-room or forecastle, inclosed in one another’s

arms t bifence I very probably supposed^ that when the ves- 
sel strUch in the storm, so high and inc^santly did the wa- 
ters break in and over her, that the men not l>eing able to 
bear it, were strangled by the constant rushing in of the 
waves. There were several casks of liquor, whether wine 
or brandy I could not be positive, which lay in the lower 
hold, as were plainly perceptible by the ebbing out of the 
water, yet were too large for me to pretend to meddle with ; 
likewise I perceived several chests, which 1 supposed to be- 
long to the seamen, two of which I got into my boat, with- 
out examining what was in them. Had the stern of the ship 
been fixed, and the forepart broken off, I should have made 
a very prosperous voyage ; since, by what I after found in 
the&^ two chests, I could no otherwise conclude, but that 
the ship must have abundance of wealth on board ; nay, if 
I must guess by the course she steered, she must have been 
bound from Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the 
southern parts of America, beyond the Brazils, to the Har 
vanah, in the gulph of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. 
V» hat became of the rest of the sailors, I could not certainly 
tell j and all her riches signified nothing at that time to any 
body. 

Searching further, I found a cask, containing about twen- 
ty gallons, full of liquor, which, with some labour, I got in- 
to my boat j in her cabin were several muskets, which I let 
remain there, but took away with me a great powder-horn, 
with about four pounds of powder in it. 1 took also a fire- 
shovel and tongs, two brass kettles, a copper pot to make 
chocolate, and a gridiron, all which were extremely necessary 
to me, especially the fire-shovel and tougs. And SO with 
this cargo, accompanied with my dog, I came away, the tide 
serving for that purpose ; and the same evening, about an 
hour within night, 1 attained the island after the greatest toil 
and fatigue imaginable. 

That night I reposed my wearied limbs in the boat, re- 
solving the next morning to harbour what I bad gotten in 
my new-found subterraneous grotto ; and not to carry my 
cargo home to my ancient castle. Having refreshed myself, 
and got all my effects on shore, 1 next proceeded to ex- 
amine the particulars ; apd so tapping the cask, I found 
the liquor to be a kind of rum, but not like what we had at 
the Brazils, nor indeed near so good. At the opening of

the chest, several things appeared very useful to me, for in- 
stance, I found in one a very fine case of bottles, contain- 
ing the finest and best sorts of cordial waters ; each bottle 
held about three pints, curiously tipt with silver. I found 
also two pots full of the choicest sweetmeats, and two 
more which the water had utterly spoiled. There were 
likewise several good shirts, exceedingly welcome to me ; 
and about one dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs 
and coloured neckcloths, the former of which was absolute- 
ly necessary for wiping my face in a hot day ; and, in the 
till, I found three bags of pieces of eight, about eleven hun- 
dred in all, in one of which, decently wrapped up in a piece 
of paper, were six doubloons of gold, and some small bars 
and wedges of the same metal, which I believe might weigh 
wear a pound. In the other chest, which I guessed to be- 
long to the gunner’s mate, by the mean circumstances which 
attended it, I found only some clothes of very little value, 
except about two pounds of fine glazed powder, in three 
flasks, kept, as 1 bfelieve, for charging the fowlingpieces on 
any occasion j so that, in the whole, I had no great advan- 
tage by this voyage. The money was indeed as mere dirt 
to me, useless and unprofitable, all which I would have free- 
ly parted with for two or three pair of English shoes and 
stockings ; things that for many years I had not wom, ex- 
cept lately those which I had taken oft* the feet of those un- 
fortunate men I found drowned in the wreck, yet not so 
good as English shoes, either for ease or service, I also 
found in the seaman’s chest about fifty pieces of eight in 
royals, but no gold ) so concluded that what 1 took from 
the first belonged to an officer, the latter appearing to have 
a much inferior person for its owner. However, as despi- 
cable as the money seemed, I likewise lugged it to my cave, 
laying it up securely as I did the rest of my cargo ; and af- 
ter I had done all this, I returned back to my boat, rowing 
and paddling her along till 1 came to my old harbour, where 
I carefully laid her up, and so made the best of my way to 
my castle. When I arrived there, every thing seemed safe 
and quiet : so that now my only business was to repose 
my sell after my wonted manner, and take care of my do- 
mestic affairs. But though I nyght have lived very easy, 
'as wanting nothing absolutely needful; yet still I was iboi« 
vigilant than usual upon account of the savages, never goitig 
much abroad •, or, if 1 did, it was to the osst part of the

island, where 1 was well assured the savages never came, 
and where I might not be troubled to carry that heavy load 
of weapons for my defence, as I was obliged to do if I went 
the other way. 

Two years did I live in this anxious condition, in all which 
time, contrary to my former resolutions, my head was filled 
with nothing but projects and designs, how I might escape 
from this island ; and so much were my wandering thoughts 
bent upon a rambling disposition, that had I had the same 
boat that I went from Salee in, I should have ventured once 
more to the uncertainty of the raging ocean. 

I cannot, however, but consider myself as one of the un- 
happy persons, who make themselves wretched by their dis- 
satisfaction with the station which God has placed them in ; 
for, not to take a review of my primitive condition, and my 
father’s excellent advice, the going contrary to which was, 
as I may say, my original sin, the following mistakes of the 
same nature certainly had been the means of my present 
unhappy station. What business had I to leave a settled 
fortune ancfwell stocked plantation, improving and increas- 
ing, where, by this time, I might have been worth a hun- 
dred thousand moidores, to turn super-cargo to Guinea, to 
fetch Negroes, when time and patience would so much en- 
large my stock at home, as to be able to employ those 
whose more immediate business it was to fetch them home 
even to ray door. 

But as this is commonly the fate of young heads, so a se- 
rious reflection upon the folly of it ordinarily attends the 
exercise of future years, when the dear bought experience 
of time teaches us repentance. Thus was it with me 5 but, 
notwithstanding, the thoughts of my deliverance ran so 
strongly in my mind, that it seemed to check all the dictates 
of reason ai^d philosophy. And now to usher in my kind 
reader with greater pleasure to the remaining part of my 
relation, I flatter myself it will not be taken amiss, to give 
him an account of my first conceptions of the manner of 
escapnng, and upon what foundation I laid my foolish 
schemes. 

Having retired to my castle, after my late voyage Ip the 
ship, my frigate laid up and secured, as usual, and my con 
dition the same as before^ except being richer, though 1 bad

night in March, being the rainy season, in the four and 
twentieth year of my solitude, 1 lay down to sleep, very 
well in health, without distemper, pain, or uncommon un- 
easiness either of body or mind 5 yet, notwithstanding, I 
could not compose myself to sleep all the night long. All 
this tedious while, it is impossible to express what innumer- 
able thoughts came into my head. 1 traced quite over the 
whole history of my life in miniature, from my utmost re- 
membrance of things till 1 came to this island, and then 
proceeded to examine every action and passage that had 
occurred since I had taken possession of my kingdom* In 
my reflections upon the latter, I was comparing the happy 
posture of my afl’airs in the beginning of my reign, to this 
life of anxiety, fear, and concern, since I had discovered a 
print of a foot in the sand ; that while 1 continued without 
apprel^ensions I was incapable of feeling the dread and ter- 
ror I now sufl'ered. How thankful rather ought I to have 
been for the knowledge of my danger, since the greatest 
happiness one can be possessed of is to have suflicient time 
to provide against it How stupendous is the goodness of 
Providence, which sets such narrow bounds to the sight and 
knowledge of human nature, that while men walk in the 
midst of so many dangers they are kept serene and calm, by 
having the events of things hid from tlieir e^ es, and knowing 
nothing of those many dangers that surround them, till per- 
haps they are dissipated and vanish away. 

When I came more particularly to consider of the real 
iianger I had for so many years escaped ; how I had walked 
about iu the greatest security and tranquillity, at a time 
perhaps, when even nothing but the brow of a hill, a great 
tree, or the common approach of night, had interposed be- 
tween me and the destructhe hands of the cannibals, who 
would devour me with as good an appetite, as 1 would a 
pigeon or curlew ; surely all this I say, could not but make 
me sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, whose singular 
protection 1 acknowledge with tlie greatest humility, and 
without which 1 must inevitably have fallen into the cruel 
-hands oHhose devourers. 

Having thus discussed my thoughts in the clearest manner, 
according to my weak understanding, I next proceeded to 
consider the wretched nature of those destroying savages, 
by seeming, though with great revereuce, to .inquire, vyhy 
God should give up any of bis creatures to such inhumanity,

even to brutality itself, to devour its own kind ? but as this 
was rather matter of abstruse speculation, and as my miser- 
able situation made me think this of ^ine the most uncom> 
fortable situation in the world, I then began rather to inquire 
what part of the world these wretches lived in ; how far off 
the coast was from whence they came ; why they ventured 
over so far from home ; what kind of boats conveyed them 
hither 3 and why I could not order myself and my business 
so, that I might be able to attain their country, as they 
were to come my kingdom 

But then, thought I, how shall I manage myself when I 
come hither ? what will become of me if I fall into the 
hands of the savages ? or how shall I escape from them, if 
they make an attempt upon me ? and supposing I should not 
fall into their power, what shall I do for provisions, or which 
way shall I bend my course ? These counter thoughts threw 
me into the greatest horror and confusion imaginable ; but 
then 1 still looked upon my present condition to be the most 
miserable that possible could be j and that nothing could be 
worse, except death. For (thought I) could I but attain 
the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet with some re- 
lief, or coast it along, as I did with iny boy Xury, on the 
African shore, till I came to some inhabited country, where 
I might meet with some relief, or fall in with some Christian 
ship that might take me in 3 and if 1 failed, why then I could 
but meet with death, which would put an end to all my mi- 
series. These thoughts I must confess, were the fruit of a 
distempered mind, an impatient temper, made desperate, as 
it were, by long coutinuance of the troubles and disappoint- 
ments I had met with in the wreck, where I hoped to have 
found some living persons to speak to, by whom I might 
have known in what place I was, and of the probable means 
of my deliverance. Thus, while my thoughts were agitated, 
my resignation to the will of Heaven were entirely suspend- 
ed, so that I had no power to fix my mind to any thing, but 
to the project of a voyage to the main land. And, indeed, 
so much was I inflamed upon this account, that it set my 
blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat high, as though I. 
had been in a fever 3 till nature being, as it were, fatigued 
and exhausted with the thoughts of it, made me submit my- 
self to a silent repose. • 

In such a situation, it is very strange, that I did not 
dream of what I was so intent upon 5 but, instead of it, ray

mind roved on a quite different thing, altogether foreign. 
I dreathed, that as I was issuing from ray castle one morn- 
ing, as customary, when I perceived upon the shore two ca- 
noes, and eleven savages coming to land, who had brought 
with them another Indian, whom they designed to make a 
sacrifice of, in order to devour 5 but just as they were going 
to give the fatal blow, methought the poor designed victim 
jumped away, and ran directly into my little thick grove 
before my fortification, to abscond from his enemies wdien 
perceiving that the others did not follow him that way, I 
appeared to him 5 that he humbly kneeled down before 
me, seemed to pray for my assistance ; upon which I show- 
ed him my ladder, made him ascend, carried him to my cave, 
and he became my servant ; ‘and when 1 had gotten this 
man, I said to myself, now surely I may have some hopes 
to attain the main land ; for this fellow will serve me as a 
pilot, tell me what to do, and where I must go for provisi- 
ons, what places to shun, what to venture to, and what to 
escape. But when 1 awaked, and found all these inexpres- 
sible impressions of joy entirely vanished, 1 fell into the 
greatest dejection of spirit imaginable. 

Yet this dream brought me to reflect, that one sure w ay 
of escaping was to get a savage ; that after I had ventured 
my life to deliver him from the bloody jaws of his devourers, 
the natural sense he might have of such a preservation, 
might inspire him with a lasting gratitude and most sincere 
affection. But then this objection reasonably interposed : 
how can I effect this, thought I, without I attack a whole 
company of them, and kill them all ? why should I proceed 
on such a desperate attempt, which my scruples before had 
suggested to be unlawful ? and. indeed my heart trembled 
at the thoughts of so much blood, though it were a means 
to procure my deliverance. ’Tis true, I m^ght reasonably 
enough suppose these men to be real enemies to my life, 
men who would devour me, was it in their power ; so that 
it was self-preservation in the highest degree to free myself, 
by attacking them in my own defence, as lawfully as if 
they were actually assaulting me ; though all these things, 
I say, seemed to me to be of the greatest weight, yet, as I 
just said before, the dreadful thoughts of shedding human 
blood, struck such a terror to my soul that it was a long 
time before I could reconcile myself to it. 

But how far will the ardency of desire prompt us on ? For

notwithstanding the many disputes aud perplexities 1 had 
with myself, 1 at length resolved, right or wrong, to get one 
of these savages into my hands, cost what it would, or even 
though 1 should lose my life in the attempt. Inspired with 
this firm resolution, I set all my wits at work, to find out 
what methods I should take to answer my design : this in- 
deed, was so difficult a task, that I could not pitch upon any 
probable means to execute it : I therefore resolved continu- 
ally to be in a vigilant posture, to perceive when the savages 
came on shore, and to leave the rest to the event, let the 
opportunities offer as they w^ould. 

Such was my fixed resolutions; and accordingly I set my- 
self upon the scout, as often as 1 could, till such times as I 
was heartily tired of it. I waited for above a year and a half, 
the greatest part of w hich I went out to the west and south- 
west corner of the island, almost every day, to look for ca- 
noes, but none appeared. This was a very great discourage- 
ment 3 yet though I was very much concerned, the edge of 
my design was as keen as ever, and the longer it seemed to 
be delayed, the more eager was 1 for it; in a word, 1 never 
before was so careful to shun the loathing sight of these sa- 
vages, as 1 was now eager to be with them ; and I thought 
myself sufficiently able to manage one, two, or three savag- 
es, if 1 had them, so as to make them my entire slaves, to do 
whatsoever 1 should direct them, and prevent their being 
able at any time to do me a mischief. Many times did I use 
to please myself with these thoughts, with long and ardent 
expectations ; but nothing presenting, all my deep project- 
ed scliemes and numerous fancies vanished away, as though 
while I retained such thoughts, the decrees of Providence 
were such that no savages were to come near me. 

About a }ear and a half after, when I was seriously mu- 
sing of sundry other ways how I should attain my end, one 
morning early I was very much surprised by seeing no less 
than five canoes all on shore together, on my side the island, 
and the savages that belonged to them all lauded, aod out 
of my sight. Such a number of them disconcerted all ray 
measures ; for, seeing so many boats, each of which would 
contain six, and sometimes more, 1 could not tell what to 
think of it, or how to order my measures, to attack twenty 
or thirty men single-handed ; upon which, much dispirited 
and perplexed, I lay still in my castle ; which, however, I 
pi|t in a proper posture for an attack ; and having formerly 
provided all that was necessary, was soon ready to enter

upon an engagement, should they attempt. Paving waited 
for some lime my impatient temper would let me bear it no 
longer 5 I set my guns at the foot of the ladder, and, as 
usual, ascended up to the top of the hill at two stages, stand- 
ing, however, in such a manner, that my head did not ap- 
pear above the hill, so that they could not easily perceive 
me ; and liere, by the assistance of my perspective glass, I 
observed no less than thirty in number around a fire, feast- 
ing upon what meat they had dressed •; how they cooked it, 
or what it was, I could not then perfectly tell ; but they were 
all dancing and capering about the flames, using many 
frightful and barbarous gestures. 

But while, with a curious eye, I was beholding these 
wretches, my spirits sunk within me, when I perceived 
them drag two miserable creatures from the boats, to act 
afresh the dreadful tragedy, as I supposed they had done 
before. It was not long before one of them fell upon the 
ground, knocked down, as I suppose, with a club or \vood- 
en sword, for that was their manner 5 while two or three 
others went immediately to work, cutting him open for their 
cookery, and then fell to devour him as they had done the 
former, while the last unhappy captive was left by himself, 
till such time as they were ready for him. The poor crea- 
ture looked round him with a wishful eye, trembling at the 
thoughts of death ; yet, seeing himself a little at liberty, na- 
ture, that very moment, as it were, inspired him with hopes 
of life : He started away from them, and ran, with incredi- 
ble swiftness, along the sands, directly to that part of the 
coast where my ancient and venerable castle stood. 

You may well imagine I was dreadfully affrighted upon 
this occasion, when, as I thought, they pursued him in a 
whole body, all running towards my palace. And now, in- 
deed, I expected that part of my dream w^als going to be ful- 
filled, and that he would certainly fly to my grove for pro- 
tection ; but, for the rest of my dream, I could depend no- 
thing on it, that the savages would pursue him thithei, and 
find him there. However, my spirits beginning to recover, 
I still kept upon my guard j and I now plainly perceived 
there were but three men out of the number that pursued 
him. I was infinitely pleased with what swiftness the poor 
creature ran from his pursuers, ’gaining so much ground mp- 
on them, that I plainly perceived could he thus hold out ior 
half an hour, there was not the least doubt but he would 
save his life from the power of his enemies. 



OF ROBINSON CJIUSOE, 87 

Between them and my castle there was a creek, that 
very same which I sailed into with all my effects from the 
wreck of the ship, on the steep banks of which I very 
much feared the poor victim would be taken, if he could 
not swim for his escape : But soon was I out of pain for 
him, when I perceived he made nothing of it, though at 
full tide, but with an intrepid courage, spurred on by the 
sense of danger, he plunged into the flood, swimming over 
in about thirty strokes, and then landing, ran with the 
same incredible strength and swiftness as before^ When 
the three pursuers came to the creek, one of them, who I 
perceived could not swim, happily for his part, returned 
to his company, while the others, with equal courage, but 
much less swiftness, attained the other side, as though they 
were resolved never to give over the pursuit. And now 
or never I thought was the time for me to procure me a 
servant, companion, or assistant ; and that I was decreed 
by Providence to be the instrument to save this poor crea- 
ture's life. I immediately descended my two ladders with 
the greatest expedition j I took up my two guns, which, as 1 
said befcve, were at the bottom of them, and getting up 
again with the same haste toward^s the hill, I made nearer 
the sea. In a word, taking a short cut down the hill, I 
interposed between the pursuers and pursued ; hallooing 
aloud to the latter, who, venturing to look back, w'as, no 
doubt, as much terrified at me as I at them. I beckoned 
to him with my hand, to return back ; in the mean time 
advancing towards thq pursuers, and rushing on the fore- 
most, 1 knocked him down with the stock of my piece, 
and laid him flat on the ground. I was very unwilling to 
fire, lest the rest should hear, though, at a distance, I ques- 
tioned whether they could or no ; and being out of sight of 
the smoke, they could not easily have known what to make 
of it. The other savage seeing his fellow fall, stopped as 
if he had been amazed 5 when advancing towards him, 1 
could perceive him take his bow from his back, and, fix- 
ing an arrow to it, was preparing to shoot at me, and, with- 
out dispute, might have lodged the arrow in my breast ; 
but, in this absolutely necessary case of self-preservation, I 
inimediately fired at him, and shot him dead, just as his 
band was going to draw fatal string. All this while, 
the savage who had fled before, stood still, and had the sa- 
tisfaction to see bis enemies killed, as l;ie thought, who de*

signed to take away his life ; so affrighted was he with the 
fire and noise of my piece, that he stood, as it were, like 
Lot’s wife, fixed and immoveable, without either sense or 
motion. This obliged me to halloo to him again, making 
the plainest signs I could to him to draw nearer. I per- 
ceived he understood those tokens by his approaching to 
me a little. way, when, as if afraid I should kill him too, 
he stopped again. Several times did he advance, and as 
often stop in this manner, till coming more to my view, I 
perceived him trembling as if he was to undergo the same 
fate. Upon which I looked upon him with a smiling coun- 
tenance, and still beckoning to him, at length he came close 
to me, and kneeled down, kissing the ground, laid his head 
upon it, and taking me by the foot, set it upon his head * 
and this, as I understood afterwards, was a token of swear- 
ing to be my slave for ever. I took him up, and, making 
much of him, encouraged him in the best manner I could. 
But my work was not yet finished ; for 1 perceived the sa- 
vage whom I had knocked down, was not killed, but stun- 
ned with the blow, and began to come to himself. Upon 
which I pointed to my new servant, and showed him that his 
enemy was not yet expired ; he spoke some wor^s to me, 
but which 1 could not understand ; yet being the first sound 
of a man’s voice I had heard for above twenty-five years, 
they were very pleasing to me. But there was no time for 
reflection now, the wounded savage recovering himself so 
far as to sit upon the ground, which made my poor prisoner 
as much afraid as before j to put him out of fear^ I pre- 
sented rriy other gun at the man, with an intent to shoot 
him ; but my savage, for so 1 must now call him, prevented 
my firing, by making a motion to me to lend him a sword 
which hung naked in my belt by my side. No sofiner did I 
grant his request, but away he runs to his enemy, and at 
one blow cut off’ his head as dexterously as the most accom- 
plished executioner in Germany could have done; for it 
seems these creatures make use of w ooden swords made of 
hard wood, which will bear edge enough to cut off* heads 
and arms at one blow. When this valorous exploit was 
done, he comes to me laughing, as a token of triumph de- 
livered me my sword again, with abundance of snrprising 
gestures, laying it along with the bleeding and ghastly^ead 
of the Indian, at my feet. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOl.. 89 

The greatest astonishment that my new servant conceived, 
was the manner of killing the savage at such a distance, 
without a bow and arrow ; and such was his longing desire 
to know it, that he first pointed to the dead carcase, and 
then made signs to me to grant him leave to go to him. 
Upon which 1 bade him go, and, as well as 1 could, made 
him sensible 1 granted his request. But when he came 
there, how wonderfully was he struck with amazement'? 
First he turned him on one side, then on another, wonder- 
ing he could perceive no qanlity of blood, he bleeding 
inwardly ; and after sufficiently admiring the wound the 
bullets had made in his breast, he took up his bow and ar- 
rows, and came back again : upon which I turned to go 
away, making my signs to him to follow, lest the rest mis- 
sing their companions, might come in pursuit of them, and 
this I found he understood very well ; by his making me 
understand that his design was to bury them, that they might 
not be «een if it happened, and which by signs again I 
made him sensible I very "(much approved of. Immediately 
he fell to work, and never was a grave-digger more dexterous 
ill the wofld than he was : for in an instant, as I might say, 
he scraped a large hole in the sand with his hands, sufficient 
to bury the first in ; there he dragged him, and without any 
ceremony he covered him over ; in like mariner he served 
the other 3 so that I am sure no undertaker could be more 
expert in his business ; for all this was done in less than a 
quarter of an hour. I then called him away, and instead 
of carrying him directly to my castle at first, 1 conveyed him 
to my cave on the farther part of the island ; and so my 
dream was now fulfilled in that particular, that my grove 
should prove an asylum or sanctuary to him. 

Weary and faint, hungry and thirsty, undoubtedly must 
this poor creature be, supported chiefly by the vivacity of 
spirit, and uncommon transports of joy that his deliverance 
occasioned. Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins 
to eat, and water to drink, on which he fed very cheerfully, 
to his exceeding refreshment. 1 then made him a conveni- 
ent bed with a parcel of rice straw, and a blanket upon it, 
(a bed which 1 used myself sometimes,) and then pointing 
to it, made signs for him to lie down to sleep, upon which 
the poor creature went to take a welcome repose. 

Indeed he was a very comely handsome young fellow, ex- 
tremely well-made, with straight long limbs, not too largCi

LIFE 'AND ADVENTURES 


but tall and well shaped, and, as near as I could reckoiii 
about twenty-six years of age. His countenance had no- 
thing in it tierce or surly, but rather a sort of majesty in his 
face 5 and yet, especially when he smiled, he iiad all the 
sweetness and softness of an European. His hair was not 
curled like wool, as many of the blacks are, but long and 
black, with the most beautiful yet careless tresses spreading- 
over his shoulders. He had a very.high and large forehead, 
with a great vivacity and sparkling sliarpness in his eyes. 
His skin was not so tawny as the Virginian Brazilians, or 
other Americans, but rather of a bright dun olive colour, 
tliat had something agreeable in it, though not very easy to 
give a description of. His face was round and plump, with 
a small nose, very different from the flatness of the Negroes, 
a pretty small mouth, thin lips, fine teeth, very well set, 
and white as the driven snow. In a word, such handsome 
features, and exact symmetry in every part, made me con- 
sider, that I had saved the life of an Indian prince, no less 
graceful Und accomplished than the great Oroonoko, whose 
memorable behaviour, and unhappy contingen<jes of^life, 
fiavc charmed the world, both to admiration of his person, 
and compassion to his sufferings. 

But let him be either prince or peasant, all my Happiness 
centered in this, that I had aow got a good servant or com- 
panion, to whom, as he deserved, 1 was resolved to prove a 
kind master, and a lasting friend. He had not 1 think, slept 
above an hour, when he awaked again, aud while I was 
milking my goats hard by, out he runs from the cave to- 
wards me in my inclosure, and laying himself down on the 
ground, in the lowest prostration, made all the antic gestures 
imaginable, to express his thankfulness to me, for being liis 
deliverer. 1 confess, though the manner of his behaviour 
seemed to me ludicrous enough to occasion laughter, yet 1 
was very much moved at his affection, so that my heart 
melted within me, fearing he might die away in excess of joy, 
like reprieved malefactors : especially as I was incapable 
either to let him blood, or administer physic. It were to 
be wished that Christians would take example by this Hea- 
then, to have a lasting remembrance of the benefits and de- 
liverances they have received, *,by the kind meditation and 
powerful interposition of their benefactors and 4diverers : 
and it would be likewise happy for mankind, were ^ere no 
occasion to blame many, who, instead of thankfully acknow- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


ledging favours and benefits, rather abuse and condemn 
those who have been the instruments to save them from de- 
struction. 

But leaving these reflections, I returned to the object 
that occasioned them ; for my man to conclude the last ce- 
remony of obedience, laid down his head again on the ground 
close to my foot, and set my other foot upon his head, as he 
had done before, makipg all the signs of subjection, servi- 
tude, and submission imaginable, and let me understand he 
would serve me as long as his life endured. As. I under- 
stood him in many things, 1 made him sensible 1 was very 
well pleased with him ; and, in a little time, 1 began to speak 
to him, and learn him to talk to me again. In the first place 
1 made him understand his name was to be Friday, because 
it was upon that day 1 saved his life ; then I taught him to 
say Master, which 1 made him sensible was to be my name. 
1 likewise taught him to say Yes and No, and to know what 
they meant. 1 gave him some milk in an earthen pot, mak- 
ing him view me while 1 drank it before him, and soaked my 
bread in it j 1 gave him a cake of bread, and caused him to 
soak II iiKewise, lo wnicn lie reaQuy ulGklllg 

of the greatest satisfaction imagiimblc. 

All that night did I keep him there ; but no sooner did 
the morning light appear, when 1 ordered him to arise, and 
come along w ith me, with certain tokens that I would give 
him some clothes like mine, at which he seemed very glad, 
being stark naked, without the least covering whateveri— 
As we passed by the place where the two men had been in- 
terred, my man pointed directly to th'eir graves, showing me 
the marks he had made to find them again, giving me to un- 
derstand, by signs, that we should dig them up and devour 
them. At this 1 appeared extremely displeased, expressed 
my utmost abhorrence, as if I would vomit at the apprehen- 
sion of it, beckoning with my hand to come away, which be 
did with the greatest reverence and submission. After this 
I conducted him to the top of the hill, to view it the rest of 
the savages were yet remainang there ; but when 1 looked 
through my perspective glass, 1 could see no appearance of 
them, nor of their canoes 5 so that it was very evident they 
never minded their deccased-companions whom we had slain ; 
which if they had, they would surely have searched for, or 
left one boat behind for them to follow, after they returned 
from their pursuit. 



LIFE And adventures 


m 

Curiosity, and a desire of satisfaction, animating me with 
courage to see this scene of barbarity, I took my man Fri- 
day w:th me, putting a sword into his hand, -with the bow 
and arrows at his back, which I perceived he could use 
very dexterously, causing him to carry one gun for me, and 
1 two for myself ; and thus equipped against all attacks, 
away we marched directly to the place of their bloody en- 
tertainment. But when I came tliAe, I Was struck with the 
utmost horror at so dreadful a spectacle, whilst Friday was 
no way concerned about it, being no doubt in his turn one 
of these devourers. Here lay several human bones, there se- 
veral pieces of mangled flesh, half eaten, mangled and scorch- 
ed ; whilst streams of blood ran promiscuously as waters 
from a fountain. As I was musing on this dreadful sight, 
Friday took^ all tho pains he could, by particular signs, to 
make me understand, tliat they had brought over four pri- 
soners to feast upon, three of whom tliey had eaten up, and 
that he was the fourth pointing to himself; that there hav- 
ing been a bloody battle between them and his great king, 
in the just defence of whom he was taken prisoner, with 
many others, all of tliese were carried oft* to differeut place# 
to be devoured by their conquerors j and that it was his mis- 
fortune to be brought thither by these wretches for the same 
purpose. 

After I was made sensible of these things, I caused Fri- 
day to gather these horrid remains, and lay them together 
upon a heap, whidi ! ordered to be set on fire, and burnt 
them to ashes. My man, however, still retained the nature 
of a cannibal, having a hankering stomach after some of the 
flesh ; but such an extreme abhorrence did I express at the 
least appearance of it, that he durst not but conceal it; for 
I made him very sensible, that if he ofl’ered any such thing, 
I would certainly shoot him. 

This being done, 1 carried my man With me to my castle, 
and gave him a pair of linen drawers, which 1 had taken 
out of the poor gunner’s chest before mentioned, and which, 
with a little alteration, fitted him very well : in the next 
place I made him a jerkin of goat’s skin, such* as my skill 
was able to manage, and indeed 1 thought myself then a to- 
lerable good tailor. I gave him also a cap which I made of 
a hare’s skin, very convenient ^d fashionable. — Thus being 
clothed tolerably well, my man was no less pmud of his 
habit, than I w as at seeing him in it. Indeed he went very 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 95 

awkwardly at first, the drawers being too heavy on his 
thighs, not used to bear any weight, and the sleeves of the 
waistcoat galled his shoulders and the inside of his arms j 
but by a little easing where he complained they hurt him, 
and by using himself to them, at length he took to them 
very well. 

My next concern was, where I should lodge him ; and 
that I might do well by him, and yet be perfectly easy my- 
self, I erected a tent for him in the vacant place between 
my two fortifications, in the inside of the last, and the out- 
side of the first ; and, as there was an entrance or door in- 
to my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a door 
to open on the inside ; I barred it up in the night time, tak- 
ing in my ladders too, so that, was my man to prove treach- 
erous, there could be no way to come at me in the inside of 
my innermost wall, without making so much noise in get- 
ting over, that it must needs waken me ; for my first wall 
had now a complete roof over it of long poles, spreading 
over my tent, and leading up to the side of the mountain, 
which was again laid across with smaller sticks instead of 
laths, and’thatched over a great thickness witlf the rice straw, 
which was as strong as reeds : and at the hole of the place, 
left on pill pose to go in and out by the ladder, had placed a 
kind of trap-door, which, if it had been attempted on the 
outside, would not have opened at all, but have fallen down, 
and made a great noise : and as to my weapons, every night 
I took tliem all to my bedside. 

But there was no occasion for this precaution ; for surely 
a master never had a more sincere, faithful, and loving ser- 
vant than Friday proved to me. Without passion, sullen- 
ness, or design, perfectly obliging and engaging, his affec- 
tions were as much tied to me, as those of a child to its pa- 
rents j and I might venture to say, he would have sacrificed 
his life for the saving of mine, upon any occasion whatso- 
ever. And, indeed, the many testimonies he gave me of 
this, sufficiently convinced me that I had no occasion to use 
these precautions. And here I could not but reflect with 
great wonder, that however it hath pleased the Almighty 
in his providence, and in the government of the creation, to 
take from so great a part of^the world of his creatures, the 
noblest uses to which their faculties, and the powers of their 
souls are adapted ; yet that he has bestowed upon them the 



94 


LIFE AND ADVENTUiliiKls; 


same reason, affeetions, sentiments of kindness and obliga- 
tion, passions of resentment, sincerity, fidelity, and all the 
capacities of doing and receiving good that he has given us ; 
and that when he is graciously pleased to offer them occa** 
sions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more ready, 
to apply them to the proper uses for which they were be- 
stowed, than we often are. These thoughts would make 
me melancholy, especially when I considered how mean a 
use we make of all these, even though we have these pow- 
ers enlighteued by the Holy Spirit of God, and by the 
knowledge of this worid, as an addition to our understand- 
ing ; and why it has pleased the heavenly wisdom to con- 
ceal the like saving knowledge from so many millions of 
souls, who would certainly make a much better use of it 
than generally mankind do at this time. These reflections 
would sometimes lead me so far as to inveigh the sovereign- 
ty of Providence, and, as it were, arraign the justice of such 
an arbitrary disposition of things, that should obscure that 
light from some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a 
like duty from all. But I closed it up, checking my thoughts 
with this conclusion ; first. That we were ignorant of that 
right and law by which tliose should be condemned ; but as 
the Almighty was necessarily, and by the nature of his es- 
sence, infinitely just and holy ; so it could not be otherwise, 
but that if these creatures were all destined to absence from 
himself, it was on account of sinning against that light, 
which, as tlie Scripture says was a law to themselves, and 
by such a rule as their consciences would acknowledge to 
be just, though the first foundation was not discovered to 
us. Aud, secondly, That still as we were the clay in the 
hand of the potter, no vessel could say thus to him, ** Why 
hast thou fashioned me after this manner.’' 

I had not been above two or three days returned to my 
castle, but my chief design was, how I should bring Friday 
off fipom this horrid way of feeding ; and to take from him 
that inhuman relish he by nature had been accustomed to, 
I thought it my duty to let him taste other flesh, which 
might the rather tempt him to the same abhorrence I so 
often expressed against their accursed way of living. Upon 
which, one morning I took him out with me, with an inten- 
tion to kill a kid out of the flock and bring it home, and 
dress it. As I was going, I perceived a she-goat lying down 



OF ROBINSON GRUSOE. 05 

in the shade, and two young kids sitting by her.— ‘Immedi- 
ately I catched hold of my man Friday, and bidding him 
stand still, and not stir, I presented my piece, an3 shot one 
of the kids. My poor servant, who at a distance perceived 
me kill^his adversary, and yet did not know by what means, 
or how it was done, stood trembling and surprised, and 
looked so amazed, that I thought he would have sunK into 
the earth. He did not see the kid I aimed at, or beheld I 
had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat to see if he was 
not wounded, thinking my resolution was to kill him j for 
coming to me, he fell on his knees, earnestly pronouncing 
many things which I did not understand the meaning of ; 
which at length I perceived was, that I would not take away 
his life. 

Indeed 1 was much concerned to see him in that con- 
dition, where nature is upon the severest trial, when the 
immediate hand of death is ready to put for ever a period 
to this mortal life j and, indeed, so much compassion had 1 
to this creature, that it was with difficulty I refrained from 
tears. But, however, as another sort of countenance was 
necessary,* and to convince him that I would do him no 
harm, I took him smiling by the hand, then laughing at 
him, and pointing to the kid which I had slain, made signs 
to him to fetch it, which accordingly he did. No less 
curious was he in viewing how the creature was killed, than 
he had been before in beholding the Indian j which, while 
he ^vas admiring at, I charged my gun again, and presently 
perceived a great fowl, like an hawk, perched upon a tree 
within shot : and, therefore, to let Friday understand what 
1 was going to do, I called him to me again, pointing at the 
fowl, which I found to be a parrot. I made him under- 
stand that 1 would shoot and kill that bird ; accordingly 1 
fired, and bade him look, when immediately he saw the 
parrot fall down. Again he stood like one amazed, not- 
withstanding all I had said to him : and the more confound- 
ed he was, because he did not perceive me put any thing 
into my gun. Undoubtedly a thing so utterly strange, 
carrying death along with it, far or near, either to man or 
beast, must certainly create the greatest astonishment to one 
who never had heard such thing in his whole life ; and 
really his amazement continued so long, that had I allowed 
it he would have prostrated himself before me and my gtto» 
with the greatest worship and adoration. As for the gun 



in particular/ he would not so much as touch it for several 
day9 after, but would come and communicate his thoughts 
to it, and talk to it, as if the senseless piece had understood 
and answered him 3 all this I could perceive him do, when 
he thbught my back was turned, the chief intent of which 
was, to desire it not to kill him, as 1 afterwards came to 
understand. 

I never strove to prevent his admiration, nor hinder him 
from those comical gestures he used on such occasions 3 but 
when his astonishment was a little over, I made tokens to 
him to run and fetch the parrot that I had shot ; which ac^ 
cordingly lie did, staying sometime longer than usual, by 
reason the bird not being quite dead, had fluttered some way 
further from the place where he fell. Tu the mean time, 
while he was looking for her, I took the advantage of charg- 
ing my gun again, so that I might be ready for any other 
mark that offered 3 but nothing more occurred at that time. 
So I brouglit home the kid, and the same evening took off 
the skin and divided the carcase as well as 1 could. Part of 
the flesh 1 stewed and boiled in ^ pot I had for this purpose. 
And then spreading my table, I sat down, giving my man 
some of it to eat, who was wonderfully pleased, and seemed 
to like it very well : but what was the most surprising to 
him was to see me eat salt with it : upon which he made me 
understand, that the salt was very bkd for me ; when put- 
ting a little into nis mouth he seemed to nauseate it in such 
a manner, as to spit and splutter at it, and then washed his 
mouth with fresh water : but to show him how contrary his 
opinion was to mine, I put some meat in my mouth without 
salt, and feigned to spit and splutter as much for the want 
of it, as he had done at it ; yet all this proved of no signi- 
fication to Friday 3 and it was a long while before he could 
endure salt in his meat or broth, and even then but a small 
quantity. 

Thus having fed him sufficiently with boiled meat and 
broth at that time, the next day I was resolved to feast him 
with a' roasted piece of the kid. And having no sipt to 
fasten it, nor jack to turn it, 1 made use of that common 
artifice which many of the common people of England have, 
that is, to set two poles upon each side of the fire, and 
one across on the top, hanging the meat thereon with a 
string, and ‘so turning round continually, roast it, in the 
same manner as we read bloody tyrants of old crually roast* 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOX. ft 

ed the holy martyrs. This practice caused great admirati- 
on in my man Friday, being quite another way than that to 
which the savages were accustomed. But when he came to 
taste the sweetness and tenderness of the flesh, he express- 
ed his entire satisfaction above a thousand different wayi^. 
And as I could not but understand his meaning, you may be 
sure I was as wonderfully pleased, especially when he made 
it also very plain to me, that he would never, while he lived, 
eat man’s flesh more. 

It was now high time I should set my servant to work ; 
so next day I set him to beat out some corn, and sift it in 
the same manner as I had done before. And really the fel- 
low was very quick and handy in the execution of any thing 
1 ordered him to go about. 1 made him understand that it 
was to make bread for us to eat, and afterwards let him see 
me make it. In short, he did every thing as I ordered him, 
and in a little lime as well as I could perform it myself. 

But now' considering that I had two mouths to feed in- 
stead of one, it was necessary that I must provide more 
ground for rny harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn, 
than I cd’nimonly used to do ; upon which I marked out a 
larger piece of land, fencing it in, in the same manner as 
1 had done before j in the execution of which 1 must give 
Friday this good word, that no man could work more hardy, 
or with better will than he did ; and when I made him sen- 
sible that it was for bread to serve him as well as me, he 
then very passionately made me understand, that he thought 
1 had much more labour on his account, than I had for my- 
self; and that no pains or diligence should be w'anting in 
him, if I would but direct him in those works wherein he 
might proceed. 

I must certainly own, that this was the most pleasant year 
1 ever had in the island ; for after some lime, Friday began 
to talk pretty well, and understood the names of those things 
which I was wont to call for, and the places where I used 
to send him. So that my long silent tongue, which had been 
useless so many years, except in an exclamatory manner, 
either for deliverance or blessings, now began to be occu- 
pied in teaching and talking to my man Friday; for indeed 
1 had such a singular satisfaption in the fellow himself, fio 
innocent did his simple and unfeigned honesty appear more 
and more to me every day, that 1 really began entirely to 
love him ; and for his part, I believe there was ho love lost, 

E 



and that his nature had been more charmed by this exceeding 
kindness, and his affection more placed upon me, than any 
other object whatsoever among his own countrymen. I once 
had a great mind to try if he had an hankering inclination 
to his own country again ; and by this time having learned 
the English so well, that he could give me tolerable answers* 
to any question which I demanded ; I asked him whether 
that nation to which he belonged, ever conquered in battle? 
The question caused Friday to smile, and to which he an- 
swered, “ Yes, yes, we always fight the better;” as much 
as to say they always got the better in fight. Upon which 
we proceeded on the following discourse : You say, said I, 
that you always fight the better 3 why, then, Friday, how 
came you to be taken prisoner ? 

Friday. But for all that, my nation beat much. 

Master. How say you, beat? if your nation beat them, 
how came you to be taken prisoner ? 

Friday. They more many mans than my nation in the 
place where me was 5 they take one, two, three, and me : 
my nation much over beat them in the yonder place where 
me no was, there my nations man beat one, two, three great 
tousand. 

Master. Then why did not your nation recover you from 
the bands of your enemies ? 

Friday. They run one, two, or three, and me : they make 
all go in the canoe ; my nation have no canoe that time. 

Master. 'Tis very well, Friday ; but what does your na- 
tion do with the prisoners they take ? Do they carry them 
away and eat them, as these have done ? 

Friday. Yes, yes, my nation eats mans too, eat up all. 

Master. To what place do they carry them to be devoured ? 

Friday. Go to other nations where they think. 

Master. Do they bring them hither ? 

Friday. Yes, come over hither, come over other place. 

Master. And have you been “^vith them here, Friday ? 

Friday. Yes, me been here (pointing to the notth-west 
of the island being the side where they used to land.) 

Thus having gotten what account I could from my man, 
1 plainly understood, that he had been as bad as any of the 
rest of the cannibals, having been formerly among the sar 
vages who used to come on shore on the farthest part of the 
island, upon the same bloody occasion as he was brought 
hither for ; and son^e time after 1 carried him to that place 



OF ROBINSON eRUSOB. m 

where he pointed 3 and no sooner did he come there, but 
he presently knew the ground, signifying tp me that he was 
once there when they eat up twenty men, two women, and 
a young child : but as he could not explain the number in 
English, he did it by so many stones in a row, making a 
»ign for me to count them. 

This passage 1 had the rather mentioned, because it led 
to things more important and useful for me to know ; for 
after 1 had the satisfactory discourse with him, my next 
question was, how far it was from the island to the shore, 
and whether the canoes were not often lost in the ocean ? to 
which he answered there was no danger ; that no canoes 
were ever lost ; but, that after a little way out to the seaj 
there was a strong current, and a wind always one way in 
the afternoon. This 1 thought at first to be no more th^n 
the sets of the tide, of going out or coming in 5 but I after- 
wards understood it was occasioned by the great draught 
and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or 
gulph of wliich I imagined my kingdom lay j and that the 
land which I perceived to the W. or N. W. must be the 
great island Trinidad, on the north of the river. A thou- 
sand questions (if that would satisfy me) did I ask Friday, 
about the nature of the country, tbe sea, the coasts, the in- 
habitants, and what nations were nearest them ; to which 
questions the poor fellow declared all he knew, with the 
greatest openness, and utmost sincerity. When 1 demand- 
ed of him the particular names of the various nations of his 
sort of peo}>Ie, he could only answer me in general, that 
they were called Caribbee, Hence it was I considered that 
these must be the Caribbees, so much taken notice of by 
our maps, to be on that part of America, which reaches 
from the mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guinea, and so 
on to St. Martha. Then Friday proceeded to tell me, that 
up a great way beyond the moon, as much as to say, be- 
yond the setting of the moon, which must be W. from their 
country, there dwelt white-bearded men, such as 1 was, 
pointing to my w hiskers, and that they kill much mans, I 
was not ignorant with what barbarity the Spaniards treated 
these creatures ; so that 1 presently concluded it must be 
them, whose cruelties had spread throughout America, to 
be remembered even to succeeding generations. 

Well, you may be sure, this knowledge, which the im- 
perfect knowledge of my man had led me wan very 

E 2 



comfortable to me, and made me so curious as to ask him 
how I might depart from this island, and get amongst those 
white men He told me, “ Yes, yes, I might go in two ca- 
noes.*’ In two canoes, thought I, what does my man mean? 
surely he means one for himself, and another for me and 
if not, how must two canoes hold me without being joined, 
or one part of my body being put in one, and another in 
another ? And indeed it was a long time before 1 understood 
his meaning, which was, that it must he a large boat as big 
as two canoes, able to bear with the waves, and not so lia- 
ble to be overwhelmed as a small one must be. 

I believe there is no state of life but what may be happy, 
if people would but endeavour for their part to make it so. 
He is not the happiest man that has the most riches ; but he 
that is content with what he has. Before 1 had my servant, 
I thought myself miserable till I had him ; and now that I 
had enjoyed the happy benefits of h^m, 1 still complained, 
and begged a deli\crance from a place of retirement, ease, 
and plenty, w'here Providence had sufficiently blessed me. 
In a word, from this lime 1 entertained some hopes, that 
one time or other 1 might find an opportunity to make my 
escape from this island, and that this poor savage might be 
a great furtherance thereto. 

All this lime since my man became so intelligent as to un- 
derstand and speak to me, 1 spared no pains or diligence 
to instruct him, according to my poor share of knowledge, 
in the principles of religion, and the adoration that he ought 
to pay to the true God. One time, as 1 very well remem- 
ber, I asked him who made him? At first the innocent 
creature did not understand what I meant, but rather thought 
I asked him who was his father? Upon which I took ano- 
ther way to malic him sensible, by demanding from him an 
answer to this question. Frida}, said I, who is it that made 
the sea, this ground whereon we walk, and all these hills 
aqd ^oods which we behold? and here indeed I did not miss 
iny intention ; for he told me it was Old Benamuekee (the 
God whom \ suppose these savages adored) w ho lived a great 
way beyond all. But as to his attributes, poor Friday was 
an utter stranger. He could describe nothing of this great 
person ; and all that he could say was, that he wgft very old, 
much older than the sea and land, the moon, or the stars. 
Friday, said 1 again, if this great and pld person has made 
all things in the world, how comes it to pass, that all things.

83 you in particular, do not adore and worship him ^ Upon 
this, looking very grave, with a perfect sweet look of inno* 
cence, be replied, Master, all things say O to hitn/' by 
which it may be reasonably supposed he meant adoration. 
And vviiere, said I, do the people of your country go when 
they die ? He answered to Benamuckec, What, and those 
people that are eaten up, do they go there ? “ Benamuckee,’^ 
said he, ‘‘ love ’em dearly 5 me pray to Benamuckee in de 
“ canoe, and Benamuckee would love me when they eat me 

all up.” 

Such discourses as these had 1 with my man, and such 
made me sensible, that the true God is worshipped, though 
under imperfect similitudes; and that the false adoration 
which the Heathens give to their imaginary Deity, is as great 
an argument of the divine essence, as the most learned Athe> 
ists (falsely so called ) can bring against it ; for God will be 
gloritied in his works, let their denomination be what it will ; 
and I cannot be of that opinion which some conceive^ that 
God should decree man to be damned for want of a right no- 
tion of faith, in a place where the wisdom of the Almighty 
has not permitted it to he preached ; and therefore cannot 
but conclude, that since obedience is the best sacrifice, these 
poor creatures, acting by that light and knowledge wltich 
they are possessed of, may, undoubtedly, obtain a happy sal- 
vation, though not that enjoyment with Christ, as his saints, 
confessors, and martyrs must enjoy. 

But laying these determinations aside, more fit for divinea 
than me to discuss, 1 began to instruct my servant in the sav- 
ing knowledge of the true Deity, in which the directions of 
God’s Holy Spirit assisted me. 1 lifted up my hands to Hea- 
ven, and pointing thereto, told him, that the great Maker 
of Heaven and Earth lived there ; that, as his infinite pow- 
er fashioned this world oht of a confused chaos, and made 
it in that beautiful frame which we behold, so fie govefoa 
and preserves it by his unbounded knowledge, sovereign 
greatness, and peculiar providence ; that he was omnipo- 
tent, could do every thing for us, give every tiling to us, 
and take every thing, away from us 3 that he was the reward- 
er and gunisher of good and ev\l actions ; that there was no- 
thing but what he knew, np thoughts so secret but what he 
could bring to light : and thus by degrees 1 opened his eyes» 
nhd descYihed to him the luauner of the creation of the

worlds the situation of paradise, the transgression of our 
fiiri&t parents, the wickedness of God's peculiar people, and 
the uiiiverskl sins and abominations of the whole earth. — 
When these things were implanted in his mind, I told him, 
that as God's justice was equal to his mercy, he resolved to 
destroy this world, till his Son Jesus Christ interposed in 
our behalf; and, to procure our redemption, obtained leave 
of his heavenly Father to come down from Heaven into the 
world, where he took human nature upon him, instucted us 
in our way to eternal life, and died as a sacrifice for our sins ; 
that he was now ascended into Heaven, mediating for our 
pardon, delivering our petitions and obtaining all those good 
benefits which we ask in his name, by humble and hearty 
prayers, all which were heard at the throne of Heaven. — 
As very frequently I used to inculcate things into his mind 
Friday one day told me, that if our great God could hear 
us beyond the sun, he must surely be a greater God than 
their Mtnamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet 
could not hear them till they ascended the great mountains, 
where he dwelt, to speak to him. What, said I, Friday, did 
you go thither to speak to him too'? He answered, ** No, 

they never went that were young men, none but old men, 

called their Oowakakee/^ meaning the Indian priests, “who 
“ went to say O, (so he called saying their prayers,) and they 
** returned back, and told them -what Benamuckee said." 
From hence I could not but observe how happy we Chris- 
tians are, who have God's immediate revelation for our cer- 
tain guide ; and that our faith is neither misled, nor our 
reason imposed upon, by any set of men, such as these Indi- 
an impostors. 

But, to clear up this palpable cheat to my man Friday, I 
told him, that the pretence of their ancient men going up to 
the mountain to say O to their God Benamuckee^ was an im- 
posture, and that their bringing back an answer was all a 
sham, if not worsen for that, if there was an.y such thing 
spoken to them, surely it must proceed from an infernal 
spirit. And here I thought it necessary to enter into a lopg 
discourse with him, which I did after this manner; 

Friday, said I, you must know, that before this wqrld was 
made, tliere was an Almighty power existing, by whose pow- 
er all things were made, and whose Majesty shall have no 
•ocJ. To be glorified and adored by beings of a heavenly 
nature, he created angeb and archangels, that is, glorified

lot 

spirits resembling himself, to encompass his throne, eteV>> 
nail)' singing forth his praise in his most heavenly sounds 
and divine harmony. And, among this heavenly choir, Lu« 
cifer bore a great sway, as being then one of the peculiar fa- 
vourites of these celestial abodes ; but he, contrary to that 
duty he owed his heavenly Sovereign, with unbounded ingra- 
titude to his Divine Creator, not only envied him that ado- 
ration which was his due, but thought to usurp that throne, 
which he had neither power to keep, nor title to pretend to. 
He raised a dissension and civil war in Heaven, and had a 
iiumlyr of angels to take^his part. Unbounded folly ! stu- 
pendous pride ! to hope for victory, and aspire above his 
powerful Creator ! I'he Deity, not fearful of such an enemy, 
yet justly provoked at his rebellion^ commissioned his arch- 
angel Michael to lead forth the heavenly host, and give him 
battle ; the advantage of which was quickly perceived by Sa- 
tan’s being overthrown, and the prince of the air, for so the 
devil is called, with all hi. lallcu angels, driven headlong in- 
to a dismal place which is called Hell, 

The recital of this truth made my man give the greatest 
attention, and he expre sed a great satisfaction by his ges- 
tures, that God had sent the devil into the deep hole. — And 
then I desired him to give great heed to what I had further 
to say. 

No sooner, proceeded I, was God freed from, and the 
Heaven clear of this arch-traitor, but the Father speaks to 
the Son and Holy Spirit, who belonged to his essence, and 
were equal to him in power and glory, Comt let us make rmUf 
said he, in our own image , after our own likeness^ Gen. i.^2d. 
to ha^ e dominion over the creatures of the world which we 
have created. And these he intended should glorify him in 
Heaven, according to their obedience in this state of proba- 
tion on earth, which was, as it were, to be the school to 
train them up for these heavenly mansions. Now, Satan see- 
ing himself foiled, yet that God had not taken the power 
from him as prince of the air, which power Heaven design* 
ed he should retain, whereby his creatures might be tried f 
in revenge for the disgrace be had rexeived, he tempts 
Adam s wife, Eve, to taste of the tree of knowledge of good 
and evil, which God had fprbidden. He appears to her in 
the shape of a serpent, then a most beautiful creature, and 
telk h^r that it was no better than an imposition which Odd 
bad upon her and her husband, not to eat ofthat jEair 



fruit .which he had created : that the taste th^of wpuld 
make them immortal like God himself ; and consequentl;y 
as great and powerful as he. Upon which she not only eat 
thereof herself, but made her husband eat also, which 
brought them both under heavenly displeasure. 

Here JFriday expressed a great concern ; Ah, pool 
mans I'* cried he, naughty womans ! naughty devil ! make 

God not love de mans, make mans like devil himself.” 

• Friday, said I, God still loved mankind ; and though the 
devil tempted human nature so far, he would not sulFer him 
to have an absolute power over tlmm. 1 have tohKypu be- 
fore of his tender love to his people, till they like Lutrifer, 
disobeyed his commands and rebelled against him ; and even 
then, how Jesus Christ, his only Son, came to save sinners. 
But still every man that lives in the world is under tempta- 
tion and trial. The Devil has a power, as prince of the 
air, to suggest evil cogitations in our minds, and prompt us 
on to wicked actions, that he might glory in our destruction. 
Whatever evil thoughts we have, proceed from him 5 so that 
God, in this our distress, expects we should apply ourselves 
to him by fervent prayer for speedy redress. He is not like 
JBenamuckeef to let none come near him but Oowalcakee, 
but suft’ers the people, as well as the priests, to offer them- 
selves at his feet, thereby to be delivered from the power 
and temptation of the devil. 

But though at first ray man Friday expressed some con- 
cern at the wickedness of Lucifer, I found it not so easy to 
imprint the right notions of him in his mind, as it was about 
the divine essence of God ^ for there nature' assisted me in 
all my arguments, to show to him plainly the necessity of a 
Great First Cause, an overruling, governing Power j of a 
Secret directing Providence, and of the equity and reason- 
ableness of j|>aying adoration to our Creator ; whereas there 
appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an eyil spirit, 
ot‘ his first beginning, his nature, and, above all, of hisincli- 
nation to evil actions, and his power to tempt us to the like. 
And indeed this unlearned Indian^ by the mere force of na- 
ture, puzzled me with one particular question, more than 
ever i could have expected. 

1 had, it seems, one day, beem talking to him of the om- 
nipotent power of God, and his infinite abhorrence of sin, 
insomuch that the Scriptures styled him n consuming fire to 
all the workers of iniquity j and that it, was in his ^ower. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 105 

whenever irc'pftased^ to destroy all the world in a mottiefit, 
the greater part of which are continually offending him. 

When, with a serious attention, he liad listened a great 
while to what I said, after I had been telling him how the 
devil was God’s enemy in the hearts 'of men, and used all 
his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of Providence, 
and destroy the kingdom of Christ in the world, and so 
forth : Very well, Master,’^ said Fiaday, “ you say God is 
“ so strong, so great, is he not much strong, much mightier 
“ than the naughty devil To be sure Friday, said I, God 
is more wise and stronger than the serpent : he is above the 
devil which makes us pray to him tliat he would tread down 
Satan under his feet, enable us to resist the violent temp- 
tations, and quench his fiery darts. “ Why then,” answered 
Friday quickly, ‘‘ if God, as you say, has much^trong, much 
“ might as the devil, why God dot kilFdevil, make no more 
** tempt, no more do wicked.” 

You may be certain I was strangely surprised at the ques- 
tion of my man’s : and, though an old man, I was but a 
young doctor, and consequently very ill qualified for a ca- 
suist, or a resolver of intricate doubts of religion ; and as it 
required some time for me study for an answer, I pre- 
tended not to hear him, nor to ask him what he said ; but, 
so earnest was he for an answer, as not to forget his question,* 
which he repeated in the very same broken words as above. 
When 1 had recovered myself a little: Friday said I, God 
will at last punish him severely, being reserved for judg- 
ment, and is to he cast into the bottomless pit, to remain in 
tire everlasting. But all this did not satisfy Friday ; for 
returning upon me, he repeated my words, “ RBSERVJS AT 
“ LAST, me no understand ; but, why not kill devil now, 

not kill devil great, great while ago ^ Friday, said I, you 
may as well ask me why God does not kill you and 
when, by our wicked actions, we so much offend his 
Majesty ? He gives us time to repent of our sins, that 
by we may obtain pardon. At these words obtain pariunl, 
Friday mused a great while ; and at last, looking me 
fastly ill the face, " Well, well,'’ said he, ** that’s very well ; 
“ so you, I, devil, all wicked mans, all preserve, repent, 
•*' God pardon all.” * 

Indeed, here I was run down to the last extremity, when 
it became very evident to me, how mere natural notions 
£ 5 



i06 LTFE AND ADVENTURES 

ijiiHlt jguide reasonable creatures to the knowlldg^of a Deity, 
ftttil to the homage due to the Supreme Being of God j but 
however, nothing but divine revelation can form the know- 
ledge of Jesus Christ, and of a redemption purchased for 
us, of the mediator of the new covenant, and of an inter- 
cessor at the footstool of God’s throne ; and therefore, the 
Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ ; that is, the 
word and spirit of God, promised for^the guide and sancti- 
fier of his people, are his most necessary instructers of the 
souls of men, in the saving knowledge of the Almighty, and 
the means to attain eternal happiness. 

And now I found it necessary to put an end to this dis- 
course between my man and me j for which purpose I rose 
up hastily, and made as if I had some occasion to go out, 
sending Friday for something that was a good way off. I 
tlien fell on my knees, and beseeched God that he would 
inspire me so far as to guide this poor savage in the know- 
lege of Christ, to answer his questions more clearly, that his 
conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened, and his 
soul saved. When he returned again, I entered into a very 
long discourse with him, upon the subject of the world’s 
redemption by the Saviour of it, and the doctrine of repent- 
ance preached from Heaven, together with an holy faith of 
our blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ; and then 1 proceeded 
to explain to him, according to my weak capacity, the rea- 
son why our Saviour took not on him the nature of angels, 
but rather the seed of Abraham ; and how the fallen angels 
had no benefit by that redemption j and lastly, that he came 
only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like. — 
God knows I had more sincerity than knowledge in all the 
ways I took fpr the p(jor Indian’s instruction 3 and I must 
acknowledge what I bmieve every body that acts upon the 
same principle will find, that in laying heavenly truths open 
before him, I informed and instructed myself in many things 
that either I did not know, or had not perfectly considered 
before ; so that, however, this poor creature might be im- 
l^roved by my instructions, certain it is, that I myself had 
great reason to be thankful to Providence for sending him 
TO me. His company allayed my grief, and made my habi- 
• tation comfortable 5 and when P reflected that the solitary 
life to which I had been so long confined, had made me to 
look further towards Heaven, by making me the instrument, 
under Providence, to save the life, and for ought I know.

the soul of this poor savage, by bringing him to the know*> 
ledge of Jesus Christ, it caused a secret joy to •spread through 
every part of my soul ; and I frequently rejoiced, that ever 
1 was brought to this place, which 1 once thought the most 
miserable part of the world. 

In this thankful frame of mind did 1 afterwards continue 
while I abode on the island, and for three years did my man 
and I live in the greatest enjoyment of happiness. Indeed, 
1 believe the savage was as good a Christian as 1 ; and I 
hope we were equally penitent; and such penitents as were 
comforted and restored by God's Holy Spirit : for now we 
had the word of the Lord, to instruct us in the right way, as 
much as if we had been on the English shore. 

By the constant application,! made to the Scriptures, as 
I read them to my man Friday, I earnestly endeavoured to 
make him understand every part of it, as much as lay in my 
power. He also, on the other hand, by his very serious 
questions and inquiries, made me a much better proficient 
in Scripture knowledge, than 1 should have been by my 
own private reading and study. I must not omit another 
thing, proceeding from the experience 1 had in my retire- 
ment : It was that infinite and inexpressible blessing, the 
knowledge of God through Jesus Christ, which was so plain 
and easy to be understood, as immediately to direct me to 
carry on the great work of sincere repentance for my sins, 
and layiug hold of a Saviour for eternal life, to a practical 
stated reformation, and obedience to ail God’s institutions^ 
without the assistance of a reverend and orthodox divine ; 
and especially by this same instruction, so to enlighten this 
savage creature, as to make him so good a Christian, as very 
few could exceed him. And there was only this great thing 
wanting, that 1 had no authority to administer the Holy Sa- 
crament, that heavenly participation of Christ’s body amt 
blood ; yet however, we rested ourselves content, that God 
would accept our desires, and according to our faith, have 
mercy upon us. 

But what we wanted one .way, was made up in anotfaery 
and that was universal peace in our little church. We had 
no disputes and wrariglings about the nature and equality of 
the holy, blessed, and undivided Trinity ; no niceties in 
doctrine, or schemes of church government; no sour ov 
morose dissenters to impose more sublimate’d notions 
us ; no pedant sophisters to confound us with uninteUigibll

iaysterie» : but instead of all this, we enjoyed the most cent 
tain guide to Heaven ; that is, the word of God ; besklea 
which, we had the comfortable views of his Spirit leading 
us to the truth, and making us both willing and obedient to 
tjie instruction of his word. As the knowledge and prac- 
tice of this are the principal means of salvation, t cannot see 
what it avails any Christian church, or man in the world, to 
amuse himself with speculations and o.piuions, except it be 
to display their particular vanity and affectation. 

You may well suppose, that by the frequent discourse we 
had together, my man and I became most intimately ac- 
quainted, and that there was but very little that 1 could say 
but what Friday understood 3 and indeed, he spoke very 
fluently, though it was but broken English. I now took a 
particular pleasure in relating all my adventures, especially 
those that occurred since my being cast on this island. 1 
made him understand that wonderlul mystery, as he con- 
ceived, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to 
shoot, I also presented to him a knife, which pleased him 
exceedingly, making him a belt, with a frog hanging there- 
to, like those in which we wear hangers in England 3 and, 
instead of a hanger to put in the frog, 1 gave him a hatchet, 
which was uot only as good, but even a better weapon upon 
many occasions. In a word, my man thus accoutred, look- 
ed upon himself as great as Don Quixote, when that cele- 
brated champion went to combat the windmill, 

I next gave him a very particular description of the ter- 
ritories of Europe, and in a particular manner of Old Eng- 
land, the place of my nativity. 1 laid before liim the man- 
ner of our worshipping God, our behaviour one to another, 
and how we trade in ships to every part of the universe. — 
1 tlieu told him my misfortunes in being shipwrecked, show- 
ing, as near as I could, the place where the ship lay, which 
had been gone long before 3 but 1 brought him to the ruins 
of my boat, which before my whole strength could not move, 
but now was almost rotten and fallen to pieces. 1 observed 
l?ay man Friday to view this boat with an uncommon curi- 
osity; which when he had done, he stood pondering a 
great while, and said nothing. At last, said 1 , Friday, .what 
makes you ponder so much ? IJe replied, “ O master, me 
see iilLe boat come to place at my nation.” 

it was some time indeed, before 1 understood wbat my 
man meant 1 but examining strictly into it, 1 plainly found, 



OF ROBINSON* CRUSOE. 


109 


that such another boat resembling mine, had oome upon the 
country where he dwelt ; that is to say, by his iattfaer explana- 
tion, that the boat was driven there through stress of weather. 
It then came into my mind that some European ship having 
been cast away, the poor distressed creatures were forced to 
have recourse to the boat to save their lives ; and being all, 
as 1 thought, drowned, I never concerned myself to ask any 
thing concerning tli^m, but niy only inquiry was about the 
boat, and what description my man could give of it. 

Indeed, Friday answered my demands very well, making 
"every thing very plain to my understanding ; but beyond 
measure was 1 satisfied, when he told me witli great warmth 
and ardour, “ O master, we save white mans from drown T 
upon which I immediately asked him, if there were any 
white mans, as he called them, in the boat ? Yes, yes,” 
said he, “ the boat full, very full of white mans.” How 
many, Friday '? said I. Hereupon he numbered his fingers, 
and counted seventeen. And when I asked him what be- 
came of them all, and whether they lived or not ? he replied 
“ Yes, master, they all live, they be live among my nation/' 
This iAformation put fresh thoughts into my head, tlrat these 
must be those very men who before 1 concluded had been 
swallowed up in the ocean, after they had left the ship, that 
had struck upon the rocks of iny kingdom, and after escap- 
ing the fury of the deep, landed upon the wild shore, and 
committed themselves to the fury of the devouring Indians. 

The manner of their cruelties to one another, which con- 
sequently as I thought, must be acted witli great barbarity 
to strangers, created in me a great anxiety, and made me 
still more curious to ask Friday concerning them. He told 
me, he was sure they still lived there, having resided among 
them above four years, and that the savages gave them vic- 
tuals to live upon •, But pray, Friday, said 1, whence pro- 
ceeded all this good nature and generosity ? How came it 
to pass that they did not kill and eat them, to please their 
devouring appetites, and occasion so splendid an entertain- 
ment among them ? “ No, no,” said Friday, they not kill 
’em, they make brothers with ’em by whicli 1 understood 
there was a truce between them. And then 1 had a ibore 
favourable opinion of the Indians, upon Friday uttering 
these words : “ My nation, t’other nation no eat mans, but 
when mans make war fight;” as though he had said ^ that 
neither those of his kingdom, nor any othfr nations that he 



110 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

knew of, ever eat their fellow creatures, but such as their 
law of arms allowed to be devoured ; that is those misera- 
ble captives, whose misfortune it should be to be made pri- 
soners of war. 

Some considerable time after, upon a very pleasant day, 
in most serene weather, my man and I stood upon the top 
of a hill, on the east side of the island, whence 1 had once 
before beheld the continent of America. I could not tell im- 
mediately what was the matter ; for suddenly Friday fell a 
jumping and dancing as if he had been mad ; and upon my 
demanding the reason of his behaviour, ‘‘ O joy,’' said he, 
“ O glad ! there see my country, there my nation, there live 
white mans gether.’' And indeed such a rapturous sense of 
pleasure appeared in his countenance, that his eyes had an 
uncommon sparkling and brightness, and such a strange 
eagerness, as if he had a longing desire to be in his country 
again. This made me not so well satisfied with my man 
Friday as before ; for by this appearance 1 made no dispute, 
but that if he could get back thither again, he would not 
only he unmindful of what religion I had taught him, but 
likewise of the great obligation he owed me for his v^onder- 
ful deliverance ; nay, that he would not only inform his 
countrymen of me, but accompany hundreds of them to my 
Itingdom, and make me a miserable sacrifice, like those un- 
happy wretches taken in battle. 

Indeed T was very much to blame to have these cruel and 
unjust suspicions, and must freely own 1 wronged the poor 
creature very much, who was of a quiet contrary temper. 

And had he had that discerning acuteness which many Eu- 
ropeans have, he would certainly have perceived my cold- 
ness and indifference, and also have been very much con- 
cerned upon that account : as 1 was now more circumspect, 
1 had much lessened my kindness and familiarity with him, 
and while this jealousy eontinued, I used that artful way 
(now too much in fashion, the occasion of strife and dissen- 
sion) of pumping him daily, thereby to discover whether he 
was deceitful in bis thoughts and inclinations ; but certainly 
he had nothing in him but what was consistent with the best 
principles, both as a religious Christian and a grateful friend ; 
and, indeed, I found every thing hp said was ingeneous ami 
inqot^nt, that 1 had no room for suspicion, and in spite of 
all un^siness, he not only made me entirely his own again, 
but also caused me mnch to lament that I ^ver conceived 
one ill thought of him.

As we were walking up the same hill another day, when 
the weather was so hazy at sea, that 1 could not perceive 
the continent, Friday, said 1, don^t you wish yourself to be 
in your own country, your nation, among your old friends 
and acquaintances? “ Yes,"' saith he, “ me much O glad to 
be at my own nation/' And what would you do there, 
Friday ? Would you turn wild again, eat man's flesh, and 
be as savage as you .were formerly ? “ No, no," (answered 
he, full of concern, and shaking his head) “ Friday now tell 
them to live good, tell them pray God, tell them to eat corn, 
bread, cattle, -41esh, milk, no eat man again." But surely, 
replied I, if you should ofter to do all this, they w ill kill 
you ; and to manifest their contempt of such instruction 
eat you up when they have done. He then put on a grave, 
yet innocent and smooth countenance, saying, “ No, they 
no kill me, they willing love learn that is, that they 
would be very willing to learn : adding withal, “ that they 
had learned much of the bearded mans that came in the 
boat/' Will you, said 1, go back again, Friday? He smil- 
ed at that, and told me, that he could not swim so far. But, 
said I, I will make a canoe for you. Yes, master," said 
he, me go if you go; me no go, if you stay.” 1 go, Fri- 
day ! why would you have them to eat me up, and devour 
your kind master? “ No, no,"' said he, “ me make them not 
eat master, and me make them much love } 0 u;” that is, he 
would tell them how 1 had slain his enemies, and thereby 
saved his life, for which reason he would make them love 
me ; and then he related to me, as well as he was able, how 
exceedingly kind those of his nation were to the white, or 
bearded men, as he called them, who, in their great calami- 
ty, were driven into their country. 

It was from this time, indeed, Thad strong inclinations to 
venture over, and use my utmost efforts, if possible to join 
these white bearded men, who undoubtedly were Spaniards 
or Portuguese ; for, thought I, it must certaiwly be a better 
and safer way to escape wiien there is a good company, than 
for me alone, from an island forty miles ofl:' the shore, and 
without any assistance. Some days after, Friday and I be- 
ing at work, as usual, at the same time diverting ourselves 
with various discourses, 1 •told him I bad a boat which I 
would bestow upon him, whenever he plestsed to return to 
hfs own nation ; and to convince him of the truth of what I 
said, I took him with me to the other side of the island, where 



il2 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

my frigate lay^.aiid then taking it from under the water, (for 
I always kept it sunk for fear of a discovery,,) we went both 
into it to see how it would manage on such a expedition. 

And really never could any one be more dexterous in rowing 
dian my faithful servant, making the boat go as fast again as 
1 could. Well now, Friday, said I, shall we now go to 
your so much admired nation ? But instead of meeting with 
that cheerfulness I expected, he looked very dull and me- 
lancholy at my saying so • which indeed at first surprised me, 
till he made me sensible that his concern was about the 
boat being too small to go so far a voyage. Upon which 
1 let him understand 1 had much bigger j and, accordingly, 
the next day went to the place where the first boat lay, 
which I had made, when all the strength I had, or art I 
could use, failed me in my attempt to get it into the water : 
but now it having lain in the sun two and twenty years, 
and no care being taken of it all that while, it became in a 
manner rotten. My man told me, that such a boat would 
do very well for that purpose sufficient to carry enough vit” 
tie, drink, bread, for that was his manner of talking. In 
short, my mind being strongly fixed upon my designs of go- 
ing over with him to the Continent, 1 very plainly told him 
that we would both go and make a boat full as big, and 
more proportionable than that, wherein he might safely re- 
turn to his own nation* 

These words made Friday look so very pensive, that I 
theught he would have falien at my feet. It was some time 
before he could speak a word, which made me ask him what 
was the matter with him ? He replied, in a very soft and 
moving tone, “ What has poor Friday done ? why are you 
angry, mad with poor servant W hat me done, 0 what me 
doire V Friday, said I, you never yet have offended me, 
what makes you think I am angry with you, when I am not 
angry at all. You no angry, no angry,’' said he, several 
times; ** if you be no angry, why den send Friday over 
great water to my own nation T Why surely, Friday answer- 
ed I, did not you wijsh to be there, when from a mountain 
you beheld the place where you was born ; and is it not 
to satisfy your desires that 1 am w illing to give you leave 
to return thither^ ** Yes, yes,” ^aid Friday, me wish to 
be^ thiere, sure enough, but tlien me wish master there too : 
no wish Friday there, no master there.'* In short, fie could 
not endure liie thoughts of going there without me. I go

there ! Friday, said I, what should 1 do there ? He answered 
very quickly, “ O master, you do great deal much good, you 
teach all de wild mans to be good tame mans : you learn 
dem to be sober, live good life, to know God, and pray 
God/' Alas ! poor Friday, said I, what can i do against 
their priests of BenamucKee, or indeed what good can f 
make your nation sensible of, when I myself am but a poor 
ignorant man ? “ No, po, master,” said he, “ you be no ig- 
norant, you teachee me good, you teachee dem good.” You 
shall go without me, Friday, said I, for I don’t care to ac- 
company you thither 5 I would rather live in this solitude 
than venture among such inhuman savages. Go your way, 
since you desire it, and leave me alone by myself, as 1 was 
before I saved your life. 

Never was any creature more thunderstruck than Friday 
was at these words. ** Go me away, leave master away, 
said he, after a long silence, ‘'no, no, Friday die, Friday live 
not master gone,” as though he had said, 1 neither can nor 
will live, if my master sends me from him. And here 1 can- 
not but take notice of the strong ties of friendship, which 
many times surpass those of consanguinity : For often we 
find a great disagreement among kindred ; and when there 
is any seeming regard for each other, it is very seldom true, 
and scarce ever lasting, if powerful interest does not bear 
the sway ; and that alone is often the occasion of the great- 
est hatred in the wofld, which is to desire the death of pa- 
rents and relations, for the sake of acquiring their forttrnesi 
But there was no such thing between my servant and me ; 
instead of which there was the greatest gratitude and the 
most sincere love ; he found me not only his deliverer, hut 
his preserver and comforter ; not a severe and cruel tyrant, 
but a kind, loving, and affable frienc^. He wanted for no 
manner of sustenance ; and when he was ill or out of order, 
I w'as his physician,' not only for his body but his soul j end 
therefore no wonder was it, that such an innocent creature, 
long since divested of his former natural cruelty, should have 
an uncommon concern at so cruel a separation from me, 
which pierced him to the very soul, and made him desire 
even to die, rather than live without me. 

After! had told Friday m a very careless manner, that 
he should he at liberty as soon as the boat was made, the 
language of his eyes expressed all imagihable confusion; 
when, immediately running to one of bis hatchets, which he* 



114 


LIFE AND ADVENTURES 


used to wear as a defensive weapon, lie gives it into my 
hand, with a heart so full, that he could scarcely speak, — 
Friday, said I, what is it you mean? What must I do with 
tliis ? ** Only kill Friday,” said he, “ Friday care not live 
long.” “ But what must i kill you for?” replied 1 again. 

Ah ! dear master, what made you Friday save from eat a 
me up, so keep long Friday, make Friday love God, and 
love not Benainuckee, and now Friday send away : never 
see Friday more.” As though the poor creature had said, 
Alas ! my dearest kind master, how comes it to pass, that 
after having ventured your precious life to save me from the 
jaws of devouring cannibals, like myself, after such a tender 
regard to provide for me such comfortable nourishment, 
and continuing so long a kind master, and a most sincere 
friend ; and after making me forsake the false notion of an 
Indian deity, and worship the true God in spirit and in 
ti’uth;^and after all this, how comes it now, that you are 
willing to send me away to my former course of living, by 
which means undoubtedly we shall be dead to each other ; 
but greater must be my misfortune, that 1 shall nev(?r behold 
my best friend 1 have in the world any more. And this un- 
doubtedly, though he could not express himself so clearly, 
must be his sentiments ; for the tears ran down his cheeks 
in such a plentiful manner, that 1 had much ado to refrain from 
weeping also, when I beheld the poor creature’s affection ; 
ao that I was forced io comfort him in the best manner I 
, could, which I did by telling him, if he was contcut to abide 
with me, 1 should be ever willing to keep him. 

After Friday’s grief was somewhat abated, more fully to 
convince me of his affection, be said, ** O master, me not 
care to be in my nation, leave you here : Me desire nation 
learn good, that’s all meaning, that his desire was for the 
conversion of that barbarous people. But as 1 had no apos- 
tolic mission, nor any concern about their salvation, so I 
had not the least intention or desire ol undertaking it j and 
the strength of my inclination, in order to escape, proceed- 
ed chiefly from my late discourse with Friday, about th^ 
seventeen white bearded men, that had been driven ufioii 
the barbarian coast, whom 1 designed to join is the only 
means to further our escape. To which intent fay man 
and I went to search for a proper tree to fell, whereof are 
might make a large perigua or canoe, to undertake* the 
age indeed, we were not long in finding one fit m 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 116 

our purpose, there being enough wood in the island to have 
built a rieet of large vessels ; but the thing we principally 
wanted, was to get one so near the water, that we might 
launch it alter it was hnished, and not coinmit so horrid a 
mistake as 1 iiad done once before. 

Well, after a great search for what was best and most 
convenient, Friday, at last, whose judgment in such aftairs 
was much superior to mine, pilclies upon a kind of , wood 
the mot titling for it.* To this day I cannot tell the liaroe 
of the tree, nor (le^cribe it any other way, than only by say- 
ing, that It is very mucii like what we call /?^>s7/r, or hetw'cen 
that and the Niacaragua wood, being much of the same co- 
lour and smell. Bui though my man exceeded me in his 
knowledge of tlic most proper tree, yet 1 show'ed him a much 
better and clearer way to make a canoe than ever he knew 
before ; Ibr he was for burning the hollow or cavity of the 
tree, in order to make this boat ; but 1 then told liim how lie 
might do it with tools, learning him at the same time how to 
use tlu 111 , which indeed he did very dexterously j so that iu 
a mouth’s time we linished it, making it very liandsomc by 
cutting tlAt outside in the true shape of a boat. After this 
it took us a full I'ortnight before we could get her into the 
water, which we did as it were inch by inch, upon great rol- 
lers ; but wlieu she was in, she would have carried twenty 
men, with all the ease imaginable. 

As 1 was very well pleased, you may be sure, at the 
launching of this man of war of mine, 1 w^as no less amazed 
to behold with what dexterity my man would manage her, 
turn iicr, and paddle her along. Weil, Friday, said 1, what 
do you think of it now? Do you think this will carry us 
over < “ Ves, master,” said lie, “ me venture over well, 
though great blow wind.” But my design was yet far- 
ther, which he was insensible of ; and that was to make a 
mast and a sail, and to provide her with an anchor aud 
cable. As to a mast, that was no dithcult thing at all to 
procure: so 1 fixed upon a straight young cedar-tree, which 
I found near the place, great plenty of it abounding in the 
island ; and setting Friday to cut it down, 1 gave him par- 
ticular directions how to shape and order it j but as to the 
sail, fhat I managed myself. ^ I very well knew I had some 
old ones, or pieces of sails enough, which had lain six and 
twenty years by me j but not being careful to preserve them, 
as thinking 1 should have no occasion to use them any more, 



116 


LIFE AND ADVENTURES 


when 1 came to overlook them» 1 found them almost all 
rotten except two ; and with these 1 went to work, and 
after a great deal of pains and awkward tedious stitching 
for want of needles, at length 1 finished a three cornered 
ugly thing, like what we call in England a shoulder of mut- 
ton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little small sprit 
at the top, Like those which our long-boats use, and which 
I very well knew l\ow to manage, especially since it was 
like that which 1 had in my patrod's fishing boat, when, 
with my boy Xury, 1 made my escape from the barbarian 
shore. 

It was near two months, 1 think, before I completed this 
work, that is, the rigging and fitting my masts and sails ; 
and indeed they were nicely done, having made a small stay 
and a sail or a foresail to it, to assist, if we should turn to 
the westward; and, what is still more, 1 fixed a rudder to 
the stern of her, to steer with ; and though 1 was but a very 
indidferent shipwright, yet, as I was sensible of the great 
usefulness and absolute necessity of a thing like this, 1 ap- 
plied myself to it with such constant application, that 1 at 
last accomplished my design ; but what with the many dull 
contrivances 1 had about it, and the failure of many things, 
it cost me as much pains in ordering as in making the boat. 
Besides, when all this was done, 1 had niy man to teach 
what belonged to its navigation ; for though he very well 
understood how to paddle a cauoe along, he was an utter 
stranger to a sail aud a rudder, and was amazed when he 
saw me work the boat to and again in the sea, by them, and 
how the sail gibbed and filled this way or that way, as the 
course we sailed changed. Alter some time and a little use, 
1 made all these things very ^miliar to him so that he be- 
came an expert sailor, except iii relation to the compass, and 
that I could make him understand but little of. But as ft 
happened, there was seldom occasion for it, there being but 
little cloudy weather, and scarce any fog in those parts ; the 
stars w ere always visible in, the night, and the shore perspi- 
cuous by day, except in the rainy season, which confined 
every one to his habitation. Thus entered in the seven and 
twentietli year of my reign, or captivity, which you please, 
(the last three of which, blessed with the company of my 
man Friday, ought not to be reckoned,) I kept the anniver- 
sary of my landing here, with the same thankfulness to God, 
lor his tender mercies, as 1 did before ; and certainly as 1 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 117 

had great cause for a thankful acknowledgment for my dc*- 
livcrance at tirst, 1 had a much j^reater now for such singu*- 
lar ami additional testimonies of the care of Providence ovor 
me, in all my distresses of, both body and mind, and the 
great hopes 1 had of being eftectually and speedily deliver- 
ed ; for 1 bad a strong impression upon my mind, that I 
should not be aiKither year in this island. But however, 1 
still continued on with my husbandry, digging, planting, and 
fencing, as usual ; gathering and curing my grapes, and do- 
ing all other things that were necessary. 

And now the rainy season beginning to come on, obliged^ 
me to keep the longer within doors ; but before ibis, 1 brought 
ray new vessel into the creek, where 1 had landed ray rafts 
from the ship, and hading her up to the shore, I ordered my 
mail Friday to dig a dock siifKcient to hold her in, and deep 
enough to give her water, wherein she might float j and then 
w hen the tide was out, we made a strong darn across the end 
of it, to kcej) out the water ; by which means she lay dry, 
as to the tide from the sea ; and to keep the rain from her, 
we thatched her over at it were, with boughs of trees, like 
a house, so we waited for the months of November and De- 
cember, in which 1 designed to venture over the ocean. 

No sooner did the seasonable weather begin to draw 
near, but so much was 1 elevated with this new designed 
adventure, that I daily prepared for the voyage. The first 
thing I thought on was, to lay by a certain quantity of pro- 
visions, as a sufficient store for such an expedition, intend- 
ing in a week or fortnight’s time to open the dock, and to 
launch out the boat for that purpose. But one morning as 
1 was very busy upon something necessary for this occasion, 
1 called Friday to me, ami bid him go to the sea-shore, and 
see if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a thing which we 
commonly had once a week, as much upon account of the 
eggs, as for the sake of the flesh. He hatl not been long 
gone, but he came running back, as though lie was pursued 
for life, and, as it were, flew over my outer wall, or fence, 
like one that felt not the ground, or had steps to set lihi feet 
on, and before 1 bad time to inquire the reason of his preci- 
pitation, he cries out, “ O dear master, O sorrow, O sorrow ! 
Bad I O bad !” Why what> the matter, Friday, said I. 
“ O yopder, yonder !" said he, “ there be one, two, or tinree 
canoes ! two three !’' Surely thought 1, there roust be ntt, 
by my man's way of leckoaing ; bat on a stricter rnqnify, 



IIB , LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

1 found there were but three. Well, Friday, said T, don’t 
be terrified, I warrant you we will not only defend our- 
selves against them, but kill the most of these cruel savages. 
But though I comforted him in the best manner I could, 
the poor creature trembled so, that I scarce knew what to 
do with him : O master,” said he, they come look Fri- 
day, cut pieces Friday, cut a me up.” Why, Friday, said 
I, they will eat me up as well as you, and my danger is as 
great as yours. But since it is so, we must resolve to fight 
for our lives. What say you? Can you fight, Friday? “ Yes,'’ 
said he, very faintly, “ me shoot, me kill what I can^ but 
there come a great many number.’* That’s no matter, said 
I again, our guns will terrify those we do not kill ; I am 
very willing to stand by you to the last drop of my blood. 
Now tell me if you will do the like by me, and obey my or- 
ders in whatsoever I command? Friday then answered, “ O 
roaster, me lose life Fr* you, me die when you bid die/' 
Thus concluding all questions concerning his fidelity, imme- 
diately I fetched him a good dram of rum, (of which I had 
been a very good husband,) and gave it him to comfort his 
heart. After he had drank it, 1 ordered him to take the two 
fowling-pieces, which we always carried, and loaded them 
with large swan shot, as big as small pistol bullets ; then I 
took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs and 
five small bullets each, charging my two pistols each with a 
braces I hung my great sw'ord, as customary, naked to my 
side, and gave Friday his hatchet, as a most excellent wea- 
pon for defence. 

Thus prepared, I thought as well of myself as any knight- 
erra lit that ever handled a sword and spear. 1 took my per- 
spective glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to see 
what 1 could discover; and I perceived very soon, by my 
glass, that there were one and tw'enty savages, three prison- 
ers, and three canoes, and that their chief concern seeiaed 
to be the triumphant banquet upon the three poor human bo- 
dies, a thing which by this time I had obsened was -very 
corotnon with them. I also remarked, that they did niOt 
land at that place from whence Friday made his escape, btft 
nearer to the creek, where the shore was low, and where a 
libtok wood came verv close tp the sea. My sou! rogs then 
fimd with mdignation and abhorrence at such roiniroan 
wvetebes, which put a period to all my former in 

fteir vindication, neither would 1 myself time' tm

sider their right of conquest, as I bad done before : but de» 
scending from the mountain, i came down to Friday, and 
told him I was resolved to go speedily to them, and kill 
them all ; asking him again, in the same breath, if he would 
stand by me : when by this time being recovered from his 
fright, and his spirits mucfi cheered with the dram I bad 
given him, he was very pleasant, ^et seriously telling me, 
as he did before, “ When 1 bid die, he would die.’" 

And now it was, iiaving tixed my resolution in so strong 
a manner, that nothing could divest my breast of its uncom* 
moil fury, I immediately divided the loaded arms betwixt ua. 
To iny man Friday, 1 gave a pistol to stick in his girdle, 
with lliree guns upon his shoulder, a weight too great 1 con- 
fess to bear ^ but w hat must a poor king do, who had but 
one soldier in tlie world ? But to show 1 made him bear no 
more than wliat 1 would lay on myself, 1 stuck the other pis- 
tol ill my girdle, and the other three guns upon my shoul- 
ders ; nay, something more, but that was like i^sop’s biirdeD* 
a small bottle of rum, winch was soon lightened to ourcat- 
ceoding refreshment. Thus we marched out, under a'pon- 
deroua load of armour, like two invincible cbainpions, with a 
quantity of powder and bullets to stand our battle, and load 
again wlieirthe pieces were discharged. And now my or- 
ders being to be obeyed, J charged Friday to keep close be- 
hind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or attempt any thing till 
1 commanded him ; and in the interim, not to speak so much 
as one word. It was in this order 1 fetched a compass to 
the right hand, of near a mile, as well to get over the creek#, 
as to attain the wood j and by this 1 thought to come with- 
in shot of them before 1 could be desceriied, as I found, by 
my glass, would not be dilhcult to accomplish. 

But how fickle and wavering is the mind ui men, even in 
our greatest fury and strongest iiicLinations ! Fur wliile 1 was 
tailing this niarcii, my resolution began to abate, not through 
fear of their numbers, who were a parcel of naked unarmed 
wretches, but those rejections occurred to mw thoughts: 
what power was i commissioned with, or wbat occasion or 
necessity had 1 to go and imbrue my bands in human blood, 
and murder {leopie that had neither done, nor intended to 
do me any wrong i They w^re innocent in particular as to 
me ; and their barbarous custom was not only their miafif- 
time, but a sign that God had left them in the most immeaae 
stupidity ; but yet did not warrant me to be a judge of ibtk

kowmir, he killed two, and mortally wounded a third. In 
Ihe iBoan time, f cut the dags that tied the hands and feet 
of the poor creature, and lifting him up, asked him in the 
Portuguese tongue. What he wa$? He answered me in Latin, 
Christianus; but so very weak and faint, that he could scarce 
stand or speak. Immediately 1 gave him, a dram and a 
piece of bread to cherish him, and asked him what country- 
man he was ^ He said Hispaniola, and then uttered all the 
thankfuinest imaginable for his deliverance. Seignior, said I, 
with as much Spanish as I was master of, let us talk after- 
wards, but fight now ; here take this sword and pistol, and 
do what yon can. And, indeed, he did so with such cou- 
rage and intrepidity, that lie cut two of them in pieces in 
an instant, the savages not having the power to fly for their 
lives. 1 ordered Friday to run for those pieces we had left 
at the tree, which he brought me with great swiftness, and 
then I gave him my musket, while I loaded the rest. But 
now there happened a fierce encounter between the Spani- 
ard and one of the savages who had made at him with one of 
wooden swords j and though the former was as brave 
as could be expected, having twice wounded his. enemy in 
the head, yet being weak and faint, the Indian had thrown 
him upon the ground, and was wresting my sword out of his 
hands, which the Spaniard very wisely quitting, drew out 
his pistol and shot him through the body before 1 could come 
near him, though I was running to his assistance. As for Fri- 
day, he pursued the flying wretches with his hatchet, dispatch- 
ing tkree, but the rest were too nimble for him. The Spani- 
ard taking one of the fowling-pieces, wounded two, who run- 
ning into the wood, Friday pursued and killed ; but the other, 
notwithstanding his wounds, plunged himself into the sea, 
and swam to those who were left in the canoe, which, with 
one wounded, were all that escaped out of one and twenty. 
The account is as follows.

The savages in tlie canoe worked very hai^ |fet CMit 
of our reach, and Friday was as eager in purauing them ; 
and indeed I was no less anxious about their eaeapej le»t, 
after the news had l)een carried to their people, they shottid 
return in multitudes and destroy us. So being resolved to 
pursue them, I jumped into one of their canoes, and bid 
Friday follow me; but no sooner was I in, than, to my sur- 
prise, I found another poor creature bound hand and foot 
for the slaughter, just*as the Spaniard had been, with very 
little life in him. Immediately I unbound him, and would 
have helped him up, l)ut he could neither stand nor speak, 
but groaned so piteously, as thinking he was only iinbouitd 
in order to be slain. Hereupon I bid Friday speak to hhn, 
and tell him of his tleliveraiice j when pulling out my 
bottle, I made the poor wretch drink a dram, which, with 
the joyful news he had received, so revived his heart, that 
he sat up in the boat. As ^oon as Friday began to hear him 
speak, and look more /ully in his face, it would have moved 
any one to tears to perceive his uncommon transports of 
joy ; for he ki.ssed, embraced him, hugged him, cried, 
laughed, "hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung, then cried 
again, wrung his hands, beat his fticc and head, then sung 
and jumped about again, like a distracted creature ^ so that 
it was a great while before I could make him speak to me, 
or tell me what wak the matter with him ; but when he 
came to the liberty of his speech, at the last he told me if 
was his father. 

Here indeed I was infinitely moved to see that dutiful 
and tender affection this poor savage had to his aged parent. 
He would sit dow n by him in the boat, open his breast, and 
hold his father’s head close to his bosom, half an hour toge- 
ther, to cherish him : then he took his arms and ancles, 
which were stiff and numbed with binding, and chafed and 
rubbed them with his hands ; by which means, perceiving 
what the case was, 1 gave him some rum, which proved of 
great beneht to him. 

While we were bu.Hy in this action, the savages had got- 
ten almost out of sight ; aud happy it was we aid hot put: 
sue them : For there arose from the north-west, whic(i Con- 
tinued all night long, such a violent storm, that 1 could" not 
sujf^se otherwise but tbatnbev were all drowned. Aflnr 
this I called Fridav to me, and asked him if he had 
his father any bread ? He shook his head and said,

not one bit, me eat a up ail so I gave him a cake of bread 
out of a little pouch I carried for this end. I likewise gave 
him a dram for himself, and two or three bunches of raisins 
for his father. Both these he carried to him, for he would 
m^ke him drink the dram to comfort him. 

Away then he runs out of the boat as if he was bewitched, 
with such an extraordinary swiftness, that he was out of 
sight as it were in an instant ; but at his return I perceived 
him slacken his pace, because he had something in his hand. 
And this I found to be, as he approached nearer, an earthen 
jug with some water for his father, with two more cakes of 
bread, which he delivered into my hands. Being very 
thirsty myself, I drunk some of the water, of which when his 
father had drank sufficiently, it more revived his spirits than 
all the rum I had given him. 

I then called Friday to me, and ordered him to carry the 
Spaniard one of the cakes, and some water, who was repos- 
ing himself on a green place under the shade of a tree, but 
so weak, that though he exerted himself, he could not stand 
upon his feet. Upon which I ordered Friday to rub and 
bathe his ancles with rum, as he did his father's. — But every 
minute he was employed in this, he would cast a wishful eye 
tpwards the boat, where he lell his father sitting ; who sud- 
denly disappearing, he Hew like lightning to him, and find- 
ing he had only laid himself down to ease his limbs, he re- 
turned back to me presently, and then I spoke to the Spa- 
niard to let Friday help him, and lead him to the boat, in 
order to be conveyed to my dwelling, where I would take 
care of him. Upon which Friday took him upon his back, 
and so carried him to the caiioc, setting him close by his fa- 
ther ; and presently stepping out again, launched the boat 
off and paddled it along the shore faster than 1 could walk, 
though the wind blew very hard too, and having brought 
them safe to the creek, away he runs to fetch the other ca- 
noe, which he brought to the creek almost as soon as I got 
to it by land, when wafting me over, he took our new guests 
out of the boat ; but so weak were they that I was forced to 
make a kind of a hand-barrow ; and when 1 came to my cas- 
^ tie, not being willing to make an entrance into my wail, we 
made them a handsome tent, covered w ith old, sails, and 
boughs of trees, making two j^ood beds of rice straw, with 
Uaokets to lie upon ai^ cover them. Thus, like an abso- 
lute^ing over subjects who owed their lives to me^ I thought

myself very considerable, especially as I had now three re- 
ligions in niv kingdom, my man Friday being a Protestant, 
his father a'Pagan, and the Spaniard a Papist ; but 1 gave 
liberty of conscience to them all. 

To get provisions for my poor weak stibjects, I ordered 
Friday to kill me a yearling goat ; which when he had done, 

1 cut off the hinder quarters, and chopping it into small 
pieces, boiled and stewed it, putting barley and rice into 
the broth. This I carried into their tent, set stable, dined 
with them myself, and encouraged them. Friday was my 
interpreter to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too, 
who spoke the language of the savages pretty well. After 
dinner I ordered Friday to fetch home all our arms from the 
held of battle, and the next day, to bury the dead bodies, 
which be did accordingly. 

And now 1 made Friday inquire of his father, whether 
he lliougbt these savages bad escaped the late storm in th^ir 
canoe ? and if so, whether they would not return with a 
i>ower too great for us to resibt ^ lie answered, that he 
thought U impossible they could outlive the storm ; or, if 
they were driven southwardly, they would come to a laud 
wliere they would be as certainly devoured, as if they were 
drowned in the sea. And suppose they had attained their 
own country, tiie strangeness of their fatal and bloody at- 
tack, would make them tell their people, that the rest of 
them were killed by thunder and lightning, not by the 
hand of man, but by two heavenly spirits, (meaning Irriday 
and me,) who were sent from above to destroy them. And 
this, lie* said, he knew, because he had beard them say the 
same to one another. And indeed he was in the right on’t ; 
for I have heard since, that these four men gave out that 
whoever went to that enchanted island, would be destroyed 
by lire from the gods. 

No canoes appearing soon after, as 1 expected, my ap*. 
prehensions ceased : Instead of which my former thoughts 
of a voyage took place, especially when Friday’s father as- 
sured me, I should have good Usage in bis nation. As to 
the Spaniard, he told me, that sixUcii more of bis county- 
men and Portuguese, who had been shipwrecked, made 
their escape thither j that plough they were in union with 
the savages, yet they were very miserable for want of pro- 
visions and other necessaries. When i asked him about iho 
particulars of his voyage, be answered that their ship was

bound from Rio de la Plata to the Havannah ; that when the 
ship was lost, .only five men penshed in the ocean ; the rest, 
having saved themselves in the boat, were now landed on 
the main continent. And what do they intend to do there ? 
said I. He replied, they have concerted measures to escape, 
by building a vessel, but they had neither tools^nor provi- 
sions, so that all their designs came to nothing. Suppos- 
ing, said I, 1 should make a proposal, and invite them here, 
would they not carry me prisoner to New Spain ? He an- 
swered no ; for he knew them to be such honest men, as 
would scorn to act such inhuman baseness to their deliverer : 
That, if I pleased, he and the old savage would go over to 
them, talk with them about it, and bring me an answer: 
That they should all swear fidelity to me as their leader, up- 
on the lioly Sacrametit ; and, for his part, he would not 
only do the same, but stand to the last drop of his blood, 
shoiild there be occasion. 

These solemn assurances made me resolve to grant them 
relief, and to send these two over for that purpose ; but 
when every thing was ready, the Spaniard raised an objec- 
tion, which carried a great deal of weight in it : “You 
know, Sir,'’ said he, “ that having been some time with you, 
I cannot but be sensible of your stock of rice and corn, 
sufficient, j^erhaps, for us at present, but not for them, 
^oukl they come over presently, much less to victual a ves- 
sel for an intended voyage. Want might be as great an oc- 
casion for them to disagree and rebel, as the children of Is- 
rael did against God himself, when they wanted bread in 
Ike wilderness. And, therefore, my advice is, to wait ano- 
ther harvest, and in the mean time cultivate and improve 
some more land, whereby we may have plenty of provisions, 
in order to execute our design.” 

This advice of the Spaniard's I approved extremely, and 
so satisfied was I of his fidelity* that I esteemed him ever 
nRer* And thus we all four went to work upon some more 
land* and against seed-time we bad gotten so much cured 
and trimmed up, as was sufficient to sow twenty two bushels 
of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, 
aU the seed we had to spare. As we were four in number, 
md by this time all in good health, we feared not a hun- 
dsdl Indians, should they venture to attack us j and while 
Am coni was growing, I pitched upon some trees, to 
knild us a large vessel, in case the Spaniards ckme over «

which bciog marked, I ordered Friday aud hU fathei to cut 
them down, appointing the Spaniaixl, who was nou^ my 
privy counsellor, to oversee and direct the whole* 1 iike- 
wisc increased iny docks of goals, Uy aiiooting the wild 
dams, and bringing home their kiil«, to jny incloaurc. Nor 
did 1 neglect the gra{>e season, but cured them as usual, 
though I had such a (piantity now, as would have filled 
eighty barrels w ith rasins,. And thus all of us being em» 
ployed, they in working, and I in providing for them, tdl 
harvest came, Ck>d Almighty blessed the increase of it so 
rnucli, that out of twenty-two barrels of barley, we thrashed 
out two hundred and twenty, and the like quantity of rice, 
sufiicicnt to victual a ship fit to carry me and all the Spani- 
ards to any part of America. 

Thus the principle objection being answered by a suffi- 
cient stock of proxisioiis, 1 sent my two ambassadors over 
to the main land, with a regal authority to acfiiiinister the 
oatl»s of allegiance and fidelity, and have an histrumeiit^iga- 
ed under their hands, though I never asked whether they had 
pen, ink, or paper j when giving each of Uicm a musket, 
eight clfarges of powder and ball, and provisions enough for 
eight days, they sailed away with a fair gale, on a day when 
the moon was at full. 

Scarce a fortnight had passed over my head, but impa- 
tient for their return, I laid me down to sleep one morning, 
when a strange accident happened, which was ushered ^in 
by Friday’s coming running to me, and calling aloud, ** Mas- 
ter, master, they are come, they are come.” Upon which, 
not dreaming of auy danger, out I jumped from my bed, put 
on my clothes, and hurri<‘d through my little grove j woft^ 
looking towards the sea, I perceived a boat about a league 
and a half distant, standing in for the shore with the wiml 
fair. 1 beheld they did not come from the side, where the 
land lay on, but from the soiilhermost end of the island : 
So these being none of the people we wanted, I ordered 
Faiday to lie still, till such time as I came down from the 
mountain, which with my ladder 1 now ascended, in order 
to discover more fully what they were ; and now with tlie 
help of my perspective glass, I plainly perceived an 
lisb ship, which I concluded it to be, by the fashion of Wf 
long boat ; and which filled me with such uncommon trana- 
ports of joy that I cannot tell how to describe ; aUli 
acme secret doubts hung about me, proceeding from I Iww 
F 4

not what cause, as though I had reason to be upon my 
guard. And, indeed, I would have no man contemn the 
secret hints aud intimations of danger, which very often are 
given, when we may imagine there is no possibility of its 
being real ; for had I not been warned by ibis silent admo- 
nition, I had been in a worse situation than before, and 
perhaps ine\itably ruined. 

Not long it was, before I perceived the boat to approach 
the shore, as though they looked for a place where they 
might conveniently land ; and at last they ran their boat on 
shore upon the beach, about half a mile’s distance j which 
proved so much the happier for me ; since, had they come 
into the creek, they had landed just at my door, and might 
not only have forced me out of my castle, but plundered me 
of all 1 had in the w orld. Now 1 w as fully convinced they 
were all Englishmen, three of which were unarmed and 
bound ; when immediately the first four or five leaped on 
shore, and took those three out of the boat as prisoners; 
one of whom I could perceive used tlu* most passionate ges- 
tures of entreaty, alttiction, and despair, while the others, in 
a lesser degree, showed abundance of concern. 

Not knowing the meaning of this, 1 was very much as- 
tonished, and I beckoned to Friday, who was below, to as- 
cend the mountain, and likewise to view this sight. O 
master,” said he to me, you see English mans eat prison- 
ers as well as savage mans.” And do you think they will 
eat them, Friday ? said 1, " Yes,'^ said Friday, they eat a 
all up.” No, no, said I, Friday, 1 am much more concern- 
ed lest they murder them, but as for eating them uj), that I 
am sure they will never do. 

And now 1 not only lamented my misfortune in not hav- 
ing the Spaniard and the savage with me, but also that i 
could not come within shot of them unperceit^ed, (they hav- 
ing no fire-arms among them,) and save these three men, 
whom 1 thought they were going to kill with their swords. 
But some comfort it was to me, that I perceived they were 
set at liberty to go where they pleased, the rascaUv seainen 
scattering about as thougli they had a mind to see the ; 
and so long did they negligently ramble; that the tide had 
ebbed so low as to leave the boat aground. Nor wete the 
tw<^ men who were in her more circumspect ; for havihig 
dmnk a little too much liquor, they fell fast asleep y

too fast aground for his strength to move it, he hallooed out 
to the rest, who made aii possible expedition to come to 
him ; but as Providence ordered it, aii their force was ttt'* 
edectuai to launch her, when 1 could heai* them speak to 
one another, “ Why let her alone, Jack, can’t ye, she’ll 
rtoat next tide by which words 1 was fully convinced they 
were ray own countrymen. I all this while lay very quiet, 
as being fully sensible it could be no less than ten hours be- 
fore the boat could be afloat, and then it would be so dark, 
that they could not easily perceive me, by which means 1 
should be more at liberty to hear their talk, and observe all 
iheir motions ; not but that I prepared for my defence; yet 
as 1 had another sort of an enemy to combat with, I* acted 
with more caution. I took two fusees on my shoulder, and 
gave Trulay three muskets j besides my formidable gOHt*skiii 
eoat and monstrous cap made me look as fierce and terrible 
as Hercules of old, especially when two pistols were stuck 
in iny belt, and my naked sword hanging by my side. 

it was my design ut first not to make any attempt till it 
was dark ; and it being now two o’clock, in the very heat of 
tlie day, the sailors were all straggling in the woods, and un- 
doubtedly were lain down to sleep. The three poor distress- 
ed creatures, too anxious to get any repose, were however 
seated under the shade of a great tree, about a quarter of a 
mile from me. Upon which, without any more ado, 1 ap- 
proached towards them, w ith my man following behind me,’ 
and, before 1 was perceived, I called aloud to them in Sjm- 
riish, “ What are ye, Gentlemen V' 

At these words, they started up in great confusion, when 
they beheld the strange figure 1 made ; they returned no 
answer, but seemed as if they would fly from me. Gen- 
tlemen,” said 1, in English, ** don’t be afraid ; perhaps you 
have a friend nearer than you expect.*' “ He must be from 
Heaven,” said one of them, gravely, pulling off h|s hat, “ for 
we are past all help in this world.” “ All help is from 
Heaven,” said I ; “ but. Sir, as 1 have perceived every ac- 
tion between you and these brutes since your landing, only 
itifbroi me how to assist you, and 1 will do it to the utmost 
of my Jjower.”

there they lie, while my heart trembles,, lest having seen 
and heard us, they should murder us all.” “ Have they 
tire arms r said 1. “ They have but two pieces,” said "he, 

** one of wliich is left in tiie boat.” He also told me there 
were t\K) enormous villains among them, that were the au- 
thors of this mutiny, who, if they were killed or seized, 
might induce the rest to reliirn to their obedience. — “ Well,

them as they lay sleeping. The Captain modestly said, that 
he was sorry to kill them ; though, on the other hand, to 
let these villains, escape who were the authors of his misery, 
might be the ruiu of us all. ** Well,” said he, ** do as you

boat, and bring away the oars and saiis ; when, at their re* 
turn, three men coming back, and seeing their late distreated 
Captain now their conqueror, submitted to be bound alio. 
And then it was, that having more liberty, 1 related the ad- 
ventures of my own life, which he heard with a serious 
and wonderful attention. After this, I carried him and hts 
two companions into my little fortiticd castle ; showed them 
all my conveniences, and refreshed them with such provi- 
sions as I could afford. When this was over we began to 
consider about regaining the ship: He said that there were 
twenty-six hands on board, who knowing their lives were 
forfeited by the law for conspiracy and mutiny, were so very 
hardened, that it would be dangerous for our smallxompuny > 
to attack them. Tins was a reasonable inference indeed; 
but something wc must resolve on, and immediately put in 
execution, We theref()re heaved the boat upon the beach 
so high that she could not shoot off at high-watermark, and 
broke a hole in lier not easily to be slopped ; so that ail the 
signals they gave for the boat to come on board were in 
vain. Tiiis obliged them to send another boat ashore, with 
ten merf armed, whose faces the Captain plainly descril»ed, 
the boatswain being the chief othcer ; but he said there 
were three honest lads among them, who were forced 
into the conspiracy, Hereupon 1 gave him fresh courage, 
(for I had perceived he was in concern,) in the mean while 
securing our prisoners except two, whom we took to our 
assistance, we thought ourselves able enough to adventure 
a battle. When the sailors landed, and beheld their boat 
ill that condition, they not only hallooed, but fired for their 
companions to hear, yet they received no answer. This 
struck them with horror and amazement ; and thinking their 
companions were murdered, they made as if they would re- 
turn to the ship. 1 could perceive the Captain’s counte- 
nance change at this, til) of a sudden, three men were or- 
dered to Ipok after the boat, while the other seven leapt on 
shore in order to search for their companions ; and, indeed, 
they ..came to the brow of the hill, near rny ancient castle, 
ffiience they could see to a great distance in the woods, 
and lb fere shouting and hallooing till tired and weary, they, 
4$ idfegth, seated themselves under a spreading tree. My 
was, that nothing t:ould be done till night, wiien I 
Wife some artifice to get them all out of the boat;* but 
• fettdden they started up, and made to tbfe sew»skle :

hereupon I ordered Friday and the Captain’s mate to go 
over the creek, and halloo as loud as they could, and so de- 
coying them into the woods, come round to me again. And 
this, indeed, had good effect ; for they followed the noise, 
till coming westward to the ci:cek, they called for their boat 
to carry them over, and taking one of the men out of her, 
left two to look after her, having fastened her to the stump 
of a little tree on shore. Hereupon immediately the Cap- 
tain and our party passing the cieek,*ont of their sight, we 
surprised them both, by the Captain’s knocking down one 
and ordering the other to surrender upon pain of death, 
and who being the honestest of them all, sincerely joined 
with us. By this time it was pretty late ; when the rest 
returning to their boat, which they found aground in the 
creek, the tide out, and the men gone, they ran about wring- 
ing their hands, crying it was an enchanted island, and that 
they should be all murdered by spirits or devils. My men 
would willingly have fallen upon them, but 1 would not 
agree to hazard any of our party. But to be more certain, 
Friday and the Captain crawled upon their hands and feet, 
as near as possible; and when the boatswain approached 
in sight, so eager was the Captain, that he tired and killed 
him on the spot ; Friday wounded the next man, and a third 
ran away. Hereupon I advanced with my whole army ; 
and it being dark, 1 ordered the man we had surprised in 
the boat, to call them by their names, and lo ])ariey with 
them. Accordingly he called out aloud, “ Tom Smith, 
Tom Smith !” He answered, “ Whose that “ Robinson 
answered the other. “ For God's sake, Tom, surrender 
immediately, or you're all dea<l men.” Who must we 
surrender to V* says Smith. “ To our Captain and hfty men 
here, who have taken me prisoner, wounded Will Fryer, 
and killed the boatswain.” ** Shall we have quarters, 
tlien said he. Hereupon the Captain culls out, You 
Smith, you know my voice, surrender immediately, and 
you shall have all your lives granted, except Will Atkins.” 
Hereupon Atkins cried out, What have I done. Captain, 
more than the rest, who have been as bad as me T But 
that was a lie, for he was the person that laid hold of hioi, 
and bound him. However he was ordered to submit to the 
governor’s mercy, for such was I called. And so, layii^ 
down their arms, we bound them all, and seized on theti 
boat.

After this, the Captain expostulated with them, telling 
them that the governor was an Englishman, who might exe* 
x^ute them here ; but he thought they would all be sent to 
England, except Will Atkins, who was ordered to prepare 
for death the next morning. Hereupon Atkins implored the 
Captain to intercede for his life, and the rest begged they 
might not be sent to England. This answered our project 
for seizing the ship. For after sendtiig Atkins and two of 
the worst fust bound to the cave, and the rest being com- 
mitted to my bower, I sent the Captain to treat with them 
in the governor's name, offering them pardon if they would 
assist in recovering the ship. Upon which they all promis- 
ed to stand by him to the last drop of their blood ; and who- 
ever acted treacherously, should be hanged in chains upon 
the beach. They were all released on these assurances; 
and then the Captain repaired to the other boat, making Ins 
passenger Captain of her, and gave liim four men well arm- 
ed 3 while himself, his mate, and dive more went in the 
other boat. By midnight they canwi within call of the ship, 
when the Captain ordered Robinson to hail her, and tell 
ibcrii that with great dilhculty they had found H)e men at 
last. But while they were discoursing, the Captain, his 
mate, and the rest entered and knocked down the second 
mate and carpenter, secured those that were upon deck, 
by putting them under hatches, wdnle the other boat’s crew 
entered and secured the forecastle ; they then broke into 
tiie round-liouse, w here the male, after some resi-^tance, shot 
the pirate captain liirongh the head, upon which all the rest 
yielded themsei'ves prisoners. And thus the ship being re- 
covered, the jo}ful signal was fired, which I heard with 
the greatest joy imaginable ; nor was it long before he 
brought the ship to an anchor at the creek’s mouth, where 
coming to me unawares, ‘' There," says he, “ niy dearest 
friend and deliverer, there is your ship, and w^e are your ser- 
vants a comfort so unspeakable, as made me swoon in hts 
arms, while, with gratitude to heaven, we were tenderly em- 
biacing each other. 

Nothing now remained,^ hut to Consult what we should 
do with the prisoners, whom be thought it was not safe to 
take on board. Hereupon concerting with the Captain, 1 
dressed myself in one of his luits, and sending for them, told 
them, that I was going to leave the island with all my peo«

pie, if they would tarry there their lives should be spared ; 
if not, they should be hanged at the first port they came at. 
They agreed to stay. Hereupon I told them my whole story, 
charging them to be kind to the Spaniards, that were ex- 
pected, giving them all my arms, and informing them of every 
thing necessary for iheir subsistence, after which, 1 and my 
man Friday went ou board. But the next morning, two of the 
men came swimming to the ship’s side, desiring the Captain 
to take them on board, thougli he hanged them afterwards, 
complaining mightily how barbarously the other used them. 
Upon which I prevailed with the Captain to take them in j 
and being severely whipt and pickled, they proved more 
honest for the future. And so 1 bid farewell to this island, 
carrying along with me my money, my parrot,- umbrella, and 
goat’s-skin cap j setting sail December 12, after twen- 
ty-eight years, two months, and nineteen days residence, 
that same day and month that 1 escaped from Salec, landing 
iu England June il, 1GH7, after five and thirty years ab- 
sence from my own country, which rendered me altogether 
a stranger there. 

Here I found my first Captain’s widow alive, who had 
buried a second husband, bat iu very mean circumstances, 
and whom 1 made easy upon his account. Soon after, 1 
went down to Yorkshire, where all my fapiily was expired, 
except two sisters, and as many of one of my brothers 
children. 1 found no provision had been made for me, 
they concluding 1 had been long since dead ; so that 1 was 
but in a very slender station. Indeed the Oaptain did me 
a great kindness, by his report to the owners, how 1 had 
delivered their ^hip on the Desolate Island, upon w hich they 
made me a present of 2001. sterling. I next went to Lis- 
bon, taking my man Friday with me, and there arriving in 
April, 1 met the Portuguese Captain, who had taken me on 
board on the African coast ; but being ancient, he had left 
off the sea, and resigned alt his business to his sou, who 
followed the Brazil trade. So altered both of us were, that 
we did not know each other at first, till 1 discovered myself 
ttMire fully to him. After a few embraces, 1 began to jn- 
iptireof my concerns; and then the old gentleman 
that it was nine years since he had been at Brazil,

lost, had obliged ray trustee! to give an estimste of my share 
to the procurator fiscal, who in case of my not returning, 
had given one-third to the king, and the rest to the monas* 
tery of St. Augustine ; but if 1 put in iny claim, or any one 
for me, it would be returned, except the yearly product 
which was given to the poor. 1 then desired him to tell me 
what improvement he thought had been made of my planta* 
tion, and whether he imagined it was worth my while to look 
after it ? He answereS he did not know how much it was im- 
proved ; but this he was certain of, that my partner was 
grown vastly rich upon his half of it ; and, that he had been 
informed, that the king had 200 moidores per annum for bis 
third jiart. lie added, that the survivors of my trustees 
were persons of an ingenuous character; that my partner 
could witness my title, my name being registered in the coun- 
try, by w iiich means 1 should indispeosibly recover consider- 
ble sums of money. Hut. answered f, how could iny truf- 
tees dispose of my eficcls, when 1 nia<^e you only my heir'? 
This, he said, was true ; but, there being no affidavit made 
of my <leath, he could not act as my executor. However' 
he had‘ ordered his son, (then at Brazil,) to act by procura- 
tion upon my account, and he had taken possession of my 
sugar-house, having accounted himself for eight years with 
my partner and trustees for the profits, of which be would 
give me a very good account. 

And, indeed, this he performed very faithfully in a few 
days, making himself indebted to me 470 rnoidoros of gold, 
over and above what had been lost at sea, aft^er 1 had 
the place. And then he recounted to me my misfortunes 
he had gone through, which forced rny money out of bii 
hands, to buy a part in a new ship : “ But,” says he, ** you 
shall not want ; take this ; and, when roy son returns, every 
farthing shall be paid you.” Upon which he put into nty 
hands a purse of 150 moidores in gold ; as likewise the t&* 
strument, containing the title to the ship which his sou was 
in, and which he offered as security for the remainder, jBat 
reidly when 1 saw so much goodnes, generosity, tendemess, 
and'f^eai honesty, 1 had not the heart to accept it, for, |ear

effects into my hands, and that I designed to go myself for 
that purpose. But he told me he could save me that trou- 
ble, and so caused me to enter my name with a public nota- 
ry^ as likewise my affidavit with a procuration atiixed to it ; 
and this he ordered me to send in a letter to one of his ac- 
quaintance, a merchant in Brazil ; and, indeed, nothing 
cotdd be more faithfully and honourably observed ; for, in 
seven months time, 1 had a very faitliful account of all iny 
effects, what sums of money were raised, what expended, and 
what remained for my use ; In a word, I found myself to be 
worth 50001. sterling, and lOOOl. per annum. Nor was this 
all j fop my partner congratulated me upon my being alive, 
telling me how much my plantation was improved ; what 
Negroes were at work, and how many Ave Marias he had 
said to tlie Virgin Mary for my preservation, desiring me to 
accept kindly some presents he had sent me, which 1 found 
showed the greatest generosity. 

No sooner did the ship arrive, but I rewarded my faith- 
ful Captain, by returning him the hundred moidores, and 
not only forgave him all he owed me, but I allowed him yearly 
a hundred more, and fifty to his son, during their lives. And 
now being resolved to go to England, I returned letters ot 
thanks to the Prior of St, Augustine, and in particular to rny 
old partner, with very suitable presents. By the Captain’s ad- 
vice, 1 was persuaded to go by land to Calais, and there lake 
passage for England ; when as it happened, I got a young 
English gentleman, a merchant's son at Lisbon, to accom 
pany me, together w'ith two English and two Portuguese gen- 
tlemen ; so that wit ii a Portuguese servant, an English. sai- 
lor, and my man Friday, there were nine of Os in number. 

Thus armed and equipped, we set out, and came to Ma- 
drid, when the summer decaying we hasted to Navarre, 
where we were informed, that there was scarcely any pas- 
sing, by reason of the prodigious quantity of snow' ; so that 
we were obliged to abide near twenty days at Pampeluna, 
and. to take a guide to conduct us safe towards Tiiou- 

lottiei ^Atfcd now twelve other gentlemen joining with us, 
together with their servants, we had a very jolly company, 
Awny oor guide led us by frightful mountains, and through 
sO many intricate mazes and windings, that we insensibly 
ptMed them, which as we traveled along, ushered us into 
the i^ospect of the fruitful and charming provinces of Lon* 
guedon and Gascony. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


ia7 

But now I came on two adventures, both tragical and co- 
mical. First, our guide was encountered hy three wolves 
and a bear, who set upon him and his horse, and wounded 
him in three places ; upon which my man, riding up to his 
assistance, shot one of them dead upon the spot, which 
made the other retire into the woods. But the pleasantest 
adventure was, to behold my man attack the hear. ’Tis 
such a creature that if you let him alone, he will never 
meddle with you ; and this my man very well knew, ajid 
so begging leave of me in broken English, lie told us “ he 
would make good laugh.^’ “ B'hy, you silly fool,’’ said 
1, “ he’ll eat you up at a mouthful,” “ Eeatee me up !*' re- 
plied he, by way of scorn, “ me not only eatee him, but 
make much good laugh.'" Upon which, pulling off his 
boots, he claps on his pumps, and running after the monsti^us 
beast, he called out that he wanted to discourse with 
and then throwing stones on purpose to incense him, 
beast turns about in fury, and with prodigious strides, 
shuffles after him. But though he was not swift enough to 
keep up pace with Friday, who made up to us as it were 
for help ; yet being angry, ** You dog,” said I, “ immedi- 
ately take horse, and let us shoot the But he 

cried, “ Dear master, no shoot, me make you Wtfgh much.” 
And so he turned about, making signs to follow, while the 
bear ran after, till coming to a great oak, he ascended in a 
minute, leaving bis gun at the bottom of it. Nor did the 
bear make any difflculty of it, but ascended like a cat, though 
his weight was very great. You must eonsidcinWas not 
a little amazed at the folly of my man, as not perlWving any 
thing to occasion our laughter, till such time as we rode up 
nearer and beheld the beast mounted upon the oak, on the 
beginning of the same branch, to which Friday clung at the 
farther end, where the bear durst not come. Hereupon 
Friday cried out, ** Now, master, me make much laugh ; me 
make bear dance.” Upon which lie fell a shaking the 
bough, which made the creature look behind him, to see 
how he could retreat. Then as if ttie hear had understood 
his stam*mcring English ; Why you no come farther, Mr. 
Bear?” said he, “ pray, Mr. Bear, come far here;” and 
then indeed we all burst into^a laughter, ecpecially when 
we perceived Friday drop like a squirrel upon the ground, 
leaving the beast to make the best of his way down the tret.

LIFE AN0 ADVENTURES 


And now thinking it the most convenient time to shoot the 
creature, Friday cried out, O dear master, no shoot, me 
ahoot by and by when taking up the gun, “ me no shoot 
yet,'’ said he, ** me make one more much laugh.” And ac- 
cordingly he was as good as his word ; for tiie creature de- 
scending backward from the tree very leisurely, before’ he 
could lay one foot on the ground, Friday shot him through 
the ear, stone dead ; and looking tp see whether we were 
pleased, he burst into a hearty laugh, saying, “ So we kill 
de bear in my conntry, not with the gun, but with much long 
arrows.” Thus ended our diversion to our great satisfac- 
tion ; especially in a place where Uic terrible bowlings struck 
us with a coutinual terror. But the snows now growing 
very deep, particularly on the mountains tlie ravenous crea- 
tures were then obliged to seek lor sustenance in the vil- 
lages, where coming by surprise on the country people kil- 
led several of them, besides a great number of their sheep 
and horses. 

• Our guide told us, we had yet one more dangerous place 
to pass by 5 and if there were any more wolves in the coun- 
try, there wc should hud them. Tliis was a small plain, 
encompassed with woods, to get through a long lane to tlie 
village where we were to lodge. When we entered the wood, 
the sun was within half an hour of setting ; and a little af- 
ter it was set, we came into the plain, which was not above 
two furlongs over, and then we perceived hve great wolves 
cross the road, without taking notice of us, and so swift as 
though they were pursuing after their prey. Hereupon our 
guide, believing there were moi'e coming, desired us to be 
upon our guard. Accordingly our eyes were very circum- 
spect, till about half a league farther, we perceived a dead 
horse, and near a dozen of wolves devouring its carcase. 
IV^y man Friday fain would have fired at them, but 1 would 
not permit him ; nor had we gone hall' over the plain, biit we 
beard dreadful bowlings in a wood on our left, when pre- 
sently we saw a hundred come up against us, as though they 
had been an experienced army. This obliged us to form 
ourselves in the best manner ; and then 1 ordered that every 
other man should fire ; aud those who did not, might be rea- 
dy to give a second volley, should they advance upon us ; 
and then every man should ihake use of his pistols.^ But 
there was no necessity for this ; for the enemy being terrified, 
itopped at the noise of the fire ; four of them were shot 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

dead, and several others being wounded, went bleeding away, 
as we could very plainly discover by the snow. And now 
remembering wdiat had been often told me, tlmt such was 
the majesty of a man’s voice, as to strike terror even in the 
fiercest cfeatures, 1 ordered all my companions to halloo, as 
loud as possible ; and in this notion 1 wa^ not altogethet 
mistaken ; for they immediately turned about upon the first 
halloo, and began to retire ; upon which, ordering a second 
volley in their rear, they galloped into the wooiis with great 
precipitation. 

Thus we had some small time to load our pieces again, 
and then made all I he haste w e could on our way ; but we 
had not rode far, before wc were obliged to put ourselves 
ill a jiosture of defence as before, being alarmed wiilia very 
dreadful noise in the same wood, on onr left hand, the 
way as we were to pass,, only that it was some distance 
from us. By this time the darksome clouds began to spread 
over the elements, and the night growing very dusky, made 
it so much the more to our disadvantage j but still the noise 
increasing, wc were fully assured that it was the howling 
and yellfiig of those ravenous creatures ; w1ien presently 
lliree troops of wohes on our front appeared in sight, as 
though a great number of them bad a mind to surround tts 
and devour us in spite of fate. But as they did not fall 
upon us immediately, we proceeded on our journey in as swift 
a manner as the roads would permit our horses, which was 
only a large trot. It was in this manner we travelled, til) 
such a time as we discovered another wood, and had Une 
prospect of its entrance, through which we were to pass, at 
the farthest side of the plain. But surely none can express 
the terror we were in, wiien afiproaching the lane, we per- 
ceived a confused number of the fiercest wolves, standing, 
as it were, guarding its entrance. Nor were we long in 
this amazement, before another occasion of horror presefit«» 
ed itself ; for suddenly we heard the report of a gun at ano* 
thdr opening in the wood ; and looking that way, out ran a 
horse bridk^ and saddled, flying with the greatest swiftness^ 
and no less than sixteen or seventeen wolves pursuing after 
him, m order to devour the poor creature j and unquestion- 
ably they did so, after they bad run him down, not being able 
to bold out that swiftness with which he at first escaped 
them. 



LIFB AND ADVSNTURE6 


140 

When we rode up to that entrance from whence the horse 
came forth, there lay the carcase of another horse and two 
men, mangled and torn by these devouring wolves : and un- 
doubtedly one of these men was the person who tired the 
gun which we had heard, for the piece lay by him ; but, 
alas ! most of the upper parfof his body aiid his head were 
entombed in the bowels of these ravenous creatures. 

What course to take, whether to^ proceed or retreat, we 
could not tell ; but it was not long" before the wolves them- 
selves made us come to a resolution ; for such numbers 
surrounded us, every one of whom expected their prey, 
that were our bodies to be divided among tliem, there would 
not be half a mouthful a-piece. But happy, very happy it 
was for us, that but a little way from the entrance, there lay 
some very large timber trees, which 1 supposed had been 
cut down and laid there for sale ; amongst vvliich I drew my 
little troop, placing ourselves in a line behind one large tree, 
which served us for a breast-work, when desiring them to 
alight, we stood in a triangle, or three fronts, closing onr 
horses in the centre, the only place where wc could pre- 
serve them. 

Never certainly was there a more furious charge than 
what the wolves made upon' us in this place : and the sight 
of the horses, which were the principal prey they aimed at, 
provoked their hunger, and added to their natural fierceness. 
They came on us with a most dreadful noise, that made the 
woods ring again ; and beginning to mount the pieces of 
timber, 1 ordered every man to fire, as before directed: 
and, indeed, so well did they take their aim, that they killed 
several of the wolves at the first volley ; but still we were 
obliged to keep a continual firing, by reason they on 
like devils, pushing one another with tiie greates^lftliy. — 
But our second volley something abated their courage, when 
Stopping a little, we hoped they would have made the best 
of their way ; however it did not prove so, for others made 
a new attempt upon us ; and though in four firings we killed 
seventeen or eighteen of them, laming twice as many, yet 
they several times sui^essively came on, as though they 
valued not their lives for the sake of their prey. 

Unw illing was 1 to spend our last shot too suddenly^ and 
therefore calling my other ser^^aiit, and giving him a horn 
of powder, bid him lay a large train quite along the timber, 
which he dfd, while Friday was charging my ftisse Rnd hb

own with the greatest dexterity. this time the wolves 
coming up the timber, I set fire to the train, by snapping a 
discharged pistol close to the powder. This so scorched 
and terrified them, that some fell down, and others jumped 
ill among us j but these were immediately dispatched, when 
all the rest, frightened with the liglit, which (he darksome 
night caused to appear more dreadful, began at length to re- 
tire ; upon which, ordering our last pistols to be fired at 
once, giving at the sam'e time a great shout, the wolves were 
obliged to have recourse to their swiftness, and turn tail ; 
and then we sallied out upon twenty lame ones^ cutting them 
in pieces with our swords, which obliged them to howl la- 
mentably, to the terror of their fellows, who resigned to us 
the field as victorious conquerors. And, indeed, I question 
whether Alexander, king of Macedonia, in any of liis con- 
quests had more occasion for triumph than we had ; for he 
was but attacked witli numerous armies of soldiers, where- 
as our little army was obliged to combat a legion of devils, 
as it were, worse than the cannibals, who, the same moment 
they had slain us, would have sacrificed us, to satisfy their 
voracious appetites. 

Tlius ended our bloody battle with the beasts, having 
killed threescore of them, and saved our lives from their 
fury- \Ne still had a league farther to ^o, when, as we 
went, our ears were saluted with their most unwelcome 
bowlings, and we expected every moment another attack. 
But, in an hour’s lime, we arrived at the town where wc 
were to lodge ^ ami here we found the place strictly guard- 
ed, and all in terrible confusion, as well they might, for 
fear of the bears and wolves breaking into the village, in or- 
der to prey upon their cattle and people. The next morning 
we were obliged to take a new guide, by reason the other 
fell very bad of bis wounds, which be had received, as be- 
fore mentioned. After we had reached Thouloiise, we 
came into a warm, pleasant, and fruitful country, not infest- 
ed with wolves, nor any sort of ravenous creatures t and 
when we told our story there they much blamed our , giiide» 
for condticdag us through the forest at the foot of the moun- 
tains, ill such a severe season, when the snow obliged the 
wolves to seek for shelter in the woods. When we inform- 
ed tlnem in what manner ^e placed ourselves, and the 
horses in the centre> they exceedingly reprehend^ us, and 



LIFR AND ABVENTURIES 

told US, it was a hundred to one but we had been all de- 
stroyed ; for that it was the very si^ht of the horses (their 
so much desired prey) that made the wolves more ragingly 
furious than they would have been, wdiich was evident, by 
their being at other times really afraid of a gnn ; but then 
being exceedingly hungry and furious upon that acco-unt, 
their eagerness to come at the horses made them insensible 
of their danger; and that* if we bad not, by a continual fire, 
and at last by the cunning stratagem of the train of powder, 
got the better of tljeni, it had been great odds if their num- 
ber had not overpowered us ; besides, it was a great mercy 
we alighted from our horses, and fought them with that cou- 
rage and conduct, which had we failed to do, every man of 
us, with our beasts, liad been devoured ; and, indeed, this 
was nothing but truth ; for never, in my life, was I so sensi- 
ble of danger, as when three hundred devils came roaring 
upon us, to shun whose unwelcome company, if 1 was sure 
to meet a storm every week, ! would rather go a thousand 
leagues by sea. 

I think 1 have nothing uncommon in my passages through 
France to take noli(-e of, since other travellers of greater 
learning and ingenuity have given a more ample account 
than my pen is able to set forth. From Thotdouse I travel- 
led to Paris, from thence to Calais, where I took shipping, 
and landed at Dover the I4th of January, in a very cold 
season. 

Thus come to tlie end of my travels, I soon discovered 
my new found estate, and ail the bills of exchange I had 
wtre eiifrently paid. The good ancient widow, my only 
|mvy eiMinsellor, thought no pains or care too great to pro- 
my advantage ; nor had 1 ever occasion to blame her 
fidelity , which drew from roe an ample reward. I was for 
leaving my efiecU in her hands, intending to set put for 
liiaboin aod to the Brazils ; but, as in the Desolate Island, 
I imd some doubts about the Romish religion, so 1 Anew 
fiiere was little eocouragement to settle there, unless 1 
would npoatatize from the ortiiodox faith, or live in conti- 
nual fear of the Inquisition. Upon this account 1 feeolved 
to aell my plantation ; and, for that kiteiit, I wrote In foy 
old friend at Lisbon, who returned meiati answer to my ffreat 
■atiafnetion ; which was, that he would sell it ^ good ac- 
‘ count ; however, tf 1 thought it convenient to gtac him li- 
berty to offer it in my name to the two merobpuia* tbf cur- 



OF ROBIKSOK CRUSOE, l4t 

vivors of my trustees, residing at the EraKits, who oonsequeot* 
ly knew its intrinsic value, having lived just upon the spot, 
and who I was sensible w'ere very rich, and therefore miglil 
be the more willing to purchase it, he did not in the leMlt 
doubt, but that 1 should make four or five thousand pieces 
of ciglit more of it, than I could if I disposed of it in any 
other manner whatsoever. 

You may be sure 1 could not but agree with this kind and 
ingenuous proposal ; anri immediately 1 sent him an order 
to oijijer it to tiiein, which be accordingly did ; so that about 
eight months after, the ship being in that time returned, he 
gave me a satisfactory account, that they not only willingly 
atcc[)te<l the offer, but that they had also remitted 33,000 
pieces of eight, to a correspondent of their own at Lisbon, 
in order to pay for the purchase. 

Hereupon, in return, I signed the instrument of sale, ac- 
cording to form, which they had sent from Lisbon, and re- 
turned it again to my old friend, he having sent me, fof rny 
estate, bills of three hundred and twenty eight tliousand 
pieces of eight, reserving the payment of one Imndred moi- 
(lores per aimmn, which I had allowed him diiriii^Jife, like- 
wise fifty to his son during life also, according to my faith- 
ful promise, which the plantation was to make good as a 
rent charge. 

And thus having led my »^ader to the knowledge of Ijjtc 
first parts of my life, so remarkable for the many peculfl^r 
providences that attended it, floating in the ocean of uncer- 
tainty and disappointment, of adversity and prosperity, 
ginning fo(»lishlN, and yet ending happily ; methiiiks now 
that 1 am come to a safe and pleasant haven, it is time lo 
cast out my anchor, and, laying up my vessel, bid, for a 
while, adieu to foreign adventures. 1 had no other conceriM 
to look after, but the care of my brother’s two sons, which, 
with the good widow's persuasions obliged me to contimie 
at home seven years. One of these children I bred up a 
gentleman, and the other an experienced sailor, remarkable 
for bis courage and bravery. Besides this, 1 married a ?lx- 
tnous young gentlewoman, of a very good family, by whom 
i bad two sons and one daughter. But my dear and tender 
wife leaving Ibis earthly stage, (as in the second part of my 
life yon will hear,) which reoUmy soul, m it were, asunder, 
my native country became weary and tiresome to me ; and 
my nephew happening to come from sea, ten^pted me lo 



^44 LIFE AND adventures, &C. 

yeutute another voyage to the East-Indies, which I did in 
the year 1094, at which time 1 visited my island, and in- 
fotmed myself of every thing that happened since my dc> 
parture. 

One might reasonably imagine, that what I had suffered, 
together with advanced age, and the fear of losing, not only 
what I had gotten, but my life also, might have choked up 
all the seeds of useless ambition and curiosity, and put a 
lasting period to my wandering inclinations. But as nothing 
but death can fully allay the active part of my life, no less 
remarkable for the many various contingences of it, you will 
next perceive how 1 visited my little kingdom, saw ray suc- 
cessors the Spaniards, had an account of the usage they met 
with from the Englishmen, agreeing and disagreeing, uniting 
and separating, till at last they were subjected to the Spa- 
niards, who yet used them very honourably, together with 
the wonderful and successful battles over the Indians, who 
invaded and thought to liave conquered the island, but were 
repelled by their invincible courage and bravery, having 
taken eleven men and hve women prisoners, by which, at ray 
return, I found about twenty young children op my little 
kingdom. Here 1 staid twenty days, left them supplies of 
all necessary things, as also a carpenter and smith, and 
shared the island into parts, reserving the whole property to 
myself. Nor will you be insensible, by the account of 
these things, of several new adventures I have been engag- 
ed in, the battles I have fought, the deliverances I have met 
with ; and while, in the surprising relations of such remark- 
able occurrences, 1 shall describe many of God's kindest 
providences to me in particular, no less conspicuous in the 
same goodness, power, and majesty of our great Creator, 
shown one way or other over the face of the earth, if duly 
adverted to. 



THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF 


ROBINSON CRUSOE; 

Wherein are contained several strange and surprising ae* 
counts of his Travels^ and his most remarkable Transact 
tions both by Sea and Land ; with his wondrful vision 
of the Angelic World. 

WHEN we consider the puissant force of nature, and 
what mighty intluence it has many times over the temper of 
the mind, it will be no such great wonder to think, that my 
powerful reason should be overcome by a much stronger in- 
clination. My late acquired kingdom ran continually in my 
thoughts all the day, and I dreamed of it in the night ; nay« 
1 made it the continual subject of my talk, even to imperti- 
nence, when 1 was awake. 1 had such vapoure in my head, 
that 1 actually supposed myself at my castl ; that I not 
only perceived Friday’s father, the old Spaniard, and the 
wicked sa'ilors, but that 1 talked and discoursed with them 
about their manner of living ^ that 1 heard the things related 
to me, which I found afterwards to be too true ^ and that 1 
executed my judgments with the greatest severity upon the 
od'enders. And, indeed, this anticipating all the pleasing 
joys of my life, scarcely afforded me one pleasant hour : my 
dear and tender wife could not but take notice of it, which 
drew these affectionate speeches from her ; “ My dear/’ said 
she, ** 1 am really persuaded that some secret impulse from 
Heaven occasions in you a determination to see the island 
again ; nor am 1 less sensible, but your being engaged to 
me and these dear children, is the only hinderance of yonr 
departure. 1 know, my dear, if I were in the grave, you 
would not long continue at home j prevent not your bappt* 
ness on my account, whose only comfort centres in you* 
AU that 1 can object is, that such an hazardous undertaking 
is no way consistent with a , person of your years ^ hut if 
you are resolved to go,” addid she, weeping, ** only permit 
me to bear vou company, and that is all that I desire.** 

Such endearing tenderness,* graced with the most inno- 
cent, ind yet most powerful cbarnis, brought me intensihly 
into my right understanding ; and when i considered all the 
' transactions of my life, and particularly my new engage^

inent ; tliat I had now one child already born, and my wife 
big of another ; and that I had no occasion to seek for 
more riches, who already was blessed with sufficiency^ with 
mncli struggling 1 altered my resolutions at last, resolving to 
apply myself to some business or other, which might put a 
period to such wandering inclinations. Hereupon I bougiit 
a little farm in the county of Bedford, with a resolution to 
move thither ; upon this tliere was a pretty convenient 
house, surrounded with land, very capable of improvement, 
which suited my temper, as to planting, managing, and cul- 
tivating. 

Nor was I long before I entered upon my new settlement, 
having bought ploughs, arrows, carts, waggons, horses, 
cows, and slieep j so that now I led the life of a country 
gentleman, and as happy in my retirement as the greatest 
monarch in the world. And what made me think my hap- 
piness the greater was, tl»at I was in the middle state of life, 
which my father had so often recommended, mucli resem- 
bling the felicity of a rural retirement which is elegantly de- 
scribed by the poet in these lines : 

Free from all vices, free from care, 

Age has no paiu, and youth no snare* 

But in the midst of tliis my happiness, I was suddenly 
plunged in the greatest sorrow that 1 could possibly endure ; 
for, when I least expected it, my dear and tender wife was 
forced to submit to the irresistahle power of Death, leaving 
this transitory life for a better. It is impossible for me to 
express the beauties of her mind, or the loveliness of her 
person ; neither can I too much lament her loss, which my 
latest breath shall record ; her influence was greater over 
me than the powers of my own reason, the importumties of 
friends, the instructions of a father, or the melting tears of 
ii tender and disconsolate motlier ; in a word she wjis the 
^irit of all my affairs, and the centre of my enterprises. — 
But uow since the cruel hand of Death had closed my dear- 
est*8C}es, I seemed in my thoughts a stranger to the world ; 
Illy privy counsellor being gone, I was like a ship without a

looked around me in this busy world, one part labouring 
for bread, and the oilier squandering away tlieir estates ; 
this put me in mind how i had lived in my litUe kingdom.

where botli reason ami religion dictated to me, that there 
was something that certainly was the reason and end ot' life, 
which was far superior to what could be hoped for on this 
side the grave. My country delights were now as insipid 
and dull, as music and science to those who have neither 
taste nor ingenuity. In short, resolving to leave off house- 
keeping, I left my farm, and in a few months returned to 
London. 

But neither could that great city, so famous for its variety 
of entertainment, ati'ord me any agreeable delight; a state 
of idleness I found to be the very dregs of life, and most 
liurtful to body and soul. It was now the beginning of the 
year KUU, at which time iny nephew (who, as I before ob- 
served, had be<m brought up to the sea, and advanced to be 
captain of a ship) was returned’ from a short voyage to Bil- 
boa, the first he had made in that station. He comes to me 
one morning, telling me, that some merchants of his ac- 
quaintance liad proposed to iiim tn go a voyage for them to 
the Ivast Indies and China, in the manner of private traders ; 

and now, uiich’,” said he, ** if youMl accompany me thither, 
ril engage to land >ou upon your own island, to visit the 
state of jour little kingdom.” 

Just before lie came in, my thoughts were tixed to get a 
jiatent for its possession, and then to till it with inhabitants. 
After I had paused a while, and looked steadfastly on him. 
What devil or s|)irit,” said I, “ sent you with this un- 
lucky errand f’ He started at tirst ; but recovering him- 
self, when he perceived 1 was not ofl’ended, “ Sir,” replied 
he, “ what I have proposed cannot, I hope, be styled un- 
lucky, since certainly \ou must be desirous to see jour little 
territory, where you reigned with more content than any of 
your brother kings in tiie universe.” — “ Ncpliew,'’ said I, 
“ if you will leave me there, and call for me as you come 
back, I care not if 1 give niy consent but be answered, 
that the naerchanls would not allow their vessel, laden 
with an infinite value, to return there again, which was a 
month's sail out of their way ; “ besides, 8ir,” said be, “ if I 
should miscarry, wa.s your request granted, why then you 
would be locked up as before.” I’his, indeed, carried a 
great deal of reason in it ; bat we found out a remedy, and 
that was to carry a framed sloo|) on board, ready to be set 
up in the island, by the assisiaitceof some carpenters, which 
w’e should carry with us, that be fitted in a few days,

to go to sea. 1 was not long in forming my resolution, 
whicli overswayed my good friend, the widow's persuasions 
and the natural affection 1 bore to my young children. I 
nrade my will, and settled my estate in such a manner, that 1 
was perfectly sure my poor infants would have justice done 
them. The good widow not only undertook to make pro- 
vision for my voyage, but also took charge of my domes- 
tic affairs, and to provide for my children’s education ; and 
indeed no mother could take more care, or understand the 
office better ; for which I lived to reward and return her my 
Iiearty thanks. 

The beginning of January, 1694-5, my nephew being 
ready to sail, 1 and Friday went on board in the Downs on 
the 0th, having, besides that sloop already mentioned, a very 
considerable cargo for my new colony. First, I had some 
servants, whom 1 proposed to leave there, as they should 
appear willing ; there were two carpenters, a smith, and a 
very ingenious fellow who was Jack-of-all-trades ; for he w as 
not only a cooper by trade, but also was dexterous at mak- 
ing wheels, and hand-mills to grind corn, likewise a good 
turner, and a good pot maker. 1 also carried a tailor, who 
consented to stay in my plantation, and proved a most ne- 
cessary fellow in the island. As to my carga, it consisted 
of a sufficient quantity of linen, and English stuffs for cloth- 
ing the Spaniards that 1 expected to find there ; as likewise 
gloves, hats, shoes, stockings,; together with beds, bedding, 
and household stuff', especially kitchen utensils, with pots, 
kettles, pewter, brass, A c. also nails, tools of all sorts, sta- 
ples, books, hinges, and all other things necessary ; all which, 
1 think, cost me about three hundred pounds. Nor was 
this all ; for 1 carried a hundred spare arms, muskets, aud 
fusees, besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of seve- 
ral sorts of shot, two brass cannon, besides swords, cutlas- 
ses, and the iron part of some pikes and halberts. 1 made 
my nephew take with us two small quarter-deck guns, more 
than he had occasion for in his ship, to leave behind, if there 
was a necessity ; so that we might build a fort there, and 
man it against all opposers whatsoever. 

Well, we put out to sea; and though I can’t say this 
voyage was so unprosperous.as my others had been, yet 
contrary winds drove us so far northward, that we were 
obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland, where we lay 
wind-bound two and twenty days. Here, i^ecd, our pro-

Visions were very cheap, and we added to our ship’s stores 
by taking several live hogs, two cows and calves, which 1 
then resolved to put on shore in my island, if our necessities 
did not call for them. On the 6th of February we sailed 
from Ireland, with a very fair gale, which lasted for some 
days ; and 1 think it was about the 20th of the same month, 
late in the evening, when the mate informed us, that he 
saw a flash of Are, and heard a gun fired ; and when he .was 
speaking, a boy came in and told us, that the boatswain had 
heard another. Upon which we all ran to the quarter deck, 
from whence, in a few moments, we perceived a terrible 
fire at a distance. We had immediately recourse to our 
reckonings, in which we were all of opinion, that there 
could be no land that way, it appearing to be at N. N. W. 
Hereupon we concluded that some ship had taken Are at 
sea, and that it could* not be far off, by the report of the 
guns which we had heard. We made np directly to it, and 
in half an hours time, the wind being fair, we could plainly 
perceive a great ship on Are in the middle of the sea.— 
Touched, with this unhappy disaster, and considering my 
former circumstances, when the Portuguese Captain toojc 
me up, I immediately ordered Ave guns to be* Ared, that the 
poor creatures, not seeing us, it being dark, (thouglrwc 
could perceive their flame,) might be sensible there was de* 
liverance at hand, and consequently might endeavour to 
save themselves in their boat. Nor was it long before tJie 
ship blew up in tiie air, and the Are was extinguished in 
the ocean. But supposing them to be all in their boats, wc 
hung out our lanterns, and kept Aritig till eight o'clock iii 
the morning j when, with our perspectives, we beheld two 
boats full of people, making towards us, though the tide was 
against them : then spreading out our ancient, and hanging 
out a waft, as a signal for them to come on board, in half 
an hour's time we came up with them, and took them all in, 
there being no less than sixty>four men, women, and chil- 
dren. It was a French merchant ship of three hundred tons, 
home ward bound from Quebec in the river of Cana<ta«-— 
The master informed me how, by the negligence of the 
steersman, the steerage was set on Arc : that, at his outcry 
for help, the Are was, as he thought, totally extiiigiiisiied : 
but that some sparks getting between the timber and w ifiiiii 
the ceiling, it proceeded into the hold, where there was no 
resisting it ; and then they got into their boats, as creatures

in the last extremity* with what provisions they had, together 
with oars, sails, and a compasis^ intending to go back to 
Newfoundlaiwl, the viind blowing at S. E. and by E. though 
there \yere several chances against them, as storms to over- 
set and founder them, rains and colds to benumb and perish 
their limbs, and contrary winds to keep them back and 
starve them ; but, said he, in this our great distress, we 
heard the welcome report of your guns, when with unspeak- 
able joy, taking down our masts and sails, we were resolved 
to lie by till morning ; but perceiving your light, we set 
our oars at work, to keep our boat a-liead, the sooner to 
attain your ship, the happy instrument of our deliver- 
ance. 

Indeed no one can express the joy of these poor creatures 
on this occasion 5 fear and grief are easily set forth ; sighs 
and tears, with a few motions of the hands and head, are all 
the demonstrations of these passions; but an excess of joy 
carries in it a thousand extravagances ; especially, I think, 
among the French, whose temper is allowed to be more vo- 
latile, passionate, sprightly, and gay, than that of other na- 
tions* Some w'ere weeping, tearing themselves in the great- 
est agonies of sorrow, and running stark mad about the ship, 
while the rest were stamj)ing with their feet, wringing tlieir 
hahds, singing, laughing, swooning away, vomiting, Aiint- 
ing, with a few returning hearty thanks to the Almighty, and 
crossing themselves. 1 think, if 1 am not mistaken, our 
surgeon was obliged to let thirty of them blood. But among 
the passengers, tliere were two priests, the one an old the 
other a joung man; but what amazed me more was, that 
the oldest was in the worst plight; for no sooner did he 
perceive himself freed from danger, but he dropped dow n, as 
it were, without life, and to every one’s appearance quite 
dead ; but the surgeon chafing and rubbing his arm, opened 
a vein, wliich at first dropped, and then fiow'ing more freely, 
the old man began to open his eyes, and in a quarter of an 
hour was well again. But soon remembering this happy 
change, the joy of which w hirled his blood about'faater than 
the vessels could convey it, he became so feverish, as made 
him more fit for bedlam than any other place ; but the sur- 
geon giving him a sleeping dose, he w'as perfectly composed 
the uext morning. 

Remarkable, indeed, w^as llic behaviour of the young 
priest. At his entrance on board tlie ship, he fell on his face

ill the most humble prostration to the Almighty. I thought, 
indeed, he had fallen into a swoon, and so ran to help him 
up i but he modestly told me, he was rcluruiiig thanks to the 
Almighty, desiring me to leave him a few moments, and 
that, next to his Creator, he w'oiild return me thanks also. 
And indeed lie did so, about three minutes after with great 
seriousness and affection, while the tears stood in his eyes, 
which convinced me of the gratitude of his soul. Nor did he 
less show his piety an3 wisdom, in applying himself to his 
country people, and labouring to compose them, by the most 
powerful reasons, arguments, and persuasions. — And when, 
indeed, these people had taken their night’s repose, in such 
lodgings as our ship would allow, we found nothing but the 
best of manners, and the most civil acknowledgments, for 
which the French are eminently remarkable. The next day 
the Ca])tain and one of the priests desired to sjicak w ith me 
and my ncjihew the commander. They told us, that they ha<l 
saved some inoiiey and valuable things out of the ruined ves- 
sel, which was at our service; only that they' desired to be 
set on shore some where in our wu>. At first my nephew 
was for d('cepting the money ; but 1 (who knew how hard 
my case, would have been, bad the Portuguese Captain serv- 
ed me so) persuaded him to the contrary ; and therefore told 
them, that as w e had done nothing but what we were obliged 
l<».d(», by nature and liuraanily, and what we ourselves might 
expect from others in such calamity, so w'C took them up to 
save, them, not plunder them, or leave them linked upon the 
land, to perish for waul of subsistence, and therefore would 
not acce})t their money : but as to landing them that was a 
great ditbculty ; for being bound to the East Indies, it was 
impossible wilfully to change our voyage upon their parti- 
cular account, nor could my nephew (who was under cliarj* 
ter party to pursue it by way of Brazil) answer it to the 
/reighters. — All that we could do, wa.s to put ourselves in 
the way of meeting some ships home-ward liouud from the 
West Indies, that if possible, they might get a passage to 
France or England. Indeed, they were very thankful for 
our first kindness ; but were under great concern, especially 
tlie passengers, at their being carried to the East Indies. 
They begged, therefore, I would keep on the banks of New- 
foundland, where probably they might meet with some 
ship or sloop, to carry them to Canada, whence they came. 
As this was but a reasonable request, 1 was inclined to

grant it, since it was no breach of charter-party, and the 
laws of God and nature obliged us to do what good we could 
to our fellow-creatures ; and besides the danger we our- 
selves should be in for want of provisions : so we consented 
to carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather 
would permit 5 if not, that we should carry them to Mar- 
tinieo in the West Indies. But, as it happened, in a week’s 
time we made the banks of Newfoundland, where the French 
people hired a bark to carry them* to France. But the 
young priest being desirous to go to the East Indies, 1 readily 
agreed to it, because I liked his conversation, and two or 
three of the French sailors also entered themselves on board 
our ship. 

Now, directing our course for the West Indies steering 
S. and S. by E. about twenty days, with little wind, ano- 
ther adventure happened to exercise our humanity. In the 
latitude of 27 degrees, 5 minutes north, the 19th of March, 
1694-3, we perceived a sail, (our course S. E. and by S.) 
which bore upon us, and then she appeared to be a large 
vessel, having lost her main top-mast and boltsprit ; when 
firing a gun as a signal of distress, wind N. N. W. we soon 
came to speak with her. She was a ship from Bristol, bound 
home from Barbadoes, out of which road she had been forced 
in a hurricane to the westward, in which they lost their 
masts. 

They told us, their expectations were to see the Bahama 
islands, but were driven away by a strong wind at N. N, W. 
and having no sails to work the ship with, but the main- 
course, and a kind of a square sail upon a jury fore-mast, 
because they could not come near the land, were endeavour- 
ing to stand for the Canaries : nay, what w'as worse, besides 
all their fatigue, they were almost starved for want of pro- 
vision, having eat nothing for eleven days ; all that they had 
aboard was sugar, a barrel of fresh water, and seven casks 
of rum. In this ship were passengers, a youtii, his mother, 
and a maid-servant, who were in a most deplorable condition 
for want of food. If I had not gone on board their ship, 
the knowledge of their misery had been concealed from me, 

' and they would have inevitably perished, though, indeed, 
their second mate who was ^^Ptnin, by reason the true 
Captain was not on board when tlie hurricane happened, 
had before informed me that there were such persons on 
board, wliom he supposed to he dead, being afraid to inquire

after them, because he had nothing to give them for relief. 
Hereupon we resolved to let them have what we could 
spare, ordering the mate to bring some of his men on boani 
us, which he did accordingly ; as he and they looked like 
skeletons, when meat was set before them 1 ordered them to 
eat sparingly. But, however, they soon fell sick ; which 
obliged the surgeon to mix som thing in their broth, which 
was to be to them both food and physic. When they were 
fed, we ordered our mate to carry them a sack of bread, 
and four or five pieces of beef ; but the surgeon charged 
them to see it boiled, and keep a guard on the cook-room, 
to prevent the men from eating it raw, and consequently 
killing themselves with what was designed for their relief. 
But. particularly, 1 desired the mate to see what condition 
the poor passengers were in, and the surgeon gave him a 
pitcher of the same broth which he had prepared for the 
men. And being curious to see this scene of misery myself, 

1 took the Captain (as we called the mate of the ship) in 
our own boat, and sailed after them. 

Here was a sad sight indeed ! scarce were the victuals 
half boiled in the pot, but they were ready to break open 
the cook-room door. To stay their stomachs, the mate gave 
them biscuits, which were dipped and softened with the 
liquor of the meat, which they call bruise ; telling them it 
was for their own safety-, that he was obliged to give them 
but a little at a time ; and so feeding them gradually their 
bellies were comfortably filled, and the men did very well 
again. But when they came to the poor gentlewoman in 
the cabin, who for several days had continued without food, 
giving what she had to her son, they found her, as tt were, 
ill the arras of death. She was sitting upon the floor of the 
deck, with her back up against the sides, between two chairs, 
which were lashed fast, and her head shrunk between her 
shoulders, like a senseless corpse. Nothing was wanting in 
my mate to revive and encourage lier ; opening her lips, and 
putting some broth into her mouth with a spoon. But not 
having strength to speak, she lifted up her head with much 
difficulty, intimating that it was now too late ; at the same 
time pointing to the youth, her son, as though she desired 
him to do what he could to ^ave the lad ; and, in a little 
time after, she died. * 

The youth, indeed, was not so far gone, yet lay stretched 
out oo the cabin bed, like one that had scarce any life. In

Ills mouth was a piece of an old glove, the rest of which he 
had cat up. At hrst he vomited what the mate had given 
him ; but at length began sensibly to revive, though in the 
greatest concern for the death of his tender mother. 

As to the poor maid, she lay by lier mistress, like one in 
the last pangs of death : her limbs were distorted, one of her 
hands was clasped round the frame of a chair, which she 
grasjied so hard, that it was with some difficulty we sepa- 
ratcfl her from it ; her other arm lay over her head, and her 
t'eet lay both together, set fast against the frame of the cabin 
table } not only being starved with hunger, but overcome 
with grief at the loss of her mistress, whom she loved most 
tenderly. It was a great while before the surgeon could 
bring her to life, and a much longer time before she came 
to her senses. 

After wc had sailed with them some days, we sent them 
five barrels of beef, one of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, 
witli peas, flour, and other things ; taking throe casks of 
sugar, some rum, and some pieces of eight as payment, we 
left them, but took the youth and maiil with us, with all 
Ihcir goods. The lad was about seventeen years old, ver} 
handsome, modest, sensible, and well-bred, but mightily 
concerned for the loss of his honoured mother, having lost 
his father at Barbudoes but a few niontiis before. He bc- 
seecbed the surgeon to intercede with me to take him out 
of the ship ; for that the sailors, by not sparing a small suste- 
nance, bad starved bis mother. But hunger has no bounds, 
no right, and consequently is incapable of any comjiassiou. 
Wlicn the surgeon told him our voyage might put him in 
bad circumstances, and farther from his friends, he said he 
did not if he was delivered from that terrible crew ; 
that as ilte Captain (meaning me) liad saved him from death, 
.so he was sure he would do him no harm ; and, as for the 
maid, when she was restored to her senses, she would l>€ 
no less thankful, let us carry them where we would. And 
indeed the surgeon so represented their case to me, that 1 
consented, and took them on board witli all their goods, 
except eleven hogsheads of sugar 5 hut the youth having a 
bill of lading, 1 made the Commander oblige himself to de- 
li\cr a letter and the deceased^widuw’s goods to Mr. Rogers, 
a merchant at Bristol ; but 1 believe the ship was lost at sea, 
for we never could hear what became of her afterwards.

iokrahle good voy age. But passing by several little incidents 
relating to wind and weatlier, 1 siiall relate wliat is most re» 
markable concerning iny little kingdom, to whieb 1 was then 
drawing near. 1 had great ditliculty in finding it, for as I 
came to, and went from it before, on the south and east side 
of tiie island, as coming from the Brazils, so now approach- 
ing between the main and the island, not having any chart 
of the coast, nor land mark, it obliged us to go on shore on 
several islands in theoiiouth of the river Oroonoko, but to 
no purpose. Thus 1 perceixed, that wliat I thought was n 
continent before, was no sucli tiling, but a long islaml, or 
rather a ritige of sands. On one of these island 1 found some 
Spainards, but they belonged to the isle de Trindad, wImi 
came hither in a sloop to make salt, and try to find some 
pearl muscles. But at length 1 came fair on the soiilli- 
side of my island, and then I prestntly knew the counte- 
nance of my little kingdom; so we brought the ship safe to 
an anchor, broadside witliiii the creek, where stood rnv an- 
cient and venerable castle. 

No sooner did I see the place, but calling for Triday, I 
asked him where lie was; but when he looked a little, he 
clapped his hands, crying, O joy, O there, O yes, (> 
there !” pointing to our old abode, and then fell a dancing 
and capering as if he was mad, and 1 had miicli ado to keep 
him from jumping into the sea, to sxvirn ashore. “ Friday,” 
said 1 ; what do xou think, shall we go to see your father?” 
At the menliouing Ids father’s name, the jioor alfeclionat<- 
creature fell a weeping : “ No, no,” says he, ** me see him 
no more, never see poor father more ! he long ago die, die 
long ago ; he much old man.'’ ‘‘You don’t know that/’ 
said I ; “but shall we sec any body else V' “He looks about, 
and pointing to the hill above my house, cries out, “ We see, 
we see there much men and there which, though I could 
not perceive them with my perspective glass, was true, by 
what the men themselves told me the next day. 

When the English ancient was spread, anti three guns 
fired, as a signal of friendship, we perceived a smoak rise 
from the creek ; upon which 1 ordered the boat out, taking 
Friday with me, and hanging out a white flag of truce, 1 
went on shore, accompanied also by" the young friar, to 
whom I had related the history of the first part of my life ; 
besides, we had sixteen men well armed, in case we had 
met with any opposition.

LIFE ANB ADVBtrtlTRES 

After we had rowed directly into the creeki the first man 
I fixed my eyes upon was the Spaniard, whose life I had 
saved, and whose face I perfectly well knew. I ordered 
them all to stay in the boat for a while ; but Friday, per- 
ceiving his father at a distance, woald have jumped into the 
sea, had they not let the boat go. No sooner was he on 
shore, but he flew like a swift arrow out of a bow to em- 
brace his aged father. Certainly it would melt a man of 
the firmest resolution into the softest tears, to see with what 
uncommon transports of joy he salutad him ^ he first kissed 
him, then stroke his face, took him in his arms, laid him 
under a shady tree, set down by him, then looked as ear- 
nestly at him, as one would do at a picture, for a quarter of 
ati hour together. After this he would lie upon the ground, 
stroke his legs and kiss them, then get up and stare at him, 
as though he was bewitched : but the next day one could 
not forbear laughing to see his behaviour ; for he would walk 
several hours with his father along the shore, leading him 
by the hand, as though he was a lady : while, every now and 
tJien, he would run to the boat to get something for him, 
as a lump of sugar, dram, biscuit, or some thing or other that 
was good. His frolics ran in another channel in the after- 
noon ; when he set old Friday on the ground, he would 
dance round him, making comical postures and gestures ; 
and all the while would be telling him one story or another 
of bis travels and adventures. 

It was on the 10th of April, anno 1695, that 1 set my 
foot upon the island a second time. When ray faithful 
Spaniard, accompanied by one more, approached the boat, 
he little knew who 1 was, till I discovered myself to him. 

“ Seignior,” said I, in Portuguese, “ don't you know me?” 
He spoke never a word, but giving his musket to his attend- 
ant, extended his arms, and saying something in Spanish 
that I did not then understand, he came forward and em- 
braced me, saying, he was inexcusable not to know bis de- 
liverer, who, like an angel sent from heaven, had saved his 
life. He then beckoned to the men to call out his com- 
panions ; asked me if I would walk to my own babita^on, 
and take possession, where 1 should find some mean im- 
provements; but; indeed they were extraordinary ones; for 
they had planted so many trees* so close together, that the 
place was like a labyrinth, which none could find out ex- 
cept themselves, who knew its intricate windings. 1 asked

him the meaiiiog of all these fortifications ? he told ine he 
would give a large account ot what had passed since my 
departure till this time, and how he had subdued some Eng- 
lish, who thought to be their murderers, hoping I would 
not be displeased, since necessity compelled * them to it.— • 
As 1 knew they were wicked villians, so 1 told him, that I 
was not only far from finding fault wiih it, but was rather 
heartily glad that they had subdued them. While we were 
thus talking, the niairwhom he sent, returned, accompanied 
by eleven more, but in such habits, that it was impossible 
to tell what nation they were of, lie first turned to me, 
and pointing to them, “ These, Sir,” said he, “ are some of 
the gentlemen who owe their lives to your goodness then 
turning to them, and pointing to me, he made them sensi- 
ble who I was j and then they saluted me one by one, 
not as ordinary men, but as though they iiad been am- 
bassadors or noblemen, and 1 a triumphant conqueror; for 
their behaviour not only agreed with a manlike, majestic 
gravity, but at the same time was so obliging and courteous, 
as made them agreeable to the last degree. 

Before 1 relate the history of the transactions of my king- 
dom, as 1 had it from the Spaniards own mouth, 1 must 
here insert what 1 oroitled in my former relation. The 
matter is this: Just before we weighed anchor and set sail, 
there happened a quarrel on board the ship, which had like to 
have occasioned a second mutiny, till such time as the cou- 
rageous Captain, taking two of the most refractory prisoners, 
laid them in irons, tlireateniiig, as they were concerned in 
the former disorders, to have them hanged in England for 
running away with the ship. This frightened some of the 
rest, as thinking the Captain would serve them in the 
same manner, though he seemed to give them good words 
for the present. But the mate having intelligence of this, 
made me acquainted with their fears, so that, to make 
them more easy, and ourselves more safe from their conspi- 
racies, 1 was obliged to go down, and pass my honour's 
woril for it, that upon their good behaviour, all that was 
past should be forgiven : in testimony of which, 1 ordered 
the two men's irons to be taken off, and tberaseives for- 
given. But as this had brought us to an anchor at night, 
in which there was a calm, 4he two men that had been in 
irons, stole each of them, a musket, and some other w eapons, 
and taking the ship’s pinnace, not yet hauled up, ran away

to their brother rogues. The next morning we sent tlit 
long-boat, with men to pursue them, but all in vain ; the 
mate, in* revenge, would have demolished my little castic, 
burnt its furniture, and destroyed their plantations, but 
having no orders for it, he did not put it in execution. — 
And thus there were five Englishmen in the island, which 
caused great differences, as my faithful Spaniard gave me a 
perfect account of, in the following manner: 

“You cannot. Sir, but remember the embassy you sent 
me about, and what a disappointment we met with, by your 
absence, at our return. There is but little variety in the 
relation of all our voyage, being blessed with calm weather, 
and a smooth sea. (ireat indeed was the joy of my coun- 
trymen to see me alive, having acted as the principal man 
on board, the Captain of tlie shipwrecked vessel dying before; 
nor was their surprise less, as knowing I was taken prisoner 
by the savages of another nation, they had thought me long 
since entombed in their monstrous bowefs. Ikit when I 
showed tlieni the arms, ammunition, and provisions I had 
brought for them, they looked uj)on me as a second Joseph 
advanced in Pharaoh's court, and immediately prepared to 
come along with me. Indeed they were obliged to trespass 
upon their friendly savages, by borrowing two of their 
canoes, under a pretext for fishing; and they came away 
the next morning, but without any provisions of their own, 
except a few roots, which served them instead of bread. — 
After three weeks absence, we arrived at our habitation. 
Here we met with three English sailors, who, I confess, 
gave us provisions, and that letter of direction you had left 
for us, which informed us how^ to bring' up tame goats, plant 
corn, cure grapes, make pots, and, in short, every thing 
that was necessary for our use. As, in particular, I knew^ 
your method best, so taking Friday’s father to assist me, we 
managed all the affairs ; nor were the rest of the Spaniards 
wanting in their kind offices, dressing food for the English- 
men, who did nothing but ramble and divert themselves in 
the woods, either shooting parrots, or catching tortoises. 
But we had not been long ashore, before we were informed 
of two Englishmen, unnaturally turned out of their com- 
mon place of residence, by the three others above-mention- 
ed ; tliis made my Spaniard^ and me (wliom they now 
looked upon as their go\ernor in your absence) endeavour to 
p^suade them to take them in, that we might be as one family;

but all our tintrcatics were in vain, so that the poor feUews 
finding nothing to be done without industxy, pitched thejb* 
tents on the north side of the island, a little inclining to the 
west, for fear of savages. Here they hiiilt two huts, one K) 
lodge, and the others to lay their stores in ; forint good iiatur- 
ed Spaniard giving them some seeds, they dug and planted 
as I had done, and began to live prettily. IJul \^hile they 
wore thus comfortably going on, the three uniiattiral hrutes» 
llieir counlrynien, in af mere bullying humour, insulted them, 
by saying, the governor (meaning you) had given them 
possession of the island, and <1 — inn Vrn they should build no 
houses upon their ground, without paying rent. The two 
honest men (for so let me now <h‘stinguish tliem) thought their 
three eountrymen only jested, and one of them invited them 
in, to see their line hahitaltons ; while the other facetiously 
told them, that since they built tenements with great im- 
provements, they should, according to the custom of lords, 
give them a longer lease; at tlie same lime desiring them 
to fetch a scriveirer to draw' the writings. One of these 
wretches swearing he should pay for the jest, snatches upo 
fire-hranii, and clapping it to the outside of their hut, very 
fairly set it on lire, which would soon have consumed it, 
had not the honest man thrust him away and trod it out 
with his feet. Hereupon liie fellow returns with his pole, 
with whicli he would have ended his days, had not the 
poor man avoided the blow, when fetching his niusket, he 
knocked down the villain that began the (juarrel. The other 
two coming to assist their fellow, obliged the other honeit 
man to take his musket also, and holli of them presenting 
their pieces, bid the villains stand oil'; and if they did not 
lay down their arms, death should decide tlie dispute one 
way or other. This brought them Xo a parley, in which 
they agreed to take their wounded man and be gone; but 
they were in the wrong that they did not disarm them when 
they had the power, and then make their complaint to me 
and my Spaniards for justice, which might have prevented 
their farther designs against them. And, indeed, so many 
trespasses did they afterwards commit, by treacling cloivn 
their coni, shooting their young kids and goats, and plagu- 
ing them night and day, that they resolved to come to my 
castle, challange all the thfte, and decide their right by one 
plain Ijattle, while the Spaniards stood by to see fair play. 
One day it happened, that two of my Spaniards (one of 



100 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

R'hom understood English) being in the woods, were met 
by one of the honest men, who complained how barbarous 
their countrymen had been in destroying their com, killing 
their milk-goals, and three kids, which deprived them of their 
subsistence ; and that if we did not grant them relief, they 
must be inevitably starved, and so they parted ; but when 
my Spaniards came home at night, and supper being on the 
table, one of them began to reprehend the Englishmen, but 
in a very mannerly way 5 which they resenting, replied, 
** What business had their countrymen in that place without 
leave, when it was none of their ground ? “ Why said 

my Spaniard, calmly, Inglise, they must not starve but 
they replied, “ Let them starve knd be damn’d, they should 
neither plant nor build : and damn them, they should be 
their servants, and work for them, for the island was theirs, 
and they would burn all the huts they should find in the 
island.” “ By this rule,” said my Spaniard, smiling, “ We 
shall be your servants too.” “ Aye, by G — d, and so you 
shall,” replied the impudent rasctil. Upon which, starting 
up. Will Atkins cries, “ Come Jack, let’s have t’other 
brush with them, who dare to build in our domiuions 
Thus leaving us something heated with just passion, away 
they trooped, every man having a gun, pistol and sword, 
muttering some threatening words, that we could then but 
imperfectly understand. That night they designed to mur- 
der their two companions, and slept till midnight in the 
bower, thinking to fall upon them in their sleep ; nor were 
the honest men less thoughtful concerning them ; for at this 
juncture they were coming to find them out, but in a much 
fairer way. As soon as the villains came to the huts, and 
found nobody there they concluded that I and my Spaniard 
bad given them notice, and therefore swore to b6 revenged 
on us. Then they demolished the poor men's habitation ; 
not by fire as they attempted before, bat pulled down their 
houses linrb from limb, not leaving stick or stone on the 
ground where they stood, broke their household stuff in 
pieces tore up their trees, spoiled their inclosure, and in 
short, quite ruined them of every tiling they had. Had 
these people met togethet, no doubt but there w'ould have 
been a bloody battle; but Providence ordered for the 
better; for just as the three were got together, the two 
were at our castle : and when they left us, the three came 
back again, but in great rage, scofiingly telling us what

the;y had done ; w hen one taking hold of a Spaniard^ iiat| 
twirls it round, saying, And you, Seignior Jack Spaniard, 
shall hawe the same sauce, ifyou don't mend your manners/' 
My Spaniard, a grave but courageous man, knocked him 
down w'ith one blow' of the list ; at w hich another villmn 
fired his pistol, and narrowly missed liis body, but wounded 
him a little in the ear. Hereat enraged, the Spaniard takes 
up the fellows's musjket whom lie had knocked down, and 
would have shot liim, if I and the rest had not come out 
and taken the arms from every one of them. 

These Englishmen perceiving they had made all of us 
tlieir enemies, began to cool ; but notwithstanding Uieir 
bitter words, the Spaniards would not return them their 
arras again, telling tliem they would do them no manner of 
harm, if they would live peaceably ; but if they offered any 
injury to tlie plantation or cattle, they would shoot them aa 
they would do ravenous beasts. 1 his made them so mad, 
that they went away raging like furies of hell. They were 
no sooner gone, but in came the two honest men, fired with 
the justest rage, if such can be, having been ruined as afore- 
said, And indeed it was very hard, that nineteen of us 
should be bullied by three villains, conlmually offending with 
impunity. 

“ It was a great while, Sir, before we could persuade the 
two Englishmen from pursuing and undoubtedly killing 
them with their fire-arms; but we promised them justice 
should be done them ; and, in the mean time they should 
reside with us in our habitation. In about five days after, 
these three vagrants, almost starved with hunger, drew near 
our grove, and perceiving me, the governor, and two others 
walking by the side of the creek they very submissively 
desired to be received into the family again. We tola 
them of their great incivility to us, and of their unnatural 
barbarity to their country men ; but yet we would see what 
the rest agreed to, and in half an hours time would bring 
them word. After some debate wc called them in, where 
their two countrymen laid a heavy charge against them, 
for not only ruining, but, designing to murder tbem, which 
they could not deny. But here I was forced to interpose 
as a mediator, by obliging tl^e two Englislimen not to hurt 
them, ueing naked and unarmed ; and that the other three 
should make tbem restitution, by building their two hots.

and feiiciii" their ground in the same manner as it was be- 
forii. Well, being in a miserable condition, they submitted 
to this at present, and lived some time regularly enough, 
except as to the working part, which they did not care for, 
hut the Spaniards would have dispensed with that, had they 
continued easy and quiet. Their arms being given them 
again, they scarce had them a week when they became as 
troublesome as ever ; but an accident happening soon after 
obliged us to lay aside private resentments, and look to our 
common preservation. 

One night. Sir, I went to bed, perfectly well in health, 
and yet by no means could I compose myself to sleep ; upon 
which, being very uneasy, I got up and looked out, but it 
behig dark, 1 could perceive nothing but the trees around 
the castle. I went to bed again, but it was all one, I could 
not sleep j when one of my Spaniards hearing me walk 
about, asked who was up? I answered, “ It is When 
T told him the occasion, Sir,” said he, “ such things are 
not to be slighted ; for certainly there is some mischief plot- 
ting against us.” “ Where are the Englishmen said I. 
He answered, ** In their huts; for they lay separate from 
UB, Sir, since the last mutiny.” “ Well,” said 1, “ some 
kind spirit gives this information for advantage. “Come let 
us go abroad, and see if any thing otfers to justify our fears.” 
Upon which I and some of my Spaniards went up the moun- 
tain not by the ladder, but through the grove, and then we 
were struck with a panic fear on seeing a light, as though 
it were a fire, at a very little distance, and hearing the 
voices of several men. Hereupon we retreated immediately, 
and raised the rest of our forces, and made them sensible 
of the impending danger ; but with all ray authority, I could 
not make them slay where they were, so earnest where they 
to Bee how tilings went. Indeed, the darkne.ss of the night 
gave them opportunity enough to view them by the light of 
the fire undiscovered. As they were in dift'erent parties, 
and straggling over the shore, wc were much afraid that 
tliey should find out our habitatios, and destroy our docks 
of goats, to prevent which, we sent immediately an Eng- 
lishman and two Spaniards to drive the goats into the val- 
where the cave lay ; or, there was occasion, into the 
cave itself : As to ourselves, resuming our native courage 
and prudent conduct, had we not been divided, we durst 
venture to attack a hundred ot them ; but before it was 



or ROBINSON CRUSOE. 109 

verv light, we resolved to send out Friday’s fatlier as a spy^ 
who, immediately stripping himself naked, gets among them 
undiscovered, and in two hours time, brings word, that they 
were two parlies of two diHerent nations, who lately having 
a bloody battle with one another, happened to land by mere 
chance in the same island, to devour their miserable pri- 
soners ; that they were entirely' ignorant of any persons 
inhabiting here; but rntlier being tilled with rage and fury 
against one another, ho believed, that as soon as day-ligirt 
aj^pearod, there would ho a terrible engagement. Old Fri- 
day had scarce ended his relation, when we heard an un- 
common noise, and perceived that there was a horrid en- 
gagement between the two armies. 

“ Such was the curiosity of our party, especially the Eng- 
lishmen, that they would not lie close, though Old Friday told 
them their safety depended upon it ; and that if w'e harl 
])ationce, we sliould behold the savages kill one another. 
However they Used some caution, by going farther into 
tl.e woods, and placing themselves in a convenient place to 
behold the battle. 

Never could there be a more bloody engagement or 
men of more invincible spirits, and prudent conduct, ac- 
cording to their manner and way of fighting. It lasted near 
two hours, till the party w'hicli was nearer our castle, began 
to decline, and at last to fly from their concpierors. We 
were iiiidoubledly put into a great consternation on fini 
account, h they should run into our grove, and coiise- 
(luently bring us into the like danger. Hercu[)on we re- 
solved to kill the first that came, to prevent discovery, and 
that too with our sw ords, and the but ends of our musket#, 
for fear the report of our g\»ns should be heard. 

“ And so indeed, as wc thought, it happened ; for three 
of the vaiujuished army crossing the creek, ran directly to 
the place, as to a thick wood for shelter;^ nor was it long 
before our scout gave us notice of it; as also, that the vic- 
tors did not think it iti to pursue them. Upon this I would 
not siifler them to be slain, but had them surprised and taken 
by our party ; afterwards they proved very good lerTants 
to us, being stout young creatures, and able to do a great 
(leal of work. The remainder of the conquered savage# 
fled to their canoes, and put out into the ocean, while the 
conquerors, joining together, shouted by way of triumph j 



ie4 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and about three in the afternoon they also embarked for 
their own country. Thus we were freed at once from those 
savages and our fears, not perceiving any of these creatures 
for some considerable time after. We found two and thirty 
men dead in the held of battle ; some were slain with long 
ajTows, which we found sticking in their bodies ; and the 
rest were killed with great unwieldly wooden swords, which 
denoted their vast strength, and of which we found seven- 
teen, besides bows and arrows j but we could not find one 
wounded creature among them alive ; for they either ki’ll 
their enemies quite, or carry those wounded away with 
them. 

“ This terrible fight tamed the Englishmen for some time, 
considering how unfortunate they might have been had they 
fallen into their hands, who would not only kill them as 
enemies, but also for fpod as we do cattle : and indeed so 
much did this nauseate their stomachs, that it not only made 
them very sick, but more tractable to the common necessary 
business of the whole society, planting, sowing, and reap- 
ing with the greatest signs of amity and friendship ; so, 
that being now all good -friends, we began to consider of 
circumstances in general; and the first thing we thought 
of was, whether, as we perceived the savages haunted that 
side of the island, and there being more retired parts of it, 
and yet as well suited to our manner of living, and equally 
to our advantage, wc ought not rather to move our place 
of residence, and plant in a much safer place, both for 
the security of our corn and cattle. 

“ After a long debate on this head, it was resolved, or 
rather voted nemine contradicente, not to remove our ancient 
castle, and that for this very good reason, that some time 
or other we expected to hear from our supreme governor, 
(meaning you, Sir,) whose messengers not finding us there, 
might think the place demolished, and all his subject de- 
stroyed by the savages. 

“ As to the next concern, relating to our corn and cat- 
tle, we consented to have them removed to the valley where 
the cave was, that being most proper and sufficient for both. 
But yet, wlien we considered farther, we altered one part 
of our resolution, w hich was to remove part of our cattle 
thither, and plant only part of our corn there ; so that in 
case one part was destroyed, the other might be preserved. 
Another resolotiou was took, which really had a gr^at deal 



OF ROBIINSON CRUSOE. 


105 


of prudence in it, and that was, in not trusting the three 
savages whom we had taken prisoners, with any knowledge 
of the plantations we had made in the valley, of what num- 
ber of cattle we had there, much less of the cave, wherein 
we kept several arms, and two barrels of powder you left 
for ns at your departure from this island. But though we 
could not change our habitation we resolved to make it 
more fortified and more secure. To this end, Sir, as you 
planted trees at some distance before the entrance of your 
)>alace; so we, imitating your example, planted and filled 
up the whole sj)ace of ground, even to the banks of the 
creek, nay, into the very ooze where the tide flowed, not 
leaving a place for lauding; and among these I had planted, 
they had intermingled so many short ones, all of which 
growing wonderfully fast and thick, a little dog could 
scarcely find a passage tlirough them. Nor was this suffi- 
cient, as we llioiiglit, for we did the same to all the ground 
on the right and left hand of us, even to the top of the hill, 
without so much as leaving a passage for ourselves, exce|)t 
by tiie la^lder, which being taken down, notiiing but wliat 
had wings or witchcraft could pretend to come near us. 
And indeed this was exceedingly well contrived, especially 
to serve that occasion, for which we afterwards found it 
necessary. 

“ Thus wc lived two years, in a happy retirement, hav- 
ing, all this time, not one visit from the savages. Indeed 
one morning we had an alarm, which put us in some amaze- 
inenl ; for a few' of my Spaniards' being out very early, 
perceived no less than twenty canoes, as it were coming 
on shore ; upon which returning home with great precipi- 
tation, they gave the alarm, which obliged us to keep 
at home all that day and the next, going out only in the 
night-time to make our observations ; but, as good luck 
would have it, they were upon another design, and did not 
land tiiat time upon the island. 

“ But now there happened another quarrel between the 
three wicked Euglislimcn, and some of my Spaniards.*— 
The occasion was this: One of them being enraged at one 
of the savages, whom he had taken prisoner, for not being 
able to comprehend somethkig which he was showing him, 
snatched up a hatchet in a great fury not to correct, but to 
kill him : yet missing his head, gave him such a barbarous 
cut in the shoulder that he had like to have struck ofl' his 



160 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

arm ; at which one of my good-natnred Spaniards inter- 
posing between the Englishman and the savage, beseeching 
the former not to murder the poor creature; but tliis kiricl- 
ness had like to have cost the Spaniard his life, for the 
Englishman struck at him in the same manner 3 which he 
nimbly and wisely avoided, returning suddenly upon him 
with his shovel,) being all at work about their com land,) and 
very fairly knocked the brutish creature dovMj. Hereupon 
ajnol her Englishman coming to bis fellows assislaiice, laid the 
good Spaniard on the earth 3 when immediately two others 
coming to his relief, were attacked by the third Englishman, 
armed with an old cutlass, vho woundeththem both. This 
uproar soon i-eached our cars, when, we rushing out upon 
them, took the three Englishmen prisoners, and then our next 
question was, what should be done to such mutinous and 
impudent fellows, so furious, desperate, and idle, that they 
were mischievous to the highest degree, and consequently 
not safe for the society to let them live among them. 

Now, Sir, as I was a governor in your absence, so I also 
took tlie authority of a judge ; and having them brought 
before me, I told them, that if they had been of my country, 
1 would have hanged every mother’s sou of them 3 but 
shice it was an Englishman, (meaning you, kind Sir,) to 
whom we were indebted for our preservation and deliver- 
ance, I would, in gratitude, use them with all possible mild- 
ness; but, at the same time, leaving them to the judgement 
of the other two Englishmen, who, I hoped, forgetting their 
resentments, would deal impartially by them, 

“ Hereupon one of his countrymen stood up : *• Sir,” 
said he, leave it not td us, for you may be sensible we 
have reason to sentance them to the gallows : besides. Sir. 
this fellow, Will Atkins, and the two others, proposed to us 
that we might murder joii all in your sleep, which we could 
not consent to: but knowing their inability, and your vigi- 
lance, we did not think tit to discover it before now,*' 

“ Now, Seignior,” said I, “ do >ou hear what is alledged 
against you ? W hat can )ou say to justify so horrid an action 
as to murder us in coUl blood? So far. Sir, was the wretch 
from denying it, that he swore, d — ran him but he would do 
it slid. “ But what have we done to you, Seignior Atkins,’' 
said 1 3 or what will you gain by killing us ? W'bat shall 
we do to prevent >X)u? Must we kill you, or you kill us ? 
Why will you. Seignior Atkins,” said 1 smiling, “ put us to

an miliappy dilemma, such a fatal necessity?** But so 
ijreat a raije did my scoffincj and yet severe jest, put him 
into, that he was to fly at me, and undoubtedly had 

attempted to kill me if lie had been possessed of weapons, 
and iiad not been })re\ented by three Spaniards. 'Fhis un- 
j)arallclcd and villanous carriage, made us seriously consider 
what was to be done. The tw'o Englishmen and the Spa* 
niard, who had saved the poor Indian’s life, mightily peti- 
tioned me to hang one of them for an example to the others 
whicli should be him that had twice attempted to commit 
murder with his hatchet, it being at that time thought im- 
possible the poor slave should recover. But they could 
never gain my consent to put him to death, for the reasons 
a!)ove-mentioncd, since it was an Englishman (even your- 
self) who was my deliverer; and as merciful counsels are 
most prevailing when eaniestly pressed, so I got them to be 
of the same opinion as to clemency. But to prevent them 
doing us any farther mischief, we all agreed, that they should 
have no weapons, as sword, gun, powder, or shot, but be 
expelled from the society, to live as they pleased by them- 
selves ; that neither the two Englishmen, nor the rest of the 
Spaniards, should have conversation with them upon any ac- 
count whatsoever ; that they should be kept from coming 
within a certain distance of our castle ; and if they dared 
to ofTer us any violence, e^her by spoiling, burning, killing, 
or destroying any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fencea, 
or cattle, belonging to the society, we would shoot them as 
freely as we would do beasts of prey, in whatsoever places 
we should find them. 

“ This sentence seemed very just to all but themselves ; 
when; like a merciful judge, I called out to the two honest 
Englishmen, saying, You must consider they ought not*to 
be starved, neither; and since it will be some time before they 
can raise corn and cattle of their own, let us give them some 
corn to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, by which 
time they’ll raise some for tliemselves ; let us also bestow 
upon them six milch goats, four he ones, and six kids, as 
well for their present support, as for a further increase ; 
w ith tools neccesary for their work, as hatchets, an axe, saw, 
and other things convenient to build them huts : all which 
were agreed : but before they took them into possession, I 
obliged them solemnly to swear, never to attempt any thing 
against us, or their countrymen for the future. Thus dis- 



LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ttiissing them from our society,^ they went away, sullen and 
refractory, as though neither willing to go nor stay ; how- 
ever seeing no remedy, they took, what provisions was given 
them, proposing to choose a convenient place where they 
might live by themselves. 

, ** About five days after, they came to those limits appoint- 
ed, in order for more victuals, and sent me word by one of 
my Spaniards, whom fliey called to, where they had pitched 
their tents and marked themselves out a habitation and 
plantation, at the N. E. and most remote part of the island. 
And, indeed, there they built themselves two very handsome 
cottages, resembling our little castle, being under the side of 
a mountain, with some trees already growing on three sides 
of it ; so that planting a few more, it would be obscured from 
night, unless particularly sought for. When these huts were 
hnished, we gave them some dry goat skins for bedding and 
covering j and upon their giving us fuller assurance of their 
good behaviour for the future, we gave them some peas, bar- 
ley, and rice for sowing, and whatever tools we could spare. 

“ Six months did they live in this seperate condition, in 
which they got their first harvest in, the quantity of w hich 
%vas but small, because they had planted but little land ; for, 
indeed, all their plantations being to form, made it more 
difficult, especially as it was a thing out of their element j 
and when they were obliged to make their boards and pots, 
A’C. they could make* little or nothiug of it. But the rainy 
season coming on, put them into great perplexity, for 
want of a cave to keep their corn dry , and prevent it from 
^oiling ; and so much did this humble them, that they beg- 
ged of my Spauiards to help them, to w hich the good-natured 
men readily consented, and in four days space, worked a 
great hole in the side of the hill for them, large enough for 
tlieir purpose, to secure their corn and other things from the 
i^in, though not comimrablc to ours, which bad several ad- 
ditional apartments. 

** But a new whim possessed these rogues about three 
quarters of a year after, which had like to have ruined us. 
and themselves too ; for it seems, being tired and weary of 
this sort of living, which made them work for themsalves, 
without hopes of changing Uie*r condition, nothing would 
save them, but that they would make a voyage to we con- 
tiuent, and try if they could seise npon some of the savages, 
and bring them over as slaves, to do their tlnidgery, while 
they lived at ease and pleasure.

“ Indeed the project was not so preposterous, if tlie^ had 
not pone farther ; l>ut they neither dici, nor proposed any 
thing, hut \^hat had mischief in the design, or the eveQt.«~ 
One morning these thn'c felloHs came down to the limited 
station, and humbly desired to be admitted to talk with us» 
which \vc readily granted; they told us, in short, that be» 
iug tired of their manner of living, and the labour of their 
liands in such employments not being sutbcieiit to procure 
the necessaries of life, they only desired one of the canoes 
we came over in, with some arms and ammunition for their 
defence, and they would seek their fortunes abroad, and 
never trouble us any more. To be sure we were glad 
enough to get rid of such wretched plagues ; but yet 
Jionesty made us ingenuously represent to them by wimt 
we ourselves had suftered, the certain destruction they were 
running into, either of being starved to death or murdered 
by the savages. To this they very audaciously replied* 
that they neither could nor would work ; and consequently 
tliat they might be as well starved abroad as at home ; 
and as to the failing into the hands of the savages, why, if 
they were murdered, that was nothing to us, there was an 
end of them ; neither had they any w ives or children to cry 
after them ; nay, so intent were they upon their voyagis that 
if the Spaniards had not given them arms, so they had but 
the canoe they would have gone without them. 

** Though we could not well spare our fire-arms, rather 
than they shonld go like naked men, we let them have two 
muskets, a pistol, a cutlass, and three hatchets, which were 
thought very sufficient ; we gave them also goats’ flesh, a 
great basket full of dried grapes, a pot of fresh butter a 
young - live kid, and a large canoe sufficient to carry twenty 
men, And thus, with a mast made of a long pule, and a 
sail of six large goat -skins dried, having a fair breere, and 
flood-tide with them, they merrily sailed way, the Spaok 
ntards, calling after them Bon rej/ajo, no mao ever expecting 
to see them more. 

When they were gone, the Spaniards and Englishmen 
would often say to one another, ** O how peaceably do we 
DOW live since tliose turbulent fellows have left us !” — 
Nothing could be farther froni*tbeir thoughts than to behold 
their faces any more ; and yet scarce two and twenty daya

well armed, approacliing towards him. Away he flies with 
speed to our castle, and tells me and the rest, that we were 
ail undone, for that strangers were landed upon the island, 
and who they were he could he tell : but added, that they 
were not savages, but men habited, bearing arms. Why 
then, said 1, we have the less occasion to be concerned, 
since, if they were not Indians they must be friends ; for I 
am sure there is no Christian people upon earth, but what 
will do us good rather than harm. But while we were 
considering of the event, up came the three Englishmen, 
whose voices we quickly knew, and so all our admiration 
of that nature ceased at once. And our wonder was suc- 
ceeded by another sort of inquiry, which was, what could 
be the occasion of their returning so quickly to the island, 
when we little expected, and much less desired their com- 
pany ? but as this was better to be related by themselves, 
1 ordered them to be brought in, when they gave me the 
following relation of their voyage, 

** After two days sail, or something less, they reached 
land, where they found the people coming to give them 
another sort of reception than what they expected or desir- 
ed : for, as the savages were armed with bows and arrows, 
they durst not venture on shore, but steered northwards' six 
or seven hours, till they gained an opening, by which they 
plainly perceived, that the land that appeared from this 
place, was not the main land, but an island. At their en- 
trance into the opening of the sea, they discovered another 
island on the right iiand northward, and several more lying 
to the westward : but being resolved to go on shore some 
Vi here or other, they put over to one of the western islands. 
Here they found the natives very courteous to them/ giving 
them several roots and drii^l fish ; nay, even their women 
too were willing to supply them with what they could 
procure them to eat, bringing it a great way to them upon 
their heads. Among those hospitable Indians they con- 
tinued some days, inquiring, by signs and tokens, what na- 
tion lay around them ; and were informed, that there were 
several fierce and terrible people lived every way, accus- 
tomed to eat mankind ; but for themselves they never used 
such diet, except those that were taken in Imttle, and of 
them they made a solemn feast.

ago, pointing to the moon ; and then two fingers ; that 
at this time, their king had two hundred prisoners, which 
were fattening up for the slaughter. The Englishmen 
were mighty desirous of seeing the prisoners, which the 
others mistaking, thought that they wanted some of ihein 
for their own food : upon which they beckoned to them, 
pointing to the rising^ and then to the setting of the sun ; 
meaning, that by the time it appeared in the east next 
morning, they would bring them some; and indeed they 
were as goofl as their word : for by tliat time they brought 
eleven men and five women, just as so many cows and 
oxen are brought to sea-port towns, to victual a ship. But 
as brutish as these Englishmen were, their stomachs turned 
at the siglit. What to do in this case, they could not tell : 
to refuse the prisoners would have been the highest adVont 
offered to the savage gentry ; and to dispose of thcni, they 
knew not in what manner; howeier they resolved to ac* 
cej)t them, and so gave them in return, one of their 
hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of their 
bullets; things which, thought they were wholly ignorant of, 
yet they seemed entirely contented with ; and dragging the 
poor wretches into the boat with their hands bound behind 
them, delivered them to the Englishmen. But this obliged 
(hem to put off as soon as they had these jireseiits lest the 
donors should liave expect<*d two or three of them to be 
killed, and to be invited to dinner llie next day : and so 
taking leave with all possible respect and thanks, though 
neither of them understood what the others said, they saileil 
away back to the first island, and there set eight of the 
prisoiierajpt liberty. In their vovage they endeavoured to 
comfort, aud have some conversation with the poor cap- 
tives ; but il was impossible to make them sensible of any 
thing ; and nothing they could say or give, or do for them, 
could make them otherwise persuadt^d, but tliat (hey were 
unbound only to be devoured ; if they gave them any 
food, (hey thought it was only to fatten them for the 
slaughter ; or looked ot any one more particularly, the 
poor creature supposed itself to be the first sacrifice; and 
even wheu we brought theip to our island, and began to 
uae them with the greatest humanity and ktndiitas, yet they 
expected every day that their new maater would devour 
them.

dude tlieir unaccountable relation of their voyage, which 
was both amazing and entertaining. Hereupon, 1 asked 
them where their new family was? They told me, they had 
put them into one of their huts, and they came to beg some 
victuals for them. Tliis, indeed, made us all long to see 
them ; and taking Friday’s father with us, leaving only two 
at our castle, wc came down to behold these poor creatures. 

When we arrived at the hut, (they being bound again 
by the Englishmen, for fear of escaping,) we found them 
stark naked, expecting their fatal tragedy , they were 
three lusty men, well shaped, with straight and good limbs, 
between thirty and five and thirty years old ; and five wo- 
men, two of them might be from thirty to forty, two more 
not above four and twenty ; and the last, a comely tall 
maiden of about seventeen. Indeed, all the women were 
very agreeable, both in proportion and features, except 
that they were tawny, which their modest behaviour and 
other graces made amends for, when they afterwards came 
to be clothed. 

“ This naked appearance, together with the miserable 
circumstances, was no very comfortable sight, to my Spa- 
niards, who, for their parts I may venture. Sir, without 
fiattery, to say, are men of the best behaviour, calmest 
tempers, and sweetest nature, that can possibly be j for 
they immediately ordered Friday’s father to see if he knew 
any of them, or if he understood what they could say. 
No sooner did the old Indian appear, but he looked at 
them with great seriousness j ye^J^s they were not of his 
nation, they were utter strangers to him, and none could 
understand his speech or signs, but one woman. This was 
enough t<» answer his design, which was to assure them 
tliev would not be killed, being fallen into the hands of 
Chriviians, who abhorred such barbarity. When they 
Wi re fully satisfied of this, they expressed their joy by such 
strange gestures, and uncoii|mon tones, as it is not possible 
for me to describe. But the woman, their interpreter, was 
or<iered next to inipiire, whetUtf they were content to be 
servants, and would work foirvlie mei^ivho had brought 
them hither to save their live& ? Hereupon, (being at this 
time inbound,) they fell a capering and dancing, one taking 
this tiling upon her shoulders, and the others lh«l mtima> 
ting, that they were willing to do any thing for them. But 
now, Sir, hiving women amongst us, and dreading that

it might occasion some strife, if not blood, I asked the three 
men wimt they would do, and how they intended to use 
these creatures, whether, as servants or wuiueii ? One of them 
very pertly and readily aiisvNcrinl, they nould \»se them as 
both. Gciillenien, said I, as \ouare >our o\mi masters, 1 
am not going to restrain \ou from tliut ; hut, inelhiiikH, for 
avoiding dissensions among \ou, 1 wotild only desire you to 
engage, that none of you will lake more than one fur a wo* 
man or wife, and that having taken this one, none else should 
presume to touch her j for thonnh we !ni\e not a priestly 
authority to marry you, \et it is but reasonable, that wbo» 
ever thus takes a woman, siiould be obliged to maintain lier, 
since nobody has any thing to tlo with her; and this, in- 
deed, ajipeared >o just to all present, that it wits unanimously 
agreed to. The Englishmen then asked my Spaniards, whe- 
ther they designed to take any of them ; but they all an- 
swered, No ; some declaring they bail already wives in 
Spain ; and others, that they cared in»t to join with infidds. 
On the reverse, the Eiiglishineii t . .v each of them a tem- 
porary wife, and so set up a new method of liung. As to 
Friday’s father, the Spaniards, and the three savage servants 
we hud taken in the late battle, they all lived with me in 
our ancient castle; and indeed we supplied the main part 
of the island with food, as necessity required. But the most 
remarkable part of the story is, how these Englishmen, wloj 
had been so much at variance, sliould agree about the choice 
of those women ! yet they took a way good enough to pre- 
vent quarrelling among tin nisehes. They st l the five wo- 
men III one of their huts, and going themselves to the other, 
drew lots which should hare the tirsl choice. Now, he 
that had the tirst lot went to the hut, and fetched out her 
he chose > and it is remarkable, that lie took her that w as 
the most homely and eldest of the number, which made the 
rest of the Eiigiishineii exceedingly merry ; tlie Spaniards 
themselves could not but smile at it ; but, as it hafinened, 
•the fellow had th*? best thought, in choosing one tit lor ap* 
plication and business ; and, indeed, slie proved the best 
wife of all the parcel. 

But when the poor creatures perceived themselves placed 
in a row', aud separated oii^ by one, the\ were again seized 
with an unspeakable terror, as now thinking they were going 
to be slain in earnest ; ami when the Englishmen came to 
take the first, the rest set up a i.tmentable erv, clasped their

arms round her neck, and hanging about her took their 
last farewell, as they thought, in such trembling agonies* 
and afFectiouate embraces, as would have softened the hard- 
est heart in the world, and made the driest eyes melt into 
tears ; nor could they be persuaded but that they were going 
to die, till such lime as Friday’s father made them sensible 
that\he Englishmen had chosen them for their wives, which 
ended all their terror and concern upon this occasion. 

“ Well, after this, the Englishmen went to work, and, be- 
ing assisted by my good-natured Spaniards, in a few hours 
they erected every one of them a new hut or tent for their 
separate lodging, since those they had already were filled 
with tools, houschol 1 stuff, and provision. They all coh- 
tinued on the north shore of the island, but separate us be- 
fore ; the three wicked ones pitched fartlier off, and tlie two 
honest men nearer our castle ; so that the island seemed to 
be peopled in three j)laces, three towns beginning to be built 
for that purpose. And here I cannot but remark, wbat is 
very common, that the two honest men had the worst wives, 
(I mean as to industry, cleanliness, and ingenuity,) while the 
three reprobates enjoyed women of contrary qualities. 

“ Rut another observation 1 made was, in favour of the 
two honest men, to show what disparity there is between a 
diligent application to business, on the one hand, and a sloth- 
ful, negligent, and idle temper, on the other* Both of 
them had the same parcel of ground laid out, and com to 
sow sutheient for them ; but both did not make the same 
improvements, either in their cultivation or their planting. 
The two honest men had a multitude of yoNifg trees planted 
about their habitations, so that when you approached near 
them, nothing appeared but a wood, very' pleasing and de- 
lightful. Every thing they did prospered and flourished ; 
their grapes planted in order, seemed as though managed in 
a vineyard, and were iutiuitely preferable to any of the others. 
Kor were ihev wanting to find out a place of retreat, but 
dug a cave in Ac most retired . part of a thick wood, to se- 
cure their wives and children, with their provisions and chief 
goods, surrounded wdth ititiumcrable stakes, and having 
a IttOSt subtle entrance, in case any mischief should happen, 
either from their fellow countrymen, or the devouring savages. 

“ As to the reprobates, (though I must own they were 
mitch more civilized than before,) instead of a delightful wood 
surrounding their dwellings, we found the words of King 



OF EOBIKSON CRUSOE. 




Solomon lo truly veriticd j *• I went by the vineyard of tin 
slollihil, and it was all over grown witli thorns. * In many 
places their crops was obscured by weeds ; the hedges having 
several gaps in them, the wild goals liad got in, and eaten 
up the corn, and here and there was a dead bush to stop 
the gaps for the present, whicli was no more than shutting 
the stable door after the steed was stolen away. But as to 
their wives, they (as 1 observed before) were more <liligeut, 
and cleanly enough, Especially in their victuals, being in- 
structed by one of the honest men, who had been a cook’s 
mate on board a ship : and very well it was so ; for as he 
cooked himself, his companions and their families lived 
well has the idle husbands, who did nothing but loiter obout 
fetch turtles’ eggs, catch bsU and birds, and do any thing 
but work, and lived accordingly , while the diligient lived 
very handsomely and plentifully, in the most comfortable 
manner. 

** And now, Sir, I come i'» lay before your eyes a scene 
quite different from any thing that e\er happened to us be- 
fore, and perhaps ever befel you in all the time of your 
residence on this island. I shall inform you of its onginal 
in tlie following manner : 

** One morning, Sir, \ery early, there came five or six 
canoes of Itidtaiis on shore, indisputably upon their old cus- 
tom of devouring their prisoners. All that we had to do 
upon such an occasion, was to lie concealed, that they, not 
having any notice of inhabitants, might depart (piietly, after 
performing their bloody execution : whoever tirsl discovered 
tlie savages, was to give notice to ail the three plantations 
to keep witliin doors, and then a proper scout was to be 
placed to give iutelligence of ihcir departure. But, not- 
withstanding these wise measures, an unhappy disaster dis- 
covered us lo the savages, which was like to have caused 
the desolation of the whole island, for, after tl»e savages 
were gone off in their canoes, some of my Spaniards and I 
bmking abroad, and being iiiHauied witl» u curiosity to sec 
what they bad been doing, to our great ama/ement beheld 
three savages fast asleep on the ground, who, either being 
gorged, could not awake when the others went off, or having 
wandered to far into the woods, did not come back in time. 

What to do with them ^t first, w c could not tell ; as for 
slaves we had enough of them already ; and as to killing 
them, neither Christianity nor humanity would suffer us to

shed the blood of persons who never did us wrong. We 
perceived they had no boat left them to transport them to 
their own nation ; and fliat, bv letting them wander about, 
they might discover us, and inform the first savages that 
should happen to land on the same bloody occasion, which 
information might entirely ruin us : and therefore I coun- 
selled my S|)aniards to secure them, and set them about some 
work or other, till we could better dispose of them. 

Hereupon we all went back, and making them awake, 
took them prisoners. It is impossible to express the horror 
they were in, especially, when bound, as thinking they were 
going to be murdered and eaten, but we soon easefi them of 
their fear as to that point. We first took them to the bower, 
where the chief of our country work lay, as keeping goats, 
planting corn, and then carried them to the two Eng- 
lishmen’s habitation, to help them in their business ; but 
happy it was for us all wc did not carry them to our castle, 
as by the sequel will appear. The Englishmen, indeed, 
found them work to do ; hut whether they did not guard 
them strictly, or that they thought they could not better tliern- 
selves, I cannot tell: but certainly one of them ran away into 
the woods, and they could not hear of him for a long time after. 

“ Undoubtedly there was reason enough to suppose he got 
home ill some of the canoes, the savages returning in about 
four weeks time, and going ofl' in the space of two days. 
You may be certain. Sir, this thought could not but terrify 
us exceedingly, and make us justly conclude, that the savage 
would iiilbrm his countrymen of our abode in the island, 
how few' and weak we were in comparison to their numbers ; 
and we expected it would not be long before the English- 
men would be attacked in their habitations : but the savages 
had not seen their places of safety in the woods, nor our 
castle, which it was a great happiness they did not know. 

“ Nor were we mistaken in our thoughts upon this oc- 
casion ; for about eight months after this, six canoes, with 
about ten men in each canoe, came sailing by the north-side 
of the island, w hich they were never accustomed tc do before, 
ami landed about an hour after sun-rise, near a mile from the 
dwelling of the two Englishmen, who it seems, had the 
good fortune to discover them ^botit a league oil'; so that it 
was an lioiir before they could attain the shore, and some 
time loitger before they could come at them. And Hdw 
being confirmed in this opinion that they were certmitiljf

Ofttravcd, they immethately bound the two slaves vhicli nen* 
ielt, causing two of the three men, whom they brought wiiii 
tile women, and who proved very faithful, to lead them with 
their wives, and other conveniences, into their retired cave 
in the wood, and there to bind the two fellows hand ami 
loot, till the} had turther orders. Tiien they opeiietl then 
fences, where they kept their milch goats, and drove them 
all out, giving the go^ls liberty to rumble in the woods, to 
make tlic savages believe that they were wild ones j but tlie 
slave had given a truer information, which made them cumt* 
to the very enclosures. 'The two frighleniHl men sent the 
other slave of the three, who had been with them by acci- 
dent to alarm the Spanianls, and desire their assisUvnee ; in 
tile mean time they took their arms and ammunition, and 
iiiudc to the cave where th< y hud sent their wives, and se- 
curing their slaves, sealed themselves in a private plate, 
from wliencc they might behold all the actions of the savages. 
Nor liud they gone lar, when, aseeuiling a rising ground, 
they cutild see a little army of Indians approach to their 
beautiful dwelling, ami in u few moments more, perceive 
*/ie same, and their furniture, to their unspeakable grief, 
burning in a consuming llame : and when this was dune, 
thev spread liere and there, searching every bush and jilace 
for tiie people, of w bom it was evident they had infurmatioti. 
Upon which the two Englishmen, not thinking ihcinsedves 
secure where tiiey sIocmI, retreated about half a mile higher 
into the coiiiitr}, rightly concluding, that the farther the 
savages strolled, there would be less numbers together : upon 
which they next took llieir stand by the trunk of an old tree 
very hollow and larue, whence they resolvedi to see what 
would offer ; but tlu y lia<l not .stood long there, before two 
savages came runiiiiig directly towards them, as tlK>ugti 
iiiiviug knowledge of their being there, who seemed resolved 
to attack them ; a little farther were three more, and hve 
more behind them again, all running the same way. It 
cannot be imagined the perplexity the poor men wlierc in at 
this sight, thinking that if assistance did not «|)eedily come, 
their cave in the wood would be di.scovered, and consequently 
all therein lost ; .so they resolved to resist them there, and, 
when overpowered, to asciyid to the top of the trees, where 
they might defend themselves as long at their ammunition 
listed, and sell their lives as dear as ]>ossible to those

devouring savages. Thus fifxed in their resolulion, they 
next considered, whether thev should dre at the first two, or 
wait for the three, and so take the middle party, by which 
the twi) first and the five last would be separated. In this 
regulation the two savages also confirmed them, by turning 
a little to another part of the wood ; but the three, and the 
five after them, came directly towards the tree. Hereupon 
they resolved to take them in a direct jine,as they approach- 
ed nearer, because, perhaps, the first shot might hit them all 
three ; and upon this occasion, the man who was to fire, 
charged his piece with three or four bullets. And thus 
while they were waiting, the savages came on ; one of them 
was the imnaway, who h^d caused all the mischier: so they 
resolved he should not escape, if they both fired at once. 
Bui, however, though they did not fire together, they were 
ready charged ; when the first that let fly was too goo<l a 
marksman to miss his aim, for he killed the forniost out- 
right, the second (who was the runaway Indian) fell to the 
ground, being shot through the body, but not dead, and the 
third was a little wounde<l in the shoulder, who sitting 
down on the ground, fell a screaming in a most fearful man- 
ner. The noise of the guns, which not only made the most 
resounding echoes, from one side to the other, but raised 
the birds of all sorts, fluttering with the most confused noise, 
so much terrified the five savages behind, that they stood 
still at first, like so many inanimate images. HutOAben all 
things were in profound silence, they came to the place where 
their companions lay : and here, not being sensible that 
they were (table to the same fate, stood over the wounded 
man, undoubtedly inquiring the occasion of this calamity ; 
and *ti8 as reasonable to suppose, he told them, that it came 
by thunder and lightning from the gods, having never seen 
or heard of a gun before, in the whole course of their lives. 
By this time the Englishmen, having loaded their pieces, 
fired both togetlier a second time, when seeing them all fall 
immediately on the ground, they thought they had kille<l 
every creature of them. This made them come up' boldly 
before they bad charged their guus, which indeerl, was a 
wrong step ; for, when they came to the place, they found 
four alive, two of them very li^le wounded, and one not at 
all, which obliged them to fall upon them with theirjnuskcts ; 
they first knocked the runaway sava§^ cm the head, and 
another that was hut little wounded in the arm, and then

put the other languishing ^retches out oi their pain j while 
he tliat was not hurt, with bended knees aud uplift hands, 
made [)iteou8 moans aud signs to them to spare his life ; 
nor indeed, were they unmerciful to the poor wretch, but 
pointed to him to sit down at the root of a tree hard by ; and 
then one of the Englishmen, with a piece of ropc-twinc he 
had in his pocket by mere chance, tying his ft^el last to- 
gether and his two hands behind him, they left him there, 
making all the haste they could after llie other two, fearing 
they should find out their cave ; but though they could not 
overtake them, they had the satisfaction to perceive (hem 
at a distance cross a \ alley towards the sea, a quite con- 
trary way to their retreat j upon which they returned to the 
tree, to look after their prisoner ; but when they came there 
he was gone, leaving the piece of rope-yarn, wlierew ith he 
was bound, behind him. 

“ Well now lliey were as much concerni'd as ever, as 
not knowing how near their ctietiiies might be, or in what 
numbers. Immediately they repaired to the cave, to see if 
all was well there, and fouml every thing safe, except the 
women wlio were frightened upon their husband's account, 
whom they now loved entirely. They had not been long 
here, before seven of my Spaniards, came to assist them ; 
while the other ten, their servants, and Friday’s, father, were 
gone to defend their bower, corn, and cattle, in case the 
savages should have rambled so far. There accompanied 
the seven Spaniards, one of llie three savages that had for- 
merly been taken prisoner; and with them also that very 
Indian whom the Englishmen had, a little before, left under 
tlie tree ; for, it seems, they passed by that way where the 
slaughter was made, and so carried along with them that 
poor wretch tliat was left bound. But so many prisoners 
now becoming a burden to us, and fearing the dreadful 
consequence of tber escaping, moat of the Spaniards and 
English urged the absolute necessity there was of killing 
them for our common preservation ; but, Sir, the authority 
i bore, as governor, oyer-ruled that piece of cruelty ; and 
then 1 ordered them to lie sent prisoners to the old cave in 
the valley bound hands and feet with two Spaniards to 
guard them. , 

** So much encouraged were the Englishmen at the ap- 
proach of the Spaniards* and so great were their fury agaiiu^t 
the saYages for desiroving their hahil^tiont, that they liad

not patience to stay any longer ; but, taking five Spaniards 
along with them, armed \vith four muskets, a pistol and a 
quarter staft*, away they went in pursuit of their enemies. 
As they passed by the place where the savages were slain, 
it was very easy to be perceived that more of tliem had 
been there, having attempted to carry off their dead bodies, 
but found it impracticable. From a rising ground, our party 
had the mortification to see the smoke that proceeded from 
the rnins when, coming farther in sight of the shore, they 
plainly perceived that the savages had embarked in their 
canoes, and were piitting out to sea. This they were ^ery 
sorrv for, there being no coming at them to give them a 
parting salute ; but, however, they were glad enough to get 
clear of Biich unwelcome guests. 

** Tlius llie two honest, hut unfortunate Englishmen, being 
ruined a second time, and their improvements quite dcstr(»yed, 
most of my good natured Spaniards helped them to rehiiild, 
and we all assisted tliem with needful supplies; nay, what is 
move remarkable their three mischievous countrymen, when 
thev heard of it, (which was afler all tliese disasters were over, 
they living more remote eastward,) very friendly sympathized 
v^fith them, an<l worked for them several days: so that in a 
little time their habitations were rebnilt, their neci‘ssiticB sup- 
plied, and themsebes re^toivd to their former tran(|uillitv. 

“ Though the savages had nothing to boast (d'iii this ad- 
venture, (several canoes being driven ashore, followed !)> 
two drowned creatures, having undonhtedly met with a 
storm at sea, that very night they departed,) yet it was natural 
to be supposed, that those whose better fortune it was to 
attain their native shore, would inflame their nation to 
another ruinous attempt, with a greater force, to carry all 
before them. And, indeed, so it happened : for about seven 
months, after, our island was invaded w ith a most formidable 
navv, no less than eight end twenty canoes full of savages, 
armed with wooden swords, monstrous clubs, bows and 
arrows, and such like instruments of w ar, landing at the east 
end of the island. 

** You may well, Sir, imangine, what consternation onr 
men were in upon this account, and how s|>€edy they were 
to execute their resolution, having only that night's lime 
allowed them. They knew that since they could not with- 
stand tbeir enemies, concealment was the o'nly way to pro- 
cure their safety ; therefore, they took down the hub

that were built for the two Euslishmcn, and drove their 
flock of j^oats, together with their own at the bower, to rile 
old cave in the valley, leaving as little appearance of iu- 
ijabirant as posiiible ; and then posted themselves, with all 
tlieir force, at the plantation of the two men. As they ex- 
pected so it happened ; for early the next morning, the 
Indians, leaving their canoes at the cast-end of the island, 
came l uniiiiig along tjte shore, about two hundred and flfty 
in number, as near as could be guessed. Our army was hut 
little indeed ; and what was our greatest misfortune, we Inul 
not arfiis sullicient for them. 'I'lie account, as to the lueu. 
Sir, is as follows : \ iz. 17 Spaniartls, 5 EnglisUincn, old FrI* 
da>, the three savages taken with the live women, who 
proved faithful servants, and three other slaves, living with 
the Spaniards. To arm these, they had 11 innskels, 5 pis- 
tols, 3 fowling-pieces, 2 swonE, 3 old halberts, r> muskets, 
or fowling-pieces, taken fiom the sailors whom vou reduced. 
As to the slaves, we gave three of them Ijalherts, and tlie 
other, three long staves, with great iron spikes at the end 
oi' (hern, with lialcliets by ibeir sides j we hud also hatchets 
sticking in our girdles, besides the fire arms j nay, two of 
the woman ins[)ire(l with Amazonian ft)rtilude, could m*t 
i)e <liv^lla(le(l from fighting along with their clear liushauds, 
and if they died, to die w itli them. Seeing their resrdution, 
ue gave lliein lialcliets likewise; hut what pleased them 
best were the hows and arrows (w liich the> dexterously knew 
how’ to use; that the Indians had left hehiiid them, after 
their inemorabh* battle one against another. 

“Over lliis anny, which, though little, was of great in- 
Uepiditv, I was constituted chief gtiicial and comniunder ; 
and knowing Will Atkins, tliough exceedingly wicked, vet 
a man of invincible courage, I gave him the power of com- 
manding under me ; he had six men willi their musket44 
loaded with six or seven bullets a j>iecc, and were planted 
just behind a small thicket of bushes, as an advanced guard 
having orders to let the first by ; and then when lie 
fired into the middle of them, make a nimble retreat round 
a part of the wood, and so come in the rear of the Spaniards, 
who were shaded bv a thicket of trees ; for, though the sa- 
vages came on with the fierceness of lions, yet they wanted 
the subtlety of foxes, bciiig*out of all manner of order, and 
straggling in beans every way j and indeed, when Will At- 
kins, after fifty of tlie savages had passed by, liad ordered 



18*2 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

three of his men to give fire, so great was their consterna- 
tion, to see so many men killed and wounded, and hear such 
a dreadful noise, and yet knew not whence it came, that 
they were frightened to the higliest degree ; and when the 
second volley was given, they concluded no less but that 
their companions were slain by thunder and lightning from 
Heaven. In this notion they would have continued, had 
Will Atkins and his meg retired, as soon as they had fired, 
according to order ; or had the rest been near them to pour 
in their shot continually, there might have been a complete 
victory obtained ; but staying to load their pieces, again, 
discovered the whole matter. They were perceived by 
some of the scattering savages at a distance, who let fly their 
arrows among them, wounded Atkins himself, and killed his 
fellow Englishman, and one of the Indians taken with the 
women. Our party did not fail to answer them, and in their 
retreat killed gbout twenty savages. Here 1 cannot but 
take notice of our poor dyings slave, who though stopt from 
his retreat by a fatal arrow, yet with his staff and hatchet 
desperately and gallantly assailed his pursuers, and killed 
five of the savages, before bis life submitted to a multiplicity 
of wounds. Nor is the cruelty or malice of the Indians to 
be less remarked, in breaking the arms, legs, and heads of 
the two dead bodies with their clubs and wooden swords, 
after a must wretched manner. As Atkins retreated our 
party advanced, to interpose between him and the savages ; 
but, after three volleys, we were obliged to retreat also j for 
they were so numerous and desperate, that they came up to 
our very teeth, shot their arrows like a cloud, and their 
wounded men enraged with cruel pain, fought like madmen. 
They did not, however, think fit to follow us, but drawing 
themselves up in a circle, they gave two triumphant shouts in 
token of victory, though they had the grief to see several of 
their wounded men bleed to death before them. 

After 1 had. Sir, drawn up my little army together upon 
a rising ground, Atkins, wounded as he was, would have 
had us attack the wljole body of the savages at once. I 
was extremely well pleased with the gallantry of the man ; 
but, upon consideration, I replied, ** You perceive. Seig- 
nior Atkins, how their wo^uidcd men fight, let them 
alone till morning, when they will be faint, stiff and sore, 
and then we shall have fewer to combat with/ To 
whch Atkins smiling, replied, ** That*s very true, Seig* 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


183 

nior, so shall 1 too ; and that’s the reason I woiil fight them 
now I am warm/' We all answered, Seignior Atkins, for 
your part you ha\e behaved very gallantly ; and if you are 
not able to approach the enemy in the morning, we will 
fight for you, till then we think it convenient to wait, and 
so we tarried. 

** By the brightness of the moon that night, we perceivetl 
the sa\age8 in gn at disordered abaut their dead and wounded 
men. This made us change our resolution, and resolve to 
fall ujron them in the night, if we could give them one vol- 
ley undiscovered. This we hatl a fair opportunity to do, 
by one of the two Englishmen leading us round, between 
the woods and the sea-side westward, and turning short 
south, came privately to a place where the thickest of tliem 
were. Tnlieard and unperceived, eight of us fired among 
them, and did dreadful execution; utid in half a minute 
after, eight more of us let fiv, killing and wounding abitnd- 
ance of them j and then dividing ourselves into three bodies, 
eight persons in each body, we niurclied from among the 
trees, to the very teeth of the enemy, sending forth tlie 
greatest shouts and acclamations. The savages hearing a 
dift'erent noise from three cjiiarteni at once, stood in llie 
utmost confusion ; but coming in sight of us, let fly a volley 
of arrows which wounded poor old Friday, vet happily it 
did not prove mortal. We did not, however, give them a 
second ofiporiunity : but rushing in among them, we fired 
three several ways, and then fell to work with our swords, 
staves, hatchets, and the butt-end of our muskets, with a 
fury not to be resisted ; so that, with the most dismal scream- 
ing and bowline:, they had recourse to their feet, to save their 
lives by a speedy flight. Nor must we forget the valour of 
the two women ; for they exposed themselves to the greatest 
dangers, killed many with their arrows, and valiantly de- 
sitroyed several more with their hatchets. 

“In fighting these two battles, we were so much tired, 
that we did not then trouble ourselves to pursue them to 
their canoes, in which we thought they would presently 
put to the ocean ; but there happening a dreadful storm at 
sea, which continuing all thatnij^t, prevented their 

voyage, but dashed several of their^ats to pieces against 
the beach, and drove the rest so liigfl’iipon the shore, that it 
required infinite labour to get them alT* After our men had 
taken some refreshment and a little Ufote, tliey resolved 



184 


LIFE AND ADVENTURES 


early in the morning to go towards the place of their land- 
ing, and see whether they were gone oif, or in what posture 
tliey remained. This necessarily led them to the place of 
battle, where several of the savages were expiring, A sight 
no way pleasing to generous minds, to delight in misery, 
though obliged to conquer them by the law of arms j but 
our own Indian slaves put them out of their pain, by de- 
apatchiug them with thejir hatchets.^ At length coming in 
view of the remainder of the army, we found them leaning 
upon their kness, which were bended towards their moutli, 
and the head between the two hands. Hereupon, coming 
within musket-shot of them, 1 ordered two pieces to be fired 
without ball, iti order to alarm them, that we might plainly 
know, whether they had the courage to venture another battle, 
or were utterly dispirited from such an attempt, that so we 
might accordingly manage them And, indeed, the project 
U)ok very well ; for, no sooner did the savages hear the first 
gun, and perceive the flash of the second but they suddeuh 
started upon their feet, in the greatest constcrnaliun ; and 
when we a}>proached towards them, they ran howling and 
BCie^ming away uj) the hill into the country. 

“ ^Ve could rather, at first, have wished that the weatlicr 
had permitted them to have gone oft' to the sea ; hut when 
we considered that their escape might occasion the approach 
of multitudes, or our utter ruin and desolation, we were 
very well pleased the contrary happened : Will Atkins 
(who, though w ounded, would not part from us all this while; 
advised us not to let slip this advantage, but clapping be- 
tween them and their boats, deprive them of the capacity 
of ever returning to plague the island: “ 1 know, ^ said he, 
“ there is but one objection you can make, which is, that 
these creatures living like beasts in the wood, may make ex- 
cursions, rifle the plantations, and destroy tlie tame goats -y 
but then, consider, we had better do willi an hundred men, 
whom we can kill, or make slaves of at leisure, than w ith an 
hundred nations, w hom it is impossible we should save our- 
selves from, much less subdue." This advice and these 
argtimeuis being approved of, we set fire to their boats: and 
though they were so wet that we could not burn them en- 
tireU, vet we made them incty>able oi awimmlug in the seas. 
As soon as the Imbans perceived what we were doing, many 
of them ran out of the woods, iu sight of us, and kneeling 
down, piteousU cried out On, Oa, IVaramakva. Intimating, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 185 

1 suppose^ that, if we would but spare their canoes, they 
would never trouble us again. 

“ But all their complaints, submissions and entreaties, 
w^ere in vain ; for self preservation obliging: us to the con- 
trary, we destroyed every one of them that had escaped the 
fury of the ocean, When the Indians perceived this, they 
raised a laiiientable cry;^and ran into the woods, where they 
continued ranging abmit, rnakiiig^the woods ring with their 
lamentations. Here wc should have considered, that making 
these creatures thus desperate, we f)nght, at the same time, 
to have set a sutHcient guard upon the plantations : for the 
savages, in their ranging about, found out the bower, de- 
stroyed tlie fences, trode the corn down under their feet, aiul 
tore up lhe\ines and grapes. It is true, we were always 
able to fight these creatures ; but as tliey were loo swift for 
us, and verv numerous, we durst not go ou! single, for fear 
of them j ihougli that too was needless, they haviug ik> 
weapons, nor any materials to make them : and, indeed, 
their extremity appeared in a little lime after. 

“ Though the savages, as already mentioned, had de- 
stroyed our bower, and all our corn, grapes, <5i'c. yet w« 
had still left our stock of cattle iu the valley, by the cave, 
with some little corn that grew there, and the plantation of 
Will Atkins and his companions, one of whom being killed 
by an arrow', they were now reduced to two : it is remark- 
able that this was the fellow who cut tlic pour Indian with 
hiir hatchet, and hail a design to murder me and my coun- 
trymen the Spaniards. As our condition was so low, 
came to the resolution to drive the savages up t(» the farthef 
part of the island, where no Indians landed > to kill as many 
of them as we could, till we had reduced their number; and 
then fo give tlie remainder some corn to plant, and to teach 
them how' to li\e by tbeir daily labour. Accordingly wb 
pursued tliem with our guns, at tlie hearing of which they 
were so territied, that they would fall to the ground.-— 
Every day we killed and wounded .‘«omc of them, and many 
were found starved to death, so that our hearts began to re- 
lent at the sight of such miserable objects. But at last with 
great didiculty, taking one of them alive, and using him 
with kindness and tt iulerues|i, we brought him to old Fri- 
day, who talking to him and told him how good we would 
be to them all, giving them corn and land to plant, and live 
in, and present nourishment, provided they should keep 



LIFE AND ADVENTURES 


witiiiii such bounds as should be allotted them, and not do 
pixjudice to others: “ Go then'' said he, and inform 
your countrymen of this 3 which, if they will not agree to 
every one of them shall be slain/ 

** Tlie poor creatures, thoroughly humbled, being reduced 
to about thirl} -seven, joyfully accepted the offer, and earn- 
estly begged for food j hereupon we sent twelve Spaniards 
and two Englishmen, well armed, together witli old Friday, 
and three Indian slaves were loaded with a large quantity 
of bread and rice cakes, with three live goats ; and the 
poor Indians being ordered to sit down on the side of the 
hill, they ate the victuals very thankfully, and have proved 
faithful to the last, never trespassing beyond their bounds, 
where at this day they quietly and happily remain, and 
where we now and then visit them. They are confined to 
a neck of land about a mile and a half broad, and three or 
four in length, on the south-east corner of the island, the 
sea being before, and lofty mountains behind them free 
from the appearance of canoes ; and indeed their country- 
men never made any inquiry after them. We gave them 
twelve hatchets, and three or four knives j have taught 
them to build huts, make wooden spades, plant corn, make 
bread, breed tame goats and milk them, as likewise to make 
wicker-work, -in which, I must ingenuously confess, they 
infinitely outdo us, having made themselves several pretty 
necessaries and fancies, as baskets, sieves, birdcages, and 
cupboards, as also stools, beds, and couches, no less useful 
tliau delightful •, and now Uiey live the most innocent and 
moffensive creatures that ever were subdued in the world, 
wanting nothing hut wives to make diem a nation. 

Thus, kind Sir, have I given you, according to my 
ability, an impartial account of the various transactions that 
have happened in Uic island since your departure, to this 
day ; and we have great reason to acknowledge the kind 
providence of Heaven in our merciful deliverance. When 
^ou inspect your little kingdom, you will find in it some 
improvements, your ffocks increased, and your subjects 
augmented, so that from a desolate island, as this was before 
your wonderful deliverance upon it, here is a visible pros- 
p^t of its becoming a popt^ioiis and well governed littll^ 
kingdom, to your Immortal fame and glory 

Thefe is no doubt to suppose but that the preceding re- 
lation of my faithful Spaniard was very agreeable, and no

less surprising to me, to the young priest, and to all who 
hear it : nor were these people less pleased with tho»e 
necessary utensil that I brought them, such as the knives, 
scissors, spades, shovels, and pick-axes, with which they now 
adorned their habitations. 

So much had they addicted themselves to wicker-work, 
prompted by the ingenuity of the Indians, who assisted them, 
that when 1 \it*\ved IhuEiiglishmcu s colonies, they seemed 
at a distance as though they had lived like bees in a hive ; 
for Will Aik ins, who had now become a very industrious 
and sober man, had made himself a tent ot basket-work 
round the outside ; the walls were worked in as a basket, 
in paunels or strong sipiaresof thirty two in number, stand- 
ing about se\en feet high : in the middle was another, not 
above twenty -two paces round, but much si^onger built, 
being of an octagonal form, and in the eight corners stood 
eight strong })osts, round the top of which he laid strong 
pieces, pinned uitli wooden pins, from which he raised a 
j)yramid ft>r the roof, mighty jwetty, I assure you, and joined 
very well logetliei with iron spikes, which he made hiiur 
self, for he had made him a forge, with a pair of wooden 
bellows and charcoal for his work, forming an* anvil out of 
one of the iron crows, to work upon, and in this manner 
would he make himself hooks, staples, spikes, bolts, and 
hinges. After he had pitched the roof of his innermost lent, 
he made it so tirrn between the rafters with basket-work, 
thatching that over again with rice-straw, and over that a 
large leaf of a tree, that his house was as dry as if it had 
been tiled or slated. The outer circuit was covered as a 
lean-to, quite round this inner apartment laying long rafters 
from the thirty-two angles to the lop posts of the inner 
house, about twenty feet distance, so that there was a space 
like a walk between the outer and inner wall, near twenty 
feet in breadth. The inner place he partitioned off with' 
the same wicker-work, dividing it into six neat apartments, 
every one of which had a door, first into the entry of the 
main tent, and another into the space and walk that was 
round it, not onlv convenient for retreat, but for family ne- 
ICessaries. Within the door of the outer circle, there was a 
passage directly to the door^f the inner-house ; on either 
side was a wicker partition, and a door, by which you got 
into a room twenty-two feet wide, and about thirty long. 



188 LIFE AND ADVENTURES, 

and through that into another of a smaller length ; so that in 
the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which 
were only to be come at througli the apartments of the in- 
ner tent, serving as retiring rooms to the respective cham- 
bers of the inner circle, and four large warehouses, which 
went in through one another, two on eitlier hand of the 
passages that led through the outer door to tlic inner tent.— 
In short nothing could b^e built moro ingeniously, kepi more 
neat, or have better conveniences j and here lived the 
til rce families, Will Atkins, his companions, their wives and 
children, and the widow of the deceased. As to religion 
the men seldom taught their wives tiie knowledge of God 
nny more than the sailors’ custom of swearing hy his name. 
Tlie greatest improvement their wives, had, w as they taught 
them to speak English, so as to be understood. 

None of their children where then above six years old : 
they were all fruitful enough, and 1 think the cook’s mate’s 
wife was big of her sixth child. 

When 1 inquired of the Spaniards about their circumstan- 
ces while among tlic savages, they told me, that they aban- 
doned themselves to despair, reckoning themsehes a poor 
mid miserable people, that had no means put into their 
hands, and ooUseqnenlly must soon be starved to death. — 
They owned however thvU they were in the wrong to tliink 
so, and for refusing the assistance that reason oti'eied for 
their support, as well as a future deliverance, confessing that 
grief was a most insignificant passion, as it looked upon 
things as without remedy, and having no hopes of things to 
come } all which verified this noted proverb, 

In trouble to l»e troubled, 

Is to have your trouble doubled. 

Nor did these remarks end here; for, making observa- 
tions upon my improvements, and on my condition at first, 
infinitely worse than ihdir.", he told me that Englishmen had, 
in their distress, greater presence of mind, than tliose of any 
otiier country tliat he had met with ; and that they and the 
Portuguese were the worst of men in the world to struggle 
ondrr misfortunes. When they landed among the savages, 
they found but little provision, except they would turn can- 
nibals, there being bi^t a few roots and herbs, with little sub- 
staiu e in them, and of which the natives gave them but very

; iparingly. Many were the ways they took to civilixe and 
teach the savages, but in vain ; for tiiey would not own 
{them to be llieir instructcrs, whose lives were owing to 
|their bounty. Their extremcties were very great, being 
many clays entirely without food, the savages there being 
more iiulol(>nt and less devouring than those who had better 
i supplies. When they went out to battle, they, were obliged 
« to assist thi se people, in one of wliicli my faithful Spaniard 
being taken, had like to have been devoured. Tlicy had 
lost their aninninition, which rendered their tire^arms use- 
less : nor could they use the bows and arrows that wcie 
given them, so that while the* aiinies were at a distance 
they had no chance, but when close, then they could be of 
service with halbeils, and sharpened sticks put iulo the 
muzzles of their muskets. They made themseUcs targets 
of wood, covered with the skins of wild beasts; and when 
one bappone d to be knocked down, tlie rest ot the com- 
jHiny fought over liim till he recovered ; and then standing 
dose in a line they woidd make their way through a thousand 
savages. At the return of tin ir friemls, who they thought 
had been entombed in the bowels of their enemies, their joy 
was inconceivable. Nor were they less surprised at tlie 
sight of the loaves of bread I had sent them, things that they 
had not seen for several \ears, at the same time crossing 
and blessing it, as though it was manna sent from Heaven: 
but when thev knew the errand, and perceived the boat which 
was to carry them to the person and place from whence such 
relief came, this struck them vvilfi such a surpri^e o( joy 
as made some of them faint away, and others burst out 
into tears. 

This was the summary account that I bad from them.— 

1 shall now inform the reader what I next ditl for them, and 
in what condition I left tbein. .As we were all of opinion 
that as the savages would scarce trouble them any more, wo 
we ha<l no apprehensioui on that score. 1 told him I was 
come purely to exitablish, and not U> remove them ; and 
upon lhat occasion, bad not only brought them necessaries 
for co.Tvenience and defence, but also artificers, and other 
per^iiis, both for tlie necfcs|ary eniplo 3 mcut», and to add 
to their number. They were all together when i thus talked 
to them and before I delivered to him the ttores I brought, 

1 asked them one by one, if they had eutlrely forgot their 



idO LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

first animosities, would engage in the strictest friendship, 
and shake hands with one another? On this Will Atkins, 
with abundance of good humour, said, they had afflictions 
enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough to 
make them all friends : as for himself he would live and 
die among them, owning that what the Spaniard had done 
to him, his ownjnad humour had made necessary for them 
to do. Nor had the Spaniards occasion to justify their pro- 
ceedings to me: but they told me that since Will Atkins 
had behaved himself so valiantly in fight, and at other times 
showed such a regard to the common interest of them all, 
they had not only forgotten all that was past, but thought 
he ought as much to be trusted with arms and necessaries 
as any of them, which they testified by making him neXt in 
command to the governor : and they most heartily embraced 
the occasions of giving me this solemn assurance, that they 
would never separate their interest again as long as they lived. 
After these kind declarations of friendship, we appointed 
all of us to dine together the next day ) upon this 1 caused 
the ship’s cook and his mate to come on shore, for that pur- 
pose, to assist in dressing our dinner. We brought from 
the ship six pieces of beef, and four of pork, together with 
our punch-howl, and materials to fill it ; and in particular I 
gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten of English 
beer, which was very acceptable to them, The Spaniards 
added to our feast five whole kids, which being roasted, 
three of them were sent as fresh meat to the sailors on board, 
and the other two we ate ourselves. After our merry and 
innocent feast was over, I began to distribute my cargo 
among them. First, 1 gave them linen suffleient to make 
every one of them four shirts, and at the Spaniard’s request 
made them up six. The thin English stuff I allotted to 
make every one a light .coat like a frock, agreeable to the 
climate, and left them such a quantity as to make more up on 
their decay : as also pumps, shoes, hats and stockings. It 
is not to be expressed the pleasing satisfactian which sat 
upon the countenances of these poor men, when they per- 
ceived what care 1 took of them, as if I had been a common 
father to them all j and they all engaged never to leave the 
island, till I gave my consent for their departure. 1 then 
presented to them the people I brought, viz, the tailor, 
smith, and the two carpenters ; but my Jack-of-aU-Trades 
was the most acceptable present 1 could make them. My 



OF ROBINSON CRt’SOE. 101 

tailor fell immediately to work, and made every one of them 
a shirt ; after which, he learned the women how to »ew and 
stick, thereby to become more helpful tb their husbands* 
Neither were the carpenters less useful, taking in pieces their 
clumsy things ; instead of which they made convenient and 
handsome tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, and 
shelves. But when I carried thi?m to see Will Atkins's 
basket-house, they owned they never saw such a piece of 
natural ingenuity before : “ I am sure,** said one of the car- 
penters, “ the man that built this, has no need of us j you 
need. Sir, do nothing but give him tools.** 

1 divided the tools among them in this manner: to every 
man I gave a dij^giugf spade, a shovel, and a rake, as having 
no harrow or ploughs ; and to every separate place a pick- 
axe, a crow, a broad axe, and a saw, w ith a store for a general 
supply, should any be broken or worn out. 1 left them also 
nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chissels, knives, scissors, and 
all sorts of tools and iron work ; and for the use of tlic 
smith, gave them three tons of unvvrought iron, for a sup- 
ply ; and as to arms and ammunition, I stored them even to 
profusion j or, at least, to ecpiip a sufbcicut little army 
against all opposers whatsoever. 

, The young man (whose mother was unfortunately starved 
to death) together with the maid, a pious and well-educated 
young woman, seeing things so well ordered on shore, (for 
I made them accompany me,) and considering (hey had do 
occasion to go so far a voyage as to the East-Indics, they 
both desired of me, that 1 would leave them there, and 
enter them among my subjects. This 1 readily agreed to, 
ordering them a plat of ground, on wliich were three little, 
houses errecl<*d, environed with basket-work pallisadoed 
like Atkins's and adjoining to his plantation. So contrived 
were their tents, tiiat each of them had a room apart to 
lodge in, while their middle tent was not €)idy their store- 
house, but their place for eating and drinkifij^. At this 
time the two Englishmen removed their habitation to their 
former place ; so that now the island was divided into three 
colonies: first. Those I have just now mentioned; secondly, 
'fhat of Will Atkins, whesc there were four families of 
Englishmen, witli their wives and children, the widow and 
her children ; the young man and the maid, who bjr the 
way, we made a wife of before our departure ; three sa- 
vages, who were slaves; the tailor, smith, (who served also 



192 


LIFE AND ADVENTURES 


as a gunsmith,) and my other celebrated person called Jack- 
af-all-tra(Jes : Thirdly, my chief colony, which consisted of 
the Spaniards with old Friday, who still remained at my 
old habitation, w Inch was my capital city ; and surely never 
was there such a metropolis, it being now hid in so obscure 
a groVe, that a thousand men might have ranged the island 
a month, and looked purposely for it, without being able to 
find it, though the Spaniards had enlarged its boundaries, 
both without and within, in a most surprising manner. 

But now 1 think it high time to s})oak of the young French 
priest, of the order of St. Benedicf, whose judicious and pious 
discourse, upon sundry occasions, merit an extraordinary 
observation j nor can his being a French Pa]>ist priest, I pre- 
sume, give otfcnce to any of in\ rcadors, when they have 
this assurance from me, that he was a person of a most 
courteous, disposition, extensi\e charity, and exalted piety. 
Flis arguments were always agreeable to reason, and his 
conversation the most acceptable of any person that I had 
ever yet met w iih in my life. 

** Sir/’ said he to me one day, since, under God,’’ 
at the same time crosving his breast, “ you have not only 
saved my life ; hut by permitting me to go this voyage, 
have granted me tlw happiness of free conversation, I 
think it my duty, as my ])iy)fe>sion obliges me, to save 
what souls 1 can, by bringing them to the knowledge of 
some catholic doctrine, necessary to salvation: and since 
these people arc und» r your immediate government, in 
gratitude, justice, and decency, for what you have done 
for me, 1 shall otfer no farther points in religion, than 
what merit.s your approbation.” Being pleased with the 
modesty of his carriage, 1 told him he should not be worse 
used for being of a different persuasion, if upon that very 
account we did not differ in points of faith, not decent in 
a part of the country where the poor Indians ought to be 
instructed in the knowledge of the true God, and his Son 
Jesus Christ. To this he replied, that conversation might 
easily be separated from disputes ; that he would discourse 
with me rather as a gentleman, than on religion : but 
if we did enter upon religious arguments upon my desking 
the same, I would give him hbertv to defend his own pritt- 
dples. He farther added, that he would do all that became 
him in his office, as a priest as wdli as a Christian, to pro- 
cure tfie happiness of all that were in the ship : that though

he could not pra^ with, he wtmhi prav for us on alt occa- 
sions ; and then he told me several extraordinary events of 
his life, within a few vears past ; but particularly in this 
last, wiiieli was tlie most remarkable: that in tills voyage^ 
he had the misfortune to be live times shipped and unshipped; 
bis first desi^rn was to have ^one to Martinieo ; for which 
taking sliiji at St. Maloes, he was forced into Lisbon by bad 
weather, the vessel ruuniiig a-ground in the mouth of the 
'ragus j that from tlience he went on board a Portuguese 
ship, bound to tin; Mudeiias, w hose master being but an in- 
dirterent manner, and out of his reckoning, they were drove 
to Fial, where ;3elling tlieir commodity, which was corn, they 
resolved to take in tlieir loading at the Isle of May, and to 
sail to Newfoundland : at the Hanks of which, meeting a 
French ship bound to Quebec, in the river of Canada, and 
from thence to Martinieo, in this ship he embarked ; the 
master of which <lying at (Quebec, that voyage wan mu»- 
pended ; and lastly sliijiped himself for France, this tail 
sliipvvas destroved h\ tire, as before has been related. 

At this lime we talked no further but another morning 
he comes to me, just as 1 was going to visit the Lnglish- 
men’s eolonv, and tells me, that as he knew the prosperity 
ol’ the island was my principal lie^ire, he had sometliing to 
communicate agreeable to my design, by which perhaps be 
might put it, more than he yet thought it was, in the way 
of the hcHcdiction of Heaven. “ How, Sir !” said 1, in a 
surprise, “arc we not yet in the way of hiessinga^ 

after all these signal piovidences and deliverances, of whicb 
you have had such an ample relation^ He replied, “ I hope^ 
Sir, you are in the wav, and that your good denigii will 
prosper: hut still tliere are some among you tllftt are not 
equally riglit in their actions ; and remember, 1 beaeech 
you, Sir, that Achan, by his crime, removed God’a bleii»iiig 
from the camp of tiie children of Israel ; that though six 
and thirty were entirely innocent, yet they became the ot»- 
iectsof Divine vengeance, and bore the weight of his punish- 
ment accordingly.'’ 

So sensible was I touched with his discourse, and so sa- 
tisfied with that ardent piety that inflamed hts soul, that 1 
desired him to accurnpaiiy to the Eiigltshmen's plantar 
lions, which he was very glad of, by reason they were tlic 
suldect of what he designed to discourse wilii me about : 
ana while we walked on together, he began ia the follow* 
ing manner :

UFE AND ADVENTURES 


<< Sir, said he, I must confess it as a great unhappiness 
that we disagree in several doctrinal articles of religion ; but 
aurely both of us acknowledge this, that there is a God, 
who having given us some stated rules for our service and 
obedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend 
him } either by neglecting what he has commanded, or by 
doing what he has forbidden. This truth every Christian 
owns, that when any one* presumptuously sins against God’s 
command, the Almighty then withdraws his blessing from 
him ; every good man therefore ought certainly to prevent 
such neglect of, or sin against, God and his commands. I 
thanked the young priest for expressing so great a concern 
for us, and desired him to explain the particulars of what 
he had observed, that according to the parable of Achan, I 
“ might remove the accursed thing from among us.” “ Why 
then, Sir, said he, in the first place, you have four English- 
men, who have taken savage women to their wives, by 
whom they have sev eral children, though none of them are 
legally married, as the law of (iod, and man.requires ^ they, 
1 say, Sir, arc no less than adulterers, and as they still live 
ill adultery, arc liable to the' curse of God. 1 know, Sir, 
you may object the want of a priest, or clergyman of any 
kind j as also, pen, ink, and pai>cr, to write down a con- 
tact of marriage, and have it signed between them. But 
neither this nor what the Spani.sh governor has told you of 
their choosing by cons< nt, can be reckoned a marriage, nor 
any more than 5;n agn emeiil to keep them from quarreling 
among themselves : tor, Sir, the essence in sacrament of 
matrimony (so lie called it) not only consists in mutual con- 
•ent, but in the legal obligation which compels them to 
own and acknowledge one another, to abstain from other 
persons, the men to provide for their w ives and children, 
and ilte w oman to the same and like conditions, mutatis mu- 
tandis, oil their side ; whereas, Sir, these men, upon their 
own pleasure, uu any occasion may forsake those wom^n, 
and marry otlicrs, and by disowning their children, suffer 
them utterly to perish. Now, Sir, added he,^“ can 
God be honoured iu such an unlawful liberty as this ? how 
can a blessing succeed to the best endeavours, if men are 
allowed to live in so licefttioaa iiway T’ I was indeed struck 
with the thiag myself, and thought that they were much to 
blame, that aio fomial contract had been made, though it 
liad been but breaking a stick between them, to engage

them to live as man and wife, never to separate, but love, 
cherish, and comfort one anotiicr all their lives, Yel 
Sir,'’ said 1, “ when they look these women, 1 was not here ; 
and if it is adullery, it is past my remedy, and 1 cannot help 
it/’ “ True, Sir,” answereii the young priest, you can- 
not be charged with that part of their crime which was done 
in }our absence : but I beseech you don't Hatter yourself, 
that vou are under no obligation now to put a period to it: 
which if you neglect to do, the guilt will be entirely on you 
alone, since it is certainly in nobody’s power but yours, to 
alter their condition.” 1 must confess I was so dull, that ! 
thought he meant 1 should part them, and knowing that 
this would put the wliole island in confusion, I toW him I 
could not consent to it upon any account whatsoever. “ ^Si^,’' 
said he, in great surprise, “ I do not mean that you should 
separate, but marry them, by a written contract, signed by 
both man and woman, and by ail the witnesses present, 
which all the European laws decree to be of sutbcient effi- 
cacy/ Amazed with such true piety and sincerity, and 
<t>ni»Kin'iiiir the validity of a written contract, 1 acknowledged 
all that he said to be \ery just and kind, and that I would 
discourse w itli the men about it ; neither could 1 see what 
reason they could liave not tc» let him marry them, whose 
authority in that affair is owned to be as authentic as if they 
were married by any of our clergy men in England. 

The uext complaint he had to make to nx* was this, that 
though these English subjects of mine have lived with these 
women seven years, and though they were of good under- 
.standing, and capable of instruction, having learned not 
only to speak, but to read English, yet all this while they 
had never taught them any thing of the Christian religion, 
or the knowledge, of fiod, much less in what manner he 
ought to be served. “ And is not ibis an unaccountable 
neglect?” said he warmly; “Depend upon, it, (iod Al- 
mighty will call them to account for such contempt. And 
though 1 am not of your religion, yet I should be glad to 
jope these people released from the devil’s power, and be 
saved by the principles of the Christian religion, the know- 
ledge of God, of a Redeemer, the resurrec‘tioii, and of a 
future state. But as it isoof tob late, if you please to give 
roe leave to instruct them, I doubt not but 1 shall supply 
this great defect, by bringing them into the great circle of 
Christianity, even while you continue in the island.

i could lioid no longer, but embracing Iiim told, him, 
with a liiousand thanks, 1 would grant whatever lie request- 
ed, and desired him to proceed in the third article, which 
he did in the following manner: 

“ Sir,’' haid he, “ it should be a maxim among all Chris- 
tians, that Christian knowledge ought to be propagated 
by all possible means, and on all occasions. Upon this 
account our church sends missionaries into Persia, India, and 
China, men who are willing to die for the sake of God and 
the Christian faith, in order to bring poor inhdels into the 
way of salvation. Now, Sir, as here is an opportunity to 
convert seven and thirty poor savages, I wonder how you 
can pass by such an occasion of doing good, which is really 
worth the expence of a mans whole life. ’’ 

I must confess 1 was so confounded at this discourse, that 
1 could not tell how to answer him. Sir” said he, seeing 
me in disorder, I shall be very sorry if 1 have given you 
offence.” “ No Sir,” said I, I am rather confounded j 
and you know my circumstances that being bound to the 
East-Indies in a merchant ship, I cannot wrong the owners 
so much, as to detain the ship here, the men laying at vic- 
tuals and wages on their account. If 1 stay above twelve 
days 1 must pay 3/. sterling per diem demurrage, nor must 
the ship stop above eight days more ; so that I am unable 
to engage in this work, unless I would leave the ship, and 
be reduced to my former condition.” The jiriest, though 
he owned this was hard upon me, yet laid it to my con- 
science, whether the blessing of saving seven and thirty 
souls was not worth venturing all that I liad in the world V 
** Sir,” said 1, it is very true : but as you are an ecclesias- 
tic, it naturally falls into your profession ; why therefore, 
don’t you rather offer to undertake it yourself, than, press 
me to it? upon this he turned about, making a very' low 
l>ow', “ I most humbly thank God and you, Sir, (said he,) 
for so blessed a call ; and most willingly undertake so glo- 
rious an oftice, which will sufficiently compensate all the 
hazards and difficulties I have gone tiurough in along and 
uneomfortable voyage. 

While he was thus speaking, I could discover a rapture 
in his face, by his colour going and coming ; at tlie same 
time his eyes sparkled like tire, and all the signs of the 
most zealous transports. And when I asked whether he 
was in earnest ? Sir,” said he, “ it wias to preach to the

Tndinns 1 consefited to come along: with you ; these inhdels, 
even in this little island, are intinitely of more worth than 
my |K*»or life : if so that I should prove the happy instrument 
of savin" these poor creatures souls I care not if I never 
see my native country attain. One thine: I only liejr of you 
more is, that >ou would leave Friday with me, to he inv 
interpreter, without whose assistance neither of ns will 
understand each othcf.” • 

This reijiiest verv sensibly troubletl me: first upon Fri 
day’s heirii!; bred a Frotestant ; and, secondly, for the af- 
fection 1 bore to him for his fidelity : But immediately the 
remembrance of Friday's lather corning into my hea<l, I re- 
commended him to him as having learned Spanish, vvhicli 
the priest also understood ; and so was tlioronjfhly satistied 
with him. 

When we came to the Kni»Ii<hmen. after I had told them 
what neccs.sarv things I liad done for iImmu, I taikiMl to them 
of the scandalous life theN led ; told them what notice the 
cltTcyrnan lia<i taken oi it, and asked them if they were 
mariied men or hachelofN ^ They answered, two of ihenr 
were widower-j, and the other three siuijle men. But said 
I, v^ith what conscience can you cull these year wives, hy 
whom you have so many children, and yet arc not lawfully 
married * They all said, that they took them before the 
(lovernor, as such, nobody else to marry them, which 

they thouuht as le^^al, as if they hud had a parson. No 
doubt, said I, but in tin* eye of (tod it is so: but nnleifs 1 
am assured of your honest intent, nev»*r to desert these poor 
creatures, I can do nolhiiiii; more for you, neither can you 
expect (iod’s blessing whih* you live in such an open cour»e 
of adultery. Hereupon Will Atkins, who spoke for the rent, 
told me, that fliey behoved their wives the most innocent 
and’ virtuous crealure'i in I lie world ; that ihev would never 
forsake them while they had breath; and that if there was 
a clerirymaii in the shif>, they would be married to them 
with all liieir hearts. 1 told you before, said I, that I have 
a minister with me, who shall marry you to-morrow morn- 
ing, if you are willing; .ho I would haye you consult to- 
night with the rest about it. I told him the clergyman was 
a Frenchman, and knew iioU a word of English, but that 1 
would act as a clerk between them. And indeed this buii- 
neaa met with such speedy success, that they all told me 



198 LIFE AND ADVENTURED 

ill a few minutes after, that they were ready to be formally 
married, as soon as 1 pleased ; with which informing the 
priest, he was exceedingly rejoiced. 

Nothing now remained ; but that the women should be 
made sensible of the meaning of the thing; with which be- 
ing well satisfied, they, with their husbands, attended at my 
appartment the next morning ; there was my priest, habited 
in a black vest, something like a cassock with a sash round 
it, much resembling a minister, and I was his interpreter. 
But the seriousness of his behaviour, and the scruples he 
made of marrying the women who were not baptized, gave 
them an exceeding reverence for his person; nor, imleed 
would he many lli in at all, till he obtained my libery to 
discourse both with the men and women, and then he told 
them, That in the sight of all indifferent men, and in the 
sense of the law s of society, they had lived in open adultery, 
which nothing now, hut their consent to marry, or final 
separation, could j>ut an end to ; and even here was a ditH- 
eulty with respect to the laws of Cliristian matrimony, in 
inarrying a professed Christian to a heathen idolater, un- 
haptized ; but yet there was time enough to make them 
profess the name of Christ, without which nothing could be, 
done; that, besides, he believed they were very indifferent 
(Christians: and consequently had not discourseef with their 
wives u[>on the subject; and that unless they promised 
him to do so, he could not marry them, as being expressly 
forbidden by the laws of God. 

All this they had heard attentively, and owned readily. 

“ But, Lord, Sir,” ^aid Will Atkins to me, “ how should 
we teach tliem religion, w ho know nothing of it ourselves ? 
How can we talk to our wives of GikI, Jesus Christ, hea- 
ven and heir^ why they would only laugh at us, who never 
yet have practised religion, but on the contrary all manner 
of w ickedness.” “ Will Atkins,” said I, “ cannot you tell 
your wife she is in the wrong, and that her gods are idols, 
which can neither speak nor understand ; but that our God, 
who has made, can destroy all things ; that he rewards the 
pood and punishes the wicked ; and at last will bring us to 
judgment ( cannot you tell her these things r “ That’s 
true,” said Will Atkins, ** but iben sbell tell me it is utterly 
false, since 1 am not punished and sent to the devil, who 
liAth been such a wickgd creature.” These words i inter- 
preted to the priest. “ Oh !” said he, “ tell him, his repent-

mice will make him a verv good minister to his spouse and 
qualify him to preach on the merev and lon«-surt’eriug of a 
merciful Being, who desire^ not the death of a sinner,' and 
even delers daninatiou to the last judgment ; this wdl lead 
iiim to the doctrine of the resurrection, and will make him 
ail excellent preacher to bis wife.” 1 re[)eated this to Atkins, 
who being more than ordinarily alfectcMl witJi it, replied, 
“ I know all this, Sir„and a greaj deal more: but how can 
I ha^e the impudence to talk thus to my uife, when my 
conscience witnesses against me V' Alas !'* saiil he, (with 
l(‘ars \i\ his e>es, and gi\iiiga great sigh.)'* as for repenting, 
that is forever [last me." “Past \ou ! Atkins,” said i 
“ uhal do you mean “ \ ou know well enough,” said he. 
what 1 mean ; I mean it is to lat.\ ' 

When 1 told the priest what he said, the poor altecti<nuitc 
mail could not refrain from wrrjiiug ; hut recoveriug 
Iniuself, “ Pray, Sir,” said he, “ -ok iniii it he is contented 
that it is too late ; or is he cone cun d, and wishes it were 
not so?’ Tills <|uestion I put fairiv to Atkins, who replied 
in a passion, “ I low can I Ik* easy in a state which I know 
must terminate in iny ruin ? for I really believe, some time 
or other, 1 shall cut my throat, to put a period botli to my 
life, and to the terrors of rny conscience.’* 

At ibis the clcrgyruaii shook his head : Sir,” said he,

llien parted from us to walk with hi.s wife, while we dis- 
coursed with the rest. But these were very stupid in reli- 
gious matters : yet all of them promised to do their endea- 
vours to make their wives turn Chii''lians: ami upon which 
promises the priest married the three couple. But as Air 
kins was the only .sincere convert, and of more sense tlmii 
the rest, my clergyman was earnej»lly enquiring after him; 
“ Sir,*' said he, “ let us walk out of this labyrinth, and I 
dare say we shall find this poor man preaching to hb wife 
already.” And indeed we fqund it true ; for coming to the

he pointed to the sun, to th^ quarters of the earth, to himself, 
to her, the woods, and the trees. Immediately we could 
perceive him start upon his feet, fall down upon his knees, 
and lift up both his hands j at which the tears ran down my 
clcrgyinan’s cheeks j but our great misfortune was, we 
could not hear one word, that passed between them. Ano- 
ther lime he would embrace her, wiping the tears from her 
eyes, kissing her with the. greatest transports, and then both 
knee l down for some minutes together. Such raptures of 
joy did this occasion in rny young priest, that he could 
scarcely contain himself: And a little after this we observed 
by her motion, as frequently lifting up her hands, and laying 
them on her breast, that she was mightily effected with 
hif discourse, and so they withdrew' from our sight. 

When we came hack we found them both waiting to be 
called in ; upon which wc agi«‘< d to examine him alone, and

wh6 was mightily concerned he could not talk to her himself ; 
“ Sir,” said he, ** there is something more to be done to 
chis woman than to marry her ; I mean that she oui;ht to 
be baptized.” To this I presen My agreed : Pray,” said 

he, “ ask her husband, whether he has ever talked to her ot 
Jesus Christ, the salvation of sinners, the nature of faltli, and 
redemption in and by him, and of the Holy Spirit, the rt sur- 
rectioii, last judgment, and a future state but the poor 
fellow melted into tears at tliis question, savifig that he had 
said something to her of these things, but bis inability to 
talk of them, made him afraid, lest her k^ov^ ledge of them 
should rather make her contemn religion, than he bem'tited 
by it ; but that if I would discourse with her, it would be 
very evident my labour would not be iii \aiu. Accord- 
ingly 1 called her in, and t>lacing my‘<('lf as interpreter be- 
tween the religious priest and the woman, 1 ( iitreated him to 
to go on ; hut surely never was such a serinou preached hy 
any clergyman in these latter days, with so much zeal, know- 
ledge and sincerify : in short, he brought the woman to 
embrace the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption hy 
ijirn, with so surprising a degree of understanding, that she 
made it her own request to be baptized. 

He then performecl liis otlice in the sacrament of baptism, 
first, by sming some wnrils over to himself in Latin, and 
then asking me to give her a name, as heing her godfather j 
and pouring a whole dishful of water upon the woman’s 
head he said, “ Mari/, I baptize liie in ilie name of the 
Father, and of the Son. and of tlic Holy (ihost so that 
none eould know of what religion he was. After this he 
pronounced the benediction in Latin. Thus the woman 
being made a (Uiristian, lie married her to Will Atkins : 
which being finished, he aflVctionately exhorted him to 
lead a holy life for the future : and since the Almighty, for 
the convictions of his coii.scieiice, had honoured him to be 
the instrument of his wife’s conversion, he should not dis- 
honour the grace of (lod, that while the savage was con- 
verted, the instrument should he cast away. Thus ended a 
ceremony, to me the most pleasant and agreeable 1 ever 
passed in my life. 

The affairs of the island being settled, I was preparing to 
go on board, when the young ^la^l (whose mother was starv- 
ed) came to me, saying, that as he understood 1 bad a cler- 
gyman with me, who had married the Englishmen with 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 


m 

savages, he had a match to make between two Christian* 

which he desired might be finished before 1 departed. 

Thinking that it was he himself that had courted iiis mothet's 
maid, I persuaded him not to do any thing rashly upon the 
account of his solitary ctrcurnstaiices ; that the maid was an 
unequal match for iiim, both in respect to substance and 
years ; and that it was ver\ probable he would live to re- 
turn to his own country, where he might ha\e a far heller 
choice. At tliese wf)i ds, .smiling, *he iiiterruptt'il me, thank- 
ing me for my good advice ; that a.s he had nolhing to beg 
of me hut a small settlement, with a servant or twi>, or some 
few' necessaries, so he hoped I would not be unmiiniful of 
him when I retiinnd to Kiiglatid, h\it give his letter to his 
friends; and that when lie was redeemed, (he plaiitatiiiii, 
and all its improvements, however valuable, sliould be re 
turned to me a'gain. Ihit as for the niarriag»‘ fie proposed, 
llial it was not liimsflf, but that it was between ni) Jack-of 
all trades and tin* maid Susan. 

1 was indeed agreeablv surprised at the mentioning this 
match, which seemed very suitable, the one being a %'ery 
ingenious fellow, and the other an excellent, dexterous, and 
sensible housewife, fit t<» be governess of the whole island: 
so we married the same day ; and ai 1 was her father 

and gave her away, so I gave her a hamlsome portion, ap- 
pointing Iht and her husband a convenient large spot of 
ground for their plantation. The sliaring out of the land I 
left to Wdl Atkins who reallv divided it very justly to 
ev€rv jmrson's satisfac tion, they only desin ti one general 
writing under m\ baud for the winde, which I c aused to he 
drawn up, signed, and sealed to them, setting out iheii 
bounds, and giving them a right to the whole possession cd 
their respective plantations, with their improvenieiiU, to 
them and their heirs, reserving all the re.st of the i.slaiid ai 
my own property, and a certain rent for every particular 
plantation, after eleven >ears. As to their laws and go- 
vernment, ] exhorttsl them to love on another ; and a» to 
the Indians who lived in a nook by themselves, 1 allotted 
three or four of them plantations, and the rest wullingly 
chose to become servants to the other families, by which 
means they were emploved in us<*ful labour, and fared 
much better than they did before. IWsides the savages be- 
ing thus mixed w ith the Christians, the work of their con- 
version might be set on foot by the latter, in the clergy-

man’s absence, to our equal satisfaction. The young priest, 
however, was a little anxious lest the Christians should not 
be willing to do their parts in instructing, these poor Indi- 
hns ; 1 therefore told him we should call them all togetlier j 
that he should speak to the Spaniards who were Papists, 
and I to the English who were Protestants, and make them 
promise that they would never make any distinction in re- 
ligion, but teach the general true knowledge of God, and 
his vSon Jesus Christ, in order to convert the poor savages. 
And this, indeed they all promised us accordingly. 

When I came to Will Atkins’s house, I found his baptized 
wife, and the young woman newly married to my Jack-of- 
all-trades, \vere become great intimates, and discoursing of 
religion together. O, Sir,” says Will Atkins, ‘‘ when 
God lias sinners to reconcile to himself, he never wants an 
instrucler; I knew^ 1 was unworthy of so good a work, and 
therefore thb young woman has been sent hither as it were 
from heaven, who is sutheient to convert a whole nation of 
savages.” The voung woman blushed, and was going to 
rise j but 1 desired lier to sit still, and hoped licit God 
would bless her in so good a work; and then pulling out 
a Bible, (w hich I brought on purpose in iny pocket Ibr liim,) 
“ Here Atkins,” said 1, “ here is an assistant that jxnhaps 
><)u had not before.” So coidbunded was th(‘ jioor man, 
that it was some time before lie couKl .s}>eak ; at last tnruing 
to his wife, “ IM / dear/' said he, “ did I not tell vou tiiat 
God could hear what we said ? Herr's the f>o()k 1 prayed 
for, when ^ou and I kneeled under the hush ; God then 
heard us, and iiow^ as sent it.” Tiie woman was surprised, 
and thought really God had .sent that individual hook fr<»m 
lieaven ; hut 1 turned to the young woman, and desired her 
to e\j>lain to llu‘\oung cuu\eil,lhat God may properly he 
said to answer our petitions, when, in the course of his jiro- 
vidence, such parlieular things eume to pass as we pelition- 
etl for. This the young woman did effectually; hut surely 
Will Atkins’s jov cannot he e\j>rcsscd ; no man being more 
thankful for any thing in the woriil, than he was for his 
Bible, nor desired it frutn a better {)riiicipal. 

.After se\eral religious <liscourses 1 desired the voung 
woman to give me an account, of the anguish she felt when 
she was starving to death with hunger; to wliich she readily 
consented, and began in the following manner ; 

** Sir/’ said slie, all our victuals being gone, after I had 
fasted one day, my stomach was very sickly, and, at the ap-

proacli of mglit, I was inclined to yawning and sleepy. 

When I liad slept on tlie couch three hours, 1 awaked a lit- 
tle refreshed : lliree hours after, my stomach being more 
and more sickly, 1 lay down again, but could not sleep, be- 
ing very fiiml and ill. Thus 1 passed the second day with 
a strange variety, first hungry, then sick again, with retch- 
ings to \oniit j that night I dreazn'd I was at Barbadoes, 
bu\ing pleutv of provisions, and dined heartily. But when 
I awakened ni\ spirits were exceedingly sunk, to find myself 
in the extremity of famine. There was but one glass of 
wine, which being mixed with sugar, 1 drank up ; but for 
want of suh>tanec to digest upon, the fumes of it got into 
m\ head, and ma<le me senseless for some tiirn*. The third 
da\ I wav so ravenous and furious, that I could have eaten 
a little child if it liad come in iny way ; during which time 
1 was mad as anv creature in Bedlam, lii one of these

208 


LIFE AND ADVENTURES 


Surely never was a more distinct account c f starving to 
death than tliis. But to return to the disposition of things 
among my people, I did not take any notice to them of the 
sloop that I had framed, neither would 1 leave them the 
two pieces of brass cannon, or the two quarter-deck guns 
that I had on hoard, lest upon any disgust they, should have 
separated, or turned pirates, and so make the island a den 
of thieves, instead of a, plantation of sober, pious people : 
but leaving them in a flourishing condition, with a promise 
to send them further relief from Brazil, as sheep, hogs, and 
cows, (being obliged to kill the latter at sea, having no hav 
to feed them,) 1 went on board the ship again, the first ot 
May, IfiOo, after having been twenty days among them . 
and next morning, giving them a salute of five guns at 
parting, we set sail for the Brazils. Tlie third day, towards 
evening, there happening a calm, and the current being 
very strong, we were drove to the N. N. K. towards the 
land. Some hours after we perceived the sea covered 
as it were with something very black, not easily at first to 
be discovered: upon which onr chief mate ascending the 
shrouds a little way, and taking a \ iew' w it li the perspec- 
tive glass, he cries out, “ An army ! an army ! ’ You 
fool,” said 1, “ what do yon mean “ Nay, Sir,” said he, 
“ don’t be angry, I assure you it is not only an army, but a 
fleet too, for 1 believe there are a thousand canoes paddling 
along, and making with great haste towards us.” 

Indeed every one of ns were surprised at this relation; 
and my nephew', the captain, could not tell what to think 
ol it, hut thought we should all be devoured. Nor was I 
free from concern, when I considered how much we were 
becalmed, and what a strong cuiTeiit set towards the shore, 
however, 1 encouraged him not to be afraid, but bring the 
ship to an anchor, as soon as we were certain that we must 
engage them. Accordingly we did so, and furled all onr 
sails ; as to the savages we feared nothing, but only that 
they might set the ship on fire; to prevent which, I ordered 
them to get their boats, out, and fasten them one close bv the 
liead, and another by (he stern, well manned, with skeetsand 
buckets to extinguish the flames, should it so liappen. The 
savages soon came up with «is, but there was not so many 
as the mate had said, for instead of a thousand canoes there 
were only one hundred and twenty ; too nian\ indeed for 
us, several of their canoes containing about sixteen or seven- 
teen men.

As they approached us, they seemed to be iti the great- 
est amazement, not kno\%ing what to make of us. They 
rowed round the ship, which occasioned us to call to the 
men in the boats not to suffer them to come near them.* — 
Hereupon the\ beckoned to the savages to keej) back, which 
they according!) did ; but at their retreat they let fly about 
hfly arrows among us, and very much wormded one of our 
men in the long-boat^ 1 called to them not to fire upon 
any account, but liaadiiig them down some deal boards, the 
carpenters made them a kind of fence to shield them from 
the arrows. In half an hour after they came so near astern 
of us, that we had a perfect siglil of them ; then they rowed 
a little thriller out, till they came directly along-side of us, 
and then ajiproached so near, that they couhi hear us speak ■, 
this made me order all my men too keep close, and get their 
guns ready. In the mean time 1 ordered Friday, to go out 
upon deck, and ask them in bis language what they meant. 
No sooner did he do so, but six of the savages, who were 
in the former canoes, stooping down showed us their 
naked backsides, as much as to say iu Euglisb, Kiss our 
: but Fri<lay quickly knew what this meant, b) im- 
mediately crying out they were going to shoot; unfortu- 
nately for him, poor creature, who fell under the cloud of 
three hundred arrows, no less than seven j)icMcing through 
his body, killing one of the best servants, and (aithfullest of 
companions in ail rny solitudes and affliction. 

So enraged was I at the death of poor Friday, that the 
guns, which before were charged only with powder, to 
frighten them, I ordered to be loaded with small shot ; nor 
did the gunners fail in their aim, but at this broadside split 
and oversrt thirteen or fourteen of their canoes, which 
killed 'numbers of them and set the rest a swimming : the 
others, frigliteued out of their wits, little regarding their 
fellows drowning, scoured away as fast as they could. One 
poor wretch our people took up, swimming for his life an 
hour after. He was very sullen at first, so that he would 
neither eat or speak ; but I took away to cure him, by 
ordering them to throw him into the sea, which they did, 
and then he came swimming hack like a cork, cailing in his 
tongue, as I suppose, to save him. So we took him on board, 
but was a long lime before wc could make him speak 
or understand English ; yet when we bad taught him, he 
told us, they were going with their kings to %ht a jj^eat

battle ; and when we asked iiim, what made them come up 
to us ? he said, ‘‘ to makee de great wonder look f here 
it is to be noted, that those natives, and those of Africa, 
always add two e's at the end of English words, as makee, 
takee, and the like, from which it is a very difficult thing to 
make them break off. 

Being now under sail, we took our last farewell of poor 
honest Friday, and intered him with* all possible decency 
and solemnity, putting him in a coffin, and committing 
him to the deep, at the same time causing eleven guns to 
be fired over him, Thus ended the life of one of the most 
grateful, faithful, honest, and affectionate servant, that ever 
any man was blessed with in the world. 

Having now a fair wind for Brazil, in about twelve days 
time we made land in the latitude of five degrees south of 
the; line. Four days we kept on S. by E. in sight of shore, 
when we made Ca[)e St. Augustine, and in three days we 
came up to an anchor off the Bay of All Saints. I had great 
difficulty here to get leave to hold correspondence on shore 
for neither the figure of my partner, my two merchant trus- 
tees, nor the fame of rny wonderful preservation in the 
island, could procure me the favour, till such time as the 
prior of the mouastery of the Augustines (to whom I had 
given 501) moidores,) obtained leave from the Governor, for 
me, personally, with the Captain and one more, together 
witli eiglit sailors, to come on shore ; upon this condition, 
that we should not land any goods out of the ship, nor 
carry any persou away without licence j 1 found means, 
however, to get on shore three bales of English goods, sucli 
as fine broad cloths, stuft's, and some linen, which I brought 
as a present for my partner, ho had sent me on board a 
present of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth 
about thirty moidores, including some tobacco, and three 
or four fine gold medals. 

Here 1 delivered niy partner in goods to the value of 
100/ sterling, and obliged him to fit up the sloop I bought 
for the use of ruy island, in order to send them refreshments ; 
and so active was he in this matter that he had tlie vessel 
finished in a few days, to the master of which 1 gave par- 
ticular instructions to find the place. 1 soon loaded him 
with a small cargo ; and one of our sailors offered to settle 
there, upon my letter to the Spanish governor, if I would 
allot him tools and plantation. This 1 willingly granted,

andiftve him the savage we had taken prisoner to be his 
slave. All. things being ready -for the voyage my old 
partner told me there was an acf|naintance of his» a Brazil 
planter, who having fallen under the displeasure of the 
church, and in fear of the Intjuisition, wliich obliged him to 
be coneeuled, would be glad of such an opportunity to 
make Ills es<‘ape, with his wife and two datighters ; and ifl 
would allot them a ptantatioii in fny island, he would give 
a small stoek to begin with, for that theotlieers had al- 
ready, seized his etfecis and estate, and left him nothing but 
a little household Sturt' and two slaves, 'rhis rerpiesl 1 pre- 
sentl\ granted, concealing him and his family on l)oard our 
shij), till such time as llie sloop (where all tin* effects were) 
was gom* out of llie bay, and then we put them on board, 
who carried some mateiials, and j)iant» for planting sugar- 
canes, along with them. By this sloop, among other things, 
1 sent my subjects three milch cows and five calves, about 
22 hogs, three sows fjig with pig, two marcs and a stone- 
horse. I also engaged three Portugal women to go for sake 
of the Spaniards, which, with the persecuted man’s tw'o 
daughters, were sutlicient, since the rest had wives of their 
own, though in another countr>' ; all wliich cargo arrived safe, 
no doubt, to their exceeding comfort, who, with this addi- 
tion, were about sixty or .seventy people, b<*sides children. 

At this j)lace my truly honest and )>ious clergyman left 
me } for a shij) being ready to set sail for I.isiion, he asked 
me leave to go thither) but 1 assure \ou it was with the 
greatest reluctance I })arlc<i from a person, wlu»se virtue 
and piety merited the greatest esteem. 

From the Brazil, we made ilirectly over the Atlantic 
Ocean to the Caj)e of (iood Hope, having a tolerable good 
vovage, steering for the most part S. K. We were on a 
trading \ovage, and bad a supercargo on board, who wai* 
to direct all the ships motions after she arrived at the Cape, 
onl\ being limited to a certain number of days, for stay, by 
charter party, at the several ports she was to go to. At the 
Caj>€ vve only took in fresh water, and then sailed for the 
coast of Cor<nnandel j we were there informed, that a French, 
man of war of ">0 guns, and two large rnercliant ships, were 
sailed for the Indies, but we^ieard no more of them. 

In our passage, we touched at the island of Madagascar, 
where, though the inhabitants are naturally fierce and trea<

clierous, and go constantly armed with bows and lances, 
yet for some time they -treated us ciully enough j and, in 
exchange for knives, scissors, and other trifles they brought 
us eleven good fat bullocks, which we took partly for pre- 
sent victuals, and the remainder to salt for the ship’s use. 

So curious w'as I to view every corner of the w orld where 
I came to, that 1 went on shore as often as I could. One 
evening when on shore, we obser\e<l !i umbers of the people 
stand gazing at us at a distance. We thonglit ourselves in 
no danger, as they had hitherto used us kindly, However 
we cut three honghs out of a tree, slicking them at a distance 
from us, which it seems in tliat country, is not only a token 
of truce and amity, but when poles or boughs are set upon 
the other side, it is a sign tlie truce is accepted. In 
these treaties, however, there is one principal thing to be 
regarded, that neither parly come beyond one another’s 
three poles or boughs ; so that the middle space is not only 
secure, but is also allowed a.s a market for trail ic and com- 
merce. When the truce is thtis accepted, thev stick up 
their javelins and lances at the tirst poles, and c(i^ie on un- 
armed j but if any violence is olVered, away jjiey run to 
their poles, take uj) their weapons, and then the truce is 
at an end. This evening it happened that a greater num- 
ber of people than usual, both men and women, traded 
among us for such toys as we had, with such great civility, 
that w e made us a little tent of large boughs of trees, some 
of the men resolving to lie on shore all night ; but for my 
part, I and some others took our lodgings in the boat, with 
boughs of trees spread over it, having a sail spread at the 
bottom to lie upon. About two o'clock in the morning we 
were awakened by the tiring of muskets, and our men cry- 
ing out lor iielp, or else they would all he murdered. Scarce 
had we time to get the boat ashore, wlien our men came 
plunging themstdves into the water, with about four hun- 
dred of the islanders at tJieir heels. We took up seven of 
the men, tlnee of them very much wounded, and one left 
behind kille<l, while the enemy poured their arrows so 
thick among us, that we were liirced to make a harricado, 
with hoards l\ing at the side of the boat, to shield ns from 
danger ; ;tnd, having got ready our fire-arms, we returned 
tlieiii a voUev, w hich w'ounded several of them, as wr could 
bear by their cries. In this condition we lay till break of 
day, and then making .signals of distress to the ship, which 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 313 

my nephew, the captain, heard^ind understood, he weighed 
anchor, and stood as near the shore as possible, and then 
sent another boat with ten hands in her to assist us ; but we 
called to them not to come near, iiirormiiig th^mofour un- 
happy condition. However they ventured ; when one of 
the men taking the end of a f(»\v-hne in one hand, and keep- 
ing our boat between him and our adversaries, swam to us, 
and slipping our cahlf'^, they towaxl us out ot reach of their 
arrows, and (|uickly altera broadside was gi\en them from 
the ship, width made a most dreadful iiavock among thcin. 
When we got on board we examined into the occasion of 
this tray. 'I'lie men who fled informed us that an old wo- 
man, who sold ndlk within the poles, had brought a young 
woman with her, who carried roots and herbs, the sight of 
whom so much tempted onr men. that they offered rude- 
ness to the maid, at which the old woman set up a great 
cry ; nor wriuldtlie sailors part with their prize, but carried 
her among the trees, vHnle the old woman went and 
brought a whole army down upon them. At tin* beginning 
of the attack, one of our men was killed with a lance, and 
the fcll(»\vwho began the mischief paid dear enough for 
his mistress, though as yet we did not know what had be- 
come of him ; the n st luckily escaped. The third night 
after the action, being curious to understand bow affairs 
stood, 1 took the supercargo and twenty stout fellows with 
me, and landed about two hours before midnight at the same 
place where those Indians stood the night before, and there 
we divided our men into two bodies, the boatswain com- 
manding one, and I another. It was so dark, that we 
could see nobody, neither did wc hear any voice near us ; 
but b> and by the boatswain falling over a dead body, wc 
agreed to halt till the moon should rise, which wc knew 
would be an hour after. We perceived here no fewer than 
two and thirty bodies upon the ground, whereof two were 
not quite dead. Satisfied with this discovery, 1 was for go- 
ing on board again but the boatswain and Uie rest told me, 
they would make a visit to the Indian town, where these 
’x>g's, so they called them, resided, asking me at the same 
ime to go along with him, for they did not doubt, besides 
gelling a good booty, but ihey should tine Tom Jlcflery 
there, for that was the unhappy man we missed. But 1 
iiUerly refused to go, and commanded them back, bein^ 



214 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

unwilling to hazard their lives, as the safety of the ship 
whohy depended upon them. Notwithstanding all I could 
say to them, they all left me but one, and the supercargo ; 
so we three returned to the boat, where a boy was left, re- 
solving to stay till they returned. At parting 1 told them 
1 supposed most of them would run the same fate w ith Tom 
Jeffery. To this they replied, ‘‘ Come boys, come along, 
well warrant we’ll come off safe enough ; and so away 
they went notwithstanding all my admonitions, either con- 
cerning their ow n safely or the preservation of tlie ship. — 
Indeed they were gallantly armed, every man having a 
musket, bayonet, and a pistol, besides cutlasses, hangers, 
pole-axes, and hand-granades. Tliey came to a few' In- 
tliaii bouses at first, which not being the town, they expected, 
they went farther, and tiiiding a cow tied to a tree, they 
concluded that she would be a suliicient guide and so it 
proved j for after they untied her, she led tliem directly 
to the town, which consi.>ted of above two hundred houses, 
several families living in some of the huts together. At 
their arrival, all being in a profound sleep, the sailors agreed 
to divide tiiernselves into three bodies, and set three parts 
of the town on fire at once, to kill those that were escaping, 
and plunder the rest of the houses. I’lius desperately re- 
solved, they went to work; but the first party had not 
gone far before they called to the rest that they band found 
Tom Jeffery; whereupon they all ran up to the place, and 
found the poor fellow indeed hanging up naked by one 
arm, and his throat almost cut from ear to ear. In a house 
that was hard by the tree, they found sixteen or seventeen 
Indians, who had been concerned in the fray ; two or three 
of them being wounded, were not gone to sleep ; this house 
they set on fire first, and in a few minutes after, five or six 
places more in the town appeared in flames. The confla- 
gration .spread like wild-fire, their houses being all of wood, 
and covered with flags or ruslies. The poor affrighted in- 
habitants endeavoured to run out tosa\e their lives, but 
they were driven back into the flames by the sailors, and 
killed without mercy. At tlie first house above mentioned, 
after the boatswain had slain tw'o with his pole-axe, he threw 
a hand-graiiade, into the house, wrhich bursting, made a ter- 
rible havock, killing and wounding most of them ; and their 
king and most of his train, who were in that house fell 
victims to their fury, every creature of them being either

smothered or burnt. All this while they never fired a {fun, 
lest the people should awaken faster tiieii tlu*v could oer- 
power them. But the fire awakened them last enough, 
which obliged our fellows to keep together in bodies. By 
this time the whole town was in a fiarne, yet their fury rt* 
ther increased, calling out to one another to rcmemb^rTom 
JeflFery. Tlie terrible light of this eonfiagratioii made me 
very uneasy, and roiufed my nepirew the ('aptain, and the 
rest of his men, who knew nothing of the matter. When 
he pcrcei\ed the dreadful smoke, and heard the guns go 
oft he readily concluded his men were in danger’i he there* 
fore takes another boat, and conieiJ ashore himself, with 
thirteen men well armed. He was greatly surprised to sett 
me and only two men in the boat, but more so when 1 told 
liim the story ; but though 1 urged with him, as 1 did 
with llie men, about the dangers of the vovage, the interests 
of the merchants and owners, and the safety of the ship, yet 
my iicplu'w, like the rest, declared, that lie would rather 
lose the ship, Ins voyage, his life and all, then his men should 
be lo>t for want of lielp ; and so away lie went. For my 
part, seeing him resoKed to go, I had not power to slay 
behind. He ordered tl>e pinnace back again for twelve 
men more, and then we marched directly as the ftame 
gn idl'd ns. But surely never was such a scene of horror 
behehl, or more dismal cries heard, except when Oliver 
Cromwell took Drogheda, in Ireland, where he neither 
spared man, woman, ufir child. 

The first object, I think, we met witli, was the ruins of 
one of their habitations, before wbieli lay lour men and three 
women killed, and two more burnt to death among the fire, 
which, was now' decaying. Nothing could appear more 
barbarous than this revenge j none more cruel Uian the 
authors of it. As we went on, the fire iucrea'^eil, and the 
cry proceeded in proportion. We had not gone much far- 
ther, when we beheld three naked women, followed by six'* 
teen or seventeen men, living with the greati*st swiftnesi 
from our men, w ho shot one of them in our sight. When 
they perceived us, whom thev supposed also their murderers, 
they set up a mostdreadful sliiiek, and both of them swoon-* 
ed away in fright. This wan a sight which might have 
softened the hardest heart ; and in pity we took some waya 
to let them know we would not hurt them, while the poor 
creatures, w ith bended knees and Ufted-up hands, made 



216 


LIFE AND ADVENTURES 


piteous lamentations to us to save their lives. 1 ordered 
our men not to hurt any of the poor creatures whatsoever ; 
but being willing to understand the occasion of all this, I 
went among these unhappy wretches, who neither under- 
stood me nor the good I meant them. However, being 
resolved to put an end to this barbarity, I ordered the men 
to follow me. We had not gone lifty yards before we came 
up with the boatswain, with four of our men at his heels all 
of them covered with blood and dust, and in search of more 
people to satiate their vengeance. As soon as we saw them 
we called out and made them understand who we were ; 
upon which they came up to us, setting up a halloo of tri- 
umph, ill token that more help was come. “ Noble Captain, ‘ 
said he to my nephew, “ I’m glad you’re come ; we have 
not half done with these villanous hellhound dogs ; we’ll 
root out the very nation of them from the earth, and kill 
more than poor Tom has hairs upon his head and thus he 
went on till 1 interrupted him — ‘‘ Blood thirsty <log,’’ said 
I, “ will your cruelty never end? 1 charge xou touch not one 
creature more ; stop your hands and stand still, or you’re 
a dead man this moment.'’ Why, Sir, ’ said he, “ you 
neither know' whom you are protecting, nor what they have 
done : but pray come bilher, and behold an instance of 
compassion, if such cau merit \our clemency and with 
that he showed me the poor ftdlow with his throat cut, 
hanging upon the tree. 

Indeed, he e was enough to till their breasts with rage, 
which, however, i thought had gone too far, agreeable to 
these words of Jacob to bis sons Simeon and Levi: “ Cursed 
be their anger, for it was fierce : and their wrath, for it 
was cruel." But tliis sight made my nephew and the 
rest as bad as they : nay, my nephew declared, his con- 
cern was only for bis men : as for the people, not a soul 
of them ought to live. Upon this, tlie boatswain and eight 
more directly turned about, and went to finish the intended 
tragedy ; which being out of my power to prevent, I re- 
turned back from the dismal sight; and tlie piteous cries of 
those unfortunate creatures, who were made victims to their 
fury. Indeed it was an engregious piece of folly in me to 
return to the boat with but ene attendant ; and I had very 
near paid for il, having narrowly escaped forty armed In- 
dians, who had been alarmed by the confiagration ; but 
having passed the place where they stood, I got to the boat,

accompanied with the supercargo, and so went on hoard, 
sending the pinnace back again, to assist the men in what 
might happen. When I had got to the boat, the tire was 
almost extinguished, and the noise abated ; but I had scarce 
been halt* an hour on board the ship, when 1 heard another 
volly gi^en by our sailors, and a great smoke, which, as I 
afterwards found, was our men falling upon those houses 
and persons that slooif Ix tweeii them anti the him ; but here 
they spared the ^^ives and chddren, and killed only the men, 
to the number of about sixteen or se\enteen. By the time 
they got to the shore, the pinnace and the ship’s lioat were 
ready to receive them, and they all g(»t safe on-board, not 
a man of tliein liaxing received the least hurl, except two, 
one of them having sirained Ids foot, and the other burnt his 
hand a little; for they met with no resistance, the pwr 
Indians being unprepared, amazed, and confounded. 

I was extn'mely angry with every tme of them, but par- 
ticularly with the captain, who, instead of cooling the rage 
of the men, had prompted them on to further inischi(?f ; nor 
could he make me any other excuse, but that as he was a 
man, he could not master his passi<ms at the sight of one of 
his men so cruelly murdered. As for the rest, knowing 
they were not under my command, they took no notice of 
my anger, but rather boasted of their revenge. According 
to" all tlieir acccounts, they killed or destroyed about I AO 
men, women, and ciiildren, besides burning the town to 
ashes. '^I'hev took their companion Tom Jefirry front the 
tree, coviTcd him with some <»f the ruins, and so left him. 
But however this action of our men might seem to them 
justitidlile, vet I alwa\s openly c<iiidemned it with the ap- 
pellatiori ot tlie Massacre of Madagascar. For though the 
natives had slain this Jetfery, yet certainly he was the first 
aggressor, by attempting to violate the chastity of a young 
innocent woman, who \eiiture(l clown to them, on the faitli of 
the public capitulation, which was so treacherously broken. 

While we were under sail, the boatswain would often 
t defend his bloodv action, by saving, that the Indians had 
broke the truce the night before, by shooting one of our 
men without just provocation : and what it the poot ffdlow 
had taken a little lil>erty with the wench, he ought not to 
have been murdered in s<» vilianous a manner; and that 
they had acted uolliing but what the divine laws cominif- 
sioned to be done to such homicides. However I was in 

K 



218 i-iFE and adventures 

the same mind as before, telling them that they were mur- 
derers, and bid them depend upon it that God would blast 
their voyage, for such an unparalleled piece of barbarity. 

When we came to the Gulph of Persia, five of our men 
who ventured on shore, were either killed or made slaves 
by the Arabians, the rest of them having scarce time to 
escape to their boat. This made me upbraid them afresh 
with the retribution of* Heaven for such actions ; upon 
which the boatswain very warmly asked me, “ Whether 
those men on whom the tower of Siloam fell, were greater 
sinners than the rest of the Galileans? and besides. Sir,” 
said he, none of these five poor men that are lost were 
wi'h us at the Massacre of Madagascar, as you call it, and 
therefore ,our representations are very unjust, and your ap- 
plication ini]>roper. Ro'^ides/' ailded he, “ you are con- 
tinually using the men very ill u()on this account, and, be- 
ing hut a passanger yonrscif, we are not obliged to bear it ; 
nor (“an we tell what evil designs you may have to bring us 
to judginent for it in England j and, therefore, if you do 
not leave this discourse, as also not concern yourself with 
any of our afi'airs, I will leave the ship, and not sail among 
siicl\ dangerous company.” 

All this I heard very patiently ; hut, it being often re- 
peated, I at length told liim, the concern 1 had on hoard 
was none of his business ; that 1 was a considerable owner 
in the ship, and therefore had a right to speak in common, 
Und that I was no way accovinlahle to him, nor any body 
else. As no more passed for some time after, 1 thought 
all had been over. At this time we were in the road of 
Bengal, where going, on shore with the supercargo one day, 
in the evening, as I was preparing to go on hoard, one of 
the men came to me, and told me, I need not trouble my- 
self to come to the boat, for that the cockswain and others 
bad ordered him not to carry me on hoard any more. This 
insoltMit message much surprised me, }et 1 gave him no 
answer to it, hut went directly and acquainted the super- 
cargo, entreating him to go on hoard, and, by acquainting 
the Captain with it, to prevent the mutiny which 1 perceived 
would liaj)pen. But before I had spoken this, the matter 
w as eftVeted on hoard ; for, no sooner w as he gone off in 
tlie lH>at, hut the boatswain, gunner, carj)enter, and ail the 
inferior officers, came to the quarter-deck, desiring to speak 
with the Captain ^ and there the boatswaiiv made a long

tit 

harangue, exclaiming against me, as before mentioned, that 
il 1 had not gone on shore peaceably for ray own diversion, 
they, by violence, would ha\e compelled me, for their sa* 
tisfaction : that as they had shipped with the Captain, so 
they would faithfully serve him; but if 1 did not quit the 
siiip, or the Captain oblige me to it, they would leave the 
ship immediately: hereupon, turning his face about, by 
wav of signal, tliev all cried out,. “ ONE and ALL ! ONE 
and ALL ! 

You nmy be sure, that though iny nephew was a man of 
great courage, yet he could not but be surprised at their 
sudden and unexpected bebatiour -, and though he talked 
stoutly to them, and afterwards expostulated with them, 
that in common justice to me, who was a considerable own- 
er in the ship, they could not turn me, as it were, out of ray 
ouu liouse, which might bring their lives in danger should 
l!ie\ e\er be taken in England ; nay, though he invited the 
boatswain on shore to accomodate matters with me, yet 
all this, I say signified nothing; they would have nothing to 
do witli me; and they were resolved to go on shore if 1 
came on board. Well,” said my nephew, if you arc 
so resolved, permit me to talk with him, and then I have 
done ami so he came to me, giving me an account of their 
resolution, how one and all designed to forsake the ship 
when 1 came on board, for which he was mightily concern- 
ed. “ I am glad to see you iiej)hcw,” said I, “and rejoice 
it is no worse, since they have not rebelled against you ; 

1 onl> desire you to send my necessary things on shore, 
with a sufhcienl sum of money, and 1 will find my way to 
England as well as 1 can.” Though this grieved my ne- 
phew to the heart, yel there was no remedy ]>ut compliance : 
in short, all my necessaries were sent to me, and so this 
matter was over in a few hours. 

1 think 1 was now near a thousand leagues farther off 
England by sea, than at my little kingdom, except this dif- 
ference, that I might travel by land over the (ireat Mogul’s 
country to Surat, from thence to Bassora, by sea up the 
Persian Gulpli, then take the way of the caravans over the 
Arabian Desert to Aleppo and Scanderoon, there lake 
irfiij)ping to Italy, and so travel by land into France, and from 
thence across the sea to England. 

Mv nephew left me two persons to attend me; one of 
them was his servant, and tlie other clerk to the purser,

who" engaged to be mine. , I took lodgings in an English 
woman’s house, Svhere several French, one English, and two 
Italian merchants resided. The handsome entertainment 
I met with here, occasioned me to stay nine months, con- 
sidering what course 1 should take. Some English goods 
1 had with me of great value, besides a thousand pieces of 
eight, and a letter for more, if there was such necessity. — 
The goods 1 soon disposed of to advantage, and bought here 
be\eraj good diamonds, which I could easily carry aiiout 
with me. One morning the English merchant came lo me, 
as being very intimate together, “ Countryman,” said he, 
“ I have a project to communicate to you, which I hope 
will suit to both our advantage. To be short. Sir, we arc 
both in a remote part of the world from our country j hut 
yet in a place where men of business may get a great deal 
of money. Now, if you will put a thousand pounds to my 
thousand pounds, we will hire a ship to our satisfaction ; 
you shall be Captain, 1 will he merchant j and we’ll go a 
trading voyage to China, for why should we lie still like 
drones, while the whole world is in continual motion.” 

This proposal soon got my consent, being very agreeable 
lo my ramhliiig genius j and the more so, because I looked 
upon my countryman to he a very sincere person ; it re- 
(juired some lime before we could get a vessel to our mind, 
and .sailors to man it accordingly j at length we bought a 
shij), and got an English mate, boatswain, and gunner, a 
l^tch carjicnter, and three Portuguese foremast-men 5 and 
for want of others made shift with Indian seamen. \Vc first 
sailed to Achin, in the island of Sumatra, and thence lo Siam, 
where we bartered our wares, for some arrack and opium, 
the last of which bore a great price among the Chinese; in 
a word, we went up to Suskan, making a very great voyage 
and, after eight months time, 1 returned to Bengal, very wel. 
satisfied with this adventure, having not only got a suliicient 
quantity of money, hut an insight of getting a great deal more. 

The next voyage my friend proposed to me, was to go 
among the Spice islands, and bring home a load of cloves 
from the Manillas, or thereabouts ; islands belonging partly 
to Spain, hut where the Dutch trade very considerably. 
We were not long in prepariiit for this voyage, which we 
made no less successful than the last, touching at Borneo, 
and several other places which I do not perfectly remem- 
ber, and returned home in about five months time. We

soon sold our sj>ices, which were cnieflv cloves and some 
nutmeg'^, to the Persian ruerehaiits, who carried them away 
for the Gulph ; and, in short, making tive to one advantage, 
wo wore leaded with money. 

Not long after my friend and I had made up our accounts, 
to our entire satisfaction, there came in a Dutch coaster 
frf)m BaUavia of ahopt two hundred tons. The crew of 
the vessel pretended themselves so sickly, that (here were 
not hands suffieient to undertake a vyyage ; and the Captain 
having given out that he intended to go to Europe, public 
notice wa'^ given that tli*' ship was to he sold. No sooner 
did this <‘ome to our ears, hut we bi>ught tlie shi[), paid tlic 
n}aNt<T, and took possession, We would also have very 
willingly cfitcrtaiued some of the men ; hut they having 
received their share of booty, were not to be found, being 
altog( (her tied to Agra, the great city of the Mogul’s resi- 
<lenee : and from thence went to travel to Surat, and so liy 
the sea to the I’ersian Gulpli. And indeed they had reason 
to tl\ in this manner, ; for the truth of it was, the pretendcfl 
Captain was the gunner only, and not the commander j 
tfjal having been on a trading voyage, they were attackeil 
on the shore by the Malavans, who killed three men and 
tlie Captain j after whose death the other <deven men run 
away with the ship to the Bay of Bengal, and left the mate 
and live men more on shore ; but of this aHTair w'e sliall 
have occasion to sj)eak more at length hereafter. 

However lie came by the ship, we thought we hou||^t 
it honestly : neither did we suspect any thing of the matter, 
when the man showed us a hill of sale for the ship (undoubt- 
edly forged,) to one Emanuel Clostershoven, which name he 
went'hy. And so, without any more to do, we picked up 
some butch and English seamen, resolving for another voy- 
age for cloves among the Philippine and Molucca islands : 
in short, we continued thus fi\e or six years, trading irom 
port to port with extraordinary success. In he seventh 
year, we undertook a voyage to China, designing to touch 
at Siam, and buy some rice by the way. In this voyage 
contrary win<l'> beat us up and down for a considerable time 
among the islands in the Straits of Molucca. No sooner 
were we clear of those ntgged seas, but we perceived 
our ship had sprung a leak, which obliged us to put into the 
river CambcKlia, which lies northward of the Gulpb, and 
goes up to Siam. 



UFE AND ADVENTURES 


One day, as 1 was on sliore refreshing myself, there 
came to me an Englishman, who was a gunner’s mate on 
board an English East-India ship, riding up the river near 
the city of Cambodia : Sir’’ said he, “ you may wonder 

at my business, having never seen me in your life ; but tho’ 
1 am a stranger I have something to tell you that very near- 
ly concerns you ^ and indeed it is the imminent danger you 
are in has moved me to’ give you this t*imely notice.” — 
Danger!’* said I, “ what danger^ 1 know of none, ex- 
cel)! my ship being leaky, for which 1 design to have her 
niu aground to-morrow morning *’ “ I hope you will be 

hctter employed when you shall hear what I have to say to 
you. You know the town of Cambodia is about fifteen 
leagues up this river ; about three leagues on this side of it, 
tJierc lie two Dutch and three English ships. And would 
vou venture here without considering what strength you 
iiave to engage them?” 1 knew not what he meant by this 
discourse, and turning short uj)on liim, Sir,” saidl, “ 1 
know' no reason 1 have to he alraid either of any Dutch or 
English ships. I am no int<*rloper, and what business have 
tlicy with me?” Well, Sir,” said the man, “ if you do 
tliink yourself secure, all as 1 can say you must take your 
chance ; however, I am very sorry you are so deaf to good 
advice ; but 1 assure you, if you do not put to sea immedi- 
ately, you will be attackad by five long boats full of men, 
hanged y ourself for a pirate, if you are taken, and the par- 
ti^lars examined afterwards. I thought, Sir,” added he, 
I might have met a better reception for such a singu- 
lar piece of service.” “ Sir,** said I, “ I never was un- 
grateful to any man ; but pray explain yourself, and I’ll go 
on board this minute, whether the leak be stopped or no.” 
“ Why, Sir,” said he “ to he short because time is precious, 
the matter is this; \ on know well enough that you was 
with the ship at Sumatra, when your Captain was murdered 
by the Malayans, with three of his sailors; and that either 
you, or some who w'cre on board with you, ran away with the 
ship, and are since turned pirates at sea. Now, Sir, this 
is the sum of what 1 have to say 3 and I can positively assure 
you, that if you are taken, you will be executed without 
much ceremony, for iimloubte^ly yon cannot nut be sen- 
sible what little law^ merchant ships show to pirates, when- 
ever they fall into their hands.*’ 

** Sir,** said I 1 thank you for your kind information 3

and thoujjh I am sure no manr could come more liotu stly 
by the ship than I Imve done, yet knowing their enter]>rize, 
and being satisfied of your lumest intention, i’ll be upon niy 
defence.” ** Pr’ythee, Sir,'" said the mail “ tlou'i talk of 
being upon your defence, the best that >ou can make is to 
be out of danger; and therefore, if yon have any regard for 
your life, and the li\es of \our men, take (he ail\antage, 
without fail, of puttm^g out to seii«at high-water , by uliu h 
means, as yon have a wlude tidt* before n<ui, >on will !>e gone 
too far out of tlieir reaeh before they can come down.” 

“ I am nli^htil^ well satisfi<‘d," saul I, “ in this particular j 
and for your kindni'ss, whieh nuTits my great esteem, prav, 
Str, what amends shall I make \ou He n plied “ 1 know

leave the wlioie to yuir generosity.’' 

So rea.sonable did this everyway apjiear, tliat I imuudi- 
atelv consented, and we wtait <lir<*ctly on board. As soon 
as we came on board, mv partner calls joyfullv out, “ 'I1iat

to be got up : and tliougii the tide was not quite down, 
yet being assisted with a In tie land bree/e, we stood tt> sea. 

I then called my jrartner into the cabin, and relati d the

the two nuai I bad brought on board. Scarce bad we 
finished our discourse upmi this head, but a sailor cairn* to 
the cabin door, with a mei^age from the Captain, that we 
were chased bv five sloo]»s full of armed men. ^ cry 
well,” said I, “it is plain now there is soincUilng in it.’’ — 
And so, going upon deck, I told all the men there was a 



224 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

design for seizing the ship, and of executing us fof pirates; 
apd asked them whether they would fiiitlifuUy stand by us, 
and by one another? To which they unanimously replied, 
“ That they would tight to their last drop of blood.” I 
then asked the Cajitain, which way he thought best for us 
to manage the battle? “Sir,” said he, “ the only method 
is to keep them off with our great shot as long as w^e are 
able, and then have recourse to our small arms j and when 
both lliese fail us, then retire to close quarters, when per- 
haps the enemy, wanting materials, can neither break open 
our bulk-heads, nor get in upon us.” Mean-time the gun- 
ner was ordered to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out 
of the steerage, and so load them with musket-bullets and 
small pieces of old iron j and the deck being cleared, we 
pre))aied for the engagement, still, however, keeping out 
at sea. The boats followed us with all the sail they could 
make, and we could perceive the two foremost were Eng- 
lish, wJiich outsailed the rest by two leagues, and which we 
found would come up with us: herenj>on we fired a gun 
without ball, intimating that they should bring to, and we 
put out a flag of truce, as a signal for jiarley ; and finding 
them crowding after us, till they came within shot, we took 
in our white, and hanging out the red flag, immediately 
^ired at them with ball: we then called to them with a 
speaking trumpet, bidding them at their peril keep off. 

Hut all this signified nothing ; for depending upon the 
strength that followed them, they were resolutely bent for 
mischief: hereupon 1 ordered them to bring the ship to, by 
which means, they lying upon our broadside, we let fly at 
them at onee, one of whom carried away the stern of the 
hindeiinost tn)al, and obliged them not only to take down 
tln ir saih but made them all run to the head of the boat, to 
keep them from sinking, and so she lay by, having enough 
of it. In the mean time, we prepared to welcome the fore- 
most boat in the same manner. M Idle we were doing this, 
one of the three Idndermost boats came up to the relief of 
that which was disabled, and took the men out of her. We 
again called to parley with them • hut, instead of an answer, 
one of the boats came close under our stern j whereupon 
our gunner let fly his two chase guns, but missing, the men 
in tile boat shouted, and waving their caps, came on with 
greater fury. To lepair this seeming disgrace, the gunner 
soon got ready, and firing a second time, did a great deal of

mischief among the enemy. We waved again, and bring- 
ing our quarter to bear npon tliem, tired three guns mere, 
when we found the boat a sinking, and several men already 
iu the sea ; hereupon, manning our pinnace, I gave orders 
to save as mauy as they could, and instantly to come on 
board, because the rest of their boats were approaching: 
accordingly they did 5a>, and took ,^ip three of them, one of 
whom was almost past rev ox cry ; and then crowding all the 
sail we could, after onr men came on board, ue stood out 
farther to sea, so that the other thri e boats gave o\er the 
chase, when they came iip to the fir>t two. Thus (h*Iivere<i 
from imminent <langer, we changed (oir course, to the east- 
ward, quite out ol tlu* course ot all Kunqx'an ships. 

H(‘i!ig now at sea, and inquiring more particularly of the 
two seamen, (he meaning of all thi«, the i)ntchman at once 
h t iis into th(‘ secret. Jb* (old us that the fellow who s(dd 
us» the ship was an arrant thief, who had run awa> with hi*r : 
that the captaifi was treac herously murd(‘r<‘d on (he coa*jt 
of Molucca by the natives there, with three of his nn n : 
that he, the Dutchman, and four more, bring obliged to 
have rcc<»nrse to the u'o<uls f<»r their sab ly, at hngth eseaped 
b\ means of a Dutch slop, in its way to f’diina, which liad 
srnt llicir boat on shore for fresh water ; that alter this, 
he went to lkita\ia; there two of the seamen belonging to 
the shiji (who had d<*serted the tesl in their trawds arriveil, 
and tiiere ga\e an account that tin* fellow who ran :iway 
with the ship had sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, w ho 
went a cruising, and fiad already taken onr English and two 
Dutch shi|»s richly laden. 

N<)W’, though this was absolutely false, rny partner truly 
said, that our fleliveraiK e was to be estia nierl .so much the 
more, by reason had we fidlen into their hands, we could 
have expected nothing from them but immediate deaths 
considering our accusers would have been our jmlges ; and, 
therefore, his opinion was to ntiirn directly to Bengal, 
where, being known, we could prove how honestly we came 
b\ the ship, of whom we bought her, and the like, and 
where we were sure of .some justice j at least would not be 
hanged first and judged afterwards. 1 was at first of my 
partner’s opinion, but when I had more seriously consider- 
ed of the matter, I told him we ran a great hazard in at- 
tempting to return, being on the wrong side of the Straits 



life and adventures 

of Molucca, and tiiat, if, upon alarm given, we should be 
taken by the Dutch at Batavia, or English elsewhere, our 
running away would be a sufficient evidence to condemn us. 
This danger indeed startled not only my partner, but like- 
wise all the ship’s company j so we changed our former re- 
solution, and resolved to go to the coast of Tonquin, and 
so to that of China, wh^re pursuing, our first design as to 
trade, we might likewise have an opportunity to dispose of 
the ship some way or other, and to return to Bengal, in any 
country vessel we could procure. This being agreed to, 
we steered away N. N. E. about 50 leagues oft the usual 
course 1o the east, which put us to some inconveniences. 
As the wind blew steadily against us, our voyage became 
more tedious, and w c began to be afraid of waul of provi- 
sions 5 and what was still worse, we apprehended that as 
those ships, from whose boats we bad escaped, were bound 
to China, they might get before us, and have given fresh 
information, which miglit create another vigorous pursuit. 
Indeed 1 could not help being grieved, when 1 considered 
that I, who had nev^r wronged or defrauded any person in 
my life, w as now pursued like a common thief, and, if taken, 
to run the greatest danger of being executed as such j and, 
though innocent, 1 found myself under the necessity of dy- 
ing for my safety, and thereby escape being brought to 
shame, of w hich I was even more afraid than of death itself. 
It was easy to read my dcjectioii in ray countenance. iM\ 
mind was op[)rcsscd, like those unhappy, innocent persons, 
who being overpowered by blasphemous and perjured e\i- 
denees, wickedly resolved to take away their lives, or ruin 
their repuUitiou, have no other recourse in this world to 
ease their sorrow, but sighs, prayers, and tears. My partner 
seeing me so concerned, encouraged me as well as he «:ould j 
and after describing to me the several ports of that coast, 
he told me, he would either put me in on the coast of 
Cochiu-China , or else in the Bay of Tonquin, from whence 
\vc might g<vto Macao, a town once possessed by the Portu- 
guese, and where still many European families resided. 

To this place we steered, and early next morning came 
ill sight of the coast j but thought it advisable to put into 
a small river where we could, either overland, or by the 
ship’s pinnace, know what vessels were in any ports there 
abouts. This happy step proved our deliverance : for, next 
worniag, there came to the Bay of Tonquin two Dutch

as prisoners. The first they seized was a stout English 
saHor, who never fired his musket, like a fool as 1 imagined, 
but laid it down in the boat; butSie kew what he was 
doing ; for, ])y main force, lie dragged the Pagan out of the 
boat into ours by the two ears, and knocked his brains out 
against the boat’s gunnel ; a Dutchman (hat was next him 
snatched up the nuisket, and knocked down five more with 
the butt-end of it ; how eter, this was* doing very little to 
their number j but a strange unexpected accident, which 
rather merits laughter than any thing else, gave our men a 
complete victory over tjiem. 

It seems (lie carpenter, who was preparing to grave the 
outside of the ship, w ell as to pay the seams, where he 
caulked to stop the leaks, had gotten two kettles just let 
down ill the boat, one filled with boiling pitch, and the 
other with rosin, tallow, oil, and such stuff as the ship- 
wrights use; tlie carpenter’s man had a ^real iron ladle 
with which he used to supply the workmen, with hot stuff, 
and as two of tlie enemies entered the boat where the fel- 
low stood, he saluted them with a full ladle of the hot boil- 
ing liquor, which, the poor creatures being half naked, made 
them roar out, and jump into ihe sea. “ Well done, Jack,"’ 
says the carpenter, “ give them the other dose : and so 
stepping forward himself, takes a muj), and dipping it into 
the pitch-pot, lie and hii> mail so plentifully flung it among 
them, as tliat none escaped being scalded; upon wiiich they 
all made the best of their way, crying and howling in such a 
frightful matnier, that, in all luy adventures, I never heard 
the like. And, indeed, never was 1 better pleased with 
any conquest than I was with this, there being so little 
blood slied and having an aversion to killing such savage 
wretches, (more than was necessary,) as know ing they came 
on errands, which their laws and customs made them think 
were just and equitable. By this time all things being in 
order, and the ship swimming, they found their mistake so, 
they did not adventure a second attack. Thus ended our 
merry fight, and having got rice, bread, roots, and sixtegit 
good hogs on board the day before, we set sail, no t 
to go into the bay of Tonquin, but steered N. £. 
the island of Formosa, or as ^^ugh we would go ^

vision and fresh water, but dealt very fairly and honestly 
with us in their bar^^ans and a;;reemciits. From this place 
we steered nortlj, kcej)in" still off* the coast of China, till 
^ we were beyond all its ports where European ships usually 
come; and, at length being come to the latitude of thirty 
degrees, we resolvetl to put in the first trading port we 
should come at ; and standing for the sliore a boat came oft* 
two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot *oii board, 
who otfered his service ; we very gladly accepted him, and 
sent the boat back again. And now, having an old man 
on board, 1 talked to him of going to Nancpiin, the most 
north ward part of the coast of China. “ What will you do 
there?” said he, smiling. I toh! him we would sell our 
cargo and purchase calicoes, raw and wrought silks, tea, 
Ac. and so return the same way back. “ (),” said he, ** you 
had belter jiut in at Macao, where you may Iniy China wareH 
as cheap as at Naiiqiiin, and sell vour opium at a greater 
advance.” ‘‘ But,” said I, ** we are gentlemen, as well as 
merchants, and design to see the great city of Verkin, and 
the magnilicient court of the monarch of China.” “ Why, 
then,’’ said he, “ you should go to Ningpo, where there is 
a iiaNigable river tliat goes through the heart of that vast 
empire, two liuudrc'd and seventy leagues from the sea, 
which crosses all the rivers, passes consi<kTabIc hills, hy the 
help of the sluices and gates, and goes even up to the city of 
i’erkiii. Y<»u may go to Naiiquin if you please, and travel to 
IVrkiii, and there is a Dutch ship just before bound that way^’ 
At the name of a Dutch or Ibiglish ship, 1 was struck with 
confusion; they being as great a terror to me in this vessel, 
as an Algerine man of war is to fliem of the Mediterranean. 
File »ld man tiiiding me troubled, Sir,” said he, ♦* i ho|»c 
the Diitcli are not now at war with your nation.” “ No,” 
,'>aid I but (fod knows what liberty they may take when 
out of the reatdi of the law,” Wiiy,” says he, “ what occa- 
sion is there for peaceable merchants to fear ? For, believe 
me, they never meddle with any but P1II.\TES.” 

At the men lion iiig the word Pirates, my countenknee 
turned to that of scarlet ; uorwa.s it possible for me to con- 
ceal it from the old pilot ; who taking notice of it, *' Sir, ' 
said he, ** take 'what courM you please, Fll do you all the 
service I can.” “ Seignior,” aaid I, 1 am little con- 
cerned at your itientioning piimtea ; 1 hope there are none 
such in these seas, because you see in what weak condition

we are to defend ourselves.’* ** O, Sir,” said he, if that’s 
all, don’t be concerned j 1 don't remember one in these seas 
these tifteen years, except about a month ago one v^as seen in 
tlie bay of Siam, but he is gone to the southward ^ neither 
was she built for a privateer, but was run away with by a 
reprobate Captain, and some of his men, the right Captain 
having been murdered by. the Malayaus.” 

What!” said 1, (as though ignorant of what had hap- 
pened) “ did they kill the Captain !” “ No,'* said he, “ it is 
generally thought the IVlalayaiis murdered him; but perhaps 
they might procure them to do it, and therefore they justly, 
deserve hanging. The rogues were lately discovered in 
the Bay of Siam, in tlie river of Cambodia, by some Dhtch- 
men who belonged to the ship, and had mucii ado to escape 
the five boats that pursued them, but they have solemnly 
sworn to give no quarters to the Captain or the seamen, but 
hang them every one u|ton the yard-arm, without any for- 
mal business of bringing them to the court of judicature.” 

Being sensible that, having the old man on board, he 
was incapable of doing me any mischief, “ Well Seignior,” 
said 1, “it is for this very reasno 1 would have you carry 
us up to Nanquiii, where neither English nor Dutch ships 
come ; and 1 must tell you, their Captains are a parcel of 
rash, proud, insolent rascals, that neither know what belongs 
tti justice, nor how to behave ihemselves as the laws of God 
or nature directs ; fellows that would prove murderers to 
punish robbers, and take upon them to judge innocent men 
to death, without any proof to prove them guilty ; but [>er- 
haps I may live to call them to account for it, in a place 
where they may be taught how justice is to be executed.” 
And so 1 told him all the story of buying the ship, and how 
we were saved by the means of two men : that the murder 
of the Captain by the Malayans, as also the running away 
with the ship, I believed to be true ; but that we, who bought 
it, were turned pirates, was a mere fiction, to cover their 
cowardice and foolish bahaviour, when they attacked us ; 
and the blood of those men we killeil in our own just defence 
lay at their door, who w ere sent to attack us by surprise.” 

** Sir,” said the old man amazed^ “ you have taken the 
right course to steer to the north, and if 1 might advise 
yon, I would have you sell your ship in China, and buyer 
build another in that countiy ; and I’ll procure people to 
hiiy the one and sell the other.” ** Well, but Seignior,”

said I, if I sell the ship in this manner, 1 nmv hrinj^ some 
innocent persons into the same dangers 1 ha\c ^one through, 
perhaps worse than even death itselt : whereby I should be as 
guilty of their murder as their villanotis executioners/— 
“ That need not trouble yon,*' says the old iniin, “ I’ll hiid 
a way to prevent that ; for these commanders yon talk of, 
I know very well, and "id iidbnv them rij;litly of the mat- 
ter as you ha\e related, and am persuaded they will not 
only believe me, but act more cautiously for the future.” — 
“ And will you deliw*r one message from me to them?* 
** Yes, said he, “ if you will give it under your hand, that 
I may prove it not of my own prorluction." Hereupon 
1 wrote a large aceoiint of their Httiic king me in their long- 
boat, the pretended reason and unjust design of it ; that 
they liad done w lint tliey might be mhanied of, and could 
not answer for it at any fribioial in Knglaiul. But this letter 
was writ in \ain. Providence ordered things unother way. 
We sailed directlv tor Nan<[iiiu and in about thirteen days 
sail came to an anchor at lJ»e south-west point of the great 
gulf of that |)lace, whore we learned that two DuU'h 
ships were gon<‘ the length befor<* iis, and that we should 
certainly fall int(» their haruls. We were all at a great loss 
in this exigenev, and would verv gladly liave been on sliore 
almost any where; lint onr old pilot told me that if I 
would sail to the sontlivvaHl ahont two ami forty leagues, 
tliere was a little p<M't ealh'd Qniiichang where nc» Piiro- 
]>eaii ships ever came, and where we might consider what 
was further to he done. Aceonhnglv we weighed anclior 
the next day, calling only twice on sliore by the way to 
i:t‘t fresh water. I'he country p<f»ple very courteously 
sold us roots, tea, rice, fowls, and other provlsuins. After 
five (lavs sail we came to the port, ami lamled with unspeak- 
able joy. We resolved to dispose of ourselves and eflfecta 
in anv way possifde, rather than enter on boanl that ill-fated 
vessel more : for no slate can be more miserable limn a 
continued fear, which is a life of death, a confonoder oi 
our understanding, that sets the imagination at work io

And we scarce slejit <me without <lreaming of halters, 

yard-arm, or gibbets, or fighting, being taken, and being 
killed ; nay so violent were our apprehensions, that we 
would bruise onr heads and lieeU against the sides of Ihtc

cruelty at Ainbo^na, often came into our thouglits when 
awake ; and, for my part, I thought my condition very 
hard, that after so many ditHculties and such signal deliver- 
ances, I should be hanged in my old age, though innocent 
of any crime that deserved such punishment; but then re* 
ligion would seem to represent to me, as though the voice 
of it had said, consider, Q man ! what sins you have been 
formerly guilty of; which now thou art called to an account 
for . to expiate with thy blood ! And as to thy innocence, 
what art tiiou more innocent than thy blessed Redeemer 
Jesus Christ, who suffered for thy offences, and to whose 
providence you ought to submit, let what will happen ? 
After this, natural courage would inspireme to resist to the 
last drop of blood, and sooner die than suffer myself to be 
taken by boorish rascally Dutchmen, who had heart to tor- 
ment beyond. death itselfl 

But now, thank kind Heaven, being ashore, our old pilot 
procured us a lodging and warehouse for ouv g<Jod.s; it 
was a little hut, with a large warehouse joining to it, all 
built w ith canes, and palisadoed round witii large ones, to 
keep out pilfering thieves, which are very numerous in that 
countiw. The magistrates allowed us a little guard during 
tile night, and we employed a centinel \vi!h a kind of hal- 
bert, for threepence a day. The fair, or mart A\e found 
had been over for some time ; however, there remained in 
the river four junks and two Japan sliips, the merehants of 
the latter being on shore. In the first place, our old pilot 
brought us acquainted with the missionary Roman priests, 
who were converting the people to Christianity : two of 
them were reserved, rigid; and austere, applying themselves 
to the work they came about with great earnestness ' but 
the third, who was a Frenchman, called Father Simeon, was 
of a freer conversation, not seeming so serious and grave, 
yet no worse Christian than the other two, one of whom 
was a Portuguese, and the other a Genoese. Father Sinieou, 
it seems, was appointed to go to Pekin, the royal seat of 
the Emperor of the Chinese ; and he only waited for ano- 
ther priest, who was ordered from Macao to accompany 
him. We never met together, J)ut he was prompting me to 
accompany turn in that journey: Sir/’ said he, 1 

will show you the glorious things of this mighty empire, 
and a city, the city of Pekin, far exceeding London and- 
Paris, put them both together.’' One day in particular, be-

in" at dinner with lum, I showed some inclination to go j 
which maile him press the more upon me and my partner, 
to gain our perfect consent. “ But, Father Simeon/* said 
ni) inirtner, what satisfaction can \on have in our com- 
pany, whom you esteem as heretic s, and consequently object! 
not worthy yonr regard V' “ (>/* said he, you may be as 
good Catholics in time as those I hope to convert to our 
n ligioii.” “ And so*,” said I, “ shall have you preach- 
ing to us all the way, instead of pleasing ns with a descrip- 
tion of the country.” “ Sir,*' said he, “ however our reli- 
girin may be vilified by some people, it is very certain it 
neither divests us of good manners or Christian charity ; and 
as we are gentlemen, as such we may converse together 
without making one another uneasy.” 

But w e shall leave him aw hile, to consider of our ship and 
the merchanciise which we had to dispose of. Tliere was 
but very little trade in the place where we were ; and I 
was once resolved to venture to sail to the river Kilam, and 
so to the city of Nan<iuiii ; but Providence ordervnl it other- 
wise, by our old pilot’s bringing a Japan merchant to us, to 
see what goods we had. He immediately bought our opium, 
^)r which he gave us a very good price in gold by weight, 
some wedges of which were about ten or eleven ounces. 
It came into my head that perhaps he might buy the stiip 
too ) and I ordered his interpreter to propose it to him. — 
He said nothing then, but shrugged up his shoulders ; yet 
in a few days after he came, accompanied by a missionary 
priest, w ho was his interpreter, with this proposal. ** Thai 
as iic had bought a great quantity of our goods, he had not 
money enough to purchase our ship; but if I pleased he 
would liire her, with all my men, to go to Japan, and from 
tliencc with another loading to the IMiilippine islands, the 
freight of whicli he would very wllingly pay to us before ; 
hand and at their return to Japan, would buy the ship.'’ Upon 
this we asked the Captain and his men, if they were willing 
to go to Japan ; to which they unanimously agreed. While 
this was in agitation, Uie young mao, my nephew left to 
attend me, told me, ** Thai as 1 did not care to accept this 
prospect of advantage, he would manage it for me as 1 
pleated, and render me a ftdhful account of his success,

young mao s good, 1 discoursed with my partner about it, 
who, of his own generosity gave him his share of the vessel, 
80 that 1 could do no otherwise than give him mine : but, 
however, we let him have but the proper half of it, and 
preserved a power, that when we met in England if he 
had obtained success, he should account to us for one-half of 
the profits of the ship's freight, and the other should be his 
own. Thus having taken a writing under his baud, away 
he sailed to Japan, where the merchant dealt very honestly 
by him, got him a license to come on shore, sent him loaded 
to the Philippines with a Japanese supercargo, from whence 
he came back again loaded w ith European goods, cloves, and 
other spices. By this vo 3 age he cleared a considerable 
sum of money, which determined him not to sell his ship, 
but to trade on his own account; so he returned to the Ma- 
nillas, where, getting acquaintance, he made his ship free, 
was hired by the governor privately to go to Acapulco in 
America, on the Mexican coast, with a license to travel to 
the great city of Mexico. This traffic turned out greatly to 
account, and my friend finding means to get to Jamaica, re- 
turned nine years after exceedingly rich into England. 

In parting with the ship, it comes in course to consider 
of those men who had saved our lives when in the river of 
Cambodia; and though, by the way, they were a couple of 
rogues, who thought to turn pirates themselves, yet we 
paid them what they had before demanded, and gave each 
of them ^ small sum of money, making the Englishman a 
gunner, and tlie Dutchman a boatswain, with which they 
were very well contented. 

We were now about 1000 leagues farther from home 
tlian when at Bengal. AM the comfort we could expect 
was, that there being another fair to be kept in a month's 
lime, we might not only purchase all sorts of that country's 
manufactures, birt very possible find some Chinese junks, 
or vessels from Tonquili, to be sold, which would carry us 
and our goods wheresoever we pleased. Upon these hopes, 
we resolved to coiitll|Us6^_and \o divert ourselves, we^O^

We were tive and ^\vcnt^ days tra\elling through tliis rnUcr* 
able country, infinitely populous, but ns iiiditVewmtly cul- 
tivated ; and yet their pride is infinitely greater than their 
poverty, insomtieh (hat the priests themselvca deride them. 
As we passed by the house of one of llieir country gentle- 
men, two leagues of Naiupiin, we had the honour, forsooth, 
toride\\illi the Chinese squire, about two miles Never 
was Don (Quixote so exactly imitated ! Never such n com- 
pound of pomp and poverty seen before ! 

His habit, made of calico, was dirty, greasy and very 
proper for a Merry Andrew' or Scaramouch, with all ita 
tawdry tappings, as hanging sleeves, tassels, Ac. though 
torn and rent in almost every part ; his vest nnderncaCii it 
was no levs dirty, but more greasy, resembling the most ci- 
quisite sloven, or greasy butcher: bis horse, (worse than Ro- 
sinaiite, or the famous steed of doughty liudibras) was a 
poor starved, decrepit thing, that would not sell for thirty 
shillings in England ; and yet this piece of worshipful pomp 
w'as attended with ten or twelve slaves, who giiar<h?d their 
master to his country seat We stoppeef at a little village 
for refreshment ; and when we came by the country seat of 
this great man, we found him sitting under a tree before his 
door, eating a mess of boiled rice, with a great pu*ce of 
garlic in the middle, and a bag tille<l with green pepper by 
him, and another plant like ginger, together with a piece 
of lean mutton in it: this was his worship's repast^ but 
pray obsarve the state of the food ! two women slaves brought 
him his food, which being laid before him, twoothera ap- 
peared to perft>nii their respective otiices ; one fell him 
with a spoon, while the other scraped off what fell upon his 
beard and taffety vest, and gave it to a particular favourite 
to eat. And thus we left the wretch pleased with the con- 
ceit of our admiring his ma'gnificience, which rather merited 
our scorn and detestation. 

At length we arrived at the great city of Pekin, tCCO»- 
pimied by two servants, and the old Portuguese pilot* whiMte

charges we bore, and who served us as an interpreter by 
the way. We had scarce been a week at Pekin, but we 
comes laughing to us, Ah! Senior Inglise,” said he, 

** me some thing tell you make you heart glad, but make 
me? sorry, for you bring me here twenty five days journey, 
and now you leave me go back alone; and which way 
shall 1 make my port alter, without^ de ship, without de 
horse, without pecune ? so he called money in his broken 
Latin. He then informed me, that there was a great ca- 
ravan of Muscovite and Polish merchants in the city, who 
were preparing to set out for Muscovy by land within six 
weeks : and that he was certain we would take this oppor- 
tunity, and coiiseciuently that he must go home by himself. 
Indeed this news infinitely surprised and pleased me. — 
Are you certain of this said I. “ Yes sir,” says he, 
“ me sure its true.” And so he told me that having met 
an old acquaintance of his, an Armenian, in the street, who 
was among them, and who had come from Astracan, with 
a design to go to Tonquin, but for certain reasons having 
altered his resolution, he was now resolved to go with the 
caravan, and to return by the river Wolga, to Astracan. — 
•* Well, Seignior,’ said I ** don’t be discontented about 
your returning alone : and if, by this mean«, lean find a 
passage to England, it will be your own fault if you return 
to Macao at all.” And so consulting with my jnirtner what 
was best to be done, he referred it to me to do as 1 pleased, 
having our affairs so well seliied at Bengal, that if he could 
convert the good voyage he had made in China silks, 
wrought or raw, he w'ould be satisfied to go to England, 
and so return to Bengal in the Company’s ship. Thus re- 
solved, we agreed that if our old pilot would go with us, we 
would bear his charges cither to Moscow or England ; and 
give him in a present the sum of one hundred and seventy 
pounds sterling. Hereupon we called him in, and told 
him the cause of his complaint should be removed, if he 
would accompany us with the caravans j and, therefore, we 
desired to know his mind. At this he shook his head. 
Great long journey,” said he, “ me no pecune carry * me 
lo Moscow, or keep me there.” But we soon put lum out 
of {hat concern, bv making him 'sensible of what we would 
give him here to lay out to the best advantage : and, as for 
his charges, we would set him safe on shore, God willing, 
atiher in Muscovy, or England, as he pleased, at our own 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 237 

chargee, except the carriage of his goods. As this proposal^ 
he was like a man transported, telling us, he would go with 
us all the world over; and we made preparations for our 
journey ; but it was near four months before nil the mer- 
chants were ready. 

In the mean time, my partner and the pilot went express 
to the port where we first put in, to dispose of what goods 
had been left there, •while 1 accompanied a Chinese mer- 
chant who was going to Nanquin, and there bought twenty- 
nine pieces of dcmnsk, with about three hundred more of 
other line silks ; and by the time my partner returned to 
Pekin, I had them all carried thither; our cargo in silks 
amounted to loOOOl. sterling, wiiich, together with tea, line 
calicoes, nutmegs, and cloves, loaded eighteen camels for 
our share, besides what we rode upon, with two or three 
s])arc liorse^, and two more loadeci w ith provisions ; the 
company now was very great, making about four hundred 
horse, and above one hundred and twenty men, well armed 
and provided. We were of several nations, among whom 
were live Scotch merchants, inhabiting in Moscow, and well 
experienced in trade. 

We set out from Pekin the beginning of February, our 
style ; and in two days more, we passed ihrougli the pte 
of the great China wall, which was erected as a fortifica* 
tion against the Tartars, being one hundred English miles 
long. We then entered a country not near so populous, 
cliielly under the power of plundering Tartars, several com- 
panies of wliom we perceived riding on poor starved horses, 
contemptible as themselves, without order or discipline.— 
One time our leader, for the day gave us leave to go a 
hunting ; but what do you think we hunted ? only a parcel 
of sheep, which indeed exceeded an\ in the worlcf for wild- 
ness and swiftness; but while we were pursuing this game, 
it was our chance to meet with al)oiit forty Tartars, who 
no sooner perceived us, but one of them blew a hom, at 
the sound of w hich there soon appeared a troop of forty or 
fifty more, at about a mil^ ilistancc. Hereupon one of 
the Scotch merchants (who knew their ways) ordered us to 
advance towards them, and attack them immediately. As 
we advanced, they let fly jpvolly of arrows, which fiappily 
fell a little short of us ; this made us hah a little, to retutu 
the compliment with bullets; and then being led up by

the bold Scot, we fired our- pistols in their faces, and drew 
out our swords ; but there was no occasion ; for they flew 
like timorous sheep, and only three of them remained, 
beckoning on the rest to come back. But our brave com- 
mander galloped up to them by himself shot one dead, 
knocked another ofl’ his horse, while the third ran away j 
md thus ended our battle w ith the Tartars. 

We travelled a month more through the Emperor Oa 
China’s dominions ; and at length coming to one of their 
towns about a day and a half s journey from the city ol 
Naum, 1 wanted to buy a camel. Tlie person I spoke to 
would have brought me one, but, like a fool I must go 
along with him, about two miles from the village. My 
old pilot and I walked on foot, forsooth, for some variety, 
when coming to the jdacc wliere the camels were kept as 
in a park guarded by Chinese soldiers, we tliere agreed 
and bought one, winch the Chinese man that came along 
with me led along the road. But we had not gone far, be 
fore we were attacked by five Tartars, meunted on horse- 
back, two of whom seized llie man, took the camel from 
him, and rode away, while the other three approached ns, 
the first of whom suddenly seized me as 1 was drawing my 
sword, the second knocked me down, but my ' old trusty 
Portuguese, taking a pistol out of his pocket, which I knew 
notliiug of, and coming up to the fellow that struck me, he 
witii one hand pulled him off his iiorsc, and then shot him 
dead upon the spot ; then taking his cimeter, he struck 
at the man that stopped us, but missing him, cut off one of 
his horse’s ears, tlie pain of wliich made him throw his 
rider lb the ground.. The poor Chinese who had led the 
camel, seeing the Tartar down, runs to him, and seizing 
upon his pole-axe, wrenched it from liis hands, and knocked 
his brains out. But there was another Tartar to deal with, 
who seeming neither inclined to fight or fly, and my, old 
man having begun to charge his pistol, the sight of it struck 
such a terror into the wretch, that away be scoured, leav» 
ing my old pilot, rather my champion and defender, an 
absolute victory. 

By this time being awakened from my trance, I began 
to open my ejes, wondering ^where I was, having quite 
forgot all that passed ; )>ut my senses returning, and feeling 
0 great pain in my head, and seeing the blood was running 
over my clothes,* 1 instantly jumped upon my feet, and

grasped my sword in iny hand^ with a resolution to take re- 
venge : but no enemies now lemuiiied, except the dead 
Tartar, with his horse slandii»g by him. The old tutu 
seeing ’me recovered, whom he thought slain, ran towards 
me, and embraced me with the greuu^st tenderness, at the 
same lime examining into my wounds, which was far from 
being mortal, ^^ ben we returned to the village, the man 
demanded [vayment •for iiis cun^l, which i refusing, we 
brought the cause before a Chinese judge, who acted with 
great impartiality ; having heard both aides, he asked the 
Chinese man that went with me, whose servant he waa ? 

Sir,” said he, “ I am nobody's, but went with the stran- 
ger at bis request:' “ What then," said the judge, you 
are the stranger’s servant for the time, ami tlie camel be 
ing delivered to his servant, it is liic same as though de; 
livered to himself, and accordingly he must pay for it.*’— 
Indeed the case was so fairly stated, that 1 had nothing to 
object to it ; so having paid for that 1 was robbed of, 1 
sent for another, but did not go myself to fetch it, as I bad 
enough of that sport before. 

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese empire, so 
furtilied^ as some will tell you, that millions of Tartars can- 
not batter down their walls ; by which certainly one might 
think one of our cantiODs would do more execution than all 
their legions. 

When we were within a day’s march of that city, wc 
had inforiuation tliat the governor had sent mestengem to 
everv part of the road, to inform the travellers and caravans 
to halt, till a guard was seut to protect them from the nu- 
racrous bodies of Tartars that lately ap})eared about the 
cit>. The news put us into great consteniation : but, 
obeving the orders, we stopt ^ and two days after, there 
came two hundred soldiers from a garrison of the Chinese, 
and three hundred more from Naum ; thus guarded both 
in the front and rear, with our own men in the hanks, we 
boldly advance, thinking we were able to combat with 
ten thousand Mogul Tartars if they appeared. 

Early next morning, in our march, from a little-well situ- 
ated town, called Changu, after having passed a river, and 
entered upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, 
we soon beheld by a cloud of dust that was rais^^i, that 
the enemy was approaching. This much dispirited the 
Chinese. Mv old pilot took notice of it. and called out,

LIFE AND ADVENTURES 


Seignior Inglise, those fellows must be encouraged, or they 
will ruin us all ; and 1 am afraid if the Tartars attack us, 
they will all run away.” Why, Seignior,” said I, what 
shall be done in this case “ Done,” says he, “ why let 
fifty of our men advance, and flank them on each wing. I 
know the fellows will fight well enough in company.” We 
accordingly took his advice, and marched fifty to the right 
wing, and the same nun^ber to the left, and with the rest 
made a line of reserve, leaving the last two hundred men 
to guard the camels, or to assist us, as occasion required. 

Thus prepared, a party of the enemy came forward, view- 
ing our posture, and traversing tlie ground on the front of 
our line. Hereupon we ordered the two wings to move 
on, and give them a salute with their shot ; which accord- 
ingly was done. This put a stop to their proceedings 
for immediately w heeling off to their left, they all marched 
away and we saw no more of them. Tliey had undoubtedly 
given an account to their companions of what reception 
they might expect, which made them so easily give over 
their enterprize. 

When we came to the city of Naum, we returned the 
^governor hearty thanks, and destributed a hundred crowns 
among the soldiers that guarded us. We rested there one 
day, and then proceeded on our travels, passing several 
great rivers and deserts ; and on the 13th of April we came 
to the frontiers of Muscovy, the first town of which w'as 
called Argun. 

This happy occasion, as 1 thought ot coming into a 
Christian country, made me congratulate the Scots mer- 
chant upon it. He smiled at that, telling me not to rejoice 
loo soon, ** for,” said he, ** except the Russian soldiers in 
garrison, and a few' inhabitants of the city upon the road, 
all the rest of this country, for above a thousand miles, is 
inhabited by the most ignorant and barbarous Pagans.” 

Vie advanced from the river Arguna by moderate jour- 
neys, and found convenient garrisons on the road, filled with 
Christian soldiers, for the security of commerce, and for 
the convenient lodgings of travellers : but the inhabitants of 
the country were mere Pagans, worshipping the sun, moon, 
and stars. We particularly observed this idolatry near the 
river Arguna, at a city inhabited by Tartars and Russians/ 
called Nertsinkey* Being curious ta see their ways of liv- 
ing, while the caravans continued to rest themselves in that

241 

city, I went to one of thei'r villages, where there was 
to he one of their solemn sacrihces. Tlierc I beheld, 
upon the stump of an old tree, an idol of wood, more ugly 
than the representation of the devil himself : its head 
resembling no living creature ; its ears were as big and aa 
high as goat's horns, a crooked nose, four-cornered mouti), 
and horrible teeth : it was clothed in sheep's skins, bad a 
great Tartar bonnet/ with two h6ms growing through it, 
and was eight feet high, without feet, legs, or proportioR. 
Before this idol there lay sixteen or seventeen people, who 
brought their offerings, and were making their prayers, 
while at a distance stood three men and one bullock, as 
victims to this ugly monster. 

Such stupendous sacrilege as this in robbing the true 
God of his honour, filled me with the greatest astonishment 
and reflection ; which soon turning to rage and fury, 1 
rode up to the image, and cut in pieces the lK>nnet that 
was upon his head with my sword, so that it hung dowii by 
one of the horns, while one of my men that was with me 
polled at it by bU sheep skin garment. Immediately an 
hideous howling and outcry ran through the village and 
two or three hundred people coming about our ears, we 
were obliged to fly for it. 

But Iliad not done wirh the monster; for the caravan 
being to rest three nights in the l(»wn, 1 told the Scots mer- 
chant what 1 had seen, and that 1 was resolved to take four 
or five men well armed with me, in order to destroy the 
idol, and show the people bow little rea.^on they bad to trust 
in a god who could not save himself. At first he laughed 
at me, representing the danger of it ; and when it was de- 
strove^, what time had we to preach to them better things, 
whose zeal and ignorance were in the greatest degrse, 
and both unparelleled ? that if I should betaken by them, 1 
should be served as a poor Russian who condemned theit 
worship ; that is, to be stripped naked, and tied to the top ' 
of tiie idol, there shot at with arrows till my body was rat 
of them, and then burnt as a sacrifice to the monster ; ** bat 
Sir/' said be, since your zeal carries you so far, rather

90 we three, aod my servant, resolved to execute this ex- 
ploit about midnight ; but upon second thoughts we defer- 
led it to the next night, by reason that the caravan being 
to go from hence the next morning, we should be out of 
the governor's powert The better to effectuate my design, 
I procured a Tartar's sheep skin robe, a bonnet, with bow 
and arrow, and every one of us got the like habits. The 
first night we spent in miffing, combustible matter with aqua- 
vitae, gunpowder, &c. having a good quantity of tar in a 
little pot ; the next night we came up to the idol about eleven 
o'clock, the moon being up. We found none guarding it j 
but we perceived a light in the house, where we had 
aecn the priests before. One of our men was for firing the 
hut, another for killing the people, and the third for ma- 
king them prisoners, while the idol was destroyed. We 
agreed to the latter ; so knocking at the door, we seized 
the first that opened it. and stopping his mouth and tying 
his feet, we left him. We served the other two in the like 
manner : and then the Scots merchant set fire to the com- 
position, which frightened them so much that we brought 
them all away prisoners to tlieir w'ooden god. There we 
fell to work witfi'him, daubing him all over with tar mixed 
with tallow and brimstone, stopping bis eyes, ears and, 
mouth full of gunpowder, with a great piece of wild-fire in 
his bonnet, and environed it with dry forage. All this be- 
ing done, we unloosed and ungagged the prisoners, and sei 
the idol on fire, which the gunpowder blowing up, the 
shape of it was deformed, rent, and split, which the forage 
utterly consumed : for we stayed to see its destruction, lest 
the ignorant, idolatrous people should have thrown them- 
selves into the fiames, And thus we came away undis- 
covered, in the morning appearing as busy among our fellow 
travellers, as nobody could have suspected any other, but 
that we had been in our beds all night. 

Next morning we set out, and bad go^e but a small 
distance from the city, when diere came a multitude of 
people of the country to the gates of the city, demanding 
satisfaction of the Russian governor for insulting their priests, 
and burning their great Cham Chi^'Tfaaungu, who dwelt, in 
the sun, and no mortal wouic^violate this image but some 
Christian miscreants ; and being already oo less than thirl^ 
t^usand strong, they announced war against him and 
his Christians. 



OF ROBINSON CRCSOl,

The governor a^sared them he was ignorant of the mat* 
ter, and that none of his garrison had been abroad j that in* 
deed there was a caravan that went awa^’ that morning, and 
that he would send after them to inqtiife into it ; and who- 
ever was the offender should be delivered into their hands. 
This satisfied them for llie present, but the governor sent 
to inform us, that if any of us had done it, w e should make 
all the haste away possible, while he kept tltem in play as 
long as he< could, t^poii this we marched two days and 
two nights, stopping hut very little, till at last we arrived 
at a village called Plothus, and hastened to Jarawetia, another 
of the Czar’s colonies. On the third day, having entered 
the desert, and passed the lake called Sliaks Oser, wc beheld 
a numerous body of horse on the other siilc of it to the 
north, w ho supposed we had passed on that side of the lake ; 
but either having found the mistake, or being certainly in- 
formed of the way we took they came ujion us t(/nar<ls the 
dusk of the evening, just as we had pitched our camp be- 
tween two little but very thick woods, with a little river 
running before our fnuit and some felled trees with wliiehi 
we covered our rear ; a precaution we always took, and 
wiiich we had just finished when the enemy came up.— 
They did not fall on ua immediately, but sent three messen- 
gers, demanding the men ^who had insulted their priests, 
and burnt their god Cham Clii-Tliaiingu, that they might 
be burnt with fire ; that if this was complied with, they 
would peaceably depart : but if not, they would de- 
Btrov one and all of us. Our men started at one another 
on receipt of this message, bo’ was the word, ns 

indeejl nobody knew it, but he who did it. Upon wiiich 
the leader of the caravan returned for answer, ** That Ihc^ 
were peaceable merchants, who meddled with none of their 
priests and gods ; and therefore desired them not to disturb 
us, and put us under the necessity of defending ourselves.** 
But so far was this from satisfving them, that the next moro- 
ing coming to ourrip^bt, they let fly a volley of arrows among 
us, which happily du! not hurt any, because we sheltered 
ourselves behind our baggage. Wc expected, however, Co 
come to closer engagement; but were happily saved by 
a cunniag fellow, a ^Maack, who obtaining leave of the 
leader to go out, mounts bis horse, rides directly from our 
rear^ and taking a circuit, comes up to the Tartars^ ns

story, that the wretch who had burnt the Cham Chi- 
Thaungu, were gone to Shiheilka, with a resolution to bum 
the god Shal-Isar, belonging to the Tongiiesgs. Upon which 
believing this cunning Tartar, who was a servant to our Mus- 
covite^, away they drove to Shiheilka, and in less than three 
minutes were out of sight, nor did we ever hear of them more. 

When we came to the city of Jarawena, we rested five 
days, and then entered into a frigh tfuf desert, which held us 
twenty-three days march, infested with several small com* 
panics of robbers, or Mogul Tartars, who never had the 
courage to attack us. After we had passed over this desert 
wc foufid several garrisons to defend the caravans from the 
violence of the Tartars : In particular the Governor of Adin* 
fikoy offered us a guard of fifty men to the next station, if 
we apprehended any danger. The people here retained 
the same paganism and barbarity, only they were not so 
dangerous, being conquered by the Muscovites. The cloth- 
ing, both of men and women, is of the skins of beasts, living 
under the ground in vaults and caves, which have com- 
munication w ith one another. They have idols almost in 
every family : besides they adore the sun and stars, water 
and snow ; and the least uncommon thing that happens in 
the elements, alarms them as much as thunder and light- 
lilng does the unbelievciug Jews. 

Nothing remarkable occured in our march through this 
countiy. When we had gone through the desert, after two 
days farther travel, we came to Jenezoy, a Muscovite city, 
on the great river so called, which we were told parted Eu- 
rope from Asia, The inhabitants here were very little bet- 
ter, though intermixed with the Muscovites, but the won- 
der will cease, w lien I inform my readers what was observed 
to me, that the Czar rather converts the Tartars with soldiers 
than clergymen, and is more proud to make them faithitil 
subjects, than good Christians. 

From the city of the river Oby, we travelled over a 
pleasant, fruitful, but very uncultivated country, for want 
of good management and people, and those few are 
Pagans. This is the place where the Muscovite criminals 
are banisMd to, if thev are not put to death. Iba next 
ci^ wa came to, was tne capital city of Siberia, called To-

rein-deer to carry us over the snow in the winter »ea 80 ii% 
the snow being frozen so hard, that the sledges can niQ 
upon the surface without any danger of going dowu. A« I 
was bound to England, I now behoved either to go with tll€ 
caravan to Jereslaw, from thence west to Nana, and tht 
gulf of Finland, and so by land or sea to Denmark ; or 
else i must leave the caravan at h little town on the Dwina» 
and so to Arciiangle, where 1 was certain of shipping either 
to England, Holland^ or Hamburgh. One night 1 happened 
to get into the company of an illustrious but banished Prince, 
whose company and virtues were such as made me propose 
to him a method how he might obtain bis liberty. — ** My 
dear friend,” said he, “ as I am here happily free from my 
miserable gioatiiess, with ail its attendants of pride, am* 
bitioo, avarice, and luxury, if I should escape from this place, 
those precious seeds may again revive, to my lasting di«* 
ouietude ; therefore let me remain in a blessed contiiiemeal^ 
for f am but tiesh, a mere man, nitli passions and atfecliosB 
as such : () be not my friend and tempter too !” Struck 
dumb with surprise, I stood silent awhile $ nor was he 
in disorder, by wiiicli perceiving he wanted to give vent lo 
his mind, 1 <lesired him to consider of it, and so withdrew'. 
But about two hours after he came to my aparlment : ** Dear 
friend/’ said he, though I cannot consent to accompany 
you, 1 shall have this satisfaction in parting, that )ou Icavtb 
me an honest man still ; but as a testimony of my atfection 
to you, be pleased to accept this present oi sables.” 

In return for his compliments, I scut my senant neat 
morning to his Lordship with a small prefleiit of tea, two 
pieces of China damask, and four little wedges of gold % 
but he only accepted the tea, one piece of damask, and ont 
piece of gold, for the curiosity of the Japan stamp that wii 
upon it. Not long after he sent for me, and told me thsl 
what he bad refused himself, he hoped, upon his account^ 1 
would grant to another, whom be should name ; In shaft it 
was his only son, who was about two bundled miles distant 
from him, on the other side of the city , %^om he said Im 
would send for, if I gave my sonseut. This 1 soon com* 
plied with ; upon which ht sent his servant next day fm 
his son, who returned in twenty days lime, bringing sefma 
horses loaded with valuable furs. At night the young Lord 
was coodacted incognito into our apartment, where nii

ther presented him to me. We then concerted the best 
ways for traveUing, and after having bought a considerable 
quantity of sables, black fox skins, fine ermines, Arc, 
(which I sold at Archangel at a good price,) we set out from 
this cily the beginning of June, making a small caravan, be- 
ing about thirty-two horses and camels, of which I repre- 
sented the head. My young Lord had with him a very 
faithful Siberian servant,* well acquainted with the roads. 
We shunned the principal towns and cities, as Tumen, Soli, 
Kafhoskoi, and several others, by reason of their strictness 
in examining travellers, lest any of the banished persons of 
distinction should escape. Having passed the river Kama, 
we came to a city the European side, called Soloy Ka- 
moskoi, where we I'oiuid the people mostly Pagans as before. 
We then passed a desert about two hundred miles over ; 
but in other ‘places it is near seven hundred. In passing 
this wild place, we were beset by a troop of men on horse- 
back, and about five and forty men armed with bows and 
arrows. At first they looked earnestly at us, and then 
placed themselves in our way. Wc were above sixteen 
men, and drew up a little line before our camels. My 
young Lord sent out his Siberian servant to know who 
they were j but when he approached them, he neither 
knew a word they said, nor would they admit him to come 
near them at his peril, but prepared to shoot him. At his 
return, he told us he believed them to be Calrauck Tar- 
tars ; and that there were more upon the desert. This was 
but a small comfort to us j yet seeing a little grove, about 
a quarter of a mile distance, w^e moved to it by the old 
Portugrese pilots advice, without meeting with any oppo- 
sition. Here we found a marshy piece of ground, and a 
spring of water running into a little brook on one side 
which joined another like it a little farther off, and these 
two formed the head of the river called Writska. As soon 
as wc arrived, we went to work, cutting great arms off the 
trees, and laying them hanging them not quite off from one 
tree to another. In this situation we w aited the motion of the 
enemy, without perceiving any advancement they made 
towards us. About two hours before night, b^ing joined 
by some others, in all about fou^kcore borsci'^ among wSom 
we fancied were some women, they came upon us with great 
iory. Wc fired without ball, calling to them in the Russian 
toAfoe, to know their business ; but they either not know-

wood-side, not considerins; that we were so fortified, as ihit 
they could not break in. Our old pilot, the Fortitguese, 
proved both our captain and engineer, and desired us not 
to tire till they came within pistol shot ; and when he gltie 
the word of command, then to take the surest aim ; but W 
did not bitl us give fire, till they were w ithin two pikes lengtil 
of us, and ilieu we (idled tourtecfli of them, wounded seve*

pieces with two or tliree bullets at least. So much were 
they surpri«=ed at our undauiitetiness, that thev retired about

our pieces again, and .sallying out, secured four or five of 
their horses, whose riders we found were killed, and per-

CHAP. I. 

OF SOLITUDE. 

However solitude is looked upon as a restraint to the 
pleasure of the world, in company and converstion, yet it 
u a happy state of exemption from a sea of trouble, an 
inundation of vanity and vexation, of confusion and disap- 
pointment. While wc enjoy ourselves, neither the joy nor 
sorrow of other men affect us ; We are then at liberty, 
with the voice of our soul, to speak to God. By this wc 
shun such frequent trivial discourse, as often becomes an ob- 
struction to virtue ; and how often do we find that we had 
reason to wish that we had not been in company, or said 
nothing when we were there ? for either we oflended God 
by the impiety of our discourse, or lay yursclves open lo the 
violence of designing people by our unguarded expressions ; 
and frequently feel the coldness and treachery of pretended 
friends, when once involved in trouble amd atfliction > of 
such unfaithful intimates, (1 should say enemies,) who rather 
liy fabe iouendoes would accumulate miseries upon us, tbaii 
Ihonestly assist us when under the hard hand of adversity, 
But in a state of solitude, when oEr tongues cannot be heard, 
SlTEcapt from the great Mqiesty of Heaven, bow happy are

above the envy and contempt of wickeii rocii. When a 
man converses with himself, he is sure that he does not 
converse with an enemy. Our retreat should be to good 
company, and good books. I mean not by solitude, dial 
a man should retire into a cell, a desert, or a monastery : 
which would be altogether an useless and unprohtabie re* 
straiot : for as men are formed for society, and have an 
absolute necessity and dependency upon one another, so 
there is a retirement of the soul, with which it converses ia 
heaven, even in the midst of men ; and indeed no man is 
more fit to speak freely, than ho wlic» can, without any 
violence to himself, refrain his tongue, or keep silence alto- 
gether. As to religion it is by this the soul gets acpiaint- 
ed with the hi(hien mysteries of the holy writings ; here 
she finds those floods of (ears, in which good men wash them* 
selves day and night, and only makes a visit to God, and 
his holv angehi. In this r<»iiversalion the truest peace and 
most solid joys are to l>e found ; it is a continual feast of 
contentment, on earth, and the lucans of attaining everlast- 
ing ha)>pmess in heaven. 


CHAF. II. 

OF HOI^ESTY. 

Honesty is a virtue beloved by good men, and pretended 
U) hv all other persons. In this there are several degrees; 
to pay every man his own is tin* c^onirnon law of honesty ; 
but to do good to all mankind, is the cliancCry law of ho- 
nesty • and this chancery court is in every luaifs lireast, 
where his conscience is a Lord Chancellor, llcnce it is, 
that a miser, though he pays every body their own, canool 
be an honest man, when he does not discharge the good 
otfices that are incumbent on a friendly, kind, and generoua 
person: for, saith the prophet Isaiah, chap, xxxii. vet. 7» 

“ The instruments of a chur are evil: he deviselh wicked, 
devices to <lestrr>y the poor with lying words, eve® when 
the needy speaketh right. ^But the lilieral soul deviselb 
liberal things, and bv liberal things shall he stand.’' It in

paid the utmost lartbing, iiang every malefactor without 
metcy, exact the penalty of every bond, and the forfeiture 
of every indenture, this would be downright cruelty, and 
not honesty ; and it is contrary to that general rule, “ To do 
to another that which you would have done unto you.’' 
Sometimes necessity ruukes an honest man a knave ; and a 
rich man an honest man, because he has no occasion to be 
a knave. The trial of honesty is this,: Did you ever want 
bread, and had } our neighbour s loaf in keeping, and would 
starve rather than cat it? Were you ever arrested, having 
in your custody another man’s cash, and would rathei go to 
gaol than break it? if so, tliis indeed may be reckoned ho- 
nesty. For King Solomons tells us, “That a good name is 
better than life, and is a precious ointment, and which 
when a man has once lost, he has nothing left worth keeping.” 

CHAP. III. 

0/ the present state of RELIGION in the World, 

1 DOITBT, hideed, there is much more devotion than reli- 
gion in the world ; more moderation than supplication ; and 
more hyjiocri.sy than sincerity : and it is very melancholy to 
eonsider, what numbers of people there are furnished with 
the powers of reason and gifts of nature, and }et abandoned 
to the greatest ignorance and depravity. But it woufid be 
uncharitable for us to imagine (as some papists, abounding 
with too much ill-nature, the only scandal to religion, do) 
tliat they will certainly be in a state of damnation after this 
life : or how can we think it consistent with the mercy and 
goodness of an infinite Being, to damn those creatures, 'when 
he has not furnished them w'ith the light of the gospel? or 
how can such proud, conceited, and cruel bigots, prescribe 
rules to the justice and mercy of God? 

We are told by some people, that the great image which 
King Nebuchadnezzar set up to be adored by his people, 
held the representation of the sun in his right-hand, as the 
principal object of adoration. But to wave this discourse of 
Heathens, how many self-contradicting principles are there 
Held among Christians ? and Itow do we doom one another 
:> the devil, while all profess to worship the same Deity, 
fidio expect the same salvation ? 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


251 

When I was in Portugal, thEre was held at that time the 
court of justice ef the inquisition. All the criminals were 
carried in procession to the great church, where eight of 
them were liablted in gow^ns and caps of canvas, whereon 
the torments of liell were displayed, and they were con- 
demned and burnt for crimes against the Catholic faith and 
blessed Virgin. 

I am sorry to raalft my reflections upon Christians ; but 
indeed in Italy the Roman religion seems the most cruel and 
mercenary upon earth j and a very judicious person, who 
travelled through Italy from Turkey, tells, ** That there is 
only the face and outward pomp of religion there: that 
the church protects murderers and assassians, and ihcii de* 
livers the civil magistrates over to Satan for doing justice ; 
interdicts whole kingdoms, and shuts up the churches for 
want of pa>ing a few* ecclesiastical dues, and so puts a stop 
to religion for want of their money: that the court of in 
(juisition burnt tw o men for speaking dishonourably of the 
blessed \ irgin ; and the missionary of China, loierated the 
worshipping tlic tievi! by their new converts ; that Italy 
was the theatre, where religion was the grand opera ; 
and that the polish clergy were no other than the stage 
players.” 

As to the religion in Poland, they deny Christ to be the 
Messiah, or that the Messiah has come in flesh. And 
as to their Pi<*testants, they are the hdlowers of Litdius So- 
cinus, who denied our Saviour’s divinity ; and have no con- 
cern about the divine inspiration of the Holy Cihost. 

In Muscovy, their churches are built of wood, and indeed, 
they have but wooden (iriests, tliough of the (ireek church ; 
they pray as much to saint as the Papists do to the 

Virgin Mary, for protection in alt their difliculties or afliic- 
lions. 

As to the Lutherans, they only differ from the Romans in 
believing consubstantation, instead of transuhstantatioii ; 
hut, like them, they are much pleased with the external gal- 
lantry and pomp, more than the true and real practice of it. 

Ill France 1 found a world of priests, the streets every 
where crowded with them, and the churches full of women ; 
but surely never was a natipn no full of blind guides, so ig* 
norant of religion, and even so void of morals, as those 
(leople who confess thetr sins to them.

Divine Being, there should be so maoir. diflfereat opinkms

as to the manner of paying him obedience in the Christian 
chuFch I I know not what reason to assign for this, except 
it be their different capacities and faculties. 

And, indecfd, upon this account, we have perceived, in 
all Christian countries, what mortal feuds have been about 
religion ; what wars and bloodshed have molested Europe, 
till the general pacification of the German troubles at the 
treaty of Westphalia ; and since those times, w hat persecu- 
tion in the same country among the churches of the Luthe- 
rans ; and should I take a prospect at home, what unhappy 
division are between Christians in this kingdom, about 
Episcopacy and Presbytery ; the church of England and the 
Dissenters opposing one another like St. Paul and St. Peter, 
even to tlie face ; that is, they carry on the dispute to the 
utmost extremity. 

It might be a question why there are such differences in 
religious points, and why these breaches should be more 
hot and irreconcilable All the answer 1 can give to this, 
is, that we inquire more concerning the truth of religion, 
than any other nation in the world : and the anxious con- 
cern we have about it, makes us jealous of e\ery opinion, 
and tenacious of our own: and this is not Ik cause we are 
more furious and rash than other people ; hut the truth is 
wc arc more concerned about them, and being sensible that 
the Scripture is the great rule of faith, the standard for life 
and doctrine, wc have recourse to it ourselves, without sub- 
nitting to any pretended infalltable judge upon earth. 

There is another question pertinent to the former, and 
that is. What remedy can we apply to this malady ? And to 
this 1 must negatively answer. Not to be less religious, that 
we may differ the less. This is striking at the very root of 
all religious differences ; for, certainly, were they to be 
carried on with a peacable spirit, willing to be informed, 
our variety of opiuions would not have the name of differ- 
ences ; nor should we separate in comniunion of charity, 
though wc did not agree in several articles of religion. 

Nor is there a less useful question to start, namelv. Where 
will our unhappy religious differences end ? To which, I 
hope, I may answer, in Heaven ; there all unchristian and 
nnbrotherly differences will find a period ; there we shall 
anbrace man^’ a sinner, that here wc think it a dUhonour 
to converse with ; and perceive many a heart we hove bro- 
hai here with censures, reproaches, and revilings, made

whole again by the balm of the same lledcemer'e blood.— 
Here we shall perc*€i\e there have been other Hocks than 
tiiose of our fold ; that those we have excouiunicated have 
been taken into that superior communion ; and, in a word, 
that those contradicting notions and principles which we 
thought inconsistent with true religion, we shall then Hnd 
reconcilable to themselves, to one another, and to the foun- 
tain of truth. U an^^rnaii ask me,^Why our did'erences can- 
not be ended on earth ^ 1 answer, Were wc ail thoroughly 

convinced that then they would be reconciled, we would 
put an end to them before ; but this is impossible to be done; 
for as man’s certain cimvicticnis of truth are not equal to 
one another, or the weight or signiticancy of such veracity, 
so neither can a general etfeci of lliis atfair be expected on 
this side of time. 

Beibre I conclude this chapter, 1 shall beg leave to dis- 
course a little on the wonderful excellency of negative re- 
ligion and negative virtue. The latter sets out, like the- 
Pharisee, with — (iod, I thank thee ; it is a piece of religi- 
ous pageantry, the liyfioorite s hope : and in a word, it is 
positive vice; for it is either a mask to deceive others, or a 
mist to deceive ourselves. A man that i.s clothed with ne- 
gtitives, thus argues : I am not such a drunkard as iny land- 
lord, such a thief as iny tenant, such a swearer as iiis neigh- 
bour ; neither am 1 a cheat, an athiest, a rakish fellow, or 
H higliwa} man ; no! I live a sober, regular, retired life: I 
am a good man, I go to church , Ciotl, 1 ihuiik thee. Now, 
tbougit a man boast ol Ins virtue in eoniradic lion to the 
vices mentioned, vet a person had hetli r have them alto- 
gether than the mauhimstdfj for he is lull of himself; so 
persuaded that he is gooil and religious enough alreaily, 
that he has no thoughts of au> thing, except il he to pull off 
his hat to (iod Almighty now and Uicu, and thank him that 
has no occa.siou for him; ami has the vanity to think 
that hw neighbours must iiiiagim* well of him Uhi. 

The negative man, though he is no druiikarti, it yet in- 
toxicated with the pride of his own worth ; a good neigh- 
bour a'ui fieace-maker in other families, but a tyrant in hii 
own ; appears in a church for a show, but never falls upon 
his knees in his closst ; does all his alms before men, to be 
seen of them ; eager in the duties of the second tabic, b«t 
regardless of the first ; appears religious, to be taken noltce 
of by men, but without intercourse or conununkmtiott b#r

tween God and his own soul: Pray, what is this man? 
ctf what comfort is there of the life he lives ? He is insensible 
of faith, repentance, and a Christian mortified life : in a word, 
he is perfectly a stranger to the essential part of religion. 

Let us for a while enter into the private and retired part 
of his conversation : What notions has he of his mis-spent 
hours, and of the progress of time to the great centre and 
gulf of life, eternity ? Does he knovt' how to put a right 
value on time, or esteem the life-blood of his soul as it 
really is, and act in all the moments of it, as one that must 
account for them ? if then you can form an equality between 
what he can do and what he shall receive, less can be 
founded upon his negative virtue, or what he has forborne 
to do : And if neither his negative nor positive piety can 
be equal to the reward, and to the eternity that reward is 
to last for, what then is to become of the Pharisee, when 
lie is to he judged by the sincerity of his repentance, and 
rewarded, according to the infinite grace of God, with a 
slate of blessedness to an endless eternity ? 

When the negative man converses with the iiuisible 
world, he is filled with as much horror and dread as Felix, 
when St. Paul reasoned to him of temperance, righteous- 
ness, and of judgment to come ; for Felix, though a great 
philosopher, of great power and reverence, was a negative 
man, and he was made sensible by the Apostle, that, as a 
life of virtue and temperance was its own reward, by giving 
a healthy body, a clear hea<i, and a composed life, so eter- 
nal happiness must proceed from another spring : namely, 
the intiuite unbounded grace of a provoked God, who hav- 
ing erected a rigliteous tribunal, Jesus Christ would sepa- 
rate such as by faith and repentance, he bad brought Uome 
and united to himself by the grace of adoption, and on the 
foot of his having laid down his life as a ransom for them, 
had appointed them to salvation, when all his philosophy, 
temperance, and righteousness in the world besides had 
been ineffectual. Aud this, 1 say, it was, that made Felix, 
this negative man, tremble. 

CHAP. IV. 

Of Ihtening to the voice of Providence, 

The magnificient and wise king Solomon bids us cry after 
knowledge, and lift up our voice for understanding; by 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2^ 

which is meant, religious knowledge •, for it follows ; Then 
shalr thou understand the fear of the Lord, and hnd the 
knowledge of God.” By which undoubtedly he meant, to 
inquire after every thing he has permitted us to know, and 
not search into' those ways that are uncharitable, and are 
effectually locked up from our knowledge. — Now. as 
listening to the voice of Providence,” is my present subject, 
I intend, in the tirst place, to write to those who owu — 1. 
That there is a God, a first great moving cause of all things, 
an eternal power, prior, and conse(j|uently superior to all 
created power or being. — 2. That this eternal power, which 
is (jod, is the sovereign creator and governor of heaven and 
tuirth. 

To avoid all needless distinctions, what persons in the God- 
head exercises the creating, and what the governing power, 

I ofi’er that glorious text, Psal. xxiii. 6. wliere the whole 
Trinity is entitled to the whole creating work ; and therefore, 
in the next place, I shall lay down these two propositions : 

I. Tliat the eternal God guides, by his Providence, the 
whole universe, which was created by his power. 

II. That this Providence manifests a particular care over, 
and concern in, the governing and directing man, the most 
noble creature upon earth. 

It is plain, that natural religion proves the first, by inti- 
mating the necessity of a Providence guiding and govern- 
ing the world, from the consequence of the wisdom, justice, 
prescience, aud goodness of the Almighty Creator : for 
otherwise it would be absurd to think, That God should 
create a world, without any care or providence over it, in 
guiding the operations of nature, so as lo preserve the 
order of his creation. 

Revealed religion gives us a light into the care and con- 
cern of his providence, by the climate's being made habit- 
able, the creatures subjected and made nourishing, and all 
vegetative life made medicinal ; and all this for the sake of 
man, who Ls made viceroy to the King of the earth. The 
short description I shall give of Providence is this : ** That 
it is that operation of the power, of the wisdom, justice, 
and goodness of God, by which he influences, governs, and 
directs, not only the means, but the events of all things, 
which concerns us in (his sublunary world ; the sovereignty 
of which we ought always to reverence, obey its motions^ 
observe its dictates, and listen to its voice. The prudent 



266 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself ; that is, as I'take 
it, there is a secret Providence intimates to us, that some 
danger threatens, if we strive not to shun it.‘^ 

The same day that Sir John Hotham kept out Hull against 
the royal Martyr King Charles 1. the same day Sir John 
Hotham was put to death by the parliament for that very 
action : The same day that the King himself signed the war- 
rant for the execution of the Earl of Stafford, the same day 
of the month was he barbarously murdered by the blood- 
thirsty Oliverian crew : and the same day that King James 11. 
came to the crown against the bill of exclusion, the same 
days be was voted, abdicated by the parliament, and the 
throne fillcd'with King William and Queen Mary. 

The voice of signal deliverances from sudden danger, is 
not only a just call to repentance, but a caution against fall- 
ing into the like danger; but such who ate utterly careless 
of themselves after, show a lethargy of the worst nature, 
which seems to me to be a kind of practical atheism, or at 
least living in a contenipt of Heaven, when he receives 
good at the hand of his Maker, but is unconcerned from 
whence it comes, or to thank the bountiful hand that gave 
it ; neither, when he receives evil, does it altar his manner 
of Fife, or bring him to any slate of humiliation. 

We have a remarkable story of tw© soldiers being con- 
demned to death in Flanders. The (Tcneral being prevailed 
upon to spare one of them, ordered them to cast dice upon 
the drum-head for their lives ; ths iirst having thrown two 
sixes, the second fell a wringing his hands, having so poor a 
chance to escape ; however, having thrown he was surprised 
when be also threw other two sixes. The officer appointed 
to see the execution, ordered them to throw again ; they 
did so^ and each of them threw fives ; at which the soldiers 
that stood round, shouted, and said, neither of them was to 
die. Upon this, the officer acquainted the council of war, 
who ordered them to throw a third time, when they threw 
two fours : the General being acquainted with it, sent for 
the men, and pardoned them ; 1 love, said he, in such ex- 
traordinary cases, to listen to the voice of Providence, 

Wc read in the holy writings, how God speaks to men 
by appearances of angels, or by dreams and visions of the 
night. As God appeared to Abraham, Lot, and Jacob : 
•0 angels have appeared to many in other cases, as to Ma- 
nnan and his wife, Zachariah, the Virgin Mary, and to the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 257 

Apostles ; others have been warned in a dream, as King 
Abimelcha, the false prophet Balaam, and many others. 

It is certainly a very great and noble inquiry, “ What we 
shall be after this life for there is scarce a doubt that 
there is a place reserved for the reception of our souls after 
death ; for if we are to be, we must have a where, which 
the Scriptures ^sert ^y the examples of Dives and Lazarus. 
The doctrine of spirits was long “believed before our Sa- 
viour’s time ; for when the desciples of the blessed Jesus 
perceived our Saviour walking on the sea, they were aa 
much surprised as though they had seen a spirit. Nay, in 
those ages of the world, it was believed that spirits inter* 
meddled in the affairs of mankind ; and throughout the Old 
Testament, I do not find any thing tliat in the least con* 
tradicts it. All the pains and labour that some learned men 
have taken, to confute the story of the witch of Eiidor, and 
the appearances of an old man personating Samuel, cannot 
make such apparitions, inconsistent witb nature or religion ; 
and it is plain, that it was either a good or a bad spirit, that 
prophetically told the unfortunate king, what should happen 
the next day : for, said the spirit, “ The Lord will deliver 
thee into the hands of (he Philistines ; and to-morrow shall 
thou and thy sons be with me.*^ 

Abundance of strange notions possessed me, when I was 
in the desolate island ; especially on a moonshine oighl, 
when every bush seemed a man, and every tree a roan on 
horseback. When 1 crept in the dismal cave where tlm 
old goat lay expiring, whose articulate groans even resem* 
bled those of a man, how was I surprised ! my blood cliiL 
kd in my veins, a cold sweaty dew sat on my forehead, 
my ha.ir stood upright, and my joints, like Belshazzars 
knees struck against one another. And, indeed, though 1 
afterwards found what it was, the remains of this surprise 
did not wear off for a great while ; and I had frequently 
returns of those vapours on different occasions, and some- 
times witliout any occasion at all. 

One night, after having seen some appearance in the air, 
as 1 had just laid down in my bed, one of niy feet pained 
me 3 after that came a numbness, succeeded with a tingling 
in my blood ; when on a sudden 1 thought something aliva 
lay upon roe, from my knee to above half my leg. Up^

“ Lord,” said I aloud,/* surely the devil has been here. 
** Hold your tongue,” says Poll. I was then mad at the 
bird, and putting on my clothes, cried, ** 1 am terribly 
frightened.” What's the matter with you ?” says Poll. 
** You toad,” said I, ** i’ll knock your brains out.” ** Hold 
your longue,’^ cried he again, and so feel a chattering, 
and called Robinson Crusoe, as he did before. But after 
I had composed myself, and went to bed again, I began 
plainly to see it was a distemper that affected my nerves, 
and so my terrors vanished at once. 

How intelligences are given or received, we do not know ; 
nor are we sensible how they are conveyed from spirits em- 
bodied to ours that are in life j or, on the contrary, from us 
to them 5 the latter is certainly done without the help of the 
organs, and the former is conveyed by the understanding, 
and the retired faculties of the soul. 

The spirits, without the help of voices, converses j and 
the more particular discoveries of converse of the spirits, 
seem to me as follow : to wit, dreams, voices, noise, im- 
pulse, hints, apprehensions, involuntary sadness, &c. 

Dreams of old were the ways by which God himself w as 
pleased to warn men what services to perform and what to 
shun. Joseph was directed of God in a dream to go to 
Egypt; and so were the wise men warned in a dream to 
depart into their own country another way, to avuid the 
fury of Herod. I am not like those who think dreams are 
the mere .designs of a delirious head, or the relics of a day’s 
perplexities or pleasures ; but on the contrary, I must beg 
leave to say, 1 never met with any capital mischief in my 
life, but I had some notice of it by a dream ; and had I not 
been a thoughtless^ unbelieving creature, I might have taken 
many a warning, and avoided many of the evils I after- 
wards fell into, merely by total^neglect to those dreams. 

1 was once present at a dispute between a layman and a 
clergyman, upon the subjects of dreams. The first thought 
no regal'd should be gjveu unto them : that their coromuni- 
• t^tion for the uiviaible to the visible world was a mere 



OF ROBINSO;^ CRUSOE. 959 

chimera 5 without any solid foundation. For, first, said he, 
if dreams were from the agency of any prescient being, the 
motives would be more direct, and the discoveries more 
plain, and not by allegories and emblematic fancies, ex- 
pressing things imperfect and obscure. 2 . Since, with the 
notice of evil, there was not a power giyen to avoid it, it 
is not likely to proceed from a spif’it, but merely fortuitous. 

3. That the inconstancy of such notices, in cases equally 
important, proves they did not proceed from any such agent. 

4. That as our most distinct dreams had nothing in them of 
any significancy, it would be irrational and vain to think 
that they came from heaven. And, 5. That as men were 
not always thus warued or supplied with notice of good or 
evil, so all men are not alike supplied with them ; and what 
reason could we give, why one man or one woman should 
not have the same hints as another ? 

To all this the clergyman gave answer : 1 . That as to 
the signification of dreams, and the objections against them, 
and being dark and doubtful, they are expressed generally by 
hieroglvphical representations, simiiies, allusions, and figura- 
tive emblematic ways, by which means, for want of inter- 
pretation, the thing was not understood, and consequently, 
the evil not shunned. 2 . That we charge God foolish)^, 
to say, that he has given the notice or evil, without the 
power to avoid it ; for, if any one had not power to avoid 
the evil, it was no notice to him ; and it was want of giving 
due heed to that notice, that men first neglected themselves, 
and then charged the Judge of all the earth with iiyustice. 
3 . Thart we ought not to find fault with the inconstancy of 
these notices, but rather with our weak understandings, 
by pretending dreams, were not to be regarded, and negli- 
gent when the voice really spoke to us for our good* It is 
a mistake to say dreams have no import at all ; we* migliti 
with more reason, have suid, none that wc could perceive 
the reason of, owing to our blindness and supine negligenea, 
too scdfre at one time, and too much alarmed at another ^ 
so that the spirit, which we might be said to be conversing 
with in a dream, was constantly and equally kind and care- 
ful ; but our powers are not always in the same state of 
iKrtion, not equally attentive U, or rententive of the hints 
that were given. And* 4! To answer the last question. 
Why people are not equally supplied ? This seems to W 
no question ; for Providence iUelf might have some ihl^ in

the direction of it, and then that Providence might be li- 
mited by a superior direction ; that as to the converse of 
gpirite, he could not call it a stated converse : such a thing 
there was, but why there was so much of it, and no more, 
was none of his business, and that no such discovery bad 
ever yet been made to mankind. Nor were we to imagine 
less of waking dreams, trances, visions, noises, hints, im- 
pulses, and all the waking testimonies of an invisible world, 
and of the communication that there is between us and 
tliem, which commonly entertain us with our open eyes. 

One time my fancy soared on high, to see what disco- 
veries I could make in those clear regions. I found that 
such immense bodies as the sun, stars, planets, and moon, 
in the great circle of the lower heaven, are far from being 
found in the study of nature on the surface of tJie earth* 
Here I saw many things that we can entertain little or no 
notion of in a state of common life, and the emptiness of 
our notion, that the planets are liabitable worlds j that is, 
created like ours, for the subsistence and existence of man 
and beast, and the preservation of the vegetative and sensi- 
tive life : No, no ; this is, I assure you, a world of spirits j 
for here I saw a clear demonstration of Satan being the 
prince of the poiver of the air, keeping his court or camp, 
with innumerable angels to attend him ; but his power is 
not BO great as we imagine, he can tempt us to the crime, 
but cannot force us to commit ; Humanum est peccare, Nei- 
tiier has the devil power to force the world into a rebellion 
against heaven, though his legions are employed among 
savage nations, to set up their master for a god, who make 
the heathens c ither worship him in person, or by his repre- 
sentative, idols and monsters, with the cruel sacrifiejes of 
human blood. Now', as to the limitations of the devil’s 
po^er, you must understand, that, as there are numbers of 
evil spirits employed in mischief, so there are numbers of 
good angels sent from the higher and blessed abodes to dis- 
concert and oppose their measures j and this every C^istian, 
1 hope, believes, when he prays to God, the father of spi- 
rits, to give his angels charge over him while he slumber- 
Cth and sleepeth. For if by these preventing powers the 
d^vil was not restrained, the ^arth would be subjected tp 
dearth, droughts, and famine ; air infected with noxious 
ihtines ; and, in a word, mankind would be utterly destroyed, 
which might oblige put* Maker (if I may be allowed tile 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

expression) to the necessity of a new Jiatf or else have no 
more creatures to honour and worship him. 

As the devil never wanted insmuators, I sKaU^hserve 
that I learned a way how to make a man dream o^what 1 
pleased. For instance, let us suppose one to be souod 
asleep ; let another lay his mouth close tojMs ear, and whis* 
per any thing so softly, as not to ^awake him,- the sleeping 
man shall dream of what has been so whispered in his earn ; 
nay, I can assure you, those insinuating devils can do this 
even when we are awake, which I call impulses of the mind ; 
for from whence, but from these insinuators, come our cause- 
less passions, involuntary wickedness, or sinful desires ? Who 
else from ideas in the mind of man when be is asleep, or prew 
sent terrible or beautiful figures to his fancy ? Mr. Milton 
represents the devil tempting Eve in the shape of a toad, 
lying just at her ear, when in her bower she lay fast asleep; 
and brings in Eve telling Adam what an uneasy night*s 
rest she had, and relating her dream to him. And likewise 
I believe that good spirits have the same intercourse with 
us, in warning us against those things that a^e evil, and 
prompting us to that which is good. 

Were we to have the eyes of our souls opened, through 
the eyes of our bodies, we should see this very immediate 
region of air which breathe in thronged with spirita 
now invisible, and which otherwise would be the moat ter- 
rible ; we should view the secret transactions of those roas^ 
sengers who are employed when the parting soul takes its 
leave of the reluctant body, and perhaps see things Nature 
vvould shrink back from with the utmost terror and amase- 
ment. In a word, the curtain of Providence for the dis- 
position of things here, and the curtain of judgment for the 
determination of the state of souls hereafter, would be alike 
drawn back ; and what heart could support bere.i^ future 
state of life much less that of its future state after life, 
even good or bad. 

A g^lcman of my acquaintance, being about seven miles 
distadt from London, a friend that came to dine with him, 
solicited him to go to the city. What/' said the gentle* 
man, “ is there any occasion fo roe “ No, Sir/' said the 
other, nothing at all, exdqd^e enjoyment of your good 
company and so gave ^er importuning him. Just tloil 
a strong impulse of mind urged the gentleman, and putauid 
liim like a voice, with, Go to L^don, Go to Loodonr^

Hark ye/’ says he to his friend, ‘‘ is all well at London ? 
Am I v anted there ? Or, did you ask me to go with you on 
any parti(?ular account ? Atc all my family well ?” Yes, 
indeed, ^•^ir,” said he, “ 1 perceived them all very hearty j 
and I did not ask you to go to London upon any particular 
account whatso<»ver, except it was for the sake of your good 
company.*’ ‘A^ain he put off his resolution ; but still the 
impulse suggested to him, “ Go to London and at length 
lie did so. When he came there, he found a letter, and a 
messenger had been there to seek him, and to tell him of a 
particular business, which was at first and last abo^c a thou- 
sand pounds to liim, and which might inevitably have been 
lost, had he not gone to London that night. 

The obeying of several hints, or secret impulses, argues 
great wisdom. 1 knew a man that was under misfortunes, 
beingf guilty of misdemeanors against the governnient : 
when, absconding for fear of his ruin, all his friends advis- 
ing him not to put himself into the hands of the law, one 
morning as he awaked, he felt a strong impulse darting into 
his mind thus, Write a letter to them; and this was 
repeated several times to his mind, aind at last answered 
to it, as if it had been a voice, ** Whom shall I write to?” 
Immediately it replied, “ Write to the Judge and this 
impulse pursued him for several days, till at length Ik* took 
pen, ink, and paper, and sat down to write to him : when 
immediately words flowed from his pen like streams from 
a fair fountain, that charmed even himself with hopes of 
success. In short, the letter was so strenuous in argument, 
so pathetic in its clo(|uence, and so persuasively moving, 
that when th« judge had read it, he sent him an answer, he 
might be easy, he would endeavour to make that matter 
light to him : and indeed, never left exerting himself till 
he had s.^opt the prosecution, and restored him to his liberty 
and famil 

While i am mentioning these things, methinks it is M y 
hard that we should obey the whispers of evil spirirs, and 
not much rather receive the notices which good ones are 
pleased to give. We never perceive tlie misfortune of this, 
but when in real danger, and 11190 we cry “ My mind mis- 
gave me when I was going av,'»fs,^it but if so why do }ou 
slight the caution ? Why not listen tail as to a voice ? and 
then there had been no reason to make this complaint.
