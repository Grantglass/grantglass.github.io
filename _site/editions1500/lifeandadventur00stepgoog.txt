ROBINSON CRUSOB 
W. P. I 



PREFACE. 



The Story of Robinson Crusoe is founded on fact. It was 
written by an Englishman, Daniel Defoe, who lived from 1661 
to 1731. During his lifetime reports were common in England 
of castaways on the newly settled continent of America and 
its outlying Islands, and marvelous stories were told of the 
shifts such men had made to live. We have accounts of two 
men who, at different times, lived alone for years on the island 
of Juan Femandez, off the coast of Chile. One was an Indian 
who was left there from 1681 to 1684, and whose adventures 
were described by Captain Dampier, the buccaneer, in his 
" New Voyage round the World." The other was the cele- 
brated Alexander Selkirk, a Scotchman, who was rescued in 
February, 1709, after a stay of four years and four months, 
according to Captain Woodes Rogers. Defoe-s work shows 
some striking resemblances to both these accounts; and there 
is even a legend that our author once visited Selkirk at Bath. 

The island which Defoe describes cannot, however, be in any 
way identified with Juan Femandez. He himself says (on pp. 
39, 187) that it is near the mouth of the Orinoco. In this 
wise it answers to the island now called Tobago, as well as in 
such particulars as its distance from the mainland, its relation 
to the island of Trinidad (p. 187), and the indraft or current 
of the sea, of which Defoe makes mention. This island is also 
not wanting in a legend of a castaway, for there is an account 

5 



6 

of the finding of a solitary Frenchman who said he had lived 
there alone twenty-one years. 

The storm which is described as striking Crusoe's ship was 
a characteristic West Indian hurricane, the hke of which still 
sweep over those seas. Defoe had a large and exact geograph- 
ica! knowledge of all the lands which at his time had been ex- 
plored and settled. He knew not only the position and extent 
of each, but also the climate, the nature of the soil, the prod- 
ucts and their commercial values. 

While the story of Robinson Crusoe is thus based on actual 
events, it is none the less a product of Defoe's creative genius. 
His imagination seized a few experiences of Selkirk, or other 
castaways, and from them constructed this narrative of the 
stniggles made by an active, energetic man forced to a lonely 
life. In writing of Crusoe's zeal, Crusoe's religious fervor, and 
Crusoe's untiring industry, Defoe wrote of himself and what he 
himself would have been upon Crusoe's island and in his soU- 
tüde. It is such vigor, pluck, perseverance, and will as Crusoe's 
that have carried the EngUsh nation and English tongue to 
every part of the earth and given them practically the con- 
quest of the world. 

In Order to adapt this book to school purposes, the story is 
divided into short chapters, long sentences are split up into 
shorter ones, — by punctuation, for the most part, — antiquated 
expressions are either explained in footnotes or replaced by 
their modern equivalents, and a number of unessential passages 
are omitted, as well as most of Crusoe's adventures after leaving 
the island. Defoe's work, however, is otherwise unaltered, and 
retains all the essential characteristics of the first edition of 1719. 



THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



o>»?o 



CHAPTER L 

I WAS bom in the year 1632, in the city of York. Being the 
third son of the family, and not bred to any trade, my head began 
to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My father, who 
was very old, had given me a competent share of leaming, as far 
as house education and a country free school generally go, and 
designed me for the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing 
but going to sea. My inclination to this led me so strongly against 
the will, nay, the commands of my fäther, and against all the 
6ntreaties and persuasions of my mother and other friends, that 
there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity of nature, 
tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me. 

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent 
counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me 
one moming into his Chamber, where he was confined by the gout, 
and expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject. He 
asked me what reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, 
I had for leaving my father's house and my native country, where 
I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my for- 
tune by application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure.

After this he pressed me.earaestly, and in the most affectionate 
manner, not to play the young man, nor to hasten to miseries 
which nature, and the Station of hfe I was born in, seemed to have 
provided against. He told me that I was under no necessity of 
seeking my bread, that he would do well for me, and that if I was 
not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate or 
fault that must hinder it, and that he should have nothing to 
answer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against 
measures which he knew would be to my hurt j in a word, that as 
he would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at 
home as he directed, so he would not have so much hand in my 
misfortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away; and 
he would venture to say that if I did take this foolish step, God 
would not bless me, and I should have leisure hereafter to reflect 
upon having neglected his counsel, when there might be none to 
assist in my recovery. 

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly 
prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so 
himself — I say, I observed the tears run down his face very 
plentifully, and that when he spoke of my having leisure to 
repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved that he broke 
off the discourse, and told me his heart was so füll he could say 
no more to me. 

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, and, indeed, who 
could be otherwise ? and I resolved not to think of going abroad 
any more, but to settle at home according to my father's desire. 
But alas ! a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any 
of my father's further importunities, in a few weeks after I resolved 
to run quite away from him. However, I did not act quite so 
hastily as the first heat of my resolution prompted ; but I took 
my mother at a time when I thought her a little more yielding 
than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so entirely 
bent upon seeing the world that I should never settle to anything 
with resolution enough to go through with it, and my father had 
better give me his consent than force me to go without it ; that I 



was now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice 
to a trade or clerk to an attoraey ; that I was sure if I did I 
should never serve out my time, but I should certainly run away 
from my master before my time was out, and go to sea ; and if 
she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad, 
if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go no more ; 
and I would promise, by a double diligence, to recover the time 
that I had lost. 

Though my mother refused to speak thus to my father, yet I 
heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, and 
that my father, after showing a great concem at it, said to her, 
with a sigh : " That boy might be happy if he would stay at home ; 
but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that 
ever was bom ; I can give no consent to it." 

It was not tili almost a year after this that I broke loose, 
though, in the mean time, I continued obstinately deaf to all pro- 
posals of settling to business. But being one day at Hüll, where I 
went without any purpose of making an elopement at that time, — 
I say, being there, and one of my companions being about to sail 
to London in his father*s ship, and prompting me to go with them 
with the common allurement of seafaring men, that it should cost 
me nothing for my passage, I consulted neither father nor mother 
any more, nor so much as sent them word of it; but leaving 
them to hear of it as they might, without asking God's blessing 
or my father's, without any consideration of circumstances or con- 
sequences, and in an ill hour, God knows, on the ist of September, 
1651, I went on board a ship bound for London. Never any 
young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or con- 
tinued longer, than mine. The ship was no sooner out of the 
Humber than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise in a 
most frightful manner ; and, as I had never been at sea before, I 
was most inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in mind. I 
began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how 
justly I was overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked 
leaving my father's house, and abandoning my duty. All the 



to 

good counsels of my parents, my father's tears and my mothet's 
entreaties, came now fresh into my mind; and my consciettce, 
which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has 
since, reproached me with the contempt of advice, and the breach 
of my duty to God and my father. 

All this while the storm increased, and the sea went very high, 
though nothing like what I. have seen many times since ; no, nor 
what I saw a few days after. But it was enough to affect me then, 
who was but a young sailor, and had never known anything of 
the matter. I expected every wave would swallow us up, and thät 
every time the ship feil down, as I thought, in the trough or hol- 
low of the sea, we should never rise more. In this agony of mind 
I made many vows and resolutions that if it would please God to 
spare my life in this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry 
land again, I would go directly home to my father and never sct 
it into a ship again while I lived ; that I would take his advice, 
and never run myself into such miseries as these any more. 

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the 
storm lasted, and indeed some time after. But the next day 
the wind was abated, and the sea calmer, and I began to be a 
little inured to it, although I was very grave for all thät day, 
being also a little seasick still. Towards night the weather 
cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming fine even- 
ing followed. The sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so 
the next moming ; and having little or no wind, and a smooth 
sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most 
delightful that ever I saw. 

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more seasick, 
but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so 
rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and 
so pleasant in so little a time after. And now, lest my good 
resolutions should continue, my companion, who had enticed me 
away, comes to me : "Well, Bob," says he, clapping me upon the 
Shoulder, " how do you do after it ? I Warrant you were fnghted, 
wer'n't you, last night, when it blew but a capful of wind ? " " A 



II 

capful d*yöu call it?" said I; "'twas a terrible stonn." "A 
storm, you fool you," replies he; "do you call that a storm? 
why, it was notbing at all; give us but a good ship and sea 
room, and we think nothing of such a squall of wind as that; 
but you're but a fresh-water sailor, Bob. Come, let us make a 
bowl of punch, and we*ll forget all that ; d'ye see what charming 
weather 'tis now?" 

To make short this sad part of my story, we went the way of all 
sailors ; the punch was made, and I was made half drank with it, 
and in that one night's wickedness I drowned all my repentance, 
all my reflections upon my past conduct, all my resolutions for the 
future. In a word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness of 
surface and settled calmness by the abatement of that storm, so the 
hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears and apprehensions of 
being swallowed up by the sea being forgotten, and the current 
of my former desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and 
promises that I made in my distress. 



CHAPTER II. 

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth 
Roads; the wind having been contrary and the weather calm, 
we had made but little way since the storm. Here we were 
obliged to come to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind con- 
tinuing contrary — namely at southwest — for seven or eight days, 
during which time a great many ships from Newcastle came into 
the same Roads, as the common harbor where the ships might 
wait for a wind for the river. 

The wind blew fresh and, after we had lain four or five days, 
blew very hard. However, the Roads being reckoned as good 
as a harbor, the anchorage good, and our ground tackle very 
strong, our men were unconcemed, and not in the least appre- 
hensive of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after 
the manner of the sea. But the eighth day, in the moming, the 



12 

wind increased, and we had all hands at work to strike our top- 
masts, and make everything snug and close, that the ship might 
ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed, 
and we shipped several seas, and thought once or twice our an- 
chor had come home ; upon which our master ordered out the 
sheet anchor, so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the 
cables veered out to the better end.^ 

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I 
began to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the 
seamen themselves. The master, though vigilant in the business 
of preserving the ship, yet as he went in and out of his cabin by 
me, I could hear him softly to himself say, several times, " Lord, 
be merciful tö us ! we shall be all lost ; we shall be all undone ! " 
and the like. During these first hurries I was stupid, lying still 
in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot describe my 
State of mind. I could ill resume the first penitence which I 
had so apparently trampled upon, and hardened myself against. 
I thought the bittemess of death had been past, and that thts 
would be nothing like the first; but when the master himself 
came by me, as I said just now, and said we should be all lost, 
I was dreadfully frighted. I got up out of my cabin and looked 
out ; but such a dismal sight I never saw. The sea ran moun- 
tains high, and broke upon us every three or four minutes ; when 
I could look about, I could see nothing but distress round us. 
Two ships that rode near us, we found, had cut their masts by 
the board, being deep laden ; and our men cried out that a ship 
which rode about a mile ahead of us was foundered. Two more 
ships, being driven from their anchors, were run out of the Roads 
to sea, at all adventures, and that not with a mast Standing. The 
light ships fared the best, as not so much laboring in the sea; 
but two or three of them drove, and came close by us, running 
away with only their spritsail out before the wind. 

Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of 

1 " Veered out," etc., i.e., let out their whole length ; the better end is the inner, 
or little-used end. 



13 

our ship to let them cut away the foremast, which he was very 
unwilling to do. But the boatswain protesting to him that if he 
did not the ship would founder, he consented ; and when they had 
cut away the foremast, the mainmast stood loose, and shook the 
ship so much they were obliged to cut that away also, and make a 
clear deck. 

Any one may jUjdge what a condition I must have been in at all 
this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a 
fright before at but a little. But I was in tenfold more horror 
of mind upon account of my former convictions, and the having 
retumed from them to the resolutions I had wickedly taken at 
first, than I was at death itself; but the worst was not come yet. 
The storm continued with such fury that the seamen themselves 
acknowledged they had never seen a worse. We had a good ship, 
but she was deep laden, and wallowed in the sea, so that the sea- 
men every now and then cried out she would founder. It was my 
advantage in one respect that I did not know what they meant by 
" founder," tili I inquired. However, the storm was so violent that 
I saw, what is not often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some 
others more sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting 
every moment when the ship would go to the bottom. In the 
middle of the night, and under all the rest of our distresses, one of 
the men that had been down to see, cried out we had sprung a 
leak; another said there were four feet of water in the hold. 
Then all hands were called to the pump. At that word, my heart, 
as I thought, died within me, and I feil backwards upon the side 
of my bed where I sat. However, the men roused me, and told 
me that I that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to 
pump as another ; at which I stirred up, and went to the pump, 
and worked very heartily. While this was doing, the master seeing 
some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm, were obliged 
to slip, and run away to the sea, and would come near us, ordered 
to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what 
they meant, thought the ship had broken, or some dreadful thing 
happened. In a word, I was so surprised that I feil down in a 



14 

swoon. As this was a time when everybody had his OMm life to 
think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me ; but 
another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside 
with his foot, let me He, thinking I was dead ; and it was a great 
while before I came to myself. 

We worked on ; but the water increasing in the hold, it was ap- 
parent that the ship would founder. It was not possible she could 
swim tili we might run into any port. The master continued firing 
guns for help ; and a light ship, that had ridden it out just ahead 
of US, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the utmost- 
hazard the boat came near us ; but it was impossible for us to get 
on board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side. At last the 
men rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, 
our men cast them a rope over the stem with a buoy to it, and 
then veered it out a great length, which they, after much labor and 
hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under our stem, 
and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us, 
after we were in the boat, to think of reaching their oMm ship. All 
agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore as 
much as we could; and our master promised them that if the boat 
was staved upon shore, he would make it good to their master. . So 
partly rowing, and partly driving, our boat went away to the north-, 
ward, sloping towards the shore almost as far as Wintertön Ness. 

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of 
our ship tili we saw her sink, and then I understood for the first 
time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea. I must 
acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told 
me she was sinking ; for from the moment that they rather put 
me into the boat, than that I might be said to go in, my heart was, 
as it were, dead within me, partly with fright, partly with horror 
of mind and the thoughts of what was yet before me. 

While we were in this condition — the men yet läboring at 
the oar to bring the boat near the shore — we could see, (when, 
our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore>) a 
great many people running along the Strand, to assist us when we 



15 

should come near ; but we made but slow way. At last we got in, 
and, though not without rauch difficulty, got all safe on shore, and 
walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate 
men, we were used with great humanity, as well by the magistrates 
of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by particular mer- 
chants and owners of ships, and had money given us sufficient to 
carry us either to London or back to Hüll, as we thought fit. 

Had I now had the sense to go back to HuU, and had gone 
home, I had been happy, and my father, as in our blessed 
Savior's parable, had even killed the fatted calf for me ; for, hear- 
ing the ship I went away in was cast away in Yarmouth Roads, 
it was a great while before he had any assurances that I was not 
drowned. 

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that noth- 
ing could resist ; and though I had several times loud calls from 
my reason and my more composed judgment to go home, yet I 
had no power to do it. Certainly, nothing but some decreed un- 
ävoidable misery, which it was impossible for me to escape, could 
have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings and persua- 
sions of my most retired thoughts. 

Having some money in my pocket, I traveled to London by 
land ; and there, as well as on the road, had many struggles with 
myself what course of life I should take, and whether I should go 
home CH* go to sea. 

As to going home, it immediately occurred to me how I should 
b'e laughed at among the neighbors, and should be ashamed to 
see, not my father and mother only, but even everybody eise. I 
remained some time, uncertain what measures to take, and what 
course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance continued to 
going home ; and as I staid awhile, the remembrance of the dis- 
tress I had been in wore off. As that abated, the little motion I 
had in my desires to retum wore off with it, tili I quite laid aside 
the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage ; and at last I went 
on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa ; or, as our sailors 
vulgarly called it, a "voyage to Guinea."

CHAPTER III. 

It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good Company in 
London, which does not always happen to such loose and mis- 
guided young fellows as I then was. I first got acquainted with 
the master of a ship who had been on the coast of Guinea, and 
who, having had very good success there, was resolved to go again. 
This captain taking a fancy to my conversation, which was not at 
all disagreeable at that time, and hearing me say I had a mind to 
see the world, told me if I would go the voyage with him I should 
be at no expense ; I should be his messmate and his companion ; 
and if I could carry anything with me, I should have all the advan- 
tage of it that the trade would admit ; and perhaps I might meet 
with some encouragement. 

I embraced the offer ; and entering into a strict friendship with 
this captain, who was an honest, plain-dealing man, I went the voy- 
age with him, and carried a small adventure with mej which, by the 
disinterested honesty of my friend the captain, I increased very 
considerably ; for I carried about forty pounds in such toys and 
trifles as the captain directed me to buy. These forty pounds I 
had mustered together by the assistance of some of my relations* 
whom I corresponded with ; and who, I believe, got my father, or 
at least my mother, to contribute so much as that to my first 
adventure. 

This was the only voyage which I may say was successful in all 
my adventures. This I owed to the integrity and honesty of my 
friend the captain ; under whom also I got a competent knowledge 
of the mathematics and the rules of navigation, leamed how to 
keep an account of the ship's course, take an Observation, and, in 
Short, to understand some things that were needful to be under- 
stood by a sailor. As he took delight to instruct me, I took delight 
to leam ; and, in a word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a 
merchant. I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold dust 
for my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my retum, 



17 

almost three hundred pounds ; and this filled me with those aspir- 
ing thoughts which have since so completed my ruin. 

Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too ; particularly, 
that I was continually sick, being thrown into a violent fever by 
the excessive heat of the climate; our principal trading being 
upon the coast, from the latitude of fifteen degrees north even to 
the line [equator] itself. 

I was now set up for a Guinea trader. My friend, to my great 
misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same 
voyage again, and I embarked in the same vessel with one who 
was his mate in the former voyage, and had now got the command 
of the ship. This was the unhappiest voyage that ever man made. 
Though I did not carry quite one hundred pounds of my new- 
gained wealth, so that I had two hundred pounds left, which I had 
lodged with my friend's widow, who was very just to me, yet I feil 
into terrible misfortunes. 

The first was this: our ship making her course towards the 
Canary Islands, or rather between those Islands and the African 
shore, was surprised in the gray of the moming by a Turkish 
rover of Sallee,^ who gave chase to üs with all the sail she could 
make. We crowded also as much canvas as our yards would 
spread, or our masts carry to get clear; but finding the pirate 
gained upon us, and would certainly come up with us in a few 
hours, we prepared to fight, — our ship having twelve guns, and 
the rogue eighteen. About three in the aftemoon he came up 
with US, and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, 
instead of athwart our stern, as he intended, we brought eight of 
our guns to bear on that side, and poured in a broadside upon 
him, which made him sheer off again, after retuming our fire, and 
pouring in also his small shot from near two hundred men whom 
he had on board. However, we had not a man touched, all our 
men keeping close. He prepared to attack us again, and we to 
defend ourselves. But laying us on board the next time upon our

piracies.

other quarter, he entered sixty meh upon our decks, who immedi- 
ately feil to cutting and hacking the sails and rigging. We plied 
theni with small Shot, half-pikes, powder chests, and such like, and 
cleared our deck of them twice. However, to cut short this mel- 
ancholy part of our story, our ship being disabled, and three of our 
men killed and eight wounded, we were obUged to yield, and were 
carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors. 

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I appre- 
hended ; nor was I carried up the country to the emperor's court, 
as the rest of our men were, but was kept by the captain of the 
rover as his proper prize, and made his slave, being young and 
nimble and fit for his business. At this surprising change of my 
circumstances, from a merchänt to a miserable slave, I was per- 
fectly overwhelmed. Now I looked back upon my father's pro- 
phetic discourse to me, that I should be miserable and have none 
to relieve me, which I thought was so effectually brought to pass 
that I could not be worse ; for now the hand of Heaven had over- 
taken me, and I was undone without redemption. But, alas ! this 
was but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as will appear 
in the sequel of this story. 

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his house, 
so I was in hopes that he would take me with him when he went 
to sea again, belle ving that it would some time or other be his 
fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portugal man-of-war, and that 
then I should be set at liberty. But this hope of mine was soon 
taken away ; for when he went to sea, he left me on shore to look 
after his little garden, and do the common drudgery of slaves 
about his house ; and when he came home again from his cruise, 
he ordered me to lie in the cabin to look after the ship. 

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method 
I might take to effect it, but found no way that had the least 
probability in it. Nothing presented to make the supposition 
of it rational ; for I had nobody to communicate it to that would 
embark with me, — no fellow-slave, no Englishman, Irishman, 
or Scotchman, there but myself. So for two years, though I 



19 

often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never had the 
least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice. . 

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself, 
which put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty 
again in my head. My patron lying at home longer than usual 
without fitting out his ship, which, as I heard, was for want of 
money, he used, constantly, once or twice a week, sometimes 
oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the ship's pinnace, and 
go out into the road a-fishing. As he always took me and young 
Maresco with him to row the boat, we made him very merry, and 
I proved very dexterous in catching fish ; insomuch that sometimes 
he would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth, 
— the Maresco, as they called him, — to catch a dish of fish for 
him. 

It happened one time that, going a-fishing in a calm moming, 
a fog rose so thick that though we were not half a league from 
the shore, we lost sight of it ; and rowing we knew not whither 
or which way, we labored all day, and all the next night When 
the moming came, we found we had puUed off to sea instead of 
pulling in for the shore ; and that we were at least two leagues 
from the shore. However, we got well in again, though with a 
great deal of labor and some danger ; for the wind began to blow 
pretty fresh in the moming. But we were all very hungry. 

Our patron, wamed by this disaster, resolved to take more 
care of himself for the fiiture ; and having lying by him the long- 
boat of our English ship that he had taken, he resolved he would 
not go a-fishing any more without a compass and some Provision. 
So he ordered the carpenter of his ship, who also was an English 
slave, to build a little stateroom, or cabin, in the middle of the 
longboat, like that of a bärge, with a place to stand behind it to 
steer and haul home the mainsheet ; and room before for a hand 
or two to stand and work the sails. She sailed with what we call 
a " shoulder-of-mutton " sail ; and the boom gibed over the top 
of the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and had in it room for 
him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat on, with some 



20 

small lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he thought 
fit to drink ; and his bread, rice, and cofTee. We went frequently 
out with this boat a-fishing ; and as I was most dexterous to catch 
fish for him, he never went without me. 

It happened one day that he had appointed to go out in this 
boat, either for pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors of 
some distinction in that place, and for whom he had provided 
extraordinarily, and had therefore sent on board the boat over 
night a larger störe of provisions than ordinary. And he had 
ordered me to get ready three fusees [small muskets] with pow- 
der and shot, which were on board his ship, for that they designed 
some sport of fowling as well as fishing. 

I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next 
morning, with the boat washed clean, her flag and pendants out, 
and everything to accommodate his guests. When by and by my 
patron came on board alone, he told me his guests had put off 
going, from some business that feil out, and ordered me, with 
the man and boy, as usual, to go out with the boat and catch 
them some fish, for that his friends were to sup at his house. 
And he commanded that as soon as I got some fish I should bring 
it home to his house. All which I prepared to do. 

This moment, my former notions of deliverance darted into my 
thoughts, for now I found I was likely to have a little ship at my 
command. My master being gone, I prepared to fumish myself, 
not for fishing business, but for a voyage; though I knew not, 
neither did I so much as consider, whither I should steer — any- 
where to get out of that place was my desire. 



CHAPTER IV. 

My first contrivance was to make a pretense to speak to this 
Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board; for I told 
him we must not presume to eat of our patron's bread. He said 
that was true ; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit, and 



21 

three jars of fresh water, into the boat. I knew wherc my patron's 
case of bottles stood, which it was evident, by the make, were taken 
out of some English prize, and I conveyed them into the boat 
while the Moor was on shore, as if they had been there before for 
our master. I conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the 
boat, which weighed above half a hundredweight, with a parcel of 
twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all of which were 
of great use to us afterwards, especially the wax to make candles. 

Another trick I tried upon him, which he innocently came into 
also. His name was Ismael, which they call " Muley," or " Moely ; " 
so I called to him : " Moely," said I, " our patron's guns are on 
board the boat; can you not get a Uttle powder and shot? It 
may be we may kill some alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for 
ourselves, for I know he keeps the gunner*s Stores in the ship." 
" Yes," says he, " 1*11 bring some ; " and accordingly he brought a 
great leather pouch, which held a pound and a half of powder, or 
rather more ; and another with shot, that had live or six pounds, 
with some buUets, and put all into the boat. At the same time I 
had found some powder of my master's in the great cabin, with 
which I fiUed one of the large bottles in the case, which was almost 
empty, pouring what was in it into another. Thus furnished with 
everything needful, we sailed out of the port to fish. The Castle, 
which is at the entrance of the port, knew who we were, and took 
no notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the port 
before we hauled in our sail, and set us down to fish. The wind 
blew from the north-northeast, which was contrary to my desire, 
for, had it blown southerly, I had been sure to have made the 
coast of Spain, and at least reached to the Bay of Cadiz. But my 
resolutions were, blow which way it would, I would be gone from 
that horrid place where I was, and leave the rest to fate. 

After we had fished some time and caught nothing, for when I 
had fish on my hook, I would not pull them up, that he might not 
See them, I said to the Moor, " This will not do ; our master will 
not be thus served ; we must stand farther ofF." He, thinking no 
härm, agreed, and, being in the head of the boat, set the sails. As 



22 

I had the helm^ I ran the boat out near a league farther, and then 
brought her to, as if I would fish. Then, giving the boy the heim, 
I stepped forward to where the Moor was, and making as if I 
stooped for something behind him, I took him by surprise with 
my arm under his waist, and tossed him clear overboard into the 
sea. He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called 
to me, begging to be taken in, telling me he would go all over 
the World with me. He swam so strong after the boat that he 
woüld have reached me very quickly, there being but little wind. 
Upon this I stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowl- 
in^ pieces, I presented it at him, and told him I had done him no 
hurt, and if he would be quiet I would do him none. " But," said 
I, " you swim well enough to reach to the shore, and the sea is 
calm. Make the best of your way to shore, and I will do you no 
härm ; but if you come near the boat I'U shoot you through the 
head, for I am resolved to have my liberty." So he tumed him- 
self about, and swam for the shore, and I make no doubt but he 
reached it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer. 

I could have been content to take this Moor with me, and have 
drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. When 
he was gone, I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said 
to him, "Xury, if you will be faithful to me, VW make you a 
great man ; but if you will not stroke your face to be true to me," 
that is, swear by Mahomet and his father's beard, " I must throw 
you into the sea too." The boy smiled in my face, and spoke so 
innocently that I could not distrust him. He swore to be faithful 
to me, and go all over the world with me. 

While I was in view of the Moor that was äwimming, I stood 
out directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward, 
that they might think me gone towards the Strait's mouth (as 
indeed any one that had been in their wits must have been sup- 
posed to do). For who would have supposed we were sailed 
on to the southward, to the truly barbarian coast, where whole 
nations of negroes were sure to Surround us with their canoes, and 
destroy us ; where we could not go on shore but we should be 



23 

devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages of human 
kind! 

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my 
Gourse, and steered directly south and by east, bending my course 
a little towards the east, that I might keep in with the shore. 
Having a fair, fresh gale of wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I made 
such sail that I believe by the next day at three o'clock in the 
afteraoon, when I first made the land, I could not be less than one 
hundred and fifty miles south of Sallee ; quite beyond the Emperor 
of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts, 
for we saw no people. 

Yet such was the fright I had taken of the Moors, and the dread- 
ful apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that I would 
not stop, or go on shore, or come to an anchor. The wind con- 
tinued fair tili I had sailed in that manner five days ; and then the 
wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also that if any of our 
vessels were in chase of me, they also would now give over. So 
I ventured to make to the coast, and came to an anchor in the 
mouth of a little river, I knew not what, nor where, neither what 
latitude, what country, what nation, or what river. I neither saw, 
nor desired to see any people ; the principal thing I wanted was 
fresh water. 

We came into this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on 
shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the country ; but as 
soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful noises of the 
barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not 
what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and 
begged of me not to go on shore tili day. " Well, Xury," said I, 
" then I won't ; but it may be that we may see men by day, who 
will be as bad to us as those lions." "Then we give them the 
shoot gun," says Xury, laughing, "make them run way." Such 
English Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves. However, 
I was glad to see the boy so cheerful. 

After all, Xury's advice was good, and I took it. We dropped 
our little anchor, and lay still all night. I say still, for we slept 



24 

none. In two or three hours we saw vast great creatures (we 
knew not what to call them) of many sorts come down to the 
seashore, and run into the water, wallowing and washing them- 
selves for the pleasure of cooling themselves ; and they made such 
hideous howlings and yellings that I never indeed heard the like. 

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but 
we were both more frighted when we heard one of these mighty 
creatures come swimming towards our boat. We could not see 
him, but we might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous 
huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a Hon, and it might be 
so for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to me to weigh the 
anchor and row away. "No," says I, "Xuiy; we can slip our 
cable, with the buoy to it, and go ofF to sea ; they cannot follow 
US far." I had no sponer said so, but I perceived the creature 
(whatever it was) within two oars* length, which something sur- 
prised me. However, I immediately stepped to the cabin door, 
and taking up my gun, fired at him ; upon which he immediately 
turned about, and swam towards the shore again. 

But it is impossible to describe the horrid noises and hideous 
cries and howlings that were raised, as well upon the edge of the 
shore as higher within the country, upon the noise or report of the 
gun, — a thing I have some reason to believe those creatures had 
never heard before. This convinced me that there was no going 
on shore for us in the night on that coast, and how to venture on 
shore in the day was another question, too ; for to have fallen into 
the hands of any of the savages had been as bad as to have fallen 
into the hands of the lions and tigers. At least we were equally 
apprehensive of the danger of it. 

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere 
or other for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat. When 
and where to get to it was the point. Xury said if I would let him 
go on shore with one of the jars, he would find if there was any 
water, and bring some to me. I asked him why he would go? 
Why I should not go, and he stay in the boat? The boy answered 
with so much afFection, as made me love him ever after. Says he. 



^5 

" If wild mans come, they eat me, you go way." " Well, Xury," 
Said I, " we will both go, and if the ' wild mans * come, we will kill 
them ; they shall eat neither of us." We hauled the boat in as 
near the shore as we thought was proper, and so waded on shore, 
carrying nothing but our arms, and two jars for water. 

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the Coming 
of canoes with savages down the river ; but the boy, seeing a low 
place about a mile up the country, rambled to it, and by and by 
I saw him come running towards me. I thought he was pursued 
by some savage, or frighted with some wild beast, and I ran for- 
ward towards him to help him. When I came nearer to him, I saw 
something hanging over his Shoulders, which was a creature that 
he had shot, hke a hare, but different in color, and longer legs ; 
however, we were very glad of it, and it was very good meat. 
But the great joy that poor Xury came with, was to teil me he had 
found good water, and seen no " wild mans." 

But we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for 
water, for a little higher up the creek where we were we found the 
water fresh when the tide was out, which flowed but a little way 
up. So we filled our jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed; 
and prepared to go on our way, having seen no footsteps of any 
human creature in that part of the country. 



CHAPTER V. 

As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very 
well that the Islands of the Canaries, and the Cape Verd Islands 
also, lay not far off from the coast. But as I had no Instruments 
to take an Observation to know what latitude we were in, and not 
exactly knowing, or at least remembering, what latitude they were 
in, I knew not where to look for them, or when to stand ofF to sea 
towards them ; otherwise I might now easily have found some of 
these Islands. But my hope was that if I stood along this coast 
tili I came to that part where the English traded, I should find 



26 

some of their vessels upon their usual design of trade, that would 
relieve and take us in. 

By the best of my calculation, that place where I now was must 
be that country which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco's 
dominions and the negroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by 
wild beasts, the negroes having abandoned it, and gone farfher 
south, for fear of the Moors, and the Moors not thinking it worth 
inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness; and, indeed, both for- 
saking it because of the prodigious number of tigers, lions, leop- 
ards, and other furious creatures which harbor there. So that 
the Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go like an 
army, two or three thousand men at a time ; and, indeed, for near 
a hundred miles together upon this coast we saw nothing but a 
waste, unfnhabited country by day, and heard nothing but howlings 
and roaring of wild beasts by night. 

Once or twice in the daytime, I thought I saw the peak of 
Teneriffe, being the high top of the mountain Teneriffe in the 
Canaries, and had a great mind to venture out, in hopes of reach- 
ing thither. But having tried twice, I was forced in again by con- 
trary winds, the sea also going too high for my little vessel. So 
I resolved to pursue my first design, and keep along the shore. 

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had 
left this place ; and once in particular, being early in the moming, 
we came to an anchor under a little point of land, which was pretty 
high, and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in. 
Xury, whose eyes were more about him than it seems mine were, 
calls softly to me, and teils me that we had best go farther off the 
shore ; " for," says he, " look, yonder lies a dreadful monster on 
the side of that hillock, fast asleep." I looked where he pointed, 
and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was a terrible great Hon 
that lay on the side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of 
the hill that hung as it were a little over him. " Xury," says I, 
" you shall go on shore and kill him." Xury looked frighted, and 
Said, " Me kill ! he eat me at one mouth ! " one mouthful he 
meant. However, I said no more to the boy, but bade him lie 



27 

still, and I took our biggest gun, which was almost musket bore, 
and loaded it with a good charge of powder and with two slugs, 
and laid it down ; then I loaded another gun with two bullets ; and 
the third (for we had three pieces) I loaded with five smaller bul- 
lets. I took the best aim I could with the first piece to have 
shot him in the head, but he lay so with his leg raised a little above 
bis nose that the slugs hit his leg about the knee, and broke the 
bone. He started up, growling at first, but, finding his leg broken, 
feil down again, and then got up upon three legs, and gave the 
most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was a little surprised that 
I had not hit him on the head ; however, I took up the second 
piece immediately, and though he began to move off, üred again, 
and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to see him drop 
and make but little noise, but lie struggling for life. Then Xury 
took heart, and would have me let him go on shore. " Well, go," 
Said I. So the boy jumped into the water, and taking a little gun 
in one band, swam to shore with the other band, and Coming close 
to the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot 
him in the head again, which dispatched him quite. 

This was game indeed to us, but it was no food ; and I was very 
sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature 
that was good for nothing to us. However, Xury said he would 
have some of him ; so he came on board, and asked me to give 
him the hatchet. " For what, Xury?" said I. " Me cut off his 
head," said he. However, Xury could not cut off his head, but 
he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a monstrous 
great one. 

I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin of him 
might, one way or other, be of some vakie to us ; and I resolved 
to take off his skin if I could. So Xury and I went to work with 
him ; but Xury was much the better workman at it, for I knew 
very ill how to do it. Indeed, it took us both the whole day, but 
at last we got the hide off, and spreading it on the top of our cabin, 
the sun effectually dried it in two days' time, and it afterwards 
served me to lie upon. 



28 

After this stop, we made on to the southward continually for 
ten or twelve days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which 
began to abate very much, and going no oftener to the shore than 
we were obliged to for fresh water. My design iii this was to 
make the River Gambia or Senegal, that is to say, anywhere about 
Cape Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some European 
ship. If I did not I knew not what course I had to take but 
to seek for the islands, or perish there among the negroes. I 
knew that all the ships from Europe which sailed either to the 
coast of Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this 
cape, or those islands. In a word, I put the whole of my fortune 
upon this Single point, either that I must meet with some ship, or 
must perish. 

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as 
I have Said, I began to see that the land was inhabited, and in 
two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon 
the shore to look at us. We could also perceive they were quite 
black, and naked. I was once inclined to go on shore to them ; 
but Xury was my better counsellor, and said to me, " No go, no 
go." However, I hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk to 
them, and I found they ran along the shore by me a good way. 
I observed they had no weapons in their hands, except one who 
had a long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that 
they could throw them a great way with good aim. So I kept at 
a distance, but talked with them by signs as well as I could, and 
particularly made signs for something to eat. They beckoned to 
me to stop my boat, and they would fetch me some meat. Upon 
this I lowered the top of my sail and lay by, and two of them 
ran up into the country, and in less than half an hour came back, 
and brought with them two pieces of dried flesh and some com, 
such as is the produce of their country, but we neither knew what 
the one or the other was. However, we were willing to accept it, 
but how to come at it was our next dispute, for I would not ven- 
ture on shore to them, and they were as much afraid of us. But 
they took a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore 



29 

and laid it down, and went and stood a great way off tili we 
fetched it on board, and then came close to us again. 

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make 
them amends. But an opportunity offered that very instant to 
oblige them wonderfully ; for while we were lying by the shore, 
came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took 
it) with great fury from the mountains towards the sea. Whether 
they were in sport or in rage, we could not teil, any more than we 
could teil whether it was usual or stränge ; but I believe it was the 
latter, because, in the first place, those ravenous creatures sel- 
dom appear but in the night ; and, in the second place, we found 
the people terribly frighted, especially the women. The man that 
had the lance or dart did not fly from them, but all the rest did. 
However, as the two creatures ran directly into the water, they 
did not offer to fall upon any of the negroes, but plunged them- 
selves into the sea, and swam about, as if they had come for their 
diversion. At last one of them began to come nearer our boat 
than at first I expected ; but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded 
my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury load both the 
others. As soon as he came fairly within my reach, I fired, and 
shot him directly in the head. Immediately he sank down into 
the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and down, as if he 
was struggling for life ; and so indeed he was. He immediately 
made to the shore ; but between the wound, which was his mor- 
tal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died just before he 
reached the shore. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor crea- 
tures at the noise and fire of my gun. Some of them were even 
ready to die for fear, and feil down as dead with the very terror; 
but when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the water, and 
that I made signs to them to come to the shore, they took heart 
and came, and began to search for the creature. I found him by 
his blood staining the water. By the help of a rope, which I slung 
round him, and gave the negroes to haul, they dragged him on 
shore, and found that it was a most curious leopard, spotted, and 



30 

fine to an admirable degree ; and the negroes held up their hands 
with admiration, to think what it was I had killed him with. 

The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and the noise 
of the gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains 
from whence they came; nor could I, at that distance, know 
what it was. I found quickly the negroes wished to eat the 
flesh of this creature, so I was willing to have them take it as 
a favor from me. When I made signs to them that they might 
take him, they were very thankful. Immediately they feil to work 
with him ; and though they had no knife, yet, with a sharpened 
piece of wood, they took off his skin as readily, and much more 
readily, than we could have done with a knife. They offered me 
some of the flesh, which I declined, pointing out that I would 
give it to them; but I made signs for the skin, which they gave 
me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their pro- 
visions, which, though I did not understand, yet I accepted. I 
then made signs to them for some water, and held out one of 
my jars to them, tuming it bottom upward, to show that it was 
empty, and that I wanted to have it fiUed. They called im* 
mediately to some of their friends, and there came two women, 
and brought a great vessel made of earth, and bumt, as I sup- 
posed, in the sun. This they set down to me, as before, and 
I sent Xury on shore with my jars^ and filled them all three. 



CHAPTER VI. 

I WAS now fumished with roots and com, such as it was, and 
water; and leaving my friendly negroes, I made forward for 
about eleven days more, without oifering to go near the shore, 
tili I saw the land run out a great length into the sea, at about 
the distance of four or five leagues before me. The sea being 
very calm, I kept a large offing ^ to make this point. At length, 

1 Here, distance ofif the shore ; more often, that part of the open sea off the 
shore. 



31 

doubling the point, at about two leagues from the land, I saw 
plainly land on the other side, to seaward. Then I concluded, 
as it was most certain indeed, that this was Cape Verd, and those 
the Islands called, from thence, Cape Verd Islands. However, 
they were at a great distance, and I could not well teil what I had 
best do ; for if I should be taken with a fresh wind, I might neither 
reach one er other. 

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the 
cabin, and sat down, Xury having the heim ; when, on a sudden, 
the boy cried out, " Master, master, a ship with a sail ! " The 
foolish boy was frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs 
be some of his master's ships sent to pursue us ; but I knew we 
were far enough out of their reach. I jumped out of the cabin, 
and immediately saw, not only the ship, but that it was a Portu- 
guese ship ; and, as I thought, was bound to the coast of Guinea, 
for negroes. But, when I observed the course she steered, I was 
soon convinced they were bound some other way, and did not 
design to come any nearer the shore; upon which I stretched 
out to sea as much as I could, resölving to speak with them if 
possible. 

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to 
come in their way, but that they would be gone by before I could 
make any signal to them. But after I had crowded to the utmost, 
and began to despair, they, it seems, saw, by the help of their 
glasses, that it was sotae European boat, which they supposed 
must belong to some ship that was lost ; so they shortened sail 
to let me come up. I was encouraged with this, and as I had 
my patron's flag on board, I made a waft of it to them, for a Sig- 
nal of distress, and fired a gun, both which they saw; for they 
told me they saw the smoke, though they did not hear the gun. 
Upon these Signals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for 
me ; and in about three hours* time I came up with them. 

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and 
in French, but I understood none of them. At last, a Scotch 
sailor, who was on board, called to me ; and I answered him, and 



32 

told him I was an Englishmaii, aiid that I had made my escape 
out of slavery from the Moors, at Sallee. They then bade me 
come on board, and very kindly took me in, and all my goods. 

It was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will believe, 
that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miser- 
able and almost hopeless condition as I was in. I immediately 
offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a retum for my 
deliverance. He generously told me he would take nothing 
from me, but that all I had should be delivered safe to me when 
I came to Brazil. " For," says he, " I have saved your life on 
no other terms than I would be glad to be saved myself ; and 
it may, one time or other, be my lot to be taken up in the same 
condition. Besides," said he, "when I carry you to Brazil, so 
great a way from your own country, if I should take from you 
what you have, you will be starved there, and then I only take 
away that life I have given. No, no," says he, " Seignor Inglese 
[Mr. Englishman], I will carry you thither in charity, and those 
things will help to buy your subsistence there, and your passage 
home again." 

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the Per- 
formance to a tittle ; for he ordered the seamen that none should 
touch anything that I had ; then he took everything into his own 
possession, and gave me back an exact inventory of them, that I 
might have them, even to my three earthen jars. 

As to my boat, it was a very good one ", and that he saw, and 
told melie would buy it 6f me for his ship*s use, and asked me 
what I would have for it. I told him he had been so generous 
to me in everything that I could not offer to make any price of 
the boat, but left it entirely to him. Upon this he told me he 
would give me a note of band to pay me eighty pieces of eight ^ for 
it at Brazil ; and when it came there, if any one offered to give 
more, he would make it up. He offered me also sixty pieces of 
eight more for my boy Xury, which I was loath to take. Not that 

1 A piece of eight is a Spanish dollar containing eight reals. The real is worth 
about Ave cents. 



33 

I was unwilling to let the captain have him, but I was very loath 
to seil the poor boy*s liberty, who had assisted me so faithfuUy in 
procuring my own. However,when I let him know my reason, he 
owned it to be just, and oifered me this medium, that he would 
give the boy an Obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned 
Christian. Upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to 
him, I let the captain have him. 

We had a very good voyage to Brazil, and I arrived in the Bay 
de Todas los Santos, or All Saints* Bay, in about twenty-two days 
after. And now I was once more delivered from the most miser- 
able of all conditions of life ; and what to do next with myself I 
was to consider. 

The generous treatment the captain gave me I can never enough 
remember. He would take nothing of me for my passage, gave 
me twenty ducats^ for the leopard's skin, and forty for the lion*s 
skin, which I had in my boat, and caused everything I had in the 
ship to be punctually delivered to me. And what I was wiUing to 
seil, he bought of me, such as the case of bottles, two of my guns, 
and a piece of the lump of beeswax, — for I had made candles of 
the rest In a word, I made about two hundred and twenty pieces 
of eight of all my cargo ; and with this stock, I went on shore in 
Brazil. 

I had not been long here before I was recommended to the 
house of a good, honest man, like himself, who had an " ingenio," 
as they call it ; that is, a plantation and a sugarhouse. I lived with 
him some time, and acquainted myself, by that means, with the 
manner of planting and making of sugar. Seeing how well the 
planters lived, and how they got rieh suddenly, I resolved, if I 
could get a license to settle there, I would turn planter among 
them ; resolving, in the mean time, to find out some way to get my 
money, which I had left in London, remitted to me. To this pur- 
pose, getting a kind of letter of naturalization, I purchased as much 
land that was uncultivated as my money would reach, and formed 
a plan for my plantation and settlement ; such a one as might be 

1 The silver ducat of the value of a dollar is probably meant here.

34 

suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive from 
England. 

I had a neighbor, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but bom of English 
parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such circumstances 
as I was. I call him my neighbor, because his plantation lay 
next to mine, and we went on very sociably together. My stock 
was but low, as well as his ; and we rather planted for food than 
for anything eise, for about two years. However, we began to in- 
crease, and our land began to come into order ; so that the third 
year we planted some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece 
of ground ready for planting canes in the year to come. But we 
both wanted help ; and now I found, more than before, I had done 
wrong in parting with my boy Xury. 

But, alas ! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no great 
wonder. I had no remedy but to go on. I had got into an em- 
ployment quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the 
life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my father's house and 
broke through all his good advice. If I resolved to go on, I might 
as well have staid at home, and neyer have fatigued myself in the 
World as I had done. And I used often to say to myself, I could 
have done this as well in England, among my friends, as have gone 
five thousand miles off to do it among strangers and savages, in a 
wildemess, and at such a distance as never to hear from any part 
of the World that had the least knowledge of me. 

In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the ut- 
most regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and then 
this neighbor; no work to be done, but by the labor of my 
hands ; and I used to say I lived just like a man cast away upon 
some desolate island, that had nobody there but himself. But how 
just has it been, and how should all men reflect that when they 
compare their present conditions with others that are worse, 
Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and be convinced 
of their former felicity by their experience ! 

I was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying on 
the plantation, before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that 



35 

took me up at sea, went back ; for the ship remained there, in 
providing his lading, and preparing for his voyage, nearly three 
months. When I told him what little stock I had lefl behind me 
in London, he gave me this friendly and sincere advice : " Sei- 
gnor Inglese," said he (for so he always called me), "if you will 
give me letters and orders to the person who has your money in 
London, to send your effects to Lisbon, I will bring you the pro- 
duce of them, God willing, at my return ; but, since human afFairs 
are all subject to changes and disasters, I would have you give 
Orders but for one hundred pounds Sterling, which, you say, is half 
your Stock, and let the hazard be run for the first ; so that, if it 
come safe, you may order the rest the same way ; and, if it mis- 
carry, you may have the other half to have recourse to for your 
supply." 

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I did 
as he desired ; and accordingly the gentlewoman with whom I had 
left my money delivered a hundred pounds to a merchant at Lon- 
don. The merchant, vesting this money in EngHsh goods, such as 
the captain had written for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon, 
and he brought them all safe to me to Brazil; among which, with- 
out my direction (for I was too young in my business to think of 
them), he had taken care to have all sorts of tools, ironwork, and 
Utensils necessary for my plantation, all which were of great use 
to me. 

When this cargo arrived I thought my fortunes made, for I was 
surprised with the joy of it ; and my good Steward, the captain, 
had laid out five pounds to purchase and bring me over a servant, 
under bond for six years* Service, and would not accept of any con- 
sideration, except a little tobacco, which I would have him accept, 
being of my own produce. 

Neither was this all ; for my goods being all English manufac- 
ture, such as cloths, stuffs, baize, and things particularly valuable 
and desirable in the country, I found means to seil them to a very 
great advantage ; so that I might say I had more than four times 
the value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor 



36 

neighbor, — I mean in the advancement of my plantation; for 
the first thing I did I bought me a negro slave, and a European 
servant also, — I mean another besides that which the captain 
broüght me from Lisbon. 



CHAPTER VII. 

You may suppose that after having lived almost four years in 
Brazil, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my 
plantation, I had not only learned the language, but had contracted 
acquaintance and friendship among my fellow-planters, as well as 
among the merchants at St. Salvador, which was our port. In my 
discourses among them I had frequently given them an account 
of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading 
with the negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the 
coast for trifles — such as beads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, 
bits of glass, and the Hke — not only gold dust, Guinea grains, ele- 
phants' teeth, etc., but negroes, for the service of Brazil, in great 
numbers. 

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on these 
heads, but especially to that part which related to the buying ne- 
groes, which was a trade, at that time, not only not far entered 
into, but, so far as it was, had been carried on by permission of 
the kings of Spain and Portugal, so that few negroes were bought, 
and those excessively dear. 

It happened, being in Company with some merchants and 
planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those things very 
earnestly, three of them came to me next moming, and told me 
they had been musing very much upon what I had discoursed with 
them of the last night, and they came to make a secret proposal 
to me. After enjoining secrecy, they told me that they had a mind 
to fit out a ship to go to Guinea ; that they all had plantations as 
well as I, and were straitened for nothing so much as servants ; 
that as it was a trade that could not be carried on, because they 



37 

could not publicly seil the negroes when they came home, so they 
desired to make but one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore 
privately, and divide them among their own plantations. In a 
Word, the question was whether I would go as their supercargo in 
the ship, to manage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea. 
They oifered nie that I should have my equal share of the negroes, 
without providing any part of the stock. 

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been made 
to any one that had not had a settlement and a plantation of his 
own to look after which was in a fair way of Coming to be very 
considerable, and with a good stock upon it But for me, that 
was thus entered and established, and had nothing to do but to 
go on as I h^d begun, for three or four years more, and to have 
sent for the other hundred pounds from England, and who in that 
time, and with that little addition, could scarce have failed of being 
worth three or four thousand pounds Sterling, and that increasing 
too, — for me to think of such a voyage was the most preposterous 
thing that ever man in such circumstances could be guilty of, 

But I, that was bom to be my own destroyer, could no more 
resist the ofFer than I could restrain my first rambling dqsigns when 
my father*s good counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told 
them I wpuld go with all my heart, if they would undertake to look 
after my plantation in my absence, and would dispose of it to such 
as I should direct, if I miscarried. This they all engaged to do, 
and entered into writings or covenants to do so. I made a formal 
will, disposing of my plantation and effects in case of my death, 
making the captain of the ship that had saved my life, as before, 
my universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of my effects as I 
had directed in my will ; one half of the produce being to himself, 
and the other to be shipped to England. 

In Short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects, and 
to keep up my plantation. Had I used half as much prudence to 
have looked into my own interest, and have made a judgment of 
what I ought to have done and not to have done, I had certainly 
never gone away from so prosperous an undertaking, leaving all 



38 

the probable views of a thriving circumstance, and gone upon a 
voyage to sea, attended with all its common hazards, to say 
nothing of the reasons I had to expect particular misfortunes to 
myself. 

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my 
fancy rather than my reasoh. Accordingly, the ship being fitted 
out and the cargo fumished, and all things done, as by agreement, 
by my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an evil hour, the 
ist of September, 1659, being the same day eight years that I went 
from my father and mother at Hüll in order to act the rebel to 
their authority, and the fool to my own interests. 

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons bürden, 
and carried six guns and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, 
and myself. We had on board no large cargo of goods, except of 
such toys as were fit for our trade with the negroes, such as beads, 
bits of glass, Shells, and other trifles, especially little looking-glasses, 
knives, scissors, hatchets, and the like. 

The same day I went on board we set sail, Standing away to the 
northward upon our own coast, with design to Stretch over for the 
African coast when we had reached about ten or twelve degrees of 
northern latitude, which, it seems, was the manner of course in 
those days. We had very good weather, only excessively hot, all the 
way upon our own coast, tili we came to the height of Cape St. 
Augustine ; ^ from whence, keeping fiirther off at sea, we lost sight 
of land, and steered as if we were bound for the isle Fernando de 
Noronha, holding our coast northeast by north, and leaving those 
isles on the east. In this course we passed the line in about 
twelve days* time, and were, by our last Observation, in seven 
degrees twenty-two minutes northern latitude, when a violent tor- 
nado or hurricane took us quite out of our knowledge. It began 
from the southeast, came about to the northwest, and then settled 
in the northeast, from whence it blew in such a terrible manner 
that for twelve days together we could do nothing but drive, and, 

1 The eastern extremity of Brazil. The course of the ship may be easily traced 
on a map. 



39 

scudding away before it, let it carry us whither ever fate and the 
fury of the winds directed. During these twelve days I need not 
say that I expected every day to be swallowed up ; nor, indeed, 
did any in the ship expect to save their lives. 

In this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of 
cur men die of fever, and one man and the boy washed over- 
board. About the twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the 
master made an Observation as well as he could, and found that he 
was in about eleven degrees north latitude, but that he was twenty- 
two degrees of longitude farther west from Cape St. Augustine ; so 
that he found he was upon the coast of Guiana, on the north part 
of Brazil, beyond the river Amazon, towards that of the river 
Orinoco, commonly called the Great River, and began to consult 
with me what course he should take, for the ship was leaky, and 
very much disabled, and he was going directly back to the coast 
of Brazil. 

I was positively against that; and looking over the Charts of 
the seacoast of America with him, we concluded there was no in- 
habited country for us to have recourse to tili we came within the 
circle of the Caribbee Islands, and we therefore resolved to stand 
away for Barbadoes ; which, by keeping off at sea, to avoid the 
indraft ^ of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico, we might easily perform, as 
we hoped, in about fifteen days* sail ; whereas we could not pos- 
sibly make our voyage to the coast of Africa without some assist- 
ance both to our ship and to ourselves. 

With this design we changed our course, and steered away 
northwest by west, in order to reach some of our English Islands, 
where I hoped for relief. But our voyage was otherwise deter- 
mined; for, being in the latitude of twelve degrees eighteen 
minutes, a second storm came upon us, which carried us away 
with thesame impetuosity westward, and drove us so outof the way 
of all human commerce that, had all our lives been saved as to the 
sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than 
ever returning to our own country. 

1 The inward flow of the ocean current. 



40 

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men 
early in the morning cried out, " Land ! " We had no sooner run 
out of the cabin to look out, in hopes oi seeing whereabouts in the 
World we were, than the ship Struck upon sand, and in a moment, 
her motion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a 
manner that we expected we should all have perished imniedi- 
ately, and we were immediately driven into our close quarters, to 
shelter us from the very foam and spray of the sea. 

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like condition 
to describe or conceive the constemation of men in such circum- 
stances. We knew nothing where we were, or upon what land it 
was we were driven, — whether an island or the main, whether in- 
habited or not inhabited. As the rage of the wind was still great, 
though rather less than at first, we could not so much as hope to 
have the ship hold many minutes without breaking into pieces, 
unless the winds, by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately 
about. In a word, we sat looking upon one another, and ex- 
pecting death every moment, and every man, accordingly, prepar- 
ing for another world ; for there was little or nothing more for us 
to do in this. That which was our present comfort, and all the 
comfort we had was that, contrary to our expectation, the ship 
did not break yet, and that the master said the wind began to 
abate. 

Now, though we thought that the wind did a litde abate, yet 
the ship having thus Struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast 
for US to expect her getting off, we were in a dreadful condition 
indeed, and had nothing to do but to think of saving our lives 
as well as we could. We had a boat at our stern just before 
the storm, but she was first staved by dashing against the ship's 
rudder, and in the next place she broke away, and either sunk 
or was driven off to sea ; so there was no hope from her. We 
had another boat on board, but how to get her off into the sea 
was a doubtful thing. However, there was no time to debate, 
for we fancied the ship would break in pieces every minute, and 
some told us she was actually broken already. 



41 

In this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat, 
and with the help of the rest of the men got her slung over the 
ship*s side. Then, getting all into her, we let go, and committed 
ourselvesj being eleven in number, to God's mercy and the wild 
sea; for though the storm was abated considerably, yet the sea 
ran dreadfuUy high upon the shore, and might be well called 
" den wild zee," as the Dutch call the sea in a storm. 

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw 
plainly that the sea went so high that the boat could not live, 
and that we should be inevitably drowned. As to making sail, 
we had none, nor, if we had, could we have done anything with 
it. So we worked at the oar towards the land, though with heavy 
hearts, like men going to execution ; for we all knew that when 
the boat came nearer the shore, she would be dashed in a thou- 
sand pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we com- 
mitted our souls to God in the most eamest nianner; and the 
wind driving us towards the shore, we hastened our destruc- 
tion with our own hands, pulling as well as we could towards 
land. 

What the shore was, — whether rock or sand, whether steep or 
shoal, — we knew not. The only hope that could rationally give us 
the least shadow of expectation was if we might find some bay or 
gulf, or the mouth of some river, where by great chance we might 
run our boat in, or get under the lee of the land, and perhaps 
make smooth water. But there was nothing like this appeared, 
but as we made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked 
more frightful than the sea. 

After we had rowed or rather driven, about a league and a 
half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountainlike, came roll- 
ing astern of us, and plainly bade us expect the coup de grace} 
In a word, it took us with such a fury that it overset the boat 
at once ; and, separating us as well from the boat as from one 
another, gave us not time to say, " O God ! " for we were all 
swallowed up in a moment. 

1 The merciful last stroke. 



42 



CHAPTER VIII. 

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I feit 
when I sank into the water. Though I swam very well, yet I 
could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw breath, 
tili that wave having driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way 
on towards the shore, and having spent itself, went back, and 
left me upon the land, almost dry but half dead with the water 
I took in. I had so much presence of mind as well as breath 
left, that, seeing myself nearer the mainland than I expected, 
I got upon my feet and endeavored to make on towards the 
land as fast as I could, before another wave should return and 
take me up again. But I soon found it was impossible to avoid 
it ; for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill, and 
as furious as an enemy, which I had no means or strength to 
contend with. My business was to hold my breath, and raise 
myself upon the water, if I could ; and so, by swimming, to pre- 
serve my breathing and pilot myself towards the shore, if pos- 
sible, my greatest concem now being that the sea, as it would 
carry me a great way towards the shore when it came on, might 
not carry me back again with it when it gave back towards the 
sea. 

The wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty 
or thirty feet deep in its own body, and I could feel myself carried 
with a mighty force and swiftness towards the shore a very great 
way ; but I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still for- 
ward with all my might. I was ready to burst with holding my 
breath, when, as I feit myself rising up, so, to my immediate 
relief, I found my head and hands shoot out above the surface 
of the water. It was not two seconds of time that I could keep 
myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath and new 
courage. I was covered again with water a good while, but not 
so long but I held it out ; and, finding the water had spent itself 
and begun to return, I Struck forward against the retum of the 



43 

waves, and feit ground again with my feet. I stood still a few 
moments to recover breath and tili the waters went from me, 
and then took to my heels and ran, with what strength I had, 
further towards the shore. But neither would this deliver me 
from the fiiry of the sea, which came pouring in after me again ; 
and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and carried forward 
as before, the shore being very flat. 

The last time of these two had well-nigh been fatal to me, for 
the sea, having hurried me along as before, landed me, or rather 
dashed me, against a piece of a rock, and that with such force 
that it left me senseless, and indeed helpless as to my own deliver- 
ance. The blow taking my side and breast, beat the breath, as it 
were, quite out of my body ; and had it retumed again immedi- 
ately, I must have been strangled in the water. But I recovered 
a little before the return of the waves, and seeing I should be 
covered again with the water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of 
the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, tili the wave went 
back. Now, as the waves were not so high as at first, being 
nearer land, I held my hold tili the wave abated, and then 
fetched another nin, which brought me so near the shore that 
the next wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swallow 
me up as to carry me away. The next run I took, I got to the 
mainland, where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of 
the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger and 
quite out of the reach of the water. 

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up and 
thank God that my life was saved, in a case wherein there was, 
some minutes before, scarce any room to hope. I believe it is 
impossible to express, to the life, what the ecstasies and transports 
of the soul are when it is so saved, as I may say, out of the very 
grave. 

I walked about on the shore lifting up my hands, and my whole 
being, as I may say, wrapt up in a contemplation of my deliver- 
ance ; making a thousand gestures and motions, which I cannot 
describe ; reflecting upon all my comrades that were drowned, and 



44 

.that there should not be one soul saved but myself. For, as for 
them, I never saw them afterwards, or any sign of thera, except 
three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that were not fellows. 

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and 
froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far off; 
and I considered, Lord 1 how was it possible I could get on shore. 

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my 
condition, I began to look round me, to see what kind ol* place 
I was in, and what was next to be done. I soon found my com- 
forts abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance. I 
was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor anything either to eat or 
drink to comfort me ; neither did I see any prospect before me 
but that of perishing with hunger or being devoured by wild beasts. 
And that which was particularly afflicting to me was that I had no 
weapon, either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or 
to defend myself against any other creatures that might desire to 
kill me for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, 
a tobacco pipe, and a little tobacco in a box. This was all my 
provisions ; and this threw me into terrible agonies of mind, that 
for a while I ran about like a madman. Night Coming upon me, 
I began, with a heavy heart, to consider what would be my lot if 
there were any ravenous beasts in that country, as at night they 
always come abroad for their prey. 

All the remedy that ofFered to my thoughts at that time was to 
get up into a thick, bushy tree like a fir, but thorny, which grew 
near me, and where I resolved to sit all night, and consider the 
next day what death I should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of 
life. I walked about a furlong from the shore, to see if I could 
find any fresh water to drink, which I did, to my great joy ; and 
having drank, and put a little tobacco in my mouth to prevent 
hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into it, endeavored to 
place myself so that if I should sleep I might not fall. And having 
cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, for my defense, I took my 
lodging ; and being excessively fatigued, I feil fast asleep, and slept 
as comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in my condition.

CHAPTER IX. 

When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the 
storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before. 
But that which surprised me most was, that the ship was lifted off 
in the night from the sand where she lay by the swelling of the 
tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock which I at first 
mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the wave dashing me 
against it. This being within about a mile from the shore where 
I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself 
on board, that at least I might save some necessary things for my 
use. 

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked 
about me again, and the first thing I found was the boat, which 
lay, as the wind and the sea had tossed her up, upon the land, 
about two miles on my right hand. I walked as far as I could 
upon the shore to get to her; but found a neck or inlet of water 
between me and the boat, which was about half a mile broad. 
So I came back for the present, being more intent upon getting 
at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my present sub- 
sistence. 

A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed 
so far out that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship. 
And here I found a fresh renewing of my grief ; for I saw evidently 
that if we had kept on board we had been all safe, — that is to 
say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable 
as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and Company as I 
now was. This forced tears to my eyes again ; but as there was 
little relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship ; so 
I puUed off my clothes — for the weather was hot to extremity — 
and took the water. But when I came to the ship my difficulty 
was still greater to know how to get on board; for, as she lay 
aground, and high out of the water, there was nothing within my 
reach to lay hold of I swam round her twice, and the second 



46 

time I spied a small piece of rope, which I wondered I did not 
see at first, hung down by the fore chains so low as that with g^eat 
difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope I got up into 
the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the ship was bulged, 
and had a great deal of water in her hold, but that she lay so on 
the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stem lay 
lifted up upon the bank, and her head low, almost to the water. By 
this means all her quarter was free, and all that was in that part was 
dry ; for you may be sure my first work was to search, and to see 
what was spoiled and what was free. And, first, I found that all the 
ship's provisions were dry and untouched by the water, and being 
very well disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room and filled my 
pockets with biscuit, and ate it as I went about other things, for I had 
no time to lose. Now I wanted nothing but a boat to fumish myself 
with many things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me. 

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had ; 
and this extreraity roused my application. We had several spare 
yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a spare topmast 
or two in the ship. I resolved to fall to work with these, and I 
flung as many of them overboard as I could manage for their 
weight, tying every one with a rope, that they might not drive 
away. When this was done I went down the ship's side, and 
puUing them to me, I tied four of thera together at both ends, as 
well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or three short 
pieces of plank upon them crossways, I found I could walk upon 
it very well, but that it was not able to bear any great weight, the 
pieces being too light. So I went to work, and with a carpenter's 
saw I cut a spare topmast into three lengths, and added them to 
my raft, with a great deal of labor and pains ; but the hope of fur- 
nishing myself with necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what 
I should have been able to do upon another occasion. 

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight 
My next care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what 
I laid upon it from the surf of the sea. But I was not long con- 
sidering this. I first laid all the plank or boards upon it that I 



47 

could get, and having considered well what I most wanted, I first 
got three of the seamen*s chests, which I had broken open and 




emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft ; the first of these 
I filled with provisions ; namely, bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, 



48 

five pieces of dried goat's flesh (which we lived much upon), and 
a little remainder of European com, which had been laid by for 
some fowls which we brought to sea with us. There had been 
some barley and wheat together; but, to my great disappoint- 
ment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all. 
As for liquors, I found several cases of boUles belonging to our 
skipper, in which were some cordial waters, and, in all, about 
five or six gallons of rack. These I stowed by themselves, there 
being no need to put them into the ehest, nor any room for them. 
While I was doing this, I found the tide began to flow, though 
very calm ; and I had the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and 
waistcoat, which I had left on fhe shore upon the sand, swim 
away. As for my breeches, which were only linen, and open- 
knee*d, I swara on board in them and my stockings. However, 
this set me on rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough, 
but took no more than I wanted for present use, for I had other 
things which my eye was more upon, — as, first, tools to work 
with on shore. And it was after long searching that I found out 
the carpenter*s ehest, which was, indeed, a very useful prize to me, 
and much more valuable than a shipload of gold would have 
been at that time. I got it down to my raft, whole as it was, 
without losing time to look into it, for I knew in general what it 
contained. 

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There were 
two very good fowling pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols. 
These I secured first, with some powder horns and a small bag of 
shot, and two old rusty swords. I knew there were three barreis 
of powder in the ship, but knew not where our gunner had stowed 
them ; but with much search I found them, two of them dry and 
good ; the third had taken water. Those two I got to my raft, with 
the arms. And now I thought myself pretty well freighted, and 
began to think how I should get to shore with them, having neither 
sail, oar, nor rudder ; and the least capful of wind would have over- 
set all my navigation. 

I had three encouragements : a smooth, calm sea; the tide 



49 

rhing, and setting in to the shore; and what Utile wind there 
was blew me towards the land. And thus, having found two or 
three broken oars belonging to the boat, and, besides the tools 
which were in the ehest, two saws, an ax, and a hammer, with 
this cargo I put to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went 
very well, only that I found it drive a little distant from the place 
where I had landed before ; by which I perceived that there was 
some indraft of the water, and consequently I hoped to find some 
creek or river there, which I might make use of as a port to get 
to land with ray cargo. 

As I imagined, so it was. There appeared before me a little 
opening of the land, and I found a strong current of the tide set- 
ting into it ; so I guided my raft, as well as I could, to keep in 
the middle of the stream. 

But here I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, 
if I had, i think, verily, would have broken my heart. Knowing 
nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it upon 
a shoal, and not being aground at the other end, it wanted but a 
little that all my cargo had slipped off towards the end that was 
afloat, and so fallen into the water. I did my utmost, by setting 
my back against the chests, to keep them in their places, but 
could not thrust off the raft with all my strength ; neither durst I 
stir from the posture I was in; but holding up the chests with 
all my might, I stood in that manner near half an hour, in which 
time the rising of the water brought me a little raore upon a level. 
A little after, the water still rising, my raft fioated again, and I 
thrust her off with the oar I had into the Channel, and then 
driving up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a 
little river, with land on both sides, and a strong current, or tide, 
running up. I looked on both sides for a proper place to get 
to shore, for I was not willing to be driven too high up the river ; 
hoping, in time, to see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to 
place myself as near the coast as I could. 

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, 
to which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my raft, and 

RUB. CRU. — 4 



50 

at last got so near that, reaching ground with my oar, I could 
thrust her directly in. But here I had like to have dipped all 
my cargo into the sea again; for that shore lying pretty steep — 
that is to say sloping — there was no place to land but where 
one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would lie so high, and the 
other sink so low, as before, that it would endanger my cargo again. 
All that I could do was to wait tili the tide was at the highest, 
keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor, to hold the side of 
it fast to the shore near a flat piece of ground, which I expected 
the water would flow over. And so it did. As soon as I found 
water enough — for my raft drew about a foot of water — I thrust 
her upon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored 
her, by sticking my two broken oars into the ground, one on one 
side, near one end, and one on the other side, near the other 
end. And thus I lay tili the water ebbed away, and left my raft 
and all my cargo safe on shore. 



CHAPTER X. 

My next.work was to view the country, and seek a proper place 
for my habitation and where to stow my goods to secure them 
from whatever might happen. Where I was, I yet knew not; 
whether on the continent or on an island, whether inhabited or 
not inhabited, whether in danger of wild beasts or not. There 
was a hin not above a mile from me, which rose up very steep 
and high, and which seemed to overtop some other hills which 
lay as in a ridge from it northward. I took out one of the fowling 
pieces, and one of the pistols, and a hörn of powder ; and thus 
armed, I traveled for discovery up to the top of that hill where, 
after I had with great labor and difficulty got to the top, I saw 
my fate, to my great afiliction ; namely, that I was in an island 
environed every way with the sea. No land was to be seen ex- 
cept some rocks, which lay a great way off", and two small Islands, 
less than this, which lay about three leagues to the west. 



51 

I found also that the Island I was in was barren, and, as I saw 
good reason to believe, uninhabited except by wild beasts, of 
which, however, I saw none. Yet I saw abundance of fowls, but 
knew not their kinds ; neither when I had killed them could I teil 
what was fit for food and what not. At my Coming back, I shot 
at a great bird which I saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a 
great wood. I believe it was the first gun that had been fired 
there since the creation of the world. I had no sooner fired 
than from all parts of the wood there arose an innumerable num- 
ber of fowls, of many sorts, raaking a confused screaming and cry- 
ing, and every one according to his usual note, but not one of them 
of any kind that I knew. As for the creature I killed, I took it to 
be a kind of hawk, its color and beak reserabling it, but it had 
no talons or claws more than common. Its flesh was Carrion, and 
fit for nothing. 

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and feil 
to work to bring my cargo ön shore, which töok me the rest of 
that day. What to do with myself at night I knew not, nor in- 
deed where to rest, for I was afraid to lie dowa on the ground, not 
knowing but some wild beast might devour me, though, as I after- 
wards found, there was really no need for those fears. 

However, as well as I could, I barricaded myself round with the 
chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and made a kind 
of hut for that night's lodging. As for food, I yet saw not which 
way to supply myself, except that I had seen two or three creatures, 
like hares, run out of the wood where I shot the fowl. 

I now began to consider that I might yet get a great many 
things out of the ship which would be useful to me, and par- 
ticularly some of the rigging and sails, and such other things as 
might come to land ; and I resolved to make another voyage on 
board the vessel, if possible. And as I knew that the first storm 
that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I resolved to 
set all other things apart tili I had got everything out of the ship 
that I could get Then I called a Council — that is to say, in my 
thoughts — whether I should take back the raft ; but this appeared 



52 

impracticable, so I resolved to go, as before, when the tide was 
down. I did so, only that I stripped before I wient from my hut, 
having nothing on but a checkered shirt, a pair of linen drawers, 
and a pair of pumps on my feet. 

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second raft ; 
and, having had experience of the first, I neither made this so 
unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several 
things very useful to me. In the carpenter's Stores I found two or 
three bags füll of nails and spikes, a great screw jack, a dozen 
or two of hatchets, and, above all, that most useful thing called a 
grindstone. All these I secured, together with several things be- 
longing to the gunner, particularly two or three iron crows, and two 
barreis of musket bullets, seven muskets, another fowling piece, 
with sorae small quantity of powder more, a large bagful of small 
shot, and a great roll of sheet lead. But this last was so heavy 
I could not hoist it up to get it over the ship*s side. 

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could 
find, and a spare fore-topsail, a haramock, and some bedding. 
With this I loaded my second raft, and brought them all safe on 
shore, to my very great com fort. 

I was under some apprehension, during my absence from the 
land, that at least my provisions might be devoured on shore. But 
when I came back I found no sign of any visitor ; only there sat a 
creature like a wild cat upon one of the chests, which, when I 
came towards it, ran away a little distance, and then stood still. 
She sat very composed and unconcerned, and looked füll in my 
face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with me. I presented 
my gun at her, but, as she did not understand it, she was perfectly 
unconcerned at it, nor did she offer to stir away ; upon which I 
tossed her a bit of biscuit, though, by the way, I was not very free 
of it, for my störe was not great. However, I spared her a bit, I 
say, and she went to it, smelled at it, and ate it, and looked (as if 
pleased) for more ; but I thanked her, and could spare no more, 
so she marched off. 

Having got my second cargo on shore, — though I was fain to 



53 

open the barreis of powder, and bring them by parcels, for they 
were too heavy, being large casks, — I went to work to make me a 
little tent with the sail and some poles which I cut for that pur- 
pose. Into this tent I brought everything that I knew would spoil 
either with rain or sun ; and I piled all the empty chests and casks 
up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt, 
either from man or beast. 

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with 
some boards within, and an empty ehest set up on end without ; 
and spreading one of the beds upon the ground, laying my two 
pistols just at my head, and my gun at length by me, I went to 
bed for the first time, and slept very quietly all night, for I was 
V^ry weary and heavy ; for the night before I had slept little, and 
had labored very hard all day to fetch all those things from the 
ship, and to get them on shore. 

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid 
up, I believe, for one man ; but I was not satisfied still, for while 
the ship sat upright in that posture, I thought I ought to get every- 
thing out of her that I could. So every day at low water I went 
on board, and brought away something or other ; but particularly 
the third time I went I brought away as much of the rigging as I 
could, also all the small ropes and rope twine I could get, with a 
piece of spare canvas, which was to mend the sails upon occasion, 
and the barrel of wet gunpowder. In a word, I brought away all 
the sails, first and last ; only that I was fain to cut them in pieces, 
and bring as much at a time as I could, for they were no more use- 
ful to be sails, but as mere canvas only. 

But that which comforted me more still was that last of all, 
after I had made five or six such voyages as these, and thought I 
had nothing more to expect from the ship that was worth my 
meddling with, — I say, after all this, I found a great hogshead 
of bread, three large casks of rum, or spirits, a box of sugar, and a 
barrel of iine flour. This was surprising to me, because I had 
given over expecting any more provisions, except what was spoiled 
by the water. I soon emptied the hogshead of the bread, and 



54 

wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails, which I cut 
out ; and, in a word, I got all this safe on shore also. 

The next day I made another voyage, and now, having plundered 
the ship of what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the 
cables. Cutting the great cable into pieces such as I could move, 
I got two cables and a hawser on shore, with all the ironwork I 
could get ; and having cut down the spritsail yard, and the mizzen 
yard, and everything I could, to make a large raft, I loaded it 
with all these heavy goods, and carae away. But my good luck 
began now to leave me; for this raft was so unwieldy and so 
overladen that, after I had entered the little cove where I had 
landed the rest of my goods, not being able to guide it so.handily 
as I did the other, it overset and threw nie and all my cargo in?b 
the water. As for myself it was no great härm, for I was near the 
shore ; but as to my cargo, it was a great part of it lost, especially 
the iron, which I expected would have been of great use to me. 
However, when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of the 
cable ashore, and some of the iron, though with infinite labor ; 
for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued 
me very much. After this I went every day on board, and brought 
away what I could get. 

I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven 
times on board the ship, in which time I had brought away all that 
one pair of hands could well be supposed capable to bring ; though 
I believe verily, had the calm weather held, I should have brought 
away the whole ship, piece by piece. But preparing the twelfth 
time to go on board, I found the wind began to rise. However, at 
low water I went on board, and though I thought I had rummaged 
the cabin so effectually that nothing more could be found, yet I 
discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one of which I found two 
or three razors and one pair of large scissors, with some ten or a 
dozen of good knives and forks. In another I found about thirty- 
six pounds value in money, — some European coin, some Brazil, 
some pieces of eight, some gold, and some silver. 

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. " O drug ! " said 



55 

I, aloudy " what art thou good for? Thou art not worth to me — 
no, not the taking off the ground. One of those knives is worth all 
this heap. I have no manner of iise for thee ; e'en remain where 
thou arty and go to the bottom, as a creature whose life is not 
worth saving." However, upon second thoughts, I took it away ; 
and, wrapping all this in a piece of canvas, I began to think of 
making another raft. But while I was preparing this, I found the 
sky overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an 
hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently occurred to 
me that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind 
off shore, and that it was my business to be gone before the flood 
of tide began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore 
at all. Accordingly I let myself down into the water, and swam 
across the Channel which lay between the ship and the sands, and 
even that with difiiculty enough, partly with the weight of the 
things I had about me, and partly the roughness of the water ; for 
the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high water it 
blew a storm. 

But I had got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all my 
wealth about me, very secure. It blew very hard all night, and in 
the morning, when I looked out, behold no more ship was to be 
Seen ! I was a little surprised, but recovered myself with the satis- 
factory reflection that I had lost ho time, nor abated any diligence, 
to get everything out of her that could be useful to me ; and that, 
indeed, there was little left in her that I was able to bring away, 
if I had had more time. 

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of anything 
out of her, except what might drive on shore from her wreck ; as, 
indeed, divers pieces of her afterwards did. But those things were 
of small use to me. 

CHAPTER XL 

Mv thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself 
against either savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any 



56 

were in the island. I had many thoughts of the method how to 
do this, and what kind of dwelling to make, — whether I should 
make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon the earth ; and, in 
Short, I resolved upon both, the manner and description of which 
it may not be improper to give an account of. 

I soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settlement, 
because it was upon a low, moorish ground, near the sea, and I 
believed it would not be wholesome, and more particularly because 
there was no fresh water near it.- So I resolved to find a more 
healthy and more convenient spot of ground. 

I consulted several things in my Situation which I found would 
be proper for me : health and fresh water, I just now mentioned ; 
shelter from the heat of the sun ; security from ravenous creatures, 
whether man or beast ; and a view to the sea, that if God sent any 
ship in sight, I might not lose any advantage for my deliverance, 
of which I was not willing to banish all my expectation yet. 

In search of a place proper for this, I found a little piain on the 
side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little piain was steep 
as a house side, so that nothing could come down upon me from 
the top. On the side of the rock there was a hoUow place, worn 
a little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave ; but there was 
not really any cave, or way into the rock at all. 

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I resolved 
to pitch my tent. This piain was not above a hundred yards 
broad, and about twice as long, and lay like a green before my 
door ; and, at the end of it, descended irregularly every way down 
into the low ground by the seaside. It was on the north-northwest 
side of the hill, so that it was sheltered from the heat every day, 
tili it came to a west and by south sun, or thereabouts, which, in 
those countries, is near the setting. 

Before I set up my tent I drew a half-circle before the hollow 
place, which took in about ten yards in its semidiameter, from 
the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning and 
ending. 

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving 



57 

them into the ground tili they stood very firm like piles, the big- 
gest end being out of the ground above üve feet and a half, and 
sharpened on the top. The two rows did not stand above six 
inches from one another. 

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, 
and laid them in rows, one upon another, within the circle, be- 
tween these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes 
in the inside, leaning against them, about two feet and a half high, 
like a spur to a post. This fence was so strong that neither man 
nor beast could get into it or over it. • This cost rne a great deal 
of time and labor, especially to cut the piles in the woods, bring 
them to the place, and drive them into the earth. 

The entrance into this plac^ I made to be, not by a door, but 
by a Short ladder to go over the top. This ladder, when I was in, 
I lifted over after me, and so I was completely fenced in, and 
consequently slept secure in the night, which otherwise I could 
not have done ; though, as it appeared afterwards, there was no 
need of all this caution from the enemies that I apprehended dan- 
ger from. 

Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labor, I carried all my 
riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and Stores, of which you 
have the account above. And I made a large tent, which, to pre- 
serve me from the rains that in one part of the year are very 
violent there, I made double, one smaller tent within, and one 
larger tent above it, and covered the uppermost with a large 
tarpaulin, which I had saved among the sails. 

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had 
brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very 
good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship. 

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything that 
would spoil by the wet ; and having thus inclosed all my goods, 
I made up the entrance, which tili now I had left open, and so 
passed and repassed, as I said, by a short ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, 
and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down out through 



58 

my tent, I laid them up within my fence, in the nature of a ter- 
race, so that it raised the ground within about a foot and a half; 
and thus I made me a cave, just behind my tent, which served me 
like a cellar to my house. 

It cost me much labor and many days before all these things 
were brought to perfection; and, therefore, I must go back to 
some other things which took up some of my thoughts. At the 
same time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for the setting 
up my tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain falling 
from a thick, dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning happened, 
and after that, a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the effect of 
it. I was not so much surprised with the lightning as I was with 
a thought which darted into my mind as swift as the lightning 
itself, — "O my powder !" My very heart sank within me when 
I thought that, at one blast, all my powder might be destroyed ; 
on which, not my defense only, but the providing my food, as I 
thought, entirely depended. I was nothing near so anxious about 
my own danger, though, had the powder took fire, I should never 
hRv^ known what had hurt me. 

Such impression did this make upon me that, after the storm 
was over, I laid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, 
and applied myself to make bags and boxes, to separate the 
powder, and to keep it a little and a little in a parcel, in the hope 
that whatever might come it might not all take fire at once ; and 
to keep it so apart that it should not be possible to make one 
part fire another. I finished this work in about a fortnight ; and 
I think my powder, which in all was about two hundred and forty 
pounds weight, was divided in not less than a hundred parcels. 
As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any 
danger from that ; so I placed it in my new cave, which, in my 
fancy, I called my kitchen. The rest I hid up and down in holes 
among the rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very 
carefuUy where I laid it. 

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out once at 
least every day with my gun, as well to divert myself as to see if 



59 

I could kill anything fit for food; and, as near as I could, to 
acquaint myself with what the Island produced. The first time 
I went out, I presently discovered that there were goats in 
the island, which was a great satisfaction to me ; but then it was 
attended with this misfortune to me, namely, that they were so 
shy, so stibtle, and so swift of foot that it was the most difficult 
thing in the world to come at them. But I was not discouraged 
at this, not doubting but I might now and then shoot one, as it 
soon happened ; for after I had found their haunts a little, I laid 
wait in this manner for them : I observed if they saw me in the 
Valleys, though they were upon the rocks, they would run away, 
as in a terrible fright ; but if they were feeding in the Valleys, and 
I was upon the rocks, they took no notice of me ; from whence I 
concluded that by the position of their optics theiir sight was 
so directed downward that they did not readily see objects that 
were above them. So afterwards I took this method, — I always 
climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then had fre- 
quently a fair mark. 

The first shot I made among these creatures, I killed a she- 
goat, which had a little kid by her, which she gave suck to. This 
grieved me heartily, for, when the old one feil, the kid stood stock 
still by her, tili I came and took her up. And not only so, but 
when I carried the old one with me, upon my Shoulders, the kid 
foUowed me quite to my inclosure ; upon which I laid down the 
dam, and took the kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, 
in hopes to have bred it up tame. But it would not eat ; so I 
was forced to kill it, and eat it myself. These two supplied me 
with flesh a great while, for I ate sparingly, and saved my pro- 
visions, my bread especially, as much as possibly I could. 

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely neces- 
sary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to bum. What 
I did for that, and also how I enlarged my cave, and what con- 
veniences I made, I shall give a füll account of in its place ; but I 
must now give some little account of myself, and of my thoughts , 
about living, which, it may well be supposed, were not a few.

CHAPTER XII. 

I HAD a dismal prospect of my condition ; for as I was not cast 
away upon that island without being driven, as is said, by a vio- 
lent storm, quite out of the course of our intended voyage, and 
a great way, namely, some hundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary 
course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason to consider it 
as a determination of Heaven that in this desolate place, and in 
this desolate manner, I should end my life. The tears would run 
plentifully down my face when I made these reflections ; and 
sometimes I would expostulate with myself why Providence should 
thus corapletely ruin his creatures, and render them so absolutely 
miserable, so without help, abandoned, so entirely depressed, that 
it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life. 

But something always retumed swift upon me to check these 
thoughts, and to reprove me. Particularly one day, Walking with 
my gun in my band by the seaside, I was very pensive upon the 
subject of my present condition, when reason, as it were, expostu- 
lated with me the other way, thus : " Well, you are in a desolate 
condition, it is true ; but, pray remember, where are the rest of 
yoü ? Did not you come eleven of you in the boat ? Where are 
the ten? Why were not they saved, and you lost? Why were 
you singled out? Is it better to be here or there? " And then I 
pointed to the sea. All evils are to be considered with the good 
that is in them, and with what worse attends them, 

Then it occurred tp me again how well I was fumished for my 
subsistence, and what would have been my case if it had not 
happened (which was a^hundred thousand to one) that the ship 
floated from the place where she first Struck, and was driven so 
near to the shore that I had time to get all these things out of her. 
What would have been my case if I had been forced to live in the 
condition in which I at first came on shore, without necessaries of 
life, or necessaries to supply and procure them ? " Particularly," 
Said I aloud (though to myself) , " what should I have done withr 



6t 

out a gun, without ammunition, without any tools to make any- 
thing, or to work with, without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any 
manner of covering?" Now I had all these to sufficient quantity, 
and was in a fair way to provide myself in such a manner as to live 
without my gun when my ammunition was spent. I had a toler- 
able view of subsisting, without any want, as long as I lived ; Tor I 
considered from the beginning how I would provide for the acci- 
dents that might happen, and for the time that was to come, even 
not only after my ammunition should be spent, but even after my 
health and strength should decay. 

And now being to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of 
silent life such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the world before, 
I shall take it from its beginning, and continue it in its order. It 
was, by my account, the 30th of September, when, in the manner 
as above said, I first set foot upon this horrid island ; when the 
sun, being to us in its autumnal equinox, was almost just over my 
head ; for I reckoned myself, by Observation, to be in the latitude 
of nine degrees twenty-two minutes north of the line. 

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into 
my thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of 
books and pen and mk, and should even forget the Sabbath days. 
To prevent this I cut with my knife upon a large post, in capital 
letters, and making it into a great cross, I set it up on the shore 
where I first landed : " I came on shore here on the joth of Sep- 
tember, 1659." 

Upon the sides of this Square post I cut every day a notch with 
my knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, 
and every first day of the month, as long again as that long one ; 
and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly 
reckoning of time. 

In the next place we are to observe that among the many 

. things which I brought out of the ship in the several voyages 

which, as above mentioned, I made to it, I got several things of 

less value, but not at all less useful to me, which I omitted setting 

down before ; as, in particular, pens, ink, and paper ; several 



62 

parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keep- 
ingj three or four compasses, some mathematical Instruments, 
dials, perspectives, Charts, and books of navigation, all which I 
huddled together, whether I might want them or no. Also, I 
found three very good Bibles, which came to me in my cargo from 
England, and which I had packed up among my things ; some 
Portuguese books also; and, among them, two or three prayer 
books, and several other books, all which I carefully secured. 
And I must not forget that we had in the ship a dog and two 
cats, of whose eminent history I may have occasion to say some- 
thing in its place ; for I carried both the cats with me, and as for 
the dog, he jumped out of the ship of himself, and swam on shore 
to me the day after I went on shore with my first cargo, and was a 
trusty servant to me many years. I wanted nothing that he could 
fetch me, nor any Company that he could make up to me. I only 
wanted to have him talk to me, but that would not do. As I 
observed before, I found pens, ink, and paper, and I husbanded 
them to the utmost ; and I shall show that while my ink lasted, I 
kept things very exact, but after that was gone I could not, for I 
could not make any ink by any means that I could devise. 

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwith- 
standing all that I had amassed together. Of these, ink was one ; 
as also a spade, pickax, and shovel, to dig or remove the earth ; 
needles, pins, and thread. As for linen, I soon leamed to want 
that without much difiiculty. 

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily ; and 
it was near a whole year before I had entirely finished my little 
pale, or Surround ed my habitadon. The piles or stakes, which 
were as heavy as I could well Hft, were a long tirae in cutting and 
preparing in the woods, and more, by far, in bringing home. I 
spent sometimes two days in cutting and bringing home one of 
those posts, and a third day in driving it into the ground ; for 
which purpose I got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last 
bethought myself of one of the iron crows ; which, however, 
though I found it, made driving those posts or piles very laborious 



63 



and tedious work. But what need I have been concerned at the 
tediousness of anything I had to do, seeing I had time enough to 
do it in? Nor had I any other eraployment, if that had been 
over, at least that I could foresee, except the ranging the Island 
to seek för food, which I did, more or less, every day. 

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the cir- 
cumstances I was reduced to ; and I drew up the State of my 
affairs in writing, not so much to leave them to any that were to 
corae after me, as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring over 
them, and afflicting my mind. As my reason began now to 
master my despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I 
could, and to set the good against the evil, that I might have 
something to distinguish my case from worse ; and I stated very 
impartially, like debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed 
against the miseries I suffered, thus : 

GOOD. 



EVIL. 

I am cast upon a homble, 
desolate island, void of all hope 
of recovery. 

I am singled out and sepa- 
rated, as it were, from all the 
World, to be miserable. 



I am divided from mankind — 
a solitaire; one banished from 
human society. 

I have not clothes to cover 
me. 

I am without any defense, or 
means to resist any violence of 
man or beast. 



But I am alive, and not 
drowned, as all my ship's Com- 
pany were. 

But I am singled out, too, 
from all the ship's crew, to be 
spared from death; and He 
that miraculously saved me from 
death, can deliver me from this 
condition. 

But I am not starved and 
perishing on a barren place, 
affording no sustenance. 

But I am in a hot climate, 
where, if I had clothes, I could 
hardly wear them. 

But I am cast on an island 
where I see no wild beasts to 
hurt me, as I saw on the coast 
of Africa ; and what if I had 
been shipwrecked there? 



64 

I have no soul to speak to or But God wonderfully sent 
relieve me. the ship in near enough to the 

shore that I have got out as 
many necessary things as will 
either supply my wants or en- 
able me to supply myself, even 
as long as I live. 

lipon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony that there 
was scarce any condition in the world so miserable but there was 
something to be thankful for in it ; and let this stand as a direc- 
tion, from the experience of the most miserable of all conditions 
in this World, that we may always find in it something to comfort 
ourselves from, and to set, in the description of good and evil, on 
the credit side of the account, 

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, 
and given over looking out to sea to see if I could spy a ship, — 
I say, giving over these things, I began to apply myself to arrange 
my way of living, and to make things as easy to me as I could. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

I HAVE already described my habitation, which was a tent under 
the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and 
cables. But I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind 
of wall up against it of turfs, aböut two feet thick on the outside; 
and after some time (I think it was a year and a half) I raised 
rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it 
with boughs of trees, and such things as I could get, to keep out 
the rain, which I found at some times of the year very violent. 

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this 
pale, and into the cave which I had made behind me. But I must 
observe, too, that at first this was a confused heap of goods, which, 
as they lay in no order, so they took up all my place. I had no 



65 

room to turn myself. So I set myself to enlarge my cave, and 
work farther into the earth ; for it was a loose, sandy rock, which 
yielded easily to the labor I bestowed on it. And when I found 
I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways, to the 
right hand, into the rock ; and then, turning to the right again, 
worked quite out, and made me a door to come out on the outside 
of my pale or fortification. This gave me not only egress and re- 
gress, as it was a back way to my tent and to my storehouse, but 
gave me room to störe my goods. 

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things 
as I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a table ; for 
without these I was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in 
the World. I could not write, or eat, or do several things with so 
much pleasure without a table. So I went to work. And here I 
must needs observe that as reason is the substance and origin of 
the mathematics, so by stating and squaring everything by reason, 
and by making the most rational judgment of things, every man 
may be, in time, master of every mechanic art. I had never 
handled a tool in my hfe ; and yet, in time, by labor, application, 
and contrivance, I found, at last, that I wanted nothing but I could 
have made it, especially if I had had tools. However, I made abun- 
dance of things, even without tools ; and some with no more tools 
than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made that 
way before, and that with infinite labor. For example, if I wanted 
a board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an 
edge before me, and hew it flat on either side with my ax, tili I 
had brought it to be thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with 
my adze. It is true, by this method I could make but one board 
out of a whole tree ; but this I had no remedy for but patience, 
any more than I had for the prodigious deal of time and labor 
which it took me to make a plank or board. But my time or 
labor was little worth, and so it was as well employed one way as 
another. 

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, 
in the first place ; and this I did out of the short pieces of boards 

ROB. CKU. — 5 



66 

that I brought on my raft from the ship. But when I had wrought 
out some boards as above, I niade large shelves, of the breadth of 
a foot and a half, one over another all along one side of my cave, 
to lay all my tools, nails, and ironwork on ; and, in a word, to 
separate everything at large into their places, that I might come 
easily at them. I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to 
hang my guns and all things that would hang up. Had my cave 
been to be seen, it looked like a general magazine of all necessary 
things ; and I had everything so ready at my hand that it was a 
great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such order, and espe- 
cially to find my stock of all necessaries so great. 

And now it was that I began to keep a Journal of every day's 
employment; for, indeed, at first, I was in too much hurry, and 
not only hurry as to labor, but in too much discomposure of 
mind ; and my Journal would have been füll of many dull things. 
I shall here give you the copy (though in it will be told all these 
particulars over again) as long as it lasted ; for having no more ink, 
I was forced to leave it off. 



THE JOURNAL. 

September 30, 1659. — 1> poor, miserable Robinson Crusoe, 
being shipwrecked during a dreadful storm in the offing, came 
on shore on this dismal, unfortunate island, which I called ^ The 
Island of Despair ; " all the rest of the ship's Company being 
drowned, and myself almost dead. 

All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal 
circumstances I was brought to ; namely, I had neither food, house, 
clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to ; and, in despair of any relief, 
saw nothing but death before me, — either that I should be de- 
voured by wild beasts, murdered by savages, or starved to death 
for want of food. At the approach of night I slept in a tree, for 
fear of wild creatures; but slept soundly, though it rained all 
night. 



67 

Oc tober i. — In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the 
ship had floated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again 
much nearer the Island. This, as it was some comfort, on one 
band, — for, seeing her set upright, and not broken to pieces, I 
hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on board, and get some 
food and necessaries out of her for my relief, — so, on the other 
hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my comrades, who, I 
imagined, if we had all staid on board, might have saved the 
ship, or, at least, that they would not have been all drowned, as 
they were ; and that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps 
have built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship, to have carried 
US to some other part of the world, I spent great part of this day 
in perplexing myself on these things ; but, at length, seeing the 
ship almost dry, I went upon the sand as near as I could, and then 
swam on board. This day also it continued raining, though with 
no wind at all. 

From the ist of Oc tober to the 24th. — All these days entirely 
spent in many several voyages to get all I could out of the ship, 
which I brought on shore every flood of tide upon rafts. Much 
rain also in the days, though with some intervals of fair weather ; 
but it seems this was the rainy season. 

Oct, 20. — I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon 
it ; but, being in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I 
recovered many of them when the tide was out. 

Oct, 25. — It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of 
wind ; during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind blow- 
ing a little harder than before, and was no more to be seen, except 
the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I spent this day in 
covering and securing the goods which I had saved, that the rain 
mi^ht not spoil them. 

Oct, 26. — I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out a 
place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself from 
any attack in the night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards 
night I fixed upon a proper place, under a rock, and marked out 
a semicircle for my encampment, which I resolved to strengthen 



6S 

with a work, wall, or fortification, made of double piles, lined within 
with cables, and without, with turf. 

From the 26th to the 3oth, I worked very hard in carrying all 
my goods to my new habitation, though some part of the tinie it 
rained exceedingly hard. 

The 3 ist, in the morning, I went out into the island with my 
gun, to seek for some food, and discover the country. I killed a 
she-goat, and her kid followed me horae, which I afterwards killed 
also, because it would not feed. 

November i . — I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there for 
the first night ; making it as large as I could, with stakes driven 
in to Swing my hammock upon. 

Nov, 2. — I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces 
of timber which made my rafts, and with them formed a fence 
round me, a little within the place I had marked out for my 
fortification. 

Nov, 3. — I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like 
ducks, which were very good food. In the afternoon went to 
work to make me a table. 



CHAPTER XIV. 

Nov, 4. — This morning I began to order my times of work, of 
going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion. Every 
morning I walked out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did 
not rain ; then employed myself to work tili about eleven o'clock ; 
then ate what I had to live on ; and from twelve tili two I lay down 
to sleep, the weather being excessively hot ; and then, in the even- 
ing, to work again. The working part of this day and of the next 
was whoUy employed in making my table, for I was yet but a very 
sorry workman, though time and necessity made me a complete 
natural mechanic soon after, as I believe they would do any one 
eise. 

Nov, 5. — This day, went abroad with my gun and my dog, and 



69 

killed a wild cat ; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for noth- 
ing. Every creature that I killed I took off the skins and pre- 
served them. Coming back by the seashore, I saw many sorts 
of sea fowls, which I did not understand ; but was surprised, and 
almost frightened, with two or three seals, which, while I was gaz- 
ing at, not well knowing what they were, got into the sea, and 
escaped me for that time. 

Nov, 6. — After my morning walk, I went to work with my table 
again, and finished it, though not to my liking ; nor was it long 
before I learned to mend it. 

Nov- 7. — Now it began to be settled fair weather. The yth, 
8th, 9th, loth, and part of the i2th (for the iith was Sunday), I 
took whoUy up to make me a chair, and with much ado brought it 
to a tolerable shape, but never to please me ; and even in the 
making I pulled it in pieces several times. 

Note. — I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting 
my mark for them on my post, I forgot which was which. 

Nov, 13. — This day it rained, which refreshed me exceed- 
ingly, and cooled the earth ; but it was accompanied with terrible 
thunder and lightning, which frightened me dreadfully, for fear of 
my powder. As soon as it was over, I resolved to separate my 
stock of powder into as many little parcels as possible, that it 
might not be in danger. 

Nov, 14, 15, 16. — These three days I spent in making little 
Square chests, or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two 
pounds at most, of powder; and so, putting the powder in, I 
stowed it in places as secure and remote from one another as pos- 
sible. On one of these three days I killed a large bird that was 
good to eat, but I knew not what to call it. 

Nov. 17. — This day I began to dig behind my tent into the 
rock, to make room for my further conveniency. 

Note. — Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work; 
namely, a pickax, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket; so I 
desisted from my work, and began to consider how to supply that 
want and make me some tools. As for the pickax, I made use 



70 

of the iron crows, which were proper enough, though heavy. But 
the next thing was a shovel, or spade. This was so absolutely 
necessary that, indeed, I could do nothing effectually without it ; 
but what kind of one to make I knew not. 

NoiK i8. — The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree 
of that wood, or like it, which, in Brazil, they call the iron tree, 
for its exceeding hardness. Of this, with great labor, and almost 
spoiling my ax, I cut a piece, and brought it home, too, with diffi- 
culty enough, for it was exceeding heavy. The excessive hard- 
ness of the wood, and my having no other way, made me a long 
while upon this machine, for I worked it effectually by little and 
little into the form of a shovel or spade ; the handle exactly shaped 
like ours in England, only that the board part having no iron shod 
upon it at bottom, it would not last me so long. However, it 
served well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put it to ; 
but never was a shovel, I believe, made after that fashion, or so 
long in making. 

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheelbarrow. 
A basket I could not make by any means, having no such things 
as twigs that would bend to make wicker wäre, — at least, none 
yet found out. As to a wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all 
but the wheel, but that I had no notion of, neither did I know 
how to go about it ; besides, I had no possible way to make the 
iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the wheel to run in. So I 
gave it over, and for carrying away the earth which I dug out of 
the cave I made me a thing like a hod which the laborers carry 
mortar in when they serve the bricklayers. This was not so diffi- 
cult to me as the making the shovel ; and yet this and the shovel, 
and the attempt which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took 
me no less than four days, — I mean always excepting my morning 
walk with my gun, which I seldom failed, and very seldom failed 
also bringing home something fit to eat. 

Nov, 23. — My other work having now stood still, because of my 
making these tools, when they were finished I went on, and working 
every day, as my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days 



71 

entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it might hold 
my göods comraodiously. 

Note. — During all this tirae I worked to make this room or 
cave spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse, or 
magazine, a kitchen, a dining room, and a cellar. As for my lodg- 
ing, I kept to the tent ; except that sometimes, in the wet season of 
the year, it rained so hard that I could not keep myself dry, which 
caused me afterwards to cover all my place within my pale with 
long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning against the rock, and 
load them with flags and large leaves of trees, like a thatch. 

December lo. — I began now to think my cave or vault finished, 
when on a sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great 
quantity of earth feil down from the top on one side ; so much 
that, in short, it frighted me, and not without reason, too, for if 
I had been under it, I had never wanted a gravedigger. I had 
now a great deal of work to do over again, for I had the loose 
earth to carry out ; and, which was of more importance, I had 
the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no more would 
come down. 

Dec, II. — This day I went to work with it accordingly, and 
got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two pieces 
of boards across over each post. This I finished the next day ; 
and setting more posts up with boards, in about a week more I 
had the roof secured, and the posts, Standing in rows, served me 
for partitions to part off the house. 

Dec. 17. — From this day to the 20th I placed shelves, and 
knocked up nails on the posts to hang everything up that could 
be hung up; and now I began to be in some order within 
doors. 

Dec, 20. — Now I carried everything into the cave, and began 
to fumish my house, and set up some pieces of boards like a 
dresser, to order my victuals upon ; but boards began to be very 
scarce with me. Also I made me another table. 

Dec, 24. — Much rain all night and all day. No stirring out. 

Dec, 25. — Rain all day. 



7^ 

Dec. 26. — No rain, and the earth much cooler than before 
and pleasanter. 

Dec, 27. — Killed a young goat, and lamed another so that I 
caught it and led it home in a string ; when I had it at home, I 
bound and splintered up its leg, which was broken. 

N.B. — I took such care of it that it lived, and the leg grew 
well and as strong as ever ; but, by my nursing it so long, it 
grew tarne, and fed upon the little green at my door, and would 
not go away. This was the first time that I entertained a thought 
of breeding up some tarne creatures, that I might have food when 
my powder and shot was all spent. 

Dec, 28, 29, 30, 31. — Great heats, and no breeze so that 
there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food. 
This time I spent in putting all my things in order within doors. 



CHAPTER XV. 

January 1. — Very hot still; but I went abroad early and late 
with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This even- 
ing, going farther into the Valleys which lay towards the center 
of the island, I found there were plenty of goats, exceedingly 
shy, and hard to come at. However, I resolved to try if I could 
not bring my dog to hunt them down. 

Jan, 2, — Accordingly, the next day I went out with my dog, 
and set him upon the goats ; but I was mistaken, for they all faced 
about upon the dog, and he knew his danger too well, for he would 
not come near them. 

/an. 3. — I began my fence, or wall; which, being still jealous 
of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick 
and strong. 

N.B. — This wall being described before, I purposely omit 
what was said in the Journal. It is sufficient to observe that I 
was no less time than from the 3rd of January to the i4th of 
April working, finishing, and perfecting this wall, though it was

no more than about twenty-four yards in length, being a half-circle 
from one place in the rock to another place about eight yards 
from it, the door of the cave being in the center behind it. 

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me many 
days, nay, sometimes weeks together; but I thought I should 
never be perfecdy secure tili this wall was finished. It is scarce 
credible what inexpressible labor everything was done with, espe- 
cially the bringing piles out of the woods, and driving them into 
the ground ; for I made them much bigger than I needed. 

When this wall was finished, and the outside double-fenced, 
with a turf wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that 
if any people were to come on shore there, they would not per- 
ceive anything like a habitation ; and it was very well I did so, as 
may be observed hereafter upon a very remarkable occasion. 

During this time I made my rounds in the woods for game 
every day when the rain permitted me, and made frequent dis- 
coveries in these walks of something or other to my advantage. 
Particularly, I found a kind of wild pigeons, which build, not as 
wood pigeons in a tree, but rather as house pigeons, in the holes 
of the rocks. Taking some young ones, I endeavored to breed 
them up tame, and did so ; but when they grew older they flew 
away, which perhaps was at first for want of feeding them, for I 
had nothing to give them. However, I frequently found their nests, 
and got their young ones, which were very good meat. 

And now, in the managing my household afifairs, I found myself 
wanting in many things, which I thought at first it was impossible 
for me to make ; as, indeed, with some of them it was. For 
instance, I could never make a cask to be hooped. I had a small 
cask or two, as I observed before ; but I could never arrive at the 
capacity of making one by them, though I spent many weeks 
about it. I could neither put in the heads, nor join the staves so 
true to one another as to make them hold water ; so I gave that 
also over. In the next place, I was at a great loss for candles ; 
so that as soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by seven 
o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of 



74 

beeswax with which I made candles in my African adventure ; 
but I had none of that now. The only remedy I had was, thstt 
when I had killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with a little 
dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added 
a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp. This gave me light, 
though not a clear, steady light like a candle. In the middle of 
all my labors it happened that, rummaging my things, I found 
a little bag, which, as I hinted before, had been filled with corn 
for the feeding of poultry, — not for this voyage, but before, as 
I suppose, when the ship came from Lisbon. The little remain- 
der of com that had been in the bag was all devoured by the 
rats, and I saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust ; and being 
willing to have the bag for some other use, (I think it was to put 
powder in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or some 
such use,) I shook the husks of corn out of it on one side of my 
fortification, under the rock. 

It was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that 
I threw this stuff away, taking no notice, and not so much as 
remembering that I had thrown anything there. About a month 
after, or thereabouts, I saw some few stalks of something green 
shooting out of the ground, which I fancied might be some plant 
I had not seen; but I was surprised, and perfectly astonished, 
when, after a little longer time, I saw about ten or twelve ears 
come out, which were perfect green barley, of the same kind as 
our European — nay, as our English barley. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of 
my thoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no 
religious foundation at all; indeed, I had very few notions of 
religion in my head, nor had entertained any sense of anything 
that had befallen me, otherwise than as chance, or, as we lightly 
say, what pleases God, without so much as inquiring into the end 
of Providence in these things, or his order in governing events for 
the World. But after I saw barley grow there, in a climate which 
I knew was not proper for corn, and especially that I knew not 
how it came there, it Startled me strangely, and I began to suggest 



75 

that God had miraculously caused his grain to grow without any 
help of seed sown, and that it was so directed purely for my sus- 
tenance on that wild, miserable place. 

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my 
eyes, and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature 
should happen upon my account. This was the more stränge to 
me, because I saw near it still, all along by the side of the rock, 
some other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks of rice, and 
which I knew because I had seen it grow in Africa when I was 
ashore there. 

I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence for 
my Support, but, not doubting that there was more in the place, 
I went all over that part of the island where I had been before, 
peering in every corner, and under every rock, to seek for more of 
it ; but I could not find any. At last it occurred to my thoughts 
that I shook a bag of chickens* meat out in that place. Then the 
wonder began to cease ; and, I must confess, my religious thank- 
fulness to God 's providence began to abate, too, upon the dis- 
covering that all this was nothing but what was common. Yet 
I ought to have been as thankful for so stränge and unforeseen 
a providence, as if it had been miraculous ; for it was really the 
work of Providence to me, that should order or appoint that ten 
or twelve grains of corn should remain unspoiled, when the rats 
had destroyed all the rast, as if it had been dropped from heaven ; 
as also that I should throw it out in that particular place, where, 
it being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately ; 
whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere eise, at that time, it had 
been burnt up and destroyed. 

I carefully saved the ears of this com, you may be sure, in their 
season, which was about the end of June ; and, laying up every 
corn, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping, in time, to have 
some quantity, sufficient to supply me with bread. But it was not 
tili the fourth year that I could allow myself the least grain of this 
corn to eat, and even then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards, 
in its Order. I lost all that I sowed the first season, by not 



y6 

observing the proper time; for I sowed it just before the dry 
season, so that it never came up at all, at least not as it would 
have done ; of which in its place. 

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks 
of rice, which I preserved with the same care and for the same 
use, or to the same purpose — to make me bread, or rather food ; 
for I found ways to cook it without baking, though I did that also 
after some time. 



CHAPTER XVI. 

BuT to return to my Journal : 

I worked excessively hard these three or four months, to get 
my wall done ; and the i4th of April, I closed it up, contriving to 
go into it, not by a door, but over the wall, by a ladder, that there 
might be no sign on the outside of my habitation. 

April i6. — I finished the ladder; so I went up the ladder to 
the top, and then puUed it up after me, and let it down on the in- 
side. This was a complete inclosure to me ; for within I had 
room enough, and nothing could come at me from without, unless 
it could first mount my wall. 

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost had 
all my labor overthrown at once, and myself killed. The case was 
thus : — As I was busy in the inside, behind my tent, just at the 
entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted with a most dread- 
ful surprising thing indeed ; for, all on a sudden, I found the earth 
come crumbling down from the roof of my cave, and from the edge 
of the hill over my head, and two of the posts I had set up in the 
cave cracked in a frightful manner. I was heartily scared ; but 
thought nothing of what was really the cause, only thinking that 
the top of my cave was fallen in, as some of it had done before. 
For fear I should be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and 
not thinking myself safe there either, I got over my wall for fear 
of the pieces of the hill, which I expected might roll down upon 



me. I had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground, than 
I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake. The ground I stood 
on shook three times at about eight minutes* distance, with three 
such shocks as would have overturned the strengest building that 
could be supposed to have stood on the earth ; and a great piece 
of the top of a rock which stood about half a mile from me, next 
the sea, feil down with such a terrible noise as I never heard in all 
my life. I perceived also the very sea was put into violent motion 
by it ; and I believe the shocks were stronger under the water than 
on the island. 

I was so much araazed with the thing itself, having never feit 
the like, nor discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one 
dead or stupefied. The motion of the earth made my stomach sick, 
like one that was tossed at sea \ but the noise of the falling of the 
rock awaked ,me, as it were, and rousing nie from the stupefied 
condition I was in, filled me with horror. I thought of nothing 
then but the hill falling upon my tent and all my household goods, 
and burying all at once ; and this sunk my very soul within me a 
second time. 

After the third shock was over, and I feit no more for some time, 
I began to take courage. Yet I had not heart enough to go over 
my wall again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the 
ground, greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what to 
do. All this while, I had not the least serious religious thought ; 
nothing but the common " Lord have mercy upon me ! " and when 
it was over that went away too. 

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast and grow cloudy, as if 
it would rain. Soon after that the wind arose by little and little, 
so that in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane. 
The sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth ; 
the shore was covered with the breach of the water ; the trees 
were tom up by the roots ; and a terrible storm it was. This held 
about three hours, and then began to abate ; and in two hours 
more it was quite calm, and began to rain very hard. 

All this while I sat upon the ground, very much terrified and 



78 

dejected ; when on a sudden it came into my thoughts that these 
winds and rain being the consequences of the earthquake, the 
earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might venture into my 
cave again. With this thought my spirits began to revive ; and 
the rain also helping to persuade me, I went in and sat down in 
my tent But the rain was so violent that my tent was ready to 
be beaten down with it ; and I was forced to go into my cave, 
though very much afraid and uneasy for fear it should fall on my 
head. This violent rain forced me to a new work ; namely, to cut 
a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to let the water 
go out, which would eise have flooded my cave. After I had been 
in my cave for some time, and found still no more shocks of the 
earthquake follow, I began to be more composed. 

It continued raining all that night, and great part of the next 
day, so that I could not stir abroad. But my mind being more 
composed, I began to think of what I had best do ; concluding 
that if the island was subject to these earthquakes, there would be 
no living for me in a cave, but I must consider of building a little 
hut in an open place, which I might Surround with a wall, as I had 
done here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts or men ; 
for I concluded if I staid where I was, I should certainly, one 
time or other, be buried alive. 

With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the 
place where it stopd, which was just under the hanging precipice 
of the hin ; and which, if it should be shaken again, would cer- 
tainly fall upon my tent. I spent the next two days, being the 
iQth and 20th of April, in contriving where and how to remove my 
habitation. The fear of being swallowed up alive made me that 
I never slept in quiet ; and yet the apprehension of lying abroad 
without any fence was almost equal to it. Still, when I looked 
about, and saw how everything was put in order, how pleasantly 
concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it made me very loath 
to remove. In the mean time, it occurred to me that it would re- 
quire a vast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be 
contented to venture where I was tili I had formed a camp for 



79 

myself, and had secured it so as to remove to it. So with this 
resolution I composed myself for a time, and resolved that I would 
go to work with all speed to build me a wall with piles and cables, 
etc. in a circle, as before, and set my tent up in it when it was 
finished ; but that I would venture to stay where I was tili it was 
finished, and fit to remove to. This was the 2 ist. 

April 22. — The next moming I began to consider of means to 
put this resolve into execution ; but I was at a great loss about my 
tools. I had three large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we 
carried the hatchets for traffic with the Indians) ; but with much 
chopping and cutting knotty, hard wood, they were all füll of 
notches, and dull ; and though I had a grindstone, I could not 
turn it and grind my tools too. This cost me as much though t as 
a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of politics, 
er a judge upon the Hfe and death of a man. At length, I con- 
trived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I might 
have both my hands at liberty. 

Note. — I had never seen any such thing in England, or at least 
not to take notice how it was done, though since I have observed 
it is very common there ; besides that, my grindstone was very 
large and heavy. This machine cost me a füll week's work to 
bring it to perfection. 

April 28, 29. — These two whole days I took up in grinding my 
tools, my machine for turning my grindstone performing very well.. 

April 30. — Having perceived my bread had been low a great 
while, now I took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one biscuit 
cake a day, which made my heart very heavy. ^ 

May I. — In the moming, looking towards the seaside, the tide 
being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary, 
and it looked like a cask. When I came to it, I found a small 
barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which 
were driven on shore by the late hurricane ; and looking towards 
the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the water 
than it used to do. I examined the barrel which was driven on 
shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder ; but it had 



8o 

taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as a stone. How- 
ever, I rolled it farther on shore for the present, and went on upon 
the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to look for 
more. 

When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely removed. 
The forecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at 
least six feet, and the stern, which was broken in pieces and parted 
from the rest by the force of the sea, soon after I had left rum- 
maging her, was tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one side. The 
sand was thrown so high on that side next her stern, that whereas 
there was a great place of water before, so that I could not come 
within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I could 
now walk quite up to her when the tide was out. I was surprised 
with this at first, but soon concluded it must be done by the earth- 
quake. As by this violence the ship was niore broken open than 
formerly, so many things came daily on shore, which the sea had 
loosened, and which the winds and water rolled by degrees to the 
land. 

This whoUy diverted my thoughts from the design of removing 
my habitation, and I busied myself mightily, that day especially, 
in searching whether I could make any way into the ship ; but I 
found nothing was to be expected of that kind, for all the inside 
of the ship was choked up with sand. However, as I had learned 
not to despair of anything, I resolved to pull everything to pieces 
that I could of the ship, concluding that everything I could get 
from her would be of some use or other to me. 



CHAPTER XVII. 

^^y 3- — I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam 
through, which I thought held some of the upper part, or quarter- 
deck, together, and when I had cut it through, I cleared away the 
sand as well as I could from the side which lay highest. But the 
tide Coming in, I was obliged to give over for that time. 



8i 

May 4. — I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that I durst 
eat of, tili I was weary of my sport ; when, just going to leave off, 
I caught a young dolphin. I had raade me a long line of some 
rope yarn, but I had no hooks ; yet I frequently caught fish enough, 
as much as I cared to eat ; all which I dried in the sun, and ate 
them dry. 

May 5. — Worked on the wreck; cut another beam asunder, 
and brought three great fir planks off from the decks, which I 
tied together and made to float on shore when the fiood of tide 
came on. 

May 6. — Worked on the wreck ; got several iron bolts out of 
her, and other pieces of ironwork. Worked very hard, and came 
home very much tired, and had thoughts of giving it over. 

May 7. — Went to the wreck again, not with an intent to work, 
but found the weight of the wreck had broken itself down, the 
beams being cut. Several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, 
and the inside of the hold lay so open that I could see into it ; 
but it was almost füll of water and sand. 

May 8. — Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to 
wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water or 
sand. I wrenched open two planks, and brought them on shore 
also with the tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck for next day. 

May 9. — Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way into 
the body of the wreck, and feit several casks, and loosened them 
with the crow, but could not break them up. I feit also a roll of 
English lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy to remove. 

May 10-14. — Went every day to the wreck, and got a great 
many pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and two or three 
hundredweight of iron. 

May 15. — I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a 
piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet, and 
driving it with the other ; but as it lay about a foot and a half in 
the water, I could not make any blow to drive the hatchet. 

May 16. — It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck ap- 
peared more broken by the force of the water ; but I staid so long 

RUÜ. CRU. — 6 



82 

in the woods, to get pigeons for food, that the tide prevented my 
going to the wreck that day. 

May 17. — I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at 
a great distance, near two miles off. I resolved to see what they 
were, and found it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for 
me to bring away. 

May 24. — Every day, to this day, I worked on the wreck; 
and with hard labor I loosened some things so much with the 
crow that the first blowing tide several casks floated out, and 
two of the seamen's chests. The wind blowing from the shore, 
nothing carae to land that day but pieces of tiraber, and a hogs- 
head which had some Brazil pork in it ; but the salt water and 
the sand had spoiled it. I continued this work every day to the 
i5th of June, except the time necessary to get food, which I 
always appointed, during this part of my employment, to be 
when the tide was up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed 
out. By this time I had got timber and plank and ironwork 
enough to have built a good boat, if I had known how. I also 
got, at several tiraes and in several pieces, near one hundred- 
weight of the sheet lead. 

June 16. — Going down to the seaside, I found a large tor- 
toise, or turtle. This was the first I had seen, which, it seems, 
was only my misfortune, not any defect of the place, or scarcity. 
Had I happened to be on the other side of the island, I might 
have had hundreds of them every day, as I found afterwards; 
but perhaps had paid^dear enough for them. 

June 17. — I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her three- 
score eggs ; and her flesh was to me, at that time, the most savory 
and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having had no flesh, 
but of goats and fowls, since I landed in this horrid place. 

June 18. — Rained all day, and I staid within. I thought, at 
this time, the rain feit cold, and I was something chilly, which I 
knew was not usual in that latitude. 

June 19. — Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had been 
cold. 



83 

June 20. — No rest all night; violent pains in my head, and 
feverish. 

June 21. — Very ill; frighted almost to death with the appre- 
hensions of my sad condition — to be sick, and no help. Prayed 
to God, for the first tim« since the storra off HuU, but scarce 
knew what I said, or why, my thoughts being all confused. 

June 22. — A little better; but under dreadful apprehensions 
of sickness. 

June 23. — Very bad again; cold and shivering, and then a 
violent headache. 

June 24. — Much better. 

June 25. — An ague very violent. The fit held me seven hours ; 
cold fit, and hot, with faint sweats after it. 

June 26. — Better ; and having no victuals to eat, took my gun, 
but found myself very weak. However, I killed a she-goat, and 
with much difficulty got it home, and broiled some of it, and ate. 
I would fain have stewed it, and made some broth, but had no 
pot. 

June 27. — The ague again so violent that I lay abed all day, 
and neither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for thirst ; but 
so weak I had not strength to stand up, or to get myself any 
water to drink. Prayed to God again, but was light-headed ; 
and when I was not, I was so ignorant that I knew not what to 
say ; only I lay and cried, " Lord, look upon me ! Lord, pity me ! 
Lord, have mercy upon me ! " I suppose I did nothing eise for 
two or three hours ; tili, the fit wearing off, I feil asleep, and did 
not wake tili far m the night. When I awoke I found myself 
much refreshed, but weak, and exceeding thirsty. However, as 
I had no water in my habitation, I was forced to lie tili moming, 
and went to sleep again. In this second sleep I had this terrible 
dream. 

I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside of my 
wall, where I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and 
that I saw a man descend from a great black cloud, in a bright 
flame of fire, and light upon the ground. He was all over as 



84 

bright as a flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards 
him. His countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impos- 
sible for words to describe. When he stepped upon the ground 
with his feet, I thought the earth trerabled, just as it had done 
before in the earthquake, and all the air looked, to my appre- 
hension, as if it had been filled with flashes of fire. He was no 
sooner landed upon the earth but he moved forward towards 
me, with a long spear or weapon in his band, to kill me; and 
when he came to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke 
to me — or I heard a voice so terrible that it is impossible to 
express the terror of it. All that I can say I understood was 
this : " Seeing all these things have not brought thee to repent- 
ance, now thou shalt die ; " at which words I thought he Hfted up 
the spear that was in his band to kill me. 

No one that shall ever read this account will expect that I 
should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible 
Vision. I mean, that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed 
of those horrors. Nor is it any more possible to describe the 
impression that remained upon my mind when I awaked, and 
found it was but a dream. 

I had, alas ! no knowledge of good. What I had received by 
the good instruction of my father was then worn out by an un- 
interrupted series, for eight years, of seafaring wickedness, and 
a constant conversation with none but such as were, like myself, 
wicked and profane to the last degree. I do not remember that 
I had, in all that time, one thought that so much as tended either 
to looking upwards towards God, or inwards towards a reflec- 
tion upon my own ways ; but a certain stupidity of soul, without 
desire of good, or conscience of evil, had entirely overwhelmed 
me. * I was all that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked crea- 
ture among our common sailors can be suppösed to be; not 
having the least sense, either of the fear of, or thankfulness to, 
God. But now I was brought to a just sense of the difficulties I 
had to struggle with, too great for even nature itself to support, 
and no assistance, no help, no comfort, no advice. Then I cried 



85 

out, " Lord, be my help, for I am in great distress." This was 
the first prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for many 
years. 

CHAPTER XVIII. 

June 28. — Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I 
had had, and the fit being entirely off, I got up ; and though the 
fright and terror of ray dream was very great, yet I considered 
that the fit of the ague would return again the next day, and now 
was my time to get something to refresh and support myself when 
I should be ill. The first thing I did, I fiUed a large, Square case 
bottle with water, and set it upon my table, in reach of my bed. 
Then I got me a piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the 
coals, but could eat very little. I walked about, but was very weak, 
and vvithal very sad and heavy-hearted under the sense of my 
miserable condition, dreading the retum of my distemper the next 
day. At night I made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs, 
which I roasted in the ashes, and ate, as we call it, in the shell, 
and this was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing 
to, that I could remember, in my whole life. 

After I had eaten I tried to walk, but found myself so weak 
that I could hardly carry a gun, for I never went out without that. 
So I went but a Httle way, and sat down upon the ground, looking 
out upon the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and 
smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as these occurred 
to me : What is this earth and sea, of which I have seen so much ? 
Whence is it produced ? And what am I, and all the other crea- 
tures, wild and tame, human and brutal ? Whence are we ? Sure 
we are all made by some secret power, who formed the earth and 
sea, the air and sky. And who is that? Then it followed most 
naturally, it is God that has made all. 

But why has God done this to me? What have I done to be 
thus used? My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, 
as if I had blasphemed, and methought it spoke to me like a voice : 



86 

" Wretch ! dost thou ask what thou hast done ? Look back 
upon a dreadful, misspent life, and ask thyself what thou hast not 
done. Ask why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed; 
why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads; killed in the 
fight when the ship was taken by the Sallee man-of-war ; devoured 
by the wild beasts on the coast of Africa ; or drowned here, when 
all the crew perished but thyself? Dost thou ask, What have I 
done?" I was Struck dumb with these reflections, as one aston- 
ished, and had not a word to say — no, not to answer to myself, 
but rose up pensive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and 
went up over my wall as if I had been going to bed. But my 
thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep ; 
so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began 
to be dark. 

Now, as the apprehension of the retum of my distemper terrified 
me very much, it occurred to my thought that the Brazilians take 
no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers, and I had a 
piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which was quite 
cured, and some also that was green, and not quite cured. I 
went, directed by Heaven no doubt ; for in this ehest I found a 
eure both for soul and body. I opened the ehest, and found 
what I looked for, the tobacco ; and as the few books I had saved 
lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I mentioned 
before, and which to this time I had not found leisure or inclina- 
tion to look into. I say I took it out, and brought both that and 
the tobacco with me to the table. 

What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, in my distemper, 
or whether it was good for it or no ; but I tried siveral experiments 
with it, as if I was resolved it should hit one way or other. I first 
took a piece of a leaf and chewed it in my mouth, which, indeed, 
at first almost stupefied my brain, the tobacco being green and 
strong, and that I had not been much used to. Then I took some 
and steeped it for an hour or two in some rum, and resolved to 
take a dose of it when I lay down. Lastly, I burnt some upon a 
pan of coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of it as long 



as I could bear it, as well for tbe heat as almost for sufTocatioiL 
In the interval of this Operation I took up the Bible and began 
to read ; but my head was too much disturbed with the tobacco 
to bear reading, at least at that time. Only, having opened the 
bock casually, the first words that occurred to me were these: 
" Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and 
thou shalt glorify me." 

These words were very apt to my case, and made some impres- 
sion upon my thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so 
much as they did afterwards ; for, as for being " delivered," the word 
had no sound, as I may say, to me ; the thing was so remote, so im- 
possible in my apprehension of things, that I began to say, as the 
Children of Israel did when they were promised flesh to eat, 
"Can God spread a table in the wildemess?" so I began to say, 
"Can Gfod himself deliver me from this place?" And as it was 
not for many years that any hopes appeared, this prevailed very 
often upon my thoughts. But the words made a great impression 
upon me, and I mused upon them very often. 

It now grew late, and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head 
so much that I inclined to sleep ; so I left my lamp buming in the 
cave, lest I should want anything in the night, and went to bed. 
But before I lay down, I did what I never had done in all my life, 
— I kneeled down, and prayed to God to fulfill the promise to me, 
that if I called upon him in the day of trouble, he would deliver 
me. After my broken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the 
rum in which I had steeped the tobacco, which was so strong and 
rank of the tobacco that I could scarcely get it down ; immediately 
upon this I went to bed. I found presently it flew up into my 
head violently ; but I feil into a sound sleep, and waked no more 
tili, by the sun, it must necessarily be near three o'clock in the 
afternoon the next day — nay, to this hour I am partly of opinion 
that I slept all the next day and night, and tili almost three the 
day after. Otherwise, I know not how I should lose a day out of 
my reckoning in the days of the weck, as it appeared some years 
alter I had done. If I had lost it by crossing and recrossing the 



88 

line, I should have lost more than one day. But certainly I lost a 
day in my account, and never knew which way. 

Be that, however, one way or the other, when I waked I found 
myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful. 
When I got up I was stronger than I was the day before, and my 
stomach better, for I was hungry. In short, I had no fit the next 
day, but continued much altered for the better. This was the 29th. 

The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad with 
my gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a sea fowl or 
two, something like a brand goose, and brought them home, but 
was not very forward to eat them ; so I ate some more of the 
turtle's eggs, which were very good. 'This evening I renewed the 
medicine which I had supposed did me good the day before, — 
the tobacco steeped in rum ; only I did not take so much as before, 
nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke. 
However, I was not so well the next day, which was the fi rst of 
July, as I hoped I should have been ; for I had a little spiee of the 
cold fit, but it was not much. 

July 2. — I renewed the medicine all the three ways ; and dosed 
myself with it as at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank. 

July 3. — I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not 
recover my füll strength for some weeks after. While I was thus 
gathering strength my though ts ran exceedingly upon this scripture, 
*• I will deliver thee ; " and the impossibility of my deliverance lay 
much upon my mind, in bar of my ever expecting it. But as I was 
discouraging myself with such though ts, it occurred to my mind 
that I pored so much upon my deliverance from the main afflic- 
tion that I disregarded the deliverance I had received, and I was 
as it were made to ask myself such questions as these, namely : 
" Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully too, from sickness 
— from the most distressed condition that could be, and that was 
so frightful to me ? and what notice have I taken of it ? Have I 
done my part ? God has delivered me, but I have not glorified 
him ; that is to say, I have not owned and been thankful for that 
as a deliverance; and how can I expect greater deliverance?" 



89 

This touched my heart very much ; and immediately I knelt down, 
and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery from my sickness. 

July 4. — In the moming, I took the Bible ; and, beginning at the 
New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and imposed upon 
myself to read awhile every moming and every night ; not tying 
myself to the number of chapters, but long as my thoughts should 
engage me. It was not long after I set seriously to this work, tili 
I found my heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the wick- 
edness of my past life. The Impression of my dream revived ; and 
the words, " All these things have not brought thee to repentance," 
ran seriously in my thoughts. 

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, " Call on 
me, and I will deliver thee," in a different sense from what I had 
ever done before. Then I had no notion of anything being called 
" deliverance *' but my being delivered from the captivity I was 
in ; for though I was indeed at large in the place, yet the island 
was certainly a prison to me, and that in the worst sense in the 
World. But now I learned to take it in another sense ; now I 
looked back upon my past life with such horror, and my sins 
appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God but 
deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down all my comfort. 
As for my solitary life, it was nothing. I did not so much as pray 
to be delivered from it, or think of it ; it was all of no considera- 
tion in comparison to this. And I add this part here, to hint to 
whoever shall read it that whenever they come to a true sense of 
things, they will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing 
than deliverance from affliction. 



CHAPTER XIX. 

But, leaving this part, I retum to my Journal : 

My condition now began to be, though not less miserable as to 
my way of living, yet much easier to my mind. My thoughts being 
directed, by a constant reading the scripture and praying to God, 



90 

to things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of comfort within, 
which, tili now, I knew nothing of. Also, my health and strength 
returaed, I bestirred myself to furnish myself with everything that 
I wanted, and make my way of living as regulär as I could. 

From the 4th of July to the i4th, I was chiefly employed in 
Walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a litde at a 
time, as a man that was gathering up his strength after a fit of 
sickness ; for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was and to 
what weakness I was reduced. The application which I made 
iise of was perfectly new, and perhaps had never cured an ague 
before ; neither can I recommend it to any to practice, by this ex- 
periment. Though it did carry oflf the fit, yet it rather contributed 
to weakening me ; for I had frequent convulsions in my nerves 
and limbs for some time. I learned from it also this, in particular, 
that being abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious thing 
to my health that could be, especially in those rains which came 
attended with storms and hurricanes of wind. As the rain which 
came in the dry season was almost always accompanied with such 
storms, so I found that rain was much more dangerous than the 
rain which feil in September and October. 

I had now been in this unhealthy island above ten months. All 
possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely 
taken from me ; and I firmly believe that no human shape had ever 
set foot upon that place. Having now secured my habitation, as 1 
thought, fuUy to my mind, I had a great desire to make a more 
perfect discovery of the island, and to see what other productions 
I might find, which I yet knew nothing of. 

It was on the i5th of July that I began to take a more particu- 
lar survey of the island itself. I went up the creek first, where, as 
I hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found, after I came about 
two miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it 
was no more than a little brook of running water, very fresh and 
good ; but this being the dry season, there was hardly any water 
in some parts of it, — at least, not enough to run in any stream so 
as it could be perceived. 



91 

On the banks of this brook I found many pleasant savannahs, 
or meadows, piain, smooth, and covered with grass ; and on the 
rising parts of them, next to the higher grounds, where the water, 
as might be supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of 
tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very strong stalk, 
There were divers other plants, which I had no notion of or 
understanding about, that might, perhaps, have virtues of their own, 
which I could not find out. 

I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that 
climate, make their bread of, but I could find none. . I saw large 
plants of aloes, but did not understand them. I saw several sugar 
canes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect. I con- 
tented myself with these discoveries for this time, and came back, 
musing with myself what course I might take to know the virtue 
and goodness of any of the fruits or plants which I should dis- 
cover, but could bring it to no conclusion ; for, in short, I had 
made so little Observation while I was in Brazil that I knew little 
of the plants in the field ; at least, very little that might serve to 
any purpose now in my distress. 

The next day, the i6th, I went up the same way again; and, 
after going something further than I had gone the day before, I 
found the brook and savannahs cease, and the country became 
more woody than before. In this part I found different fruits, and 
particularly I found melons upon the ground, in great abundance, 
and grapes upon the trees. The vines had spread, indeed, over 
the trees, and the Clusters of grapes were just now in their prime, 
very ripe and rieh. This was a surprising discovery, and I was 
exceeding glad of them ; but I was warned by my experience to 
eat sparingly of them ; remembering that when I was ashore in 
Barbary, the eating of grapes killed several of our Englishmen, 
who were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers. 
But I found an excellent use for these grapes ; and that was to 
eure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or 
raisins are kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they were, 
wholesome and agreeable to eat when no grapes could be had. 



92 

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habi- 
tation ; which, by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I 
had lain from home. In the night I took my first contrivance, 
and got up in a tree, where I slept well. The next morning 1 
proceeded lipon my discovery, traveling nearly four miles, as I 
might judge by the length of the valley, keeping still due north, 
with a ridge of hüls on the south and north sides of me. At the 
end of this march I carae to an opening, where the country 
seemed to descend to the west, and a little spring of fresh water, 
which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, 
— that is, due east. The country appeared so fresh, so green, so 
flourishing, everything being in a constant verdure or flourish of 
spring, that it looked like a planted garden. 

I descended a little on the side of that delicious vale, surveying 
it with a secret kind of pleasure, though mixed with my other 
afflicting thoughts, to think that this was all my own ; that I was 
king and lord of all this country indefeasibly, and had a right of 
possession.^ If I could convey it, I might have it in inheritance 
as completely as any lord of a manor in England. I saw here 
abundance of cocoa trees, orange, and lemon, and citron trees, 
but all wild, and very few bearing any fruit, at least not then. 
However, the green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant 
to eat, but very wholesome. I mixed their juice afterwards with 
water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. 
I found now I had business enough, to gather and carry home ; 
and I resolved to lay up a störe, as well of grapes as limes and 
lemons, to fumish myself for the wet season, which I knew was 
approaching. 

In Order to do this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one 
place, a lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of limes 
and lemons in another place. Taking a few of each with me, I 
traveled homewards, resolving to come again, and bring a bag or 
sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest home. Accordingly, 

1 These words call to mind Cowper's fine poem on Alexander Selkirk, which 
should here be read. See p. 245. 






93 

having spent three days in this journey, I came home (so I must 
now call my tent and my cave) ; but before I got thither the grapes 
were spoiled. The richness of the fruit and the weight of the juice 
having broken them and bruised them, they were good for little 
or nothing. As to the limes, they were good, but I could bring 
but a few. 

The next day, being the nineteenth, I went back, having made 
me two small bags to bring home my harvest. But I was surprised, 
when Coming to my heap of grapes, which were so rieh and fine 
when I gathered them, to find them all spread about, trod to pieces, 
and dragged about, some here, some there, and abundance eaten 
and devoured. By this I concluded there were some wild creatures 
thereabouts, which had done this ; but what they were I knew not. 

However, as I found there was no laying them up on heaps, and 
no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they would be 
destroyed, and the other way they would be crushed with their own 
weight, I took another course. I gathered a large quantity of the 
grapes and hung them upon the out branches of the trees, that 
they might eure and dry in the sun. Of the limes and lemons, I 
carried as many back as I could well stand under. 

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with 
great pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasant- 
ness of the Situation, the security from storms on that side the 
water, and the wood ; and I concluded that I had pitched upon 
a place to fix my abode which was by far the worst part of the 
country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of removing my 
habitation, and looking out for a place equally safe as where now 
I was situate, if possible, in that pleasant, fruitfiil part of the 
island. 

This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond 
of it for some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me. 
But when I came to a nearer view of it, I considered that I was 
now by the seaside, where it was at least possible that something 
might happen to my advantage ; and, by the same ill fate that 
brought me hither, might bring some other unhappy wretches to 



94 

the same place. Though it was scarce probable that any such 
thing should ever happen, yet to inclose myself among the hüls 
and woods in the center of the island was to anticipate my bondage, 
and to render such an affair not only improbable, but impossible. 
Therefore I ought not by any means to remove. 

However, I was so enamored of this place that I spent much 
of my time there for the whole of the remaining part of the month 
of July ; and though, upon second thoughts, I resolved not to 
remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded it 
at a distance with a strong fence, being a double hedge, as high 
as I could reach, well staked, and filled between with brushwood. 
Here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three nights together, 
always going over it with a ladder ; so that I fancied now I had 
my country house and my seacoast house. This work took me 
up to the beginning of August. 

I had but newly finished my fence, and begun to enjoy my 
labor, when the rains came on, and made me stick close to my 
first habitation ; for though I had made me a tent like the other, 
with a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the 
shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me to 
retreat into when the rains were extraordinary. . 



CHAPTER XX. 

About the beginning of August, as I said, I finished my bower, 
and began to enjoy myself. On the ^d of August, I found the 
grapes I had hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed were excel- 
lent good raisins of the sun. I began to take them down from 
the trees, and it was very happy that I did so, for the rains which 
foUowed would have spoiled them, and I had lost the best part of 
my winter food ; for I had above two hundred large bunches of 
them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and carried most 
of them home to my cave, than it began to rain ; and from hence, 
which was the i4th of August, it rained, more or less, every day 



95 

tili the middle of October; and sometimes so violendy that I 
could not stir out of my cave for several days. 

From the i4th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so that 
I could not stir, and was now very careflil not to be much wet. 
In this confinement I began to be straitened for food ; but, ven- 
turing out twice, I one day killed a goat, and the last day, which 
was the 26th, I found a very large tortoise, which was a treat to 
rae. My food was regulated thus : I ate a bunch of raisins for 
my breakfast ; a piece of the goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for my 
dinner, broiled, (for, to my great misfortune, I had no vessel to 
boil or stew anything,) and two or three of the turtle's eggs for 
my supper. 

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked 
daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees 
worked it on towards one side tili I came to the outside of the 
hill, and made a door or way out, which came beyond my fence 
or wall. So I came in and out this way. But I was not perfectly 
easy at lying so open ; for, as I had managed myself before, I was 
in a perfect inclosure ; whereas now I thought I lay exposed, and 
open for anything to come in upon me. Yet I could not perceive 
that there was any living thing to fear, the biggest creature that 
I had yet seen upon the island being a goat. 

Sept 30. — I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my 
landing. 1 cast up the notches on my post, and found I had been 
on shore three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day as a 
solemn fast, setting it apart for religious exercise, prostrating my- 
self on the ground with the most serious humiliation, confessing 
my sins to God, acknowledging his righteous judgments upon me, 
and praying to him to have mercy on me through Jesus Christ. 
Not having tasted the least refireshment for twelve hours, even tili 
the going down of the sun, I then ate a biscuit cake and a bunch 
of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as I began it. 

I had all this time observed no Sabbath day; for as at first 
I had no sense of religion upon ray mind, I had, after some time, 
omitted to distinguish the weeks by making a longer notch than 



96 

ordinary for the Sabbath day, and so did not really knöw what any 
of the days were. But now, having cast up the days as before, I 
found I had been there a year. So I divided it into weeks, and 
set apart every seventh day for a Sabbath ; though I found at the 
eiid of my account I had lost a day or two in my reckoning. 

A little after this my ink began to fall me, and so I contented 
myself to use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most 
remarkable events of my life, without continuing a daily memo- 
randum of other things. 

The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear 
regulär to me, and I leamed to divide them so as to provide for 
them accordingly. But I bought all my experience before I had 
it, and this I am going to relate was one of the most discouraging 
experiments that I made. 

I have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of barley and 
rice which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of 
themselves. I believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and 
about twenty of barley ; and now I thought it a proper time to 
sow it, after the rains, the sun being in its southem position, — 
going from me. Accordingly, I dug up a piece of ground as well 
as I could with my wooden spade, and, dividing it into two parts, 
I sowed my grain. But as I was sowing, it casually occurred to 
my thoughts that I would not sow it all at first, because I did not 
know when was the proper time for it ; so I sowed about two thirds 
of the seed, leaving about a handful of each. It was a great com- 
fort to me afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of what I 
sowed this time came to anything. The dry months foUowing, 
the earth having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no 
moisture to assist its growth, and never came up at all tili the wet 
season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been but 
newly sown. 

Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily imagined was 
by the drought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to make 
another trial in. I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower, 
and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little before the 






97 

vemal equinox. This having the rainy months of March and 
April to water it, spning up very pleasantly, and yielded a very 
good crop ; but having part of the seed left only, and not daring 
to sow all that I had, I had but a small quantity at last, my whole 
crop not amounting to above half a peck of each kind. But by 
this experiment I was made master of my business, and knew 
exactly when the proper season was to sow, and that I might 
expect two seedtimes and two harvests every year. 

While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery which was 
of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over, and the 
weather began to settle, which was about the month of November, 
I made a visit up the country to my bower, where, though I had 
not been for some months, yet I found all things just as I left 
them. The circle or double hedge that I had made was not only 
firm and entire, but the stakes which I had cut out of some trees 
that grew thereabouts were all shot out and grown with long 
branches, as much as a willow tree usually shoots the first year 
after lopping its head. 

I could not teil what tree to call it that these stakes were cut 
from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the young 
trees grow. I pruned them, and led them up to grow as much 
alike as I could ; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a figure 
they grew into in three years ; so that though the hedge made a 
circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees — for 
such I might now call them — soon covered it, and it was a complete 
shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry season. This made me 
resolve to cut some more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, 
in a semicircle round my wall (I mean that of my first dwelling), 
which I did. Placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at about 
eight yards distance from my first fence, they grew presently, and 
were at first a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards served 
for a defense also, as I shall observe in its order. 

I found now that the seasons of the year might generally be 
divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but Into the 
rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were generally thus : — 

RGB. CRU. — 7 



98 

The half of February, the whole of March, and the half of April, 
— rainy, the sun being then on or near the equator. 

The half of April, the whole of May, June, and July, and the 
half of August, — dry, the sun being then to the north of the line. 

The half of August, the whole of September, and the half of 
October, — rainy, the sun being then come back. 

The half of October, the whole of November, December, and 
January, and the half of February, — dry, the sun being then to 
the south of the line. 

The rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter as the winds 
happened to blow, but this was the general Observation I made. 
After I had found, by experience, the ill consequences of being 
abroad in the rain, I took care to fumish myself with provisions 
beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out, and I sat within 
doors as much as possible during the wet months. This time I 
found much employment, and very suitable also to the time, for I 
found great occasion for many things which I had no way to fiir- 
nish myself with but by hard labor and constant application. 
Particularly I tried many ways to make myself a basket, but all the 
twigs I could get for the purpose proved so brittle that they would 
do nothing. 

It proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was a 
boy I used to take great delight in Standing at a basket maker's, 
in the town where my father lived, to see them make their wicker 
wäre. Being, as boys usually are, very officious to help, and a 
great observer of the manner in which they worked those things, 
and sometimes lending a band, I had by these means füll knowl- 
edge of the methods of it, and I wanted nothing but the materials. 
It came into my mind that the twigs of that tree from whence 
I cut my stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the sal- 
lows, willows, and osiers in England, and I resolved to try. 

Accordingly, the next day I went to my country house, as I 
called it, and cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to 
my purpose as much as I could desire ; whereupon I came the 
next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which 



99 

I söon found, for there was great plenty of them. These I set up 
to dry within my circle, or hedge, and when they were fit for use 
I carried them to my cave. Here, during the next season, I em- 
ployed myself in making, as well as I could, a great many baskets, 
both to carry earth and to carry or lay up anything, as I had occa- 
sion. Though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made 
them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose ; and thus, afterwards, 
I took care never to be without them. As my wicker wäre de- 
cayed, I made more, especially strong, deep baskets to place my 
com in, instead of sacks, when I should come to have any quan- 
tity of it. 

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time 
about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two 
wants. I had no vessels to hold anything that was liquid, except 
two casks, which were almost füll of rum, and some glass bottles, 
— some of the common size, and others which were case bottles, 
Square, for the holding of water, spirits, etc. I had not so much 
as a pot to boil anything, except a great kettle which I saved out 
of the ship, and which was too big for such as I desired it, namely 
to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The second thing 
I fain would have had was a tobacco pipe, but it was impossible to 
me to make one ; however, I found a contrivance for that, too, at 
last. 

I employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes or 
piles, and in this wicker working, all the summer or dry season, 
when another business took me up more time than it could be 
imagined I could spare. 



CHAPTER XXI. 

I MENTiONED beforc that I had a great mind to see the whole 
island, and that I had traveled up the brook, and so on to where 
I built my bower, and where I had an opening quite to the sea, 
on the other side of the island. I now resolved to travel quite 



lOO 

across to the seashore on that side. Taking my gun, a hatchet, 
and my dog, and a larger quantity of powder and shot than usual, 
with two biscuit cakes and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch 
for my störe, I began my journey. When I had passed the vale 
where my bower stood, as above, I came within view of the sea 
to the west. It being a very clear day, I fairly descried land — 
whether an Island or a continent I could not teil ; but it lay very 
high, extending from the west to the west-southwest at a very 
great distance. By my guess it could not be less than fifteen or 
twenty leagues off. 

I could not teil what part of the world this might be, otherwise 
than that I knew it must be part of America, and, as I concluded by 
all my observations, must be near the Spanish dominions, and per- 
haps was all inhabited by savages, where, if I had landed, I had 
been in a worse condition than I was now. Therefore I acquiesced 
in the dispositions of Providence, which I began now to own and 
to believe ordered everything for the best. I say I quieted my 
mind with this, and left off afflicting myself with fruitless wishes of 
being there. 

Besides, after some thought upon this affair, I considered that if 
this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or 
other, see some vessel pass or repass one way or other; but if 
not, then it was the savage coast between the Spanish country 
and Brazil, where are found the worst of savages; for they are 
cannibäls, or men-eaters, and fail not to murder and devour all the 
human bodies that fall into their hands. 

With these considerations, I walked very leisurely forward. I 
found that side of the island where I now was much pleasanter 
than mine, — the open pr savannah fields sweet, adorned with 
flowers and grass, and füll of very fine woods. I saw abundance of 
parrots, and fain would have caught one, if possible, to have kept 
it to be tarne, and taught it to speak to me. I did, after some 
painstaking, catch a young parrot, for I knocked it down with 
a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it home. It was 
some years before I could make him speak ; however, at last, I

the country being flat and even, and they saw me much sooner 
than when I was on the hüls. 

I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than 
mine ; but yet I had not the least inclination to remove, for as I 
was fixed in my habitation it became natural to me. I seemed all 
the while I was here to be as it were upon a jouraey, and from 
home. However, I traveled along the shore of the sea towards 
the east, I suppose about twelve miles. Then, setting up a great 
pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded I would go home 
again, and that the next jouraey I took should be on the other side 
of the island, east from my dwelling, and so round tili I came to 
my post again. 

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking 
I could easily keep all the island so much in my view that I 
could not miss finding my first dwelling by viewing the country. 
But I found myself mistaken, for, being come about two or three 
miles, I found myself descended into a very large valley, but so 
surrounded with hills, and those hills so covered with wood, that 
I could not see which was my way by any direction but that of 
the sun, nor even thei), unless I knew very well the position 
of the sun at that time of the day. It happened, to my further 
misfortune, that the weather proved hazy for three or four days 
while I was in the valley, and not being able to see the sun, I 
wandered about very uncomfortably. At last I was obliged to 
find the seaside, look for my post, and come back the same 
way I went. Then, by easy jouraeys, I tumed homeward, the 
weather being exceeding hot, and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, 
and other things, very heavy. 

In this jouraey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon 
it ; and I, ranning in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it alive 
from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it home if I could, 
for I had often been musing whether it might not be possible to 
get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats, which might 
supply me when my powder and shot should all be spent. I made 
a coUar for this little creature, and with a string, which I made of 



103 

some rope yarn, which I always carried about me, I led him along, 
though with some difficulty, tili I came to iny bower. There I 
inclosed him and left him, for I was very impatient to be at home, 
from whence I had been absent above a month. 

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come in 
to my old hut, and lie down in my hammock bed. This little 
wandering journey, without settled place of abode, had been so 
unpleasant to me that my own house, as I called it to myself, 
was a perfect settlement to me compared to that; and it ren- 
dered everything about me so comfortable that I resolved I would 
never go a great way from it again, while it should be my lot to 
stay on the island. 

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after 
my long journey ; during which, most of the time was taken up in 
the weighty affair of making a cage for my Poll, who began now to 
be a mere domestic, and to be well acquainted with me. Then I 
began to think of the poor kid which I had penned in within my 
little circle, and resolved to go änd fetch it home, or give it some 
food. 

Accordingly I went, and found it where I left it, for indeed it 
could not get out, but was almost starved for want of food. I 
went and cut boughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I 
could find, and threw over to it, and having fed it, I tied it as I did 
before, to lead it away. But it was so tame with being hungry 
that I had no need to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog. 
As I continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so gentle, 
and so fond, that it became from that time one of my domestics 
also, and would never leave me afterwards. 

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and 
I kept the ßoth of September in the same solemn manner as be- 
fore, it being the anniversary of my landing on the island, having 
now been there two years, with no more prospect of being de- 
livered than the first day I came there. I spent the whole day 
in humble and thankful acknowledgments of the many wonderful 
raercies which my solitary condition was attended with, and with- 



I04 

out which it might have been infinitely more miserable. I gave 
humble and hearty thanks that God had been pleased to discover 
to me that it was possible I might be more happy in this solitary 




condition than I should have been in the liberty of society and in 
all the pleasures of the world. 

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy 
this life I now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than 
the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the past part of my 



105 

days. Now I changed both my sorrows and my joys ; my very 
desires altered, my affections changed their gusts, and my delights 
were perfectly new from what they were at my first coming, or, 
indeed, for the two years past. 

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for viewing 
the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break 
out upon me on a sudden, and my very heart would die within me, 
to think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in, and how 
I was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the 
ocean, in an uninhabited wildemess, without redemption. In the 
midst of the greatest composure of my mind, this would break out 
upon me like a storm, and make me wring my hands and weep like 
a child. Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work, 
and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the 
ground for an hour or two together ; and this was still worse to 
me, for if I could burst out into tears, or vent myself by words, it 
would go off, and the grief, having exhausted itself, would abate. 

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts. I daily 
read the word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my 
present State. One morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible 
upon these words : " I will never, never leave thee, nor forsake 
thee." Immediately it occurred that these words were to me. 
Why eise should they be directed in such a manner, just at the 
moment when I was mourning over my condition as one forsaken 
of God and man? " Well, then," said T, " if God does not forsake 
me, of what ill consequence can it be, or what matters it, though 
the World should all forsake me, seeing oh the other hand, if I 
had all the world, and should lose the favor and blessing of God, 
there would be no comparison in the loss? " 

From this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it 
was possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary 
condition, than it was probable I should ever have been in any 
other particular State in the world. Though I could not say I 
thanked God for being there, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God 
for opening my eyes to see the former condition of my life, and to 



io6 

raoum for my wickedness, and repent. I never opened the Bible, 
or shut it, but my very soul within me blessed God for directing 
my friend in England, without any order of mine, to pack it up 
among my goods, and for assisting me afterwards to save it out 
of the wreck of the ship. 



CHAPTER XXII. 

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year. 
Though I have not given the reader the trouble of so particular 
an account of my works this year as the first, yet in general it 
may be observed that I was very seldom idle, having regularly 
divided my time according to the several daiiy employments that 
were before me ; such as, first, my duty to God, and the reading 
the Scriptures, which I constantly set apart some time for, thrice 
every day; secondly, the going abroad with my gun for food, 
which generaliy took me about three hours in every morning, when 
it did not rain; thirdly, the ordering, cutting, preserving, and 
cooking what I had killed or caught for my supply. These took 
up great part of the day. Also it is to be considered that in the 
middle of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, the violence of 
the heat was too great to stir out. About four hours in the evening 
was all the time I could be supposed to work in, with this excep- 
tion, that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and working, 
and went to work in the morning, and abroad with my gun in the 
aftemoon. 

To this short time allowed for labor I desire may be added the 
exceeding laboriousness of my work ; the many hours which, for 
want of tools, want of help, and want of skill, everything I did took 
up out of my time. For example, I was füll two and forty days 
in making a board for a long shelf which I wanted in my cave ; 
whereas two sawyers, with their tools and a saw pit, would have 
cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day. 

My case was this. It was to be a large tree which was to be 



I07 

cut down, because my board was to be a broad one. This tree 
I was three days iti cutting down, and two more cutting off the 
boughs and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With inex- 
pressible hacking and hewing I reduced both the sides of it into 
Chips, tili it began to be light enough to move. Then I turaed it, 
and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board from end to 
end. Then, turning that side downward, I cut the other side tili I 
brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on 
both sides. Any one may judge the labor of my hands in such a 
piece of work ; but labor and patience carried me through that, and 
many other things. 

I only observe this in particular, to show the reason why so much 
of my time went away with so little work ; namely, that what might 
be a little to be done with help and tools, was a vast labor and 
required a prodigious time to do alone, and by hand. But not- 
withstanding this, with patience and labor I got through everything 
that my circumstances made necessary to me to do, as will appear 
by what follows. 

I was now, in the months of November and December, expect- 
ing my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had manured and 
dug up for them was not great ; for, as I observed, my seed of each 
was not above the quantity of half a peck, for I had lost one whole 
crop by sowing in the dry season. But now my crop promised 
very well, when on a sudden I found I was in danger of losing it 
all again by enemies of several sorts, which it was scarcely pos- 
sible to keep from it. First the goats, and wild creatures which 
I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay in it 
night and day, as soon as it came up, and ate it so close that it 
could get no time to shoot up into stalk. 

This I saw no remedy for but by making an inclosure about it 
with a hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil ; and the more, 
because it required speed. However, as my arable land was but 
small, suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced in about three 
weeks' time ; and shooting some of the creatures in the daytime, 
I set my dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to a stake at 



io8 

the gate, where he would stand and bark all night long. So in a 
little time the enemies forsook the place, and the com grew very 
strong and well, and began to ripen apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in the 
blade, so the birds were as likely to min me now, when it was in 
the ear ; for, going along by the place to see how it throve, I saw 
my little crop surrounded with fowls, of I know not how many 
sorts, who stood, as it were, watching tili I should be gone. I 
immediately let fly among them, for I always had my gun with me. 
I had no sooner shot, but there rose up a little cloud öf fowls, 
which I had not seen at all, from among the com itself. 

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they 
would devour all my hopes, that I should be starved, and never be 
able to raise a crop at all ; and what to do I could not teil. How- 
ever, I resolved not to lose my com, if possible, though I should 
watch it night and day. In the first place, I went among it, to see 
what damage was already done, and found they had spoiled a good 
deal of it. But as it was yet too green for them, the loss was not 
so great but that the remainder was likely to be a good crop, if it 
could be saved. 

I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could 
easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they 
only waited tili I was gone away. The event proved it to be so ; 
for as I walked off, as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of their 
sight than they dropped down one by one into the com again. I 
was so provoked that I could not have patience to stay tili more 
came on, knowing that every grain that they ate now was, as it 
might be said, a peck loaf to me in the consequence ; but coming 
up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed three of them. This 
was what I wished for. I took them up, and served them as we 
serve notorious thieves in England, — hanged them in chains, for a 
terror to others. It is impossible to imagine that this should have 
such an effect as it had, for the fowls would not only not come at 
the com, but, in short, they forsook all that part of the Island, and 
I could never see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows 



I09 

hung there. This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and about 
the latter end of December, which was our second harvest of the 
year, I reaped my com. 

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down, and 
all I could do was to make one, as well as I could, out of one of 
the broadswords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out 
of the ship. However, as my first crop was but small, I had no 
great difficulty to cut it down. In short, I reaped it in my way, for 
I cut nothing off but the ears, and carried it away in a great basket 
which I had made, and so rubbed it out with my hands. At the 
end of all my harvesting, I found that out of my half peck of seed 
I had near two busheis of rice, and about two busheis and a half of 
barley ; that is to say, by my guess, for I had no measure at that 
time. 

However, this was a great encouragement to me, and I foresaw 
that, in time, it would please God to supply me with bread. And 
yet here I was perplexed again, for I neither knew how to grind, 
or make meal of my com, or, indeed, how to clean it and part it ; 
nor, if made into meal, how to make bread of it ; and if how to 
make it, yet I knew not how to bake it. 

These things being added to my desire of having a good quantity 
for Store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved not to taste 
any of this crop, but to preserve it all for seed against the next 
season ; and, in the mean time, to employ all my study and hours 
of working to accomplish this great work of providing myself with 
com and bread. 

It might be traly said that now I worked for my bread. I be- 
lieve few people have thought much upon the stränge multitude of 
little things necessary in the providing, producing, curing, dress- 
ing, making, and finishing this one article of bread. 

I, that was reduced to a mere State of nature, found this to my 
daily discouragement ; and was made more sensible of it every 
hour, even after I got the first handful of seed com, which, as I 
have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed as a surprise. 

First, I had no plow to turn up the earth, no spade or shovel 



110 

to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making me a wooden spade, 
as I observed before. But this did my work but in a wooden 
manner ; and though it cost me a great many days to make it, 
yet for want of iron, it not only wore out soon, but made my work 
the harder, and made it be performed much worse. However, 
this I bore with, and was content to work it out with patience, 
and bear with the badness of the Performance. When the com 
was sown, I had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself, 
and drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to Scratch it, as it 
may be called, rather than rake or harrow it. 

When it was growing, and grown, I have observed already how 
many things I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or reap it, eure 
and carry it home, thrash it, part it from the chaff, and save it. 
Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt 
to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it. All these things 
I did without, as shall be observed ; and yet the com was an in- 
estimable comfort and advantage to me, too. All this, as I said, 
made everything laborious and tedious to me ; but that there was 
no help for. Neither was my time so much loss to me, because, 
as I had divided it, a certain part of it was every day appointed 
to these works. And as I had resolved to use none of the com 
for bread tili I had a greater quantity by me, I had the next six 
months to apply myself wholly, by labor and invention, to fumish 
myself with Utensils proper for the performing all the Operations 
necessary for making the com, when I had it, fit for my use. 

But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed enough 
to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had a week's 
work, at least, to make me a spade, which, when it was done, was 
but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and required double labor 
to work with it. However, I got through that, and sowed my seed 
in two large, flat pieces of ground, as near my house as I could 
find them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good hedge, the 
stakes of which were all cut off that wood which I had set before, 
and knew it would grow ; so that, in a year's time, I knew I should 
have a quick or living hedge, that would want but little repair. 



III 

This work did not take me less than three months, because a great 
part of that time was the wet season, when I could not go abroad. 

Within doors, that is when it rained, and I could not go out, 
I found employment in the following occupations, always observ- 
ing that all the while I was at work, I diverted myself with talking 
to my parrot, and teaching him to speak. I quickly taught him 
to know his own name, and at last to speak it out pretty loud, — 
" PoU," which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the island 
by any mouth but my own. This, therefore, was not my work, 
but an assistance to my work ; for now, as I said, I had a great 
employment upon my hands, as foUows : I had long studied to 
make, by some means or other, some earthen vessels, which, 
indeed, I wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at them. 
However, considering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt 
but if I could find out any clay, I might make some pots that 
might, being dried in the sun, be hard enough and strong enough 
to bear handling, and to hold anything that was dry and required 
to be kept so. As this was necessary in the preparing com, meal, 
etc., which was the thing I was doing, I resolved to make some as 
large as I could, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold what should 
be put into them. 

CHAPTER XXIII. 

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to 
teil how many awkward ways I took to raise this paste; what 
odd, misshapen, ugly things I made ; how many of them feil in, 
and how many feil out, the clay not being stiff enough to bear 
its own weight; how many cracked by the over-violent heat of 
the sun, being set out too hastily ; and how many feil in pieces 
with only removing, as well before as after they were dried ; and, 
in a word, how often, having labored hard to find the clay, to dig 
it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work it, I could not make 
above two large, earthen, ugly things (I cannot call them jars) in 
about two months* labor. 



112 

However, as thc sun baked these two very dry and hard, I lifted 
diem very gently np, and set them down again in two great wicker 
baskets, which I had made on puq>ose for them, that they might 
not break. As between the pot and the basket there was a little 
room to spare, I stuffed it fiill of the rice and barley straw. These 
two pots, being to stand always dry, I thought would hold my dry 
com, and perhaps the meal, when the com was bruised. 

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet 
I made several smaller things with better success ; such as little 
round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any things my 
band tumed to ; and the heat of the summer baked them quite 
hard. 

But all this would not answer my end, which was to get an earth- 
en pot to hold what was Uquid, and bear the fire, — which none of 
these could do. It happened after some time, making a pretty 
large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put it out after 
I had done with it, I found a broken piece of one of my earthen- 
ware vessek in the fire, bumt as hard as a stone, and red as a tile. 
I was agreeably surprised to see it, and said to myself that certainly 
they might be made to bum whole, if they would bum broken. 

This set me to study how to order my fire so as to make it 
bum some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters 
bum in, or of glazing them with lead, though I had some lead 
to do it with ; but I placed three large pipkins, and two or three 
pots, in a pile, one upon another, and placed my firewood all 
round it with a great heap of embers under them. I plied the 
fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and upon the top, tili I 
saw the pots in the inside red hot quite through, and observed 
that they did not crack at all. When I saw them clear red, I 
let them stand in that heat about five or six hours, tili I found 
one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run ; for the 
sand which was mixed with the clay melted by the violence of 
the heat, and would have run into glass if I had gone on. So I 
slacked my fire gradually tili the pots began to abate of the red 
color; and, watching them all night, that I might not let the 



113 

fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three very good (I will 
not say handsome) pipkins, and two other earthen pots, as hard 
burnt as could be desired, and one of them perfectly glazed with 
the running of the sand. 

After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of 
earthenware for my use ; but I must needs say as to the shapes of 
them, they were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, when 
I had no way of making them but as the children make dirt pies, 
er as a woman would make pies that never learned to raise paste. 

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine 
when I found I had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire. 
I had hardiy patience to stay tili they were cold before I set one 
on the fire again, with some water in it, to boil me some meat, 
which it did admirably well. With a piece of a kid I made some 
very good broth, though I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingre- 
dients requisite to make it as good as I would have had it. 

My next concem was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or 
beat some com in ; for as to the mill, there was no thought of 
arriving at that perfection of art with one pair of hands. To 
supply this want I was at a great loss ; for of all the trades in the 
world, I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone cutter as for any 
whatever. Neither had I any tools to go about it with. I spent 
many a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut hoUow, 
and make fit for a mortar, and could find none at all, except what 
was in the solid rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut out. 
Nor indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient, 
but were all of a sandy, crumbling stone, which neither would 
bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the com 
without filling it with sand. So, after a great deal of time lost in 
searching for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out for 
a great block of hard wood, which I found indeed much easier. 
Getting one as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and 
formed it on the outside with my ax and hatchet, and then, with 
the help of fire, and infinite labor, made a hoUow place in it, 
as the Indians in Brazil make their canoes. After this, I made a

great heavy pestle, or beater, of the wood called the iron wood. 
This I prepared and laid by against I had my next crop of com, 
which I proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound, into meal, 
to make bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a sieve, to dress my meal and 
to part it from the bran and the husk ; without which I did not 
see it possible I could have any bread. This was a most difficult 
thing even to think on, for to be sure I had nothing like the neces- 
sary thing to make it, — I mean fine, thin canvas or stuff to sift the 
meal through. 

And here I was at a füll stop for many months ; nor did I really 
know what to do. Linen I had none left but what was mere rags. 
I had goat's hair, but neither knew how to weave it or spin it ; 
and had I known how, here were no tools to work it with. All 
the remedy that I found for this was that at last I did remember 
I had, among the seamen's clothes which were saved out of the 
ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin. With some pieces of 
these I made three small sieves proper enough for the work ; and 
thus I made shift for some years. How I did afterwards, I shall 
show in its place. 

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how 
I should make bread when I came to have com ; for, first, I had 
no yeast. As to that part, there was no suppl)dng the want, so I 
did not concern myself much about it. But for an oven, I was 
indeed in great pain. At length I found out an experiment for 
that also, which was this : I made some earthen vessels, very broad, 
but not deep, — that is to say, about two feet diameter, and not 
above nine inches deep. These I burned in the fire, as I had done 
the others, and laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I 
made a great fire upon my hearth, which I had paved with some 
Square tiles, of my own baking and buming also ; but I should not 
call them Square. 

When the firewood was burnt pretty much into embers, or live 
coals, I drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover it all 
over, and there I let them lie tili the hearth was very hot. Then, 



IT5 

sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf or loaves, and 
turning down the earthen pot to cover them, drew the embers all 
round the outside of the pot, to keep in and add to the heat. 
Thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my barley 
loaves, and became, in a little time, a good pastry cook into the 
bargain ; for I made myself several cakes and puddings of the 
rice. But I made no pies, neither had I anything to put into 
them, supposing I had, except the flesh either of fowls or goats. 

It need not be wondered at if all these things took me up most 
part of the third year of my abode here ; for it is to be observed 
that in the intervals of these things I had my new harvest and hus- 
bandry to manage. I reaped my corn in its season, and carried 
it home as well as I could, and laid it up, in the ear, in my large 
baskets, tili I had time to rub it out, for I had no fioor to thrash 
it on, or instrument to thrash it with. 

And now, indeed, my stock of com increasing, I really wanted 
to build my barns bigger. I wanted a place to lay it up in, for 
the increase of the com now yielded me so much that I had of 
the barley about twenty busheis, and of the rice as much, or more. 
I now resolved to begin to use it freely ; for my bread had been 
quite gone a great while. Also I resolved to see what quantity 
would be sufficient for me a whole year, and to sow but once a 
year. 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty busheis of barley and 
rice were much more than I could consume in a year ; so I re- 
solved to sow just the same quantity every year that I sowed the 
last, in hopes that such a quantity would fully provide me with 
bread. 

CHAPTER XXIV. 

All the while these things were doing, you may be sure my 
thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land which I had 
Seen from the other side of the island. I was not without secret 
wishes that I were on shore there, fancying that, seeing the main- 



ii6 

land and an inhabited country, I might find some way or other 
to convey myself farther, and perhaps at last find some means of 
escape. 

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such 
an undertaking, and how I might fall into the hands of savages, 
and perhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse than 
the lions and tigers of Africa ; that if I once came in their power, 
I should run a hazard of more than a thousand to one of being 
killed, and perhaps of being eaten, for I had heard that the people 
of the Caribbean coast were cannibals, or man-eaters, and I knew 
by the latitude that I could not be far from that shore. Then, sup- 
posing they were not cannibals, yet they might kill me, as many 
Europeans who had fallen into their hands had been served, even 
when they had been ten or twenty together ; much more I, that 
was but one, and could make little or no defense. All these things, 
I say, which I ought to have considered well, and which did come 
into my thoughts afterwards, yet gave me no apprehensions at first, 
and my head ran mightily upon the thought of getting over to the 
shore. 

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the longboat with shoulder- 
of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles on the 
coast of Africa ; but this was in vain. Then I thought I would 
go and look at our ship's boat, which, as I have said, was blown 
up upon the shore a great way in the storm, when we were first 
cast away. She lay almost where she did at first, but not quite, 
and was turned, by the force of the waves and the winds, almost 
bottom upward against a high ridge of beachy, rough sand, but no 
water about her. If I had had hands to refit her, and to launch her 
into the water, the boat would have done well enough, and I might 
have gone back to Brazil with her easily enough ; but I might have 
foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her upright upon 
her bottom, than I could remove the island. However, I went to 
the woods, and cut levers and rollers, and brought them to the 
boat, resolving to try what I could do ; suggesting to rayseif that 
if I could but turn her down, I might repair the damage she had 



117 

received, and she would be a very good boat, and I might go to 
sea in her very easily. 

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and 
spent, I think, three or four weeks about it. At last, finding it 
impossible to heave it up with my little strength, I feil to digging 
away the sand, to undermine it, and so to make it fall down, set- 
ting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall. 

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to 
get under it, much less to move it forward towards the water ; so I 
was forced to give it over. Yet, though I gave over the hopes of 
the boat, my desire to venture over for the main increased, rather 
than decreased, as the means for it seemed impossible. 

This at length put me upon thinking whether it was not possible 
to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those 
climates make, even without tools, — or, as I might say, without 
hands, — of the trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought pos- 
sible but easy, and pleased myself extremely with the thoughts of 
making it, and with my having much more convenience for it than 
any of the negroes or Indians ; but not at all considering the par- 
ticular inconveniences which I lay under more than the Indians did ; 
namely, the want of hands to move it, when it was made, into the 
water, — a difficulty much harder for me to surmount than all the 
consequences of want of tools could be to them ; for what was it 
to me if, when I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, and with 
much trouble cut it down, if I had been able with my tools to hew 
and dub the outside into the proper shape of a boat, and burn or 
cut out the inside to make it hoUow, so as to make a boat of it, — 
if, after all this, I must leave it just there where I found it, and not 
be able to launch it into the water? 

One would think I could not have had the least reflection upon 
my mind of my circumstances, while I was making this boat, but 
I should have immediately thought how I should get it into the 
sea ; but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over the sea 
in it that I never once considered how I should get it off the 
land ; and it was really, in its own nature, more easy for me to 



ii8 

guide it over forty-five miles in sea, than about forty-five fathoms 
of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water. 

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever 
man did who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with 
the design, without determining whether I was ever able to under- 
take it. Not but that the difficulty of launching my boat carae 
often into my head ; but I put a stop to my inquiries into it by 
this foolish answer, which I gave myself: ** Let me first make it ; 
I Warrant I will find some way or other to get it along when it is 
done." 

This was a most preposterous method ; but the eagemess of my 
fancy prevailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar tree, and I 
question much whether Solomon ever had such a one for the build- 
ing of the Temple of Jerusalem. It was five feet ten inches diam- 
eter at the lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven inches 
diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it lessened for 
a while, and then parted into branches. It was not without infi- 
nite labor that I felled this tree. I was twenty days hacking and 
hewing at it at the bottom. I was fourteen more getting the 
branches and limbs and the vast, spreading head cut off, which I 
hacked and hewed through with ax and hatchet and inexpres- 
sible labor. After this, it cost nie a month to shape it and dub it 
to a Proportion, and to something like the bottom of a boat, that 
it might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me near three 
months more to clear the inside, and work it out so as to make an 
exact boat of it. This I did, indeed, without fire, by mere itiallet 
and chisel, and by the dint of hard labor, tili I had brought it to 
be a very handsome periagua, and big enough to have carried six- 
and-twenty men, and consequently big enough to have carried me 
and all my cargo. 

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted 
with it. The boat was really much bigger than ever I saw a canoe 
or periagua, that was made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary 
stroke it had cost, you may be sure ; and had I gotten it into the 
water, I make no question but I should have begun the maddest 



119 

voyage, and the most unlikely to be performed, that ever was 
undertaken. 

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me ; though 
they CQst me infinite labor too. It lay about one hundred yards 
from the water, and not more ; but the first inconvenience was, 
it was up hin towards the creek. Well, to take away this discour- 
agement, I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth, and so 
make a declivity. This I began, and it cost me a prodigious deal 
of pains ; but when this was worked through, and this difficulty 
managed, it was still much the same, for I could no more stir the 
canoe than I could the other boat. 

Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut 
a dock or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I could 
not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I began this work ; 
and when I began to enter upon it, and calculate how deep it was 
to be dug, how broad, and how the stuff was to be thrown out, I 
found that, by the number of hands I had, being none but my own, 
it must have been ten or twelve years before I could have gone 
through with it ; for the shore lay so high that at the Upper end 
it must have been at least twenty feet deep. So at length, though 
with great reluctancy, I gave this attempt over also. 

This grieved me heartily. Now I saw, though too late, the folly 
of beginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge 
rightly of our own strength to go through with it. 

In the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this 
place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and with 
as much comfort, as ever before. By a constant study and serious 
application to the word of God, and by the assistance of his grace, 
I gained a different knowledge from what I had before. I enter- 
tained different notions of things. I looked now upon the world 
as a thing remote, which I had nothing to do with, no expectation 
from, and, indeed, no desires about. In a word, I had nothing 
indeed to do with it, nor was ever likely to have. So I thought 
it looked as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter ; namely, as a 
place I had lived in, but was come out of it ; and well might I say. 



I20 

as Father Abraham to Dives, "Between me and thee is a great 
gulffixed." 

In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of 
the World here. I had neither the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of 
the eye, nor the pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had 
all that I was now capable of enjoying. I was lord of the whole 
manor ; or, if I pleased, I might call myself king or emperor over 
the whole country which I had possession of. There were no 
rivals. I had no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or com- 
mand with me. I might have raised shiploadings of corn, but I 
had no use for it ; so I let as little grow as I thought enough for 
my occasion. I had tortoise or turtle enough, but now and then 
one was as much as I could put to any use. I had timber enough 
to have built a fleet of ships ; and I had grapes enough to have 
made wine, or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet 
when it had been built. 

But all I could make use of was all that was valuable. I had 
enough to eat and supply my wants, and what was all the rest to 
me ? If I killed more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, 
or vermin. If I sowed more com than I could eat, it must be 
spoued. The trees that I cut down were lying to rot on the 
ground ; I could make no more use of them but for fiiel, and that I 
had no occasion for but to dress my food. 

In a Word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me, 
upon just reflection, that all the good things of this world are no 
farther good to us than they are for our use. Whatever we may 
heap up to give others, we enjoy just as much as we can use, and 
no more. The most covetous, griping miser in the world would 
have been cured of the vice of covetousness if he had been in 
my case ; for I possessed infinitely more than I knew what to do 
with. I had no room for desire, except it was of things which 
I had not, and they were but trifles, though, indeed, of great use 
to me. 

I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold as 
silver, about thirty-six pounds Sterling. Alas ! there the sorry, 



121 

useless stuff lay. I had no manner of business. for it, and often 
thought with myself that I would have given a handful of it for 
a gross of tobacco pipes, or for a band mill to grind my com. 
Nay, I would have given it all for a sixpenny worth of turnip and 
carrot seed out of England, or for a handful of peas and beans, 
and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the least advantage by 
it or benefit from it. There it lay in a drawer, and grew moldy 
with the damp of the cave in the wet seasons ; and if I had had 
the drawer full of diamonds, it had been the same case ; they had 
been of no manner of value to me, because of no use. 

I had now brought my State of life to be much easier in itself 
than it was at first, and much easier to my mind as well as to my 
body. I frequently sat down to meat with thankfulness, and ad- 
mired the band of God*s providence, which had thus spread my 
table in the wilderness. I leamed to look more upon the bright 
side of my condition, and less upon the dark side, and to consider 
what I enjoyed rather than what I wanted. This gave me some- 
times such secret comforts that I cannot express them ; and this 
I take notice of here, to put those discontented people in mind of 
it who cannot enjoy comfortably what God has given them, be- 
cause they see and covet something that he has not given them. 
All our discontents about what we want appeared to me to spring 
from the want of thankfulness for what we have. 



CHAPTER XXV. 

I HAD now been here so long that many things which I had 
brought on shore for my help were either quite gone, or very 
much wasted and near spent. My ink, as I observed, had been 
gone some time, all but a very little, which I eked out with water, 
a little and a little, tili it was so pale it scarce left any appearance 
of black upon the paper. As long as it lasted I made use of it 
to minute down the days of the month on which any remarkable 
thing happened to me. By casting up times past, I remembered 



122 

that there was a stränge concurrence of days in the various provi- 
dences which befeil me, and which, if 1 had been superstitiously 
inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had 
reason to have looked upon with a great deal of curiosity. 

First, I had observed that the same day that I broke away from 
my father and friends, and ran away to Hüll, in order to go to sea, 
the same day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and 
made a slave. The same day of the year that I escaped out of the 
wreck of that ship in Yarmouth Roads, that same day of the year 
afterwards I made my escape from Sallee in a boat. The same day 
of the year I was bom on, namely, the 30th of September, that 
same day I had my life so miraculously saved twenty-six years 
after, when I was cast on shore on this island ; so that my wicked 
life and my solitary life began both on a day. 

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my bread, I 
mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship. This I had hus- 
banded to the last degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a 
day for above a year ; and yet I was quite without bread for near 
a year before I got any com of my own. Great reason I had to 
be thankful that I had any at all, the getting it being, as has been 
already observed, next to miraculous. 

My clothes, too, began to decay. Asto linen, I had had none 
a good while, except some checkered Shirts which I found in the 
chests of the other seamen, and which I carefully preserved. 
Many times I could bear no other clothes on but a shirt ; and it 
was a very great help to me that I had, among all the men's clothes 
of the ship, almost three dozen of Shirts. There were also, indeed, 
several thick watch coats of the seamen's which were left, but 
they were too hot to wear ; and though it is true that the weather 
was so violently hot that there was no need of clothes, yet I could 
not go quite without them. 

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures that 
I killed, — I mean four-footed ones, — and I had them hung up, 
stretched out with sticks in the sun, by which means some of them 
were so dry and hard that they were fit for little ; but others were 



123 

very useftil. The first thing I made of these was a great cap 
for my head, with the hair on the outside to shoot off the rain. 
This I performed so well that afterwards I made me a suit of 
clothes whoUy of these skins, — that is to say, a waistcoat, and 
breeches open at the knees, and both loose, for they were rather 
wanting to keep me cool than to keep me warm. I must not 
omit to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made; for if I was 
a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor. However, they were such 
as I made very good shift with, and when I was out, if it hap- 
pened to rain, the hair of my waistcoat and cap being outermost, 
I was kept very dry. 

After this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to make an um- 
brella. I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great mind 
to make one. I had seen them made in Brazil, where they are 
very useful in the great heats which are there, and I feit the heats 
every jot as great here, and greater too, being nearer the equator. 
Besides, as I was obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful 
thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I took a world of 
pains with it, and was a great while before I could make anything 
likely to hold. Nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled 
two or three before I made one to my mind ; but at last I made 
one that answered indifferently well. The main difficulty I found 
was to make it let down. I could make it spread, but if it did not 
let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for me any way but 
just over my head, which would not do. However, at last, as I 
said, I made one to answer, and covered it with skins, the hair up- 
wards, so that it cast off the rain like a shed, and kept off the sun 
so effectually that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather with 
greater advantage than I could before in the coolest, and, when I 
had no need of it, could close it and carry it under my arm. 

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely com- 
posed by resigning myself to the will of God and throwing myself 
whoUy upon the disposal of his providence. This made my life 
better than sociable, for when I began to regret the want of con- 
versation, I would ask myself whether thus conversing mutually with 



124 

my own thoughts, and (as I hope I may say) with even God him- 
self, by ejaculations, was not better than the utmost enjoyment of 
human society in the world. 

I cannot say that after this, for five years, any extraordinary thing 
happened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in the same 
posture and place as before. The chief things I was employed in, 
besides my yearly labor of planting my barley and rice, and curing 
my raisins, of both which I always kept up just enough to have 
sufficient stock of one year's provision beforehand, — I say, besides 
this yearly labor, and my daily pursuit of going out with my gun, 
I had one labor, to make a canoe, which at last I finished. By 
digging a canal to it six feet wide and four feet deep, I brought it 
into the creek, almost half a mile. And though I was near two 
years about it, yet I never grudged my labor, in hopes of having a 
boat to go off to sea at last. 

Though my little periagua was finished, yet the size of it was not 
at all answerable to the design which I had in view when I made 
the first ; I mean of venturing over to the terra firma^ where the 
sea was above forty miles broad. Accordingly, the smallness of 
my boat assisted to put an end to that design, and now I thought 
no more of it. 

As I had a boat, my next design was to make a cruise round the 
island. I had been on the other side in one place, crossing, as I 
have already described it, over the land, and the discoveries I made 
in that little journey made me very eager to see other parts of the 
coast. Now I had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round 
the island. 

For this purpose, and that I might do everything with discretion 
and consideration, I fitted up a little mast in my boat, and made a 
sail to it out of some of the pieces of the ship*s sails which lay in 
Store, and of which I had a great stock by me. Having fitted my 
mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found she would sail very well. 
Then I made little lockers, or boxes, at each end of my boat, to 
put provisions, necessaries, ammunition, etc., into, to be kept dry 
either from rain or the spray of the sea. A little, long, hoUow 



125 

place I cut in the inside of the boat, where I could lay my gun, 
making a Aap to hang down over it to keep it dry. 

I fixed my umbrella, also, in a step at the stern, like a mast, to 
stand over my head and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an 
awning. Thus I every now and then took a little voyage upon 
the sea ; but never wen^ far out, nor far from the little creek. At 
last, being eager to view the circumference of my little kingdom, 
I resolved upon my cruise ; and accordingly I victualed my ship 
for the voyage, putting in two dozen of loaves (cakes I should 
rather call them) of barley bread, an earthen pot füll of parched 
rice (a food I ate a great deal of), a little bottle of ram, half a 
goat, and powder and shot for killing more, and two large watch 
coats, of those which, as I mentioned before, I had saved out of 
the seamen's chests. These I took, one to lie upon and the other 
to Cover me in the night. 

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign, — or 
my captivity, which you please, — that I set out on this voyage. I 
found it much longer than I expected, for though the island itself 
was not very large, yet when I came to the east side of it, I found 
a great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea, some 
above water, some under it, and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying 
dry half a league more ; so that I was obliged to go a great way 
out to sea to double the point. 

When first I discovered these difficulties, I was going to give 
over my enterprise, and come back again, not knowing how far it 
might oblige me to go out to sea ; and, above all, doubting how I 
should get back again. I came to an anchor ; for I had made a 
kind of an anchor with a piece of a broken grappling iron which 
I got out of the ship. 

Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore, 
climbing up a hill which seemed to overlook that point, where I 
saw the füll extent of it, and resolved to venture. 

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I perceived 
a strong and, indeed, a most furious current, which ran to the east, 
and even came close to the point. I took the more notice of it 



126 

because I saw there might be some danger that, when I came into 
it, I might be carried out to sea by the strength of it, and not be 
able to make the island again. Indeed, had I not got first upon 
this hill, I believe it would have been so ; for there was the same 
current on the other side the Island, only that it set off at a farther 
distance, and I saw there was a strong eddy under the shore ; so I 
had nothing to do but to get out of the first current, and I should 
presently be in an eddy. 

I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing pretty 
fresh at east-southeast, and that being just contrary to the current, 
made a great breach of the sea upon the point ; so that it was not 
safe for me to keep too close to the shore for the breach, nor to go 
too far off because of the stream. 

The third day, in the moming, the wind having abated over night, 
the sea was calm, and I ventured. But I am a waming again to 
all rash and ignorant pilots ; for no sootier was I come to the point, 
when I was not even my boat's length from the shore, but I found 
myself in a great depth of water, and a current like the sluice of a 
mill. It carried my boat along with it with such violence that all 
I could do could not keep her so much as on the edge of it ; but 
I found it hurried me farther and farther out from the eddy, which 
was on my left band. There was no wind stirring to help me, and 
all I could do with my paddles signified nothing. Now I began to 
give myself over for lost ; for as the current was on both sides of 
the island, I knew in a few leagues' distance they must join again, 
and then I was irrecoverably gone. Nor did I see any possibility 
of avoiding it ; so that I had no prospect before me but of perish- 
ing, not by the sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving from 
hunger. I had, indeed, found a tortoise on the shore, as big al- 
most as I could lift, and had tossed it into the boat ; and I had a 
great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my earthen pots ; but 
what was all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be 
sure, there was no shore, no mainland or island, for a thousand 
leagues at least? 

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to 



127 

inake even the most miserable condition of mankind worse. Now 
I looked back upon my desolate, solitary Island as the most pleas- 
aht place in the world, and all the happiness my heart could wish 
for was to be but there again. I stretched out my hands to it, 
with eager wishes. ** O happy desert ! " said I, " I shall never see 
thee more. O miserable creature ! whither am I going?" Then 
I reproached myself with my unthankful temper, and that I had 
repined at my solitary condition ; and now what would I give to 
be on shore there again ! Thus we never see the true State of our 
condition tili it is illustrated to us by its contraries, nor know how 
to value what we enjoy but by the want of it. 



CHAPTER XXVI. 

It is scarcely possible to imagine the constemation I was now 
in, being driven from my beloved island (for so it appeared to 
me now to be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues, and in the 
utmost despair of ever recovering it again. However, I worked 
hard, tili indeed my strength was almost exhausted, and kept my 
boat as much to the northward — that is towards the side of the 
current which the eddy lay on — as possibly I could ; when about 
noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I thought I feit a little breeze 
of wind in my face, springing up from south-soütheast. This 
cheered my heart a little, and especially when, in about half an 
hour more, it blew a pretty gentle gale. By this time I had got 
at a frightful distance from the island, and had the least cloudy 
or hazy weather intervened, I had been undone another way, too ; 
for I had no compass on board, and should never have known 
how to steer towards the island if I had but once lost sight of 
it. But the weather continuing clear, I applied myself to get up 
my mast again, and spread my sail, Standing away to the north as 
much as possible, to get out of the current. 

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to 
Stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of the water some altera- 



128 

tion of the current was near ; for where the current was so strong 
the water was foul. But perceiving the water clear, I found the 
current abate ; and presently I found to the east, at about half 
a raile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks. These rocks I 
found caused the current to part again, and as the main stress of 
it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the northeast, so 
the other returned by the repulse of the rocks, and made a strong 
eddy, which ran back again to the northwest, with a very sharp 
stream. 

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them 
upon the ladder, or to be rescued froni thieves just going to mur- 
der them, or who have been in such extremities, may guess what 
my present surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put my boat into 
the stream of this eddy; the wind also freshening, how gladly I 
spread my sail to it, running cheerfuUy before the wind, and witK 
a strong tide or eddy under foot. 

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back again, 
directly towards the island, but about two leagues more to the 
north ward than the current which carried me away at first ; so 
that when I came near the island, I found myself open to the 
northern shore of it, — that is to say, the other end of the island, 
opposite to that which I went out frora. 

When I had made something more than a league of way by the 
help of this current or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me 
no farther. However, I found that being between two great cur- 
rents, — namely, that on the south side, which had hurried me away, 
and that on the north, which lay about a league on the other side, — 
I say, between these two, in the wake of the island, I found the 
water at least still, and running no way ; and having still a breeze 
of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the island, 
though not making such fresh way as I did before. 

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within a league of 
the island, I stretched across another eddy, slanting northwest ; and 
in about an hour came within about a mile of the shore, where, it 
being sraooth water, I soon got to land. 



129 

When I was on shore, I feil on my knees and gave God thanks 
for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my de- 
liverance by my boat ; and refreshing myself with such things as 
I had, I brought my boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I 
had spied under some trees, and laid me down to sleep, being 
quite spent with the labor and fatigue of the voyage. 

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat. 
I had ran so much hazard, and knew too much of the case to 
think of attempting it by the way I went out. What might be at 
the other side (I mean the west side) I knew not, nor had I any 
mind to ran any more ventures. So I only resolved on the next 
moming to make my way westward along the shore, and to see if 
there was no creek where I might lay up my frigate in safety, so 
as to have her again if I wanted her. In about three miles, or 
thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet or 
bay, about a mile over, which narrowed tili it came to a very little 
rivulet or brook, where I found a very convenient harbor for my 
boat, and where she lay as if she had been in a little dock made 
on' purpose for her. Here I put in, and having stowed my boat 
very safe, I went on shore to look about me, and see where I was. 

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had 
been before, when I traveled on foot to that shore. So, taking 
nothing out of my boat but my gun and umbrella, for it was 
exceedingly hot, I began my march. The way was comfortable 
enough after such a voyage as I had been upon, and I reached 
my old bower in the evening, where I found everything Standing 
as I left it ; for I always kept it in good order, it being, as I said 
before, my country house. 

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest my 
limbs, for I was very weary, and feil asleep. Judge you, if you 
can, that read my story, what a surprise I must be in when I was 
awaked out of my sleep by a voice calling me by my name several 
times : " Robin, Robin, Robin Crasoe ; poor Robin Crusoe ! Where 
are you, Robin Crusoe ? Where are you ? Where have you been ? " 

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or 

RGB. CRÜ. — 9 



I30 

paddling as it is called, the first part of the day, and with Walking 
the latter part, that I did not wake thoroughly. But dozing between 
sleeping and waking, I dreamed that somebody spoke to me, and as 
the voice continued to repeat, " Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe," at 
last I began to wake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully 
frightened, and started up in the utmost consternation. But no 
sooner were my eyes open but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of 
the hedge, and immediately knew that it was he that spoke to me ; 
for just in such bemoaning language I had i^^ed to talk to him and 
teach him. He had learned it so perfectly'that he would sit upon 
my finger, and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, " Poor Robin 
Crusoe ! Where are you ? Where have you been ? How came 
you here ? " and such things as I had taught him. 

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that indeed 
it could be nobody eise, it was a good while before I could com- 
pose myself. First, I was amazed how the creature got thither ; 
and then, how he should just keep about the place, and nowhere 
eise. But as I was well satisfied it could be nobody but honest 
Poll, I got over it; and holding out my hand, and calling him 
by his name, " Poll," the sociable creature came to me, and sat 
upon my thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to me . 
— Poor Robin Crusoe ! and how did I come here ? and where 
had I been? — just as if he had been overjoyed to see me again. 
So I carried him home along with me. 

I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and 
had enough to do for many days to sit still and reflect upon the 
danger I had been in. I should have been very glad to have 
my boat again on my side of the Island ; but I knew not how it 
was practicable to get it about. As to the east side of the island, 
which I had gone round, I knew well enough there was no ventur- 
ing that way. My very heart would shrink, and my very blood 
run Chili, but to think of it. As to the other side of the island, I 
did not know how it might be there ; but supposing the current 
ran with the same force against the shore at the east as it passed 
by it on the other side, I might run the same risk of being driven 



131 

down the stream, and carried by the Island, as I had been before 
of being carried away from it. With these thoughts, I contented 
myself to be without any boat, though it had been the product of 
so many months' labor to make it, and of so many more to get it 
into the sea. 




In this govemment of my temper I remained near a year, and 
lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose. My 
thoughts being very much composed as to my condition, and 
fully comforted in resigning myself to the dispositions of Provi- 
dence, I thought I lived really very happily in all things except 
that of Society. 

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises 
which my necessities put me upon applying myself to. I believe 



132 

I should, upon occasion, have made a very good carpenter, espe- 
cially considering how few tools I had. 

Besides this, I amved at an unexpected perfection in my earthen- 
ware, and contrived well enough to make them with a wheel, which 
I found infinitely easier and better, because I made things round 
and shaped, which before were filthy things indeed to look on. 
But I think I was never more vain of my own Performance, or 
more joyful for anything I found out, than for my being able to 
make a tobacco pipe. Though it was a very ugly, clumsy thing 
when it was done, and only bumed red, like other earthenware, 
yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the smoke, I was ex- 
ceedingly comforted with it. I had always been used to smoke, 
and there were pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not 
thinking there was tobacco in the island ; and afterwards, when I 
searched the ship again, I could not come at any pipes. 

In my wicker wäre, also, I improved much, and made abundance 
of necessary baskets, as well as my invention showed me. Though 
not very handsome, yet they were such as were very handy and 
convenient for lajdng things up in, or fetching things home. For 
example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, 
flay it, dress it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket. 
And the like by a turtle ; I could cut it up, take out the eggs and 
a piece or two of the flesh, which was enough for me, and bring 
them home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also, large, 
deep baskets were the receivers of my com, which I always rubbed 
out as soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great baskets. 

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably. This 
was a want which it was impossible for me to supply, and I began 
seriously to consider what I must do when I should have no more 
powder ; that is to say, how I should kill any goats. I had, as I 
observed, in the third year of my being here, kept a young kid, 
and bred her up tame, and I was in hopes of getting a he-goat. 
But I could not by any means bring it to pass tili my kid grew an 
old goat ; and as I could never find in my heart to kill her, she 
died at last of mere age. 



133 



CHAPTER XXVII. 

Being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I 
have Said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study 
some art to trap and snare the goats, to see whether I could not 
catch some of them alive. For this purpose I made snares to 
hamper them, and I do believe they were more than once taken 
in them; but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and 
I always found them broken, and my bait devoured. At length 
I resolved to try a pitfall. I dug several large pits in the earth, 
in places where I had observed the goats used to feed, and over 
those pits I placed hurdles, of my own making, too, with a great 
weight upon them. Several times I put ears of barley and dry 
rice, without setting the trap; and I could easily perceive that 
the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn, for I could see the 
marks of their feet. 

At length I set three traps in one night, and, going the next 
moming, I found them all standing, and yet the bait eaten and 
gone. This was very discouraging. However, I altered my traps ; 
and, not to trouble you with particulars, going one moming to see 
my traps, I found in one of them a large, old he-goat, and in one 
of the others three kids, a male and two females. 

As to the old one I knew not what tö do with him. He was so 
fierce I durst not go into the pit to him ; that is to say, to bring 
him away alive, which was what I wanted. I could have killed 
him, but that was not my business, nor would it answer my end. 
So I even let him out, and he ran away as if he had been fright- 
ened out of his wits. But I did not then know what I afterwards 
leamed, that hunger will tarne a lion. If I had let him stay there 
three or four days without food, and then have carried him some 
water to drink, and then a little com, he would have been as tame 
as one of the kids ; for they are mighty sagacious, tractable crea- 
tures where they are well used. 

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at 



134 

that time. Then I went to the three kids, and, taking them one 
by one, I tied them with strings together, and with some difficulty 
brought them all home. 

It was a good while before they would feed ; but, throwing them 
some sweet com, it tempted them, and they began to be tarne. 
And now I found that if I expected to supply myself with goats' 
flesh, when I had no powder or shot left, breeding some up tame 
was my only way, when, perhaps, I might have them about my 
house like a flock of sheep. But then it occurred to me that 
I must keep the tame from the wild, or eise they would always 
run wild when they grew up. The only way for this was to have 
some inclosed piece of ground, well fenced either with hedge or 
pale, to keep them in so effectually that those within might not 
break out, or those without break in. 

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands. Yet, as 
I saw there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first work 
was to find out a proper piece of ground, where there was likely 
to be herbage for them to eat, water for them to drink, and cover 
to keep them from the sun. 

Those who understand such inclosures will think I had very 
little contrivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper for all 
these, (being a piain, open piece of meadow land, or " savannah " 
as our people call it in the western colonies,) which had two or 
three little rills of fresh water in it, and at one end was very 
Woody; I say they will smile at my forecast, when I shall teil 
them I began by inclosing this piece of ground in such a manner 
that my hedge or pale must have been at least two miles about. 
Nor was the madness of it so great as to the compass, for if it was 
ten miles about, I was like to have time enough to do it in ; but 
I did not consider that my goats would be as wild in so much 
compass as if they had had the whole island, and I should have 
so much room to chase them in that I should never catch them. 

My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty 
yards when this thought occurred to me. So I presently stopped 
Short, and, for the beginning, I resolved to inclose a piece of 



135 

about one hundred ^nd fifty yards in length, and one hundred 
yards in breadth, which, as it would maintain as many as I should 
have in any reasonable time, so, as my stock increased, I could 
add more ground to my inclosure. 

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with 
courage. I was about three months hedging in the first piece ; 
and, tili I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the best part 
of it, and accustomed them to feed as near me as possible, to 
make them familiär. Very often I would go and carry them some 
ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my 
band, so that after my inclosure was finished, and I let them 
loose, they would foUow me up and down, bleating after me for a 
handful of corn. 

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had a 
flock of about twelve goats, kids and all. In two years more I 
had three and forty, besides several that I took and killed for my 
food. After that, I inclosed five several pieces of ground to feed 
them in, with little pens to drive them into, to take them as I 
wanted, and gates out of one piece of ground into another. 

But this was not alL Now I not only had goats' flesh to feed 
on when I pleased, but milk too, — a thing which, indeed, in the 
beginning, I did not so much as think of, and which, when it 
came into my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise, for now 
I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a 
day. And as Nature, who gives supplies of food to every creature, 
dictates even naturally how to make use of it, so I, that had never 
milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen butter or cheese made, 
very readily and handily, though after a great many essays and mis- 
carriages, made both butter and cheese at last, |ilso salt (though 
I found it parüy made to my hand by the heat of the sun upon 
some of the rocks of the sea) , and never wanted it afterwards. 

How mercifully can our Creator treat his creatures, even in those 
conditions in which they seem to be overwhelmed in destruction ! 
How can He sweeten the bitterest providences, and give us cause 
to praise Him for dungeons and prisons I What a table was here 



136 

spread for me in the wilderaess, where I saw nothing at first but 
to perish for hunger ! 

It would have made a Stoic^ smile to see me and my little 
family sit down to dinner. There was my majesty, the prince and 
lord of the whole island. I had the lives of all my subjects at my 
absolute command. I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take 
it away, and no rebels among all my subjects. Then, to see how 
like a king I dined, too, all alone, attended by my servants ! Poll, 
as if he had been my favorite, was the only person permitted to 
talk to me. My dog, who was now grown old and crazy, sat always 
at my right hand ; and two cats, one on one side of the table, and 
one on the other, expecting now and then a bit from my hand, aM 
a mark of special favor. 

But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at 
first, for they were both of them dead, and had been interred near 
my habitation by my own hand. These were two of a litter of 
kittens which I had preserved tame, whereas the rest ran wild in 
the woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at last, for they 
would often come into my house, and plunder me too, tili at last 
I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many. At 
length they left me. With this attendance and in this plentiful 
manner I lived; neither could I be said to want anything but 
Society. Of that, some time after this, I was likely to have much. 

I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use 
of my boat, though very loath to run any more hazards. There- 
fore sometimes I sat contriving ways to get her about the island, 
and at other times I sat myself down contented enough without 
her. But I had a stränge uneasiness in my mind to go down to 
the point of th^ island where, as I have said, in my last ramble I 
went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the current set, 
that I might see what I had to do. This inclination increased 
upon me every day, and at length I resolved to travel thither by 
land, following the edge of the shore. I did so ; but had any one 

^ One of a sect of ancient philosophers who professed to be indifferent to 
pleasure or pain. 



137 

in England met such a man as I was, it must either have frightened 
him, or raised a great deal of laughter ; and as I frequently stood 
still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion of my 
traveling through Yorkshire with such an equipage, and in such 
a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure, as foUows : — 

I had a great, high, shapeless cap made of a goat's skin, with a 
Aap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to 
shoot the rain off from ninning into my neck, nothing being so 
hurtful in these climates as the rain upon the flesh under the 
clothes. 

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts Coming down to 
about the middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breeches 
of the same. The breeches were made of the skin of an old he- 
goat, whose hair hung down such a length on either side that, like 
pantaloons, it reached to the middle of my legs. Stockings and 
shoes I had none, but had made me a pair of somethings, I scarce 
know what to call them, like buskins, to Aap over my legs, and 
lace on either side like leggings, but of a most barbarous shape, 
as indeed were all the rest of my clothes. 

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew together 
with two thongs of the same instead of buckles ; and in a kind of 
a frog ^ on either side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung 
a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side and one on the other. I 
had another belt, not so broad, and fastened in the same manner, 
which hung over my Shoulder, and at the end of it, under my left 
arm, hung two pouches, both made of goat's skin too, in one of 
which hung my powder, in the other my shot. At my back I car- 
ried my basket, and on my Shoulder, my gun, and over my head 
a great, clumsy, ugly, goat's-skin umbrella, but which, after all, was 
the most necessary thing I had about me, next to my gun. As for 
my face, the color of it was really not so mulattolike as one might 
expect from a man not at all careful of it, and Hving within nine 
or ten degrees of the equator. My beard I had once suffered 
to grow tili it was about a quarter of a yard long ; but as I had 
1 A loop such as English sailors wore short swords in. 



138 

both scissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except 
what grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large 
pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had seen wora by some 
Turks at Sallee. The Moors did not wear such, though the Turks 
did. Of these mustachios, or whiskers, I will not say they were 
long enough to hang my hat upon them, but they were of a length 
and shape monstrous enough, and such as in England would have 
passed for frightful. 

But all this is by the bye ; for, as to my figure, I had so few to 
observe me that it was of no manaer of consequence ; so I say no 
more of that. In this kind of dress I went my new joumey, and 
was out five or six days. I traveled first along the seashore, 
directly to the place where I first brought my boat to an anchor 
to get upon the rocks. Having no boat now to take care of, I 
went over the land a nearer way to the same height that I was 
upon before, when, looking forward to the points of the rocks 
which lay out, and which I was obliged to double with my boat, as 
is Said above, I was surprised to see the sea all smooth and quiet 
— no rippling, no motion, no current any more there than in any 
other places. 

I was at a stränge loss to understand this, and resolved to spend 
some time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the sets of the 
tide had occasioned it. But I was presently convinced how it 
was ; namely, that the ebb of tide setting from the west, and join- 
ing with the current of waters from some great river on the shore, 
must be the occasion of this current, and that, according as the 
wind blew more forcibly from the west or from the north, this 
current came nearer, or went farther from the shore. Waiting 
thereabouts tili evening, I went up to the rock again, and then the 
ebb of tide being made, I plainly saw the current again as before, 
only that it ran farther off, being near half a league from the shore ; 
whereas in my case it set dose upon the shore, and hurried me 
and my canoe along with it, which at another time it would not 
have done. 

This Observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but 



139 

to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I raight 
very easily bring my boat about the Island again. But when I 
began to think of putting it in practice, I had such terror upon 
my spirits at the remembrance of the danger I had been in that 
I could not think of it again with any patience, but, on the con- 
trary, I took up another resolution, which was more safe, though 
more laborious; and this was that I would build, or rather make, 
me another periagua or canoe, and so have one for one side of the 
Island, and one for the other. 

CHAPTER XXVIII. 

You are to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two 
plantations in the Island, — one, my little fortification or tent, 
with the wall about it, under the rock, with the cave behind me, 
which by this time I had enlarged into several apartments, or 
caves, one within another. One of these, which was the driest 
and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall or fortification, — 
that is to say, beyond where my wall joined to the rock, — was all . 
fiUed up with the large earthen pots of which I have given an 
account, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would 
hold five or six busheis each, where I laid up my stores of pro- 
visions, especially my corn, some in the ear, cut off short from 
the straw, and the other rubbed out with my hand. 

As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles, 
those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so 
big, and spread so very much, that there was not the least appear- 
ance, to any one's view, of any habitation behind them. 

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land, 
and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of com land, which 
I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me 
their harvest in its season; and whenever I had occasion for 
more com, I had more land adjoining as fit as that. 

Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had now a tolerable 
plantation there also. First, I had my little bower, as I called 



140 

it, which I kept in repair, — that is to say, I kept the hedge, which 
circled it in, constantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder 
Standing always in the inside. I kept the trees, which at first 
were no more than stakes, but were now grown very firm and 
tall, always cut, so that they might spread and grow thick and 
wild, and make the more agreeable shade, which they did effectu- 
ally to my mind. In the middle of this I had my tent always 
Standing, being a piece of a sail spread over poles set up for that 
purpose, and which never wanted any repair or renewing. Under 
this I had made a squab, or couch, with the skins of the creatures 
I had killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket laid on 
them, such as belonged to our sea bedding, which I had saved ; 
and a great watch coat to cover me. And here, whenever I had 
occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my country 
habitation. 

Adjoining to this I had my inclosures for my cattle, — that is to 
say, my goats, — and I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to 
fence and inclose this ground. I was so anxious to see it kept 
entire, lest the goats should break through, that I never left off 
tili, with infinite labor, I had .stuck the outside of the hedge 
so fiill of small stakes, and so near to one another, that it was 
rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce room to put 
a hand through between them. When those stakes grew, as they 
all did in the next rainy season, this made the inclosure strong 
like a wall, — indeed stronger than any wall. 

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared 
no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my 
comfortable support. I considered the keeping up a breed of 
tame creatures thus at my hand would be a living magazine, or 
storehouse, of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for me as long 
as I lived in the place, if it were to be forty years ; and that 
keeping them in my reach depended entirely upon my perfect- 
ing my inclosures to such a degree that I might be sure of keep- 
ing them together. By this method, indeed, I so effectually 
secured this that when these little stakes began to grow, I had 



141 

planted them so very thick that I was forced to pull some of them 
up again. In this place, also, I had my grapes growing, upon which 
I principally depended for my winter störe of raisins, and which 
I never failed to preserve very carefuUy, as the best and most 
agreeable dainty of my whole diet. And indeed they were not 
only agreeable, but medicinal, wholesome, nourishing, and refresh- 
ing in the greatest degree. 

As this was also about halfway between my other habitation and 
the place where I had laid up my boat, I generally stayed and lay 
here in my way thither, for I used frequently to visit my boat ; 
and I kept all things about, or belonging to her, in very good 
Order. Sometimes I went out in her to divert myself, but no more 
hazardous voyages would I go, nor scarcely ever above a stone's 
cast or two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurried 
out of my knowledge again by the currents, or winds, or any other 
accident. But now I come to a new scene of my life. 

It happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat I was 
exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot on the 
shore, which was very piain to be seen on the sand. I stood like 
one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition. I listened, I 
looked round me, but I could hear nothing, nor see anything. I 
went up to a rising ground to look farther. I went up the shore, 
and down the shore, but it was all one. I could see no other im- 
pression but that one. I went to it again to see if there were any 
more, and to observe if it might not be my fancy ; but there was 
no room for that, for there was exactly the print of a foot, — toes, 
heel, and every part of a foot. How it came thither I knew not, 
nor could I in the least imagine. After innumerable fluttering 
thoughts, like a man perfectly coniused and out of himself, I came 
home to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground I went 
on, but terrified to the last degree, looking behind me at every 
two or three Steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and fencying 
every stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it possible to de- 
scribe how many various shapes my affrighted imagination repre- 
sented things to me in, how many wild ideas were found every 



142 

moment in my fancy^ and what stränge, unaccountable whimseys 
came into my thoughts by the way. 

When I carae to my Castle (for so I think I called it ever after 
this), I fled into it like one pursued. Whether I went over by the 
ladder, as first contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which 
I had called a door, I cannot remember. No, nor could I re- 
member the next morning ; for never frightened hare fled to cover, 
or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than I to this retreat. , 

I slept none that night. The farther I was from the occasion of 
my fright, the greater my apprehensions were, which is something 
contrary to the nature of such things, and especially to the usual 
practice of all creatures in fear. But I was so embarrassed with my 
own frightful ideas of the thing that I formed nothing but dismal 
imaginations to myself. How was it possible a man should come 
there? Where was the vessel that brought him? What marks 
were there of any other footstep ? 

I presently concluded, then, that it must be some dangerous 
creature ; namely, that it must be some of the savages of the main- 
land opposite, who had wandered out to sea in their canoes, and, 
either driven by the currents or by contrary winds, had made the 
island, and had been on shore, but were gone away again to sea ; 
being as loath, perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate island as I 
would have been to have had them. 

While these reflections were roUing in my mind, I was very 
thankful in my thoughts that I was so happy as not to be there- 
abouts at that time, or that they did not see my boat, by which 
they would have concluded that some inhabitants had been in the 
place, and perhaps have searched farther for me. 

Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about their hav- 
ing found out my boat, and that there were people here ; and 
that, if so, I should certainly have them come again in- greater 
numbers, and devour me; that if it should happen that they 
should not find me, yet they would find my inclosure, destroy all 
my com, and carry away all my flock of tarne goats, and I should 
perish at last for mere want. 



143 

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, — all that fortner 
confidence in God, which was founded upon such wonderful ex- 
perience as I had had of his goodness ; as if he that had fed me 
by miracle hitherto could not preserve, by his power, the Provi- 
sion which he' had made for me by his goodness. I reproached 
myself with my laziness, that would not sow any more com onc 
year than would just serve me tili the next season, as if no acci- 
dent could intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was 
upon the ground. This I thought so just a reproof that I resolved 
for the fliture to have two or three years' com beforehand, so that, 
whatever might come, I might not perish for want 6f bread. 

How Strange a checkerwork of Providence is the life of man ! 
and by what different, secret Springs are the affections hurried 
about, as different circumstances present ! To-day we love what 
to-morrow we hate; to-day we seek what to-morrow we shun; 
to-day we desire what to-morrow we fear, — nay, even tremble at 
the apprehensions of. This was exemplified in me, at this time, 
in the most lively manner imaginable ; for I, whose only affliction 
was that I seemed banished from human society, that I was alone, 
cut off from mankind, and condemned to what I call silent life, so 
that to have seen one of my own species would have seemed to 
me a raising me from death to life, and the greatest blessing that 
Heaven itself could bestow ; I say, that I should now tremble at 
the very apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to sink 
into the ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man 
having set his foot in the island ! 

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, — nay, I may say 
weeks and months ; and one particular effect of my cogitations on 
this occasion I cannot omit. One morning early, lying in my 
bed, and filled with thoughts abbut my danger from the appear- 
ance of savages, I. found it discomposed me very much ; upon 
which these words of the Scripture came into my thoughts : " Call 
upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou 
shalt glorify me." 

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflec- 



144 

tions, it came into my thoughts one day that all this might be a 
mere fancy of ray own, and that this foot might be the print of 
my own foot when I came on shore from my boat. This cheered 
me up a little, too, and I began to persuade myself it was all a 
delusion ; that it was nothing eise but my own foot. Why might 
I not come that way from the boat, as well as I was going that 
way to the boat ? Again I considered, also, that I could by no 
means teil, for certain, where I had trod, and where I had not. 
If, at last, this was only the print of my own foot, I had played 
the part of those fools who try to make stories of specters and 
apparitions, and then are frightened at them more than anybody. 

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for 
I had not stirred out of my Castle for three days and nights, so 
that I began to starve for provisions ; for I had little or nothing 
within doors but some barley cakes and water. Then I knew 
that my goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was my 
cvening diversion; and the poor creatures were in great pain 
and inconvenience for want of it. Indeed, it almost spoiled some 
of them, and almost dried up their milk. Encouraging myself, 
therefore, with the belief that this was nothing but the print of 
one of my own feet, and that I might be truly said to Start at my 
own shadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to my country 
house to milk my flock. But to see with what fear I went forward, 
how often I looked behind me, how I was ready, every now and 
then, to lay down my basket and run for my life, it would have 
made any one think I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that 
I had been lately most terribly frightened ; and so, indeed, I had. 

However, I went down thus two or three days, and having seen 
nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to think there was 
really nothing in it but my own imagination. But I could not 
persuade myself fully of this tili I should go down to the shore 
again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my own, and 
see if there was any similitude or fitness, that I might be assured 
it was my own foot. But when I came to the place, first, it 
appeared evidendy to me that when I laid up my boat, I could 



US 

not possibly be on shore anywhere thereabouts ; secondly, when I 
came to measure the mark with my own foot, I found my foot 
not so large by a great deal. Both these things ßUed my head 
with new imaginations, and gave me the vapors again to the 
highest degree, so that I shook with cold like one in an ague. I 
went home again, filled with the belief that some man or men had 
been on shore there ; or, in short, that the island was inhabited, 
and I might be surprised before I was aware. What course to 
take for my secnrity I knew not. 

.. Oh, what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with 
fear ! It deprives them of the use of those means which reason 
offers for their relief. The first thing I proposed to myself was 
to throw down my inclosures, and tum all my tame cattle wild 
into the woods, lest the enemy should find them and then fre- 
quent the island in prospect of the same or the like booty ; then 
the simple thing of digging up my two comfields, lest they should 
find such a grain there, and still be prompted to frequent the 
island ; then to demolish my bower and tent, that they might not 
see any vestiges of habitation and be prompted to look fiarther 
in Order to find out the persons inhabiting. 

CHAPTER XXIX. 

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night. But 
in the moming I feil asleep ; and, having by the amusement of 
my mind been, as it were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept 
very soundly, and waked much better composed than I had ever 
been before. And now I began to think sedately; and, upon 
debate with myself, I concluded that this island, which was so 
exceedingly pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the mainland 
than as I had seen^ was not so entirely abandoned as I might 
imagine; that although there were no stated inhabitants who 
lived on the spot, yet that there might sometimes come boats off 
from the shore, who, either with design, or perhaps never but 
when they were driven by cross winds, might come to this place ; 

ROB. CRU. — lO 



146 

that I had lived here fifteen years now, and had not met with 
the least shadow or figure of any people yet ; and that, if at any 
time they should be driven.here, it was probable they would go away 
again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had never thought 
fit to fix here upon any occasion ; that the most I could suggest 
any danger from, was from any casual, accidental landing of strag- 
gling people from the main, who, as it was likely, if they were 
driven hither, were here against their wills, so they made no stay 
here, but went off again with all possible speed, seldom staying 
one night on shore, lest they should not have the help of the tides 
and daylight back again ; and that, therefore, I had nothing to 
do but to consider of some safe retreat, in case I should see any 
savages land upon the spot. 

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large 
as to bring a door through again, which door, as I said, came out 
beyond where my fortification joined to the rock. Upon maturely 
considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second fortifi- 
cation, in the manner of a semicircle, at a distance from my wall, 
just where I had planted a double row of trees about twelve years 
before, of which I made mention. These trees having been 
planted so thick before, they wanted but a few piles to be driven 
between them, that they might be thicker and stronger, and my 
wall would be soon finished. 

Thus I had now a double wall ; and my outer wall was thickened 
with pieces of timber, old cables, and everything I could think of, 
to make it strong ; having in it seven little holes, about as big as I 
tnight put my arm out at. In the inside of this I thickened my 
wall to about ten feet thick, with continually bringing carth out of 
my cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and Walking upon it. 
Through the seven holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which 
I took notice that I had got seven on shore out of the ship. 
These, I say, I planted like my cannon and fitted them into frames 
that held them like a carriage, so that I could fire all the seven 
guns in two minutes* time. This wall I was many a weary month 
in finishing, and yet never thought myself safe tili it was done. 



1 



147 

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall^ 
for a great length every way, as füll with stakes or sticks of the 
osierlike wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they could well 
stand 3 insomuch that I believe I might set in near twenty thou- 
sand of them, leaving a pretty large space between them and my 
wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, and they might 
have noshelter from the young trees, if they attempted to. approach 
my outer wall. 

Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove ; and in five or 
six years* time I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so mon- 
strously thick and strong that it was indeed perfectly impassable. 
No men, of what kind soever, could ever imagine that there was 
anything beyond it, much less a habitation. As for the way which 
I proposed to myself to go in and out (for I left no avenue), it 
was by setting two ladders, one to a part of the rock which was 
low, and then broke in, and left room to place another ladder 
upon that. So when the two ladders were taken down, no man 
living could come down to me without doing himself mischief ; 
and if they had come down, they were still on the outside of my 
outer wall. 

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for 
my own preservation. It will be seen, at length, that they were 
not altogether without just reason ; though I foresaw nothing at 
that time more than my mere fear suggested to me. 

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other 
affairs ; for I had a great concem upon me for my little herd of 
goats. They were not only a ready supply to me on every occa- 
sion, and began to be sufficient for me, without the expense of 
powder and shot, but also without the fatigue of hunting after the 
wild one ; and I was loath to lose the advantage of them, and to 
have them all to nurse up over again. 

For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but 
two ways to preserve them. One was, to find another convenient 
place to dig a cave Underground, and to drive them into it every 
night. The other was to inclose two or three little bits of land, 



148 

remote from one another, and as much concealed as I could, 
where I might keep about half a dozen young goats in each place ; 
so that if any disaster happened to the flock in general, I might 
be able to raise them again with little trouble and time. This, 
though it would require a good deal of time and labor, I thought 
was the most rational design. 

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired 
parts of the island ; and I pitched upon one which was as private, 
indeedy ^as my heart could wish for. It was a little, damp piece of 
ground, in the middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is 
observed, I almost lost myself once before, endeavoring to come 
back that way from the eastem part of the island. Here I found 
a clear piece of land, near three acres, so surrounded with woods 
that it was almost an inclosure by nature. At least, it did not 
want near so much labor to make it so as the other piece of 
ground I had worked so hard at 

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground ; and, in 
less than a month's time, I had so fenced it round that my flock, 
or herd, call it which you please, which were not so wild now as at 
first they might be supposed to be, were well enough secured in it. 

So, without any further delay, I removed ten young she-goats, 
and two he-goats, to this piece. When they were there, I con- 
tinued to perfect the fence, tili I had made it as secure as the 
other ; which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up 
more time by a great deal. All this labor I was at the expense 
of, purely from my apprehensions on account of the print of a 
man*s foot; for, as yet, I had never seen any human creature 
come near the island. 

I had now lived two years under this uneasiness, which, indeed, 
made my life much less comfortable than it was before, as may be 
well imagined by any who know what it is to live in the constant 
snare of the fear of man. And this I must observe, with grief, toa 
that the discomposure of my mind had great impression also upon 
the religious part of my thoughts ; for the dread and terror of fall- 
ing into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits 



149 

that I seldom found myself with the sedate calmness and resigna- 
tion of soul which I was wont to have. I rather prayed to God 
as under great affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with 
danger, and in expectation every night of being murdered and 
devoured before moming ; and I must testify, from my experience, 
that a temper of peace, thank^lness, love, and affection is much 
the more proper frame for prayer than that of terror and discom- 
posure. 

But to go on. After I had thus secured one part of my little 
living stock, I went about the whole island, searching for another 
private place to make such another deposit; when, wandering 
more to the west point of the island than I had ever done yet, and 
looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea, at a great 
distance. I had found a perspective glass or two in one of the 
seamen's che§ts, which I saved out of our ship, but I had it not 
about me ; and this was so remote that I could not teil what to 
make of it, though I looked at it tili my eyes were not able to 
hold to look any longer. Whether it was a boat or not, I do not 
know ; but as l descended from the hill I could see no more of 
it, so I gave it over ; only I resolved to go no more out without a 
perspective giass in my pocket. 

When I was come down the hill to the end of the island, where, 
indeed, I had never been before, I was presently convinced that 
the seeing the print of a man*s foot was not such a stränge thing 
in the island as I imagined ; and but that it was a special provi- 
dence that I was cast upon the side of the island where the savages 
never came, I should easily have known that nothing was more 
frequent than for the canoes from the main, when they happened 
to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the 
island for harbor. Likewise, as they often met and fought in their 
canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners, would bring them 
over to this shore, where, according to their dreadful customs, 
being all cannibals, they would kill and eat them ; of which more 
hereafter. 

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above. 



ISO 

being the Southwest point of the island, I was perfectly confounded 
and amazed, nor is it possible for me to express the horror of my 
mind, at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other 




bones of human bodies. Particularly, I observed a place where 
there had been a fire raade, and a circle dug in the earth, like a 
Cockpit, where I supposed the savage wretches had sat down to 
their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures. 



151 

I was so astonished with the sight of these things that I ettter- 
tained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a long while. 
AU my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch 
of inhuman brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human 
nature, which, though I had heard of it often, yet I never had so 
near a view of before. In short, I turned away my face from the 
horrid spectacle. My stomach grew sick, and I was just at the 
point of fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from my 
stomach. I was then a little relieved, but could not bear to stay 
in the place a moment ; so I got up the hill again with all the 
speed I could, and walked on towards my own habitation. 

When I came a little out of that part of the Island, I stood still 
awhile, as amazed. Then, recovering myself, I looked up with the 
utmost affection of my soul,'and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, 
gave God thanks that he had cast my first lot in a part of the 
World where I was distinguished from such dreadful creatures as 
these; and thät, though I had esteemed my present condition 
very miserable, yet he had given me so many comforts in it that 
I had still more to give thanks for than to complain of ; and this 
above all, that I had, even in this miserable condition, been 
comforted with the knowledge of himself, and the hope of his 
blessing, which was a felicity more than sufficiently equivalent 
to all the misery which I had suffered, or could suffer. 

In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my Castle, and 
began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my circum- 
stances, than ever I was before. For I observed that these 
wretches never came to this Island in search of what they could 
get ; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting, anything 
h^i-e, and having often, no doubt, been up in the covered, woody 
part of it without finding anything to their purpose. I knew I 
had been here now almost eighteen years, and never saw the 
least footsteps of human creature there before ; and I might be 
eighteen years more as entirely concealed as I was now if I did 
not discover myself to them, which I had no manner of occasion 
to do, it being my only business to keep myself entirely concealed 



IS2 

where I was, unless I found a better sort of creatures than canni- 
bals to make myself known to. 

Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches 
that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched, inhuman cus- 
tom of their devouring and eating one another up, that I continued 
pensive and sad, and kept close within my own circle, for almost 
two years after this. When I say my own circle, I mean by it 
my three plantations, — namely, my Castle, my country seat (which 
I called my bower) , and my inclosure in the woods ; nor did I 
look after this for any other use than as an inclosure for my 
goats. I did not so much as go to look after my boat all this 
time, but began rather to think of malcing me another; for I 
could not think of ever making any more attempts to bring the 
other boat round the Island to me, lest I should meet with some 
of these creatures at sea ; in which case if I happened to have 
fallen into their hands, I knew what would have been my lot. 



CHAPTER XXX. 

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no 
danger of being discovered by these people, began to wear off 
my uneasiness about them. I began to live just in the same 
composed manner as before, only with this difference, that I used 
more caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I did before, 
lest I should happen to be seen by any of them ; and particularly, 
I was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of them, being on 
the island, should happen to hear it. It was, therefore, a very 
good providence to me that I had furnished myself with a tame 
breed of goats, and that I had no need to hunt any more about 
the woods, or shoot at them. If I did catch any of them after 
this, it was by traps and snares, as I had done before, so that 
for two years after this I believe I never fired my gun off once, 
though I never went out without it; and, what was more, as I 
had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried them out 






153 

with me, — or at least two of them, — sticking them in my goat- 
skin belt. I also furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I 
had out of the ship, and made me a belt to hang it on also; 
so that I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I 
went abroad, if you add to the former description of myself the 
particular of two pistols, and a great broadsword hanging at my 
side in a belt, but without a scabbard. 

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed, 
excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm, sedate 
way of living. All these things tended to show me, more and 
more, how far my condition was ftom being miserable, compared 
to some others, — nay, to many other particulars of life, which it 
might have pleased God to have made my lot It put me upon 
reüecting how little repining there would be among mankind at 
any condition of life, if people would rather compare their condi- 
tion with those that were worse, in order to be thankful, than be 
always comparing them with those which are better, to assist their 
murmurings and complainings. 

As in my present condition there were not really many things 
which I wanted, so, indeed, I thought that the frights I had been 
in about these savage wretches, and the concem I had been in for 
my own preservation, had taken off the edge of my invention for 
my own conveniences. I had dropped a good design, which I had 
once bent my thoughts too much upon, and that was to try if I 
could not make some of my barley into malt, and then try to brew 
myself some beer. This was really a whimsical thought, and I 
reproved myself often for the simplicity of it ; for I presently saw 
there would be the want of several things necessary for the making 
my beer, that it would be impossible for me to supply. First, I 
needed casks to preserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have 
observed already, I could never compass, — no, though I spent not 
only many days, but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to 
no purpose. In the next place, I had no hops to make it keep, 
no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to make it boil. 
Yet with all these things wanting, I verily believe, had not the 



154 

frights and terrors I was in about the savages intervened, I had 
undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass, too ; for I seldom 
gave anything over without accomplishing it, when once I had it 
in my head enough to begin it. 

But my invention now ran quite another way ; for, night and day, 
I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these 
monsters in their cruel, bloody entertainment ; and, if possible, 
save the victim they should bring hither to destroy. It would 
take up a larger volume than this whole work is intended to be, 
to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or rather brooded 
upon, in my thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at 
least frightening them so as to prevent their coming hither any 
more ; but all this came to nought Nothing could be possible 
to take effect, unless I was to be there to do it myself ; and what 
could one man do among them, when perhaps there might be 
twenty or thirty of them together, with their darts, or their bows 
and arrows, with which they could shoot as true to a mark as I 
could with my gun ? 

Sometimes 1 thought of digging a hole under the place where 
they made their fire, and putting in five or six pounds of gun- 
powder, which, when they kindled their fire, would consequently 
take fire, and blow up all that was near it. But as, in the first 
place, I should be unwilling to waste so much powder upon them, 
my Store being now within the quantity of one barrel, so neither 
could I be sure of its going off at any certain time, when it might 
surprise them ; and, at best, that it would do little more than just 
blow the fire about their ears and fi-ight them, but not sufficient 
to make them forsake the place. So I laid it aside; and then 
proposed that I would place myself in ambush in some convenient 
place, with my three guns all double loaded, and in the middle of 
their bloody ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure to 
kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shot ; and then falling 
in upon them with my three pistols and my sword, I made no 
doubt but that, if there were twenty, I should kill them all. This 
Cancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and I was so füll of it 



155 

that I often dreamed of it, and sometimes that I was just going to 
let fly at them in my sleep. I went so far with it in my imagina- 
tion that I employed myself several days to find out proper places 
to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to watch for them, and I 
went frequently to the place itself, which was now grown more 
familiär to me. But while my mind was thus fiUed with thoughts 
of revenge and a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the 
sword, as I may call it, the horror I had at the place, and at the 
Signals of the barbarous wretches devouring one another, abetted 
my malice. 

Well, at length I found a place in the side of the hill, where 
I was satisfied I might securely wait tili I saw any of their boats 
Coming; and might then, even before they would be ready to 
come on shore, convey myself unseen into some thickets of trees, 
in one of which there was a hoUow large enough to conceal me 
entirely. There I might sit and observe all their bloody doings, 
and take my füll aim at their heads, when they were so close 
together as that it would be next to irapossible that I should miss 
my shot, or that I could fail of wounding three or four of them at 
the first shot. In this place, then, I resolved '^ fulfiU my design ; 
and accordingly I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling 
piece. The two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and 
four or five smaller buUets, about the size of pistol buUets ; and 
the fowling piece I loaded with near a handful of swan shot of 
the largest size. I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets 
each ; and, in this posture, well provided with ammunition for a 
second and third Charge, I prepared myself for my expedition. 

After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my 
imagination put it in practice, 1 continually made my tour every 
morning to the top of the hill, which was from my Castle, as I 
called it, about three miles, or more, to see if I could observe 
any boats upon the sea, Coming near the island, or Standing over 
towards it ; but I began to tire of this hard duty, after I had for 
two or three months constantly kept my watch, but always carae 
back without any discovery. There had not, in all that time, 



156 

been the least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but on 
the whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glass could reach every 
way. 

As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to look out, so 
long also I kept up the vigor of my design, and my spirits seemed 
to be all the while in a suitable frame for so outrageous an execution 
as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for an offense which 
I had not at all entered into any discussion of in my thoughts, any 
farther than my passions were at first fired by the horror I con- 
ceived at the unnatural custora of the people of that country. But 
now, when, as I have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless 
excursion which I had made so long and so far every moraing in 
vain, so my opinion of the action itself began to alter. I began, 
with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what I was going to 
engage in ; what authority or call I had to pretend to be judge and 
executioner upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven had 
thought fit, for so many ages, to suffer, unpunished, to go on ; how 
far these people were offenders against me, and what right I had to 
engage in the quarrel of that blood which they shed promiscuously 
upon one anothei*}?^^ I debated this very often with myself thus : 
" How do I know what God himself judges in this particular case ? 
It is certain these people do not commit this as a crime ; it is not 
against their own consciences reproving, or their light reproach- 
ing them ; they do not know it to be an offense, and then commit 
it in defiance of divine justice, as we do in almost all the sins we 
commit. They think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in 
war, than we do to kill an ox ; or to eat human flesh, than we do 
to eat mutton." 

When I considered this a little, it foUowed necessarily that I was 
certainly in the wrong ; that these people were not murderers in 
the sense that I had before condemned them in my thoughts. In 
the next place, it occurred to me that although the usage they 
gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it was really 
nothing to me. These people had done me no injury. If they 
attempted me, or I saw it necessary for my immediate preservation 



157 



to fall upon them, something might be said for it ; but I was yet 
out of their power, and they really had no knowledge of me, and 
consequently no design upon me. 



CHAPTER XXXI. 

In this disposition I continued for near a yftir after this ; and 
so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these 
wretches, that in all that time I never once went up the hill to see 
whether there were any of them in sight, or to know whether any 
of them had been on shore there or not. I went and removed 
my boat, which I had on the other side of the island, and carried 
it down to the east end of the whole island, where I ran it into a 
little cove, which I found under some high rocks, and where I 
knew, by reason of the currents, the savages durst not — at least 
would not — come with their boats upon any account whatever. 
With my boat I carried away everything that I had left there be- 
longing to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither, — 
namely, a mast and sail which I had made for her, and a thing 
like an anchor, but which indeed could not be called either anchor 
or grapnel ; however, it was the best I could make of its kind. 
All these I removed, that there might not be the least shadow for 
discovery, or appearance of any boat, or of any human habitation 
upon the island. 

Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than ever, 
and seldom went from my cell except upon my constant employ- 
ment, — to milk my she-goats, and manage my little flock in the 
wood, which, as it was quite on the other part of the island, was 
out of danger. For certain it is that these savage people, who 
sometimes haunted this island, never came with any thoughts of 
finding anything here, and consequently never wandered off from 
the coast, and I doubt not but they might have been several times 
on shore after my apprehensions of them had made me cautious, 
as well as before. Indeed, I looked back with some horror upon 



IS8 

the thoughts of what my condition woüld have been if I had 
chanced upon them and been discovered before; when, naked, 
and unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded often only 
with small shot, I walked everywhere, peeping and peering about 
the Island to see what I could get. What a surprise should I have 
been in if, when I discovered the print of a man's foot, I had, 
instead of that, seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found them 
pursuing me, and/by the swiftness of their running, no possibility 
of my escaping them ! The thoughts of this sometimes sank my 
very soul within me, and distressed my mind so much that I 
could not soon recover it, to think what I should have done, and 
how I should not only have been unable to resist them, but even 
should not have had presence of mind enough to do what I might 
have done ; much less what now, after so much consideration and 
preparation, I might be able to do. Indeed, after serious think- 
ing of these things, I would be melancholy, and, sometimes, it 
would last a great while. 

I believe the reader of this will not think it stränge if I con- 
fess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and 
the concem that was now upon me, put an end to all invention, 
and to all the contrivances that I had laid for my future accom- 
modations and conveniences. I had the care of my safety more 
now upon my hands than that of my food. I cared not to drive 
a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I might 
make should be heard. Much less would I fire a gun, for the 
same reason ; and, above all, I was intolerably uneasy at making 
any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the 
day, should betray me. For this reason I removed that part of 
my business which required fire, such as buming of pots and pipes, 
etc., into my new apartment in the woods ; where, after I had been 
some time, I found to my unspeakable consolation a mere natural 
cave in the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I dare 
say, no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy 
as to venture in ; . nor, indeed, would any man eise, but one who, 
like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat. 



159 

The mouth of this hoUow was at the bottom of a great rock, 
where, by mere accident, I would say, if I did not see abundant 
reason to ascribe all such things now to Providence, I was cutting 
down some thick branches of trees to make charcoal. Before I 
go on I must observe the reason of my making this charcoal, which 
was this : I was afraid of making a sinoke about my habitation, as 
I Said before; and yet I could not live there without baking my 
bread, cooking my meat, etc. So I contrived to bum some wood 
here, as I had seen done in England, under turf, tili it became 
chark, or dry coal. Then putting the fire out, I preserved the 
coal to carry home, and perform the other Services for which fire 
was wanting, without danger of smoke. But this is by the bye. 

While I was cutting down some wood here, I perceived that 
behind a very thick branch of low brushwood or underwood, there 
was a kind of hoUow place. I was curious to look into it ; and 
getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I foimd it was pretty 
large, — that is to say, sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and 
perhaps another with me. But I must confess to you that I made 
more haste out than I did in, when, looking farther into the place, 
which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad, shining eyes of some 
creature, whether devil or man I knew not, which twinkled like 
two Stars, the dim light from the cave*s mouth shining directly in, 
and making the reflection. 

However, after some pause, I recovered myself, and began to 
call myself a thousand fools, and to think that he that was afraid 
to see the devil, was not fit to live twenty years in an island all 
alone, and that I might well think there was nothing in this cave 
that was more frightful than myself. Upon this, plucking up my 
courage, I took up a firebrand, and in I rushed again, with the 
stick flaming in my hand. I had not gone three Steps in, before I 
was almost as much frightened as before ; for I heard a very loud 
sigh, like that of a man in some pain, and it was followed by a 
broken noise, as of words half expressed, and then a deep sigh 
again. I stepped back, and was indeed Struck with such a sur- 
prise that it put me into a cold sweat, and if I had had a hat on 



i6o 

my head, I will not answer for it that my hair might not have lifted 
it off. But still plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and 
encouraging myself a little with considering that the power and 
presence of God was everywhere, and was able to protect me, I 
stepped forward again. 

By the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little over my 
head, I saw lying on the ground a monstrous, frightful, old he-goat, 
gasping for life, and dying, indeed, of mere old age. I stirred 
him a little to see if I could get him out, and he essayed to get 
üp, but was not able to raise himself. I thought with myself he 
might even lie there ; for if he had frightened me, so he would 
certainly frighten any of the savages, if any of them should be 
so hardy as to come in there while he had any life in him. 

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round 
me, when I found the cave was but very small ; that is to say, it 
might be about twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, neither 
round nor Square, no hands having ever been employed in making 
it but those of mere nature. I observed also that there was a 
place at the farther side of it that went in farther, but was so low 
that it required me to creep upon my hands and knees to go into 
it, and whither it went I knew not. So, having no candle, I gave 
it over for that time, but resolved to go again the next day, pro- 
vided with candles and a tinder box, which I had made of the lock 
of one of the muskets, with some wildfire ^ in the pan. 

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large candles 
of my own making, (for I made very good candles now of goat's 
tallow, but was hard set for candle wicks, using sometimes rags or 
rope-yam, and sometimes the dried rind of a weed like nettles ;) 
and going into this low^place I was obliged to creep upon all fours, 
as I have said, almost ten yards ; which, by the way, I thought 
was a venture bold enough, considering that I knew not how far it 
might go, nor what was beyond it. When I had got through the 
strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty feet. 
But never was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as 

1 A mixture which readily catches fire and is hard to put out. 



i6i 

it was to look round the sides and roof of this vault or cave. The 
w^all reflected a hundred thousand lights to me from my two 
candles. What it was in the rock, — whether diamonds or any 
other precious stones, or gold, which I rather supposed it to be, 
— I knew not. The place I was in was a most delightful cavity, 
or grotto, though perfectly dark. The floor was dry and level, 
and had a sort of small, loose gravel upon it, so that there was no 
nauseous or venomous creature to be seen, neither was there any 
damp or wet on the sides or roof. 

The only difficulty in it was the entrance, which, however, as it 
was a place of security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought 
was a convenience ; so that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, 
and resolved, without any delay, to bring some of those things 
which I was most anxious about to this place. Particularly, I re-' 
solved to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my spare 
arms; namely, two fowling pieces — for I had three in all — and 
three muskets — for of them I had eight in all. So I kept in my 
Castle only five, which stood ready mounted like pieces of cannon 
on my outpost fence, and were ready also to take out upon any 
expedition. Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition I 
happened to open the barrel of powder which I took üp out pf 
the sea, and which had been wet, and I found that the water had 
penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on every 
side, which caking and growing hard, had preserved the inside 
like a kemel in the shell, so that I had near sixty pounds of very 
good powder in the center of the cask. This was a very agreeable 
discovery to me at that time ; so I carried all away thither, never 
keeping above two or three pounds of powder with me in my» 
Castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind. I also carried thither all 
the lead I had left for bullets. ' '' 

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who were 
said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where nonie could 
come at them. I persuaded myself, while I was here, that if üver 
hundred savages were to hunt me, they could never find me out ';■ 
or if they did, they would not venture to attack me here. The:

l62 

old goat whom I found expiring, died in the mouth of the cave the 
next day after I made this discovery ; and I found it much easier 
to dig a great hole there, and throw him in and cover him with 
earthy than to drag him out. 

I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this 
island, and was so naturalized to the place and the manner of 
living that, could I but have enjoyed the certainty that no 
savages would come to the place to disturb me, I could have 
been content to capitulate for spending the rest of my time there, 
even to the last moment, tili I had laid me down and died, like 
the old goat in the cave. I had also arrived to some little diver- 
sions and amusements, which made the time pass a great deal 
more pleasantly with me than it did before. First, I had taught 
my Poll, as I named before, to speak ; and he did it so familiarly, 
and talked so articulately and piain, that it was very pleasant to 
me; and he lived with me no less than six-and-twenty years. 
How long he might have lived afterwards I know not, though I 
know they have a notion in Brazil that they live a hundred years. 
My dog was a pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than 
sixteen years of my time, and then died of mere old age. As for 
my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, to that degree that 
I was obliged to shoot several of them at first, to keep them from 
devouring me and all I had ; but, at length, when the two old ones 
I brought with me were gone, and after some time continually 
driving them from me, and letting them have Ho provision with 
me, they all ran wild into the woods, except two or three favorites, 
which I kept tame, and whose young, when they had any, I always 
drowned ; and these were part of my family. 

Besides these I always kept two or three household kids about 
me, which I taught to feed out of my band. And I had two 
more parrots, which talked pretty well, and would all call " Robin 
Crusoe," but none like my first ; nor, indeed, did I take the pains 
with any of them that I had done with him. I had also several 
tame sea fowls, whose name I knew not, that I caught upon the 
shore, and cut their wings; and the little stakes which I had 



i63 

planted before my Castle wall being now grown up to a göod 
thick grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees, and bred 
there, which was very agreeable to me ; so that, as I said above, I 
began to be very well contented with the life I led, if I could have 
been secured from the dread of the savages. 

But it was otherwise directed ; and it may not be amiss for all 
people who shall meet with my story to make this just Observation 
from it ; namely, how frequently, in the course of our lives, the 
evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we 
are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very 
means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we can be 
raised again from the affliction we are fallen into. I could give 
many examples of this in the course of my unaqcountable life ; but 
in nothing was it more particularly remarkable than in the circum- 
stances of my last years of solitary residence in this island. 



CHAPTER XXXII. 

It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my 
twenty-third year ; and this, being the southem solstice (for winter 
I cannot call it), was the particular time of my harvest, and re- 
quired me to be pretty much abroad in the fields. Going out early 
in the moming, even before it was thorough daylight, I was sur- 
prised with seeing a light of some fire upon the shore, at a distance 
from me of about two miles, toward that part of the island where 
I had observed some savages had been before ; not on the other 
side, — but, to my great affliction, it was on my side of the island. 

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short 
within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised. 
And yet I had no more peace within, from the apprehensions I 
had that if these savages, in rambling over the island, should find 
my com Standing or cut, or any of my works or improvements, 
they would immediately conclude that there were people in the 
place, and would then never rest tili they had found me out. In this 



•164 

extremity I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder 
after me, and made all things without look as wild and natural as 
I could. 

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of 
defense. I loaded all my cannon, as I called them, — that is to 
say my muskets, — which were mounted upon my new fortification, 
and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the last gasp, 
not forgetting seriously to commend myself to the divine pro- 
tection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver me out of the 
hands of the barbarians. I continued in this posture about two 
hours, and began to be impatient for intelligence abroad, for I 
had no spies to send out. After sitting a while longer, and mus- 
ing what I should do in this case, I was not able to bear sitting 
in jgnorance longer. So, setting up my ladder to the side of the 
hill, where there was a flat place, as I observed before, and then 
puUing the ladder after me, I set it up again and mounted the top 
of the hill, and puUing out my perspective glass, which I had taken 
on purpose, I laid me down flat on the ground, and began to look 
for the place. I presently found there were no less than nine 
naked savages sitting round a small fire they had made, not to 
warm them, for they had no need of that, the weather being ex- 
tremely hot, but, as I supposed, to dress some of their barbarous 
diet of human flesh which they had brought with them, whether 
alive or dead I could not teil. 

They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up 
upon the shore ; and as it was then ebb of tide, they seeme4 to 
me to wait for the retum of the flood to go away again. It is not 
easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into, especially 
seeing them come on my side of the island, and so near to me. 
But when I considered their Coming must be always with the cur- 
rent of the ebb, I began afterwards to be more sedate in my mind, 
being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety all the time of 
the flood of tide, if they were not on shore before. Having made 
this Observation, I went abroad about my harvest work with the 
more composure. 



\6s 

As I expected so it proved ; for, as soon as the tide made to 
the westward, I saw them all take boat and row (or paddle as we 
call it) away. I should have observed that for an hour or more 
before they went off they were dancing, and I could easily discern 
their postures and gestures by ray glass. 

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two gnns upon 
my Shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my great sword 
by my side, without a scabbard, and, with all the speed I was able 
to make, went away to the hill where I had discovered the first 
appearance of all. As soon as I got thither, which was in not less 
than two hours, (for I could not go quickly, being so loaded with 
arms as I was,) I perceived there had been three canoes more of 
the savages at that place ; and, looking out farther, I saw they were 
all at sea together, making over for the main. This was a dread- 
ful sight to me, especially as, going down to the shore, I could see 
the marks of horror which the dismal work they had been about 
had left behind it ; namely, the blood, the bones, and part of the 
flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoured by those wretches with 
merriment and sport. 

I was so filled with indignation at the sight, that I now began to 
premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw there, let them 
be whom or how many soever. It seemed evident to me that the 
Visits which they made thus to this island were not very frequent, 
for it was above fifteen months before any more of them came on 
shore there again, — that is to say, I neither saw them nor any 
footsteps or signals of them in all that time ; for as to the rainy 
seasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at least not so far. 
Yet all this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the constant 
apprehensions I was in of their Coming upon me by surprise ; 
whence I observe that the expectation of evil is more bitter than 
the suffering, especially if there is no room to shake off that 
expectation, or those apprehensions. 

I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of mind, 
expecting that I should one day or other.fall into the hands of 
these merciless creatures. If I did at any time venture abroad, it 



i66 

was not without looking around me with the greatest care and 
caution imaginable. And now I found, to my great comfort, how 
happy it was that I had provided a tarne flock, or herd, of goats, 
for I durst not upon any account fire my gun, especially near that 
side of the Island where they usually came, lest I should alarm the 
savages ; and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have 
them come again, with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with 
them, in a few days, and then I knew what to expect. 

I slept unquietly, dreamed always frightful dreams, and often 
Started out of my sleep in the night. In the day, great troubles 
overwhelmed my mind ; and in the night, I dreamed often of killing 
the savages, and of the reasons why I might justify the doing of it. 

It was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth day, I think, as 
well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon, — for I marked all 
upon the post still ; — I say, it was on the sixteenth of May that it 
blew a very great storm of wind all day, with a great deal of light- 
ning and thunder, and a very foul night it was after it. I knew not 
what was the particular occasion of it ; but as I was reading in the 
Bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts about my present 
condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I thought, fired 
at sea. This was, to be sure, a surprise quite of a different nature 
from any I had met with before ; for the notions this put into my 
thoughts were quite of another kind. I started up in the greatest 
haste imaginable ; and, in a trice, clapped my ladder to the middle 
place of the rock, and puUed it after me ; and mounting it the 
second time, got to the top of the hill the very moment that a flash 
of fire bid me listen for a second gun, which, accordingly, in about 
half a minute, I heard. By the sound I knew that it was from that 
part of the sea where I was driven down the current in my boat. 

I immediately considered that this must be some ship in distress, 
and that they had some comrade, or some other ship in Company, 
and fired these for signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had 
the presence of mind, at that minute, to think that though I could 
not help them, it might be they might help me. So I brought to- 
gether all the dry wood I could get at band, and, making a good. 



i67 

handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the hill. The wood was dry, 
and blazed freely; and, though the wind blew very hard, yet it 
burned fairly out. I was certain, if there was any such thing as a 
ship, they must see it. And no doubt they did ; for as soon as 
ever my fire blazed up, I heard another gun, and after that several 
others, all from the same quarter. I plied my fire all night long 
tili daybreak. 

When it was broad day, and the air cleared up, I saw something 
at a great distance at sea, fiill east of the island, whether a sail or 
a hüll I could not distinguish — no, not with my glass ; the distance 
was so great, and the weather still something hazy also. 

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that 
it was a ship at anchor ; and being eager, you may be sure, to 
be satisfied, I took my gun in my band, and ran towards the south 
side of the island, to the rocks where I had formerly been carried 
away by the current. Getting up there, the weather by this time 
being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sorrow, the 
wreck of a ship, cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks 
which I found when I was out in my boat ; and which rocks, as 
they checked the violence of the stream, were the occasion of my 
recovering from the most desperate, hopeless condition that ever 
I had been in in all my life. Thus, what is one man's safety is 
another man's destruction ; for it seems these men, whoever they 
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks being wholly 
ander water, had been driven upon them in the night, the wind 
blowing hard at east-northeast. Had they seen the island, as I 
must necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, 
have endeavored to have saved themselves on shore by the help 
of their boat. 

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my 
boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might find something on 
board that might be useful to me. But that did not altogether 
press me so much as the possibility that there might be yet some 
living creature on board, whose life I might not only save, but 
might, by saving that life, comfort my own to the last degree. 



i68 

This thought so clung to my heart that I could not be. quiet night 
or day, but I must venture out in my boat on board this wreck ; 
and committing the rest to God*s providence, I thought the im- 
pression was so strong upon my mind that it could not be resisted, 
— that it must come from some invisible direction, and that I 
should be wanting to myself if I did not go. 

Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my 
Castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, 
a great pot of fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum 
(for I had still a great deal of that left) , and a basket of raisins ; 
and thus loading myself with everything necessary, I went down 
to my boat, got the water out of her, got her afloat, loaded all my 
cargo in her, and then went home again for more. My second 
cargo was a great bag of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head 
for a shade, another large pot of fresh water, and about two dozen 
of small loaves, or barley cakes, more than before, with a bottle of 
goat's milk, and a cheese. 

All this with great labor and sweat I carried to my boat ; and 
praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out, and rowing or pad- 
dling the canoe along the shore, came at last to the utmost point 
of the island on the northeast side. And now I was to launch out 
into the ocean, and either to venture or not to venture. I looked 
on the rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides of the 
island at a distance, and which were very terrible to me, from the 
remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my heart 
began to fail me. I foresaw that if I was driven into either of 
those currents, I should be carried a great way out to sea, and 
perhaps out of my reach, or sight of the island again ; and that 
then, as my boat was but small, if any little gale of wind should 
rise, I should be inevitably lost. 

I first made a little out to sea, füll north, tili I began to feel the 
benefit of the current, which set eastward, and which carried me 
at a great rate, and yet did not so hurry me as the current on the 
south side had done before, so as to take from me all government 
of the boat. Having a strong steerage with my paddle, I went at 



169 

a great rate directly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I 
came up to it. It was a dismal sight to look at. The ship, which, 
by its building, was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two 
rocks. When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon her, who, 
seeing me Coming, yelped and cried, and, as soon as I called him, 
jumped into the sea to come to me. I took him into the boat, 
btit found him almost dead with hunger and thirst. I gave him a 
cake of my bread, and he devoured it like a ravenous wolf that 
had been starving a fortnight in the snow. I then gave the poor 
creature some fresh water, with which, if I would have let him, he 
would have burst himself. After this I went on board ; but the 
first sight I met with was two men drowned in the cookroom, or 
forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about one another. I 
concluded, as is indeed probable, that when the ship Struck, it 
being in a storm, the sea broke so high and so continually over 
her that the men were not able to bear it, and were strangled with 
the constant rushing in of the water, as much as if they had been 
under water. 

Besides the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that had Hfe ; 
nor any goods, that I could see, but what were spoiled by the water. 
I saw several chests, which, I believe, belonged to some of the sea- 
men ; and I got two of them into the boat, without examining what 
was in them. 

I found, besides these chests, a little cask füll of liquor, of about 
twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much difficulty. I 
took a fire shovel and tongs, which I wanted extremely ; as also 
two little brass kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a 
gridiron ; and with this cargo, and the dog, I came away, the tide 
beginning to make home again. The same evening, about an hour 
within night, I reached the island again, weary and fatigued to the 
last degree. I reposed that night in the boat ; and in the moming 
I resolved to harbor what I had got in my new cave, and not to 
carry it home to my Castle. When I came to open the chests, I 
found several things of great use to me. For example, I found 
in one a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled 



I/o 

with cordial waters, fine and very good. The bottles held about 
three pints each, and were tipped with silver. I found two pots 
of very good succades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on the top 
that the salt water had not hurt them ; and two more of the same, 
which the water had spoiled. I found some very good Shirts, which 
were very welcome to me ; and about a dozen and a half of white 
linen handkerchiefs and colored neckcloths. The former were also 
very welcome, being exceedingly refreshing to wipe my face in a 
hot day. Besides this, when I came to the tili in the ehest, I 
found there three great bags of pieces of eight, which held about 
eleven hundred pieces in all ; and in one of them, wrapped up in 
a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small bars or wedges of 
gold ; I suppose they might all weigh near a pound. 

Upon the whole, I got very little by this voyage that was of any 
use to me ; for, as to the money, I had no manner of occasion for 
it ; it was to me as the dirt under my feet, and I would have given 
it all for three or four pair of English shoes and stockings, which 
were things I greatly wanted, but had had none on my feet for 
many years. 

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured them, 
I went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the 
shore to her old harbor, where I laid her up, and made the best 
of my way to my old habitation, where I found everything safe 
and quiet. I began now to repose myself, live after my old fashion, 
and take care of my family affairs. For a while I lived easy enough, 
only that I was more vigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, 
and did not go abroad so much. If at any time I did stir with 
any freedom, it was always to the east part of the island, where I 
was pretty well satisfied the savages never came, and where I could 
go without so many precautions and such a load of arms and am- 
munition as I always carried with me if I went the other way. I 
lived in this condition near two years more ; but my unlucky head, 
that was always to let me know it was bom to make my body 
miserable, was all these two years filled with projects and designs, 
how, if it were possible, I might get away from this island. 



171 



CHAPTER XXXIII. 

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the four- 
and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of solitude. 
I was lying in my bed or hammock, awake, and very well in health ; 
I had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, nor any un- 
easiness of mind more than ordinary, but could by no means close 
my eyes, — that is, so as to sleep, — no, not a wink. I ran over 
the whole history of my life in mihiature, or by abridgment, as I 
may call it, to my coming to this island, and also of that part of 
my life since I came to this island. 

In my reflections upon the State of my case since I came on shore 
on this island, I was comparing the happy posture of my affairs in 
the first years of my habitation here, with the life of anxiety, fear, 
and care, which I had lived in ever since I had seen the print of a 
foot in the sand. Not that I did not beheve the savages had fre- 
quented the island even all the while, and might have been several 
hundreds of them at times on shore there ; but I had never known 
it, and was incapable of any apprehensions about it. I had walked 
about in the greatest security, and with all possible tranquillity, 
even when perhaps nothing but the brow of a hill, a great tree, or 
the casual approach of night, had been between me and the worst 
kind of destruction ; namely, that of falling into the hands of can- 
nibals and savages, who would have seized on me with the same 
view as I would on a goat or turtle ; and would have thought it no 
more crime to kill and devour me, than I did of a pigeon or a 
curlew. I would unjustly slander myself if I should say I was not 
sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular protec- 
tion I acknowledged, with great humility, all these unknown ddiv- 
erances were due, and without which I must inevitably have fallen 
into their merciless hands. 

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time 
taken up in considering what part of the world these wretches lived 
in ; how far off the coast was from whence they came ; what they 



172 

ventured over so far from home for; what kind of boats they 
had ; and why I might not order myself and my business so that 
I might be as able to go over thither as they were to come to me. 
Perhaps I might fall in with sorae Christian ship that might take 
me in ; and, if the worst came to the worst, I could but die, which 
would put an end to all these miseries at once. 

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, 
with such violence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and 
my pulse beat as if I had been in a fever, merely with the ex- 
traordinary fervor of my mind'about it, nature — as if I had been 
fatigued and exhausted with the very thoughts of it — threw me 
into a sound sleep. One would have thought I should have 
dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything relating to it. But 
I dreamed that as I was going out in the morning as usual, from 
my Castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages, 
Coming to land, and that they brought with them another savage, 
whom they were going to kill in order to eat him ; when, on a 
sudden, the savage that they were going to kill jumped away, and 
ran for his life. And I thought, in my sleep, that he came run- 
ning into my little thick grove before my fortification, to hide 
himself ; and that I, seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the 
others sought him that way, showed myself to him, and smiling 
upon him, encouraged him. He kneeled down to me, seeming to 
pray me to assist him ; upon which I showed him my ladder, made 
him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he became my ser- 
vant. As soon as I had got this man, I said to myself, " Now I 
may certainly venture to the mainland, for this fellow will serve 
me as a pilot and will teil me what to do, and whither to go for 
provisions, and whither not to go for fear of being devoured ; what 
places to venture into, and what to shun." I awoke with this 
thought ; and was under such inexpressible impressions of joy at 
the prospect of my escape in my dream, that the disappointments 
which I feit upon coming to myself, and finding that it was no more 
than a dream, were equally extravagant the other way, and threw 
me into a very great dejection of spirits. 



173 

Upon this, however, I raade this conclusion : that my only way 
to go about to attempt an escape was to endeavor to get a savage 
into my possession. If possible, it should be one of their pris- 
oners, whom they had condemned to be eaten, and should bring 
hither to kill. 

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the 
scout as often as possible, and indeed so often that I was heartily 
tired of it. I went out to the west end, and to the southwest 
Corner of the island almost every day, to look for canoes, but none 
appeared. The longer they seemed to be delayed, the more eager 
I was for them. In a word, I was not at first so careful to shun 
the sight of these savages, and avoid being seen by them, as I was 
now eager to be upon them. Besides, I fencied myself able to 
manage one, nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to 
make them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct 
them, and to prevent their being able at any time to do me any 
hurt. It was a great while that I pleased myself with this affair ; 
but nothing still presented itself. All my fancies and schemes came 
to nothing, for no savages came near me for a great while. 

About a year and a half after I had entertained these notions, I 
was surprised one moming early by seeing no less than five canoes 
all on shore together on my side the island, and the people who 
belonged to them all landed and out of my sight. The number of 
them broke all my measures ; for seeing so many, and knowing 
that they always came four or six, or sometimes more, in a boat, I 
could not teil what to think of it, or how to take my measures to 
attack twenty or thirty men single-handed. So I lay still in my 
Castle, perplexed and discomforted. However, I put myself into 
the same position for an attack that I had formerly provided, and 
was just ready for action, if anything had presented. 

Having waited a good while, listening to hear if they made ahy 
noise, at length, being very impatient, I set my guns at the foot of 
my ladder, and clambered up to the top of the hill, by my two 
stages, as usual; Standing so, however, that my head did not 
appear above the hill, so that they could not perceive me by any 



174 

means. Here I observed, by the help of my perspective glass, 
that they were no less than thirty in number ; that they had a fire 
kindled, and that they had meat dressed. How they had cooked 
it, I knew not, or what it was ; but they were all dancing, in I know 
not how many barbarous gestures and figures, their own way, round 
the fire. 

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my perspec- 
tive glass, two miserable wretches dragged from the boats, where, 
it seems, they were laid by, and were now brought out for the 
slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately fall, being 
knocked down, I suppose, with a club, or wooden sword, for that 
was their way ; and two or three others were at work immediately, 
cutting him open for their cookery, while the other victim was left 
Standing by himself, tili they should be ready for him. In that 
very moment, this poor wretch, seeing himself a little at liberty, 
and unbound, Nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he 
Started away from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along 
the sands, directly towards me ; I mean, towards that part of the 
coast where my habitation was. I was dreadfully frightened, I 
must acknowledge, when I perceived him run my way ; and espe- 
cially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by the whole body. 
I expected that part of my dream was Coming to pass, and that he 
would certainly take shelter in my grove ; but I could not depend, 
by any means, upon my dream, that the other savages would not 
pursue him thither, and find him there. However, I kept my Sta- 
tion, and my spirits began to recover when I found that there were 
not above three men that foUowed him. Still more was I encour- 
aged, when I found that he outstripped them exceedingly in run- 
ning, and gained ground on them ; so that if he could but hold out 
for half an hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away fi*om them all. 

There was between them and my Castle, the creek, which I men- 
tioned often in the first part of my story, where I landed my car- 
goes out of the ship. This I saw plainly he must necessarily swim 
over, or the poor wretch would be taken there. But when the 
savage escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though the 



175 

tide was then up ; but, plunging in, swam through in about thirty 
strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran with exceeding strength 
and swiftness. When the three persons came to the creek, I 
found that two of them could swim, but the third could not, and 
that, Standing on the other side, he looked at the others, but went 
no farther, and soon after went softly back again ; which, as it hap- 
pened, was very well for him in the end. I observed that the two 
who swam were yet more than twice as long swimming over the 
creek as the fellow was that fled from them. It came very warmly 
upon ray thoug:hts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was the time 
to get me a servant, and perhaps a companion or assistant ; and 
that I was plainly called by Providence to save this poor creature's 
life. 

I immediately ran down the ladders with all possible expedition, 
fetched my two guns, for they were both at the foot of the ladders, 
as I observed before, and getting up again with the same haste to 
the top of the hill, I crossed towards the sea. Having a /ery 
Short cut, and all down hill, I placed myself in the way bet veen 
the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, 
who, looking back, was at first perhaps as much frightened at me 
as at them. But I beckoned with my band to him to come back ; 
and, in the mean time, I slowly advanced towards the two that 
foUowed. Then rushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked 
hiin down with the stock of my piece. I was loath to fire, because 
I would not have the rest hear ; though, at that distance, it would 
not have been easily heard, and being out of sight of the smoke, too, 
they would not have known what to make of it. Having knocked 
this fellow down, the other who pursued with him stopped, as if he 
had been frightened, and I advanced quickly towards him ; but as 
I came nearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and 
was fitting it to shoot at me. So I was then obliged to shoot at 
him first, which I did, and killed him at the first shot. The poor 
savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw both his enemies 
fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was so frightened with the fire 
and noise of my piece that he stood stock-still, and neither came 



1/6 

forward, nor went backward, though he seemed rather inclined 
still to üy than to come on. I hallooed again to him, and made 
signs to come forward, which he easily understood, and came a 




little way ; then stopped again, and then a little farther, and stopped 
again. I could then perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had 
been taken prisoner, and were just about to be killed as his two 
enemies had been. I beckoned to him again to come to rae, and 



177 

gave him all the signs of encouragement that I could think of. 
He came nearer aiid nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve 
Steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled 
at him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still 
nearer. At length he came close to me ; and then he kneeled 
down again, kissed the groundj and laid his head upon the ground, 
and, taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head. This, it 
seems, was in token of swearing to be my slave forever. • 

I took him up and made much of him, and encouraged him all 
I could. But there was more work to do yet ; for I perceived the 
savage whom I had knocked down was not killed, but stunned 
with the blow, and began to come to himself. So I pointed to 
him, and showed him the savage, that he was not dead. Upon 
this he spoke some words to me, and though I could not under- 
stand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear ; for they 
were the first sound of a man's voice that I had heard, my own 
excepted, for above twenty-five years. 

But there was no time for such reflections now. The savage 
who was knocked down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon 
the ground, and I perceived that my savage began to be afraid. 
But when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the man, as 
if I would shoot him. Upon this, my savage, — for so I call him 
now, — made a motion to me to lend him my sword, which hung 
naked in a belt by my side ; which I did. He no sooner had it, 
but he ran to his enemy, and at one blow cut off his head so 
cleverly, no executioner in Germany could haye done it sooner or 
better ; which I thought very stränge for one who, I had reason to 
believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except their own 
wooden swords. However, it seems, as I learned afterwards, they 
make their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so 
hard, that they will even cut off heads with them, — ay, and arms, 
and that at one blow, too. When he had done this, he came laugh- 
ing to me in sign of triumph, and brought me the sword again, and, 
with abundance of gestures which I did not understand, laid it down, 
with the head of the savage that he had killed, just before me. 



178 

But that which astonished him most was to know how I killed 
the other Indian so far off. Pointing to him, he made signs to 
me to let him go to him ; and I bade him go, as well as I could. 
When he came to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at him, 
tuming him first on one side, then on the other; looked at the 
wound the bullet had made, which it seems was just in his breast, 
where it had made a hole, and no great quantity of blood had 
followed, but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead. He 
took up his bow and arrows, and came back. I turned to go away, 
and beckoned him to foUow me, making signs to him that more 
might come after them. lipon this he made signs to me that he 
should bury them with sand, that they might not be seen by the 
rest, if they followed. I made signs to him again to do so. He 
feil to work ; and in an instant he had scraped a hole in the sand 
with his hands, big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged 
him into it, and covered him. He did so by the other also ; I 
believe he had buried them both in a quarter of an hour. Theo, 
calling him away, I carried him, not to my castle, but quite away 
to my cave, on the farther part of the island ; so I did not let my 
dream come to pass in that part, that he came into my grove for 
shelter. Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, 
and a draught of water, which I found he was indeed in great dis- 
tress for, from his running. Having refreshed him, I made signs 
for him to go and lie down to sleep, showing him a place where I 
had laid some rice straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used 
to sleep upon myself sometimes. So the poor creature lay down, 
and went to sleep. 



CHAPTER XXXIV. 

He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with 
straight, strong limbs ; not too large, tall and well shaped, and, as I 
reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had a very good coun- 
tenance, not a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have some- 



179 

thing very manly in his face ; and yet he had all the sweetness and 
softness of a European in his countenance too, especially when he 
smiled. His hair was long and black, not curled like wool, his 
forehead very high and large, and a great vivacity and sparkling 
sharpness in his eyes. The color of his skin was not quite black, 
but very tawny ; and yet not an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as 
the Brazilians and Virginians, and other natives of America are, 
but of a bright kind of a dun olive-color, that had in it some- 
thing very agreeable, though not very easy to describe. His face 
was round and plump ; his nose small, not flat like the negroes ; a 
very good mouth, thin Ups, and his fine teeth well set, and as white 
as ivory. 

After he had slept about half an hour, he awoke again, and came 
out of the cave to me. I had been milking my goats, which I had 
in the inclosure just by. When he espied me, he came running to 
me, laying himself down again upon the ground, with all the possi- 
ble signs of a humble, thankful disposition, making a great many 
antic gestures to show it. At last he laid his head flat upon the 
ground, close to my foot, and set my other foot upon his head, as 
he had done before. After this, he made all the signs to me of sub- 
jection, servitude, and Submission imaginable, to let me know how 
he would serve me so long as he lived. I understood him in many 
things, and let him know I was very well pleased with him. In a 
little time I began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me ; 
and, first, I let him know his name should be Frtoay, which 
was the day I saved his life. I called him so for the memory of 
the time. I likewise taught him to say " Master ; " and then let 
him know that was to be my name. I likewise taught him to say 
" yes " and " no," and to know the meaning of them. I gave him 
some milk in an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before 
him, and sop my bread in it ; and gave him a cake of bread to do 
the like, which he quickly complied with, and made signs that it 
was very good for him. 

I kept there with him all that night ; but, as soon as it was day, 
I beckoned to him to come with me, and let him know I would 



i8o 

give him some clothes. As we went by the place where he had 
buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the place, and showed 
me the marks that he häd made to find them again, making signs 
to me that we should dig them up again and eat them. At this, 
I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it, made as 
if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my 
hand to him to come away, which he did immediately, with great 
Submission. I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if 
his enemies were gone. PuUing out my glass, I looked, and saw 
plainly the place where they had been, but no appearance of them 
or their canoes ; so that it was piain they were gone, and had left 
their two comrades behind them, without any search after them. 

But I was not content with this discovery; but having now 
more courage, and consequently more curiosity, I took my man 
Friday with me, giving him the sword in his hand, with the bow 
and arrows at his back, which I found he could use very dexter- 
ously, making him carry one gun for me, and I two for myself ; and 
away we marched to the place where these creatures had been ; 
for I had a mind now to get some fuller intelligence of them. 
When I came to the place, my very blood ran chill in my veins, 
and my heart sank within me, at the horror of the spectacle. 
Indeed, it was a dreadful sight, — at least it was so to me, though 
Friday made nothing of it. The place was covered with human 
bones, and the ground dyed with their blood. Friday, by his 
signs, made me understand that they brought over four prisoners 
to feast upon ; that three of them were eaten up, and that he, 
pointing to himself, was the fourth ; that there had been a great 
battle between them and their next king, of whose subjects, it 
seems, he had been one, and that they had taken a great number 
of prisoners ; äU which were carried to several places, by those 
who had taken them in the fight, in order to feast upon them, 
as was done here by these wretches upon those they brought 
hither. 

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and what- 
ever remained, and lay them together in a heap, and make a great 



i8i 

fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had still 
a hankering stomach after some of the flesh, and was still a canni- 
bal in bis nature ; but I showed so much abhorrence at the very 
thoughts of it, and at the least appearance of it, that he durst not 
discover it ; for I had, by some means, let hira know that I would 
kill him if he offered it. 

When he had done this, we came back to our Castle, and there 
I feil to work for my man Friday. First of all, I gave him a pair 
of linen breeches, which I had out of the poor gunner's ehest I 
mentioned, which I found in the wreck, and which, with a little 
alteration, fitted him very well ; and then I made him a jerkin of 
goat's skin, as well as my skill would allow (for I was now grown 
a tolerably good tailor); and I gave him a cap which I made 
of hare*s skin, very convenient, and fashionable enough. Thus 
he was clothed, for the present, tolerably well, and was mighty 
well pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as his master. 
It is true, he went awkwardly in these clothes at first. Wearing 
the breeches was very avvkward to him, and the sleeves of the 
waistcoat galled his Shoulders and the inside of his arms ; but with 
a little easing them where he complained they hurt him, and using 
himself to them, he took to them at length very well. 

The next day after I came home to my hut with him, I began 
to consider where I should lodge him ; and, that I might do well 
for him and yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for 
him in the vacant place between my two fortifications, in the 
inside of the last, and in the outside of the first. As there was 
a door or entrance there into my cave, I made a framed door- 
case, and a door to it of boards, and set it up in the passage, 
a little within the entrance ; and, causing the door to open in the 
inside, I barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders, too. So 
Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my innermost 
wall, without making so much noise in getting over that it must 
needs awaken me ; for my first wall had now a complete roof over 
it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the side of 
the hin ; which was again laid across with smaller sticks instead 



l82 

of laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with the rice 
straw, which was strong, like reeds. At the hole or place which 
was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap- 
door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside, would not 
have opened at all, but would have fallen down and made a great 
noise. As to weapons, I took them all into my side every night. 

But I needed none of all this precaution ; for never man had a 
more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me. He 
was without passions, suUenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and 
engaged. His very affections were tied to me like those of a 
child to a father ; and I dare say he would have sacrificed his life 
to save mine, upon any occasion whatsoever. The many testi- 
monies he gave me of this put it out of doubt, and soon convinced 
me that I needed to use no precautions for my safety on his 
account. 

I was greatly delighted with him, and made it my business to 
teach him everything that was proper to make him useful, handy, 
and helpful ; but especially to make him speak, and understand 
me when I spoke. And he was the aptest scholar that ever was ; 
and particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased 
when he could but understand me, or make me understand him, 
that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him. Now my life 
began to be so easy that I began to say to myself that could 
I but have been safe from more savages, I cared not if I was 
never to remove from the place while I lived. 



CHAFfER XXXV. 

After I had been two or three days returned to my Castle, I 
thought that, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way of 
feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to 
let him taste other flesh ; so I took him out with me one morning 
to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid out of my 
own üock, and bring it home and dress it ; but as I was going, I 



i83 

saw a she-goat l5nng down in the shade, and two young kids sitting 
by her. I caiight hold of Friday. " Hold," said I, " stand still ; " 
and made signs to him not to stir. Immediately, I presented ray 
piece, shot, and killed one of the kids. The poor creature, who 
had, at a distance, indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but 
did not know, nor could imagine, how it was done, was sensibly 
surprised ; he trembled, and shook, and looked so amazed that I 
thought he would have sunk down. He did not see the kid I 
shot at, or perceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat, 
to feel whether he was not wounded ; and, as I found presently, 
thought I was resolved to kill him. He came and kneeled down 
to me, and embracing my knees, said a great many things I did 
not understand ; but I could easily see the meaning was to pray 
me not to kill him. 

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no 
härm. Taking him up by the band, I laughed at him, and point- 
ing to the kid which I had killed, I beckoned to him to run and 
fetch it, which he did. While he was wondering, and looking to 
see how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun again. By and 
by I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sitting upon a tree within shot. 
To let Friday understand a little what I would do, I called him to 
me again, pointed at the fowl, — which was indeed a parrot, though 
I thought it had been a hawk, — I say, pointing to the parrot, and 
to my gun, and to the ground under the parrot, to let him see I 
would make it fall, I made him understand that I would shoot 
and kill that bird. Accordingly I fired, and bade him look, and 
immediately he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one frightened 
again, notwithstanding all I had said to him. I found he was the 
more amazed because he did not see me put anything into the gun, 
but thought that there must be some wonderful fund of death and 
destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or anything 
near or far off; and the astonishment this created in him was such 
as could not wear off for a long time. I believe, if I would have 
let him, he would have worshiped me and my gun. As for the 
gun itself, he would not so much as touch it for several days after ; 



i84 

but he would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him, 
when he was by himself ; which, as I afterwards learned of him, 
was to desire it not to kill him. 

Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed. 
to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but 
stayed some time; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had 
fluttered away a good distance from the place where she feil. 
However, he found her, took her up, and brought her to me ; and 
as I had perceived his ignorance about the gun before, I took this 
advantage to charge the gun again, and not to let him see me do 
it, that I might be ready for any other mark that might present. 
But nothing more offered at that time; so I brought home the 
kid, and the same evening I took the skin off, and cut it out as 
well as I could ; and having a pot fit for that purpose, I boiled or 
stewed some of the flesh, and made some very good broth. After 
I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my man, who secmed 
very glad of it, and liked it very well ; but that which was strängest 
to him was to see nie eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that 
the salt was not good to eat ; and putting a little into his own 
mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, 
washing his mouth with fresh water after it. On the other band, 
I took some meat into my mouth without salt, and I pretended to 
spit and sputter for want of salt, as much as he had done at the 
salt. But it would not do ; he would never care for salt with meat 
or in his broth ; at least, not for a great while, and then but a very 
little. 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was re- 
solved to feast him the next day by roasting a piece of the kid. 
This I did by hanging it before the fire on a string, as I had seen 
many people do in England, setting two poles up, one on each 
side of the fire, and one across the top, and tying the string to 
the cross stick, letting the meat turn continually. This Friday 
admired very much; but when he came to taste the flesh, he 
took so many ways to teil me how well he liked it, that I could 
not but understand him. At last he told me, as well as he could. 



.85 

he would never eat man 's flesh any more, which I was very glad 
to hear. 

The next day, I set him to work beating some corn out, and 
sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I observed before. He soon 
understood how to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen 
what the meaning of it was, and that it was to make bread of. 
After that, I let him see me make my bread, and bake it, too ; and 
in a little time, Friday was able to do all the work for me, as well 
as I could do it myself. 

I began now to consider that, having two mouths to feed in- 
stead of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and 
plant a larger quantity of com than I used to do. So I marked 
out a larger piece of land, and began the fence in the same man- 
ner as before, in which Friday not bnly worked very willingly and 
very hard, but did it very cheerfully. I told him what it was for, — 
that it was for corn to make more bread, because he was now with 
me, and that I might have enough for him and myself too. He 
appeared very sensible of that part, and let me know that he 
thought I had much more labor upon me on his account than I 
had for myself; and that he would work the harder for me, if I 
would teil him what to do. 

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place. 
Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of 
almost everything I had occasion to call for, and of every place I 
had to send him to, and talked a great deal to me ; so that, in 
Short, I began now to have some use for my tongue again, which, 
indeed, I had very little occasion for before. Besides the pleasure 
of talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the fellow him- 
self. His simple, unfeigned. honesty appeared to me more and 
more every day, and I began really to love the creature ; and on 
his side, I believe he loved me more than it was possible for him 
ever to love anything before. 

I had a mind once to try if he had any inclination for his own 
country again ; and having taught him English so well that he 
could answer me almost any question, I asked him whether the 



i86 

nation that he belonged to never conquered in battle ; at which 
he smiled, and said, " Yes, yes, we always fight the better ; " that 
is, he meant, always get the better in fight ; and so we began the 
foUowing discourse : 

Master, — You always fight the better ! How came you to be 
taken prisoner then, Friday? 

Friday, — My nation beat much for all that. 

Master, — How beat? If your nation beat them, how came 
you to be taken? 

Friday, — They more many than my nation, in the place where 
me was ; they take one, two, three, and me. My nation over-beat 
them in the yonder place, where me no was ; there my nation take 
one, two, great thousand. 

Master, — But why did not your side recover you from the 
hands of your enemies then? 

Friday, — They run, one, two, three, and me, and make go in 
the canoe ; my nation have no canoe that time. 

Master, — Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with 
the men they take ? Do they carry them away and eat them, as 
these did ? 

Friday, — Yes, my nation eat mans too ; eat all up. 

Master, — Where do thdy carry them ? 

Friday, — Go to other place, where they think. 

Master, — Do they come hither? 

Friday, — Yes, yes, they come hither ; come other eise place. 

Master, — Have you been here with them ? 

Friday, — Yes, I been here. (Points to the northwest side of 
the island, which, it seems, was their side.) 

By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly been 
among the savages who used to come on shore on the farther part 
of the island, on the same man-eating occasions he was now 
brought for. Some time after, when I took the courage to carry 
him to that side, being the same I formerly mentioned, he pres- 
ently knew the place, and told me he was there once when they 
ate up twenty men, two women, and one child. He could not 



i87 

teil twenty in English, but he numbered theni by laying so many 
stones in a row, and pointing to me to teil them over. 

I asked him how far it was from our island to the shore, and 
whether the canoes were not often lost. He told me there was 
no danger, no canoes ever lost ; but that, after a little way out to 
sea, there was a current and wind, always one way in the morning, 
the other in the aftemoon. This I understood to be no more 
than the sets of the tide, as going out or Coming in. But I after- 
wards imderstood it was occasioned by the great draft and reflux 
of the mighty river Orinoco, in the mouth of which river, as I 
found afterwards, our island lay ; and that this land which I per- 
ceived to be west and northwest, was the great island Trinidad,^ 
on the north point of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday a 
thousand questions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, 
the coast, and what nations were near. He told me all he knew, 
with the greatest openness imaginable. I asked him the names 
of the several nations of his sort of people, but could get no other 
name than Caribs. I easily understood that these were the 
Caribbees, which our maps place on the part of America which 
reaches from the mouth of the river Orinoco to Guiana, and on- 
wards to St. Martha. He told me that up a great way beyond 
the moon, — that is, beyond the setting of the moon, which must 
be west from their country, — there dwelt white, bearded men hke 
me, — and pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned be- 
fore, — and that they had killed " much mans," — that was his word. 
By all which I understood he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties 
in America had been spread over the whole country, and were 
remembered by all the nations from father to son. 

I inquired if he could teil me how I might go from this island, 
and get among those white men. He told me, " Yes, yes, you 
may go in two canoe." I could not understand what he meant, or 
make him describe to me what he meant by ** two canoe," tili at 
last, with great difficulty, I found he meant it must be in a large 
boat, as big as two canoes. This part of Friday*s discourse I

i88 

began to relish very well ; and from this time I entertained some 
hopes that, one time or other, I might find an opportunity to 
make my escape from this place, and that this poor savage might 
be a means to help me. 



CHAPTER XXXVI. 

DuRiNG the long time that Friday had now been with me, and 
that he began to speak to me, and understand me, I was not want- 
ing in laying a foundation of religious knowledge in his mind ; 
particularly I asked him, one time, who made him. The poor 
creature did not understand me at all, but thought I had asked 
who was his father ; but I took it up by another handle, and asked 
him who made the sea, the ground we walked on, and the hills 
and woods. He told me it was one old Benamuckee, that lived 
beyond all. He could describe nothing of this great person but 
that he was very old, — much older, he said, than the sea or land, 
than the moon or the stars. I asked him, then, if this old person 
had made all things, why all things did not worship him. He looked 
very grave, and, with a perfect look of innocence, said, " All things 
say O to him." I asked him if the people who died in his country 
went away anywhere. He said yes, they all went to Benamuckee. 
Then I asked him whether those they ate went up thither too. 
He said, "Yes." 

From these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge 
of the true God. I told him that the great Maker of all things 
lived up there (pointing up towards heaven) ; that he governed 
the World by the same power and providence by which he made 
it; that he was omnipotent, and could do everything for us, 
give everything to us, take everything from us. Thus, by de- 
grees, I opened his eyes. He heard with great attention of 
Jesus Christ, and of the manner of making our prayers to God, 
and his being able to hear us, even in heaven. He told me one 
day that if our God could hear us, up beyond the sun, he must 



i89 

needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee, wHq lived but 
a little way off^ and yet could not hear tili they went up to the 
great mountains where he dwelt to speak to him. I asked him 
if ever he went thither to speak to him. He said no, they never 
went that were young men ; none went thither but the old men, 
whom he called their " Oowokakee ; " that is, as I made him 
explain to me, their religious, or clergy ; and that they went to 
say " O " (so he called saying prayers), and then came back and 
told them what Benamuckee said. By this I observed that there 
is priestcraft even among the most blinded, ignorant pagans in 
the World. 

I diverted the present discourse between me and my man by 
sending him for something a good way off. I then seriously prayed 
to God that he would enable me to instruct this poor savage, assist- 
ing, by his Spirit, the heart of the poor, ignorant creature to receive 
the light of the knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling him to him- 
self, and would guide me so to speak to him from the Word of God 
that his conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened, and his 
soul saved. When he came again to me, I entered into a long 
discourse with him upon the subject of the redemption of man by 
the Savior of the world, and of the doctrine of the gospel preached 
from heaven ; namely, of repentance towards God, and faith in our 
blessed Lord Jesus. 

I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the 
methods I took for this poor creature's instruction, and must ac- 
knowledge — what I believe all that act upon the same principle 
will find — that in laying Things open to him, I really informed and 
instructed myself in many things that either I did not know, or had 
not fully considered before, but which occurred naturally to my 
mind upon searching into them for the information of this poor 
savage. I had more affection in my inquiry after things upon this 
occasion than ever I feit before. Whether this poor, wild wretch 
was the better for me or no, I had great reason to be thankful that 
ever he came to me ; my grief sat lighter upon me, my habita- 
tion grew comfortable to me beyond measure, and I frequently re- 



joiced that ever I was brought to this place, which I had so often 
thought the most dreadful of all afüictions that could possibly have 
befallen me. 

I continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my time ; 
and the conversation which employed the hours between Friday 
and me was such as made the three years which we lived there to- 
gether perfectly and completely happy, if any such thing as com- 
plete happiness can be found in a sublunary State. This savage 
was now a good Christian, a much better than I ; though I have 
reason to hope, and bless God for it, that we were equally penitent, 
and comforted, restored penitents. We had here the Word of Ck)d 
to read, and were no farther off from his Spirit to instruct than if 
we had been in England. I always applied myself, in reading the 
Scripture, to let him know, as well as I could, the meaning of 
what I read. 

After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and he 
could understand almost all I said to him, and speak pretty fluently, 
though in broken English, to me, I acquainted him with my own 
history, or at least so much of it as related to my Coming to this 
place ; how I had lived there, and how long. I let him into the 
mystery — for such^it was to him — of gunpowder and bullet, and 
taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife, which he was won- 
derfully delighted with ; and I made him a belt, with a frog hang- 
ing to it, such as in England we wear hangers in ; and in the frog, 
instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only as 
good a weapon in some cases, but much more useful upon other 
occasions. 

I described to him the countries of Europe, particularly England, 
which I came from ; how we lived, how we worshiped God, how 
we behaved to one another, and how we traded in ships to all parts 
of the World. I gave him an account of the wreck which I had 
been on board of, and showed him, as near as I could, the place 
where she lay. She was all beaten in pieces before, and gone. 
I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we 
escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole strength then. 



191 

but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, 
Friday stood musing a great while, and said nothing. I asked 
him what it was he studied upon. At last he said, " Me see such 
boat like come to place at my nation." I did not understand 
him a good while ; but at last, when I had examined further into it, 
I understood by him that a boat such as that had been, came on 
shore upon the country where he lived ; that is, as he explained it, 
was driven thither by stress of weather. I presently imagined that 
some European ship must have been cast away upon their coast, 
and the boat might get loose and drive ashore ; but was so dull that 
I never once thought of men making their escape from a wreck 
thither, much less whence they might come. 

Friday described the boat to me well enough ; but brought me 
better to understand him when he added with some warmth, " We 
save the white mans from drown. " *? hen I presently asked if there 
were any "white mans," as he called them, in the boat. " Yes," 
he said ; " the boat füll of white mans." I asked him how many. 
He told me upon his fingers, seventeen. I asked him then what 
became of them. He told me, "They live, they dwell at my 
nation." 

This put new thoughts into my head. I presently imagined that 
these might be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away 
in the sight of my island, as I now called it ; and who, after the 
ship was Struck on the rock and they saw her inevitably lost, had 
saved themselves in their boat, and were landed upon that wild 
shore among the savages. Upon this I inquired of him more criti- 
cally what was become of them. He assured me they lived still 
there ; that they had been there about four years ; that the savages 
left them alone, and gave them victuals to live on. I asked him how 
it came to pass they did not kill them and eat them. He said, 
" No, they make brother with th^m ; " that is, as I understood him, 
a truce. Then he added, " They no eat mans but when make the 
war fight ; " that is to say, they never eat any men but such as come 
to fight with them and are taken in battle. 

It was after this some considerable time that, being upon the top 



192 

of ihe hill, at the east side of the Island, from whence, as I have 
Said, I had, in a clear day, discovered the main or continent of 
America, Friday, the weather being very serene, looks very ear- 
nestly towards the mainland, and, in a kind of surprise, falls a-jump- 
ing and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some distance 
from him. 1 asked him what was the matter. " O joy ! " says he ; 
" O glad I there see my country ! there my nation I " 

I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his 
face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a 
Strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his own country 
again. This Observation of mine put a great many thoughts into me, 
which made me, at first, not so easy about my new man Friday as I 
was before ; and I made no doubt but that, if Friday could get back 
to his own nation again, he would not only forget all his religion 
but all his Obligation to me, änd would be forward enough to give 
his countrymen an account of me, and come back, perhaps, with 
a hundred or two of them, and make a fcast upon nie, at which he 
might be as merry as he used to be with those of his enemies, when 
they were taken in war. 

But I wronged the poor, honest creature very much, for which I 
was sorry afterwards. However, as my jealousy increased, and held 
some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so familiär 
and kind to him as before. In this I was certainly wrong, too ; the 
honest, grateful creature having no thought about it but what con- 
sisted with the best principles, both as a religious Christian, and as 
a grateful friend, as appeared afterwards to my füll satisfaction. 

While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every day 
pumping him, to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts 
which I suspected were in him ; but I found everything he said 
was so honest and so innocent that I could find nothing to nour- 
ish my suspicion. In spite of all my uneasiness, he made me at 
last entirely his own again ; nor did he in the least perceive that I 
was uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit. 

One day, Walking up the same hill, but the weather being hazy 
at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I called to him, and 



193 

Said, '* Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own country, your 
own nation? " " Yes," he said. " I be much O glad to be at my 
own nation." '* What would you do there? " said I ; " wouid you 
turn wild again, eat nien's flesh again, and be a savage, as you were 
before ? " He looked füll of concern, and shaking his head, said, 
" No, no, Friday teil them to live good ; teil them to pray God ; 
teil them to eat com bread, cattle flesh, milk ; no eat man again." 
" Why, then," said I to him, " they will kill you." He looked 
grave at that, and then said, " No, no, they no kill me, they willing 
love learn." He meant by this, they would be willing- to learn. 
He added, " They learn much of the bearded mans that come in 
the boat." Then I asked him if he would go back to them. He 
smiled at that, and told me that he could not swim so far. I told 
him I would make a canoe for him. He told me he would go if 
I would go with him. " I go ! " says I ; " why they will eat me if 
I come there." " No, no," says he, " me make they no eat you ; 
me make they much love you." He meant, he would teil them 
how I had killed his enemies, and saved his life, and so he would 
make them love me. 



CHAPTER XXXVII. 

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, and 
see if I could possibly join with those bearded men, who, I made 
no doubt, were Spaniards and Portuguese ; not doubting but, if I 
could, we might find some method to escape from thence, being 
upon a continent, and a good Company together, better than I 
could from an island forty miles off the shore, alone, and without 
help. So, after some days, I took Friday to work again, by way 
of discourse, and told him I would give him a boat to go back to 
his own nation. Accordingly, I carried him to my frigate, which 
lay on the other side of the island, and having cleared it of water 
(for I always kept it sunk in water) , I brought it out, showed it 
him, and w^ both went into it. I found he was a most dexterous 
ROB. CRU. — 13 



194 

fellow at managing it, and would make it go almost as swift again 
as I could. So when he was in, I said to him, " Well, now, Friday, 
shall we go to your nation ? " He looked very dull at my saying 
so ; which, it seems, was because he thought the boat was too small 
to go so far. I then told him I had a bigger ; so the next day I 
went to the place where the first boat lay which I had made, but 
which I could not get into the water. He said that was big 
enough ; but then, as I had taken no care of it, and it had lain two 
or three and twenty years there, the sun had split and dried it, and 
it was rotten. Friday told me such a boat would do very well, arid 
would carry " much enough vittle, drink, bread ; " — this was his 
way of talking. 

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of 
going over with him to the continent, that I told him we would go 
and make one as big as that, and he should go home in it. He 
answered not one word, but looked very grave and sad. I asked 
him what was the matter with him. He asked me again, " Why 
you angry mad with Friday? what me done?" I asked him 
what he meant, and told him I was not angry with him at all. " No 
angry ! " says he, repeating the words several times ; " why send 
Friday home away to my nation ? " " Why," says I, " Friday, did 
not you say you wished you were there?" **Yes, yes," says he, 
" wish we both there ; no wish Friday there, no master there." In 
a word, he would not think of going there without me. " I go 
there, Friday?" says I, "what shall I do there?" He turned 
very quick upon me at this. "You do great deal much good," 
says he ; " you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans ; you 
teil them know God, pray God, and live new life." " Alas, Fri- 
day ! " says I, " thou knowest not what thou sayest ; I am but an 
ignorant man myself." "Yes, yes," says he, "you teachee me 
good, you teachee them good." " No, no, Friday," says I, " you 
shall go without me; leave me here to live by myself, as I did 
before." He looked confused again at that word; and running 
to one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, 
and gives it to me. " W^hat must I do with this ? " says I to him. 



195 

"You take kill Friday," says he. "What must I kill you for?" 
Said I again. He returns very quick, "What you send Friday 
away for? Take kill Friday; no send Friday away." This he 
spoke so earnestly that I saw tears stand in his eyes. In a word, 
I so plainly discovered the utmost affection in him to me, and a 
firm resolution in him, that I told him then, and often after, that 
I would never send him away from me, if he was willing to stay 
with me. 

üpon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled affec- 
' tion to me, and that nothing could part him from me, so I found 
all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid 
in his ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my doing 
them good ; a thing which, as I had no notion of myself, so I had 
not the least thought, or intention, or desire, of undertaking it. 
But still I found a strong inclination to attempting my escape, 
founded on the supposition, gathered from the discourse, that there 
were seventeen bearded men there. Therefore, without any more 
delay, I went to work with Friday to find out a great tree proper 
to feil, and make a large periagua, or canoe, to undertake the voy- 
age. There were trees enough in the island to have built a little 
fieet, not of periaguas or canoes, but even of good large vessels. 
But the main thing I looked at was to get one so near the water 
that we might launch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I 
committed at first. At last Friday pitched upon a tree; for I 
found he knew much better than I what kind of wood was fittest 
for it. Nor can I teil, to this day, what wood to call the tree we 
cut down, except that it was very like the tree we call fustic, or 
between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the 
same color and smell. 

Friday wished to bum the hollow, or cavity, of this tree out, to 
make it for a boat, but I showed him how to cut it out with tools ; 
which after I had showed him how to use, he did it very handily. 
In about a month's hard labor we finished it, and made it very 
handsome ; especially when, with our axes, which I showed him 
how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true shape 



196 

of a boat. After this, however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to 
get her along, as it were inch by inch, upon great roUers into the 
water ; but when she was in, she would have carried twenty men 
with great ease. 

It amazed me to see with what dexterity and how swift my man 
Friday could manage her, tum her, and paddle her along. So I 
asked him if he would, and if we might venture over in her. 
"Yes," he said, "we venture over in her very well, though great 
blow wind." However, I had a farther design that he knew noth- 
ing of, and that was to make a mast and a sail, and to fit her with * 
an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get ; 
so I pitched upon a straight young cedar tree, which I found near 
the place, and which there were great plenty of in the island, and 
I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave him directions how 
to shape and order it. But as to the sail, that was my particular care. 
I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old sails, enough ; but as I 
had had them now six and twenty years by me, and had not been 
very careful to preserve them, not imagining that I should ever have 
this kind of use for them, I did not doubt but they were all rotten. 
Indeed, most of them were so. However, I found two pieces 
which appeared pretty good, and with these I went to work. 
With a great deal of pains, and awkward stitching, you may be sure, 
for want of needles, I at length made a three-comered, ugly thing, 
like what we call in England a Shoulder- of- mutton sail, to go with 
a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top, such as usually 
our ships' longboats sail with, and such as I best knew how to 
manage, for it was such a one as I had to the boat in which I made 
my escape from Barbary, as related in the first part of my story. 

I was near two months performing this last work, namely, rigging 
and fitting my mast and sails ; for I finished them very complete, 
making a small stay, and a sail or foresail to it, to assist if we should 
turn to wind ward. Then, what was more than all, I fixed a rudder 
to the Stern of her to steer with. I was but a bungling shipwright, 
yet as I knew the usefulness, and even the necessity, of such a thing, 
I applied myself with so much pains to do it that at last I brought 



197 

it to pass ; though, considering the many dull contrivances I had 
for it that failed, I think it cost me almost as much labor as mak- 
ing the boat. 

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to what 
belonged to the navigation of my boat. Though he knew very well 
how to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing of what belonged to a sail 
and a rudder, and was the most amazed when he saw me work the 
boat to and again in the sea by the rudder, and how the sail jibbed, 
and filled this way or that way, as the course we sailed changed ; 
I say, when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and amazed. 
However, with a Httle use I made all these things familiär to him, 
and he became an expert sailor, except that of the compass I could 
make him understand very httle. On the other hand, as there was 
very little cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in those 
parts, there was the less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars 
were always to be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in 
the rainy seasons, and then nobody cared to stir abroad either by 
land or sea. 

I was now entered on the seven and twentieth year of my cap- 
tivity in this place ; though the last three years, that I had this 
creature with me, ought rather to be left out of the account, my 
habitation being quite of another kind than in all the rest of the 
time. I kept the anniversary of my landing here with the same 
thankfulness to God for his mercies as at first. And if I had such 
cause of acknowledgment at first, I had much more so now, hav- 
ing such additional testimonies of the care of Providence over me, 
and the great hopes 1 had of being effectually and speedily deliv- 
ered ; for I had an invincible impression upon my thoughts that 
my deliverance was at hand, and that I should not be another year 
in this place. I went on, however, with my husbandry, digging, 
planting, and fencing, as usual. I gathered and cured my grapes, 
and did every necessary thing as before. 

The rainy season was in the mean time upon me, when I kept 
more within doors than at other times. We had stowed our new 
vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up into the creek, where. 



198 

as I Said in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship ; and 
hauling her up to the shore at high-water mark, I made my man 
Friday dig a little dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep 
enough to give her water enough to float in. Then, when the tide 
was out, we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep the 
water out ; and so she lay dry as to the tide from the sea. To 
keep the rain off we laid a great many boughs of trees, so thick 
that she was as well thatched as a house ; and thus we waited for 
the months of November and December, in which I designed to 
make my adventure. 

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my 
design retumed with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for the 
voyage. And the first thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity 
of provisions, bcing the Stores for our voyage ; and I intended, in 
a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock and launch out our 
boat. I was busy öne moming upon something of this kind, when I 
called to Friday, and bid him to go to the seashore, and see if he 
could find a turtle or tortoise, a thing which we geherally got once 
a week, for the sake of the eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had 
not been long gone when he came running back, and flew over my 
outer wall, or fence, like one that feit not the ground, or the steps 
he set his feet on ; and before I had time to speak to him, he cries 
out to me, " O master ! O master ! O sorrow ! O bad [" " What's 
the matter, Friday?" says I. "O yonder there," says he, "one, 
two, three canoes ; one, two, three ! " By this way of speaking, I 
concluded there were six ; but on inquiry I found there were but 
three. "Well, Friday," says I, "do not be frightened." So I 
heartened him up as well as I could. 

However, 1 saw the poor fellow was most terribly scared, for 
nothing ran in his head but that they were come to look for him, 
and would cut him in pieces and eat him ; and the poor fellow 
trembled so that I scarcely knew what to do with him. I com- 
forted him as well as I could, and told him I was in as much danger 
as he, and that- they would eat me as well as him. " But," says I, 
" Friday, we must resolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday? " 



199 

" Me shoot," says he, " but there come many great number." " No 
matter for that/' said I, again ; " our guns will frighten them that 
we do not kill." So I asked him whether, if I resolved to defend 
him, he would defend me, and stand by me, and do just as I 
bid him. He said, " Me die when you bid die, master." So I 
made him take the two fowling pieces, which we always carried, 
and loaded them with large swan shot, as big as small pistol bullets. 
Then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs and 
five small bullets each ; and my two pistols I loaded with a brace 
of bullets each. I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my 
side, and gave Friday his hatchet. 

When I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective glass, 
and went up to the side of the hill, to see what I could discover. 
I found quickly by my glass that there were one and twenty sav- 
ages, three prisoners, and three canoes ; and that their whole busi- 
ness seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon these three human 
bodies, — a barbarous feast, indeed ! but jiothing more than, as I 
had observed, was usual with them. I observed, also, that they had 
landed, not where they had done when Friday made his escape, 
but nearer to my creek, where the shbre was low, and where a 
thick wood came almost close down tö the sea. This, with the 
abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came about, filled 
me with such indignation that I came down again to Friday, and 
told him I was resolved to go down to them, and kill them all ; and 
asked him if he would stand by me. He had now got over his 
. fright, and told me, as before, he would die when I bid die. 



CHAPTER XXXVni. 

In this fit of fury I divided the arms, which I had charged as 
before, between us. I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, 
and three guns upon his Shoulder. I took one pistol and the other 
three guns myself; and in this posture we marched out. I gave 
Friday a large bag with more powder and bullets ; and as to Orders, 



200 

I charged him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, 
or do anything tili I bid him^ and in the raean time not to speak a 
Word. In this posture I made a circuit to ray right hand of near 
a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get into the wood, so 
that I could come within shot of them before I should be dis- 
covered, which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do. 

I entered the wood, and, with all possible wariness*and silence, 
Friday following close at my heels, I marched tili I came to the 
skirt of the wood on the aide which was next to them, only that 
one Corner of the wood lay between me and them. Here I 
called softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree which was 
just at the comer of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and 
bring me word if he could see there plainly what they were doing. 
He did so, and came immediately back to me, and told me they 
might be plainly viewed there ; that they were all about their fire, 
eating the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay 
bound upon the sand a little from them, whom he said they would 
kill next. This fired the very soul within me. He told me it was 
not one of their nation, but one of the bearded men he had told 
me of, that came to their country in the boat. I was fiUed with 
horror at the very naming of the white, bearded man ; and going 
to the tree, I saw plainly by my glass a white man, who lay upon the 
beach of the sea, with his hands and his feet tied with flags, or things 
like rushes, and that he was a European, and had clothes on. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about 
fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by 
going a little way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and 
that then I should be within half a shot of them. So I withheld 
my passion, though I was indeed enraged to the highest degree ; 
and going back about twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, 
which held all the way tili I came to the other tree ; and then I 
came to a little rising ground, which gave me a füll view of them 
at the distance of about eighty yards. 

I had now not a monient to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful 
wretches sat upon the ground, all close huddled together, and had 



20I 

just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring 
him, perhaps limb by limb, to their fire, and they w6re stooping 
down to untie the bands at his feet. I tumed to Friday ; " Now, 
Friday," said I, " do as I bid thee." Friday said he would. " Then, 
Friday," says I, "do exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing." 
So I set down one of the muskets and the fowling piece upon 
the ground, and Friday did the like by his, and with the other 
musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding him to do the like. 
Then, asking him if he was ready, he said, "Yes." "Then fire at 
them," said I ; and at the same moment I fired also. 

Friday took his aim so much better than I that on the side 
that he shot he killed two of them, and wounded three more ; and 
on my side I killed one, and wounded two. They were, you may 
be sure, in a dreadful constemation ; and all of them that were 
not hurt jumped upon their feet, but did not immediately know 
which way to run, or which way to look, for they knew not from 
whence their destruction came. Friday kept his eyes close upon 
me, that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I did. As 
soon as the first shot was made, I threw down the piece, and took 
up the fowling piece, and Friday did the like. He saw me cock 
and present; he did the same again. "Are you ready, Friday?" 
said I. " Yes," says he. " Let fly, then," says I, " in the name of 
God ! " and with that I fired again among the amazed wretches, 
and so did Friday. As our pieces were now loaded with what I 
call swan shot, or small pistol bullets, we found only two drop ; 
but so many were wounded that they ran about yelling and 
screaming like mad creatures, all bloody, and most of them mis- 
erably wounded ; whereof three more feil quickly after, though not 
quite dead. 

" Now, Friday," says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and 
taking up the musket which was yet loaded, " follow me," which 
he did with a great deal of courage ; upon which I rushed out of 
the wood and showed myself, and Friday close at my foot. As 
soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud as I could, and 
bade Friday do so too, and running as fast as I could, — which, 



202 

by the way, was not very fast, being loaded with arms as I was, — 
I made directly towards the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying 
upon the beach or shore, between the place where they sat 
and the sea. The two butchers who were just going to work with 
him had left him at the surprise of our first fire, and fled in a 
terrible fright to the seaside, and had jumped into a canoe, and 
three more of the rest made the same way. I turned to Friday, 
and bade him step forward and fire at them. He understood me 
immediately, and running about forty yards, to be nearer them, he 
shot at them. I thought he had killed them all, for I saw them 
all fall of a heap into the boat, though I saw two of them up again 
quickly. However, he killed two of them, and wounded the third, 
so that he lay down in the bottom of the boat as if he had been 
dead. 

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife and 
cut the flags that bound the poor victim ; and loosing his hands 
and feet, I lifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue 
what he was. He answered in Latin, " Christianus," but was so 
weak and faint that he could scarce stand or speak. Then I 
asked him what countryman he was, and he said " Espagnole; " and 
being a little recovered, he let me know, by all the signs he could 
possibly make, how much he was in my debt for his deliverance. 
" Seignior," said I, with as much Spanish as I could make up, 
" we will talk afterward s, but we must fight now. If you have any 
strength left, take this pistol and sword, and lay about you." He 
took them very thankfully ; and no sooner had he the arms in his 
hands, but, as if they had put new vigor into him, he flew upon his 
murderers like a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an 
instant. The truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so the 
poor creatures were so much frightened with the noise of our 
pieces that they feil down for mere amazement and fear, and had 
no more power to attempt their own escape than their flesh had 
to resist our shot. That was the case of those five that Friday 
shot at in the boat ; for as three of them feil with the hurt they 
received, so the other two feil with the fright. 



203 

I kept my piece in my band still without firing, being willing to 
keep my charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my 
pistol and sword. So I called to Friday, and bade him run up 
to the tree from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which 
lay there that had been discharged, which he did with great swift- 
ness. Then giving him my musket, I sat down myself to load all 
the rest again, and bade them come to rae when they wanted. 
While I was loading these pieces, there happened a fierce engage- 
ment between the Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at 
him with one of their great wooden swords, the weapon that was 
to have killed him before, if I had not prevented it. The Span- 
iard, who was as bold and brave as could be imagined, though 
weak, had fought the Indian a good while, and had cut two great 
wounds on his head. But the savage, being a stout, lusty fellow, 
closing in with him, had thrown him down, being faint, and was 
wringing my sword out of his hand ; when the Spaniard, though 
undermost, wisely quitting the sword, drew the pistol from his 
girdle, shot the savage through the body, and killed him upon the 
spot, before I, who was running to help him, could come near him. 

Friday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches, 
with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet. With that he dis- 
patched those three who, as I said before, were wounded at first, 
and fallen, and all the rest he could come up with. The Spaniard 
Coming to me for a gun, I gave him one of the fowling pieces, 
with which he pursued two of the savages, and wounded them 
both. But, as he was not able to run, they both got from him 
into the wood, where Friday pursued them, and killed one of 
them ; but the other was too nimble for him, and though he was 
wounded, yet had plunged himself into the sea, and swam with 
all his might off to those two who were left in the canoe ; which 
three in the canoe, with one wounded, were all that escaped our 
hands out of one and twenty. 

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun- 
shot, and though Friday made two or three shots at them, I did 
not find that he hit any of them. Friday would fain have had me 



204 

take one of their canoes, and pursiie them ; and, indeed, I was 
very anxious about their escape, lest carrying the news home to 
their people, they should come back perhaps with two or three 
hundred of the canoes, and devour us by mere multitude. So I 
consented to pursue them by sea, and running to one of their 
canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me. But when I 
was in the canoe, I was surprised to find another poor creature lie 
there, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, 
and almost dead with fear, not knowing what was the matter ; for 
he had not been able to look up over the side of the boat, he was 
tied so hard neck and heels, and had been tied so long that he 
had really but little life in him. 

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they had 
bound him with, and would have helped him up ; but he could not 
stand or speak, but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems, 
still, that he was only unbound in order to be killed. When Fri- 
day came to him, I bade him speak to him, and teil him of his 
deliverance ; and the news of his being delivered revived him, 
and he sat up in the boat. But when Friday came to hear him 
speak, and look in his face, it would have moved any one to 
tears to see how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged him, 
cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sang ; then cried 
again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and head, and then sang 
and jumped about again like a distracted creature. It was a good 
while before I could make him speak to me, or teil me what was 
the matter ; but when he came a little to himself, he told me that 
it was his father. 

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what 
ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this poor savage at the 
sight of his father, and of his being delivered from death. Nor, 
indeed, can I describe half the extravagances of his affection after 
this; for he went into the boat, and out of the boat, a great 
many times. When he went in to him, he would sit down by 
him, open his breast, and hold his father's head close to his bosom 
for many minutes together, to nourish it. Then he took his arras 



205 

and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with the binding, and 
chafed and rubbed them with bis hands. 

This affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other 
savages, who were now almost out of sight. It was happy for us 
that we did not, for it blew so hard within two hours after, and 
before they could be got a quarter of their way, and continued 
blowing so hard all night, and that from the northwest, which 
was against them, that I could not suppose their boat could live, 
or that they ever reached their own coast. 



CHAPTER XXXIX. 

BuT to retum to Friday. He was so busy about his father that 
I could not find in my heart to take him off for soine time. But 
after I thought he could leave him a little, I called him to me, 
and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased to the highest 
extreme. Then I asked him if he had given his father any bread. 
He shook his head, and said, " None ; ugly dog eat all up seif." 
I then gave him a cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried on 
purpose. I had in my pocket two or three bunches of raisins, so 
I gave him a handful of them for his father. 

He had no sooner given his father these raisins, but I saw him 
come out of the boat, and run away as if he had been bewitched, 
for he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw. I say, 
he ran at such a rate that he was out of sight, as it were, in an 
instant ; and though I called, and hallooed out, too, after him, it 
was all one, — away he went. In a quarter of an hour I saw him 
come back again, though not so fast as he went, and, as he came 
nearer, I found his pace was slacker because he had something in 
his band. When he came up to me, I found he had been quite 
home for an earthen jug or pot, to bring his father some fresh 
water, and that he had got two more cakes, or loaves of bread. 
The bread he gave me, but the water he carried to his father. 
However, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little of it. 



2o6 

When his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there was 
any water left. He said " Yes ; " and I bade him give it to the 
poor Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his fether ; and 
I sent one of the cakes that Friday brought, to the Spaniard, too, 
who was indeed very weak, and was reposing himself upon a green 
place under the shade of a tree ; and whose limbs were also very 
stiff, and very much swelled with the rüde bandage he had been 
tied with. When I saw that upon Friday's Coming to him with 
the water he sat up and drank, and took the bread and began to 
eat, I went to him and gave him a handful of raisins. He looked 
up in niy face with all the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness 
that could appear in any countenance ; but was so weak, not- 
withstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could 
not stand up upon his feet. He tried to do it two or three times, 
but was really not able, his ankles were so swelled and so painflil 
to him; so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his 
ankles, as he had done his father's. 

I observed the poor, affectionate creature, every two minutes, or 
perhaps less, all the while he was here, tum his head about, to see 
if his father was in the same place and posture as he left him sitting. 
At last he found he was not to be seen ; at which he started up, 
and, without speaking a word, flew with that swiftness to him that 
one could scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went. 
But when he came, he only found he had laid himself down to ease 
his limbs, so Friday came back to me presently. Then I spoke to 
the Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him 
to the boat, and then he should carry him to our dwelling, where I 
would take care of him. But Friday, a lusty, strong fellow, took 
the Spaniard upon his back, and carried him away to the boat, 
and set him down softly upon the side or gunnel of the canoe, 
with his feet in the inside of it ; and then lifting him quite in, 
he set him close to his father. Presently stepping out again, he 
launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore faster than I 
could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard, too. So he brought 
them both safe into our creek, and leaving them in the boat, ran 



207 

Äway to fetch the other canoe. As he passed me I spoke to him, 
and asked him whither he went. He told me, " Go fetch more 
boat." So away he went like the wind, for sure never man or 
horse ran like him; and he had the other canoe in the creek 
ahnost as soon as I got to it by land. He wafted me over, and 
then went to help our new guests out of the boat, which he 
did. But they were neither of them able to walk ; so that poor 
Friday knew not what to do. 

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling to 
Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to me, I 
soon made a kind of handbarrow ^ to lay them on, and Friday and 
I carried them both up together upon it between us. But when 
we got them to the outside of our wall, or fortification, we were at 
a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to get them over, 
and I was resolved not to break it down. So I set to work again, 
and Friday and I, in about two hours' time, made a very hand- 
some tent, covered with old sails, and above that with boughs of 
trees, being in the space without our outward fence, and between 
that and the grove of young wood which I had planted. Here 
we made them two beds of such things as I had ; namely, of good 
rice straw, with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to 
cover them, on each bed. 

My Island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rieh in 
subjects. It was a merry reflection, which I frequently made, how 
like a king I looked. First of all, the whole country was my own 
property, so that I had an undoubted right of dominion. Secondly, 
my people were perfectly subjected. I was absolutely lord and 
lawgiver. They all owed their lives to me, and were ready to lay 
down their lives, if there had been occasion for it, for me. It was 
remarkable, too, I had but three subjects, and they were of three 
different religions. My man Friday was a Protestant, his father 
was a Pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Roman 
Catholic. However, I allowed liberty of conscience throughout my 
dominions. But this is by the way. 

1 A franie or stretcher. 



208 

As soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued prisoners, and 
given them shelter and a place to rest them upon, I began to 
think of making some provision for them. The first thing I did, 
I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, 
out of my particular flock, to be killed. Then I cut off the hinder 
quarter, and chopping it into small pieces, I set Friday to work to 
boiling and stewing, and made them a very good dish, I assure 
you, of flesh and broth. As I cooked it without doors, for I made 
no fire within my inner wall, so I carried it all into the new tent, 
and having set a table there for them, I sat down, and ate my own 
dinner also with them, and, as well as I could, cheered them and 
encouraged them. Friday was my Interpreter, especially to his 
father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard, too ; for the Spaniard spoke 
the language of the savages pretty well. 

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take 
one of the canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and other fire- 
arms, which, for want of time, we had left upon the place of battle. 
The next day, I ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of 
the savages, which lay open to the sun. I also ordered him to 
bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I could not 
think of doing myself; — nay, I could not bear to see them, if I 
went that way. All this he punctually performed, and effaced the 
very appearance of the savages being there ; so that when I went 
again, I could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by the 
Corner of the wood pointing to the place. 

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new 
subjects. First, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he 
thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we 
might expect a return of them, with a power too great for us to 
resist. His first opinion was that the savages in the boat never 
could live out the storm which blew that night they went off, but 
must, of necessity, be drowned, or driven south to those other 
shores, where they were as sure to be devoured as they were to be 
drowned if they were cast away. But, as to what they would do if 
they came safe on shore, he said he knew not. It was his opinion 



209 

that they were so dreadfully frightened with the manner of their 
being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he believed they would 
teil the people they were all killed by thunder and lightning, not 
by the hand of man ; and that the two which appeared, namely 
Friday and I, were two heavenly spirits, or furies, come down to 
destroy them, and not men with weapons. This, he said, he knew ; 
because he heard them all cry out so, in their language, one to an- 
other. It was impossible for them to conceive that a man could 
dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance, without lifting 
up the hand, as was done now. This old savage was in the right ; 
for, as I learned since, the savages never attempted to go over to 
the Island afterwards. They were so terrified with the accounts 
given by those four men (for it seems they did escape the sea), 
that they believed whoever went to that enchanted island would 
be destroyed with fire from the gods. 

This, however, I knew not ; and therefore was under continual 
apprehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my guard, 
with all my army. As there were now four of us, I would have ven- 
tured upon a hundred of them, fairly, in the open field, at any time. 
In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of 
their Coming wore off, and I began to take my former thoughts of a 
voyage to the main into consideration ; being likewise assured by 
Friday*s father that I might depend upon good usage from their 
nation, on his account, if I would go. 

But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a serious 
discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there 
were sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, who, having 
been cast away and made their escape to that side, lived there at 
peace, indeed, with the savages, but were very sore put to it for 
necessaries, and, indeed, for life. I asked him all the particulars 
of their voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship, bound from 
the Rio de la Plata to Havana, being directed to leave their load-

wreck. Five of their own men were drowned when first the ship 
was lost, and these escaped through infinite dangers and hazards, 
and arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal coast, where they 
expected to have been devoured every moment. He told me 
they had some arras with them, but they were perfectly useless, for 
that they had neither powder nor ball, the washing of the sea 
having spoiled all their powder but a little, which they used at 
their first landing to provide themselves with some food. 

I asked him what he thought would become of them there, and 
if they had formed any design of making their escape. He said 
they had many consultations about it ; but having neither vessel, 
nor tools to build one, nor provisions of any kind, their Councils 
always ended in tears and despair. I asked him how he thought 
they would receive a proposal from me, which might tend towards 
an escape ; and whether, if they were all here, it might not be done. 
I told him, with freedom, I feared mostly their treachery and ill- 
usage of me, if I put my life in their hands. I told him it would 
be very hard that I should be the Instrument of their deliverance, 
and that they should afterwards make me their prisoner in New 
Spain, where an Englishman was certain to be made a sacrifice, 
what necessity or what accident soever brought him thither. 

He answered, with a great deal of candor, that their condition 
was so miserable, and that they were so sensible of it, that he be- 
lieved they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly 
that should contribute to their deliverance ; that if I pleased he 
would go to them, with the old man, and discourse with them 
about it, and return again, and bring me their answer. He would 
make conditions with them, upon their solemn oath, that they 
should be absolutely under my direction, as their Commander and 
captain. He told me they were all of them very civil, honest men, 
imder the greatest distress imaginable, having neither weapons nor 
clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of the sav- 
ages, and out of all hopes of ever retuming to their own country ; 
and that he was sure, if I would undertake their relief, they would 
live and die by me.

CHAPTER XL. 



Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if 
possible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to 
them to treat. But when w^ had got all things in readiness to 
go, the Spaniard himself started an objection, which had so much 
prudence in it on one hand, and so much sincerity on the other 
hand, that I could not but be very well satisfied in it ; and, by his 
advice, I put off the deliverance of his comrades for at least half 
a year. The case was thus. He had been with us now about a 
month, during which time I had let him see in what raanner I 
had provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my support ; 
and he saw evidently what stock of com and rice I had laid up. 
Though it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was not 
sufficient, without good husbandry, for my family, now it was 
increased to four. But much less would it be sufficient if his 
countrymen, who were, as he said, fourteen still alive, should 
come over ; and, least of all would it be sufficient to victual our 
vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian 
colonies of America. So he told me he thought it would be more 
advisable to let him and the other two dig and cultivate some 
more land, as much as I could spare seed to sow, and that we 
should wait another harvest, that we might have a supply of com 
for his countrymen, when they should come ; for want might be a 
temptation to them to disagree, or not to think themselves de- 
livered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into another. 

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I 
could not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as 
I was satisfied with his fidelity. So we feil to digging, all four of 
US, as well as the wooden tools we were fumished with permitted ; 
and, in about a month's time, by the end of which it was seed- 
time, we had got as much land cured and trimmed up as we 
sowed two and twenty busheis of barley on, and sixteen jars of 
rice ; which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare. 



212 

Having now society enough, and our number being sufficient to 
put US out of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless their 
number had been very great, we went freely all over the Island, 
whenever we found occasion. As we had our escape or deliv- 
erance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at least for me, to 
have the means of it out of raine. For this purpose I marked 
out several trees, which I thought fit for our work, and I set 
Friday and his father to cut them down ; and then I caused the 
Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thoughts on that affair, to 
oversee and direct their work. I showed them with what inde- 
fatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into Single planks, and I 
caused them to do the like, tili they had made about a dozen large 
planks of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and 
from two inches to four inches thick. What prodigious labor it 
took up, any one may imagine. 

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock of tarne 
goats as much as I could. For this purpose, I made Friday and 
the Spaniard go out one day, and myself with Friday the next day 
(for we took our turns). By this means we got about twenty 
young kids to breed up with the rest ; for whenever we shot the 
dam, we saved the kids, and added them to our flock. But, 
above all, the season for curing the grapes Coming on, I caused 
such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun that I believe, 
had we been at Alicant,^ where the raisins of the sun are cured, we 
could have fiUed sixty or eighty barreis. These, with our bread, 
formed a great part of our food, — very good living too, I assure 
you, for they are exceedingly nourishing. 

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order. It was not the 
most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but it was enough 
to answer our end. From twenty-two busheis of barley we brought 
in and thrashed out above two hundred and twenty busheis, and 
the like, in proportion, of the rice ; which was störe enough for 
our food to the next harvest, though all the fourteen Spaniards 
had been on shore with me. Or, if we had been ready for a 

1 A town in Spain famott9 for its vineyards. 



213 

voyage, it would very plentifuUy have victualed our ship to have 
carried us to any part of the world, — that is to say, any part of 
America. When we had thus housed and secured our magazine 
of corn, we feil to work to make more wicker wäre ; namely, great 
baskets, in which we kept it. The Spaniard was very Handy and 
dexterous at this part, and often blamed me that I did not make 
some things for defense of this kind of work ; but I saw no need 
ofit. 

And now, having a füll supply of food for all the guests I 
expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see 
what he could do with those he had 4eft behind him there. I 
gave him a strict charge not to bring any man who would not first 
swear, in the presence of himself and the old savage, that he 
would in no way injure, fight with, or attack the person he should 
find in the island, who was so kind as to send for them in order 
for their deliverance; but that they would stand by him and 
defend him against all such attempts, and, wherever they went, 
would be entirely under and subjected to his command ; and that 
this should be put in writing, and signed in their hands. How 
they were to have done this, when I knew they had neither pen 
nor ink, was a question which we never asked. 

Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old savage, the 
father of Friday, went away in one of the canoes which they might 
be said to have come in, — or rather were brought in, — when they 
came as prisoners to be devoured by the savages. I gave each of 
them a musket, with a firelock on it, and about eight charges of 
powder and ball, charging them to husband both, and not to use 
either of them but upon urgent occasions. 

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me in 
view of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years and some days. 
I gave them provisions of bread and of dried grapes sufficient for 
themselves for many days, and sufficient for all the Spaniards for 
about eight days' time ; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw 
them go, agreeing with them about a signal they should hang out 
at their retum, by which I should know them again when they came 



214 

back, at a distance, before they came on shore. They went away 
with a fair gale on the day that the moon was at füll, by my ac- 
count in the month of October. As for an exact reckoning of days, 
after I had once lost it, I could never recover it again. 

It was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a 
Strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has 
not, perhaps, been heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my 
hut one moming, when my man Friday came running in to me, 
and called aloud, "Master, master, they are come, they are 
come ! " I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went, as soon 
as I could get my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by 
the way, was by this time grown to be a very thick wood. I say, 
regardless of danger, I went without my arms, which was not my 
custom to do. But I was surprised when, tuming my eyes to the 
sea, I presently saw a boat at about a league and a half distance, 
Standing in for the shore, with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they 
call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in. Also I 
observed, presently, that they did not come from that side which 
the shore lay on, but from the southemmost end of the island. 

lipon this I called Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these 
were not the people we looked for, and that we might not know 
yet whether they were friends or enemies. In the next place, I 
went in to fetch my perspective glass, to see what I could make 
of them ; and, having taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the 
top of the hin, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of any- 
thing, and to take my view the plainer, without being discovered. 
I had scarce set my foot upon the Hill when my eye plainly dis- 
covered a ship lying at anchor, at about two leagues and a half 
distance from me, south-southeast, but not above a league and a 
half from the shore. By my Observation it appeared plainly to bc 
an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an English longboat. 

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of 
seeing a ship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned 
by my own countrymen, and consequently friends, was such as I 
cannot describe. Yet I had some secret doubts hung about me — 



215 

I cannot teil from whence they carae — bidding me keep upon my 
guard. In the first place, it occurred to me to consider what 
business an English ship could have in that part of the world, 
since it was not the way to or from any part of the world where 
the English had any traffic. I knew there had been no storms to 
drive them in there, in distress; and that if they were really 
English, it was most probable that they were here upon no good 
design ; and that I had better continue as I was, than fall into the 
hands of thieves and murderers. 

I had not kept myself long in this posture, tili I saw the boat 
draw near the shore, as if they looked for a creek to thrust in at, 
for the convenience of landing. As they did not come quite far 
enough, they did not see the little inlet where I formerly landed 
my rafts, but ran their boat on shore upon the beach, at about 
half a mile from me ; which was very happy for me, for otherwise 
they would have landed just at my door, as I may say, and would 
soon have beaten me out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered 
me of all I had. When they were on shore, I was fuUy satisfied 
they were Englishmen, — at least most of them. One or two I 
thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so. There were in 
all eleven men, whereof three of them I found were unarmed, 
and, as I thought, bound. 

When the first four or five of them were jumped on shore, they 
took those three out of the boat as prisoners. One of the three 
I could perceive using the most passipnate gestures of entreaty, 
affliction, and despair, even to a kind of extravagance. The 
other two, I could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and 
appeared concemed indeed, but not to such a degree as the first. 
I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what the 
meaning of it could be. Friday called out to me in English, as well 
as he could, " O master ! you see English maus eat prisoner as well 
as savage mans." " Why, Friday," says I, " do you think they are 
going to eat them, then?" "Yes," says Friday, "they will eat 
them." " No, no," says I, ** Friday ; I am afraid they will murder 
them, indeed ; but you may be sure they will not eat them." 



2l6 

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, 
but stood trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every 
moment when the three prisoners should be killed. Nay, once I 
saw one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the 
seamen call it, or sword, to strike one of the poor men. I 
expected to see him fall every moment ; at which all the blood in 
my body seemed to run chill in my veins. I wished heartily now 
for the Spaniard, and the savage that was gone with him, or that I 
had any way to have come undiscovered within shot of them, that 
I might have secured the three men, for I saw no firearms they 
had among them. But it feil out to my mind another way. After 
I had observed the outrageous usage of the three men by the 
insolent seamen, I observed the fellows run scattering about the 
Island, as if they wanted to see the country. I observed that 
the three other men had liberty to go also where they pleased ; 
but they sat down all three upon the ground, very pensive, and 
looked like men in despair. This put me in mind of the first 
time when I came on shore, and began to look about me ; how 
I gave myself over for lost, how wildly I looked round me, what 
dreadful apprehensions I had, and how I lodged in the tree all 
night, for fear of being devoured by wild beasts. 



CHAPTER XLI. 

It was just at high water when these people came on shore ; 
and while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they 
were in, they had carelessly staid tili the tide was spent, and the 
water was ebbed considerably away, leaving their boat aground. 
They had left two men in the boat, who, as I found afterwards, 
having drunk a little too much brandy, feil asleep. One of them, 
waking a little sooner than the other, and finding the boat too fast 
aground for him to stir it, hallooed out for the rest, who were 
straggling about; upon which they all soon came to the boat. 
But it was past all their strength to launch her, the boat being 



217 

very heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft, oozy sand, 
almost like a quicksand. In this condition, like true seamen, who 
are, perhaps, the least of all mankind given to forethought, they 
gave it over, and away they strolled äbout the country again ; and 
I heard one of them say aloud to another, calling them off from 
the boat, " Why, let her alone, Jack, can't you ? she*ll float next 
tide ; " by which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what 
countrymen they were. 

All this while I kept myself very close, not once daring to stir 
out of my Castle any farther than to my place of Observation near 
the top of the hill ; and very glad I was to think how well it was 
fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours before the boat 
could float again, and by that time it would be dark, and I might 
be at more liberty to see their motions, and to hear their discourse, 
if they had any. In the mean time I fitted myself up for a battle, 
as before, though with more caution, knowing I had to do with 
another kind of enemy than I had at first. I ordered Friday also, 
whom I had made an excellent marksman with his gun, to load 
himself with arms. I took myself two fowling pieces, and I gave 
him three muskets. My figure, indeed, was very fierce; I had 
my formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I have men- 
tioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and a 
gun upon each Shoulder. 

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt 
tili it was dark ; but about two o'clock, being the heat of the day, 
I found that they were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I 
thought, were laid down to sleep. The three poor distressed men, 
too anxious for their condition to get any sleep, had, however,.sat 
down under the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a 
mile from me, and, as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest. 
Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn some- 
thing of their condition. Immediately I marched, with my man 
Friday at a good distance behind me, as formidable for his arms 
as I, but not making quite so staring a specter-like figure as I 
did. I came as near them undiscovered as I could and then, 



2l8 



before any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, 
"What are ye, gentlemen?" 

They started up at the noise, but were ten times more con- 
founded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure that \ made. 




They raade no answer at all, but I thought I perceived them just 
going to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English : " Gentle- 
men," said I, " do not be surprised at me ; perhaps you may have 
a friend near, when you did not expect it." " He must be sent 
directly from Heaven then," said one of them very gravely to me, 



219 

and puUing off his hat at the same time to me ; " for our condi- 
tion is past the help of man." " All help is from Heaven, sir," 
Said I : " but can you put a stranger in the way to help you ? for 
you seem to be in some great distress. I saw you when you 
landed ; and when you seemed to raake application to the brutes 
that came with you, I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill 
you." 

The poor man, with tears running down his face, and trembling, 
looking like one astonished, returned, " Am I talking to God, or 
man? Is it a real man, or an angel?" " Be in no fear about 
that, sir," said I ; " if God had sent an angel to relieve you, he 
would have come better clothed, and armed after another manner 
than you see me. Pray lay aside your fears. I am a man, an 
Englishman, and disposed to assist you, you see. I have one ser- 
vant only ; we have arms and ammunition ; teil us freely, can we 
serve you ? What is your case ? " " Our case, sir," said he, " is too 
long to teil you, while our murderers are so near us. In short, sir, 
I was Commander of that ship. My men have mutinied against 
me. They have been hardly prevailed on not to murder me, and, 
at last, have set me on shore in this desolate place, with these two 
men with me, — one my mate, the other a passenger, — where we 
expected to perish, believing the place to be uninhabited, and know 
not yet what to think of it." 

" Where are these brutes, your enemies ? " said I ; " do you know 
where they are gone ? " " There they lie, sir," said he, pointing to 
a thicket of trees ; " my heart trembles for fear they have seen us, 
and heard you speak. If they have, they will certainly murder us 
all." " Have they any firearms ? " said I. He answered, "They 
had only two pieces, and one which they left in the boat." " Well, 
then," Said I, " leave the rest to me. I see they are all asleep ; it 
is an easy thing to kill them all ; but shall we rather take them 
prisoners ? " He told me there were two desperate villains among 
them that it was scarce safe to show any mercy to ; but if they 
were secured, he believed all the rest would retum to their duty. 
I asked him which they were. He told me he could not at that dis- 



222 

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate to 
the boat, with Orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and 
sails, which they did. By and by three straggling men, that were 
(happily for them) parted from the rest, came back upon hearing 
the guns fired; and seeing the captain, who was before their 
prisoner, now their conqueror, they submitted to be bound also. 
So our victory was complete. 



CHAPTER XLII. 

It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one 
another's circumstances. I began first, and told him my whole 
history, which he heard with an attention even to amazeraent, 
and particularly at the wonderful mann er of my being furnished 
with provisions and ammunition; and indeed, as my story is a 
whole coUection of wonders, it affected him deeply. But when 
he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have 
been preserved there on purpose to save his life, the tears ran 
down his face, and he could not speak a word more. After this 
communication was at an end, I carried him and his two men into 
my apartment, leading them in just where I came out, namely, at 
the top of the house, where I refreshed him with such provisions 
as I had, and showed them all the contrivances I had made dur- 
ing my long, long inhabiting that place. 

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing. 
But above all the captain admired my fortification, and how per- 
fectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which, 
having been now planted nearly twenty years, and the trees grow- 
ing much faster than in England, was become a little wood, so 
thick that it was impassable in any part of it but at that one side 
where I had reserved my little winding passage into it. I told 
him this was my Castle and my residence, but that I had a seat in 
the country, as most princes have, whither I could retreat upon 
occasion, and I would show him that, too, another time ; but at 



present our business was to consider how to recover the ship. He 
agreed with me as to that, but told me he was perfectly at a loss 
what measures to take, for that there were still six and twenty hands 
on board, who, having entered mto a cursed conspiracy, by which 
they had all forfeited their lives to the law, would be hardened in 
it now by desperation, and would carry it on, knowing that if they 
were subdued they would be brought to the gallows as soon as they 
came to England or to any of the English colonies. Therefore, 
there would be no attacking them with so small a number as we 
were. 

I mused for some time on what he had said, and found it was a 
very rational conclusion, and that therefore something was to be 
resolved on speedily, as well to draw the men on board into some 
snare for their surprise, as to prevent their landing upon us, and 
destroying us. Upon this, it presently occurred to me that in a 
Uttle while the ship*s crew, wondering what was become of their 
comrades and of the boat, would certainly come on shore in their 
other boat to look for them, änd that then, perhaps, they might 
come armed, and be too strong for us. This he allowed to be 
rational. Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to do was 
to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so that they might not 
carry her off, and, taking everything out of her, leave her so far 
useless as not to be fit to swim. Accordingly we went on board, 
took the arms which were left on board out of her, and whatever 
eise we found there, — which was a bottle of brandy, and another 
of rum, a few biscuit cakes, a hom of powder, and a great lump of 
sugar in a piece of canvas. The sugar was five or six pounds. All 
this was very welcome to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of 
which I had had none left for many years. 

When we had carried all these things on shore, (the oars, mast, 
sail, and rudder of the boat were carried away before,) we knocked 
a great hole in her bottom, that if they had come strong enough to 
master us, yet they could not carry off the boat. Indeed, it was 
not much in my thoughts that we could be able to recover the ship. 
But my view was that if they went away without the boat, I did 



224 

not much question to make her again fit to carry us to the Lee- 
ward Islands, and call upon our fiiends the Spaniards in my way ; 
for I had them still in my thoughts. 

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by 
main strength, he.aved the boat upon the beach so high that the 
tide would not float her off at high-water mark, and, besides, had 
broken a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and 
were sat down musing what we should do, we heard the ship fire a 
gun, and saw her make a waft with her ensign as a signal for the 
boat to come on board. But no boat stirred, and they fired sev- 
eral times, making other Signals for the boat. At last, when all 
their Signals and firing proved fruitless, and they found the boat 
did not stir, we saw them, by the help of my glasses, hoist another 
boat out, and row towards the shore. We found, as they ap- 
proached, that there were no less than ten men in her, and that 
they had firearms with them. 

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a fiiU 
view of them as they came, and a piain sight even of their faces ; 
because the tide having set them a little to the east of the other 
boat, they rowed up under shore, to come to the same place where 
the other had landed, and where the boat lay. By this means, I 
say, we had a füll view of them, and the captain knew the persons 
and characters of all the men in the boat, of whom, he said, there 
were three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into this 
conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered and frightened ; but that 
as for the boatswain, who, it seems, was the chief ofiicer among 
them, and all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of the ship's 
crew, and were no doubt made desperate in their new enterprise. 

We had, upon the first appearance of the boats Coming from the 
ship, considered of separating our prisoners ; and we had, indeed, 
secured them effectually. • Two of them, of whom the captain was 
less assured than ordinary, I sent with Friday and one of the three 
delivered men, to my cave, where they were remote enough, and 
out of danger of being heard or discovered, or of finding their way 
out of the woods if they could have delivered themselves. Here 



225 

they left them bound, but gave them provisions, and promised 
thenj, if they continued there quietly, to give them their liberty ip 
a day or two ; but that if they attempted their escape, they i^hould 
be put to death without mercy. They promised faithfuUy to bear 
their confinement with patience, and were very thankful that they 
had such good usage as to have provisions and light left them. 
Friday gaye them capdles for their comfbrt ; and thpy did not 
know but that he stood sentinel over them at the entranc45. 

The other prisopers had better usage. Two of them were kept 
pinioned, indeed, because the captain was not able to trust them ; 
bujt the ojther two were taken into my Service, upon the captain'^ 
reoommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to live and 
die with US. So with them and the three honest men we were 
seyen men, well armed ; and I n>ade no doubt we should be able 
to deal weJJ enough with the ten that were coming, considering 
that the captain had said there were three or fpur honest mep 
among them also, 

A.S soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay, they 
ran their boat into the beach and came all on shore, hauling the 
boat up aftpr them, which I was glad to see, for I was afraid they 
woqld rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance fron? 
the shore, with some hands in her, to guard her, and so we shouJd 
not be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing they 
did, they ^1 ran to their other boat. It was easy to see they wefe 
under a great surprise to find her stripped of all that was in her, 
and a great hole in her bottom. After they had mused awhile 
upon this, they set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all 
their might, to try if they could make their companions hear. But 
all was to no purpose. Then they came all close in a ring, and 
fired a volley of their small arms, which, indeed, we heard, and 
the echoes made the woods ring. But it was all one ; those in 
the cave, we were sure, could not hear ; and those in ouf keeping, 
though they heard it well enough, yet durst giye no answer to them. 
They were so astonished at this that, as they told us afterwards, 
they resojved to go all on board again to their ship, and let them 
RGB. CRU. — 15 



226 

know that the men were all murdered, and the longboat staved. 
Accordingly, they iramediately launched their boat again, and got 
all of them on board. 

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at this, 
believing they would go on board the ship again and set sail, giv- 
ing their comrades over for lost, and .so he should still lose the 
ship, which he was in hopes we should have recovered. But he 
was quickly as much frightened the other way. 

They had not been long put off with the boat, when we perceived 
them all Coming on shore again, but with this new measure, which 
it seems they consulted together upon ; namely, to leave three men 
in the boat, and the rest to gp on shore, and go up into the country 
to look for their fellows. This was a great disappointment to us, 
for now we were at a loss what to do, as our seizing those seven 
men on shore would be no advantage to us if we let the boat escape. 
They would row away to the ship, and then the rest of them would 
be sure to weigh and set sail, and so our recovering the ship would 
be lost. However, we had no remedy but to wait and see what 
the issue of things might present. 

The seven men came on shore, and the three who remained in 
the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore, and came 
to an anchor to wait for them ; so that it was impossible for us to 
come at thbm in the boat. Those that came on shore kept close 
together, marching towards the top of the little hill under which 
my habitation lay ; and we could see them plainly, though they 
could not perceive us. We should have been very glad if they 
would have come nearer to us, so that we might have fired at 
them, or that they would have gone farther off, that we might 
come abroad. But when they were come to the brow of the hill 
where they could see a great way into the Valleys and woods, which 
lay towards the northeast part, and where the Island lay lowest, 
they shouted and hallooed tili they were weary. Not caring, it 
seems, to venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, 
they sat down together under a tree to consider it. Had they 
thought fit to go to sleep there, as the other part of them had 



227 

done, they had done the Job for us; but they were too füll of 
apprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep, though they 
could not teil what the danger was they had to fear. 

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consul- 
tation of theirs ; namely, that perhaps they would all fire a volley 
again, to endeavor to make their fellows hear, and that yve should 
all sally upon them just at the juncture when their pieces were all 
discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we should have 
them without bloodshed. I liked this proposal, provided it was 
done while we were near enough to come up to them before they 
could load their pieces again. But this event did not happen; 
and we lay still a long time> very irresolute what course to take. 

At length, I told them there would be nothing to be done, in my 
opinion, tili night. Then, if they did not return to the boat, per- 
haps we might find a way to get between them and the shore, and 
so raight use some stratagem with those in the boat to get them on 
shore. We waited a great while, though very impatient for their 
removing ; and were very uneasy when, after long consultation, we 
saw them all start up, and march down towards the sea. It seems 
they had such dreadful apprehensions of the danger of the place 
that they resolved to go on board the ship again, give their com- 
panions over for lost, and so go on with their intended voyage with 
the ship. 



CHAPTER XLIII. 

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined 
it to be, as it really was, that they had given over their search, and 
were going back again. The captain, as soon as I told him my 
thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehension of it. But I pres- 
ently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back again, which 
answered my end to a tittle. 

I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over the little 
creek westward, towards the place where the savages came on shore 



228 

when Friday was rescued, and so soon as they came to a üttle rising 
ground, at about half a mile distance, I bade them hatloo out, as 
loud as they could, and wait tili they found the seamen heard theto. 
As soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them, they should 
returh it again, and then, keeping out of sight, take a round, always 
answeting when the others hallooed, to draw them as far into the 
Island and among the woods as possible, and then wheel about 
again to me by such ways as I directed them. 

They were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate 
hallooed. They presently heard them, and, answering, ran along 
the shore westward, towards the voice they heard, when they were 
stopped by the creek, where, the water being up, they could not 
get over, and called for the boat to come up and set them over; 
as, indeed, I expected. 

When they had set themselves over, I observed that, the boat 
being gone a good way into the creek, and, as it were, in a harbor 
within the land, they took ofte of the three me.n out of her, to go 
along with them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened her 
to the stump of a little tree on the shore. This was what I wished 
for. Immediately leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their 
business, I took the rest with me ; and, crossing the creek out of 
their sight, we surprised the two men before they wefe aware, — 
one of them lying on the shore, and the other being in the boat. 
The fellow on shore was between sleeping and waking, and going 
to Start up. The captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him, and 
knocked him down, and then called out to him in the boat to 
yield, or he was a dead man. 

There needed very few arguments to persuade a siligle man to 
yield, when he saw five men upon him and his comrade knocked 
down. Besides, this was, it seems, one of the three who were not so 
hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore he was 
easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to join very sin- 
cerely with us. In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate 
so well managed their business with the rest that they drew them, 
by hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from 



229 

one wood to another, tili they not only heartily tired them, but 
left them where they were very sure they could not reach back to 
the boat before it was dark. Indeed, they were heartily tired 
themselves, also, by the time they came back to us. 

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, 
and to fall upon them so as to make sure work with them. It 
wa$ several hours after Friday came back to me before they came 
back to their boat. We could hear the foremost of them, long 
before they came quite up, calling to those behind to come along ; 
and could also hear them answer, and complain how lame and 
tired they were, and not able to come any faster ; which was very 
welcome news to us. At length they came up to the boat ; but 
it is impossible to express their confusion when they found the 
boat fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two 
men gone. We could hear them call one to another in a most 
lamentable manner, telling one another they were got into an 
enchanted island ; that either there were inhabitants in it, and 
they should all be murdered, or eise there were devils and spirits 
in it, and they should be all carried away and devoured. 

They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their 
names a great many times ; but no answer. After some time we 
could see them, by the little light there was, running about, wring- 
ing their hands like men in despair. Sometimes they would go and 
sit down in the boat to rest themselves; then come ashore again, 
and walk about again, and so the same thing over again. My 
men would fain have had me give them leave to fall upon them 
at once in the dark j but I was willing to take them at some 
advantage, so as to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could. 
Especially I was unwilling to hazard the kilHng of any of our men, 
knowing the others were very well armed. I resolved to wait, to 
see if they did not separate. Therefore, to make sure of them, I 
drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain 
to creep upon their hands and feet, as close to the ground as they 
could, that they might not be discovered, and get as near them as 
they possibly could, before they offered to fire. 



230 

They had not been long in that posture when the boatswain, 
who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now 
shown hiniself the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest, 
came Walking towards them, with two more of the crew. The 
captain was so eager at having this principal rogue so much in his 
power, that he could hardly have patience to let him come so near 
as to be sure of him, for they only heard his tongue before. But 
when they came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on 
their feet, let fly at them. The boatswain was killed upon the 
spot; the next man was shot in the body and feil just; by him, 
though he did not die tili an hour or two after ; and the third ran 
for it. At the noise of the fire I immediately advanced with my 
whole army, which was now eight men ; namely, myself, generalis- 
simo ; Friday, my lieutenant general ; the captain and his two men, 
and the three prisoners of war whom we had trusted with arms. 

We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could 
not see our number; and I made the man they had left in the 
boat, who was now one of us, call to them by name, to try if I 
could bring them to a parley and so perhaps might reduce them 
to terms. This feil out just as we desired; for, indeed, it was 
easy to think, as their condition then was, they would be very 
willing to capitulate. So he calls out as loud as he could to one 
of them, " Tom Smith ! Tom Smith ! " Tom Smith answered im- 
mediately, "Is that Robinson?" for it seems he knew the voice. 
The other answered, " Ay, ay ; for God's sake, Tom Smith, 
throw down your arms and yield, or you are all dead men this 
moment." 

"Who must we yield to? Where are they? " says Smith again. 
" Here they are," says he ; " here*s our captain and fifty men with 
him, have been hunting you these two hours. The boatswain is 
killed. Will Fry is wounded, and I am a prisoner. If you do not 
yield, you are all lost." "Will they give us quarter then?" says 
Tom Smith, " and we will yield." " I'll go and ask, if you prom- 
ise to yield," says Robinson. So he asked the captain; and the 
captain himself then calls out, " You, Smith, you know my voice ; 



231 

if you lay down your arms immediately, and submit, you shall 
have your lives, all but Will Atkins." 

Upon this, Will Atkins cried out, "For God*s sake, captain, 
give me quarter ! What have I done ? They have all been as bad 
as I ; " which, by the way, was not true ; for, it seems, this Will 
Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the captain when they 
first mutinied, and used him barbarously in tying his hands and 
giving him injurious language. However, the captain told him he 
must lay down his arms at discretion, and trust to the govemor's 
mercy, — by which he meant me, for they all called me govemor. 
In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged their lives. 
I sent the man that had parleyed with them, and two more, who 
bound them all. Then my great army of fifty raen, which, with 
those three, were in all but eight, came up and seized upon them 
and upon their boat ; only that I kept myself and one more out 
of sight, for reasons of State. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the 
ship. As for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, 
he expostulated with them upon the villainy of their practices with 
him, and upon the further wickedness of their design, and how 
certainly it must bring them to misery and distress in the end, and 
perhaps to the gallows. 

They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their lives. 
As for that, he told them they were not his prisoners, but those of 
the Commander of the island ; that they thought they had set him 
on shore in a barren, uninhabited island, but it had pleased God 
so to direct them that it was inhabited, and that the governor 
was an Englishman ; that he might hang them all there, if he 
pleased, but as he had given them all quarter, he süpposed he 
would send them to England, to be dealt with there as justice re- 
quired, except Atkins, whom he was commanded by the govemor 
to advise to prepare for death, for that he would be hanged in the 
morning. 

Though this was all but a fiction of his o^m, yet it had its de- 
sired effect. Atkins feil upon his knees, to beg the captain to 



232 

Intefcede with the governor for his life ; and all the fest 
begged of him, for God's sake, that they might not be sent to 
England. 

It now occurred to me that the time of out deliverance was come, 
and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to 
be hearty in getting possession of the ship. So I retired in the 
dark frort! them, that they might not see what kind of a governor 
they had, and called the captain to me. When I cälled, as at a 
good distance, one of the men was ordered to speak agaln, änd say 
to the captain, " Captain, the Commander calls for yoü; '* and prea- 
ently the captain replied, " Teil his Excellency I am just Coming." 
This more perfectly amazed them, and they all believed thät the 
Commander was just by, with his fifty men. 

Üpoli the captain's comiflg to me, I told him my project föt 
seizing the ship, which he liked wonderfully well, and fesolved to 
put it in execution the next morning. But, in Order to execute 
it with more art, and to be secure of success, I told him we must 
divide the prisonets, and that he should go and take Atkins, and 
two more of the worst of them, and äetid them pinioned to the 
cave where the others lay. This was committed to Friday and 
the two men who came on shore with the captain. • They con- 
veyed them to the cave as to a prison, and it was, indeed, ä 
dismal place. The othets I Ordered to my bower. As it was 
fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was secüre enough, 
Considering they were upon theif behavior. 

To these in the morning I äent the captain, who was to enter 
into a parley with them ; in a word, to try them, and teil me whether 
he thought they might be trusted or not to go on board and sur- 
prise the ship. He talked to them of the injury done him, of the 
conditioti they were brought to, and that though the governor had 
given them quarter for their lives as to the present action, yet that 
if they were sent to England they would all be hanged in chains ; 
but that if they would join in so just an attempt as to recover 
the ship, he would have the governor's engagement for their 
pardon. 



233 



CHAPTER XLIV. 

Any one may güess hotv readily such a proposal would be ac- 
cepted by men in their condition. They feil down on their knees 
to the captain, and promised, with the deepest imprecatlons, that 
they troüld be faithful to him to the last drop, and that they shoüld 
oive their lives to hitn, and would go with him all over the World ; 
that they would own him as a father to them as long as they lived. 
" Well/' Said the captain, " I must go and teil the governor what 
you say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it.** So 
he brought mc an account of the temper he found them in, and , 
that he verily believed they would be faithful. 

However, that we might be very secure, I told him he should go 
back again and choose out five of them, and teil them that they 
might see he did not want men, but that he would take out those 
five to be his assistants, and that the governor would keep the other 
two, and the three that were sent prisoners to the Castle (my cave), 
as hostages for the fidelity of those üvq ; and that if they proved 
unfaithfui in the execution, the five hostages should be hanged in 
chains alive on the shore. This looked severe, and convinced 
them that the governor was in earnest ; however, they had no way 
left them but to accept it ; and it was now the büsiness of the pris- 
oners, as much as of the captain, to persuade the other five to do 
their duty. 

Onr strength was now thus ordered for the expedition : first, 
the captain, his mate, and passenger ; second, the two prisoners of 
the first gang, to whom, having their character from the captain, I 
had given their Hberty, and trusted them with arms ; third, the 
other two that I had kept tili now in my bower pinioned, but, on 
the captain's motion, had now released ; fourth, Ihese five, released 
at last ; so that they were twelve in all, besides üve we kept pris- 
oners in the cave for hostages. 

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands 
on board the ship. As for me and my man Fridäy, I did not think 



234 

it was proper for us to stir, having seven men left behind ; and it 
was employment enough for us to keep them asunder, and supply 
them with victuals. As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep 
them fast ; but Friday went in twice a day to them, to supply them 
with necessaries ; and I made the othet two carry provisions to a 
certain distance, where Friday was to take them. 

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the cap- 
tain, who told them I was the person the govemor had ordered to 
look after them, and that it was the govemor's pleasur^ they 
should not stir anywhere but by my direction ; that if they did, 
they would be fetched into the-castle, and be laid in irons. So, as 
we never suffered them to see me as govemor, I now appeared as 
another person, and spoke of the govemor, the garrison, the Castle, 
and the like, upon all occasions. 

The captain now had no difficulty before him but to fumish his 
two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He made his 
passenger captain of one, with four of the men ; and himself, 
his mate, and five more, went in the other. They contrived their 
business very well, for they came up to the ship about midnight. 
As soon as they came within call of the ship, he made Rojbinson 
hail them, and teil them they had brought off the men and the 
boat, but that it was a long time before they had found them, and 
the like, holding them in a chat tili they came to the ship's side. 
Then the captain and the mkte, entering first with their arms, im- 
raediately knocked down the second mate and carpenter with the 
butt end of their muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their 
men. They secured all the rest that were upon the main and 
quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches to keep them 
down that were below. The other boat and their men, entering 
at the fore chains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle 
which went down into the cookroom, making three men they 
found there prisoners. 

When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain ordered 
the mate, with three men, to break into the roundhouse, where 
the new rebel captain lay, who, having taken the alarm, had got 



235 

up, and with two men and a boy had got firearms in their hands. 
When the mate, with a crow, split open the door, the new captain 
and his men fired boldly among them, and wounded the mate with 
a musket ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two more of the 
men, but killed nobody. The mate, calling for help, rushed, how- 
ever, into the roundhouse, wounded as he was, and, with his pis- 
tol, shot the new captain through the head, the bullet entering at 
his mouth, and Coming out again behind one of his ears, so that 
he never spoke a word more. Upon this the rest yielded, and the 
ship was taken effectually, without any more lives lost. 

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven 
guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to 
give me notice of his success, which, you may be sure, I was very 
glad to hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it tili near 
two o'clock in the morning. Having thus heard the signal plainly, 
I laid me down ; and it having been a day of great fatigue to me, 
I slept very sound, tili I was surprised with the noise of a gun. 
Starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of " Governor ! 
Govemor ! " and presently I knew the captain's voice ; when, 
climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and, pointing 
to the ship, he embraced me in his arms. " My dear friend and 
deliverer," says he, " there's your ship ; for she is all yours, and 
so are we, and all that belong to her." I cast my eyes to the 
ship, and there she rode, within little more than half a mile of 
the shore ; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were 
masters of her, and, the weather being fair, had brought her to an 
anchor just against the mouth of the little creek. The tide being 
up, the captain had brought the pinnace in near the place where 
I had first landed my rafts, and so larided just at my door. 

I was at first ready to sink down with the surprise ; for I saw 
my deliverance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things easy, 
and a large ship just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to 
go. At first, for some time, I was not able to answer him one 
word ; but as he had taken me in his arms, I held fast by him, or 
I should have fallen to the groundi He perceived the surprise. 



236 

and immediately pulled a bottle out of bis pocket and gave me a 
dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me. After 
I had drunk it, I sat down upon the ground; and though it 
brought me to myself, yet it was a good while before I could 
speak a word to him. 

All this time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only 
not under any surprise as I was. He said a thousand kind and 
tender things to me, to compose and bring me to myself; but such 
was the flood of joy in my breast that it put all ray spirits into 
confusion. At last it broke out into tears ; and, in a little while 
after, I recovered my speech. We rejoiced together. I told him 
I looked upon him as a man sent by Heaven to dcliver me, and 
that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders ; that 
such things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret band 
of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that the eye 
of an infinite Power could search into the remotest corner of the 
world, and send help to the miserable whenever he pleased. 

When we had talked awhile, the captain told me he had brought 
me some little refreshment, such as the ship afforded, and such as 
the wretches that had been so long his masters had not plundered 
him of. Upon this, he called aloud to the boat and bade his men 
bring the things ashore that were for the govemor ; and, indeed, it 
was a present as if I had been one that was not to be carried away 
with them, but as if I had been to dwell upon the island still. First, 
he had brought me a case of bottles füll of excellent cordial waters, 
six large bottles of Madeira wine (the bottles held two quarts each), 
two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the 
ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag of peas, and about 
a hundredweight of biscuit. He also brought me a box of sugar, 
a box of flour, a bag füll of lemons, two bottles of lime juice, and 
abundaoce of other things. 

But besides these, and what was a thousand times more useful 
to me, he brought me six new, clean shirts, six very good neck- 
cloths, two pairs of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair 
of stockings, with a very good suit of clothes of his own, which 



237 

had been worn but very little. In a word, he clothed me from 
head to foot. It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any 
one may imagine, to one in ray circumstances, but never was any- 
thing in the wörld of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy 
as it was to me to wear such clothes at first. 

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things 
were brought into my little apartment, we began to consult what 
was to be done with the prisoners we had, — whether we might vent- 
ure to take them away with us or no, especially two of them, whom 
he knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree. The 
captain said he knew they were such rogues that ther^ was no oblig- 
ing them, and if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as 
malefactors, to be delivered over to justice at the first English col- 
ony he could come to. Upon this I told him that, if he desired 
it, I would undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make 
it their own request that he should leave them upon the island. 
" I should be very glad of that," says the captain, " with all my 
heart." "Well," says I, "I will send for them up, and talk with 
them for you." So I caused Friday and the two hostages to go to 
the cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned as they were, to the 
bower, and keep them there tili I came. 

After some time I came thither, dressed in my new habit. Being 
all met, and the captain with me, I caused the men to be brought 
before me, and I told them I had got a füll account of their villain- 
ous behavior to the captain, and how they had run away with the 
ship, and were preparing to commit further robberies, but that Prov- 
idence had insnared them in their own ways, and that they were 
fallen into the pit which they had digged for others. I let them know 
that by my direction the ship had been seized ; that she lay now in 
the road ; and that they might see by and by that their new captain 
had received the reward of his villainy, and that they would see 
him hanging at the yardarm. As to them, I wanted to know what 
they had to say why I should not execute them as pirates taken in 
the fact, as they could not doubt but I had authority so to do. 

One of them answered, in the name of the rest, that they had 



238 

nothing to say but this, that when they were taken the captain 
promised them their lives ; and they humbly implored my mercy. 
But I told them I knew not what mercy to show them ; for as for 
myself, I had resolyed to quit the Island with all my men, and had 
taken passage with the captain to go to England ; and as for the 
captain, he could not carry them to England other than as pris- 
oners in kons, to be tried for mutiny and running away with the 
ship ; the consequence of which, they must needs know, would be 
the gallows. I could not teil what was best for them, unless they 
had a mind to take their fate in the island. If they desired that, 
as I had liberty to leave the island, I had some inclination to give 
them their lives, if they thought they could shift on shore. They 
seemed very thankful for it, and said they would much rather ven- 
ture to stay there than be carried to England to be hanged. So I 
left it on that issue. 

CHAPTER XLV. 

When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then told 
them I would let them into the story of my living there, and put 
them into the way of making it easy to them. Accordingly, I gave 
them the whole history of the place, and of my Coming to it ; showed 
them my fortifications, the way I made my bread, planted my corn, 
cured my grapes, and, in a word, all that was necessary to make 
them easy. I told them the story, also, of the fifteen Spaniards that 
were to be expected, for whom I left a letter, and made them prom- 
ise to treat them in common with themselves. Here it may be 
noted that the captain, who had ink on board, was greatly surprised 
that I never hit upon a way of making ink of charcoal and water, 
or of something eise, as I had done things much more difficult. 

I left them my firearms ; namely, five muskets, three fowling- 
pieces, and three swords. I had above a barrel and a half of 
powder left ; for after the first year or two I used but little, and 
wasted none. I gave them a description of the way I managed 
the goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, and to make 



239 

both butter and cheese. In a word, I gave them every part of my 
own Story, and told them I should prevail with the captain to 
leave them two barreis of gunpowder more, and some garden seeds 
which I told them I would have been very glad of. Also, I gave 
them the bag of peas which the captäin had brought me to eat, 
and bade them be sure to sow and increase them. 

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and went on board 
the ship. We prcpared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that 
night. The next morning early, two of the five men came swim- 
ming to the ship's side, and, making the most lamentable com- 
plaint of the other three, begged to be taken into the ship for God's 
sake, for they should be murdered, and begged the captain to take 
them on board, though he hanged them immediately. Upon this 
the captain pretended to have no power without me. After some 
difficulty, and after their solemn promises of amendment, they were 
taken on board, and were, some time after, soundly whipped ; after 
which they proved very honest and quiet fellows. 

Some time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the tide 
being up, with the things promised to the men; to which the 
captain, at my intercessiori, caused their chests and clothes to be 
added, which they took, and were very thankful for. I also en- 
couraged them by telling them that if it lay in my power to send 
any vessel to take them in, I would not forget them. 

When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for relics, 
the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and my parrot. 
Also, I forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned, which 
had lain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished, 
and could hardly pass for silver tili it had been a little rubbed and 
handled, as also the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship. 

And thus I left the island, the iQth of December, as I found by 
the ship's account, in the year 1686, after I had been upon it eight 
and twenty years, two months, and nineteen days ; being deliv- 
ered from this second captivity the same day of the month that I 
first made my escape in the longboat from among the Moors of 
Sallee. In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in England 



240 

the ijth of June, in the year 1687, having been thirty-five years 
absent. 

When I came to England, I was as perfect a stranger to all the 
World as if I had never been known there. My benefactor and 
faithful Steward, whom I had left my money in trust with, was 
alive, but was become a widow the second time, and very low in 
the World. But my father was dead, and my mother ; and as I 
had been long ago given over for dead, there had been no Provi- 
sion made for me ; so that, in a word, I found nothing to relieve 
or assist me. The little money I had would not do much for me 
as to settHng in the world. 

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not expect ; 
and this was that the master of the ship, whom I had so happily 
deUvered, and by the same means saved the ship and cargo, hav- 
ing given a very handsome account to the owners of the manner in 
which I had saved the lives of the men, and the ship, they invited 
me to meet them and some other merchants concerned, and all 
together made me a very handsome compliment upon the subject, 
and a present of almost ;^20o Sterling. 

After making several reflections upon the circumstances of my 
life, and how little way this would go towards settling me in the 
World, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come at 
some Information of the State of my plantation, in Brazil, and of 
what was become of my partner, who, I had reason to suppose, 
had some years past given me over for dead. With this view I 
took shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in April following. My 
man Friday accompanied me very honestly in all these ramblings, 
and proved a most faithful servant upon all occasions. When I 
came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and to my particular sat- 
isfaction, my old friend, the captain of the ship who first took me 
up at sea off the shore of Africa. He was now grown old, and had 
left off going to sea, having put his son into his ship, who still used 
the Brazil trade. The old man did not know me. Indeed, I hardly 
knew him ; but I soon brought him to my remembrance, and as soon 
brought myself to his remembrance, when I told him who I was. 



241 

After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance be- 
tween us, I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and niy 
partner. The old man told me he had not been in Brazil for about 
nine years, but that he could assxire me that when he came away 
my partner was living. He believed I would have a very good 
account of the improvement of the plantation ; for that, upon the 
general belief of my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had 
given in the account of the produce of my part of the plantation to 
the government. 

He told me he could not teil exactly to what degree the plantation 
was improved ; but this he k^new, that my partner was grown exceed- 
ing rieh upon the enjoying his part of it; that as to my being restored 
to a quiet possession of it, there was no question to be made of that, 
my partner being alive to witness my title, and my name being also 
enrolled in the register of the country. 

After a few days' further Conference with this ancient friend, he 
brought me an account of the first six years' income of my planta- 
tion, signed by my partner and the merchant trustees. I found by 
this account that every year the income considerably increased ; 
but, the disbursements being large, the sum at first was small. 
However, the old man let me see that he was debtor to me four 
hundred and seventy moidores ^ of gold, besides sixty chests of 
sugar, and fifteen double rolls of tobacco. 

Never was anything more honorable than the proceedings which 
foUowed. In less than seven months I received a large packet from 
the survivors of my trustees, the merchants, for whose account I went 
to sea. There was also a letter of my partner's, congratulating me 
very affectionately upon my being alive, and concluding with a hearty 
tender of his friendship, and that of his family. He sent me, as a 
present, seven fine leopards' skins, which he had received from 
Africa, by some other ship that he had sent thither, and which, 
it seems, had made a better voyage than I. He sent me.also five 
chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of gold un- 
coined, not quite so large as moidores. By the same fleet, my

242 

two merchant trustees shipped me one thousand two hundred 
chests of sugar, eight hundred rolls of tobacco, and the rest of 
the whole account in gold. 

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was 
better than the beginning. It is impossible to express the flutter- 
ings of my very heart when I found all my wealth about me ; for 
as the Brazil ships come all in fleets, the same ships which brought 
my letters brought my goods, and the effects were safe in the 
river before the letters came to my band. In a word, I turned 
pale, and grew sick ; and, had not the old man run and fetched 
me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had overset 
nature, and I had died upon the spot. Nay, after that, I con- 
tinued very ill, and was so some hours. 

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand 
pounds Sterling in money, and had an estate, as I might well call 
it, in Brazil, of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an 
estate of lands in England. In a word, I was in a condition which 
I scarce knew how to und erstand, or how to compose myself for 
the enjoyment of it. The first thing I did was to recompense my 
original benefactor, my good old captain, who had been first char- 
itable to me in my distress, kind to me in my beginning, and 
honest to me at the end. I showed him all that was sent to me ; 
I told him that, next to the providence of Heaven, which disposed 
all things, it was owing to him, and that it now lay on me to 
reward him, which I would do a hundredfold. I first returned to 
him the hundred moidores I had received of him ; then I sent 
for a notary, and caused him to draw up a general release or dis- 
charge from the four hundred and seventy moidores, which he 
had acknowledged he owed me, in the füllest manner possible ; 
and by a clause in the end, I made a grant of one hundred moi- 
dores a year to him during his life, and fifty moidores a year to 
his son after him, for his life. Thus I requited my old man. 

I had not a cave now to hide my money in, or a place where it 
might lie without lock or key tili it grew moldy and tamished 
before anybody would meddle with it. On the contrary, I knew 



243 

not where to put it, or whom to trust with it. My old patron, 
the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the only refuge I 
had. In the next place, my interest in Brazil seemed to summon 
me thither. But now I could not teil how to think of going thither 
tili I had settled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands 
behind me. At first I thought of my old friend the widow, who 
I knew was honest, and would be just to me; but then she was 
in years and but poor, and, for aught I knew, might be in debt. 
In a word, I had no way but to go back to England myself, and 
take my effects with me. 

I landed safe at Dover the i4th of January, after having had a 
severe cold season to travel in. Poor Friday was really frightened 
when he saw the mountains all covered with snow, and feit cold 
weather, which he had never seen or feit before in his life. 

My principal guide and privy counsellor was my good, ancient 
widow, who, in gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought 
no pains too much nor care too great to employ for me. I trusted 
her so entirely with everything that I was perfectly easy as to the 
security of my effects. 

Any one would think that in this State of complicated good 
fortune, I was past running any more hazards, — and so, indeed, I 
had been, if other circumstances had concurred. But I was inured 
to a wandering life, and had no family ; so I had a great mind to 
be upon the wing again. Especially I could not resist the strong 
inclination I had to see my island, and to know if the poor Span- 
iards were in being there. My true friend, the widow, eamestly 
dissuaded me from it, and so far prevailed with me that for almost 
seven years she prevented my running abroad, during which time 
I took my two nephews into my care. The eldest, having some- 
thing of his own, I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a settl^- 
ment of some addition to his es täte after my decease. The other 
I placed with the captain of a ship. After five years, finding him 
a sensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into a good 
ship, and sent him to sea. 

In the mean time, I in part settled myself. First of all, I mar- 



244 

ried, and had three children, two sons and one daughter. But my 
wife dying, and my nephew Coming home with good success from 
a voyage to Spain, my inclination to go abroad, and bis importu- 
nity, prevailed, and engaged me to go in bis sbip as a private 
trader to tbe East Indies. This was in the year 1694. 

In this voyage I visited my new colony in the island, saw my 
successors the Spaniards, and had the wbole story of their lives, 
and of tbe villains I left tbere, — how at first they insulted tbe poor 
Spaniards, how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, sepa- 
rated, and how at last tbe Spaniards were obliged to use violence 
with them ; how they were subjected to tbe Spaniards, how hon- 
estly the Spaniards used them, — a bistory, if it were entered 
into, as füll of variety and wonderful accidents as my own pari ; 
particularly, also, as to their battles with tbe Caribbeans, who 
landed several times upon tbe island, and as to the improvement 
they made upon the island itself. 

Here I staid about twenty days, and left them supplies of all 
necessary things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes, 
tools, and two workmen whom I had brought from England with 
me, — namely, a carpenter and a smith. 

Besides this, I shared tbe landsinto parts with them. I reserved 
to myself the property of the wbole, but gave them such parts, 
respectively, as they agreed on ; and having settled all things with 
them, and engaged them not to leave tbe place, I left them tbere.

VERSES 

SUPPOSED TO BE WRITTEN BY ALEXANDER SELKIRK, DURING HIS 
SOLITARY ABODE IN THE ISLAND OF JUAN FERNANDEZ. 

I am monarch of all I survey, 

My right there is none to dispute ; 
From the center all round to the sea 

I am lord of the fowl and the brüte. 
O, Solitude ! where are the charms 

That sages have seen in thy face ? 
Better dwell in the midst of alarms 

Than reign in this horrible place. 

I am out of humanity's reach, 

I must finish my journey alone, 
Never hear the sweet music of speech, 

I Start at the sound of my own. 
The beasts that roam over the piain 

My form with indifference see ; 
They are so unacquainted with man, 

Their tameness is shocking to me. 

Society, friendship, and love, 

Divinely bestow'd upon man, 
Oh, had I the wings of a dove, 

How soon would I taste you again ! 
My sorrows I then might assuage 

In the ways of religio n and truth, 
Might learn from the wisdom of age, 

And be cheer'd by the sallies of youth. 



246 

Religion ! what treasure untold 

Resides in that heavenly word ! 
More precious than silver or gold, 

Or all that this earth can afford. 
But the sound of the church-going bell 

These Valleys and rocks never heard, 
Ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell, 

Or smiled when a sabbath appearM. 

Ye winds, that have made me your sport, 

Convey to this desolate shore 
Some cordial, endearing report 

Of a land I shall visit no more. 
My friends, do they now and then send 

A wish or a thought after me ? 
Oh teil me I yet have a friend, 

Though a friend I am never to see. 

How fleet is the glance of the mind ! 

Compared with the speed of its flight, 
The tempest itself lags behind, 

And the swift-wing^d arrows of light. 
When I think of my own native land, 

Ina moment I seem to be there ; 
But alas ! recollection at hand 

Soon hurries me back to despair. 

But the sea-fowl has gone to her nest, 

The beast is laid down in his lair ; 
Even here is a season of rest, 

And I to my cabin repair. 
There's mercy in every place, 

And mercy. encouraging thought ! 
Gives even affliction a grace, 

And reconciles man to his lot. 



William Cowper.

Spelling Blanks 



Written spelling lessons are now almost universal in 
the best schools. Writing the spelling in blank books 
leads to neatness and accuracy of work, preserves a record 
of the progress of the pupil, and shows the words mis- 
spelled on which he should receive special drill and 
repetition. 

The use of books also avoids waste and secures uni- 
formity; the books are easily distributed and collected, 
and finally may be retained by the pupil as part of his 
record in school. 

The foUowing is a list of the best and cheapest Spell- 
ing Blanks and Tablets:

The object of McGuffey's Natural History Readers is 
to f urnish children, both at home and in school, interesting 
and instructive reading, arranged and graded for reading 
lessons. While no attempt is made to teach science, the 
descriptions of animal habits and characteristics will stimu- 
late a love of nature, and of science, the Interpreter of 
nature. 

The first book of the series coniines its subjects to 
mammals because the facts connected with this class are 
apparent and are more easily comprehended. The second 
book enters the field of the lower group of animal life, 
where the facts while more remote from ordinary view are 
even more interesting. The illustrations in both books 
are numerous and in the highest degree accurate and 
helpfuly being mostly by artists whose study and practice 
have made them specialists in particular departments of 
animal drawing.

Spencerian Vertical Penmanship 

Shorter Course, Nos. z to 7, per dozen, ... 72 cents 
Common School Course, Nos. x to 6, per dozen, 96 cents 



In this Series of Vertical Copy Books the general princi- 
ples and graceful forms which have made the Spencerian 
System of Penmanship the Standard of good writing in 
American schools have been applied to vertical writing in 
a natural and practical manner, easy to teach and to learn 
in school, and easy to apply in all kinds of social, literary 
and business writing. 

Some of the points of superiority and excellence which 
distinguish Spencerian Vertical Writing are : Its forms are 
graceful and lend themselves naturally to rapidity and 
legibility; no crude, clumsy or ill-proportioned styles of 
letters have been adopted ; the copies avoid on the one 
hand the angularity which renders writing illegible, and on 
the other, that sluggish roundness which destroys its 
beauty and makes rapidity impossible ; its use leads 
pupils to write with freedom, grace and strength, instead 
of mechanically tracing or drawing their copies. 

Since the same general principles and forms, the same 
gradation, and substaittially the same copies are employed 
as in the regulär Spencerian Copy Books, teachers and 
schools wishing to try the vertical style of writing may 
now do so under the most favorable conditions and 
with the least possible inconvenience by adopting the

Skinner's Readings in Folk-Lore 

By Hubert M. Skinner. Cloth, i2mo, 448 pp., $1.00 

In this new work the nature and value of folk-lore are 
presented in an instructive and entertaining manner, from 
the Standpoint of history, etymology, literature, and art. 
The folk-lore of each of the various nationalities is con- 
sidered separately. The selections from literature are not 
mere fragments, but each is complete in itself. 

The beautiful folk-lore of the Indians has given us Hiawatha and 
his companions, whose names have been immortalized in Longfellow's 
SoHf^ of Hiawatha. The genius of Joseph Rodman Drake peopled the 
nightly shades of the Catskills with ouphes and fays. Great Britain 
abounds in folk-lore of the highest value in its relation to literature. The 
heroes of the Norse Sagas, especially Lief Erickson and his contem- 
poraries, possess a charm for the American reader, heightened by the 
fact that it was a Norseman who, on a roving expedition, first touched 
the shores of what is now New England. The magnificent Iliad of the 
Northern Nation — The Nibelungenlied^-ha.'i been unlocked to English 
and American readers within recent years. 

From the interminable Epics of the Oriental World, Sir Edwin 
Arnold and Matthew Arnold have chosen episodes, and have added to 
English literature their strong, touching, and beautiful tales. 

Shepherd's Historical Readings 

By Henry E. Shepherd, A.M. 

Cloth, i2mo, 345 pp $1.00 

This work is adaptcd for reading and history classes in grammar 
schools, high schools, and academies. 

It includes a collection of extracts representing the purest historical 
literature that has been produced in the different stages of our literary 
development, from the time of Clarendon to the era of Macaulay and 
Prescott. There has been no attempt to preserve chronological order, 
the design of the work being to present typical illustrations of classic 
historical style, gathered mainly from English and American writers. 
The extracts are descriptive, clear, and suggestive. Many of the 
selections have never appeared in any previous historical reader.
