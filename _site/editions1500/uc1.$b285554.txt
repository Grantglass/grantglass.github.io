MEMORIAL PUBLICATION FUND
THE present volume is the first work published
by the Yale University Press on the James Wesley
Cooper Memorial Publication Fund. This Founda-
tion was established March 30th, 1918, by a gift to
Yale University from Mrs. Ellen H. Cooper in memory
of her husband, Rev. James Wesley Cooper, D. D.,
who was bom in New Haven, Connecticut, October 6,
1842, and died in New York City, March 16, 1016.
Dr. Cooper was a member of the Class of 1865, Yale
College, and for twenty-five years pastor of the South
Congregational Church of New Britain, Connecticut.
For thirty years he was a corporate member of the
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Mis-
sions and from 1885 until the time of his death was a
Fellow of Yale University, serving on the Corporation
as one of the Successors of the Original Trustees.

Publishers' Foreword
THE original work of Dr. Wobbermin was first
published in Germany in 1900, being re-
printed in 1907 and again in 1911. It was suggested
that a translation should be brought out in this
country by the Yale University Press, and the
proposal was in December, 1914, brought formally
before the Council's Committee on Publications
of Yale University for its sanction. With the ap-
proval of the Committee arrangements were there-
after entered into with Dr. Daniel S. Robinson
now Acting Chaplain, U. S. N., for the preparation
of an American edition. The publication just at
this time of his translation of Dr. Wobbermin's
work seems especially significant since it presents
to our people a careful analysis and incisive criti-
cism by a German of that modernized form of
German materialism and evolutionism expounded
by such writers as Nietzsche and Haeckel. It has
been felt by the publishers that it was desirable to
make available this criticism by a German of Ger-
man materialistic philosophy for the benefit of
English-speaking people who seek to acquaint
themselves with, even if they find it impossible to
understand, the dominant thought of modern
Germany.

Translator's Preface
IN such a calamitous time as this, when the
question is quite generally being asked "Can
any good thing come out of Germany?" it is with
considerable trepidation that I venture to offer to
the public a translation of a German book on the
philosophy of religion. I am convinced, however,
that any reader who may pick up this book with
this sceptical attitude, will lay it down—if he will
but carefully and thoughtfully read it through—
with the consciousness that he has been guided
through a most interesting mass of facts and the-
ories by a thinker of the first rank.
Dr. Wobbermin needs no introduction to stu-
dents of systematic theology and the philosophy of
religion. It is generally known in theological circles
that he delivered, in 1907, the Nathaniel William
Taylor lectures at Yale University, and that one
of these lectures was published shortly afterward
in the Yale " Divinity Quarterly." That is all that
has hitherto appeared in English from his pen.
But in Germany he is known as the author of many
important contributions to the history, as well as
to the psychology and the philosophy of religion.
His influence in German theology has grown until
he stands today second to none among systematic
theologians. It may be of interest to some to learn
xiii
that it was Dr. Wobbermin who translated into
German William James' "Varieties of Religious
Experience," and that he has been considerably
influenced by James, although much more by
Schleiermacher and Ritschl in theology, and by
Kant in epistemology. He was recently transferred
from the University of Breslau to that of Heidel-
berg.
I trust that readers of this translation may be
induced to read other of Dr. Wobbermin's writings.
His "Theologie und Metaphysik," "Systematische
Theologie," (of which only one volume has so far
appeared) and his " Monismus und Monotheismus"
are especially valuable. I have appended to the
notes at the end of the book a list of the books by
Dr. Wobbermin published by J. C. Hinrichs and
Company, of Leipzig, in appreciation of their hav-
ing given me the English rights on this book. How-
ever, this is not a complete bibliography of Dr.
Wobbermin's writings, since some of his books
have been published by other firms.
This translation was completed and was accepted
for publication several months ago. In fact, the
work was practically completed at the outbreak
of the world-war. Quite recently, however, the
text has been carefully revised. In making this
revision I was fortunate in securing the valuable
assistance of Dr. Franz J. Dohmen, of Cambridge,
Mass., who made a minute comparison of my
translation with the original, and provided me with
an alternative rendering. The translation as it now
xiv
stands embodies most of his changes. His thor-
ough familiarity with both languages made it pos-
sible for him to correct many errors into which I
had been led, and I am greatly indebted to him for
making it possible for me to offer a much more
accurate rendition than I could have done had I
published my original translation. However, I
have been guided throughout by the desire to make
the book read like English rather than by the de-
sire to be slavishly true to the original.
I am also indebted to Professor Douglas Clyde
Macintosh for valuable assistance and encourage-
ment, and to Dr. Wobbermin for having read my
manuscript and for giving many helpful suggestions.

Preface to the Third German
Edition
THIS little book seems to have met the modest
purpose for which it was intended. The text
remains unaltered in this third edition, but the
notes and references have been revised and
made more complete. In doing this I have kept
strictly to my original intention that this booklet
should serve simply as an orientation and as a
guide to further study.
For a fuller discussion of the thoughts expressed
in this book, I refer to my recently published
"Monismus and Monotheismus, Vortrage und
Abhandlungen zum Kampf um die monistische
Weltanschauung," Tubingen, i911.

Chapter One
The Chief Tendencies of Present-Day
Philosophy and Its Relation e© Modern
Natural Science
-L philosopher of our day, has somewhere said
that all systematizers should be distrusted and
shunned, inasmuch as the will to systematize in-
dicates a lack of integrity.*
Nietzsche's own works, with their brilliant epi-
grams, aphoristic in form and too often mutually
contradictory, are indeed a model of absolute lack
of system. Now it must be frankly conceded, so
it seems to me, that the systems of human opinions
and world-views, from the most ancient down to
the most modern, and the purely philosophical
no less than the theological, give this great scoffer
sufficient occasion for this epigram. For they
often resemble the work of the spider, who spins
his ingenious web entirely from himself. But on
the other hand, systematic completeness belongs
necessarily to every genuine philosophy in the
sense that such a philosophy must proceed from a
permanent, well-founded position, and from that

the fashionable

seek to win a unified, harmonious view of things
and of life.
Both are, however, completely lacking in
Nietzsche. Hence, in the proper meaning of the
word he cannot even be considered a philosopher,
to say nothing of his being taken as a representa-
tive of current philosophy. To be sure Nietzsche
*6presen.ts: flonklernness in a certain sense; modern
life,t the'stirrings and moods of the modern mind—
.itsl.Ujicestj its .disjQintedness, and its distraction.
But precisely the most important characteristics
of modern philosophy as modern are lacking in
his works, the most important because they relate
to the starting point and to the method of philoso-
phizing. These characteristics are, to mention
them here at the outset, empirical knowledge as
the starting point, and critical thought as the
method. Indeed with Nietzsche the lack of founda-
tion and of system is so great that, taken as a
whole, his doctrines and his world-view are equally
as fanciful and capricious as cob-web systems.
This is especially and quite manifestly true of
his doctrine of the eternal recurrence of all things *
one of the two ideas really and steadily maintained
by Nietzsche from their first conception. This
theory, at least in the application which he makes
of it and for which it is of consequence to him, is
* This conception is found for the first time in the "Frohliche
Wissenschaft," which appeared in 1882. The same idea dominates
the Zarathustra Schriften, and plays an important part in the
posthumous works.
Chapter I—Tendencies
the purest mythology. The supposition that
everyone must live over again the life he is now
living, and that this is to happen a countless num-
ber of times—this new and unfruitful form of
belief in immortality which Nietzsche sets over
against the Christian belief, is, as I said, for present-
day thought, the purest mythology; for it has
neither a theoretical nor a practical basis, nor is
one led to it either by theoretical or by practical
motives. Among the Babylonians, the Pytha-
goreans and the Stoics this belief at least had a
proper meaning, but no such connotation belongs
to it to-day.
Nor is it very different with the other underlying
and basic thought of Nietzsche, his cardinal and
most unique underlying conception, namely, that
of the necessity of a re-evaluation of all values, the
necessity of substituting for the stupifying slave
morality of sympathy the master morality which
alone promotes culture, a morality of reckless self-
assertion and self-indulgence. Here he has at
least attempted to give a real demonstration,
which is to be found in the " Genealogy of Morals,"
the only one of his so-called philosophical writings
which might lay any claim to being scientific and
philosophic. Nevertheless this attempt to give a
historical or historico-philosophical basis to the
doctrine of "double morality" fails completely.
Instead of being historical it is in the highest degree
unhistorical—a poetical, fanciful conception, or bet-
ter, construction. The real historical development
3
of moral ideas, that is to say, of moral norms and
values, cannot be fitted into the scheme of master
and slave morality. Moreover, Christian morality,
however much it desires to be and is universally
humane, is not a slave morality in Nietzsche's
sense of demanding that all men be treated and
valued as absolutely equal. Beyond doubt the
kernel of truth in Nietzsche's thought lies in his
emphasis upon independence and the intrinsic
value of the strong-willed personality. But on
the other hand, unless we would drive this prin-
ciple at once to extremes, we must not use it as
an argument against Christian morality itself, but
only to correct a pietistic limitation of Christian
morality. Even so proud an utterance as that of
Zarathustra: "And verily there came to me many
a chance imperiously, but even more imperiously
my will spake to it, and forthwith it lay upon its
knees imploring mercy," are so little in contradic-
tion with the Gospel that, apart from the ambiguity
of the word "chance," it expresses one and only
one of the fundamental moods of the Bible. Think,
for example, of the story of the temptation.
In discussing these two fundamental conceptions
I have already criticised the doctrine of the super-
man which Nietzsche builds upon these two pillars.
He is the superman who exalts himself above the
crowd, who exalts himself, indeed, above the limita-
tions of humanity itself. Therefore the morality
of mankind is not applicable to him, but only that
exceptional morality which Nietzsche designates
4
master morality. Only the superman can endure
the thought of an eternal recurrence. Hence it is
precisely this belief in the eternal recurrence which
overcomes humanity and breeds the superman.
Consequently this idea of the superman is a fic-
tion which entirely disregards experience. Indeed
its supposition of the possibility of a breeding
of the superman even directly contradicts ex-
perience.
Nietzsche intends this belief in the superman to
supplant belief in God. "Dead are all the Gods:
now do we desire the superman to live. Let this
be our final will at the great noontide! Thus spake
Zarathustra." "Before God we are all equal, (so
the populace blink). Before God!—Now, however,
this God hath died. Ye higher men, this God was
your greatest danger. Only since he lay in the grave
have ye again risen. Now only cometh the great
noon-tide. Now only doth the higher man be-
come—master! God hath died, now do we desire
the superman to live.'' *
As a matter of fact this conception of the super-
man is even with Nietzsche manifoldly iridescent
and often reshaped. Indeed he himself did not
maintain it to the end. Hence what has been said
may suffice to justify passing on over Nietzsche
and his steadily growing animosity to the Christian
belief in God, which in his later works already
presages insanity. This belief he finally character-
ized as the one great spiritual perversity, the one

ineffaceable blemish of humanity.* To be sure,
disciples have gathered around the name of
Nietzsche. Yes, a Nietzsche cult has sprung into
existence! But the movement seems to be ebbing
away even now, and there can be no doubt but
that the waters will soon subside entirely of them-
selves. A serious and thorough argument with
Nietzsche over belief in God is neither possible nor
necessary. His own words are valid against him-
self: "This thinker needs no one to refute him
because he does that sufficiently himself." A de-
bate with his so-called disciples is even less neces-
sary, since, almost without exception, they either
fail to understand their master at all, or else they
do not rightly interpret him.
This does not mean, however, that the work of
Nietzsche is entirely fruitless and valueless for
religious thought and belief in God. On the con-
trary it is possible for it to become exceptionally
productive for such a purpose. For upon close
examination it will be found that motives of a reli-
gious nature are by no means lacking in Nietz-
sche's own thinking. But these genuine religious
motives are, as a rule, either subsequently violently
and artificially distorted, or else they lose their
proper meaning. For example I need only to refer
to the well-known verse in the famous "Midnight
Song," which friends and admirers have had
chiseled upon the memorial stone on the shore of
Lake Silser, in the Upper Engadine:
* WW. VII., p. 186 (Antichrist).

"Oman! Take heed!
What saith deep midnight's voice indeed?
'I slept my sleep—
'From deepest dream I've woke and plead:—
'The world is deep,
'And deeper than the day could read.
'Deep is its woe—
'Joy—deeper still than grief can be:
'Woe saith: Hence! Go!
'But joys all want eternity—
'Want deep profound eternity!'" *
Anyone having anything like a fine appreciation
of the religious life will at once recognize the point
of relation between the feeling expressed in this
verse and belief in God. Nor is it merely a relation
of remote analogy, indeed it is exactly the most
significant psychological fundamental motives and
fountain heads of religion which are involved.
"The world is deep,
And deeper than the day could read."
This implies that the meaning and import of the
world which surrounds us, and in which we live,
* I have taken this from the English translation of the works of
Nietzsche. Vol. II, p. 279. Here is the original (WW. VI,
P. 332):
O Mensch! Gib acht!
Was spricht die tiefe Mitternacht?
Ich schlief, ich schlief—•,
Aus tiefem Traum bin ich erwacht:—
Die Welt ist tief,
Und tiefer als der Tag gedacht.
Tief ist ihr Weh—,
Lust—tiefer noch als Herzeleid:
Weh spricht: Vergeh,
Doch alle Lust will Ewigkeit!
Will tiefe, tiefe Ewigkeit! Tr.

is not to be fathomed by superficial reflection. And
that means, in the first place, that the world has a
meaning. It is not meaningless, purposeless and
aimless. Consequently, realizing or at least divin-
ing this, we may neither look upon nor conduct our
life aimlessly and as though it were meaningless.
And, in the second place, it means that only he who
bores into the depths will be able to comprehend
this meaning, for, as a matter of fact, it does not
lie in that which presents itself immediately and
passively to the senses. It is upon this conviction
that religion bases its faith in a world or sphere of
life of the "beyond," a world which is designated
or conceived as "beyond," first, because, as is as-
serted, in its nature and import it extends beyond
the whole world of sense and phenomena (because
it is deeper, or, to use a word which expresses the
same thing under a different figure, higher than
this); and second, because the phenomenal world
receives meaning only by being brought into re-
lation to the world of the "beyond."
And again:
"Joy—deeper still than grief can be:
Woe saith: Hence 1 Go!
But joys all want eternity—
Want deep profound eternity!"
Such an ardent longing for eternity, for the values
and realities of eternity over against the transitori-
ness of all manifestations and achievements of the
world of sense is another fundamental motive of re-
ligion. And this is in closest accord with the dis-
8
cussion above. The same thought is expressed in
the hymn:
O Ewigkeit, du schone,
Mein Herz an dich gewBhne,
Mein Heim ist nicht in dieser Zeit. (Tersteegen.)*
From this the desire is born in religion to subor-
dinate everything of "this world" to the "world
beyond." To use the language of Schleiermacher,
it is the desire "to become one with the infinite
while still in the finite and eternal at once." Of
course the meaning of the words eternal and eter-
nity in religious usage, especially in that of the
Christian religion, is altogether different from that
ordinarily connected with the words. Indeed, the
quotation just given from the Christian author
shows that very clearly. As interpreted by the
Christian belief in God eternity does not mean
simply the endlessness of time, and not, therefore,
the passing of time. Indeed, if we seek an under-
standing of the word eternity from the psychological
approach, it stands in contrast with the temporal
as such and means the surmounting of everything
temporal and ephemeral—of all changing finite
existence. And Nietzsche's "Midnight Song"
shows that he comprehended, at least in a measure,
this turn and interpretation of the word. His more
specific characterizations of eternity testify to
this—"deep, profound eternity," for it must be
noted that the word deep here is manifestly in-
* O Eternity, Thou beautiful, my heart lives in thee, my home
is not in time.
9
tended to connect with and to recall the thought
expressed in the preceding sentence—"the world
is deep." But it is precisely this connection which
is significant and conclusive for the religious con-
sciousness. For eternity, in the sense in which the
word is used in the Christian religion, signifies pre-
cisely the eternal and profound substance of cosmic
and of human history—its eternal foundation in
God and its eternal relationship to God.
Finally, therefore, these lines of Nietzsche lead
to genuine religious optimism; not a powerless
optimism which dreams itself away unaffected by
the tribulations and contradictions of life, but a
higher, courageous, strong-willed optimism which
abides in spite of all adversity and suffering in its
"nevertheless"
"Joy—deeper still than grief can be."
For the ultimate and deepest meaning of the world
does not lie in sorrow but only in joy; not in the
depreciation and negation of life, but in its affirma-
tion, enrichment and elevation. Imbued with
such optimism the Apostle Paul said: "For our light
affliction which is for the moment, worketh for us
more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of
glory, while we look not at the things which are
seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the
things which are seen are temporal, but the things
which are not seen are eternal." II Cor. 4, 17f.
All of these thoughts, which spring from the
depths of the human spirit, and which are from
10
their very conception intrinsically related with one
another, are in the Christian belief in God con-
sistently welded in the conviction that the phe-
nomenal world, presenting itself to us to begin
with, and our own life in it, are not ultimate, not
an end and goal in themselves, but rather, that
they have the ground and purpose for their exist-
ence in a deeper or higher world—the world of
God; and that it is only through reference to his
eternal being and to the eternal essence of his
Kingdom that God gives meaning and purpose to
this phenomenal world of ours, supporting and
actively permeating it. Thus the destiny and goal
of human life is to grow beyond itself, and into
fellowship with God.
When once these feeling and thought motives so
strongly attested by Nietzsche are recognized as
valid and as pointing in the right direction, they
can be united with the Christian belief in God and
its ideal of fellowship with God. For this would
be incomparably more natural and satisfactory than
the interpretation of these motives of Nietzsche
to favor the theories of the superman and the eter-
nal recurrence of all things. For critically consid-
ered these theories contradict and annul one an-
other. For when the doctrine of the eternal and
inevitable recurrence of all things (alles Werdens
und Geschehens) is taken seriously there can be no
final goal. Moreover, strictly speaking, the super-
man cannot be the goal of evolution, for even the
very idea of a development toward an end must
1i
be unconditionally rejected. Indeed Nietzsche
himself occasionally demanded this.* Yet this
idea is the real motive of the whole doctrine of the
superman!1
But if Nietzsche cannot be considered a repre-
sentative of present-day philosophy who can be
so considered? Another name might be mentioned,
and certainly with greater justification than that
of Nietzsche—the name of Richard Avenarius
(died 1896). He was the founder of what he called
the empirio-critical philosophy or the philosophy
of pure experience, and he was at one with Nietzsche
in radical warfare against all forms of belief in God.
But the philosophy of Avenarius is a polar opposite
to that of Nietzsche. For he emphasizes empiri-
cism—the actual reality—as the starting point of
philosophizing, and demands just as emphatically
the critical method (which is the real scientific
method) for this philosophizing. Hence it is pos-
sible to examine the philosophy of Avenarius criti-
cally and in detail. Consequently it is not sur-
prising that he has found adherents in considerable
numbers among the younger generation of philos-
ophers. In the "Vierteljahrsschrift fur wissen-
schaftliche Philosophic" this school possesses its
own organ which is thoroughly modern. And in
the discussion of philosophical problems this school
has undertaken the extremely important task of
bringing about a union and free interplay of ideas
between philosophy and the exact sciences. Never-
*WW. XII, pp. 51 ff.

theless I can briefly dispose of this philosophy of
pure experience. For while it may in fact be called
the most characteristic phase of present-day scien-
tific philosophy, yet it does not represent that
philosophy with which we are concerned, be it
as a dangerous opponent or as a welcome ally of the
Christian belief in God. For the present this philos-
ophy will not exercise a wide-spread influence, at
least not in the form in which it has thus far been
expounded. Neither the chief work of Avenarius
himself—his voluminous "Kritik der reinen Erfah-
rung," intentionally so entitled to pattern after
Kant's "Kritik der reinen Vernunft"—nor the
works written by his pupils, among whom Willy
and Petzoldt are the most representative, will be
very influential. The highly complex terminology
with which these works are set forth, and which
requires study in itself, will prevent that. If
Nietzsche attaches so much value to the linguistic
terms, to the style and literary form, that the real
philosophic interest stands in the background, the
opposite extreme is found in the empirio-critical
philosophy. Here there is a neglect of the art of
expression that greatly impedes the understanding.
The basic thesis of this philosophy, from which
radical warfare against belief in God in any form
at once follows, is the systematic rejection of the
distinction between inner and outer experience.
According to Avenarius this distinction, and the
consequent assertion of a special inner experience
along side of the outer, has heretofore been the
13
great and fundamental falsehood and self-deception
of all methods of thought. He thinks that this
distinction is entirely uncritical, and that it is
directly connected with the naive, animistic con-
ceptions which we find in children and uncivilized
peoples, who transfer their psychical experiences
to all objects perceived by them, thinking all of
them animated, and thus finally set up a re-
duplication of the whole conception of the world.
Just as the doll or flying dragon is to the child not
merely the particular thing of this or that kind, but
at the same time the home and abode of some sort
of special capabilities and powers, so every distinc-
tion between inner and outer experience is claimed
to rest upon a similar unwarranted reduplication
of the given facts. Thus, then, belief in God would
be proved a pure illusion, being rooted, and indeed
admittedly so, in the inner experience pure and
simple, even though the attempt be perhaps sub-
sequently made of establishing it from outer ex-
perience.
This argument, however, undoubtedly rests upon
serious epistemological and psychological errors.
The distinction between inner and outer experience
is warranted, indeed it is necessary, for it follows
naturally and imperatively from the nature of the
human psychical life. Our mind, or to put it dif-
ferently, the content of our consciousness, and
that is the only thing which is direct and immediate
for us, is essentially of a dual nature. On the one
hand, it consists of sense-mediated representations
14
which point to material things external to us, and
which present themselves with the claim of being
images of these material things. But on the other
hand, this content of consciousness is made up of
a great variety of will-tensions (Willensspannun-
gen) and impulses of feeling. The latter are dis-
tinguished from the former just in this, that they
do not, at least not directly and primarily, refer
to things in the outer world, but that, on the con-
trary, they merely express our own inner life. Sub-
sequently, to be sure, these will-tensions and feeling
impulses often give the mind occasion for assuming
objects (still other objects than those mediated by
the senses) as really existing in the outer world.
Avenarius suppresses entirely the latter part of
this duality, namely, the fact of will-tensions and
feeling impulses. At any rate he suppresses it in
his first formulation, but that is just where it would
be of decisive significance. Later he gives this fact
some consideration, but not until he has reached a
point where it can no longer injure his theory—an
artifice that is much favored and often used by
systematizers. Only in this way are Avenarius and
his disciples able to establish the fundamental
thesis of their philosophy, a thesis which, from the
outset, takes away the very basis of faith in God.
The faultiness of this thesis is merely concealed by
the mass of difficult and complex discussion of
details. But the fundamental distinction between
inner and outer experience remains valid, no mat-
ter how their relation to one another may be de-
15'
fined, for this may certainly be done in various
ways.
Here, therefore, I shall not enter into a more
detailed discussion of the philosophy of pure ex-
perience. In reference to it I shall only mention
what seems to me the point really worthy of at-
tention, namely, that here the attempt is made to
make higher mathematics and biology fruitful for
philosophic reflection. This attempt has been
made by quite a number of other philosophers of
our day, but nowhere with the same vigor, and in
the same methodical and systematic manner as
here.2 Indeed I consider this to be a real service.
For it seems to me that the methods and results of
both of these disciplines must play an important
r6le in all future attempts at systematizing, be
they theological or purely philosophical. Within
the scope of these lectures my further discussion
will substantiate this opinion.
So then, neither Nietzsche nor Avenarius can be
considered representatives of present-day philos-
ophy. But then there seem to remain a vast throng
of heterogeneous thinkers whom we must now
consider. For the saying'' there are as many philos-
ophies as philosophers," which might be thought
true with reference to philosophy in general, holds
with special force at the present time. Indeed this
is not merely a semblance. Just at present all
matters in philosophy are actually in a state of
flux. The fields of epistemology and psychology of
the senses show a certain exception, but even of
16
them this is true only with important restrictions.
And, while these disciplines are undoubtedly the
foundations proper of present-day philosophy, yet
they only interest us here indirectly. But when
we inquire for the complete philosophical world-
view, with whose bearing on the Christian belief in
God we are concerned, we find a motley col-
lection.
When examined more closely, however, the
seemingly inextricable thicket clears to a certain
extent before the more penetrating investigation.
Certain perspectives and lines of procedure are
disclosed which do not, to be sure, point to a
uniquely determined conclusion, but which do,
nevertheless, indicate a goal lying within definite
limits.
Two such general lines of development appear
to me to be especially characteristic and determin-
ing for present-day philosophy. One is the return
to Kant, especially to his epistemology; and the
other is the concept of evolution, or, more generally
expressed, evolutionary thought.
Indeed it might be held that both of these
movements are reducible to one, namely, the first,
because as a matter of fact the concept of evolu-
tion is itself both directly and indirectly dependent
upon Kant. It is dependent upon him directly in
so far as the present doctrine of evolution, that is
to say, the doctrine of the gradual origin of life
and of the gradual development of living organisms,
can consistently be expanded into a general theory

of cosmic evolution. For the latter was first scien-
tifically established in the Kant-Laplacian nebular
theory. This theory deduces the origin and motions
of the various heavenly bodies from the rotation
of a general and chaotic primordial nebula.* In-
deed on various occasions Kant developed almost
a complete program of the doctrine of evolution.
This is to be found especially in paragraph eighty
of his "Kritik der Urteilskraft" 3—a paragraph
often neglected. Moreover, for his ultimate world-
view as a whole, transcending all particularities of
his system, Kant gave a far reaching importance
to the principle of evolution directed teleologically,
that is, to the idea of a general ascending develop-
ment toward an end. This has often been entirely
overlooked, or, at least under-valued in its signifi-
cance to Kant's work as a whole. For this he him-
self was partly responsible in that he did not ex-
plicitly emphasize this line of thought, but rather
introduced it incidentally and took it as a matter
of course. But nevertheless it is there, and it is
by no means merely incidental to the whole of
* Kant developed this theory in a work which appeared in 1755
entitled "Allgemeine-Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Him-
mels," to which he gave the sub-title: "An essay on the constitu-
tion and mechanical origin of the whole cosmic system, based
upon Newtonian principles." Essentially the same thoughts
were soon after put forth by the French mathematician, Laplace.
It was especially the English astronomer, Herschel, who brought
this theory to the widest acceptance. Today the theory by no
means passes uncontested, indeed it is open to many objections
in its details, but its underlying principle—the conception of
a cosmic evolution—is generally accepted.

his system—to the final collected result of his re-
flections. The ethico-theological and the historico-
philosophical views of Kant are united with his
teleological conception of nature in the hypothesis
of a consistent evolution of the world, comprising
all being and all phenomena, the physical and the
ethical alike.4 And this leads to the indirect de-
pendence of the concept of evolution upon Kant to
which attention must be called. For the modern
conception of evolution is indirectly dependent
upon Kant in so far as the idealistic speculative
philosophy, which took up Kant's ideas, but which,
to be sure, afterwards completely abandoned his
critical position in very important and decisive
points, has, through the very fact of taking up,
developing, and completing Kant's ideas of evolu-
tion, helped to bring about the dominance of the
modern conception of evolution.
While this must not be overlooked, it is neverthe-
less true that the conception of evolution gained
the general acceptance and fundamental impor-
tance which attach to it today only through modern
natural science. We must therefore admit that
these two lines of development are independent
and parallel. According as to whether one or the
other predominates, and according to the measure
of the predominance of the one over the other, we
get different groups of philosophers and of philo-
sophical world-views.
It suits my purpose best to distinguish three such
groups, which may be considered chief groups.
19
I. = The Positivistic Philosophy.
II. = The Materialistic-Naturalistic Philosophy.
III. = The Idealistic Philosophy.
Each of these groups contains a variety of shades
and gradations which must be differentiated under
varying points of view, and must be brought into
relation with one another. But these three ten-
dencies and groups are nevertheless the most essen-
tial ones for my purpose, which is concerned with
the relation of present-day philosophy to religion—
in particular to the Christian belief in God.
They are comprehensible in their heterogeneity
through the historical development of philosophy
in the last half century.
Before the rigorous, systematic development
of the exact sciences, (for which the eighteenth
century prepared the way, but which has only been
systematically carried out since the middle of the
last century), philosophy had been considered the
fundamental science and the mother of all the
sciences. The exact sciences were in a relation of
complete dependence upon it. They permitted it
to prescribe the ends to be attained by their work,
in most cases even to give them their results in
advance—at least just the decisive and final results.
Although Kant's epistemology should have put a
stop to this procedure and attitude, philosophy
nevertheless once more put forth its utmost exer-
tions in this direction in the very years after Kant.
Leaving all experience out of the question, philos-
ophy attempted, purely from the reason, from
20
certain so-called highest rational ideas, arbitrarily
to construct the whole of reality. All contrary
empirical knowledge and the results of investigation
were either ignored or forced into the system.
Never before had this been attempted in such a
comprehensive manner and on such broad lines as
in the systems of the speculative philosophers of
the first half of the nineteenth century, namely,
those of Fichte, Schelling and Hegel. But philos-
ophy had gone too far in its demands and had over-
estimated its powers. An Icharus-flight to the sun
had been attempted and the headlong plunge to
earth was inevitable. In fact, even before the
middle of the century a reaction set in against the
esteem in which philosophy had been held such as
history had never before known. Though it had
only yesterday reigned supreme over all human
knowledge and thinking philosophy now suddenly
became valueless. It was thought for a time that
philosophy, which had come to be regarded as mere
abstract speculation, had been demonstrated to be
mere pseudo-science. It was thought that only
experimental science should be considered real
science, and that seriously minded men should no
longer have anything to do with philosophy.
Of course this was to throw away the wheat with
the chaff. In the first place it had been overlooked
that the exact or experimental sciences work with
definite hypotheses, habits and methods of thought
without being able to test their justification or
validity. For example take the hypothesis of
21
causality. Generally speaking is it valid at all?
If so, why, how and how far is it valid? And if
we find that certain habits of thought appear as
norms of thought which are the basis of all think-
ing and knowing, does it not follow that these norms
help to determine the whole of our knowledge, and
that knowledge is by no means grounded in mere
experience? Kant's epistemology had already set
in just at this point. Hence a return to Kant, and
therewith to a certain measure of philosophic re-
flection, was soon seen to be necessary. The funda-
mental principles and rules common to all scientific
thinking, and inherent in empirical knowledge,
cannot be sufficiently analysed and criticised by
any single empirical or experimental science. That
can only, and must of necessity, be done by philos-
ophy, reflecting upon the sum total of empirical
knowledge as well as upon all human thinking and
knowing. In other words, in the form of logic,
epistemology and methodology philosophy is in any
case indispensable, and as such it is necessary for
the pursuit of the exact sciences.
This field of work was, in fact, the first to be
won back for philosophy. But, quite naturally, it
was frequently demanded that philosophy be un-
conditionally limited to this task as a matter of
principle. At most, it would be conceded, the
field of ethics, like logic itself, might be treated
according to purely logical principles. As for the
rest, philosophy was to confine itself strictly to
the analysis of positive knowledge. This is the
22
positivistic school of modern philosophy. It gets
its name from a work written by the French philos-
opher, Auguste Comte (1798-1857), entitled "Cours
de philosophic positive." This school has found
eminent and acute exponents in Germany among
the so-called Neo-Kantians. These men have
rendered the great service of having again paved
the way for philosophic reflection. They have
also had a significant part in reviving the study of
Kant.
Cohen and Natorp belong to this school, the
former being well known because of his penetrating
studies in the philosophy of Kant, the latter es-
pecially by his pedagogical publications.5 Ernst
Mach of Vienna, originally physicist, later philos-
opher, also belongs here; though he is not affected
by a strong Kantian influence.6 But there are
many points of contact between Mach and the
school of the so-called immanence philosophy, rep-
resented by Schuppe, Rehmke, and others.7 The
empirio-critical philosophy, which was discussed
above, tried to push to its logical conclusion the
view represented by Mach on the one hand and
on the other hand by the immanence philosophy.
Liebmann of Jena (died 1911) and Alois Riehl
of Berlin are usually classed with the Neo-Kantians
and therefore as positivistic philosophers. But
although they started from strict positivism they
have gradually left that position and are more
properly classed with the third group.8
Now arises the further question as to whether
23
another line of problems does not properly fall
within the domain of philosophy. Since the exact
sciences often lead to results with bearings beyond
their scope (even when looked upon as infinite
processes), results which make it imperative to
establish a connection between them and the prob-
lems and results of other sciences, it is obvious that
no one of these branches of science can, with pros-
pect of success, undertake this comprehensive
task, which includes the whole of human knowledge
and thought. Here too, on the contrary, progress
can be made only through general philosophic
reflection. Philosophy must supply the super-
structure as well as the foundation for the various
fields of knowledge and investigation.
Still other more important considerations point
in the same direction. For if norms of thought
have the great significance for human knowledge
which we have claimed for them above, they will
point the way to final, absolute truth. This is at
least true if it is not merely a question of norms
of thought for particular, single individuals, but
on the contrary such as are valid, so far as we may
Christian Belief in God
not merely for the particular individual's con-
sciousness but, so to speak, for the race conscious-
ness of humanity. And again, further than this,
what is valid of these norms of thought will also be
valid of the other spiritual and mental potential-
ities of mankind—the religious, the ethical, and
the aesthetical potentialities—in so far as they
24
are shown to be necessary presuppositions for a
normal participation in the sphere of life which
is in question.
Thus philosophic reflection finds the greatest
variety of opportunities for striving to go beyond
the separate spheres of the exact sciences, and to
approach final truth without running the risk of
becoming mere speculation and arbitrary con-
struction.
Among recent philosophers those who felt that
they could not be satisfied with the strictly pos-
itivistic point of view as final have defined their
task in this sense. But they are distinguished from
the purely speculative thinkers of the Schelling-
Hegel type by two fundamental characteristics.
First, they do not ignore or disregard the exact
sciences and empirical knowledge, but on the con-
trary they presuppose this empirical knowledge as a
necessary basis. Second, in accordance with this,
they do not claim absolute validity for what they
assert, but hold it subject to the unceasing check
and criticism of wider experience.
Fechner (died 1887) and Friedrich Paulsen (died
1908) so defined the task and working methods of
modern metaphysics—for thus this second field
of philosophy is designated. But metaphysics as
here defined is not absolutistic and deductive, but
inductive and conscious of its limitations and its
provisional character.
But on the basis of such principles the problem
may still be dealt with in two very different ways,
25
according to whether the phenomena of nature and
their interpretations are taken exclusively or at
least preferably, as the starting point and basis
for philosophic reflection, or whether the spiritual
life and its history are also taken into account.
In the first case we get a materialistic-naturalistic
and in the second an idealistic philosophy.
From this it follows at once that the idealistic
philosophy will be the only one capable of taking
into account not merely positive knowledge and the
results of investigation, but also those inner guides
which are to be found in the religious, the ethical
and the sesthetical consciousness, as well as in
thought. But idealistic philosophy in its turn will
exhibit highly significant differences according to
the manner in which and the extent to which these
inner guides are brought into play.
Ernst Haeckel, the zoologist of Jena, is today the
chief representative of a materialistic-naturalistic
philosophy and world-view. He is often mentioned
of late on account of his "Riddle of the Universe,"
a book which has a distinct bias, and which, in the
historical part, is filled with mistakes and mis-
understandings of the worst sort. However Haeckel
undeniably deserves credit for his work in applying
the doctrine of evolution to the organic world,
which he carried out with a certain intuitive orig-
inality. But even within the domain of his own
specific science he is not free from diverse exaggera-
tions and premature conclusions, and hence he is
to blame for the fact that very recently some nat-
26
ural scientists have, in contrast with him, returned
to a one-sided and radical rejection of the whole
doctrine of evolution.9
Next to Haeckel I place Wilhelm Roux, founder
of the so-called theory of mechanical evolution.
He has had a great influence among physicians
and natural scientists in the dissemination of a
mechanical world-view. Compared with Haeckel's
his work is thoroughly scientific and reliable.10 I
also mention here some other natural scientists
because they have worked on the doctrine of evolu-
tion and its application, although they have not
definitely stated their position on the really phil-
osophical questions, namely:
Weismann, biologist of Freiburg, who has devel-
oped the Darwinian theory most consequentially,11
N'ageli, formerly botanist in Munich,12 and De
Vries, botanist, important on account of his so-
called theory of mutation, a significant modifica-
tion of and supplement to the theory of Darwin.13
In contrast to these there are some contem-
porary natural scientists who have taken a de-
cided interest in philosophical problems, namely:
Ostwald of Leipzig, the most zealous advocate at
present of a philosophy based on natural science,
and editor of the "Annalen der Naturphiloso-
phie," 14 Driesch, of Heidelberg, the champion of
the so-called neo-vitalism,15 and Reinke, botanist
in Kiel, who in recent years has expressed himself
on several occasions very emphatically to the
effect that it is unjustifiable to draw materialistic-
27
atheistic conclusions from the achievements of
modern natural science.16
The representatives of idealistic philosophy,
especially important from our point of view, are
the following:
Von Hartmann. He is well known as the phil-
osopher of the unconscious. Among his followers
Arthur Drews, of Karlsruhe, is especially prom-
inent by reason of his acumen and scholarship.
He has attempted to harmonize the philosophy of
von Hartmann with recent scientific and philosoph-
ical principles and results, and he has directed his
attention especially to the problem of the relation
of the philosophical to the theological world-view.17
Baumann, of Gottingen, has attempted to estab-
lish ethical and religious ideas on the basis of the
exact sciences.18
Hqffding, of Copenhagen, well known for his
ethical and psychological works.19
Wundt, the well-known psychologist and founder
of the "Psychological Institute" at Leipzig, in ad-
dition to his exact psychological investigations has
never ceased to be interested in the fundamental
problems of all the philosophical disciplines. Among
his numerous pupils Oswald Kiilpe must be espe-
cially mentioned.20
Paulsen (see above), apart from his philosophical
works, is especially important for us because of his
having brought out clearly and emphatically the
connection between Kant's philosophical mode of
thinking and the spirit of Protestantism.21
28
William James.22 Not only are Wundt and
Paulsen closely related to one another but they are'
both similar to James, the three being the chief
representatives of voluntarism—the philosophy of
will. Wundt and Paulsen are also closely related
on the other hand to Fechner, the founder of
psycho-physics.23
Eucken, of Jena, has laid great stress on the duty
of philosophy to take a definite stand in the fight
for religion.24
Wilhelm Dilthey (died 1911), must be credited
with having set forth most convincingly the dis-
tinctive character and the independence of the
mental and moral sciences in contrast with the
natural sciences, and with having brought about
the general acceptance of this contrast. At the
same time, he has taught us to take into account
the facts of the religious life, and has thrown light
upon its problems. We are indebted to him for
the best work on Schleiermacher. Finally he
advocates the "Idealism of Freedom," as exhibited
in the Christian religion and the philosophy of
Kant, as one of the possible world-views.
Besides Dilthey, especially Windelband of Hei-
delberg (died 1916) and Rickert of Freiberg are
striving to establish a philosophy of history and
culture.26
Herbert Spencer (died 1903), the most important
English philosopher of the nineteenth century,
endeavored to bring together the three principal
trends of modern philosophy mentioned above.26
29
For our purposes these are the most important
representatives of the philosophy which, in the
narrowest sense of the word, may be designated
modern philosophy. But the Hegelian philosophy
still has its advocates. They have rendered a most
valuable service in keeping before the present gen-
eration the tenable features of that earlier epoch.
Because of his acumen and breadth of insight,
Adolph Lasson, of Berlin, ranks first among these
Hegelians.
It is of course impossible for me to expound
singly here the positions of these various thinkers
toward the Christian belief in God. I shall, there-
fore, select only such of them as are important in
any particular connection, considering them in
larger or smaller groups according to circumstances,
or, when necessary, referring to a particular one of
them.
3°
Epistemology and the Christian Belief in
God
NOW how does the Christian belief in God meet
the general view and position of modern phil-
osophy just outlined?
Undoubtedly this belief aims to be something
entirely different from a merely intellectual insight
and a merely intellectually established world-view.
Its deepest roots do not he in rational understand-
ing and thinking. On the contrary, it is grounded
in those basic potentialities of the human soul which
are specifically religious. While these religious
potencies are closely connected with the aesthetical,
and especially with the ethical aspects of mind, and
are correlated with them in a great variety of ways
(especially with the latter), yet they are not
identical with them, but possess a peculiar and
independent significance.
But does not the realization of this fact itself
suffice for the modern man to condemn faith in
God? For will he not be compelled to point out,
and indeed rightly so, that the emotions are, to be
sure, a "very aimable, but at the same time a
highly dangerous brain function," and that they
have absolutely nothing to do with knowing the
31
truth. Haeckel, at least, thinks that this disposes
of the whole question.* But do such views really
prove him to be a modern man, if this expression is
to be used in a just and proper sense, or do they
not rather prove him to have lagged behind con-
temporary thought? Does not such a verdict
characterize that attitude of mind which can only
appreciate the intellectual side of man? The
further fact that Haeckel without further ado
converts the psychical into a brain function, not
claiming simply a definite connection between
them or a definite relation of each to the other, but
holding them to be identical, shall here be left out
of consideration. But is not such exclusive atten-
tion to and appreciation of the intellectual powers
taken in the narrower sense, a onesidedness which is
especially out of place in the modern man, who
should take into account the whole of reality in its
widest scope? If the modern man boasts of his
"sense of reality" as an attainment left for him to
achieve, then he should also feel himself logically
bound to follow this "sense of reality" without
prejudice, and he should not call it to a sudden
halt the moment it begins energetically to protest
against his preconceived opinion. The fact is that
there are other psychic forces, phenomena and
activities besides the purely intellectual which
belong to the full reality of the human soul! To
be sure all hasty misinterpretations of this fact
* Cf. "Riddle of the Universe," Ch. II. "Wonders of Life,"
Ch. V.
32
Chapter II—Epistemology
must be definitely rejected. But from the very
outset the fact itself must be taken into account
and fully appreciated. And that means that the
unique function and importance of these other
psychic forces and activities must be recognized.
The attitude of onesidedly excluding and re-
jecting, as a matter of principle, the phenomena of
the religious psychical life was possible for purely
intellectualistic rationalism, but, if it is not wan-
tonly to set aside its own principles, the "sense of
reality" of modern thinking must not take such an
attitude.
From the same point of view a protest must be
raised against those who only consider the religious
life in its relation to moral conduct, and accordingly
completely subordinate religion and faith in God to
ethics. This, too, is a onesidedness which fails to
give full play to the sense of reality, even though the
connection between the religious and the ethical
forces is in fac^ close and important. To be sure,
the thinkers in question are somewhat justified in
referring to Kant for this way of viewing and deal-
ing with the matter. But just at this point we are
confronted with a narrowness in Kant's philosophy
which is clearly based upon a limitation of his
whole nature and personality. For, with all the
loftiness and energy of his moral will, he was after
all dry and pedantic, and this is one of his pecu-
liarities which the "modern" man should not
imitate. In his article on Kant's personality,
Bauch justly writes: "When all man's acts are
33
subjected to reflection the purely emotional side
of his life is necessarily restrained and hampered.
Kant did not escape this experience in his own life.
Though it was not a necessary consequence of his
ethics, the imperative of the practical reason, owing
to Kant's personal bent toward an extreme inter-
pretation, was exaggerated until it was made into
what we commonly call a rational, in the sense of
intellectual, principle. Hence Kant himself pre-
vented the purely emotional side of his nature from
attaining complete expression and development,
and this very fact made it impossible for him to
understand the universal significance of this phase
of human life." * What Bauch here says of Kant's
inner life as a whole is especially true of its religious
side. Moreover, Kant himself did not, as a matter
of fact, consistently carry through the subordina-
tion of religion to morality. However little culti-
vated and developed, his own religious conscious-
ness protests against a consistent development of
his exclusively ethical theory of religion, and, at
least between the lines, religious faith is permitted
to speak for itself. Over and over again his char-
acterization of our moral disposition has a strictly
religious coloring. Thus, for example, he writes:
"There is, however, one thing in our soul which,
when we take a right view of it, we cannot cease to
regard with the highest astonishment, and in regard
to which admiration is right or even elevating, and
that is the original moral capacity in us generally."
* Kantstudien, IX, 1904, p. 205.
34
And a little further on he adds: "And even the
incomprehensibility of this capacity, a capacity
which proclaims a Divine origin, must rouse man's
spirit to enthusiasm, and strengthen it for any
sacrifices which respect for this duty may impose
upon him." * This clearly implies that ethical
matters fall under and are subordinate to the
domain of religion, and not the reverse! For here
the moral will is given depth and impetus by being
brought into relation with the "incomprehensi-
ble," into relation, that is to say, with the to us
mysterious world of the "beyond." And this is a
relation that is decisive for the trend and tendency
of the religious consciousness.
Considering the question on its own merits, there
can be no doubt whatever but that every attempt
to exhaust the meaning of religion by subordinating
it to ethics does violence to the full reality of the
life of the human soul as it really is. We need only
to recall the characteristic features of the religious
life already mentioned. The consciousness of the
meaning and depth of the world, the soul's longing
for eternity while in the world of temporal and
passing phenomena, its optimism persisting through
any misfortune or disappointments-all of these
facts of actual human experience really become
meaningless when considered solely from the point

p. 57 and p. 59. The words emphasized by Dr. Wobbermin show
the special aspects of the religious mood. The English is taken

35
of view of ethics. They are given various inter-
pretations but their proper import as facts of
experience is never admitted. Now after all, if it is
a fact of the greatest importance that Kant taught
us to take into account these moral forces of the
will which man feels in his inmost soul, as con-
trasted with the one-sided attention to the activity
of the intellect and to rational knowledge, and if he
laid the most emphatic stress upon the independ-
ence and the intrinsic importance of this moral will
(even the most highly developed intellect con-
ceivable cannot, according to Kant, vouchsafe even
the slightest degree of ethical consciousness), we
shall merely be drawing a necessary conclusion
from his own position if we demand a similar recog-
nition for the manifestations of religious feelings.27
And modern philosophy must all the more admit
the justice of this demand since, in going back to
Kant, it insists upon an unprejudiced recognition
of the whole reality of experience.
But do not most serious considerations against
the attempt to establish a place for the Christian
belief in God within modern thought arise from
another, and': in fact from the most decisive and
fundamental point, in the Kantian philosophy? If
we really take Kant's critical philosophy seriously
must we not either wholly renounce faith in God,
or, in any case, relegate it to the domain of pure
imagination, where all the standards of reflective
thought and rational deliberation are entirely
lacking? Both of these positions have been and are

36
still being maintained, but critical thinking in the
sense of Kant certainly does not lead to either.
It is true that Kant's philosophy intends to be
critical philosophy, and all thinking—at least all
scientific thinking—should and must be critical
thinking today. It must not be allowed to relapse
to the low level of pre-critical and uncritical think-
ing. From a protestant point of view there can
be no serious difference of opinion, even among
theologians, on this point. But the philosophy of
Kant, as well as all other thinking, gets its critical
character by going back to, and by a deliberate
examination of, the fundamental conditions of knowl-
edge. In order to reach the first and fundamental
decision as to the value and validity of human
thinking, Kant directed attention away from the
object of knowledge to the subject of knowledge,
and he thereby became the great reformer, or, as he
himself expressed it, the Copernicus of modern
thinking. For there had dawned upon him the
momentous idea, which, after all, is quite simple
and almost obvious, that objective knowledge pre-
supposes not merely objects but also the under-
standing itself, as the cognitive function of the
human mind or of human consciousness.
It then follows, however, that the results attained
through the understanding must be dependent,
not merely upon the material furnished to the
understanding, but upon thinking itself—upon the
constitution, so to speak, of the faculty of thinking.
Let me use a very crude illustration to make this
37
cleax. The nature of machine-made products, for
instance knit goods or cloth, depends not merely
upon the raw material fed into the machines, but
also upon these machines themselves—upon the
way in which they distribute the raw material and
arrange and combine its various elements. Quite
similar conditions must prevail for the human
understanding. Indeed, a knowledge of the nature
of the machine is the primary and indispensable
basis for any opinion as to the merits of the product
which it turns out. The same raw material may
yield products differing widely in quality and value
when different manufacturing processes are applied
to it, inasmuch as the distribution of this raw mate-
rial, the reassembling and composition of its various
elements may be carried out in very different ways.
Only a knowledge of the machines themselves will
enable one to understand this difference in quality
and value, for only such knowledge will show how
it is possible to turn out the various products. And
again it is the same with the human understanding.
If we would discuss the meaning and value of
human knowledge, we must first of all get a clear
idea concerning those fundamental conditions of
knowledge inherent in the human mind itself.
Kant called them the a priori moments of knowl-
edge. Thus he directed attention away from the
objects of knowledge to the subject of knowledge,
and to the conditions of knowledge inherent in the
latter, or, to put it more exactly, to the conditions
of the possibility of knowledge inherent in the sub-
38
ject. In doing this Kant brought about a revolu-
tion in thought, for he attacked the problem from
a fundamentally new position, reversing the r6les of
object and subject, just as Copernicus had reversed
the relation between the earth and sun of the naive
Ptolemaic cosmology * (which, to be sure, does not
deny that the sun itself may move).
Now this fundamental principle of the Kantian
epistemology presents a case altogether like that of
the egg of Columbus. When once it has been
grasped, and its fundamental meaning compre-
hended, it becomes the most obvious platitude.
But really to comprehend it fully and in its final
meaning is indeed a matter of no little difficulty.
In fact, those naive habits of thought, which, be-
fore any attempt is made to think "critically,"
have become flesh and blood of every human being,
must be completely overcome. How difficult this
may prove, even for highly educated men engaged
in scientific research, is shown by Haeckel's ab-
solute inability to surmount these naive habits of
thought. In his "Wonders of Life," published in
1904 to supplement his "Riddle of the Universe,"
he attempted again and again to refute the objec-
tion raised against him from many sides that his
philosophy, as set forth in the "Riddle of the
Universe," lacked an epistemological basis. Never-
theless he persists, throughout and from the very
outset, in the decisive error of dealing with knowl-
* See the "Critique of Pure Reason." Preface to the 2d ed.,
p. 16.
39
edge solely from the objective side. Claiming the
authority of Kant and referring to the latter's
bringing of experience and thinking into relation
with one another, he writes, for example: "The
external world is the object that acts on man's
organs of sense, and in the internal sense-centers
of the cortex of the brain these impressions are
subjectively transformed into presentations. The
thought-centers or association-centers of the cortex
(whether or not one distinguished them from the
sense-centers) are the real organs of the mind that
unite these presentations into conclusions. The
two methods of forming these conclusions—induc-
tion and deduction, the formation of arguments
and concepts, thought and consciousness—make
up together the cerebral function we call reason." *
Haeckel then emphatically claims that the recogni-
tion of these propositions is the "indispensable
prerequisite to the solution of the riddle of the
universe." As such, he points out, he had been
recommending these "fundamental truths" (!) for
thirty-eight years, but that, unfortunately, they
were still far from finding such recognition. As a
matter of fact this summary of so-called "fun-
damental truths" is a veritable maze of distortions,
unestablished sophisms and fallacious deductions.
To mention only the main point: considered from
the point of view of epistemology as a critique of
the understanding, the cognitive centers or associa-
tion areas of the cerebral cortex are, of course,
* "Wonders of Life," p. 4.
40
quite as objective as all other objects of the ex-
ternal world. For as parts of the cerebrum they
are certainly not acts of the understanding but in
fact objects of it.
Haeckel blinds himself to this truth by making
a distinction between "monistic" and "dualistic"
epistemology, claiming that he alone advocates
the correct, that is to say, the monistic epistemol-
ogy, and that his opponents represent the false
dualistic theory. Thus he fails to recognize the
fact that the theory of knowledge or critical
epistemology can and ought to be neither dualistic
nor monistic, but that it must be critical epistemol-
ogy and nothing else, that is to say, a critique of
the understanding as such. For otherwise it would
not enter upon its task without prejudice, but
would presuppose the result as a dogmatic pos-
tulate. In fact, the whole of Haeckel's so-called
monistic theory of knowledge or critical epistemol-
ogy is neither theory of knowledge nor critical
epistemology at all, but pure dogmatism (of a
naturalistic kind, however, whereas traditional
dogmatism is supernaturalistic). At the beginning
this dogmatism contains potentially the whole
metaphysics of naturalism, and it takes for its start-
ing point and as the basis of operations what, in
any case, could only be the conclusion.
Reference to the genesis of the cognitive faculty
of the human mind serves Haeckel as a final means
of defense. He asserts that the great mistake of
Kant was that he failed to take this genesis into
4i
consideration. "Kant had no suspicion of the ev-
olution of man's soul from that of the nearest re-
lated mammals. The curious predisposition to
a priori knowledge is really the effect of the in-
heritance of certain structures of the brain, which
have been formed in man's vertebrate ancestors
slowly and gradually, by adaptation to an associa-
tion of experiences, and therefore from a posteriori
knowledge." * Here Haeckel fails completely to
appreciate what is really involved, and substitutes
for the problem of epistemology an entirely dif-
ferent one, having simply nothing to do with that
problem. Moreover, his statement that Kant did
not think of this possibility of a gradual evolution
of the mental capacities is absolutely false. But
Kant saw that the epistemological problem, at
least in its decisive and essential points, cannot be
solved by starting from that basis. For the epis-
temological problem concerns human thinking as
distinguished from all other forms of consciousness
known to us. The characteristic features of this
thinking or understanding must be investigated and
criticised. But as to what process this capacity
for understanding has come into existence—that
is a question belonging to an entirely different
field of investigation, a question whose study may
indeed indirectly further the study of the epis-
temological problem, but whose solution in one
way or another neither gives nor can give a direct
solution to this epistemological problem. Let me
* Op. cit., p. 11.

refer again to the machine illustration. In passing
judgment on the products it makes no difference
whatever how the machines in question came to be
devised—whether this came about by a lucky
chance, or through an ingenious intuition, or by
utilizing devices already known, or by concen-
trated reflection directed toward constructing
machines for the purposes to be attained. In spite
of very different ways in which machines may be
produced their construction may in all cases be
the same, so that products of the same kind and
value are turned out. But it is also possible that
the machine discovered entirely by chance may
turn out better products than all other machines,
and of course the reverse may be true In short,
every imaginable case between these extremes is
possible, and many examples could actually be
cited from practical life As a matter of fact, the
origin and history of the machine are of no con-
sequence in passing judgment upon what it makes.
The main point is to know the principles upon
which it is based and the details of its construction.
And in dealing with the human faculty of under-
standing we have a closely analogous situation be-
fore us. However it may have come into existence,
it is in existence, and it must first of all be under-
stood and be dealt with on the basis of its own in-
herent properties.
Thus, from every point of view, Haeckel's own
so-called monistic theory of knowledge, and his
opposition to the Kantian theory of knowledge
43
proves to be untenable, non-critical and dogmatic.
And this is the basis upon which he would prove
that the Christian belief in God is out of date and
inconsistent with modern thought! His charge
reverts upon him with redoubled force.
Let us return, then, to the critical position of
Kant. To the short sketch already given we must
first of all add, as an immediate consequence of
this position, that scientific knowledge must be
strictly limited to the domain of possible expe-
rience. Human understanding does not extend
beyond the limits of such experience since it con-
sists in nothing but a working over of material
furnished by experience. And, in the second place,
it must be added that Kant's efforts are directed
toward ascertaining the inner structure of the
human understanding which forms the basis of all
normal human knowledge. For him the main
point is not to investigate the conditions of knowl-
edge as they exist more or less accidentally for
certain isolated individuals, but to study those
which hold for human consciousness quite gen-
erally. Hence everything pertaining merely to
individual cases in an accidental way must be
deliberately excluded. Kant assumes that the
characteristic and distinctive features of the faculty
of the understanding, which remain after such an
exclusion, are of a super-empirical nature, grounded
in the universal reason of things, and that, on their
part too, therefore, they direct attention to this
reason. Thus, in his opinion, they are connected
44
with the final and highest truth—with that primor-
dial reality which is the fons et origo and ultimate
goal of all that is and of all that comes to pass.
And in this, too, we shall have to agree with
Kant, at least to a certain extent. For if the world
and human life mean anything at all, if we human
beings are not born merely to live in error, and the
world in which we live is not simply a great and
empty delusion, we must assume that those fun-
damental characteristics of the faculty of under-
standing or reason exercised by man, which really
prove to be universally valid conditions of normal
human understanding, can in fact claim a super-
empirical validity precisely to the extent that they
prove to be such universally valid conditions of
normal human understanding, and that they direct
us to final and absolute truth. To be sure this is a
circular argument But as human beings we can-
not avoid this circle. Strictly considered we re-
main subject to it even though the particular in-
dividual can disregard it for himself. Nor can we
compel that man who denies, as a matter of prin-
ciple, that there is any possibility whatever for
man to approach the truth to admit the conclusion
that we draw from the opposite conviction.
But although we can agree with Kant thus far,
we must, nevertheless, raise strong objections to
the further development of his basic thought, and
we must insist that a revision of it is indispensable.
First of all, this even applies to Kant's attempt
to establish once for all by an abstract logical
45
process those a priori characteristics of the human
understanding. Such an attempt conflicts with
the whole unbiased sense of reality since this sense
of reality must not, once for all and from the very
outset, be closed to any possible new experiences.
To be sure, logic, conceived as a closed system of
human norms of thinking, is consistent and valid
beyond a quibble, but the logical thinking of the
race, bound as it is to experience, is, like all human
life itself, subject to historical development. A
propos to a detailed development of the basic idea
of Kant's critical philosophy, we must, therefore,
insist upon the two points above asserted to apply
quite generally, namely: unflagging regard to the
material furnished by experience, as it is given to
us by history and psychology, and accordingly,
repudiation of the absolutistic attitude.
This leads to another matter. In discussing
Kant's critical philosophy or A priorism we have
thus far always considered only the faculty of
understanding of the human mind, cognition and
its exercise. We did this, first, in order to be as
clear as possible, and secondly, because Kant him-
self started from here and always had a special
interest in this side of the problem. But all of
what was said above holds by no means only of
cognition or of the intellectual activity of the mind
of man, but it holds of his whole mental life and his
whole mental activity. The ethical will, the aestheti-
cal feelings and the religious consciousness must all
be given the same consideration. But even in this
46
respect Kant was led to a somewhat narrow view.
Religious matters he usually put decidedly into the
background, and aesthetic matters were not always
given the consideration which their importance
deserves. Thus there remained for him, as the
main subjects to be considered, only cognition and
ethical volition—the theoretical and the practical
reason, as he expressed it. After isolating these for
purposes of comparison he exaggerated the contrast
between them. He brought out clearly the charac-
teristic differences between these two modes of
activity of the human mind, but he did not suffi-
ciently elucidate either the fact that, after all, they
belong together, or the fact of the correlations be-
tween them. To be sure, he classifies both under
the common concept of reason—theoretical and
practical reason, thus making it very clear that,
even from the point of view of critical philosophy,
the final aim is not to tear them asunder, but to
establish more firmly the fact that they belong to-
gether (only on the basis, of course, of the preceding
critical distinction between them). Nevertheless,
with Kant the view that these two spheres are
entirely different and have nothing to do with one
another often preponderates. And since he simply
subordinates the religious consciousness to the
moral will, this contrast is considerably intensified
when a determination of the relation between
knowledge and religious faith is sought.
Consequently it may seem to be a necessary
result of critical philosophy simply to put belief
47
in God outside the province of thinking reflection,
and to relegate it to a sphere in which rational
thinking has absolutely nothing, either negatively
or affirmatively, to say. As a matter of fact this
was not Kant's own position, and least of all was
it so in his later years when he sought to sum up the
results attained by critical philosophy.28 But
owing to the one-sided limitations of his position
already pointed out, he certainly did furnish ground
for such a view. These limitations we must, there-
fore, deliberately seek to overcome, and we must
do this by developing the fundamental idea of
critical philosophy in all its aspects.
Hence we must indeed distinguish between
specifically scientific reasoning and inner convic-
tions together with interpretations of nature and
history, dependent upon and not entirely separable
from these inner convictions. But even though
such interpretations differ from scientific conclu-
sions and demonstrations, nevertheless they can
and must themselves be made the subject of sci-
entific reflection, and the positive value of such
interpretations may be shown to vary greatly.
By scientific reflection it is possible to set up a
descending or ascending scale of groups of such
interpretations and convictions, varying in impor-
tance and scope.
It will not do, then, to try to solve the chief
problem of theology—the relation between faith
and knowledge, between belief in God and philos-
ophy—by means of a mere delimitation of bound-
48
aries, simply by drawing a line and saying: "Here
we cannot cross over, but neither may you cross
over to us." To begin with, our opponents will
not submit to this. And we must grant that this
attitude is not altogether wrong. To be sure, in
dealing with these problems it is highly important
and necessary to take into consideration the limits
of human thinking and knowledge, to proceed in
fact, with epistemological objectivity. But all of
those questions and problems, in respect to which
knowledge and faith in God seemingly or in reality
come into conflict, must be considered, and the
position held on the part of faith in God must be
justified. This is necessary, too, because, in the
last analysis, epistemology itself is not independent
of the sum total of human thought and knowledge.
In every instance, indeed, it must stand above the
whole of knowledge, but it cannot do this except by
taking this very knowledge as a basis, and hence it
remains bound to the latter after all.
The conclusion of all this seems to me to be that
beside the watchword: "Back to Kant" we must
also put: "On from Kant!" Only in conjunction
with the second is the first really justified. But, to
be sure, we must start from Kant and not otherwise.
After all, therefore, first: "Back to Kant!"
In the light of experience it is not probable that
all the mistakes of the Schelling-Hegel speculative
philosophy would be avoided as an immediate
consequence of proceeding from the motto: "On
from Kant!" We shall be able to point out many
49
instances of similar mistakes in present-day philos-
ophy. I am sure that such are to be found in my
own writings. But the mistakes will be less serious,
and, since, therefore, the deviations from the path
leading to all scientific progress will become less, it
will be possible on the whole to make a little head-
way toward the goal.
In seeking to uphold the Christian belief in God
in a systematic and philosophical way, it is not
admissible to use the general philosophy of Kant as
a basis. For Kant opposed the traditional at-
tempts of this sort in detail, and, at least according
to the opinion prevalent among theologians today,
he disposed of them conclusively. These traditional
attempts consist in the so-called proofs for the
existence of God, and these proofs have almost
entirely lost standing in theology of the present
day. But to be frank, I cannot bring myself to
accept this unfavorable verdict completely and
without further comment. The motives and ten-
dencies, upon which the principal forms of these
proofs are founded, contain, it seems to me, sig-
nificant elements of truth which are of permanent
value. Indeed it is my firm conviction that we
can today, by reason of the present stage of our
knowledge and understanding attach to these mo-
tives and tendencies a far greater demonstrative
force than was possible for the theologians and
philosophers of the past.
But in the nature of things two groups of these
arguments must be distinguished. One group is
5°
based upon the study of nature and the natural
sciences, while the other has to do with the mental
life and the mental sciences. Now if my aim were
to establish the Christian belief in God on positive
philosophical grounds (in the sense explained in
detail above), I should, at least in my opinion,
have to put the emphasis entirely upon the second
group, and I should have to proceed from the re-
flections which are based upon inner experience as
the starting point. But my task is rather to discuss
the positions held and the results attained by cur-
rent philosophy. And from this point of view I
must begin with the first group, since only with
respect to this group can current philosophy be
said to have anything like consistent positions, or
to have attained consistent results.
Of course, all these proofs are untenable in their
traditional classical form. For in this form Kant's
criticism demolished them.
Si
Cosmology and the Christian Belief in
'HE classical form of the cosmological argument
J- operates with various nuances of the thought
that from the world as the effect God as cause is a
necessary conclusion. Since for every effect a cause
must be presupposed, by rising higher and higher
from cause to cause, a highest and last cause—God,
must finally be reached. Hence the decisive prin-
ciple of proof here is the law of causality. It is
conceived as a supreme and absolutely valid cosmic
law to which the universe must conform. I have
mentioned this classical form of the argument just
because the principle of causality, upon which it is
founded, directs attention to that problem which
is of the greatest importance for the whole question.
For all the more specific laws of nature fall, as
special cases, under the law of causality, but in the
cosmological argument we have to do with a world
constituted according to these laws.
Let us first consider the law of causality purely
on its own merits. That hypothesis is false which
says that this law possesses a validity in and of itself,
and that it is an absolute and supreme universal law,
to which the whole universe must necessarily con-
God

form. Hence the conclusion that there is a highest
cause is untenable. The law of causality compels
us to seek a cause for every effect, and does not
permit us to stop anywhere in this process. Thus
in using this law of causality we do not reach a
highest and first or original cause, but are involved
in an infinite series—a regressus in infinitum. I
have stated that the other conception of the law of
causality, set forth above, is false. We may say
that today it is no longer held in science or philos-
ophy, although we shall see that it is still brought
into play to a certain extent. Apart from these
exceptions, which I shall presently mention, I may
refer to all the philosophers cited in Chapter I for
the following discussion.
The principle of causality maintained by sci-
entific philosophy today is a different one. As its
starting point it takes the fact that we can only
note, by direct observation of nature, a succession
of two or more events, and never a real causation
in the sense of an active influence from one event to
another. As a result of our inability to observe the
actual connection, some philosophers have actually
sought to reduce causality to the unfailing succes-
sion in time of one event upon another. Hume led
the way in holding this view, and so-called pos-
itivism has often taken up this thesis of Hume.
But it, too, is false because it is one-sided and in-
sufficient. For we only speak of causality when we
look upon the occurrence of the consequent event
in question as necessary. This characteristic of
53
necessity forms an inseparable and an essential
part of what we consider to be causal connection.
We assume a causal relation between an increase of
temperature and the rising of the mercury in the
thermometer, because we have a preconceived idea
that this rising necessarily follows from the in-
creasing temperature. This is the concept of
causality of present-day philosophy. It asserts
a necessary connection between two successive
events. In order to prevent confusing it with the
mistaken interpretation mentioned above, philos-
ophers prefer to express this modern concept of
causality in terms of the mathematical concept of
function. Modern mathematics designates as a
functional relation any relation between two quan-
tities such that a change in the value of one neces-
sarily involves a change in the value of the other,
or, to put it differently, that of two variable
quantities one represents the independent variable,
and the other the variable dependent upon the
independent variable, or simply the dependent
variable. Accordingly the modern concept of
causality can be expressed by the formula: e =
f (c), which means that the effect stands in a func-
tional relation to the cause—in the relation of a
necessarily dependent variable.
This consideration, and especially the reference
to the mathematical analogy, proves that the law of
causality contains a subjective element. For this
characteristic of necessity cannot come from expe-
rience. Experience knows only particular occur-
54
rences and events—particular facts, but no neces-
sity. When, in spite of this, we mean by a causal
relation the relation of necessary connection be-
tween two events, this necessity must be intro-
duced or assumed by us. From this point of view,
therefore, the law of causality is nothing but the
fundamental hypothesis made by us for the sci-
entific study of natural phenomena. And for this
reason the classical cosmological argument is un-
tenable. But this insight immediately leads further.
I have already pointed out that all special laws of
nature can be regarded as special cases of the causal
law, since the latter is the most general law of
nature under which all others are subsumed, and
to which they are subordinate. Consequently all
natural laws must be treated like the causal law.
None of them can claim an absolute objective
validity because all contain a subjective element.
Now this is of prime importance in dealing with
those representatives of a materialistic philosophy
who use these very laws of nature in arguing against
faith in God. Haeckel is the chief of these. There
are no absolutely binding laws of nature in the
sense of expressing norms of the objective world-
order which are valid in themselves and unal-
terably fixed. Haeckel holds a position which must
today be considered unscientific when he brings
up this conception of the laws of nature, with the
corresponding conception of the law of causality in
particular, against faith in God. Not only philos-
ophers, but also the more discerning natural
55
scientists, have ceased to hold this view which
Haeckel advocates. Among the latter, Ostwald,
in his lectures on natural philosophy, has recently
laid special stress upon the fact that laws of nature
must not be looked upon as decrees but merely as
reports. They do not decree what shall come to
pass, but merely give an account of what we can
observe and bring under a comprehensive concep-
tion. And, in fact, this is the only conception of
laws of nature which is scientifically useful and
adequate.
After all, however, this does not dispose of the
question as to what the laws of nature are. As we
saw, they contain a subjective factor, yet, on the
other hand, they are by no means purely subjective.
Let us again consider causality. To be sure, the
necessity which we attach to whatever takes place
in accordance with the causal law depends upon
our way of looking at things. But the causal con-
nection itself is not put or interpreted into nature
solely by us. On the contrary, it must somehow
be in nature objectively, or, to formulate the mat-
ter more carefully, there must be in nature itself
an objective basis for our considering the causal
law to hold. For, as far as we are concerned, with-
out this assumption the whole course of the world
would at every moment be reduced to mere chance.
It is indeed a most astonishing fact that the stone
thrown into the air for a million or even a billion
times falls back again, but we could not, simply
from this, deduce the least probability that this
56
would be the result of the billion and first or any
other new instance, unless, at least in a broad
general way, we presuppose the existence of a
fixed order of things, so that from the greater or less
number of cases we might conclude, with a greater
or less degree of probability, that there is such an
order in this particular respect. Nor, unless we
assume the objective existence of a fixed order of
things, could we with any degree of probability,
assume for the next moment of time that with an
increase of temperature the mercury would again,
as always in the past, rise in the thermometer.
Only upon the basis of the hypothesis of an objec-
tive existence of a fixed natural order is there any
probability for this assumption, just as in math-
ematics we speak of probability only when a lim-
ited number of variables is given. The probability
of drawing a definite one from an infinity of chances
is one to infinity (co), that is, there is no proba-
bility.* Thus, for every subsequent moment of
time, the probability that the stone thrown into the
air would again fall to earth, that with an increase
in temperature the mercury would again rise in the
thermometer, that the earth would again turn on
its axis and revolve about the sun and would con-
tinue with the sun to move through space—in these
and in all similar cases the probability would be
* oo is the mathematical symbol for infinity. For readers who
are entirely unfamiliar with the principles of the theory of prob-
ability, we may note, that the probability of drawing a particular
one of six chances is one to six (J), since six chances are possible
and only one of them will give the desired result.
57
one to infinity or nothing, if we did not assume a
fixed order of nature.
These considerations make it possible for us to
make a final estimate of the laws of nature as a
whole, so far as such an estimate is important in
the present connection. These laws are based upon
a process of abstraction on our part, for we arrive
at them by contemplating reality under certain
definite points of view and from specific angles,
while intentionally leaving other points of view
out of consideration. In this sense the laws of
nature contain a subjective element. Moreover,
these laws of nature do not possess an absolute
validity—a necessary validity in and of them-
selves, for they hold only for the present world—
the world as we know it. However, with respect
to this world the laws of nature indeed point to
rules actually holding for the course of nature it-
self, and particular ones of them can be brought
to a greater or less degree of probability. In fact,
some of them, as for instance the law of falling
bodies, the law of gravitation, and others, have
already attained a force of the highest degree of
probability.
Let us now return to the cosmological argument.
We have found that seeking to deduce a highest
cause by means of the law of causality, is founded
on a misconception. On the other hand, when we
do not base the cosmological argument on detached
natural phenomena and on the course of nature in
particular instances, but subject the whole course
58
of nature to thoughtful reflection, do not the
actual actions and reactions as well as the correla-
tions of finite individual beings and events compel
us to assume a transcendent being, standing above
this whole complex of actions and reactions, and
making their harmonious interplay comprehen-
sible? Before answering this question let us recall,
by means of a few examples, what we know today
concerning the objective logic of the course of
nature.
Above us arch the starry heavens. Since the
days of Galileo modern astronomy has increased
the number of known heavenly bodies beyond all
bounds. Ranging from the first to the tenth magni-
tude more than a hundred thousand fixed stars are
known today, and many of these are probably
surrounded by a greater or less number of planets.
The milky-way, the equatorial belt of our system
of fixed stars, has been resolved into millions of
suns, and beyond these appear other systems of
world-nebulae and of milky-ways. We no longer
imagine the vast multitude of fixed stars to be
firmly attached to a great hollow sphere, because
we know that all of them move through space with
enormous velocity. And we know, too, that the
same constellations which we see today were seen
by the Babylonians and the Egyptians, or by the
author of the ninth verse of the ninth chapter of
Job. How astounding is the order and regularity
exhibited by the movements of these heavenly
bodies! Especially when we remember that the
59
heavens, as they greet our eyes at a given moment
of a star-lit night, represent many different epochs
of the history of the universe. For while, as is
well known, the rays of light coming to us from the
sun tell us of its existence eight minutes previously,
those coming from the north star, for example,
tell us of its existence thirty-five years previously.
We know the laws in accordance with which the
planets revolve about the sun, and the satelites
around the planets, so that by calculation we can
determine eclipses of the sun and moon very accu-
rately for centuries past and for centuries to come.
Our knowledge of these laws is such that the exist-
ence of a planet heretofore unknown, Neptune,
could be established a priori."® We know the laws
of light in the universe, towit, that the intensity of
light diminishes inversely as the square of the dis-
tance increases, and we know that the velocity of
the transmission of light varies with the density of
the medium but remains constant for the same
medium, and we know the various velocities. We
know that the intensity of an electric current is
directly proportional to the electro-motive force,
and inversely proportional to the resistance of the
conductor. By the law of degradation or conserva-
tion of energy, discovered simultaneously but in-
dependently by Robert Mayer and Helmholz, we
know that all agencies of the material universe—
mechanical motion, heat, light, chemical and elec-
trical processes—constitute a great and connected
system of nature, in which forces or energies of one
60
kind are continually transformed into absolutely
equivalent forces or energies of another kind.
Obviously, then, an objective mathematical logic
prevails in the world, even though our calculations
and conceptions represent merely a system of
symbols pointing to an actuality whose real essence
is absolutely inaccessible to us. Taking up an
idea due to Laplace, Dubois-Reymond, in his well-
known lecture "Uber die Grenzen des Welter-
kennens," says that a stage of our knowledge of
nature is conceivable in which the whole process of
nature would be represented by a single mathemat-
ical formula, by a single infinite system of differen-
tial equations, from which the position, the direc-
tion of motion and the velocity of every atom in
the universe would be deducible at any moment
of time. This statement, however, goes beyond the
limitations of our knowledge of nature inasmuch
as it creates the impression at least, that we are
here concerned with an absolutely established order
of the universe as such. We have clearly seen that
this is out of the question. However, when the
statement is limited as indicated it holds true.30
Now what follows from all this? The existence of
a personal God? By no means. Or at least the
reasonableness of belief in a personal God? This,
too, is not immediately necessary. But less pre-
tentious results are not valueless. Expressed in
the most general terms, and hence with universal
validity, it follows that every complete and com-
prehensive philosophical view must assume or
61
accept a consistent prime cause of the universe.
This makes materialistic atheism philosophically
meaningless, if we interpret the word atheism in
the strict sense so that it is opposed to every form
of pantheism as well as to theism. This is the first
result at which we here arrive: strict atheism is
philosophically meaningless and untenable. Today
the great majority of philosophers admit this.
Mach's contrary view is based upon his epistemol-
ogy, an epistemology which is closely related to
that of the empirio-critical philosophy. On this
basis he acknowledges only a mere economic value
of the so-called laws of nature. Just as every dis-
tinction between subjective and objective is un-
warranted, according to Mach, because we are
absolutely and forever confined to the sphere of
our ideas, so also the laws of nature are conse-
quently purely subjective modes of ours and for
our purposes of looking upon nature. We have
seen that this conception is erroneous. But not
only the representatives of philosophy proper, but
also all the more discerning among natural scien-
tists, acknowledge that this first result is warranted.
And those natural scientists who do not acknowl-
edge it (Haeckel may again be cited as the most
important present-day representative of this class),
are involved, as a consequence, in the most as-
tounding self-contradictions and the most extrav-
agant theories. For in order to explain how this
ordered cosmos originated from the random play
of eternal atoms Haeckel is finally compelled to
62
endow these atoms themselves with feeling and
volitional impulses. But this is a view which is,
in the first place, entirely uncritical, since we simply
have no knowledge of animate atoms, the concept
atom being, on the contrary, only an aid for our
conception, interpretation and calculation of the
course of nature. On the other hand, if consistently
thought out this view would lead to Leibnitz's
theory of monads, and hence to some form of pan-
theism or theism.
But is this exclusion of rigorous atheism all that
can be attained by using the cosmological argu-
ment? It is the only definite and unequivocal re-
sult which follows. However, speculations of
probability lead beyond this. That we must con-
ceive this consistent prime cause of the universe
rather as of the nature of a mathematical logical
intelligence may undoubtedly be considered the
most obvious position to take, after what we have
said. We may, therefore, brand as ill-founded
conceptions like that of Hartmann-Drews of the
unconscious absolute, or like that of Herbert
Spencer of one universal immanent living energy,
which, as he says, may not be determined more
definitely, either materially or spiritually. Indeed
this is even true, although in less measure, of
Wundt's conception of an absolute basis of the
universe regarded as an absolute world-will, of
which it is impossible to form a specific idea even
in the shape of an ideal.31
On the basis of the cosmological argument we
63
cannot go further than this. In order to gain a
fuller appreciation of the philosophical conceptions
last mentioned we must turn to teleological reason-
ing, and ask how far it will serve to supplement and
to extend the cosmological reasoning.
However, before going into this question, I
shall, under the point of view of the above discus-
sion, treat another and different problem—the
problem of miracle. Although it is not really of
great consequence for Christian faith itself, it is
so for its history. At the same time the question
just implied will have to find an answer, the ques-
tion, namely, whether and in what respect Christian
faith has an abiding interest in the problem of
miracle.
To begin exactly with that formulation of this
question which is common among the wider public,
it may be precisely expressed as follows: Are mir-
acles necessarily a component part of the Christian
religion?
Now if an answer to this question is to be given
from the standpoint of the Christian religion, the
Christian to whom it is put finds himself in a some-
what awkward position. He can answer "yes" and
"no" with equal justice, and this not, as it were, to
qualify and to confuse the problem, but from the
depth of his Christian religious convictions.
"No," for what have such external and extrinsic
things as accounts of miracles and miraculous
64
events to do with the most concentrated inward-
ness of the spiritual and ethical personal life which
the Christian religious conviction represents?
Though "miracles" may be an indispensable
factor in religions of a lower order, the religion of
spirit and power stands superior to them, as is ex-
pressed indirectly, but yet very plainly, in the
words of Jesus: "Except ye see signs and wonders,
ye will not believe."
But still, on the other hand, "yes," miracles
necessarily belong to religion, also and especially
to the Christian religion. Indeed, taken in its
entirety, the Christian religion itself is a miracle,
whether considered from an objective-historical
or a subjective-psychological point of view. And
all the leading ideas in which it finds expression
are designations of miracles—conversion, regenera-
tion, redemption, atonement, peace with God,
life in God! Above all, however, the basic fact of
the religious life, which has attained full realiza-
tion in Christianity and which the ideas just men-
tioned then aim to define more closely from dif-
ferent points of view, means, indeed, the miracle
of miracles—the absolute miracle. For it means
that, in spite of his finitude and although involved
altogether in finite relations, man is given in his
faith the power and the possibility of rising above
the whole realm of temporal finite existence, and
into that higher world transcending all mundane
affairs—the world of God, of becoming, in a com-
mon life, one with God himself!
65
Thus we have two entirely different and even
contradictory answers! But from our discussion
it must already be clear that the contradiction in
these answers is due to the fact that the word
miracle by no means represents a simple, but on
the contrary, a very complex concept. Hence the
first and fundamental point is what we mean by
miracle. Two questions are, therefore, of decisive
importance: In what sense are miracles an integral
part of the Christian religion? What does the
belief in miracles mean for the Christian religion?
Let us begin with the latter. According to the
view prevailing at the present time, miracles are
such events as lie outside of the usual course of
things, that is to say, outside of the course of
events under the sway of the laws of nature, and
they, therefore, involve a setting aside of these
laws. For we of today look upon the "usual course
of things" as subject to the laws of nature.
Now, to begin with, if we compare with this the
attitude of faith, that of the Bible in particular,
we find two important differences. In the first
place, the conception of an order according to the
laws of nature, at any rate in the exact modern
sense of the word, is not found in the Bible. Hence,
for it "the course of events as ordinarily known"
is not at once and necessarily a course subject to
laws of nature in our sense. In fact, this has quite
frequently and properly been pointed out.
But the second difference is of still greater con-
sequence. The scriptural belief in miracles does
66
not even greatly emphasize this lying outside of
the known order of things. Emphasis is rather
laid upon attributing the so-called miracles to God,
because the hand of God is seen in them. They
are, therefore, looked upon as acts of the universal
sovereignity of God.
Consequently, it is the belief in providence which
finds expression in the idea of miracle. It is from
this point of view that the miracle stories of the
Bible must primarily be considered, if their reli-
gious essence is to find due appreciation. In short,
belief in providence is the psychological motive of
belief in miracles. The details of the outward form
in which miracles are clothed are immaterial and
they are, of course, in accordance with the state of
learning and knowledge of that time.
When we consider the Christian religion as a
whole, that is to say, in its historical development,
what has just been said about the psychological
motive of the idea of miracle becomes still clearer.
Especially do the legends of saints of the Roman
Catholic Church offer a great store of material to
support the thesis that the real religious basis of
"miracles" is the belief in providence. These
miracle stories are, so to speak, the symbolization
and the materialization of the belief in providence. It
goes without saying that this belief itself may be
endangered by such a materialization. Even down
to our own day history furnishes us many examples
of this. We need only think of Lourdes, above all,
but also of many an excess in the religious life
67
exhibited in our own (Lutheran) church, especially
when there is a pietistic tendency.
This does not alter the fact, however, that the
element of religious value in the idea of miracle is
to be found in the belief in providence.
The real problem for the modern man, therefore,
is: (i) Does the Christian belief in providence, if
it is to be effectual, require an occasional setting
aside of the laws of nature? (2) Is this belief in
providence at all compatible with our present
state of scientific knowledge, in particular, with
our knowledge of the laws of nature?
At the very outset, then, we put these questions
solely with reference to the Christian belief in
providence. For while many analogies, rudiments
and preliminaries of the belief in providence are to
be found in other religions, this belief receives in
Christianity a form entirely and quite peculiar to
this religion. Here this belief comes into play to a
far greater extent and goes much deeper than in
any other religion or world-view.
For the Christian belief in providence is the con-
viction that everything that exists and all that
happens has its origin in God, and hence, that
nothing whatever, be it what it may, has ever
happened or will ever happen apart from the will
of God. Applying this to the individual, the fur-
ther conviction follows that whatever may come
to his lot is in accordance with the will of God and
therefore redounds to his good, at any rate, that
it may and is intended to serve this purpose, inas-
68
much as it is designed to be the means of his attain-
ing eternal life.
This conviction is directly implied in and is in-
separable from the Christian belief in God. In-
deed, to be precise, it is not something put into the
Christian belief in God, but it is itself this belief in
God, exhibited from a definite angle and under a
definite point of view. The belief in providence
constitutes, as it were, the world-view of the
Christian religion.
The justification of this belief in providence in
any particular case cannot, therefore, be estab-
lished on purely objective grounds. If it could be
so established, it would cease to be religious faith.
Personal voluntary acceptance of this belief is
rather the indispensable prerequisite of its meeting
the test in a concrete case. This is a matter of
course, inherent in the subject. For if the belief
in providence is convinced that whatever falls to
the lot of an individual is ordained for him by God
as a means for his attaining eternal life, then what-
ever falls to his lot can only come into full play
as a real means for attaining eternal life, when it is
made possible for it to come into play to this end,
that is to say, when it is made part of the belief in
God's providential dispensation. In any other case
there is no inner disposition to permit these things
that fall to the lot of the individual to become what,
according to the conviction of the belief in prov-
idence, they must become.
Thus, by making belief in providence its world-
69
view the Christian religion consciously attaches the
highest importance to the personal voluntary
decision, the decision, moreover, of every individual
believer. Hence, although it makes absolutely
all things dependent upon God, this belief in prov-
idence is in no respect fatalistic. On the contrary,
it always includes the personal decision of the will,
not merely admitting but demanding it and in-
cluding it with other fundamental assumptions.
According to Christian faith the personal voluntary
decision of man is a part of that reality which, as an
entirety, is dependent upon God, and it is equally
a part of the divine purpose and regime of the
universe.
Indeed, it is for this very reason that the justifica-
tion of belief in providence cannot be established,
in any particular case, in a strictly objective and
purely theoretical way. It can only be confirmed
from practical life. Quite generally speaking,
however, similar conditions hold for every world-
view. A world-view is never a matter of mere
theoretical reasoning and mere intellectual reflec-
tion. It is at the same time always a matter of
the practical conduct of life and of the position
taken in and toward the world in practical life.
If this was frequently overlooked in the age of in-
tellectualistic and speculative philosophy, hardly
any of the philosophers of an idealistic bent se-
riously question it today. Indeed many of them,
especially James, Wundt, Paulsen, Eucken, Dil-
they, Rickert and Windelband, unconditionally
70
admit it. The belief in providence, as the world-
view of the Christian religion, thus consciously
emphasizes in this respect a phase which, whether
it be explicitly recognized or not, belongs after all
to the psychological character of every world-
view.
From this brief sketch of the nature of the
Christian belief in providence the answer to the
two questions stated above is almost obvious.
Does a complete development of the Christian
belief in providence require an occasional setting
aside of the laws of nature? Absolutely no. If this
belief in providence carries with it the conviction
that absolutely all that happens has its origin in
God, and accordingly, if it sees in the ordered
course of the universe, so far as we are able to know
and to determine such a course, an image of the
universal sovereignty of God, then this belief in
and of itself has no concern whatever to desire
that it be possible occasionally to set aside this
ordered course of nature. Quite to the contrary,
since such a setting aside of this ordered course of
nature would encourage the view that God inter-
vened in the universal course of nature only by
extraordinary acts and only occasionally. Thus
the relation of God to the world would be con-
ceived as far less essential and real than the Chris-
tian belief in God holds it to be. Indeed, for this
belief the relation of God to the world is absolutely
real and constant, and without any exception:
"Without the will of God no sparrow falleth to the
71
earth and no hair from our head. He maketh his
sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth
rain on the just and the unjust."
The idea of a world ordered by the laws of
nature would only be in contradiction with the
Christian belief in providence, and hence with the
Christian belief in God, if the course of nature were
thought of as interposed, with absolute conformity
to its own laws, between God and the happening
of particular events, if, in other words, it were
interposed in such a way between God and the
happening of particular events, that it would be
looked upon as entirely independent of God. And
this would mean that it would be a positive ab-
solute. But then the laws of nature which con-
stitute the course of nature would have to claim
an independent validity on their own merits, and,
as we saw above, this is something which they can-
not justly claim.
From a psychological point of view, just here
lies the real motive and the kernel of truth in the
exception which faith often takes to an order of
things under the laws of nature. By reason of its
religious consciousness it protests, with this objection,
against the sway of such an order of things according
to laws of nature as being of itself and in itself an
absolute and ultimate reality. Therefore, by main-
taining certain exceptions in particular cases, it is
inclined to establish, to its own satisfaction, the
justice of this protest, and the injustice of the
opposite view, whether that view be consciously
72
formed or merely unconsciously favored. Hence
miracle is the favorite child of faith.
Turning, now, to the second question: Is the
Christian belief in providence at all compatible
with our present-day scientific knowledge, with
that of the laws of nature in particular? Again the
answer is implicit in what has been said. The
Christian belief in providence and the scientific
or causal conception of the universe are not mu-
tually exclusive, no, not even when both are fol-
lowed out with all possible rigor and completeness.
In fact, they are entirely diverse points of view,
and instead of being mutually exclusive they are
rather mutually supplementary.
The causal idea always possesses a twofold
aspect, and hence can always be considered and
developed in two ways. In the first place, in every
more or less closed system of phenomena, we may
investigate the dependence of every definite com-
plex of phenomena of a particular kind on the re-
maining complexes in the same system. But we
may also investigate the dependence of every
particular event on the controlling powers of nature
assumed to be constant. So long as one has in
mind only partial systems of the phenomenal
world both conceptions are still within the realm
of scientific reflection. But if one turns his atten-
tion to the phenomenal world as a whole, that is, to
the complete system of finite existence and of finite
events, only the first conception remains open to
scientific consideration, namely: that which seeks
73
to understand the dependence of all the various
single phenomena upon one another. To be sure,
even here scientific reflection must admit the pos-
sibility of the second causal conception, which now
seeks the absolutely final cause of every single
event. But the latter no longer belongs to the
domain of scientific reflection, since it leads beyond
the sphere of the phenomenal world.
It is precisely with this last consideration and
attitude, and only with it, that faith has to do.
It makes the whole phenomenal world and every-
thing that occurs in it dependent upon God as the
highest and absolute reality. But under this point
of view everything that is and occurs in the world
can be interpreted as a "miracle." For the world
itself as a whole, the fact that it is at all, and that
it is as it is, is entirely beyond the comprehension
of man, and hence, taken from a purely objective
point of view, it is a miracle, indeed, an absolute
miracle. The subjective reference to the relation
of the individual to God comes into play as a fur-
ther element for the religious attitude toward the
matter, and consequently faith designates as "mir-
acle" only what in particular instances seems to
it to point with special clearness beyond the world
of phenomena and directly to God. What in a
given case constitutes this depends solely on sub-
jective personal conditions and preconceptions.
Objectively considered, however, the position
must be maintained that in the last analysis every-
thing may become "miracle" for the individual—
74
the least as well as the greatest, the commonplace
no less than the unusual—and that it shall at
the proper time become miracle. For the whole
world is God's, and even the least and most insig-
nificant thing can give a glimpse of the world
beyond.
But when it has once grasped the meaning and
import of this inquiry faith, especially belief in
providence, has no interest whatever in really ex-
traordinary phenomena in the sense that they set
aside the laws of nature. Faith can leave it en-
tirely to purely academic discussion to deal with
this matter. Such discussion will lead to an epis-
temological delimitation of the concept of the
"laws of nature," such as we have already set
forth above.
Finally, to bring this discussion of the concept
of and the belief in miracle to a close, one thing
more must be added. It makes a difference, and
indeed a momentous and significant difference,
whether we have in mind the sphere of the mate-
rial course of nature or that of the inner psychic
life and its relations to the organism. So far as we
can see, the causal law holds sway in the former
in the form of a strict equivalence of cause and ef-
fect, that is to say, according to the formula, causa
aquat effectum—cause and effect are quantita-
tively equal and can be quantitatively balanced
against one another.
But the law of causality must not in this form
be extended to the domain of the inner life, least
75
of all to that of the higher mental life. Quantita-
tive considerations play an altogether unessential
r6le in the inner life. Here, on the contrary, the
qualitative content is the crucial thing. Hence it
is impossible to set up for this inner life, and its
relations to the organism, anything at all like such
fixed rules as for the material course of nature.
At any rate this is entirely beyond our power at
present. As far as we are able to apprehend any-
thing about the laws of the psychic life, these run
in an exactly opposite direction to those of phys-
ical and material causality. What might here come
into question is not a law of quantitative equal-
ity, but far more a law of "spiritual growth"—
a law of an increased growth of the products of the
mind. I thus adopt the terminology advocated
by Wundt because, as the senior in exact psycho-
physiological investigation, he is entitled to special
consideration in this matter, but futhermore, be-
cause his formulation shows very plainly what
care must here be exercised in using the concept
"law."
As to the matter itself, there can certainly no
longer be any serious difference of opinion with re-
spect to the crucial point. The soul is not a mere
causal mechanism. This is admitted today by
practically all philosophers. And not only philos-
ophers admit it, but also natural scientists in in-
creasing numbers are admitting it, and among
them, above all, the representatives of that science
which is here primarily concerned, namely: psy-
76
chiatry. They realize that it is to the interest of
psychiatry to recognize that lawfulness peculiar to
the psychical as psychical. Thus, for example,
W. Hellpach, who has already on other occasions
proven that he is an investigator of psychological
training, writes: "Psycho-pathology has to deal
with phenomena of consciousness, and that means
with contents of consciousness. The abnormality
must be manifested in these, if we wish to speak
of psychic abnormality at all. But we know prac-
tically nothing about the relation of the contents
of consciousness to the processes of the brain. The
effect of this lack of knowledge has become very
evident in psychology. Scarcely a psychologist ever
even thinks now of classifying psychic contents ac-
cording to their corresponding physical processes,
much less of attempting to investigate these con-
tents and processes with reference to any causal
connections. Is it a matter of only slight impor-
tance for the psycho-pathologist to understand the
qualitative and hence absolutely distinctive nature
of the psychic? Hardly, for he too must familiar-
ize himself with the idea that the content alone of
a psychic phenomenon is decisive in determining
whether it is abnormal or not. For plain everyday
experience proves this necessity." *
The psychic life, then, is the true sphere of reli-
gious "miracle." But here, too, it is unnecessary

Leipzig, 1906, pp. 82 f. See also his Die Grenzwissenschaften
der Psychologie, 1902.
77
to think of a "setting aside" of the laws of nature,
however little the religious disposition itself—its
development and unfolding—rests upon such a
"setting aside."
And now let us turn to the teleological argument.
78
Biology and the Christian Belief in God
IS there any such thing as teleology, or, at any
rate, a teleology that is scientifically tenable
and convincing? Is it really possible to establish
other than causal relations in nature? He who
holds that it is will consider, exclusively or at
least primarily, as the field in which such other re-
lations can be established, the field of organic na-
ture, that of living things, that is to say, the field
of biology.
A. Teleology in Organic Nature
The point at issue, however, is just whether this
field occupies a unique position in this respect.
From the writings of Haeckel, if from no other
sources, it is well known that wide circles of mod-
ern natural scientists, and especially such as dis-
play a general philosophical interest, take a decid-
edly negative attitude in the matter. Repeatedly
and with untiring zeal Haeckel impresses upon his
readers that all phenomena and facts even of the
organic world are without exception explicable and
intelligible under a purely mechanical causal view.
Mechanical causes alone, he urges, determine those
peculiar motor phenomena by which organisms
79
are distinguished from inorganic things, and which
we call life in the narrower sense. Not only in his
"Riddle of the Universe" but also in his most im-
portant scientific writings, Haeckel has maintained
this point of view, and quite recently he has again
given it special emphasis in his "Wonders of Life."
But he by no means stands alone in holding this
view. On the contrary it is the attitude of a large
number of modern natural scientists. In Roux and
his numerous disciples this conception has found
protagonists of greater scientific rigor than Haeckel.
In the mechanics of evolution, as he calls it, Roux
sees the real science of the future. He defines it
more closely as the causal science of organisms, and
he explains this to mean that it is, or must certainly
become, the science of the real formative causes, the
vera causa, to which the organic kingdom as a
whole, as well as every individual representative,
owes its origin.
In its beginnings this view and mode of thought
goes back to the middle of the last century, to the
time of the violent opposition against the theory
of vitalism. Natural philosophy, as well as philos-
ophy in general, used to explain the distinctive and
peculiar character of organic life by the hypothesis
of a special vital power, effective only in organisms
and constituting their special divine endowment.
The real characteristic of living creatures, as dis-
tinguished from inorganic nature, was seen in this
purposive active vital power, which was looked
upon as different from all physical and chemical
80
forces. Now there can be no doubt that this con-
cept and this theory of vital power have often been
misapplied in order to obscure certain problems or
to dismiss them without much ado. It was cus-
tomary to stop the discussion of all questions and
perplexities to which biological investigation led,
by referring to the vital power of divine origin as a
sufficient explanation of the phenomenon under
consideration. Hence it cannot be denied that the
opposition to vitalism was justified. In fact, this
theory is an impediment to scientific investigation
and that is a sufficient reason for giving it up al-
together, since its sole object is to explain certain
scientific problems. The well-known philosopher,
Lotze,32 was chiefly instrumental in opposing and
overcoming it. But, and here we come to the heart
of the matter, the way in which vitalism has often
been and is being combated in recent natural
science and natural philosophy, quite contrary to
Lotze's intentions, amounts at the same time to a
definite and positive conception of the nature of the
phenomena of life and of their relation to inorganic
nature. Implied in the theory of vitalism was the
idea that living phenomena cannot be fully ex-
plained and understood under a causal mechanical
view. But those representatives of modern natural
science who oppose vitalism, in fact, take the posi-
tion that they can be so explained. In the whole
domain of nature they recognize only causal rela-
tions, and hence they maintain that causality
reigns supreme in this domain. Now we have
81
already made it clear that absolute validity can
not be claimed for causality. The law of causality
does not govern the course of nature with absolute
necessity by virtue of its own comprehensive force,
but on the contrary it merely represents that order
which we meet with everywhere in nature as we
know it—as it comes to our understanding. On
this account it must be conceded that the law of
causality holds generally. But does it follow from
this general validity that we are justified in pro-
claiming causality alone to hold, and hence in
denying and contesting all other relations than the
mechanical and causal in the whole domain of
nature, including the phenomena of life? On
purely logical grounds, by no means. Taken in
the abstract, a system of facts constituting a
mechanical causal complex may at the same time
be a part of a purposive complex, or it may even
constitute the whole of such a complex. Indeed,
we see this in all machines and parts of machines,
for although they serve the definite purpose for
which they are constructed by human ingenuity,
their operation is, as a matter of fact, mechanical
and causal. Hence the only question arising is
this: What conclusion does the existing state of
facts demand or at least favor? And, precisely
by reason of recent biological research and dis-
covery, it seems to me that to this question we
may give the answer: The assertion of the exclusive
validity of causality is not only unjustifiable but
directly untenable.
82
To prove that this answer is correct, at least for
some of the most important cases in question, I shall
again take up the illustration of the machine. The
comparison of the living organism to a machine
comes to our mind almost as a matter of course,
and it has, in fact, frequently been made. But
since De la Mettrie coined the well-known phrase
"I'homme machine," it has often been used in sup-
port of precisely this purely mechanical causal
view, which is satisfied with chemical and physical
processes as a complete explanation of the nature
of living organisms. But the more discerning of
the natural philosophers of today admit that such
a comparison is really adverse, indeed fatal, to
this view. Reinke especially has strongly em-
phasized this fact, and in so doing he is in full
accord with philosophers proper, such as Lieb-
mann, Paulsen and Wundt. But even natural
scientists, not at all or only slightly interested in
philosophy, have recently expressed themselves to
the same effect. I refer the reader especially to
Oskar Hertwig, anatomist and biologist of Berlin,
particularly to his "Zeit- und Streitfragen der
Biologic" 33
For although I may be thoroughly familiar with
the various chemical and physical processes in-
volved in the operation of a machine, this is not
sufficient to give me any knowledge of its real
nature. For this it is necessary that the engineer
explain to me the plan of construction and the
definite appropriate arrangement of its various
83
parts. It is just this peculiar arrangement, due
to human intelligence, which is primarily char-
acteristic for the machine. It is made, indeed, of
the same materials which are ordinarily found in
nature, and it works with the same forces, and
according to the same laws, that we are accustomed
to see in nature. But in spite of this fact, the
machine differs fundamentally from all other man-
ifestations of nature, and leads to results which
do not occur anywhere else in nature. This is
due to the fact that human beings, acting with
rational and systematic understanding and de-
sign, have given the machine a definite form
which makes possible its new and specific achieve-
ments.
Now it is very similar with living organisms.
Chemical processes and physical properties alone
do not explain their peculiar and unique functions.
On the contrary, it is necessary to presuppose an
organization of elements peculiar to living organ-
isms—a machine-like arrangement or structure,
which is prerequisite to the phenomena of life,
just as the design evolved by rational thinking is
prerequisite to the machine.
Let us now briefly call to mind the most im-
portant of these specific functions of organisms.
It will then also become clear to what extent the
machine analogy characterizes their nature. How-
ever, this will only be by way of suggestion, and is
not intended to be exhaustive.
Nutrition, regeneration and propagation are the
84
three concepts which express the most essential
specific traits of the organic world.
Haeckel, among others, looks upon nutrition as
a purely chemico-physical process like the forma-
tion of crystals, for instance. Just as in the forma-
tion of crystals new particles are, according to
definite laws, continually deposited by accretion
on the already solid nucleus, so in nutrition, it is
claimed, similar conditions hold. But this analogy
is misleading, indeed it is absolutely false. For in
the nutritive process of organisms we have to do
not merely with a process of accretion, but with
internal and organic assimilation. And what is
more important, this consumption and assimilation
of food always takes place, from the lowest stages
of life up, according to a real selective choice. Even
those most primitive forms of life consisting of
simple cells or not even having the full value of a
complete cell, have the capacity of selecting nour-
ishment suitable for themselves and of sucking it
in for the purposes of assimilation. And what is
true of these primitive forms of life is true also of
those cell structures in the digestive organs of
higher forms of life whose function is the assimila-
tion of food. We know today that the reabsorption
of the walls of the intestines is due to the fact that
special cells here exercise the specific function of
absorbing suitable matter, and of passing it on for
further assimilation in the body.
Moreover, as regards the popular reference to
the formation of crystals, the fact must not be
85
overlooked that this already presents a difficult
problem in itself. Driesch has advocated the legiti-
mate and important distinction between "static"
and "dynamic" teleology. Thus the formation of
crystals falls within the domain of static teleology
and is, therefore, itself already teleological in
character.34
How great the natural capacity of regeneration
is in plants, animals and human beings is, at least
in general, familiar to all. I shall illustrate this
by an example which will at the same time clear
up still another problem of importance for our
whole investigation. The question is as to whether
relations and phenomena of a teleological nature,
that is to say, in any way purposive in character,
can be proved to hold in the realm of organic life.
However, for the present I avoid intentionally, for
a reason that will appear later, the expression
"purposive." It is obvious that the capacity of
regeneration can be profitably used as a positive
element of proof by the advocate of teleology.
Consequently the opponents of teleology have
made a systematic attempt to invalidate every line
of argument of this kind by referring to so-called
non-purposive or dysteleological facts and proc-
esses, contrasting them with such teleological phe-
nomena. Again Haeckel, more than anyone else,
has taken pains to collect all such dysteleological
facts that he could find, in order to found upon
them a special doctrine of dystelology*

It has often been observed that in craw-fish,
when an eye is destroyed, an antenna or feeler
similar to those of insects is produced instead of
another eye. Now in this production of a less
perfect to take the place of a more perfect sense
organ a non-purposiveness has been seen. Is it
purposive, it has been asked, for this entirely dif-
ferent and less perfect sense-organ to be innervated
by the optic nerve? And it has been answered:
"Here the teleological point of view breaks down,
for we are confronted with an aberration in the
teleological sense." 36 This case, which has been
much discussed in print as well as in meetings of
natural scientists, shows with all the clearness that
could be desired the logical absurdity of this, and
all similar objections raised against organic teleol-
ogy. The teleological character of regeneration is
not disproved by the fact that the latter has its
limitations. It would be entirely in line with this
line of argument, if one were to seek to establish
the absolute dysteleology, non-purposiveness and
miscarriage of organic nature as a whole, by point-
ing out that, with very few exceptions, living
creatures do not grow a new head after it has once
been severed. Logically such manifest nonsense
differs only in degree from Haeckel's assertion that
in very many cases the purposiveness of organiza-
tion is only apparent, and that more exact anatom-
ical and physiological investigation often shows
that "even very highly developed organs of seem-
ingly well designed construction exhibit great me-
87
chanical defects." 36 The general point of view
under which all such objections must be considered
is obviously this: we may not definitely decide the
question of teleological relations and phenomena
according to our desires and the state of our
knowledge, we may not demand a subjective an-
thropopathic teleology, but we must acknowledge
the objective empirical teleology. This makes
it incumbent upon us to go still deeper into the
whole problem and we shall now attempt so to do.
The so-called teleological proof for the existence
of God consists in concluding the existence of a
designing creator from the purposive order of
nature. But a peculiar difficulty presents itself
against such an attempt. The concept of purpose
is rooted in inner experience. Whatever arises
from a decision for a purpose is purposeful and
purposive. Consequently, in order to be quite sure
that any result is purposive, we must know that
it arises from a decision for a purpose, from an
act of will of an intelligent being. From purposive-
ness we seek to draw the conclusion that there is
an intelligent will, and yet we can only recognize
a result as purposive on the supposition of an in-
telligent act of will. In the last analysis we cannot
avoid this circle. However, we cannot for this
reason simply drop the question, or we should for
similar reasons actually have to abandon scientific
investigation altogether.
On the contrary, we shall have to find the best
criterion we can to characterize results as pur-
88
posive, disregarding the fact that we know their
origin to lie in the will of consciously purposive
intelligences. If we want to treat the matter sys-
tematically, we shall take up the highest products
of the purposive activity of human intelligence,
and inquire what is characteristic of them. These
highest purposive human products are such systems
as are complete within themselves, and whose com-
ponent parts serve the purpose of realizing a con-
sistent end. Here we have a criterion which is far-
reaching in enabling us to investigate and to judge
objectively. To be sure, the objectivity of judg-
ment does not extend directly to the characteristic
of purposiveness, but only to that of being directed
toward an end. For the present the possibility
must be left open that these ends may be random
and accidental. Von Baer deserves the chief credit
for having introduced the concept of directedness
toward an end into natural science and natural
philosophy, and for having insisted that phenomena
of this kind must be recognized as real.37 How-
ever, he makes a clear distinction between purpose
and end. Now, since this distinction seems to me
to be both real and important, I consider the
polemic which Reinke has recently started on this
point against Baer to be a step backward.*
The truth of the matter really is that directedness
of nature toward an end can be made an object of
purely empirical scientific investigation while this
cannot be done with the purposiveness of nature.
* See Anm. 38, Reinke's Dominanten.
89
It is a further question, lying beyond the domain
of the exact sciences and capable of being dealt
with only by philosophical reflection, whether the
facts falling under the head of directedness toward
an end must be interpreted as purposive results.
Since the Greek terms teleology and teleological
have the more general meaning, comprising both
the concept of directedness toward an end and that
of purposiveness, we can properly speak of an
empirical teleology, as has recently been done.
The question formulated above may then be re-
stated: Does an empirical teleology lead necessarily
to a metaphysical teleology?
Of course the answer to this question must de-
pend upon the scope and nature of empirical
teleology. This brings us back to our discussion
above.
B. Propagation and Evolution as the Culmin-
ation of Organic Teleology
It still remains for us to consider propagation
as the third specific characteristic of living organ-
isms. For it is in this that their teleological char-
acter finds its strongest expression.
Natural philosophy as well as philosophy in
general formerly sought to explain the great enigma
presenting itself in the fact of reproduction, by the
so-called theory of preformation. This theory as-
sumed that the germ or beginning of every living
creature already, only on an infinitely reduced
90
scale, represents the developed individual in ques-
tion. The germ must be looked upon, it was
claimed, as an extremely small image of the com-
pletely developed individual, the imperfections of
our sense-organs alone preventing our recognizing
this miniature image as an exact copy. The whole
ontogenetic course of development, even in the
early embryonic stages, was accordingly taken to
be a simple process of growth by nutrition. In
order to preserve the real continuity of the develop-
ment, which is the real enigma, it was further held
that all the germs of any particular species were
from the very beginning contained in the first germ
of that species. Accordingly, it was calculated that
Eve, for example, was created with an endowment
of two hundred billion germs of human beings.
This theory of preformation is today untenable,
not primarily, as most people will think to begin
with, on account of the absurd numbers involved,
for no limit can be set, after all, either as a maxi-
mum or as a minimum. But it is untenable be-
cause we know today that the germ of every living
creature is originally a single cell * like all those of
which the completely formed creature consists, and
consequently, that cell segmentation and cell divi-
* More exactly, the ovum as well as the sperm cell, on whose
union propagation depends (in so far as this does not take place
by simple division or parthenogenesis) have in form and function
the value of elementary organisms. In particular, the cell nuclei
are, as recent investigations have made at least highly probable,
the real vehicles of reproduction, just as in the union of ovum
and sperm a union of their nuclei is primarily involved.
91
sion represent the first stages of embryonic develop-
ment. Hence the germ, the simple cell cannot be
an image of the complete creature and cannot be
organized like the latter.
The problem confronting us in reproduction is
then really this: How does it happen that organ-
isms are developed from simple cells that are al-
ways like, in kind and constitution, those from
which these cells have been detached? Since all
germs of all living creatures are uniformly simple
cells, how can such a cell invariably develop in such
a way as to conform to the species in question?
Never does a blade of grass or an apple tree grow
from the germ of a lemon seed, never does a turtle
or an elephant develop from the egg of an ant, never
does a sea-eagle or a humming-bird arise from the
blastocyst of a pigeon egg!
Nevertheless, people have tried to comprehend
this fact, whose wonder only seems to increase the
more it is reflected upon, by purely causal mechan-
ical considerations, and with a rigid exclusion of
all teleological reflection. The so-called idioplasm
theory of the late botanist, Nageli of Munich, and
the germ-plasm theory of the biologist, Weismann,
are especially deserving of mention among the the-
ories advanced to serve this purpose. As is recog-
nized by natural scientists and philosophers, they
are by far the most important of these attempts.
These theories are of interest and importance for
us by reason of the fact that they bring out the full
significance of the problem before us. In fact, both
92
theories do this in essentially the same way. Their
differences appear only in their finer details. For
our purpose it is sufficient to discuss the fundamen-
tal idea common to both theories.
Since all organisms, despite their extreme diver-
sity, are developed from simple cells of microscopic
size, it follows that these germ cells themselves—
this is the fundamental idea common to both the-
ories—cannot really be the ultimate and the most
elemental units of life, but must themselves be
highly complex in structure or highly composite in
their organization. Every germ cell must be a ver-
itable microcosm. For only thus is the infinite va-
riety of development possible. Nageli calls the
hypothetical component elements of the cell mi-
cells,* and, as a result of certain calculations, he
finds that a mass of protoplasm equal to one-thou-
sandth of a cubic millimeter contains about four
millions of them.
Now, to be sure, this calculation is really of con-
sequence only from the view-point of epistemology
or from that of the infinitesimal calculus. These
two fields here have a common interest.
The same reflection must of course be repeated
for the individual mi-cells. It follows, then, as I
have already stated, that every cell is really a mi-
crocosm, a true universe. While, on the other
hand, if we start a little farther on in the series con-
stituting the system of infinitesimal equations
which we can and must look upon as constituting

93
the world, then even the solar system to which our
earth belongs and which, in spite of Galileo, New-
ton and Laplace, indeed, in spite of the undulatory
theory and spectrum analysis, we still like so much
to regard as the universe pure and simple, then, I
say, even this solar system appears as a mere grain
of dust in the universe.
On the other hand, every individual cell is after
all a real universe! And hence the result of our
whole discussion of reproduction is exactly this:
we must regard the very component elements of
livings things—the individual cells—as entities of
a most highly complicated organization. Even
these individual cells have a machine-like struc-
ture, but, as we know by experience, the end which
this machine-like structure serves, and to which
it leads, lies infinitely beyond all achievements
which human intelligence and energy can attain.
For it serves the end of securing the continuity of
life. A superb teleology, a most comprehensive
directedness toward an end, is discernible in or-
ganic nature, even when we consider individual
living creatures as such. If philosophers like Spen-
cer, Hartmann and Wundt interpret these teleo-
logical facts, which they accept, in the sense of a
pantheism, however it may be defined in detail,
we shall still have to grant them the possibility of
such an interpretation. But it is certainly not the
only possible interpretation, nor indeed the one
most naturally suggesting itself, nor the one best
founded. By every analogy of experience the in-
94
terpretation meeting these requirements is un-
doubtedly that which the Christian religion con-
tains in its belief in a personal God.
After all perhaps it is not a mere accident that
a natural scientist like Reinke,38 having once come
to accept the justice and demonstrability of the
teleological view of the organic word, is ready even
before professional philosophers (to whom the de-
tails of the teleological order are not as clear and
familiar as to himself) to declare faith in a personal
creator to be the only key with which we can, at
least, attempt to solve the riddle presented by those
facts. He writes: "Reasoning by the methods of
induction and analogy, the natural scientist will
find that reducing the nature and the existence of
organisms to a creating deity is not only the most
plausible but the only conceivable explanation—
for him this follows with convincing logic from the
facts." * This statement we must certainly limit
and set right from an epistemological point of view,
but with such limitation it seems to me to be en-
tirely warranted. And within this limitation,
Reinke's argument directed especially against pan-
theism is relevant, namely: "The machine-like
structure of plants and animals is incompatible
with pantheism, for the inventor and master work-
man are inseparably bound up with the concept
machine" (p. 464).
With all this, however, we have thus far merely
crossed the threshold of the teleological order of
* Die Welt als Tat, 1899, p. 457.
95
nature. In terms of the illustration already sev-
eral times used, we have considered the various
parts of the machine and grasped their teleological
character. Let us now turn our attention to the
whole range of living organisms, as it constitutes
a gradually ascending line of ever higher and higher
forms of life. For the world of living things con-
stitutes a connected whole, and when we consider
it above all, as it seems to me we must, from the
point of view of evolution, it represents a great
work of art, which is self-perfecting in the sense
that the lower forms of life lead to higher and higher
forms.
Hence I am certainly of the opinion that the
doctrine of evolution and the Christian belief in
God not only do not conflict but, on the contrary,
that they are mutually complementary—I might
almost say that each is necessary to the other.
The Christian belief in God alone comprehends
the riddle propounded by the theory of evolution—
it does not solve but it comprehends this riddle.39
For it is most especially under the conception of
evolution that the world of living things seems like
a work of art, in comparison with which even the
most elaborate human works of art are but very
imperfect imitations. It appears as a work of art
in which innumerable distinct elements serve the
single purpose of developing ever more perfect
forms of life, from the lowest stages of unicellular
organisms or such, indeed, that do not even have
the value of a complete cell in form, and with only
96
an extremely vague sensibility, up to the highest
stage where rational and religious moral life be-
comes possible, and with it conscious and respon-
sible personal beings. Only in this sense and to
this extent is the theory of evolution in the domain
of organic life a well-founded hypothesis. Even
then it is no more than an hypothesis. Compared
with the unscientific exaggerations which we find
in this respect in Haeckel's publications, and all
the more in those of the popular authors of his
school, it is at all events of value that strictly pro-
fessional natural scientists have recently empha-
sized most vigorously the hypothetical character
of the whole theory of the origin of the species, of
the theory of evolution in the domain of organic
life, and have reverted to a complete repudiation
of it.* But considered from a higher philosophical
point of view this must be adjudged a hasty
narrowness.
For in the sense explained the doctrine of evolu-
tion is really a well-founded hypothesis, one of the
best founded hypotheses, in fact, of all science, and
there are certainly much stronger arguments in
favor of it than there are in favor of the opposing
hypothesis of the independent creation of all the
various genera or species of organic life. For it
must be conceded by everyone who is not willing
* The chief representative of this line of thought is the zo-
ologist Alb. Fleischmann of Erlangen. Concerning him and his
lectures "Uber den Auf- und Niedergang einer wissenschaftlichen
Hypothese," see Anm. o.
97
to defend to the utmost the verbal inspiration
theory of the Scriptures of the seventeenth century
that the theory of independent creation is, from
our point of view, nothing more than an hypothesis.
Proof that the doctrine of evolution or the theory
of descent is one of the best established hypotheses
of science is derived especially from three branches
of knowledge: comparative biology or comparative
botany and zoology, paleontology or the science of
organisms living in earlier periods of the earth's
development, and ontogeny or the inquiry into the
life-history of individual organisms.
Comparative biology teaches that the demarca-
tions of the various species of living organisms
are frequently not fixed but uncertain and fluc-
tuating. Natural science, as well as philosophy,
had formerly considered the distinctive differences
of the various species to be absolutely fixed and
immutable. But this position has become un-
tenable with the broadening of our knowledge of
the plant and animal world. Varieties and sub-
species often represent connecting intermediary
forms, and hence a systematic demarcation and
classification becomes a mere makeshift, useful
only for practical purposes. Similar conditions
obtain for genera and higher groups. However,
we must keep in mind that there are, in the veg-
etable as well as in the animal kingdom, a certain
number of distinctively organized groups or types
which are not, at least immediately, reducible to
one another. On the contrary, as compared with
98
the older view, recent investigation has proved the
necessity of increasing the number of such distinct
groups.40
Paleontology has established three facts which
tend to support the theory of evolution. It has
shown, first, that in the different periods of the
history of the earth correspondingly different forms
of life have been developed, and that these forms
did not remain the same throughout all these
periods. Secondly, it points out that the successive
forms of life found in the various strata of the
earth and representing the different periods of its
history, constitute a progressive line of develop-
ment, inasmuch as the simpler forms predominate
in earlier while higher forms always occur in the
later periods. Finally, paleontology teaches that
among extinct species there are some which may,
with a certain degree of justice, be regarded as
intermediary and transitional forms.41
So far, however, the efforts to establish a con-
tinuous progressive line of development have met
with so little success as to make it highly improba-
ble that any material advance will ever be made
in this direction. It should be specifically men-
tioned that no form has yet been discovered which
might with certainty be regarded as an inter-
mediary form which really fills the gap between
the highest orders of quadrupeds living today and
man.42
Ontogeny teaches that every higher organism
must, in the process of its development, pass
99
through forms which characterize lower organisms.
A particularly striking example is the branchial
stage in the development of the embryo of higher
vertebrates. On the basis of this fact Haeckel has
formulated what he calls the fundamental bioge-
netic law, namely, that the process of development
of the individual is a rapid and contracted reca-
pitulation of the history of the species. In this form
and broad generality, to be sure, the "fundamental
biogenetic law" is open to very serious objection.
But the careful formulation just given does express
a real state of facts, such facts, indeed, as in them-
selves lead to the theory of evolution, or better, to
a theory of evolution.43
Thus we have three groups of facts supporting
the theory of evolution. By reason of the agree-
ment and mutual corroborative character of these
facts this theory becomes one of the best estab-
lished hypotheses of all science. Of course the
possibility must be left open that this development
cannot, after all, be looked upon as taking place,
without break and unalterably, in an absolutely
continuous line. On account of the restrictions and
provisos which we had to make with respect to
each of these groups of facts, we are forced to recog-
nize this possibility. Moreover, various empirical
data tend directly to substantiate such a position.
It is always a matter of method for us to take into
account every supposition which is unfavorable to
us as a representative of the Christian belief in
God. Every modification and every point yielded
100
in the direction mentioned is a concession to our
own position. It is just for this reason that we
deem it sufficient to have established the fact that
the necessity of such modifications does not by any
means lie outside the realm of real scientific reflec-
tion about the doctrine of evolution. However,
we shall not, at present, make any direct use of
this restriction, but on the contrary we shall accept
precisely the other possibility, namely, that .there
is really a continuous unbroken development from
a first beginning up to an ultimate .final stage.
For as a possibility this must certainly. be held
valid.
Now would the fact of such a development
jeopardize the Christian belief in God? I have
already emphatically answered this question in
the negative. But since we now know more about
the facts supporting this theory, I can treat this
question more fully. It certainly cannot be denied
that, considered and interpreted from the point of
view of evolution, we have before us in organic
life a system of facts of empirical teleology. But,
more than this it is a system of empirical teleolog-
ical facts for the understanding of which a met-
aphysical teleology is absolutely required. For in
the face of these facts the strictly mechanical and
causal position is pure nonsense. Perhaps it might
be conceivable that a watch, an organ or a micro-
scope could, in the course of millions of years, and
as the result of a fortuitous concurrence of circum-
stances and of the bringing together by chance
IOI
of the various component parts, be produced by
a purely causal mechanical process, although I
think this highly improbable. But that cells could
originate spontaneously and accidentally, cells
which are capable of segmenting and dividing, of
developing into a morula and blastula, of expand-
ing into endodermic, ectodermic and mesodermic
tissues,44 and thus finally of producing most com-
plex organisms up to man himself, who subjects the
. very jubfverse to his questions and investigations,
or, to use dnce more the words of Dubois Reymond,
"(Ml&tapafele of bringing about a development of a
primordial bacillus into a palm grove, of a prim-
itive micrococcus into Suleima's graceful mien and
Newton's philosophical brain—to maintain that
such cells could have originated accidentally by
a purely causal mechanical process is madness,
even though there be method in it. It would be
much more plausible to hold that the facts adduced
and which represent such a complicated work of
art, point unmistakably to a master-builder who
sets and realizes definite purposes and to whose
conscious and purposive intention the origin and
development of life owes its beginning.
C. Interpretation and Delimitation of the
Concept of Evolution
A posteriori this conclusion is, of course, by no
means imperative, since the pantheistic explanation
remains open as a possibility. Nevertheless, this
102
interpretation of the Christian belief in God is un-
doubtedly reasonable, and, viewed from a purely
scientific standpoint, it has the great advantage
over the pantheistic interpretation that the analogy
of experience is in its favor, and that it avoids the
difficulties to which the latter inevitably leads.
For the simple fact, which is all that is given us
as a matter of experience, the fact of the realization
of purposes by self-conscious and purposive intelli-
gences, brings to naught every attempt to give this
pantheistic interpretation a more intelligible form.
When, in spite of this, the attempt is made, the
result is altogether arbitrary and fantastic construc-
tions. That Hartmann's "unconscious absolute"
is such a construction is almost the unanimous
opinion of all philosophers today. But even Wundt,
who has frequently expressed this opinion most
forcibly, nevertheless finally comes, in his own at-
tempt to give this pantheistic interpretation a more
intelligible form, to a conception closely related to
that of Hartmann, and for this very reason it falls
under his own criticism of unconscious mind as a
self-contradictory concept. For, in spite of all the
efforts of Hartmann and his followers, to maintain
a speculative concept, set up a priori, by subse-
quent epistemological and psychological argu-
ment, Wundt is manifestly right when he empha-
sizes the fact that the concept of mind springs
from our own inner experience, that it is, therefore,
bound to our consciousness, that consequently
everything pertaining to mind is conscious mental
103
activity, and that, as a result, "unconscious mind"
is a self-contradictory concept.*
But is not the concept to which the problem un-
der consideration reduces with Wundt, the concept,
namely, of the "spontaneous generation of the or-
ganic world," similarly self-contradictory? And
after all, would not such a "spontaneous generation
of the organic world" presuppose "unconscious
mental activity" as the ultimate and primary force
of the universe?
Nor does the law of heterogony of purposes, ad-
duced by Wundt to make this spontaneous genera-
tion intelligible, eliminate the difficulty mentioned.
This law does, indeed, express a real fact, namely:
that in the organic world definite acts, originally
controlled by the will, bring about permanent
changes which facilitate and perfect such acts, and
thus gradually lead to a steady increase in effec-
tiveness beyond the end first sought. However,
this heterogony of purposes, and the correspond-
ing gradual self-perfecting of the organic world,
applies only to the way in which the ascending
process of development takes place, but not to
the sum total of the facts of organic development
on their own merits. Because, as Wundt himself
* In his "System der Philosophie," 2d ed., p. 559, Wundt says
explicitly: "The assumption, by reason of any objective indica-
tions, that there is a mental content, is justified only where the
latter must be interpreted as acts of a consciousness similar to
our own, however different its stage of development may be."
Consistently maintained, this insight leads to a result beyond
Wundt's own pantheism.
104
admits,* the creative energy which is at work in
organic nature, never consists in an absolutely new
creation, but always in an unending and continual
differentiation and intensification of acts accom-
plished, which are given originally in their simplest
form. When the matter is taken as a whole the
argument based upon this "creative energy" is
inadequate. What must be thought of the final
result of Wundt's discussion follows from the pre-
ceding. He writes: "Even if the contemplation of
organic nature makes it probable that the purpos-
siveness displayed in the organization of living
forms has sprung from a purposive will, there is no
reason whatever for assuming that this purposive
will lies outside the organisms themselves, since
experience teaches us, in fact, to recognize the
volitional acts of animals as important and funda-
mental factors in the adaptation of their organs." f
This statement is not positively erroneous. But
in this form, the assertion that there is no reason
whatever for assuming the purposive will, which,
even according to Wundt, must be posited, to lie
outside of organisms themselves, must be chal-
lenged. Really it can only be said that for a purely
theoretical and scientific consideration there is no
reason absolutely compelling us to make this as-
sumption. But it is the assumption easiest to
understand and best founded.
Still less than that of Wundt can the view of
Ostwald serve as a valid objection to our position.
* Cf. op. tit., p. 332 f. f Op. tit., p. 432 f.
i°5
In the world-view derived from energetics, which
Ostwald promulgates, he seeks to establish the
concept of energy not only as the fundamental
concept of theoretical physics, but beyond this as
the fundamental philosophical or metaphysical
concept. Hence he undertakes to reduce both in-
organic and organic processes to laws of energy,
and therefore finally to explain the organic as the
product of inorganic laws of nature. Indeed he
claims that organic life with all its functions and
manifestations is derivable from such laws of en-
ergy. In all of these, that is to say, we have to do
at most with special kinds or forms of energy which
may and actually do change into one another.
Consciousness and mental activity, too, are, ac-
cording to this view, only a special form of energy,
or at least depend upon such a form. Now it is
neither necessary nor possible for us to enter here
into a criticism of the whole of this fundamental
conception built up on "energetics." The un-
certainty implied in the preceding and which Ost-
wald is unable to overcome constitutes the real
weak point in the conception. All that is of interest
to us here is the way in which Ostwald, in order to
find further support for his position as an advocate
of energetics, deals with the problem of teleology.
His aim is nothing more nor less than pointing out
a way in which "the problem of the purposiveness
of organisms seemingly so extremely intricate"
may be made, at least in principle, to lose its enig-
matical character. To accomplish this end he
106
would let the concept of purposiveness apply only
to the term of life of organisms. Whatever in-
creases this term of life he calls purposive and what-
ever climinishes it he calls non-purposive. How-
ever, this term of life must not be understood to
refer to the individual organism, but, in accordance
with the law of heredity, to the species. And here
he holds that Darwin's idea of the survival of the
fittest furnishes a sufficient explanation. So this
explanation is held to follow from recognition of
the fact that those forms remain which happen to
be most virile, and this just because the other less
virile forms are swept away by the current of time.
But this amounts to an arbitrary limitation and
restriction of the problem, and to giving then a
solution which is truly only too "trivial." * The
teleological problem does not begin to reach its full
depth when it is considered only with reference to
duration in time. To get at its full depth we must
expressly keep in mind the ascending line of devel-
opment leading always to higher forms of life, and
we must take into consideration also the highest
form of life as exhibited in the religious and moral
consciousness of man. But it is just at this point
that Ostwald's conception, based as it is purely on
"energetics," breaks down completely.
After this discussion of this newest form of nat-
* On page 434 of his "Vorlesungen fiber Naturphilosophie,"
Ostwald himself says: "We arrive at the absolutely trivial prop-
osition: Of the forms of organisms, those last longest which are
most lasting."
107
ural philosophy it still devolves upon us to define
our position toward Darwinism. For this is neces-
sary in order to complete the argument.
I have been using the concepts evolution and
doctrine or theory of evolution in the broader
sense, taking them to mean quite generally the
philosophical attitude which takes account of a
gradual development of organic nature. Only this
can be upheld as a well-grounded hypothesis.
Darwin's special theory of selection, even though
it is still sometimes treated as identical with the
doctrine of evolution in general, is not a well-
grounded hypothesis. Basing its argument upon
the doctrine of natural selection especially, this
theory of Darwin has the definite aim of establish-
ing the process of evolution as altogether natural
and causal mechanical. But at least when it claims
to make the process of evolution completely in-
telligible, that is to say, when it claims to be the
sufficient and complete explanation of the pro-
gressive development of organization, this theory
of selection cannot be accepted as a legitimate
hypothesis. For as soon as we go into the logical
consequences of the theory of selection as thus
understood, we find ourselves everywhere con-
fronted with logical absurdities and contradictions.
Over and over again we are forced to conclude that
natural selection must in some way have played a
part in the process of evolution of organic nature,
'but at the same time, also, that it does not by any
means furnish the sole and sufficient explanation
108
for the progressive development. It may be stated
as a fact that today all professional philosophers
without exception hold the view of Darwinism just
presented, and that among natural scientists, too,
those having a certain measure of philosophical
insight take a view which at least approaches this
conception.
I shall make it clear that this position (the re-
jection of the theory of natural selection) is justi-
fied and necessary, by discussing briefly a few of
the most salient points.
The theory of natural selection operates with
three concepts: variability, heredity and selection
through the struggle for existence. Variability or
capacity of modification—adaptability in partic-
ular—undoubtedly exists in the world of living
things. But whether it is present to the extent that
the application of the doctrine of natural selection
would require is another question. But I shall ad-
mit even this. But an insurmountable difficulty
is presented by the additional assumption which
then becomes necessary, the assumption, namely:
that variability uniformly, or certainly in an over-
whelming majority of cases, acts in the direction
of greater perfection, or, in other words, that va-
riability is progressive. Have the purely accidental
conditions of life always been suitable to the pro-
motion of higher forms and higher degrees of de-
velopment? If we are to judge by a purely
empirical study of variability, this is by no
means the case. For we find fluctuations that
109
hinder as well as those that further the develop-
ment of the organism and as many of one as of
the other.
The general theory of heredity does not need to
be considered in dealing with the doctrine of nat-
ural selection. Only so-called progressive hered-
ity—the transmission of newly acquired charac-
teristics—comes into consideration. For in fact,
heredity tends exactly to maintain specific differ-
ences and is conservative in character. Now I
shall disregard the fact that the whole matter of
such a progressive heredity has recently been the
subject of much controversy.* Let us proceed on
the ground that such progressive heredity actually
exists, for if we do not have in mind isolated indi-
vidual variations but such as often recur when
definite and uniform conditions obtain, this pro-
gressive heredity must, in my opinion, be held to
exist. However, it must be admitted that this
general kind of progressive heredity is rather ex-
ceptional, whereas, according to the theory of nat-
ural selection, it ought to be the rule if not a uni-
versal law. For the progressive development could
only be explained by progressive heredity if the
latter predominated.
The assumption of discrimination in the struggle
for existence is justified by the analogy of artificial
discrimination in scientific breeding. But although
scientific breeding has the advantage in many re-
spects over natural selection, since it is here pos-
* Compare Anm. n.
no
sible to restrict propagation absolutely to the fit-
test representatives of the species, all that has ever
been achieved by means of it is the production of
a definite range of new forms closely related to the
parent form. Every process of artificial selection
has a limit beyond which every attempt at fur-
ther development fails. Since this is true in arti-
ficial selection, it is by all odds most probable that
natural selection, or selection through the struggle
for existence, is also limited in its capacity of pro-
ducing deviations, and consequently, that it is not,
in the last analysis, the decisive cause of, but
merely contributory to, the evolutionary process.
The same conclusion is reached by a closer study
of those cases of the operation of natural selection
which Darwin and his successors are so fond of
citing, namely: the cases of so-called mimicry—
of mimicking or masquerading for the purposes of
protection. In all kinds of mimicry—protective
coloration, assuming the aspect of certain natural
objects, or that of related but better protected spe-
cies—the result is that better chances in the strug-
gle for existence are gained. But does natural
selection offer a sufficient explanation of the devel-
opment of such mimicry? It is assumed to have
developed gradually from the most meager begin-
nings. But natural selection could become effective
only after a point is reached where the deviation
is so decided as to be of advantage, where the imi-
tation is so good as to mislead the enemy. Hence
another principle or another cause must have been
in
operative to bring about the development up to
that point.
We have now considered each of the three most
salient factors upon which the theory of natural
selection relies. In conclusion let us look briefly
at the theory as a whole. It would explain the
variation and perfection of species by pointing out
that those individuals having such characteristics as
are best adapted to the prevailing conditions of life,
regularly have the best chance of surviving and of
transmitting their characteristics to their offspring.
But this leaves completely unanswered the ques-
tion as to how such characteristics which later
prove useful in the struggle for existence originally
came into being. This question is not answered
because it is really not taken into account. An-
other question also remains unanswered, the ques-
tion, namely: as to how the continued and pro-
gressive perfecting of species is to be brought about
by this process, since it is difficult to see why even
very low forms should not satisfy the principle of
utility with which natural selection alone operates.
It has very properly been asked, what good would
it do an amoeba, a worm or an insect to be more
highly organized, what advantage could a higher
stage of development bring to it? And on the other
hand, if it was really nothing but the mechanically
necessary effect of natural selection which occa-
sioned the perfection of organization, and in the
course of millions of years led up to the highest
stage of development, the question may and must
be raised as to why organisms of the simplest form
still exist. Did no change ever take place in them
which might have furnished an opportunity for
natural selection to set in? Yet unrestricted vari-
ability is a basic tenet of the theory of selection!
Or were such changes, if they did occur in isolated
individuals, never in the course of millions of years
transmitted to their offspring? Yet heredity is the
second fundamental tenet of the theory of selection'
Or, finally, did these organisms always find such
conditions of life that such a selection was never
called for? Yet existing conditions of such a nature
as to lead to selection constitute the third basic
tenet of the doctrine of selection!
As soon, therefore, as the logical consequences
of the fundamental ideas of this theory of selection
are developed, incongruities are everywhere met
with, and we are invariably led to feel that, while
natural selection probably played a r6le in the
evolution of organic nature, it can by no means
serve as an adequate and sufficient explanation of
the progressive development of organization. For
such an explanation we shall always find it neces-
sary to fall back upon a developmental principle
operating from within and having the character of
being directed toward an end, a principle which
does not depend exclusively upon purely accidental
conditions, and which in its turn is best and most
intelligibly explained in the world-view of the
Christian belief in God.
To be sure, Haeckel, in the last edition of his
"3
"History of Creation," continues to hold to the
theory of selection. "The struggle for existence is
just as effective in natural breeding, as far as mod-
ification and selection are concerned, as is the will
of man in scientific breeding. Only the latter
proceeds systematically and consciously, while the
former proceeds unsystematically and unconsciously.
This enables us to understand why results which
are adequate to meet the conditions can be pro-
duced by mechanical causes operating without
purpose, just as well as by ultimate aims which
are purposive in character. The products of nat-
ural breeding are just as purposive in character
as the scientific results achieved by man, and even
more so. Yet they do not owe their origin to a
purposive creative power, but to a mechanical
condition operating unconsciously and without
purpose." * And again he writes: "When we con-
sider the whole course of the evolutionary develop-
ment of related forms from a comparative point
of view, we see clearly how natural breeding,
though operating aimlessly in all directions, slowly
brings about a gradual perfecting, finally attaining,
after many futile attempts, results like those which
are purposive in character, and this by chance." f
Such statements must forthwith be condemned
by all who are capable of thinking correctly and
logically. Among natural scientists, too, such a
condemnation is steadily gaining ground. Follow-

ing the precedent of men like Wigand, Gustav
Wolff and Driesch they are coming more and more
generally to acknowledge that a rigorous main-
tenance of Darwin's theory would mean a mon-
strous distortion of the facts given in organic
nature.46 Thus, for instance, the zoologist, Pauli,
writes: "It runs counter to the logical faculty
with which all of us are endowed, to refer to chance
the building up of bodies consisting of a complicated
system of parts, representing various sorts of mate-
rial, standing in a relationship of dependence upon
one another, joined together as a unit, comprising
regulative processes, thinking and acting. . . .
To succeeding generations, it will appear as a
paradox in the thinking of our time that science
dared to ignore this logical compulsion from which
man can never be freed, and Darwin could not have
fallen into a contrary mode of thinking, if this
serious error of judgment, with which his unfor-
tunate principle was connected, had not been
obscured in his mind by genuine teleology.*
In conclusion I must add the following remark
with regard to the doctrine of evolution as it has
been interpreted above. If we subordinate this
doctrine to the Christian belief in God, a conception
follows forthwith which, although it adheres to a
real development in the true sense of the word—
to a gradual unfolding of life in accordance with
the powers and possibilities put into the organic
world to begin with by God, nevertheless at the

same time holds the unceasing providential super-
vision of this development by God to be self-
evident, and deems the latter to be excluded by
the former just as little as it deems the former to
be imperiled by the latter.
Psychology and the Christian Belief in
God
IN the foregoing we have discussed the relation
of religious faith to certain fields of knowl-
edge, and to certain judgments and problems with
which it is not itself directly and immediately
concerned. As yet we have either not taken up
religious faith in its uniqueness—its peculiar mo-
tives, interests and tendencies—at all, or else we
have only incidentally and occasionally referred
to them. For religious belief does not spring from
knowledge of the outer world, but from those inner
experiences and convictions which, welling up from
the depth of our souls, force themselves upon us.
The subject we are now to discuss, however,
allows us to gain an insight into faith in its own
province and in its own language. If we would
begin again with the traditional attempts of the
ecclesiastic-theological argumentation, it is the so-
called ontological proof for the existence of God—
in various forms and nuances, of course,—with
which we now have to deal.
I shall discuss briefly only the most familiar and
the most characteristic of these various forms of
the argument. It originated with the scholastic
117
philosopher Anselm (died iioo), and is to be found
in his work entitled "Proslogium."
Anselm begins with prayerful meditation: "Lord
God, Thou who givest understanding to faith,
grant to me, so far as Thou deemest it beneficial
for me, that I may understand that Thou art,
as we believe, and that Thou art what we believe
Thee to be."
"But we believe," he continues, 'that Thou art
the absolutely supreme being (aliquid quo mains
cogitari nequit)."
With this as a basis he attempts to establish his
proof. He argues that the concept of the absolutely
supreme being, which he urges to be indispensable
for human thinking, cannot be a mere mental
image, that is to say, a mere illusion (cannot exist
merely in the mind). For if it were a mere mental
image it could not be the idea of an absolutely su-
preme being at all, since a being still higher would
then be conceivable, namely, any actually existing
being. Therefore the concept of the absolutely
supreme being must either be left altogether un-
thought, or else it must be held to designate an
actually existing absolutely supreme being. The
former, he asserts, is impossible, and therefore only
the latter alternative remains.
The valid criticism of this ontological proof was
very precisely formulated by Kant as follows:
existence being not simply one of various attributes
of a concept but a matter or problem to itself, the
existence of a thing, in the broadest sense of the
118
word, can never be deduced from its concept. This
is quite right and it disposes of the ontological proof
as proof. But it does not dispose of Anselm's line
of thought or of the psychological problem which
he set up. For obviously that problem is this:
How does mankind happen to have the concept
of an absolutely supreme, an absolutely infinite
being at all?
Man knows himself to be only a finite being,
and likewise, he knows the world in which he is
placed to be only a world of finite phenomena. In
spite of this, how does he get the idea of an
absolutely infinite, an absolutely supreme being,
exalted above the whole mass of phenomena, indeed
exalted above absolutely all phenomena, whether
he knows them or merely conceives them to be
possible? For although the Christian belief in God
is by no means exhausted thereby, it certainly con-
tains this idea most explicitly and forcibly. And
every form of belief in God manifestly contains a
more or less distinct feeling of this idea. How,
then, does man happen to have this idea? For him
it means, in truth, an entirely different world—
another world beside the world of sense and phe-
nomena which is known to him, and of which he is
himself a part. For this world of sense and phe-
nomena the idea of God is altogether useless and
entirely devoid of meaning. This world is every-
where finite, limited and relative. Should we not,
therefore, suppose that no ideas but those of finite
and relative entities could ever arise in the human
119
mind, or at least that this absolutely different idea,
if it should at any time arise, would at once and
forever be recognized as empty?
It cannot be said as a rejoinder that the history
of human mental life presents more than enough
conceptions and ideas which correspond to no
reality: dragons and sea-serpents, pigmies and
giants, witches and afrites, and other things of this
kind. For all of these are within the possible limits
of the world of sense and phenomena, and generally
even have definite analogies or foundations in it.
Genuine spooks and ghosts are always in some way
connected with religious faith. They are creations
of a naive and childish or of a pathological religious
imagination, or at least of an imagination influenced
by religion. Psychologically considered, therefore,
they are in the last analysis only imperfect reflec-
tions of the idea of another absolutely different
world—a world of the "beyond" parallel to the
world we know here below. From whence, then,
comes this idea, or indeed, even the possibility of
it? Not only does its wide existence present a
serious psychological problem. For such a prob-
lem is even presented by its mere possibility. All
the other ideas and creations of the imagination
representing unreal objects, some of which were
just mentioned, are easy to comprehend in their
psychological possibility, and are even fairly ob-
vious. But on the basis of the world of sense and
phenomena, the possibility of this idea is and re-
mains simply incomprehensible—an absolute riddle.
120
Does this idea perhaps point, then, to a hidden
connection in the depth of the human spirit be-
tween it and the world of the beyond? Does it
perhaps indicate that man is not merely a link in
the world of sense and phenomena, but that he is
at the same time a link in the world beyond? that
he is, at all events, destined and appointed to be
such a link and that he ought to become such? Has
premonition for the world of the beyond perhaps
been put into his soul, that from a vague feeling
it may become more and more clearly and certainly
conscious? In the sense of the exact sciences it is,
of course, here impossible to furnish "proofs."
Wherever matters concerning the higher psychic
life are involved, personal convictions cannot be
completely ehminated in forming a view. It de-
volves upon us, then, to set into clearer relief the
meaning and the practical value of this idea, as
well as its r6le in human psychic life as a whole.
In doing this we shall depart from a point touched
briefly in the chapter on epistemology, presuppos-
ing, however, what was said above about the inde-
pendence of the psychic life and its own inherent
laws.*
As we saw, our very acceptance of anything as
truth is based upon reasoning in a circle. The
hypothesis that human beings are capable of
knowing "truth" underlies all knowledge as an
unproved and unprovable petitio principii. But it
carries with it also the further assumption that
* See pages 75 ff.
121
man's life in the world and, indeed, the world itself
as a whole has some sort of meaning for him. For
otherwise the whole course of the world becomes
for him a mere empty farce—nothing but the de-
ceptive veil of Maya. But only the individual for
himself can arrive at this assumption or conviction.
Considered strictly on its own merits it is absolutely
undemonstrable.
Now religious faith is by far the best and surest
means of giving the individual this conviction.
Religious faith alone is capable of meeting pro-
found doubt as to the meaning of the world and of
life. Only religious faith can erect an insurmount-
able barrier against the fundamentally and con-
sistently pessimistic view that the world and all
human life in it are meaningless.
In our day no one has felt this more strongly or
described it more graphically than Leo Tolstoi.46
He combined an astonishing gift for psychological
introspection with the ability of masterful pre-
sentation. In his "My Confessions" he gives us a
deep insight into the terrible struggles of his com-
pletely distracted soul, and then describes his final
liberation from this agonizing state of mind.
It was just after the completion of his great
novels. He was at the height of his literary fame,
and besides, his circumstances were in every way
comfortable, indeed, happy. Health, a happy
family life and wealth were all his. In spite of this
lif e began to seem flat and empty to him just at this
time. For at this height of success the question of
122
the meaning and purpose of life had to arise in his
mind, and to it he found no answer. He had cast
religious faith aside in his sixteenth year. Even
earlier he did not, as he judged later, have true
faith, but he had trusted in the religious traditions
of his church only under the influence of the au-
thority of his elders. But the superficiality which
he then saw everywhere about him, in the whole
religious life of his environment and in the church,
completely estranged him from religion. Hence,
when later these questions as to the meaning and
purpose of life arose in his mind, his thoughts did
not immediately turn to religion. But the problems
became increasingly insistent. When they began
to dawn upon him he had believed that he would
soon dispose of them, since the answer must be
easy to find. But he began to realize more and
more clearly how terribly mistaken he had been.
Indeed, instead of the answer being easy to find,
the longer and the more seriously he reflected upon
them and the more seriously he studied them, all the
more distressing did these questions become. Over
and over again he tried to solve them by all the
means which human life suggests. But all failed
miserably. Working for his family with all its joys
and cares, which had for years been his whole
thought, failed to satisfy him, for the problem as
to the meaning and the purpose of existence holds
for the family just as much as it does for the in-
dividual. Art, in which he had accomplished so
much, became of no avail, for as a "mirror of life"
123
it only showed him "how desperate his plight was."
Science also failed him, for all that it could offer
merely showed how inadequate it was to furnish a
solution for these problems.
One way of escape, however, still remained open
to him. Just as so many people are not concerned
over these problems, so he might ward them off
by ignoring them. But, as a matter of fact, this
course was no longer possible for him. Having
come to realize the importance of these problems
he could not fall back to an attitude of stupid
indifference. "For what purpose do I live? Why
should I work? Is there in life any purpose which
the inevitable death which awaits me does not undo
and destroy? These questions are the simplest in
the world. Without an answer to them it is im-
possible, as I experienced, for life to go on." * So
for a long time he harbored thoughts of suicide.
But a certain vital instinct, coupled with the hope
of being able to discover a meaning in life, always
restrained him from putting these thoughts into
execution. He took up hard agricultural labor
and found occasion to observe the simple folk who
find happiness and peace in their faith, however
much it may be permeated with superstition. And
then, he too finds a real remedy for his distressed
soul.
"Since mankind has existed, wherever life has
been, there also has been the faith that gave the

from William James' " Varieties of Religious Experience." Tr.
124
possibility of living. Faith is the sense of life,
that sense by virtue of which man does not destroy
himself, but continues to live on. It is the force
whereby we live. If man did not believe that he
must live for something, he would not live at all.
The idea of an infinite God, of the divinity of the
soul, of the union of men's actions with God—
these are ideas elaborated in the infinite secret
depths of human thought. They are the ideas
without which there would be no life, without
which I myself would not exist. I began to see
that I had no right to rely upon my own individual
reasoning and neglect these answers given by
faith, for they are the only answers to the question
of the meaning of life. ..."
"And again there arose in me, with this thought,
glad aspirations toward life. Everything in me
awoke and received meaning. Why do I look fur-
ther? a voice within me asked. He is there, he
without whom one cannot live. To acknowledge
God and live is one and the same thing. God is
what life is. Well, then, live, seek God, for without
him there is no life! . . ."
"After this things cleared up within me and about
me better than ever, and the light has never wholly
died away. I was saved from suicide. Just how
or when the change took place I cannot tell. But
as insensibly and gradually as the force of life had
been annulled within me, and I had reached my
moral death-bed, just as gradually and impercep-
tibly did the energy of life come back."
125
Tolstoi's experience is extraordinarily valuable
because it is based upon the most severe sincerity
with himself. Tolstoi attacked the problems which
life offers—every life and by no means simply his
own—with a strength of purpose unusual for the
general run of mankind. He allowed no subterfuge
to swerve him from his path, and he was never
satisfied with any partial solutions, which, after
all, always leave the main point unanswered. His
only concern was to find an answer to the final
and decisive question—why and to what purpose
is the whole of life?
And is not Tolstoi really right when he suggests
that as long as religious faith is left out of con-
sideration only two possibilities remain, namely:
dull animal existence and suicide? Dull animal
existence may find expression either in a stupid
resignation which gives up asking why or where-
fore, or in a heedless enjoyment of life according to
the principle "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow
we die." Sober-minded people find both alterna-
tives intolerable in the long run, or are thrown
back completely to the level of mere animal exist-
ence. But suicide is simply a mockery of the whole
of life!
Yet this is the inevitable alternative which the
enigma of life presents to man so long as he insists
upon entirely disregarding religion and its belief
in God. Here every one—at least every one who
sees deeply and thinks seriously, must answer yes
or no. There is no middle course. Least of all is
126
any such middle course, or any kind of satisfactory
solution to this problem, provided for in a mere
reference to an actual progress in the history of
mankind, the reference, that is to say, to any sort
of higher development of life. For such talk of
progress and higher development hangs completely
in the air so long as no final aim and goal can be
assigned. For without a goal all bearings are
lacking, indeed, every possibility of their being
such bearings is lacking. For how can progress be
recognized as real progress when we simply do not
know what line of development is in question?
Tolstoi is quite right when he says that the vague
belief in progress is just as foolish, as it would be
for a man driven hither and thither in his skiff by
wind and waves on the ocean to be satisfied with
the answer "I am drifting somewhere" to the ques-
tion, which is for him all-important, "Whither
shall I steer?"
Thus we cannot get away from the fact that only
religious faith in God gives a really satisfactory
answer, because it alone knows a fixed and immu-
table goal, a goal which is not, indeed, inherently
foreign to the human soul, but accords fully with
its deepest and most important faculties and its
most fundamental instincts—its impulse and yearn-
ing for life, its eagerness for a richer and a more
exhalted life. Only living union with God offers
such a goal, only the growing into the perfect life
of the transcendent God can give to these instincts
a hope of enduring satisfaction.
127
However, with all these remarks we have gone
far beyond the original statement of our investiga-
tion. We began with the reflection that all human
knowledge of truth must be based upon the assump-
tion of a final and consistent truth being in some
way or another attainable for man, and also upon
the further assumption that the world and life in
it are not without meaning and aim. But this
assumption, again, only gets a meaning and a con-
sistent form in religious faith. And this practical
importance of faith is by no means restricted to the
fundamental problem and to the domain of the
understanding. It holds just as much for all other
phases of the mental life of man and hence ul-
timately for the whole of human civilization.
Love, vocation, social activity, and, in fact, the
whole of ethical life get their full meaning only
under the point of view of religious faith, and only
thus are they really established. When developed
purely on its own merits ethics lacks the necessary
grounding in the eternal and absolute. Hence the
danger is that it may fall back into the relative,
and therefore into utilitarianism and eudasmonism.
To be sure, moral obligation is absolute in itself
and demands absolute obedience for its own sake.
But, in the first place, this is only a purely formal
characteristic which points as such—as a psycholog-
ical symbol—to the very essence of what is ethical,
but it does not of itself constitute the ethical. On
the other hand, ethics, when brought into connec-
tion with religion, that is to say, when the moral
128
good is made equivalent to the will of God, need
not fear the charge that it thereby looses its au-
tonomy in the sense of Kant. That is to say, such
an ethic need not fear that it has become dependent
upon an external authority, and that it is, therefore,
ultimately founded upon such an external author-
ity. For in the sense of religion—of the Christian
religion at least—the will of God is not an external
authority for man. It certainly is not intended to
be an external authority, since according to its
conviction man is called and fitted for living union
with God, and that means just this: he is fitted and
destined, and therefore also in duty bound, to
grow more and more, and, in the end, to grow com-
pletely into the will of God. For in its highest form
living union is community of will—a unity of will.
The testimony of many others besides Tolstoi
could be cited to prove that the belief in God of
religion can bring complete and enduring satisfac-
tion to the human being, even when he has fallen
into the direst spiritual distress and the most
serious doubts. Only in passing shall I mention
Augustine, who, at the very beginning of the
"Confessions," sums up the result of the expe-
riences and conflicts of his whole life: "O Lord,
thou hast made us for thyself, and our souls are
restless until they find their rest in thee."
But to meet the objection that such testimony
proves little for the modern man because it rests
upon and is determined by the whole mental atti-
tude of this remote period, I shall add the testimony
129
of several recent writers. They are taken from the
collection entitled "The Varieties of Religious
Experience," compiled by the American philos-
opher and psychologist of religion, William James.
I select as the first illustration pages 66 ff.
"I remember the night, and almost the very
spot on the hill-top, where my soul opened out, as
it were, into the Infinite, and there was a rushing
together of two worlds, the inner and the outer.
It was deep calling unto deep—the deep that my
own struggle had opened up within being answered
by the unfathomable deep without, reaching out
beyond the stars. I stood alone with him who had
made me, and all the beauty of the world, and love,
and sorrow, and even temptation. I did not seek
him, but felt the perfect unison of my spirit with
his. The ordinary sense of things around me faded.
For the moment nothing but the ineffable joy and
exaltation remained. It is impossible fully to de-
scribe the experience. It was like the effect of
some great orchestra when all the separate notes
have melted into one swelling harmony that leaves
the listener conscious of nothing save that his soul
is being wafted upward, and almost bursting with
its emotion. The perfect stillness of the night was
thrilled by a more solemn silence. The darkness
held a presence that was all the more felt because
it was not seen. I could not anymore have doubted
that he was there than that I was. Indeed I felt
myself to be, if possible, the less real of the two.
"My highest faith in God and truest idea of him
130
were then born in me. I have stood upon the
Mount of Vision since, and felt the Eternal round
about me. But never since has there come quite
the same stirring of the heart. Then, if ever, I be-
lieve, I stood face to face with God, and I was born
anew of his spirit. There was, as I recall it, no
sudden change of thought or of belief, except that
my early crude conception had, as it were, burst
into flower. There was no destruction of the old,
but a rapid wonderful unfolding. Since that time
no discussion that I have heard of the proofs of
God's existence has been able to shake my faith.
Having once felt the presence of God's spirit, I
have never lost it again for long. My most assur-
ing evidence of his existence is deeply rooted in
that hour of vision, in the memory of that supreme
experience and in the conviction, gained from read-
ing and reflection, that something the same has
come to all who have found God."
Compare with this the account of the crisis of
his life given by the eminent French Protestant,
Adolph Monod, taken by James from Monod's
book, "La Vie," and one of his letters:
"My sadness was without limit, and having
gotten entire possession of me, it filled my life from
the most indifferent external acts to the most se-
cret thoughts, and corrupted at their source my
feelings, my judgments and my happiness. It was
then that I saw that to expect to put a stop to this
disorder by my reason and my will, which were
themselves diseased, would be to act like a blind
131
man who should pretend to correct one of his eyes
by the aid of the other equally blind one. I had
then no recourse save in some influence from with-
out. I remembered the promise of the Holy Ghost;
and what the positive declaration of the Gospel
had never succeeded in bringing home to me, I
learned at last from necessity, and believed, for
the first time in my life, in this promise, in the only
sense in which it answered the need of my soul, in
that, namely: of a real external supernatural ac-
tion, capable of giving me thoughts, and taking
them away from me, and exerted on me by a God
as truly master of my heart as he is of the rest of
nature. Renouncing then all merit, all strength,
abandoning all my personal resources, and ac-
knowledging no other title to his mercy than my
own utter misery, I went home and threw myself
on my knees, and prayed as I never yet prayed in
my life. From this day onward a new interior life
began for me: not that my melancholy had disap-
peared, but it had lost its sting. Hope had entered
into my heart, and once entered on the path, the
God of Jesus Christ, to whom I then had learned
to give myself up, little by little did the rest."
Now the question arises as to whether, on the
basis of our psychological considerations, it is pos-
sible for us to reach a decision as to the idea of God
itself, or, to put it more precisely, concerning our
specific interpretation of this idea. In the discus-
sion of the cosmological and the teleological argu-
ments we had to stop short of such a decision, or,
132
at least, we could only reach it conditionally and
with many critical reservations. There the pan-
theistic form of belief in God which identifies God
with the evolutionary tendency of the cosmos, and
therefore seeks and knows God only in the "All,"
remained possible alongside of the properly the-
istic form as it finds its most perfect expression in
the Christian religion, where the essence of God
is defined as spiritual and ethical.
In taking up this question, now, on the basis of
the psychological results adduced, I need hardly
point out again that obviously here, too, we can-
not speak of real "proof" in the sense of exact
demonstration. Indeed, the question can only be:
What concrete form of the idea of God best corre-
sponds to the active religious motives of the belief
in God.
But, as a matter of fact, the preceding discus-
sion plainly contains certain hints and suggestions
which are all in favor of the theistic and against
the pantheistic conception of God. Only when
the belief in God attains the theistic form can it
really accomplish the task which forms its psycho-
logical significance. The words of Augustine, "our
souls are restless until they find their rest in thee,"
bring the various elements discussed above into a
single thought, and quite plainly demand a theistic
conception of God. Only when the divine being
is of a spiritual and personal nature can the human
soul really "find rest" in him.
The quotations from James show the same thing
133
by a variety of expressions. Even more charac-
teristic and interesting in this respect is the fol-
lowing account, which is also taken from James'
book:
"Between twenty and thirty years I gradually
became more and more agnostic and irreligious,
yet I cannot say that I ever lost that indefinite
consciousness which Herbert Spencer describes so
well, of an absolute reality behind phenomena.
For me this Reality was not the pure Unknowable
of Spencer's philosophy, for although I had ceased
my childish prayers to God, and never prayed to
It in a formal manner, yet my more recent expe-
rience shows me to have been in a relation to It
which practically was the same thing as prayer.
Whenever I had any trouble, especially when I had
conflict with other people, either domestically or
in the way of business, or when I was depressed in
spirits or anxious about affairs, I now recognize
that I used to fall back upon this curious relation
I felt myself to be in to this fundamental cosmical
It. It was on my side, or I was on Its side, how-
ever you may please to term it, in the particular
trouble, and It always strengthened me and seemed
to give me endless vitality to feel Its underlying
and supporting presence. In fact, It was an un-
failing fountain of living justice, truth and strength,
to which I instinctively turned at times of weak-
ness, and It always brought me out. I know now
that it was a personal relation I was in to It,
because of late years the power of communicating
134
with It has left me, and I am conscious of a per-
fectly definite loss." *
In this connection Tolstoi's experience is again
very characteristic and instructive. For a long
time he wavered between the theistic and the pan-
theistic forms of faith, which is quite easy to under-
stand when we remember that the concrete form
which the theistic conception has been given in the
tradition of the orthodox church could not, of
course, satisfy him. Added to this was the fact
that pantheism seemed to him more suitable for
his purpose of striving for religious unity, that is,
of bringing about a universal religion uniting all
peoples. The devil so ensnared him (this is his
own later opinion) that he thought it possible and
especially important in the interests of unison
with the Chinese, Confucianists and Buddhists, as
well as with the philosophically interested atheists
and agnostics, to avoid entirely the "idea of the
Father" in the sense of the New Testament. But
later on, and precisely because of his own religious
experience, he came to realize that such an under-
taking would jeopardize religious purity and depth.
As he himself puts it, he felt that he was suddenly
falling into spiritual decline, that he became inca-
pable of every intellectual joy and energy, without
clearly understanding at first the reason for this.
"Only then did I bethink myself that this was due
to the fact that I had departed from God. And I
began to think, it is strange to say it, I even began
* Op. cit., p. 64 f.
13S
to guess whether there is a God, and a feeling came
over me as though I had found him anew. And I
felt so joyful over this because my conviction in
him was so firmly established, the conviction that
I can and must commune with him and that he hears
me:'*
In fact, it is impossible to have a really personal
religious relationship with an impersonal Absolute.
It is true, of course, that one may gain a personal
relationship even with impersonal objects—with
things, or with abstract ideas and concepts. But
the idea that this can be made the basis of an
attack upon the theistic conception of God is due
to a lack of appreciation of the specific character of
the religious relationship itself. For it is always in
some way a relationship of subordination. Indeed,
according to religious faith, the "other" world or
the world of the "beyond" is absolutely supreme
over the world of sense and phenomena, and the
latter has value only because of its relation to the
former. Therefore, the devout not only desire to
but must subordinate themselves unconditionally
to the "other" world. On the other hand, how-
ever, they are as ethical personalities superior to
everything material and impersonal. Hence there
cannot be a profound and enduring relationship
with an impersonal Absolute, at least not on the
plane of spiritual and ethical religion. But fun-
damentally only religion on this plane, however
often religious practices even within the evangelical
* " Gedanken ttber Gott," XX.
136
church may continue to fall below this high level,
can seriously concern us.
At the same time these reflections lead us to a
wider view, that is, to a view which takes into
consideration also the realm of nature and its
development.
Not to think of the divine being as personal and
spiritual is to subordinate it to the highest level
of the development and unfolding of life already
attained in the world of sense. But this not only
contradicts the fundamental motive of the religious
consciousness but also the teleological conception
of nature. The original reason and the final pur-
pose of the world as a whole would then He in a
form of existence which could be, and already has
been surpassed in this world! And thus, in the
end, we would be pushed back to pure atheism.
As I have already frequently emphasized, theis-
tic belief in God has found its purest expression in
the Christian religion. It is, therefore, absolutely
necessary to turn our attention more explicitly to
the characteristic features of this Christian belief
in God, or, more exactly, to the idea of God which
it involves. That will at the same time furnish
the best refutation of the familiar objections,
which, even in present-day philosophy, are often
raised against it.
The Christian religion is that form or stage of
religious life which, based upon the piety of the
Old Testament, arose under the influence of the
personality of Jesus Christ. If we wanted to
i37
consider the historical process of development for
itself and to describe it in detail, we should, above
all, have to keep in mind the fact that the Jewish
piety of the Old Testament had, even at that time,
been exposed for a considerable period to the in-
fluences of other religions and civilizations, espe-
cially those of Persia and Babylonia, but also those
of Greece, and that these influences continued
during the time in which Christianity itself was
developed. Assuming this to be generally known
and admitted, I shall not go into the particulars of
those influences. For to know what the special
historical factors which concurred to bring about
the establishment of Christianity were does not
matter so much to us as it does to know what the
distinctive fundamental character of Christianity
and of its belief in God is, whatever its historical
origin may have been.
For this purpose we must here call attention to
that element in the history of the development of
Christianity which we have already emphasized:
the Christian religion is that stage of religious
development attained under the influence exerted
by the personality of Jesus Christ. This element
is unquestionably the really decisive factor in the
whole matter. All other elements that may have
come into play, whatever their number, have re-
ceived their characteristic form only through it,
since it has become the fixed point of reference for
all of them, and has served as the foundation upon
which their own trend and purpose have been
138
shaped. At the same time, it was not merely
effective during the period of development, but it
is the element which has remained effective through-
out the whole history of the Christian religion, and
that, too, as the absolutely decisive factor.
For the Christian religion is not simply that stage
of development which arose under the influence of
the personality of Jesus Christ, but it is that stage
which has always continued to be, and is even to-
day, determined by just this influence of the per-
sonality of Jesus Christ. Just as this influence of
the personality of Jesus Christ created the decisive
psychological motive which moved the first Chris-
tians to establish a new religious community, so also
it has continued, and even to the present day still
continues to affect all deeply religious natures,
acting as the decisive psychological motive im-
pelling them to turn to the Christian religion, or
to remain consciously faithful to it.
Indeed, the New Testament is, on the whole,
only the reflection of the impression made by the
personality of Jesus Christ—with various refrac-
tions and radiations of the light to be sure, but,
nevertheless, in the last analysis, a reflection con-
sistent in all its parts and producing a single effect.
In this picture of Jesus as it is drawn in the New
Testament, two traits stand out plainly as the most
characteristic features—and they are the traits
which have always proven to be the strongest
throughout the history of Christianity—the close
personal relationship of Jesus to God, his "Father,"
139
and the thorough-going ethical character of his
conduct and conception of life.
This enables us to understand the fact that the
ethical and personal character of the divine being
constitute the decisive element in that belief in
God conceived under the influence of Jesus Christ.
The God of Christian faith is a spiritual and per-
sonal, more exactly, an ethical and personal God.
Spiritual ethical personal life characterizes the fun-
damental nature of his being.
This serves to give two other essential attributes
of God a more definite form, as well as to establish
their intimate connection in Christian faith,
namely: the transcendence and the immanence of
God in his relation to the world.
For although in almost all other religions, as
well as in most systems of philosophical world-
views, transcendence and immanence are regarded
as mutually exclusive attributes of the being of
God, one of them always being maintained in con-
trast to the other, it constitutes one of the unique
features of the Christian religion that it asserts
equally both the transcendence and the immanence
of God, and that it only admits one of these two
characteristics of the essence of God when it is
limited by the other.
For Christian faith God is, indeed, the absolute
Lord of all reality, and as such an absolutely
transcendent God, exalted above the finiteness,
the transitoriness and the relativity of the whole
sense-world. In this regard the Christian religion
140
consciously and purposely follows what is man-
ifestly the tendency of faith in God even in the Old
Testament. The Lord of the "Kingdom of
Heaven," or of the "Kingdom of God," as the first
Gospel expresses it, must, of course, be an ab-
solutely transcendent God because this "King-
dom of Heaven" is itself absolutely supramun-
dane—completely beyond the world. "My King-
dom is not of this world" says Jesus in the fourth
Gospel, describing his "Father's" kingdom as his
own. Yet, on the other hand, this absolutely
transcendent God has, according to Christian be-
lief, a most vital connection with the world. He
it is who "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on
the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the un-
just" (Matthew V, 45). He feedeth the birds of
the air and careth for the lilies of the field (Mat-
thew VI, 26 ff.). Apart from his will not a sparrow
falls to earth or a hair from our head (Matthew X,
29). Hence, too, when Paul says that all things are
of God he forthwith adds that this God is for us the
goal of the destiny of our life (I Cor. VIII, 6).
And he gives expression to the thought which con-
nects these two ideas when he says that the whole
creation groaneth and hence yearneth after God
(Romans VIII, 22).
Thus, despite his altogether transcendent nature
the God of the Christian religion still pervades the
world as a living God. And this especially holds
with respect to man—collectively, that is to say,
in his whole historical development, as well as in-
141
dividually. "He made of one every nation of men
to dwell on all the face of the earth, having deter-
mined their appointed seasons, and the bounds of
their habitation; that they should seek God, if
haply they might feel after him, and find him,
though he is not far from each one of us: for in him
we live and move and have our being," (Acts XVII,
26 ff .)• Hence the real mission of the Christian reli-
gion is, as is stressed and set forth in detail espe-
cially in the fourth Gospel, to bring mankind, ap-
pointed for God, toward and into life communion
with God.
Consequently there are in all three factors which
together, and only through their intimate connec-
tion, determine the nature of God as conceived
by the Christian religion: the absolute and ethical
personality of God, the absolute transcendence
or sublimity of God and the absolute immanence
or pervasiveness of God. These three factors are
indissolubly connected together. If the purity and
the completeness of the Christian conception of
God are not to be jeopardized, each of these factors
must be fully taken into account.
But in thus reducing the Christian belief in God
to its final elements have we not, at the same time,
criticised and condemned it? Does not this belief
in God necessarily lead to a self-contradictory con-
ception of God? To begin with, are not transcend-
ence and immanence incompatible attributes, and
does not their association show that a conception
of God which seeks to unite them must therefore
142
be logically untenable? In meeting such an ob-
jection it must, above all, be emphasized that faith
as faith can certainly not be disturbed by doubts
of this kind. For faith does not arise from logical
considerations and conceptual determinations, but
from its own consciousness of God. And if in this
consciousness of God elements are found which ap-
pear mutually contradictory to the rational reflec-
tion, it must be remembered that, for the purely
rational conception of the finite and earthly intel-
lect, this consciousness of God is itself simply an
irrational thing. But just as man can, in spite of
this, attain the conviction that a superior reason
is displayed precisely in this irrationality, so he
will also be able, though he cannot completely
solve this apparent self-contradiction on an in-
tellectual basis, to grasp, nevertheless, its cru-
cial import, and thus to find a deeper meaning
in it.
To accomplish this we must realize at the outset
that the three factors characterizing the nature of
God as conceived by Christian faith are really not
of equal importance, but that the first factor, the
ethical personality of God, is predominant over the
other two.
Now what does this characteristic of the ethical
personality of God mean for Christian faith? Again
this must be determined more exactly from Chris-
tian religious conviction and experience. In its
specifically Christian form, religious conviction is
"the believing" as exhibited in the New Testament,
143
that is to say, "the believing" as absolute confi-
dence in the holy and loving will of God.
Now we use the concept "personality" in two
essentially different senses. One of these is purely
or at least predominantly formal. When the con-
cept is applied to God in this sense God is charac-
terized as nothing more nor less than an independ-
ent individual, who is, so to speak, self-existing.
But from the point of view of the Christian belief
in God the factor of the personality of God is barely
touched upon, much less exhausted, in this mean-
ing of the concept "personality." For the chief
concern of the Christian belief in God is not with
any purely formal characteristic, but altogether
with the content of the idea. From the point of
view of faith the conviction that God is a personal
God means that his innermost essence lies in the
line of our own spiritual and ethical personality,
and that faith can vaguely grasp the meaning of
God as personality only through this analogy.
However, we must emphasize the fact that the in-
nermost essence of God lies in the line of our own
spiritual and ethical personal life—in the extension
of this line, of course, but really only in the exten-
sion of just this line. It is, therefore, just in our
ethical life as personalities that we experience God
most surely, most strongly and most immediately—
in the depth of our own soul when we become con-
scious of its ethical nature. But all spiritual per-
sonal life depends upon the definiteness of the will
by which it is regulated. The more unified and
144
constant is this will, the more perfect can the life
as a personality become. Perfect personal life
would be or is attained when the will directing it
can be judged to be absolutely unswerving and, at
the same time, absolutely ethically determined.
Faith in God as living and personal, then, means
being convinced of the absolute continuity and
consistency of his ethical will. Only in a God who
is such a uniform ethical will can we really "be-
lieve," only in such a God can we have real and im-
plicit confidence. For apart from the continuity
of will this confidence would be groundless. And
it would also be groundless if his will did not pos-
sess ethical definiteness, since only the ethical will
can guarantee complete continuity. For every
will is continuous, and therefore worthy of confi-
dence, to the degree in which it is ethical. Thus
the faith of the Christian religion, as implicit con-
fidence in the holy and loving will of God, presup-
poses the unity and the absolute ethical definite-
ness of this will.
Only on the basis of what has just been said can
we get a complete understanding of the other two
factors which, according to Christian faith, are also
decisive in characterizing the nature of God,
namely: the absolute transcendence and the abso-
lute immanence of God in his relations to the
world.
The purport of the idea of immanence for the
Christian belief in God is that the consistent and
ethical fundamental will of God pervades the world
14S
as a living force, and that it determines and guar-
antees a meaning and purpose for the development
of the world.
And the idea of transcendence emphasizes for
the Christian belief in God, above all, that in its
nature and essence God's absolute and ethical lov-
ing will, which rules and pervades the whole world,
lies infinitely beyond all the bustle and stir of the
world of sense and phenomena, so that this phe-
nomenal world cannot have any sort of real or ab-
solute value, except through its relation to this
ethical and loving will of God.
Thus formulated transcendence and immanence
cease to be contradictory attributes of the divine
being, but reveal themselves, on the contrary, as
the mutually supplementary factors for the more
precise conception of the character of God as eth-
ical and living personality. Hence, when these
attributes are given such a meaning in other reli-
gions, and in the systems of philosophical specu-
lation, as to make them mutually exclusive, this
is due to the fact that the ethical and personal char-
acter of the nature of God is not sufficiently em-
phasized, or that its real meaning is not grasped
in these religions and philosophical systems.
But that transcendence and immanence are
really mutually supplementary as elements of
Christian faith is confirmed, indeed, by the fact
that both are already to a certain degree active in
the human soul. For in his own spiritual and eth-
ical personal life man begins to feel the reality and
146
the significance of an "Absolute," of a world of
absolute values which, lies completely beyond the
world of phenomena. Hence, too, the religious and
metaphysical consciousness of man arises most
strongly from his own spiritual and ethical person-
ality. And it is this religious and metaphysical
consciousness which lifts man above the whole
sense-world, and brings him into the world of ab-
solute reality—the world of God and his holy lov-
ing will.
If, now, we undertake to consider as a whole
what we have just discussed severally and specif-
ically, and to bring it into a precise form in accord-
ance with thinking reflection, we can say that the
conception of God corresponding to the Christian
belief in God is that of the unified totality (einheit-
liche Allheit) of spiritual ethical personal life.
To be sure, this concept of unified totality also
seems to involve a self-contradiction. But it does
so in no greater degree for the sphere of the ab-
solute than does the concept of unified diversity
for the domain of the finite. And such unified
diversity is an actual fact.
Modern biology rests absolutely upon the recog-
nition of the fact that all life is ultimately reducible
to the simple cell, and that all higher organisms
are built up from and are composed of aggregates of
such simple cells. Every higher organic being,
including man himself, represents an aggregate
147
composed of an infinite number of most primitive
organisms. Yet the human being is not merely
an aggregate of atoms. No human being can be
identified forthwith with the sum of the individual
cells constituting him a human being. On the con-
trary, the human being, the personality, differs in-
finitely in its nature and importance from the in-
dividual cells. For the personality dominates over
them, often disposes of them at will and remains
unaffected by the fate and by the continual chang-
ing of large quantities of them. There are other
analogous conceptions in biology. I shall only
call attention to one more, which has already been
mentioned incidentally. Not very long ago the
cell was thought to be an absolute unit, that is to
say, an entity not composed of further constituent
elements and simply indivisible. In recent years
biologists have abandoned this view. It has been
found that the individual cell is in its turn a highly
complex phenomenon, and that it is made up of a
countless number of still simpler elements of life.
Thus we have here before us in various nuances,
and others still might be cited, the phenomenon,
or rather the fact that a unity of life exists by virtue
of a multiplicity or community of life, but is by no
means identical with it either in nature or in import
or in meaning. If we pass now, in accordance
with this analogy, from the sphere of sense and
appearance and its relativity to that of absolute
reality, and if, accordingly, we conceive God as
the unified totality of spiritual and ethical personal
148
life, we shall avoid the difficulties of the naive
anthropomorphic conception of God, and shall
still avoid, on the other hand, the ultimate results
of pantheism, however sublime and highly phil-
osophical this may be, which sees the deity simply
in the spiritual life as a whole and completely
identifies God with this spiritual life as a whole.
For when interpreted in accordance with the
analogy referred to, this conception of God is
proof against every pantheistic corruption. It
neither requires the complete merging of every in-
dividual mortal personality into the universal
All, nor does it lead necessarily to an "eternal
restitution," a final and equal salvation for all.
Indeed the contrary seems rather to be suggested
even by the analogy itself, and all the more if we
take into consideration, with reference to the first
point, that the diversity of the various develop-
mental stages of life naturally carries with it
diversity in their relationships among one another.
The most primitive living entities—the cells, may
lose their autonomous character until they appear
only as component parts of a whole, dependent
upon it in the discharge of their functions. Hence,
in higher organisms they no longer truly represent
individual entities as they often really do in lower
organisms. Spiritual personalities, however, can-
not pass over into one another at all, and so they
invariably and necessarily remain real individual
entities.
The final objection might be raised that this
149
analogy must lead us to hold that the conception
of the deity as the all-embracing unification of per-
sonal life could only have arisen from the mul-
tiplicity of creatural life and through its mediation.
But this objection would be entirely unwarranted.
It would only be warranted if the biological con-
ception of development on which it is based were
taken in the special Darwinian sense, that is to say,
in the sense that the development of creatural
life was regarded as taking place naturally and of
itself. But this would not only be a complete
begging of the question, but on purely scientific
grounds this is, as we have seen, a most dubious
hypothesis. There is, then, every reason to believe
that there must be a living power behind the devel-
opment of creatural life, or, differently expressed,
prior to it, determining its purpose and directing
it; and that this power receives into union with
itself those creatural forms of life which attain
spiritual life as personalities, without destroying
their individuality: primordial and all-embracing
unity of spiritual ethical personal life.
If the attempt here made to analyze the Christian
conception of God on the basis of modern thought
be deemed acceptable, it would then follow that
the Christian religion must be considered the truly
absolute religion, not merely in the sense that it
represents the highest form of religious develop-
ment among people upon this earth yet known to
us, nor merely in the sense that this development
will probably never lead to a more perfect form of
150
religion, but more than this, the Christian religion
would then be the highest plane of religious life in an
absolute sense, because it would be the highest plane
of all creatural life. And this would hold no matter
when or where life has originated and developed or
shall originate and develop, no matter on what
other distant heavenly body, whether belonging to
the system of fixed stars bounded by the milky-way,
or to another system beyond.
For accepting the theory of the universe set up
by Copernicus and Newton, we must, it seems to
me, necessarily leave open, theoretically at least,
the possibility that life may not be restricted to the
earth. The taking of this possibility into account
has an appreciable bearing on our final conception
of the absoluteness of the Christian religion.
Against this hypothesis it will not do to insist upon
the limitations of human experience. For it is
precisely when the standpoint of experience is
really seriously maintained that it must be con-
sidered more than probable that life is not confined
to this little world of ours. If this were not true,
how could such a view have seemed so natural and
obvious to a scientist so matter of fact and empirical
as Helmholz,47 to say nothing of the philosophers,
all of whom, since the days of Kant, have taken it
into consideration? Hence it is inadmissible to
urge experience against this view. At best, it could
only be put forth as a postulate of religion or of the
Christian belief in God that life must be restricted
to the earth. But it seems to me that there is little
occasion for such a postulate and that the opposite
hypothesis is the most natural one to make under
the conception of the Christian religion as the
absolute religion.
For then the Christian religion must certainly
be accepted as the absolute religion in the sense
that it represents the highest plane of all religious
life pure and simple, because it represents the
highest conceivable plane of all creatural life.
It is precisely for this reason that the Christian
religion can give a satisfactory answer to the prob-
lem of the meaning of the world and of human life:
the final aim and real purpose of the world is to
develop ethical and spiritual personalities and to
bring them into living communion with God!

1 want expressly to emphasize, once more, that my
discussion of Nietzsche's Mitternachtslied is not in-
tended as an "interpretation." I merely aimed to
bring out the psychological point at which the under-
lying motive of this poem and that of religion are con-
nected. Compare in general Nietzsche's own works.
I have quoted from the complete edition (Naumann,
1899 ff.).

2 Avenarius, R.: Der Kritik der reinen Erfahrung
appeared first in two volumes in 1888-90. It has re-
cently been republished in a second edition by /.
Petzoldt (1907). Avenarius' smaller work: Der men-
schliche Weltbegriff, (1881, new ed., 1905) should also
be mentioned. For writings by his disciples consult
the Vierteljahrsschrift fur wissenschaftliche Philosophie,
and also Petzoldt: Einfiihrung in die Philosophie der
reinen Erfahrung (Vol. I, 1900, Vol. II, 1904).
Of the writings against Avenarius and his school I
would give first place to the work of W. Wundt, pub-
lished as the second part of his voluminous discussion of
naive and critical realism. (See Vol. XIII of his Phil-
osophischen Studien, pp. 1-105 and 323-434.) It has
been republished in his Kleinen Schriften (I, 1910, pp.
259 ff.).
E. Mach, of Vienna, originally a physicist, but now a
philosopher, is in many respects similar to Avenarius,
as well in his general philosophical position as in his
position to belief in God. See especially his: Die Analyse
154
der Empfindungen und Das Verhältnis des Physischen
zum Psychischen (5th ed., 1906).
I have myself, and especially from the point of view
of theology, given a critical discussion of the philosophy
of pure experience, regarding it as similar to the position
of Mach. See Part II of my Theologie und Metaphysik:
Das Verhältnis der Theologie zur modernen Erkennt-
nistheorie und Psychologie, 1901.
3 The interesting discussion of evolution by Kant in
paragraph eighty of the Critique of Judgment (see
J. H. Bernard's translation) has recently been brought
to notice by Haeckel (Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte,
10th ed., pp. 92 f.), and by Liebmann (Zur Analysis der
Wirklichkeit, 3rd ed., pp. 344 f.).
4 In this connection see especially Troeltsch, E.: Das

studien, 1904). Cf. also Menzer, 0.: Kants Lehre

Bauch and Richard Hönigswald should be mentioned
as being discreet and sagacious epistemologists.
9 Of the writings in opposition to Haeckel's " Riddle of
the Universe" that of the church historian Loofs—
Anti-Haeckel (5th ed., Halle, 1906) should be men-
tioned first. Loofs shows the "presumptuous igno-
rance" of Haeckel's discussions of church history.
Other important works in opposition to Haeckel are
the following:
Paulsen, Fr.: Ernst Haeckel als Philosoph, published
in Preussische Jahrbücher (Vol. CI, pp. 29-72), and
also in Philosophia Militans (Berlin, 1901).
Adickes, E.: Kant contra Haeckel (2nd ed., 1906).
Honigswald, R.: Ernst Haeckel, der monistische
Philosoph (1900).
Haeckel's essay: Der Monismus als Band zwischen
Religion und Wissenschaft, and the book mentioned
so often in the text—Die Lebenswunder, are similar to
the Welträtsel. His Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte
(2nd ed., Berlin, 1908), deserves to be taken more
156
seriously. Of the special technical works which form
the basis of his philosophy, the following should be
mentioned:
Generelle Morphologie der Organismen; Anthro-
pogenic oder Entwicklungsgeschichte der Menschen,
and Systematische Phylogenie. In these works Haeckel
is incomparably more cautious and reserved in what he
writes than in his popular works just mentioned. For
example, in the Preface to his Systematische Phylogenie
(p. 6), he writes: "It goes without saying that the his-
tory of our origin is and will remain a building of hy-
potheses, as well as its sister, historical geology. For
it seeks to gain consistent knowledge about the cause
and the march of events which have long since occurred,
the immediate examination of which is therefore an
impossibility. Neither observation nor experiment can
give us direct information about the innumerable
processes of transformation through which the animal
and plant forms known today have issued from their
long line of ancestors. Only a small number of those
changes, which the phylogenetical transformations
have produced, lie before us in a tangible form. By
far the greater number will forever remain hidden from
us."
In general see Georg Wobbermin's booklet: Ernst
Haeckel im Kampf gegen die christliche Weltan-
schauung (Leipzig, 1906). Reprinted in Monismus and
Monotheismus.
The following of the works of Haeckel referred to
by Dr. Wobbermin are in English: Riddle of the
Universe (Harper, 1905). Monism as connecting Reli-
gion and Science (Macmillan). The Wonders of Life
(Harper, 1905). History of Creation (2 Vols., Apple-
ton, 1906). Evolution of Man (2 Vols., Appleton, 1905).
157
The chief representative of the most recent reaction
in natural science caused by the ultraism of Haeckel is
the zoologist, Fleischmann. He has given expression
to this especially in his voluminous Die Deszendenz-
theorie (Leipzig, 1901). Fleischmann says that the
present general supremacy of the concept of evolution
is due solely to man's inclination for fairy stories
(p. 109). The theory of evolution is defective and ob-
jectionable, and anyone who is really working with
good intentions should take no account of it, because
it leads only to nonsense (p. 253). Apart from many
special passages which are worthy of attention, and
which are not void of significance to the general posi-
tion of philosophy, Fleischmann's position is unques-
tionably untenable. The most important and decisive
criticisms of his view are the following: (1) He pays no
attention to the relation in which the theory of descent
stands to the doctrine of evolution as a whole (cosmic
evolution). (2) He misconstrues the fact that the
concept of evolution is a (natural) philosophical idea
by taking it for granted that we are dealing with a
special scientific result. (3) For these reasons the
special arguments which he uses to establish his posi-
tion are insufficient because logically falsely orientated.
The justification of the concept of evolution in itself
(that is, apart from its detailed development) is not
dependent upon whether every single problem will be
solved by its use, but upon whether it makes possible
a complete understanding which would otherwise be
lacking, and upon whether the special problems win
intelligibuity by being classified together. Cf. also,
Fleischmann's Die Darwinische Theorie (1903).
10 Roux is the editor of the Archiv fur Entwicklungs-
mechanik der Organismen. In 1895 he published
158
his Gesammelte Abhandlungen über Entwicklungs-
mechanik der Organismen. Of his other writings the
book especially significant from our point of view is
Der Kampf der Teile im Organismus (Leipzig 1881).
11 Of the numerous works of Weismann the following
are especially worthy of our attention: Uber Leben
und Tod; Zur Frage nach der Unsterblichkeit der
Einzelligen; Das Keimplasma; Die Allmacht der Na-
turzüchtung; Neue Gedanken zur Vererbungsfrage;
Über Germinalselektion; Vorträge zur Deszendenz-
theorie (2 Vols. 2nd ed. 1904). The latter is a sketch of
the Darwinian theory of selection. Weismann's con-
troversy with Herbert Spencer over whether function-
ally acquired variations of structure are hereditary
is well known. Spencer was right in affirming with
certain restrictions what Weismann denied.
The following works of Weismann are in English:
Germplasm (2 Vols., Scribners). Germinal Selection as
the source of definite Variation (Open Court, Chicago).
Essays upon Heredity (2 Vols., Oxford, edited by E.
Poulton).
12 Nagelt: Mechanisch-physiologische Theorie der
Abstammungslehre (Munich and Leipzig).
13 De Vries, H.: Die Mutationslehre (Leipzig, 1901-
03). Arten und Varietäten und ihre Entstehung durch
Mutation. According to De Vries the important devel-
opment from species to species is not accomplished by
variation, that is to say, not by a gradual progressive
development of the smallest variations, but by muta-
tion, that is, by a sudden leap.
The following of the writings of De Vries are in
English: Mutation Theory (2 Vols., Open Court,
Chicago): Species and Varieties, their origin by muta-
tion (Open Court).
159
14 Of Ostwald's numerous publications his Vorlesungen
über Naturphilosophie (3rd ed., 1905) is the most im-
portant. If we would be exact, it should be noted
that Ostwald's whole undertaking can be considered
natural philosophy only in a very restricted sense, for
he intentionally rejects all apriorism.
Ostwald's Natural Philosophy has been translated
(Holt, 1910).
15 Driesch has passed gradually from a mechanical
naturalistic world-view to a most emphatic insistence
upon the uniqueness of the processes of life. He is the
leader of the neo-vitalists. At the same time, he nat-
urally leans toward Aristotelianism. Cf. especially
the following of his works: Die Biologie als selbst-
ständige Grundwissenschaft: Die organischen Regula-
tionen: Naturbegriffe und Natururteile: Der Vitalismus
als Geschichte und als Lehre: Philosophie des Or-
ganischen (2 Vols., 1909).
Driesch's Science and Philosophy of the Organism
is in English (Macmillan). His lectures on Vitalism
are also in English (Macmillan).
16 Reinke: Die Welt als Tat (Berlin, 4Ü1 ed., 1905).
Reinke gives a more technical exposition of his view
in his Einleitung in die theoretische Biologie (Berlin,
1901). See also the article: Die Dominantenlehre in
Natur und Schule (2nd ed., 1903). Reinke's general
philosophical position must be carefully weighed.
Taken as a whole his epistemological position is really
not that of "critical philosophy," and that weakness
often mars his judgment of particular problems. To
this weakness, for example, is due his exceedingly un-
fortunate position toward the account of creation in
Genesis.
17 Harlmann's basic work is Die Philosophie des
160
Unbewussten (2nd ed., 3 Vols., 1904). From our own
point of view the second part of his Religionsphilosophie
is also especially important. It bears the special title:
Die Religion des Geistes (1882). Of his more recent
works the following should be mentioned: Kategorien-
lehre (1896): Geschichte der Metaphysik (2 Vols.,
1899-1900).
Drews, Arthur: has published a good exposition of the
Hartmannian philosophy: E. von Hartmanns philo-
sophisches System im Grundriss (1902). Of Drews'
other works the following deserve special mention:
Die deutsche Spekulation seit Kant, mit besonderer
Rücksicht auf das Wesen des Absoluten and die Per-
sönlichkeit Gottes (1893): Die Religion als Selbst-
bewusstsein Gottes (1906). Drews also wrote the in-
troductory article in the book on monism which he
edited: Der Monismus in Beiträgen seiner Vertreter
(1908). He has recently undertaken, with less success,
to discuss historical subjects. So far as the special
historical discussions are concerned his book entitled:
Die Christusmythe (Jena, 1909, Part H, 1911) is
highly contestible. For a discussion of the chief ques-
tions bearing on the significance of the historicity of
Jesus Christ for the Christian religion, see my Ge-
schichte und Historie in der Religionswissenschaft
(Tübingen, 1911).
The following of the above mentioned works are
in English: Hartmann's Philosophy of the Unconscious
(Paul, Kegan, French, Trubner & Co., London): Drews'
Christ Myth (Open Court, Chicago).

20 In my opinion, Wundt's chief significance as a
philosopher lies in his comprehensive knowledge which
extends into the most varied spheres, and which he is
able to utilize in the discussion of special philosophical
problems. The result is that such problems are dealt
with by him upon the basis of all present-day exper-
imental knowledge. As evidence of this see especially
the methodological part of his Logik (1894-95). Of
course, on the other hand, it is just this characteristic
which constitutes the basis for the limitations that are
contained in his methodology, and which are very
evident, so far as his Logik is concerned, when it is com-
pared with the Logik of Christ. Sigwarts, for example
(2nd ed., 1889-93, Vol. II, Die Methodenlehre. This
book is in English). The same criticism is valid of
Wundt's most recent comprehensive work: Volker-
psychologie. (See especially Vols. 3, 4 and 5 of the 2nd
ed.) For Wundt's metaphysical position see his Sys-
tem der Philosophic (3rd ed., 1903).
The most important of Wundt's disciples is Oswald
Kulpe—see especially his Einleitung in die Philosophie
(3rd ed., 1907). A good resume of the philosophy of
Wundt is that by Edm. K'dnig in Fromann's Sammlung
philosophischer Klassiker (1901). Cf. also Rudolph
Eisler: W. Wundts Philosophie und Psychologie (1902).
Kiilpe's Study of Philosophy is published in English
by Allen, George & Co., London.
21 Fr. Paulsen (died 1908): Kant, der Philosoph des
Protestantismus (1899). Cf. also his exposition of
Kant's philosophy in Frommann's Sammlung philos-
ophischer Klassiker (4th ed., 1903). His Einleitung in
die Philosophie (16th ed., 1906) is especially noteworthy
from our point of view. Cf. also Anm. 9.
162
Paulsen's Introduction to Philosophy (Holt, and also
Paul, Kegan, Trench, Trubner & Co.), and his Kant
(Scribners) are in English.
22 William James (died 1910) is known primarily by
his Principles of Psychology, Varieties of Religious
Experience and Pragmatism. He was a strong advocate
of pragmatism in his last years. Indeed this is fore-
shadowed in his interesting essays: The Will to Believe.
23 Fechner's chief philosophical work is entitled Zend
Avesta (1851, new ed. by Lasswitz, 1901). The best
exposition of Fechner's philosophy is that by Kurd.
Lasswitz in Fromann's Sammlung, 3rd ed., 1910. The
following works of Fechner are important as develop-
ments of the doctrine set forth in Zend Avesta: Das
Bucklein vom Leben nach dem Tode (4Ü1 ed., 1900):
Nanna, oder über das Seelenleben der Pflanzen (edited
by Lasswitz, 1899). Cf. also Wundt's Gustav Theodor
Fechner, Rede zur Feier seines hundertjährigen Geburt-
stages (1901). Also R. Liebe: Fechners Metaphysik
(1903).
Fechner's Little Book of Life after Death has been
twice translated into English (Little, Brown & Co.,
Boston, with an introduction by William James, and
Open Court, Chicago).
24 Eucken has himself published a philosophy of
religion: Der Wahrheitsgehalt der Religion (2nd ed.,
1905). Chief among his other works are the following:
Der Kampf um einen geistigen Lebensinhalt (2nd ed.,
1907): Geistige Strömungen der Gegenwart (4Ü1 ed.,
Grundbegriffe der Gegenwart, 1909). His Lebensan-
schauungen der grossen Denker (6th ed., 1905) should
also be mentioned.
The following of the works of Eucken are in English:
Truth of Religion (Putnam, 1911): Problems of Human
163
Life, as viewed by the great thinkers from Plato to
the present time (Macmillan, 1909): Main Currents of
Modern Thought (1912).
25 Wilhelm Dilthey: (died 1911) unfortunately never
completed his Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften,
the main tendency of which I outlined in the text.
The first volume appeared in 1883. Along with it we
should mention his voluminous discussion: Ideen über
eine beschreibende und zergliedernde Psychologie (in
the Sitzungsberichten der Berliner Akademie der Wis-
senschaften, 1894). The exceedingly noteworthy
sketch, referred to in the text, about the world-views
that are possible today is to be found in the Archiv
für Geschichte der Philosophie (Neue Folge, Vol. IV,
1898, pp. 551 ff.). Cf. also Dilthey's Wesen der Philos-
ophie in Hinneberg's Kultur der Gegenwart (Vol. I,
Pt. IV), and his: Die Typen der Weltanschauung und
ihre Ausbildung in den metaphysischen Systemen, in
the collective work Weltanschauung (Berlin, 1910).
In a somewhat different way Heinrich Richert en-
deavors to reach the same goal as Dilthey. His great
epoch-making work bears the title: Die Grenzen der
naturwissenschaftlichen Begriffsbildung (2nd ed., 1913).
The smaller work: Kulturwissenschaft und Natur-
wissenschaft (2nd ed., 1910), gives a brief and helpful
discussion of the basic thoughts. Cf. also Rickert's
article Geschichtsphilosophie, in the volume published
in memory of Kuno Fischer: Die Philosophie im Beginn
des 20 Jahrhunderts (2nd ed., 1907). Since 1910 Georg
Mehlis has been publishing in Tübingen an interna-
tional magazine for the philosophy of culture under the
title "Logos," in which some valuable articles by
Rickert have appeared. For the significance of the
position of Rickert to theological and religio-philosoph-
164
ical work, see my discussion in Geschichte und Historie
in der Religionswissenschaft (Tubingen, 1911). Cf. also
Fr. Traub, Theologie und Philosophic, pp. 93 ff.
Windelband, Praludien (3rd ed., 1907).
26 Herbert Spencer's System of Synthetic Philosophy
(1862 ff.) contains in volume I, First Principles, the
fundamental principles of the whole system, and in the
other nine volumes the application of these prinicples
to the disciplines Biology (new revised and enlarged
edition 1898-99), Psychology, Sociology and Ethics.
Spencer makes the theory of evolution into a philos-
ophy, and develops the concept of evolution in every
sphere of human knowledge. (See Gaup: Herbert
Spencer Fromann's, 2nd ed., 1900.) That Spencer is
thereby led into arbitrariness and dilettantism cannot
be denied.
27 See Kant's formulation of this thought in Religion
innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft, 2nd ed.,
p. 16.
28 See Kant's posthumous writings, published by
Rudolph Reicke (Altpreussischen Monatsschrift, Vols.
XrX and XX). Cf. also Heman in Kantstudien (1904,
pp. 155 ff.).
29 The history of the discovery of Neptune, that is to
say, the history of the prognostication of its existence,
and of the approximated precomputation of its course
(the course of a planet hypothetically disclosed!) on
the basis of the variations in the course of Uranus,
along with the discovery of the planet later by Galle, is
not only highly interesting in itself, but is also of su-
preme importance to every complete epistemological
and metaphysical view. A purely positivistic epistemol-
ogy, that is, an epistemology which claims that expe-
rience is the only source of knowledge, is contradicted
165
by such a fact as the discovery of Neptune. W. Meyer
has given a detailed account of the discovery (Viertel-
jahrsschrif t der Züricher naturforschenden Gesellschaft,
1874, pp. 226 ff.).
30 Du Bois Reymond: Über die Grenzen des Natur-
erkennens (8th ed., 1898, p. 17). The further develop-
ment following the statement given in the text shows
that the criticism there given is not unjust. Moreover
a further epistemological error, worse than the one
pointed out, is to be seen. For he makes the supposi-
tion that the "Laplacian Spirit" is not limited to nat-
ural occurrence in its ability to foretell events, but is
able to foretell what will happen in the future of the
race. Thus the human will is treated as if it were a
physical atom.
31 To supplement the very brief sketch of the posi-
tions of Hartmann, Drews, Spencer and Wundt which
was given in the text, the following references to espe-
cially instructive resumes of their philosophy by each
of these writers should be given: Hartmann, Die Reli-
gion des Geistes, pp. 155 ff. Cf. Anm. 17. Drews, Die
deutsche Spekulation seit Kant, Vol. I, pp. 65 f., cf. also,
Das Ich als Grundproblem der Metaphysik, pp. 279 ff.,
and Die Religion als Selbstbewusstsein Gottes, pp.
282 ff.: Spencer, First Principles, concluding section of
the book, reprinted as especially characterizing his
position by Spencer himself in Principles of Biology
(concluding section): Wundt, System der Philosophie,
2nd ed., pp. 666 ff.
32 H. Lotze's well known article: Leben und Lebens-
kraft in Wagner's Handwörterbuch der Physiologie
(B raumschweig, 1842).
33 Oscar Hertwig's Zeit- und Streitfragen der Biol-
ogie, having been written for the general public, is
166
especially deserving of recommendation. For the ques-
tion dealt with in the text the work entitled Mechanik
und Biologie (1897) is important. See also his address:
Die Lehre vom Organismus und ihre Beziehung zur
Sozialwissenschaft (1899). The text-book: Die Zelle
und die Gewebe (1893-98) is strictly technical. In
Vol. II, Ch. V, he gives a thorough discussion of the
difference between the mechanical and the organic.
This book is in English (Allen, George & Co., London).
34 H. Driesch: Philosophic des Organischen, Vol. II,
PP. 135 f.
30 Kupffer gives the criticism of the text in his address
at the opening of the tenth convocation of the An-
atomische Gesellschaft (Erganzungsheft zum XII
Band des Anatomischen Anzeigers, 1896). The inves-
tigations in question were conducted by Herbst, to
whom we also owe the discovery that the eyes of crabs
can only be regenerated when the ganglia opticum re-
mains unimpaired. Similar investigations were made
by H. Przibram in 1900 at the zoological station in
Naples. Among the results of these the following is
especially interesting from our point of view, not only
because it warns us against what was mentioned in the
text, but also because, by reason of its greater com-
plexity, it warns us against a premature acceptance
of "dysteleology." In species of alpheus which lose
the large "snapping claw," a small "pinching claw"
afterwards grows in its place, while the pinching claw
which has not been destroyed develops, by means of
various changes in size and form of the skin, into a
snapping claw. See Przibram's proof in Vol. XX,p. 526,
of the Biologischen Zentralblatt. Further testimony
is to be found in the works of Driesch (see Anm. 15,
but more especially Die Organischen Regulationen,
167
1901, and Philosophic des Organischen, Vol. I,
1909).
36 Natiirliche Schopfungsgeschichte, 10th ed., p. 775.
When Haeckel here refers to Helmholz—"as this,
for example, has been proven, so far as the human eye
is concerned, by Helmholz, one of the most careful in-
vestigators of the eye"—he is thinking of Helmholz'
discussion in the Handbuch der Physiologischen Optik,
where he refers, despite his admiration of the wonderful
arrangement of the human eye, to the fact that im-
perfections are to be found in it. However, so far as
the bearing of this fact upon our own and Haeckel's
philosophical formulation of the question is concerned,
the following sentence from Helmholz, which is the
most significant one of all, shows with the utmost de-
sirable clearness. "The apparent monochromatical
divergencies in the eye are not, as the spherical aberra-
tions of glass lenses, symmetrical around an axis, but,
on the contrary, they are unsymmetrical and of such
a kind as are not to be found in well made optical in-
struments" (2nd ed., p. 170). The words I have ital-
icised show very plainly the point of view which, in a
subjective and sub-conscious way, dominates Helm-
holz' whole conception.
37 K. E. von Boer (died 1876), excepting Darwin, did
more than anyone else to give a scientific establishment
to the doctrine of evolution—a doctrine which he even
advocated before 1859, that is to say, before the appear-
ance of Darwin's Origin of the Species. Von Baer was
foremost among the natural scientists and philosophers
exercising a great influence upon Herbert Spencer.
For the Baerian thesis, that the evolution of every
living being consists in an advance from a similarity
of structure to a dissimilarity of structure, was extended
168
and enlarged by Spencer into a general law of evolution,
namely, that all evolution consists of a process of grad-
ual dissipation and concomitant integration (see First
Principles, p. 470). The work of von Baer which is of
general philosophical interest bears the title Reden und
kleinere Aufsatze and is in two volumes. For his con-
ception of a directedness toward an end, see his treatise:
Uber Zweckmassigkeit oder Zielstrebigkeit uberhaupt,
and also, Uber Zielstrebigkeit in den organischen
Korpern insbesondere {op. cit., Vol. II, pp. 51 ff. and
173 ff.). The catholic philosopher, R. Stolzle, has given
a complete and useful exposition of the Baerian world-
view: K. E. v. Baer und seine Weltanschauung (1897).
P. N. Cossmann's book: Elemente der empirischen
Teleologie (1899) has the merit of pointing out the ex-
tent to which recent science, even though often un-
willingly and contrary to its desire in the matter, works
with teleological principles.
^Reinke expresses this view under the concept
"dominanten." Dominanten are for him the funda-
mental forces which guide evolution. They are to be
presupposed for the most varied spheres of organic life.
It should not be overlooked that this theory of Reinke
assists in the obliteration of the boundaries between
natural scientific investigation and philosophical re-
flection. It can claim no further credit than that of
having brought to expression the need of an enlarge-
ment of the causal and mechanistic by a teleological
view.
39 In his address before the Akademie der Wissen-
schaften, of Berlin, entitled "The Epistle of Ptolmey to
Flora," Harnack has brought out the fact that, even
in early Christianity, attempts were not lacking at
bringing the basic thoughts of the Christian religion
169
under a kind of evolutionary idea. (Sitzungsberichte
der Berliner Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1902, pp.
522 ff.).
40 Whereas, for example, so far as the animal king-
dom is concerned, the standard classification of the
first half of the 19th century was that of George Cuvier,
in which four great branches (vertebrates, articulates,
mollusks and radiates) were differentiated, the clas-
sifications of zoologists today vary from seven (R.
Hertwig) to seventeen (Fleischmann) divisions.
41 The famous archaeopteryx lithographica, found in
the slates of Solenhofen, certainly cannot be considered
a special intermediary form between birds and reptiles.
But it does show the hypothetical character and the
insufficiency of our idea of classes. See Fleischmann
{op. cit. Ch. VI).
42 A discovery made in 1891 in Java by a Dutch army
surgeon, Eugene Dubois, has been put forth with de-
cided positiveness by Haeckel and his friends as a
fossil of a "true monkey-man" (Pilhecantropus
erectus). From Haeckel's account in the Natiirliche
Schopfungsgeschichte the laity would scarcely under-
stand that this discovery consisted only of a skull, two
molar teeth and a thigh bone! And it should be added
that it has never been proven that these pieces all be-
long to a single individual. Haeckel's concluding ver-
dict is so characteristic of his way of dealing with such
matters that I cannot refrain from quoting it here.
"This genuine monkey-man stands so nearly between
the known man-like apes and the lower races of man
that in 1895, at the International Zoological Congress,
at Leyden, a very spirited debate as to its meaning took
place. About a dozen leading authorities expressed
their opinion on the subject. Three declared that the
170
thigh-bone and the skull of this great anthropoid be-
longed to a monkey, three others held that they be-
longed to a human being, and six or more other zool-
ogists declared the animal to be what it redly is according
to the laws of logic{!) namely: a true transitional form be-
tween man and monkey—the much sought "missing
link" of the line of our ancestors. {Op. cit. 1902,
pp. 715 f.). Today prominent zoologists, for example,
Hermann Klaatsch, declare that Dubois' discovery
is not justly entitled to the name Pithecantropus erectus.
They say that erectus is a misnomer because, in all
probability, the animal did not have an erect posture.
For the same reason, and also upon other grounds,
the name Pithecantropus is also false. In all probability,
so these authorities hold, this animal is a species of
Anthropopithecus, and is a man-like ape.
On the other hand, the meaning of the so-called
Neanderthal skull and the other fossils found with it,
has recently been more strongly emphasized and more
highly valued than hitherto. These bones were found
in 1859 in the valley of Neander near Duesseldorf.
The skull is of a man, is very flat on top and has a very
thick bone-friz above the eye-holes. Virchow regards
this as a pathological skull formation. But this is not
the only other important discovery. Many others have
been made. For example, to mention only the most
significant, that made in Belgium in the cave of Spy,
and especially the one made in Croatia, near Crapina,
where a whole mound of bones, with pieces of no less
than ten individuals representing different periods,
has been discovered. The more recent discoveries of
Moustier and La Chapelle-aux-Saints (both made in
1908) belong to the Neanderthal type. All of these
discoveries show a type of man which really varies from
171
the average type of today. Yet they remain within
the general type "man," and more than likely, they
simply are evidence of an older race of men having
existed.
It appears to be somewhat different with the third
most recent discovery, that by the Heidelberg wall.
Here, in October, 1907, there was unearthed a lower
jaw-bone with some teeth intact, the characteristics of
which, according to specialists, refer to a type that is
older than the Neanderthal type. Indeed some in-
vestigators (especially Otto Schoetensack and Herr-
mann Klaatsch) think that they can see in this "homo
Heidelbergmsis" the universal root form from which,
on the one hand, man, and on the other hand, the
man-like apes, have developed. Cf. O. Schoeten-
sack: Der Unterkiefer des "Homo-Heidelbergensis,"
(1909).
In conclusion, and this is the important point for us
here, the Christian belief in God has absolutely no
interest in the question of the direct origin of the
human race, and the answering of this question in the
strictest sense of the Darwinian theory would not in
the least affect this belief.
43 For a criticism of "biogenetic basic laws" see Ch.
XIV of Fleischmann's Die Ausnahmen des biogen-
etischen Grundgesetzes. But Fleischmann's criticism
is very unfortunate in this connection because it is so
exaggerated. Prudent and sober-minded specialists
take the position given in the text. For example, see
Oscar Hertwig: Die Zelle und die Gewebe (1898,
Bk. II, pp. 273 ff., translated).
44 The technical expressions of the text refer to the
most important elements and stages of embryonic
development, according to the view considered valid
172
today. Concerning this see the text-books of physiol-
ogy, or H. Driesch: Philosophic des Organischen, Vol. I,
PP. 33 f.
45 The chief critics of Darwinism among natural
scientists are: Wigand, Der Darwinismus und die
Naturforschung Newtons und Cuviers (3 Vols. 1874-
77); Gusiav Wolff, in Biologischen Zentralblatt, Vols. X
and XIV. More exact information concerning the
history of recent natural science in its relation to Dar-
winism is to be found in Rudolph Otto's admirable book:
Naturalistische und religiose Weltansicht (2nd ed.,
1909). I should also mention especially Gust. Portig's
large two volume work: Das Weltgesetz des kleinsten
Kraftaufwandes in den Reichen der Natur (1903-04).
Beneath his fantastic speculations there lies buried a
genuine bit of knowledge and a kernel of profound
truth. See also K. Beth: Die Entwicklungsgedanke und
das Christentum.
46 For the development of the religious life of Tolstoi
the following works are of special importance: My Con-
fession (1879), My Belief (1884), What, then shall we
do? (1885). His "Life" is more systematic (1889).
The illustrated cabinet edition is the best English
edition of the works of Tolstoi (Estes). Of the liter-
ature about Tolstoi the work by Fr. Rittelmeyer: Tol-
stois religiose Botschaft (1905) should be mentioned.
47 Helmholz has put forth the idea that the origin of
life on the earth is perhaps to be explained by a trans-
ference of germs of life to the earth from other heavenly
bodies. He has not failed to recognize the purely
hypothetical character of this supposition, and he has
advanced it with extreme reserve. On the other hand,
he simply implicitly presupposes the existence of crea-
tural life on other planets. The discussion in question
173
is as interesting as it is noteworthy. (See his Vorträge
und Reden, Vol. II, pp. 346 ff.
