 PREFACE. 
 
 %3» 
 
 IF ever the story of any private man's ad- 
 ventures in the world were worth making 
 public, and were acceptable when published, 
 the Editor of this account thinks this will 
 be so. 
 
 The wonders of this man's life exceed all 
 that (he thinks) is to be found extant ; the 
 life of one man being scarce capable of a 
 greater variety. 
 
 The story is told with modesty, with seri- 
 ousness, and with a religious application of 
 events, to the uses to which wise men always 
 apply them, viz. to the instruction of others 
 by this example, and to justify and honour 
 the wisdom of Providence in all tl variety 
 of our circumstances, let them happ » how 
 
 the}' will,

 The Editor believes this narrative to be a 
 just history of fact; neither is there any ap- 
 pearance of fiction in it; and though he is 
 well aware there are many who, on account 
 of the very singular preservations the Author 
 met with, will give it the name of romance; 
 yet, in which ever of these lights it shall be 
 viewed, he imagines, that the improvement 
 of it, as well as the diversion, as to the in- 
 struction of the reader, will be the same * 
 and as suck, he thinks, without farther 
 compliment to the world, he does them a 
 great service in the publication. 
 
 
 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 
 
 OF 
 
 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 
 
 I was born at York, in the year 1632, of A reputable fa- 
 mily. My father was a native of Bremen, wha by mer- 
 chandizing at Hull for fome time, gained a very plentiful 
 fortune. He married my mother at York, who received 
 her firft breath in that country; and as her maiden name 
 was Robinfon, 1 was called Rohinfon Kreutzxatr; which not 
 being eafily pronounced ia the Englith tongue, we arc 
 commonly known by the name of Crufoe. 
 
 1 was the youngeft of three brothers. The eldeft was a 
 lieutenant-colonel in Lockhart's regiment, but -{lain 6y the 
 Spaniards : what became of the other I could never learn. 
 
 No charge or pains were wanting in my education.-— 
 My father defigned me for the law, yet nothing would 
 ferve me but I muft go to fea, both againft the will of my 
 father, the tears of my mother, and the entreaties of friends. 
 One morning my father expoftulated very warmly with me: 
 What reafon, fays he r have you to leave your native coun- 
 try, where there muft be a more certain profpeft of con- 
 tent and happinefs, to enter into a wandering condition of 
 uneafinefs and uncertainty ? He recommended to me 
 Augur's wiih, u Neither to defire poverty nor riches i** 
 that a middle ftate of life was the nioft happy, and that 
 the high towering thoughts of railing our condition by wan- 
 dering abroad, were furrounded with nfifery aud danger, 
 and often ended with confufion and difappointment. I 
 entreat ^ou, nay, I command you, (fays he,) to defift from 
 thefe intentions. Gonfider your elder brother, who laid 
 down his life for his honour, or rather loft it for his difobe- 
 dience to my will. If you will go, (added he,) my prayers 
 fhall however be offered for your prefervation ; but a time 
 may come, when defolate, oppreiled, or forfaken, you 
 
 A3 
 
 
 may wifh you had taken your poor defpifed father's counfel. 
 He pronounced thefe words wiih fuch a moving and pater- 
 nal eloquence, while floods of (ears ran down his aged cheeks, 
 that k feemed to ftem the torrent of my refolutions. But 
 this feovwore off, and a little after [ informed my mo;her, 
 that 1 could not fettie to any bufinefs, my refolutions were 
 fo flrong to fee the world; a^d begged llie would gain my 
 father's confent only to go one voyagel which if it did n~t 
 prove profperous, I would never attempt a fecond. But my 
 defire was as vain as my fo'ly in afking. My mother paf- 
 iionately ex'preffed h?r diflikc-of this propifal, telling me 
 §t That. a? (he faw I was beVt upon my own deftruclion. con- 
 *' trary to their will and my duty, (he w uld fay no more, 
 " but leave me to my fid f io do wha f ever I pleafed. '*' 
 
 1 was then, I think, nineteen years old, when one time be- - 
 ing at [{a!j, [ met a fchookfellaw of mine going along wi h 
 his father, who *as mailer of a fhip, to London ; and ac- 
 quainting him with my wandering dciir. s, he aflured me of 
 a frzs ps/Tag^ and a plentiful (hare of what was neceffkry. 
 Tlujs, without imploring a blefTing, or taki-g farewell of my 
 parents, I took Shipping on the firll of vSeptember, ! 6.5 I . We 
 iet (ail icon after, and our (h»p had fcarce left the Humber 
 a- (fern, when there arofe (o violent a dorm, that being ex- 
 tremely fea-(ick, J concluded the judgment cf God defcrv* 
 e,dly followed me for my d.fobedience to, my dear parents, 
 it was then I called to mind the good advice of my father.; 
 how eafy and comfortable was a middle flaie of life ; and 
 
 I firmly refolved, if it pleafed God to fet me on dry land 
 Offce more, I would return to my parents implore their fcr- 
 givenefs, and bd a final adieu to my wandering inclinations. 
 
 Such were my thoughts while the ftorm, continu d ; but 
 ^thefe good rcfoluions decreafed with the danger ; more 
 **efpecially when my companion came to me, clapping me on 
 the moulder : " What, -Bob!" faid he, "fureyou was not 
 ** frightened laft night with fcarce a capful of wind ?"— 
 ** And do you,'' cried I, " call fuch a violent ftorm a capful 
 *' of wind? 1 ' " A ftorm, you fool you \ yi faid he, f x this is no- 
 "thing: a good (hip and fea-ioom always baffles fuch a 
 *< fcbblfa f quail of wind as that: But you're a frefh- water 
 " failor : Come boy, turn out, fee what fine weather we have 
 ! now, and a good bowl of punch will drown all your paft. 
 
 II for rows." In fhort, the punch was made, I was drunk, and 
 in one night's time drowned both my repentance and my 
 
 
 good refolutions, forgetting entirely the vows and promifes 
 I made in my diftrefs : and whenever any reflections would 
 return on me, what by company, and what by drinking, I 
 foon rnafjered thofe firs, as 1 deridingly called them. But 
 this only made way , for another *rial, whereby f could not 
 but fee how much I was beholden to kind Providence. 
 
 Upon the fixth clay we came to an anchor in Harwich 
 road, where we lay wind-bound with fome Ntwcaftlefhips; 
 and there beirg good anchorage,. and our cables found, ths 
 feamen forgot thair late toil and danger, and fpent the time 
 as merry as if tbey had been on (bore. But on the eighth day 
 thfre arofe a &riik gale cf wind, which prevented our cid'ng 
 it up the river; and ftill increafmg, cur (hip rode forei:aflle 
 in, and iliipped feveral large feas. 
 
 It was net long before horror feiz?d the .feamen them- 
 felves, and I heard the mailer exprefo this melancholy 
 ejaculation, "Lord have mercy upon us, we mail be ail loft 
 and undone!* 4 For my part, fiek unto death, I kept my cabin, 
 till the univerfal and terribly dreadful apprehenftons of our 
 fpeedy fate made his gec upon deck; and there I was af- 
 frighted indeed. The fea went mountains high; I could 
 fee nothing but diftrefs around us ; two 'fhi-ps had cut their 
 mads en beard, and another was foundered ; two more that 
 had loft their anchors, were forced cut to the mercy of the 
 ocean: and to fave tur lives we were forced to cut our 
 fore mail and mainmad quite away* 
 
 Who is there fo ignorant as not to judge of my dreadful 
 condition? I was but a -. firefh -waer faibr, and Iherefore i; 
 fee.T.ed more terrible. Our (hip .was "very good, but over- 
 loaded ; which made the Tailors often cry ouv, '•« She would 
 iC founder i * Words I then was Ignorant of. All this while 
 the norm continuing, and rather increafirg, the rnafter and 
 the moft lbber part of his men went to prayers, expecting 
 death every moraer t. In the middle of the night one cried 
 ' out,,* 'We had fprung a ie;k ! M another, ** Thai there were * 
 ** f>ur reet water in the -hoid V* I was juft ready to expire 
 w.'th fear, when immediately all hands were called to the 
 pump; and the. men forced me alfo in that extremity to 
 ibare with them ia their' labour. While thus employed, the 
 matter efpying (ome light colliers, fi'ed a gun as a figrial of 
 diftrefs ; and i, rot uncerftanding what it meant, and think* 
 ing that either the fhip broke, or fome dreadful thing hap- 
 pened, fell into afapbon. Even hi that common condition 
 
 
 t 
 
 of wee, nobody minded me, excepting to thruft me afide 
 with their feet, thinking me dead, and it vas a great while 
 before I recovered. 
 
 Happy it was for us, when upon the fignal given, they 
 ventured out their boats to fave our lives* All our pumping 
 had been in van, and vain had all our attempts been, had they 
 not come to our (hip's fide, and our men caft them a rope over 
 the Hern wi h a buoy to it, wh : ch after great labour they got 
 hold of, and we hauling them up to us, got into their boat, 
 and left our (hip, which we perceived fink wichin lefs than a 
 quarter of an hour ; and thus I learned what was meant by 
 foundering at fea, And now the men inceflantly laboured to 
 recover their own ftup ; but the fea ran fa high, and the wind 
 blew fo hard, that they thought it convenient to hale within 
 ihore; which, with. great difficulty and danger, at laft we 
 happily effe&ed, landing at a place called Cromer, no tTfar 
 from Wintertcn light-houfe; from whence we all walked to 
 Yarmouth* where as objects of pity, many good people fur- 
 Eifhed us with ncctflaries to ca-ry us either to Hull or London. 
 
 Strange, after all this, like tne prodigal (on, I did not re- 
 turn to my father; who hearing of the (hip's calamity, for a 
 long time thought me entombed in the deep. No doubt 
 but I mould have Jhared on his fatted calf, as the Scripture 
 expreffeth it ; but my ill fate ftill pulhed me on, in fpite of 
 the powerful coovi&ions of reafon and confeience. 
 
 When we had been at Yarmouth three days, I met my 
 old companion, who had given me the invitation to go on 
 board along with his fatner. His behaviour and fpeech 
 were altered, and in a mrlancholy manner afked me how I 
 did, teJling his father who I was, and how 1 had made thig 
 voyage, only for a trial to proceed further abroad. Upon 
 wh'ch' the old gentleman turning to me gravely, faid, 
 49 Young man, you ought never to go to fea any more, but to 
 "take this for a certain flgn that you never will profper in 
 "afcafaring condition." •'Sir/' anfwered I, "will you 
 u take the fame refolution }" 9i It is a different cafe," faid 
 he; "it is my calling, and confequenily my duty ; but as 
 94 you have made this voyage for a trial, you fee what ill 
 4< fuccefs Heaven has fet before your eyes ; and perhaps 
 "our mifcries have been on your account, like Jonah in the 
 "(h'pof Tar/kifo. But pray what are you ? and on what 
 "account did you go to fea '?*' Upon which 1 very freely 
 dcclajed my whole ltory ; at the end cf which he made this 1 
 
 
 exclamation, u Yea fecred Powers, what had I committed, 
 " th^t fuch a wretch mould enter into my (hip to heap •;: on 
 ,( mc fuch a deluge of mrferies!" But foon recolledbng 
 his patfion, u Young man," faid he, "if you do not go back, 
 "depend upon it, wherever you go, ycu will meet with 
 ".difaiters and difappoimments tilt your father's words are 
 €( fulfilled upon you" And fo we parted, 
 
 I thought at jSrft to return home; but flume oppofed that 
 good motion, as thinking I fhould he laughed at by my neigh- 
 bours and acquaintance. So ftrangc is the nature of youth, 
 who are not aihamei to fin, but yet afhamed to repent; and 
 fo far, from being afhamed cf thofe actions for which they 
 may be accounted fools, they think it folly to return to their 
 duty, which is the principal mark of wiidom. In fhort, I 
 travelled up to London, refolving upon a voyage ; and a 
 voyage I foon heard of, by, my acquaintance with a captain 
 who took a fancy to me, to go to thecoaft cf Guinea. Hav- 
 ing fome money, and appearing like a gentleman, 1 went 
 on board, not as a common failor or foremail man ; nay, 
 the commander agreed I fhoqld go that voyage with him 
 without any expenfe ; that I fhould be his mefsmate and 
 companion, and J was very welcome to carry any thing 
 with me, and. make, the brfl merchar.dife I could. 
 
 I bleffed my happy fortune, atd humbly thanked my cap- 
 tain for this offer ; and acquainting my friends in Yorkfhtre, 
 forty pounds were fent me, the greateft part of which my 
 dear father and mother contributed to, with which I bcught 
 toys and trifles, as the captain directed me. My captain 
 alio taught me navigation, how to keep an account of the 
 (hip's courfe, take anobfervation, and led me into the know- 
 ledge of feveral ufeful brarxhes of the mathematics. And 
 indeed this voyage made me both a failor and a merchant; 
 for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold dufl for 
 my adventure, which produced at my return to London, 
 almoft three hundred pounds. But in this voyage I was ex- 
 tremely fick, being thrown into a violent calenture through 
 the exceffive heat, trading upon the coaft from the latitude 
 of fifteen degrees north, even to the line itfelf. 
 
 But alas ! my dear friend, the captain, foon departed this 
 life after his arrival. This was a fenfible grief tome: yet 
 I refolved to go another voyage with his mate, who had 
 now got command of the fhip. This proved a very unfuc- 
 cessful one; for though I did not carry quite a hundred 
 
 A * 
 
 
 pounds of my late acquired wealth, (fo that I had two hun* 
 dred pounds left, which I repofed with the Captain's widow, 
 who was an hsneft gentlewoman,) yet my misfortunes in 
 this unhappy voyage were very greah For our fliip failing 
 towards the Canary iflands, we were chafed by a Salee 
 rover ; and in fpiie of all the hafte we could make, by crowd- 
 ing as much canvas as our yards could fpread, or our mads 
 carry, the pirate gained upon us, fo that we prepared our- 
 felves to. fight. They had eighteen, guns, and we had but 
 twelve. About three in the afternoon there was a defperate 
 engagement, wherein many were killed and wounded on 
 both fides; but Ending ourfelves overpowered with num- 
 bers, our (hip difabled, and ourfelves toj impotent to have 
 the lead hopjs of fuccefs, we were forced to (urrender; ard 
 accordingly were all carried prifoners into the port of Salee. 
 Our men were fent to the Emperor's court to be fold there ; 
 b/jt the pirate capa : n takirg notice of me, kept me to be 
 his own nave. 
 
 In this condition, I thought myfelf the moft miferable 
 creature on earth, ard the prophecy of my father came afrefti 
 into my thoughts. However* my condition was better than 
 I thought it io^e, as will foon ap: ear. Some hopes indeed 
 I had that my new patron would go to fea again, whe:e he 
 might be taken by a Span;fn or P^rtuguefe man of war, and 
 then I fliould be fet at liberty. But in this I was m flaken ; 
 tor he never took me wif.h him, but left me to look after his 
 little garden, and do the drudgery of his houfe ; and when he 
 .returned from f e , would miike me Jie in he cabin, and 
 look after the (hip. I had no one that I could communicate 
 my thoughts to, which were continually meditatirg my 
 efcape ; no frrgnihman, Iriihrmn, or Scotchman here* but 
 myfelf; and for two years I could fee nothing practicable, 
 but enly pleafed myfclf with the imagination. 
 
 After fome leng h of timr, my patron, a* 1 found, grew fo 
 poor that he could not fit out his (hip as ofual ; and then he 
 ufed ccnfbamiy, once or twice a week, if the weather was 
 fair, to go Oct a fifhing, tak'ng me and a young Morefco boy 
 to rv w the boat ; and fo much pleafed was he u»i h n e for 
 my dex'eri'y in catching the fifli, that he would often feud 
 me with a Moor, who was one of his k info en, and the Mo- 
 refco ycutb, to catch a difii of- nth for him> 
 
 One morning, as we *Vere at the fp07t> there arofe fuch 
 a-thicl; fog, th;t we left fight cf the &o:rj and rowing we 
 
 
 knew not which way, we laboured all the night, and in the 
 morning found ourfeives in the ocean, two leagues from 
 land, However, we attained there at "engirt,' and made the 
 greater haile, brcaufe our ftomachs *ere exceedingly fjfctarp 
 and hungry. In order to prevent fuch difaiteri for the 
 future, my patron ordered a carpenter to build a little ffajfe- 
 room or cabin in the middle of the lon^-boac, with a place 
 behind it to fleer and hale home the main (beet, with other 
 conveniences to keep in from the weather ; as alfo lockers 10 
 put in ail manner of provifions, with a handfome fiiouider 
 of mutton fail, gibing ever tlie cabin. 
 
 In this he frequently tack us out a fiflitng ; and onet'me 
 inviting two or three perfons of diftinclion to go with him, 
 made provifions extraordinary, providing alfo three ruffes, 
 with powder and fhor, that they might have foTe fport at 
 fowling along the fea-coaft. The next morning the boat 
 was made clean, her ar.cient and pendants cut, ard every 
 thing ready ; but their minds altering, my patron ordered' 
 us to go a flming, for that his guefts would certainly flip 
 with him that night. 
 
 And now 1 began to think of my deliverance indeed. In 
 order to this 1 perfuaded the Moor ko get fome providers 
 on board, as not daring to meddle with our patron's; and 
 he taking my advice, ue tfojed ourleives with rufk bifcuit, 
 and three jars of water, B^iidcs, I privately conveyed 
 into the boat a bottle of brandy, fome. twine, thread, a Lam* 
 mer, hatch-t, and a faw ; and, in particular, fume b»es-wax f - 
 which was a gr?at comfoit to me, ard ferved to make can- 
 dles. 1 ;hen pcrfuaded Muley (for fo was the Moor called) 
 to procure fome powder and ihot, pretending to kill fea cur« 
 Jews, which he innocently and readily agreed to- In ihott, 
 being provided^with all things neceilWr, we fai'ed out, re- 
 viving for my own pare lo make mv ekape, though it mould 
 coil me my life. 
 
 \Vnen we h?d paflVd the cafrle, .we fell a Tithing; .p&t 
 though I knew there was a bite, I diflVmbled the matter, in 
 order to put o,ut further to fea' Acci.rd'ngly we ran aJeague 
 fjrther ; when giving the boy the helm, and pretending to 
 froop for fomething, I felzed Muley by ftrpnfe a^d iftraw 
 him overboard. As He w.^s an excellent fwimmer, he foon 
 arofr, ard made towards the bjat ; upen which, I tu*k out 
 a fufee, and prefented at him: «' Muley," Taid I, Pd nev r 
 ''yet dtfigned to do you any harm, and -feck nothing - 
 
 AG 
 
 
 «'but jny redemption. I know you are ab!e enough to (Wim 
 "l" ihore, ard fave your life ; but if you are refolved to 
 " follow me, to the endangering of mine, the very moment 
 u ycu proceed, I will moot you through the head/* The 
 harmlefs creature at thefe words, turned himfelf from me, 
 and I make no doubt got fafe to land. Then turning to the 
 boy ( Xury, I perceived he trembled at the aaion ; but I pat 
 him cut of all fesr, telling him, that if he would be true and 
 faithful to me, I would do well by him. c4 And therefore," 
 faid 1, " yon muit ilrokeyour face to be faithful ; and, as the 
 :f Turks have learned you, fwear by Mahomet, and the beard 
 "of your father, or eKe I will throw you into the feaalfo." 
 So innocent did the child then look, and with fuch an oblig- 
 ing finite co.:fented, that I readily believed him, and from 
 that dav fat* ard began to love him entirely. 
 
 We th«n purfued our voyage; a-d left they (hould think 
 me gone to the (traits' mouth, 1 kept to the fouthward to 
 Die truly Barbarian coa ft ; but in the dufk of the evening. I 
 ^changed mycourfe v , and iieering diredUy S. and by E. that I 
 might keep near ti>e (here ; ar.d having a frefh gale of wind, 
 with a plea fa nt fm oath fea, by lhr?e o'ejkek next day [was 
 -one hundred ai;d fifty miiesbeyond the Emperor of Morocco's 
 "'deminiens. Ytt (rifl having the dreadful apprehenficn of 
 being retake*., 1 continued failing for five days fucceffively, 
 till fuch time as the wind fhifiing to the fouthward, made me 
 conclude, that if any veffel Wa*, in chafe ol me, they would 
 proceed no farther. Alter fo^much fitigue and thought, f 
 anchmd at* the mouth of a little river, 1 knew not what or 
 where; neither c id 1 then fee any people. What I principally 
 wanted wa* frelh water ; and I wa> refolved about dofk to 
 iwim aiho.e. But r,o fooner d\d the gloomy cl uds of night 
 begin, to focce<d^the declining d*y, when we heard fuch 
 barking, roaring, ard howling of wild creatures, that one 
 migh nave thought the very ilrongcfi: monflers of nature, or 
 infernal fpirits had their rriidence '.here. Poor Xur), almoft 
 read with fear, entreated me not to go en fhore that night. 
  Suppofing 1 d;.a% Xury/' faid I, "and in the morning *e 
 44 lhoujd fee - men who a;e worfe than thofe we frar, what 
 < then?'* "O den we may give dem de (hoo f gun," replied Xory, 
 h u^hing, "a< d degun makedem all run away.*' The wit and 
 b often Engliih which the boy had lean ed among the captives 
 of our nation, pealed me entirely; and to add to his cheer- 
 fulnefs, I gave him a dram of the bottle. Wt could get bus 
 
 
 little flcep all the night for thofe terrible bowlings they made ; 
 and, indeed, we were both very much affrighted, when, by 
 the rolling of the water, and other tokens, we juftly con- 
 cluded one of thofe menfters made towards our boat. I could 
 not fee, till it came within two oars length, when taking my 
 fufee, I let fly at him. Whether I hit him or no, I cannot 
 tell ; but he made towards the (hoic, and the noife of my 
 gun increafed the flupendous noife of the monflers. 
 
 The next morning I was refolved to go on fhore to get 
 frefh water, and venture my life among the beails or favages, 
 mould either attack me, Xury faid, he would take one of 
 the jars and bring me form*. 1 a/ked him, why he would 
 go, and not 1? The poor boyanfwered, ."if wild mans come, 
 tney eat me, you go away." A mind fcarcely now to be 
 imitated, fo contrary to felf- preservation, the moil powerful 
 law of Nature. This, indeed, increafedjmy affeclions to the 
 child. u Weil, dear Xury," faid I, " we will both go aihcre > 
 both kill wild mans, and they (hall eat neither of us." So 
 giving Xary a piece of rufk-bread to eat, and a dram, we 
 waded alhore, carrying nothing with us but our arms, and 
 two jars of water, i did not go out of fight of the boat, as 
 dreading the favages coming down the river in their canoes; 
 but the boy feeing a low defcent or vale about a mile in the 
 country, he wandered to it : and then running back to me 
 with great precipitation, I thought he was purfued by fome 
 favage or wild b«aft ; upon which I approached, refolving 
 to perim or protect him from danger. As he came nearrr 
 to me, I faw fomething hanging over his Sioulders, which 
 was a creature he had (hot like a hare, but different in colour, 
 and longer legs; however we were gkd of it, for ij proved 
 wholefomeand nouriihing meat : but what added to our joy 
 wa.s, my boy affured me there was plenty of water, and that 
 he fee no <wildmans. And greater ftill w£s our comfort, when 
 the tide was out, without going fo far up into the country. 
 
 In this place I began toconfiderthat the Canary and Ca per 
 de Verde iflands lay not far off; but having no initruruent, 
 J knew not what latitude, or when to tfand off to fea for 
 them ; yet my hopes were I fhould meet fome of the Eng- 
 lifh trading veffels, who would relieve and take us in. 
 
 The place 1 was in was no doubt that wild country, in- 
 habited only* by a hw 9 that lies between the Emperor of 
 Morocco's dominions and the Negroes. It is filled with 
 wild beads, and the Mcors ufe it for hunting chiefly. From 
 
 
 this p 1 aee Fthougbt I faw the top of the mountain Tene riff 
 in the Canaries -^ which made me try twice to attain it; 
 but as often was-T drove back> and fo forced to purfue my 
 
 .fortune along (hore. 
 
 Early one morning we came to an anchor unier a liu'e 
 point of land, but pretty high : and the* tide beginning t$ 
 Bow, we lay ready to go further in. Bat Xury, whofe 
 youthful and penetrating eyes were fharper than mine, in a 
 foft tone, deil red me to keep far frGPa land, left we mould- 
 be devoured,, *f For look yonder, mailer, " faid he, '^and fee 
 44 de dreadful mender fait afleep on de fide of de hill."—- 
 Accordingly looking where he pointed, I efpied a fearful 
 monfter indeed. It was a terrible great lien that lay on 
 flrore, covered as it were- by a {hade-- of a piece of the hilh 
 « 4 Xury," faid I, «-^ou (hail go on more and kill him." But 
 the boy looking amazed : ' 4 Me kiil him \" fays he, f< he eat 
 me at one mouh ;" meaning one mouthful. Upon which I 
 bid him lie {till, and charging my biggefl gun with two 
 flugs, and a good charge of powder, 1 took the beft aim I 
 could to (hoot him through the head, but his leg lying over 
 his nofey the Aug broke his knee bone. The lion awaking 
 with the pain* got up, bat (ocn feli down, giving the moft 
 hideous groan I ever heard : but taking my fecond piece, 
 I- {hot him through the head, and then he lay flruggling for< 
 life. Upon this Xury took heart, and defjred my leave to 
 go on fhore. "Go then," faid I. Upon which taking a 
 little gun in one hand, he fwam to (h ore with the other, and 
 coming clofe to the lior> put a period to his life by {hooting 
 him again through the head. 
 
 But this was {pending our ammunition in vain, the flefh 
 not being good to eat. Xury was like a champion, and 
 comes ori board for a hatchet, to cut off the h^ad of his ene- 
 my; but net having urength to perform it, he cut off and 
 brought me a foot. I bethoughr^me, however* that his fiun 
 v,ou;d be of ufe. This work c oft Xury and me a whole 
 day; when fp re a ding it on the top of our cabin, the hot 
 beams of the fun effectually dried it in two days' time, and 
 it afterwards ferved me f r a bed to lie on. 
 
 And now we failed foutherly, living fparingjy on our pro- 
 vifions, and went no oftener on (hore than we were ob iged 
 forfrefli water. My defign was to make the river Gambia 
 or Senegal, c.r any where about the Cape de Verde, in hopes 
 
 -to meet fome European (hip. If Providence did novfo fa* 
 
 
 
 vaur me, iriy next courfe was to feek for the iilands, or !ofe 
 my life amongft the Negroes. And, in a word, I put my 
 whole ftrefs upon this, " Either that I mud meet with 
 fome (hip* or certainly peri11i. ,> 
 
 One day as we were failing along, we faw people fiand 
 ©n the more looking at us; we could aifo perceive they 
 were black and ftark naked. I was inclined to go on tore, 
 but Xury cried, <c No, no;*' however, 1 approached nearer, 
 and 1 found they run along the more by me a good way. 
 They had no weapons in their hands, except one, who held 
 a long (lick, which Xury told me was a lar.ee, with which 
 they could kill at a great diftance. 1 talked to them by figns, 
 and made them fenfible I wanted fomething to eat ; they 
 beckoned me to itop my boat, while two of them ran up 
 into the country, and in lefs than half an hour came back, 
 and brought with them two pieces of dried flefh and (ome 
 corn, which we kindly accepted ; and to prevent any fears 
 on either fide, they brought the food to the fhore, laid it 
 down, then went and ftood a great way of£ till we fetched 
 it on board, and then came clofe to t^s again. 
 
 But while we were returning thanks to them* being all we 
 could afford, two mighty creatures came from the m untains j 
 one as it were purfuing the other with great fury, which we 
 were the rather inclined to believe, as they feHom appear 
 but in the night; and botrrthefs Aviftly pa fling by the ne- 
 groes, jumped into the fea, wantonly fwimming about, as 
 though the diversion of the waters had putaftop to their fierce- 
 Ktfs* At latf one of them coming nearer to my boat than £ 
 expecledordefjred, I fhot himdire&lythrough the head; upon 
 which he funk immediately, yet rifing again, would nave 
 willingly made the (bore ; bat between the wound and the 
 ftrangling of the water, he died before he could reach it. 
 
 It is impoffible to exp:efs theconfternation the poor Ne- 
 groes were in at the firing of my gun ; much lei's can I men- 
 tion their farprife, when they perceived the creuurc to be 
 Bain by it. I ra,ade figns to them to dra v near it with a 
 rope, and then gave it them to hale on fliore. It was a beau- 
 tiful IroparJ, which made me defire its £kin, and the Ne- 
 groes feeming to covet the carcafe,! freely gave it to them. 
 As for the other leopard, it made to fhore, and ran with pro- 
 digious fwiftnefs out of fight. The Negroes having kindly 
 furnifhed me with water, asid with what roots and grains 
 their country afforded, I took my kave, and after eleven 
 
 
 
 days fail, came in fight of the Cape de Verde, and thofe 
 iflands called by its name. But the great diftance I was from 
 it, and fearing contrary winds would prevent my reaching 
 them, I begun to grow melancholy and deje&ed, when, upon 
 a fudden, Xury cried out, " Matter ! Matter ! a (hip with a 
 fail !" and locking as affrighted as if it was his mailer's (hip 
 fent in fearch of us. But I ft on discovered fhe was a Por- 
 tugueiefhip, as J thought bound to the coaft of Guinea for 
 Negroes. Upon which I drove for life to come up to them. 
 But vain had it been, if through their perfpeftive glaffes they 
 had not perceived me andfhoftened their fail to let me come 
 up. Encouraged at this, Lfet up my patron's ancient, and 
 fired a gun, both as fignals of diftrefs ; upon which they 
 very kindly lay to, fo that, in three hours time 1 came up 
 with thern. They fpoke to roe in Portuguefe, Spanifli, and 
 French, but nore of thefe did. I underftand ,• till at length 
 a Scots failcr called, and then I /told him I was an Englifh- 
 man, who had e leaped from the Moors at Salee ; upon 
 which they took me kindly on board, with all my effects. 
 
 Surely none can exprels the inconceivable joy I felt at 
 this happy deliverance ! who from being a late miferable 
 and forlorn creature, was not only relieved, but in favour 
 with the mafter of the (hip, to whom in return for my de- 
 liverance, I offered all 1 had. "Gcd forbid/* faid he # 
 5« that I ihould take any thing from you. Every thing fhall 
 <4 he delivered to you when you come to Brazil. If I have 
 t£ faved your life, it is no more than I fhould cxpeft to re- 
 '< ceivc myfelf from any other, when in the fame circum- 
 Cr ftance I fliould happen to meet the like deliverance.— r 
 <- And fnould I take from you what you have, and leave you 
 * s at Brazil, why, this would be only taking away a* life I 
 <f had given. My charity teaches me better. Thofe efFcfts 
 « c you have will fupport you there, and provide you a paf- 
 ?* fage home again.'' And, indeed, he acted with the ftrift- 
 eft juilice in what he did, taking my things into his pcuef- 
 fion, and giving me an exact inventory, even to my earthen 
 jars.. He bought my boat of me for the ftiip's ufe, giving 
 me a note of eighty pieces of eight, payable at Brazil; and 
 if any body offered more he would make it up. He alio 
 gave me fixty pieces for my boy Xury. It was with great 
 reluctance 1 was prevailed upon to fell the child's liberty* 
 wro had ferved me fo faithfully ; but the boy was willing 
 himftif; and it was agreed, that after ten years he fhookl 
 
 
 be made free, upon his renouncing Mahometanifm, and 
 embracing Christianity. 
 
 Having a pleafant voyage to the Brazils, we arrived iii 
 the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints Bay, in twenty- 
 two days after. And here I cannot forget the generous 
 treatment of the captain. He would take nothing for my 
 paflage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's fkin, and 
 thirty for the lion's. Every thing he caufed to be delivered, 
 and what I would fell he bought In fhort I made about 
 220 pieces of my cargo; and with this (lock I entered 
 once more, as I may fay, into the fcene of life. * 
 
 Bring recommended to an honeft planter, I lived with 
 him till fuch time as I was informed of the manner of their 
 planting and making fugar ; and feeing how well they 
 lived, and how fuddenly they grew rich, I was filled with a 
 deiire to fettle among them, and refolved to get my money 
 remitted to me, and to purchafe a plantation. 
 
 To be brief, I bought a fettlement next door to an honefl 
 and kind neighbour, born at Lifbon, of Englifh parents, 
 whofe plantation joining to mine, we improved it very ami- 
 cably together. Both cur (locks were low, and for two 
 years we planted only for food : but the third year we 
 planted fome tobacco, and each of us dreffed a large piece 
 of ground the enfuing year for planting canes. But now 
 I found how much I wanted afiiftancc, and repented the 
 lofs of my dear boy Xury. 
 
 Having none to afliil me, my father's words came into 
 my mind ; and I ufed to alk myfelf, if what I fought was 
 only a middle (lation of life, why could it not as well be ob- 
 tained in England as here ? When I pondered en this with 
 regret, the thoughts of my late deliverance forfook me. I 
 had none to converfe with but my neighbour ; no work to be 
 done but by my own hands ; it often made me fay, my con- 
 dition was like to that of a man caft upon a defolate ifland. 
 So unhappy are we in our reflections, fo forgetful of what 
 good things we receive ourfelves, and fo unthankful for 
 our deliverance from thofe calamities that others endure. 
 
 I was in feme meafure fettled, before the captain who 
 took me up departed from the Brazils. One day I went to 
 him, and told him what (lock I had in London, dcfiring his 
 affiftance in getting it remitted ; to which the good gentle- 
 man readily confented, but would only have me fend for 
 half my money, left it (hould mifcarry; which if it did £ 
 
 
 might flill have the remainder to fupport me ; and (o taking 
 letters of procuratioa of me, bid me trouble myfelf no far- 
 ther about it. ^ 
 
 And indeed wonderful wa-s his kindnefs- towards. me ; for 
 he not only procured the money I had drawn for upon my 
 captain's widow, but fent me over a fervant with a cargo 
 proportionable to my condition. He a Mb fent me over 
 tcols of all forts, ironr^ork, and utenfils neceffary for my 
 plantation, which proved to be of the greateft ufe to me 
 in my bufinefs. 
 
 Wealth now accumulating on me, and uncommon fuccefs 
 crowning my profperous labours, I might have relied happy 
 In that middle ftate of life my father had fo often recom- 
 mended ; yet nothing would content me, fuch was my evil 
 genius, but i muft leave this happy (lation, for a fool iih am- 
 bition in rinng ; and thus, once more, I cad fiiyfelf into the 
 greateft gulf of mifery that ever poor creauire fell into. 
 Having lived four years in Brazil, I had not only learned 
 the language, but ccmracled acquaintance with the moil 
 eminent plan ers, and even the merchants of St. Salvador; 
 ro whom, once, by way of difcourfe, having given account 
 of my two voyages to the coaft of Guinea, and the manner 
 of trading there for mere trifles, by which we furnifti our 
 plantations with negroes, they gave fuch attention to what I 
 laid, that three of them came one morning to me, and told 
 me they bad a fecret propofal to make. After enjoining me 
 to fecrecy, (it being an infringement on the powers of the 
 kings of Portugal and Spain,) they told me they had a mind 
 to lit out a (hip to go to Guinea, in order to fleck, the plan- 
 tation with Negroes, which as they could not be publicly 
 fold, they would divide among them ; and if I would go 
 their fuper-cargo in the fhip to manage the tracing part, I 
 . ihould have an equal (hare of the Negroes, without provi- 
 ding any flock. The thing indeed was fair enough, had I 
 been in another condition* But I was bom to be my own 
 deftroyer, could not refill the propofal, but accepted the of-* 
 fer upon condition of their looking after my plantation. So 
 making a fjrmal will, I bequeathed my cf&6b to my good 
 friend the captain, as my univerfal heir ; but obliged him 
 to difpofe of my effeds as directed, one half of the produce 
 to hirafelf, and the other to be (hipped to England. 
 
 The (hip being fitted out, and all things ready, we fet 
 fell the firit of September, 1659, being the fame day eight 
 
 
 years I left my father and mother in YcrkHiire, We failed 
 nonhward upon the coaft, in order to gain Africa, till we 
 made Cape Auguftine ; from whence going fanner into the 
 ocean out of fight of land, we fleered as though we were 
 bound for the Ifle Fernar.d de Norenba, leaving ihe illands 
 on the ealt ; and then it was that we met with a terrible 
 tempeft, which continued for twelve days fucceilively* (o 
 that the winds carried us wherefoever they pleafed. In this 
 perplex ! ty one of our men died, and one man and ahoy 
 were wafhed overboard. When the weather cleared up a' 
 little, we found ourfelyes in eleven degrees north latitude, upon. 
 the coafl of Guinea. Upon tbis the captain gav r e reafons 
 for returning; which I oppofed, counfelling him to ft and 
 away Jor Bar Dadoes j which, as I fupp;fed, might be attained 
 in fifteen days, So altering cur courfe, we failed norcfe- 
 vvefi and by wed, in order to reach the Leeward iftauds; 
 but a fecpnd ilorm fucce?ding, drove us to the weftward ; 
 fo t' at we 'were jufily afraid of failing into the hands of 
 cruel favages, or the paws of devouring h?afts of prey. 
 
 In this great dtftrefs, one of our men, early in live morn- 
 ing, cried our, "Land, land !" which he had no fooner cried 
 out, but cur fh*p ftruck upon a fand-bank, and in a moment 
 the fea broke over her in fuch'.a manner, that we expe&ed 
 we fhould ail have -peri (hed immediately. We knew no- 
 thing where we were, or upon what land we were driven; 
 wh.th.er an'ifland or the main, inhabited or not inhabited; 
 and we could not fo much as hope that the (hip. would hold out 
 many minutes, without breaking in pieces, except ihe wind* 
 by a miracle, fhould turn about immediately. While we 
 flood looking at one another, expecling death every moment, 
 the mate lays hold of the boat, and with the he;p of the reft 
 got her iiung over the (hip's fide, and getting all into her* 
 being eleven of us, committed ourfelves to God's mercy and 
 the wild fea. And now we faw that this laft effort would 
 not be fufficient protection from death ; fo high did the fea 
 rife, that it was imrJafiible the boat fhould live. As to ' 
 making fail, we had none; neither if we had, could we 
 make ufe of any. So that when we had rowed, or rather 
 were driven about a league and a half, a raging wave, like 
 a laky mountain, came rolling a-ftern of us, and took us 
 with fuch fury, that at once it overfet the boat. Thus being 
 fwallowed up in a moment, we had hardly time to call up m 
 the tremendous name of God; much lefs to implore, in dying 
 ejaculations^ his infinite mercy to receive our departing fouls, 
 
 
 Men are generally counted infenfible when struggling m 
 the pangs of death; but while I was overwhelmed with 
 water, 1 had the mod dreadful apprehenfions imaginable. 
 For the joys of heaven and the torments of hell, feemed to 
 prefent themfelves before me in thefe dying agonies, and 
 even fmallfpaee.of time, as it were, between life and death* 
 I was going I thought I knew not whither, into a difmal 
 gulf unknown, and as yet unperceived, never to behold 
 my friends, nor the light of this world any more ! Could I 
 even have thought of annihilation, or a total diffolution of 
 foul as well as body, the gloomy thoughts of having no far- 
 then being, no knowledge of what we hoped for, but an 
 eternal quietus, without life or fenfe : even that, I fay, 
 Would have been enough to ftrike me with horror and con- 
 fufion ! I flrove, however, to the lad extremity, while all 
 my companions were overpowered and entombed in the 
 deep: and it was with great difficulty I kept my breath till 
 the wave fpent itfelf, and retiring back, left me on the fhore 
 half dead with the water I had taken in. As Toon as I got 
 on my feet, I ran as fall as I could, left another wave 
 fhould purfue me, and carry me back again. But for all 
 the hafte I made, I could not avoid it : for the fea came 
 after me like a high mountain, or furious enemy ; fo that 
 my bufinefs was to hold my breath, and by railing myfelf 
 on the water, preferve it by fwimming. The next dread- 
 ful wave buried me at once twenty or thirty feet deep, but at 
 the fame time carried me with a mighty force and fwiftnefs- 
 towards the fhore; when raifing myfelf, I held out as well 
 as poffible, till at length the water having fpent itfelf, be- 
 gan to return, at which I itruck forward, and feeling ground 
 with my feet I took to my heels again. Thus beingferved 
 twice more, I was at length daihed againft a piece of rock^ 
 in fuch a manner as left me fenfclefs; but recovering a 
 little before the return of the wave, which, no doubt, would 
 then have overwhelmed me, I held faft by the rock till thofe 
 Succeeding waves abated ; and then fetching another run, 
 was overtaken by a fmall wave, which was foon conquered^ 
 But before any more could overtake me, I reached the main 
 land, when clambering up the clifts of the (liore, tired and 
 almoft fpent I fat down on the grafs, free from the dangers 
 of the foaming ocean. 
 
 No tongue can exprefs the ecftaCes and transports that 
 nay foul felt at the happy deliverance. It was like a reprieve 
 
 
 to a dying malefa&or, with a halter about his neck, and 
 ready to be turned off. I was wrapt up in contemplation, 
 and often lifted up my hands, with the profoundeft humility, 
 to the Divine Power?, for faving my life, when the reft of 
 my companions were all drowned. And now I began to 
 caft my eyes around, to behold what plac« I was in, and 
 what I had next to do, I could fee no houfe nor people ; I 
 was wet, yet had no clothes to (hift me ; hungry and thirfty, 
 yet had nothhig to eat or drink ; no weapon to deflroy any 
 creatures for my (udenance, nor defend myfelf againft de- 
 vouring beafts; in (hort, I had nothing but a knife, a 
 tobacco pipe, and a box half filled with tobacco* The 
 darkfome night coming on upon me, increased my fears of 
 being devoured by wild creatures ; my mind was plunged 
 in defpair, and having no profpeel, as I thougbt, of life be- 
 fore me, I prepared for another fcind of death than what I 
 Jiad lately efcaped. I walked about a furlong to fee if I 
 could find any frefh water^ which I did to my great joy; 
 and taking a quid^of tobacco *o prevent hunger, I got up 
 into a thick bufhy tree, and feating myfelf fo that I could 
 not fall, a deep fleep overtook me, and for that night buried 
 my forrows in a quiet repofe. 
 
 It was brpad day the next morning before I awaked,; 
 when I not only perceived the temped was ceafed, but faw 
 the -(hip- driven almod as far as the rock before- mentioned, 
 which the waves had dafhed me againii, and which was 
 about a mile from the place where I was. When I came 
 down from my apartment in the tree, i perceived the (hip's 
 boat two miles diftant on my right-hand, lying on (hore, as 
 the waves had cad her. I thought to have got to her ; but 
 there being an inlet of water of about half a mile's breadth 
 between it and me, I returned again towards the (hip, as 
 hqping to find Something for my more immediate fubfift- 
 *noe. About noon, when the fea was calm, that I could come 
 within a quarter of a mile of her, it was to my grief that I 
 perceived, that if we had kept on bo~rd all our lives had 
 been faved. Thefe thoughts, and my folitude, drew tears 
 from my eyes, though all in vain. So refolving to get to 
 the (hip, I dripped and leapt into the water; when fwim- 
 ming round her, I was afraid I (hould not get any thing to 
 lay hold of; but it was rr y good fortune to efpy a fm all 
 piece of rope hang down by the fore-chains, fo low that, by 
 the he*p of it though with great difficulty, I got into the 
 
 
 forecaftle of the (hip- Here I found that the (hip was 
 bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold ; her flem 
 was lifted up againfi a bank, and her head almoft to the 
 water. All her quarters, and what was there, was free and 
 dry. The prcvifions I found in good order, with which I 
 crammed my pockets, and lofing no time, ate while I was 
 doing other things; I alfo found fome rum, of which I took 
 a hearty dram; and now I uanted for nothing except a 
 - boat, which indeed was all, to carry away what was need- 
 ful for me. 
 
 Neceffity occafions quicknefs of thought We had fe- 
 veral fpaie yards, a fpare topmaft or two, and two or three 
 large fpars of wood. With thefe I fell to work, and flung 
 as many- of them overboard a3 I could manage, tying every 
 one of them with a rope, that they might not drive away. 
 This done I went^down to the fhip's fide, and tied four of 
 them faft together at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying 
 two or three fnort pieces of plank upon them crofTwife, I 
 found it would bear me, but not any confiderable weight. 
 Upon which I went to work again, cutting a fpare topmaft 
 into three lengths, adding them to my raft with a great deal 
 of labour and pains. I then confidered what I fhcuid load 
 it with, it being not able to bear a ponderous burden. And 
 this I foon thought of, fif ft laying upon it all the planks and 
 boards I could get; next I lowe ed down three of the fea- 
 men's cherts, after I had filled them with bread, rice, three 
 Dutch cheefes, five pieces of dried goat's fleih, and fome 
 European corn, what little the rats had fpared ; and for 
 liquofs, I found feveral cafes of bottles belonging to our 
 Ikipper, in which were fome cordial waters, and four or 
 five gallons of rack, which I flowed by themfelves. By 
 this time the tide beginning to flow, I perceived my coat, 
 waiftcoat, and fhirt, fwim away, which I had left on the 
 fhore; as fpr my linen-breeches and flockings, I fwam with 
 them to the fhip; but i foon found clothes enough, though I 
 took no more than I wanted for the prefent. My eyes were 
 chiefly en tools to work with ; and, after a long fearch, I 
 found out the carpenter's cheft, which I got fafe down on 
 my raft. I then looked for arms and ammunition, and in the 
 great cabin found two good fowling-pieces, two piftols, fe- 
 veral powder-hcrns filled, a fmall bag of fhot, and two bid 
 jufty fwords. I likewife found three barrels of powder, 
 two of which were good, but the third had taken water, 
 
 
 alfo two cr three broken oars, two faws, an ax, and a ham- 
 mer. I then put to Tea, and in getting to fhorc had three 
 encouragement*. 1. A fmooth calm fea. 2. The tide 
 riling and fetting in to fhore. 3. The Utile vvkd there was 
 blew towards the land. After I had failed about a mile, I 
 found the raft to drive a litt'e diftarce from the place where 
 1 firft landed; and then I prrceived a little opening of the 
 land, with a ftrong current cf the tide running into it: up* 
 on which I kept the middle of the dream. But great was 
 my concern, when on a fudden the forepart of my raft ran 
 aground, fo that had I nor, with great difficulty, for near 
 half an hcur, kept my back draining againd the chefls to 
 keep my effects in their places, all I had would have gone 
 into the fea. But after feme time, the riling of the water 
 caufed the raft to float again, and coming up a little river 
 with land on both fides, I landed in a little cave, as near the 
 mouth as poUible, the better to difcover a fail, if any fuch 
 providentially patted that way. 
 
 Not far off, I efpied a hill of ftupendous height, fur- 
 rounded with lefler hills about it, and thither I was refolved 
 to go and view the country, that I might fee what part 
 was bell to fix my habitation. Accordingly, arming my- 
 Mf ? with a pidol, a fowling-piece, powder and ball, I af- 
 cended the mountain. - There I perceived I was in an ifland, 
 e.ncompafled by the fea, no diftant. lands to be feen but 
 fcattcring recks that lay to the weft : that it feemed to 
 be a barren place, and as I thought, inhabited enly by wild 
 beafts. I perceived abundance of fowls, but ignorant of 
 what kind, or whether good for rourifhment; I fnot one of 
 them at my return, which occasioned a confufed fcreaming 
 among the other birds, and I found it by its colour and beak 
 to be a kind of hawk, but its flelh was perfect carrion. 
 
 When 1 came to my raft, I brought my efTecls on fhore, 
 which work fpent that day entirely ; and fearing that fofne 
 cruel beads might devour mc in the nuhttime whi'el flept, I 
 made a kind of hut or barricade with the chefts and boards 
 I had brought on fhore. Th*t night 1 flept very comfort- 
 ably ; and the next morning my thoughts were employed to 
 make a further attempt on the fhip, and bring away what 
 neceflaries I could find, before another dorm ihouid break 
 her to pieces. Accordingly I got on board as before, and 
 prepared a fecond raft far more nice than the firft, upon 
 which I brought away the carpenter's dorrs, two or tlitae 
 
 
 bags full of nails, a great jack-fcrew, a dozen or two of 
 
 hatchets, and a grind-Hone. 1 alfo took away feveral things 
 
 that belonged to the gunner, particularly two or three iron 
 
 crows, two barrels of mufket-bullets, another fowling piece, 
 
 a fmall quantity of powder, and a large bagful of fmall (hot. 
 
 Befides thefe, I took all the men's clothes I could find, a 
 
 {pare fore top-fail, a hammock, and fome bedding; and 
 
 thus completing my fecond cargo, I made all the hafte to 
 
 ihore I could, Fearing fonve wild beaft might deflroy what 
 
 I had there already. But I only found a little wild cat 
 
 fitting cm ont of the chefts, which feeming not to fear me 
 
 Or the gun that I prefented at her, I ihrew her a piece of 
 
 bifcuit, which me inftantly ate and departed. 
 
 . When I had gotten theie effects on more, I went to work, 
 
 in order to make me a little tent with the fail and fome poles 
 
 which I had cut for that purpofe; and having finifhed it, 
 
 what things might be damaged by the weather I brought 
 
 in, piling all the empty chefts and calks in a circle, the 
 
 better to fortify it again!* any fudden attempt of man or 
 
 beaft. After this I blocked up the doors with iome boards, 
 
 and an empty cheft, turned the long way out. I then 
 
 charged my gun and piftol, and laying my bed on the 
 
 ground, flept as comfortably, till &ext morning, as though * 
 
 had been in a Chriilian country. 
 
 Now, though I had enough to fubfift me a long time, y 
 defpairing of a fudden deliverance, or that both ammunitio 
 and provifion might be fpent before fuch thing happened, I 
 coveted as much as I could; and fo long as the fhip re- 
 mained in that condition, I daily brought away one necef* 
 fary or other ; particularly the rigging, fails, and cordage, 
 fome twine, a barrel of wet powder, fome fugar, a barrel 
 of meal, three calks of ruin, and^ what indeed was moft 
 welcome to me, .a whole hogfhead of bread. 
 
 The next time I went I cut the cables in pieces, carried 
 off a hawfer whole, with a great deal of iron-work, and 
 made another raft with the mizen and fprit-faii yard; but 
 this be ing fo unweildy, by the too heavy burden I had upon 
 it, and not being ablefo dexterously to guide it as the former, 
 both my cargo and I were overturned. For my part, all 
 the damage I fuflained was a wet ikin ; and, at low water, 
 after much labour in diving, I got moil of the cables, and 
 fome pieces of iron. 
 Thirteen days I had now been in the ifland, and eleve*

 time* ca board, bunging away all that was poffible ; and I 
 believe had the weather been calm, I mould have brought 
 away the whole (hip piece by piece. As I was going the 
 twelfth time, the wind began to nfe ; however 1 ventured 
 at low water, and rummaging the cabin, in a locker I found 
 feveral razors, fcifTors, and feme dozens of knives, and 
 forks; and in another thirty-fix pounds of pieces of eight, 
 filver and geld. " Ah ! fimple vanity,'* faid I, "whom 
 /'this' world fo much dotes on, where is now thy virtue, thy 
 " excellency to me? You cannot procure, me one thing 
 is needful, nor ^remove me from this defolate ifland to a 
 u place of plenty. One of thefe knives, fo meanly 'eiieemed, 
 "is to me mere preferable than all this heap. E'en, there- 
 «*fore, remain where t-hou art, to fink in the deep as unre- 
 ** garded, even as a creature whofe life is not worth pre- 
 *< ferving." Yet, after all this exclamation, I wrapt it up in a 
 piece of canvas, and began to think of making another raft : 
 but I foon perceived the wind began to arife, a frefh gale 
 blowing from the fherc, and the iky overcaft with clouds 
 and darknefs ; fo thinking a raft to be in vain, I let rn^felf 
 into the water, with what things I had about me, and it was 
 with much difficulty I got afhore, when foon after it blew 
 a fearful itqrm. 
 
 That night 1 flept very contentedly in my little tent, fur- 
 rounded with all my effects ; but when 1 looked out in the 
 morning, no more fhip was to be fee n. This ranch fur- 
 prifed me for the prefent ; yet, when I considered I had loft 
 no time, abated no pains, and had got every thing ufefui 
 out of her, I comforted myfelf in the bell manner, and 
 entirely fubmitted to the will of Providence. 
 
 My next thoughts were, how I fhould defend and fecure 
 myfelf. from favages and wild beafts, if any fuch were in 
 the ifland. At one time I thought of digging a cave; at 
 another I was for erecting a tent ; and, at length, I refolved 
 to do both: The manner or form of which wiil not, I hepe, 
 be unpleafing to defcribe. 
 
 When I confidered the ground where I was, that it was 
 moorifh, and had no frefh water near it, my refolutions 
 t were to fearch for a foil healthy and well watered, where I 
 I might not Only be flickered from the fun's fcorching heat, 
 but be more conveniently fuuated, as well to be fecured 
 from wild men and beafts of prey, as more eafily to difcover 
 any diftant fail, fhould h ever fo happen. 
 
 B 
 
 
 And, indeed, it was not long before I had my defire. 1 
 found a little p'ain near a riling hill, the front towards 
 v/hich being as flee p as a houfe-fide, noihing could defcend 
 en me from the top. On the fide of this rock was a little 
 hollow place, refembling the entrance or door of a cave. 
 Juft before this place, on the circle of the green, I refclved 
 my tent fhould ftand. This plain did not much exceed 
 a. hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, like a de- 
 lightful green before my door, with a pleafing though an 
 irregular defcent every way to the low grounds by tfie fea- 
 Tide, lying on the N. W. fide of the hill; to- that it was 
 fhekered from the exceflive heat of the fun. After this, I 
 drew a femi-circle, containing ten yards in a femi-diameter, 
 and twenty yards in the whole, driving down two rows of 
 Urong flakes, not frx inches from each o^her. Then with a 
 piece of cable which I had cut on board, 1 regularly laid 
 them in a circle between the piles up to their tops, which 
 were more than five feet out of the earth, and after -drove 
 another row of piles looking within fide again (1 them, be- 
 tween two or three feet high, which made me conclude it a 
 little impregnable caille againii men and beads. And for 
 my better fecurity I would have no door, but entered in and 
 came out by the help of a ladder, which I alfo made. 
 
 Here was my fence and fortrefs, into which I carried all 
 my riches,- ammunition and llores. After which, working 
 on the rock, what with dirt and ftones I dug out, I not 
 only raifed my ground two feet, but made a little cellar to 
 my manfion-houfe ; and this coft me many days labour and 
 pains. One day,' in particular, a fhower of rain falling, 
 thunder and lightning enfued, which put mc in terror led 
 my powder fhould take lire, and not only hinder my ne« 
 cefTary fubftflence, my killing me food, bat-even blown up 
 me and my habitation. To prevent which, 1 fell to making 
 boxes and bags, in ofHer to feparate it, having by me near 
 ]50lb. weight. And thus being eftablifhed as king of the 
 ifLtnd, every day I went cut with my gun to lee what I 
 cojld kill that was fit to eat. I fcon perceived numbers of 
 goats, but very fhy ; yet having watched them narrowly, 
 and feeing I could better moot off the rocks than when in 
 the low grounds, I happened to (hoot ame-goat fuckling a 
 young kid; which not thinking its dxim flain, Hood by her 
 unconcerned; and when I took the deatf creature up, the 
 young one followed me even to the inclofure*^ I lifted the 
 
 
 kid over the pales, and would willingly have kept it alive -j 
 but finding it could not be brought to eat, I was forced to 
 flay it alfo for my fubfiftence. 
 
 Thus entering into as itrar.ge a fcene Of life as ever any 
 man was in, I had moil melancholy apprehenfions concern- 
 ing my deplorable condition : and many times the tears 
 would plentifully run down my face, when I coniidered 
 how I was debarred from ail communication with human 
 kind. Yet while thefe defponding cogitations would feem 
 to make me accufe Providence, other good thoughts would 
 interpofe and reprove me after this manner : Well, fuppa- 
 iing you are defola*e, is it not better to be fo than totally 
 perilh ? Why were you fingled out to be fayed, and the reft 
 deilroyed? Why mould you complain, when not only your 
 life is preferved, but the th'\p driven even into your reach, m 
 order to take what was neceiTary cut of her for your fub- 
 fiftence ? But to proceed. It was, by the account I kept, 
 the 30th of September, when I firfl: landed on this iiland. 
 -About twelve days after, fearing left I mould lofe my 
 reckoning of time, nay, even forget the Sabbath day*, for' 
 want of pen, i k, and paper, I carved with a fc'niie upon a 
 large noil, in great letters, and fet it up, in the fimilitudeof 
 a cro/s en the feafhore where I landed, / came en Jh ore, 
 -Sept. 30, 1059. Every'day I cut a notch with my knife on 
 the fides of this fquare port, and that on the Sabbath was as 
 -long aga'n as the reit; and every firft day of the month as 
 Jong again as that long onf. In this manner I kept my ca- 
 lendar, weekly, monthly, or yearly reckoning of time. But 
 had 1 made a more tf-ricl fearch (as afc wards I did) I 
 needed not have fet up this mark; for among the- parcels 
 belonging to the gunner, carpenter, and captain's mate, [ 
 found thofe* very things 1 wanted; particularly pens, ink^ 
 and paper : alfo 1 found two or three compares, fome i 
 thematical inilruments, dials, perfpe&ive ghiTes, books of 
 navigation, three Englifh Bibles, and {Several other good 
 books, which i carefully put up. — Here I ear-not but -call to 
 mind our having a dog and two ,cats en board, whom f 
 made inhabitants with me in my caftte. Though o;;e niight 
 think I had all the necefiaries that were dedr^ble yec ft ill 
 I found feveral things wanting. My ink was dfcily wailing; 
 J wanted needles, pins, and thread to mend or keep my 
 clothes together; and particularly a fpade, pickaxe, or 
 ihovel, to remove the earth. It was a year before 1 £ni&ed 
 
 
 my little bulwark ; and having fome intervals of relaxation, 
 mfter my daily wandering abroad fVr provificm, I drew up 
 this plan, alternately, as creditor and debtor, 10 remind me 
 ©f the iriferics and blc flings of my life, under fo many 
 various CKCurnftances; 
 
 GOOD. 
 
 I am cast upon a, desolate 
 island, having no hopes, no 
 prospect of a welcome de- 
 liverance. 
 
 Mow miserable am I sin- 
 gled out front the enjoyment or 
 company of mankind. 
 
 Like an hermit f rat Iter 
 should I say a lonely an- 
 chorite J am I forced from 
 human conversation. 
 
 My clothes after some time 
 will be worn out ; and then 1 
 shall have none to cover me. 
 
 When my ammunition is 
 wasted, then 1 shall r twain 
 without any defence against 
 wild men and beasts. 
 
 1 have no creature, no soul 
 io speak to ; none to he\ 
 ,aUi-sthnce from. Some com- 
 fort would it be to resound 
 my woes where 1 -am under- 
 r> assistance 
 
 stood, and 
 
 I might hope for re lief. 
 
 But yet I am preserved 
 while my companions are pe- 
 rished in the raging ocean. 
 
 Yet set apart to be spared 
 from death. And he, who 
 has so preserved mc, can dc~ 
 liver me font this condition. 
 
 However, I have food to eat 9 
 and even a happy prospect of 
 subsistence whilst life en~ 
 d ures. 
 
 At present I enjoy what is 
 absolutely needful ; and the 
 ciriiate is so hot, that had I 
 never so many, J should 
 hardly wear them. 
 
 Yet if it docs, I see no dan- 
 ger of any hurt to me, as in Af- 
 rica : And what if I had been 
 cast away upon that coast ; 
 
 Is there not God to con- 
 verse to, and is not he able 
 to relieve thee ? Already has 
 he afforded thee sustenance, 
 and put it in thy poivCr to 
 provide for thyself till he 
 sends thee.a deliverance. 
 
 And now eafing my mind a little by thefe reflections, 
 I began to render my life as eafy as pofiible. 
 
 I xnu'* here add, to the description I have given of my 
 habitation, that having raifed a turf-wall againit the outftde 
 of it, I thatched it fo clqfe, as might keep it from the incle- 
 mency of the weather ; I alio improved it within, enlarged 
 my cave, and made a pafTage and door in. the rock, which 
 came out beyond the pale of my fortification. I next pro- 
 ceeded to make a chair and a table, and fo began to fludy 
 fuch mechanical arts as fecmed to me practicable. When 
 
 
 I wanted a plank or board, I hewed down a tree with my 
 hatchet, making it as thin with my axe as pofiiblc, and then 
 fmooth enough with an adze to anfwer my defigns i yet 
 thought I could make no more this way than one board out 
 of a tree, in length of time I got boards enough to fhelter 
 all roy tf ores, every thing being regularly placed, and my 
 guns fecurely hanging- againfl the fide of the rock. . Thia 
 made it a very pleaiarit fight to me, as being the refult of 
 vail labour and diligence ; which leaving for a while, and 
 me to the enjoyment of it, I Avail give the reader an account 
 of my Journal from the day of my landing, till the fixing 
 and fettling of my habitation, as heretofore mown. 
 
 JOURNAL, 
 
 September 30th, 1659, I, unhappy - Robiafon Crufoe* 
 having fmfered fhipwreck, was driven 01 this defolate 
 Iflan£, which I named the Defolare Iiland of Defpair, my 
 companions being fwallcwed up in the tempeftuous ocean. 
 The .next day I ipent in consideration of my unhappy cir- 
 cumilances, having no profpeel: but of death, either £&b¥ 
 flarved with hunger, or devoured with beafts or mercilefa 
 favages. - 
 
 Oft. 1. That morning with great comfort I beheld the 
 /hip drove a&ore. Some hopes I had, that when the Aorta 
 was abated, I might be able to get fome food and oecef- 
 faries out of her, which I conceived were not damaged, be- 
 cause the fhjp did Hand upright. At this time I lamented 
 the lofs of my companions, and our misfortune in leaving the 
 vefTel. When I perceived the ihip, as it were, lie dry, I 
 waded through the fands, then fwam aboard, the weather 
 being very rainy, and with fcarcely any wind. 
 
 To the 14th of this month, my time wa« employed in 
 making voyages, every tide getting what i could out ci the 
 fhip. The; weather very wet ai»d unce.t-A-in. 
 
 Oct. 20. My raft ,% d all the goods tnoeon were over- 
 fet ; yet I recovered mo& again at low water. 
 
 Oft. 25. It blew hard, and rained night and dav, when 
 the Ihip went in pieces, fo chat nothing was ken of her but 
 tne wreck at low watrr. Tr»is day I fecured rny g^ods franv 
 the inclemency of Cm weatlur.

 Ocr. 2o\ T wandered to Tee whe?e I could find a place 
 convenient for my abode. I fixed upon a rock in the even- 
 ing, marked out a half-moop, intending to erecl a wall, 
 notified with pile*, lined within with pieces of cables, and 
 covered with eurf. 
 
 Nov. 1. I ere/led my tent under a rock, and took up 
 my lodgings very contentedly in a hammock thaunight. 
 
 Nov. 2. This day 1 fenced my felf in with timber, chefU, 
 HT>d boards. 
 
 Nov. 3. 1 {hot two wild fowls, refernbiing ducks, which 
 were good to gat, and in the afternoon made me a table. 
 
 Nov. 4. I b?gah to live regularly. In the morning, I 
 allowed myie'f two or three hours to walk out with my gun ; 
 I then worked till near ele\en o'clock, and aXttr-x'&id* re- 
 f re (he-id my felf with what J had to eat. From twelve to 
 two I would lie down to fi;ep. Extremely fultry weather, 
 in the 'evening go to work again. 
 
 Nov. 5. Went out with my gun and dog, (hot a wild 
 cat with a ft ft ikin> but her fielh was good for nothing. 
 The feins of thofe I killed, I prefcrved. In my return, I 
 perceived many wild birds, and was terrified by Spine feals, 
 which made off to fea. 
 
 Nov. 6. - Completed* my t*blc. 
 
 Nov. 7. Fajr weather. I worked till the 1 2th, but 
 omitted the 1 Ith, which,, according to my calculation, I fup« 
 poied to be Sunday. 
 
 Nov. 13. Rain in abundance, which, however, much 
 cooled the air; with thunder and lightning, caufed In me a 
 terrible furpnfe. The weather clearing, 1 fccured my 
 povder in fepara|e parcels. 
 
 Nov. 14--— Id. i made iiitle boxes for my powder, lodg- 
 ing aJ places, i alfo Ihot" a large- fowl, which

 Lil for wan. of a pickaxe, (hovel, and wheelbarrow. Iron 
 crows I caufed t;> fupply the p'ace of the firft ; but with all 
 my art I co Ad not make a wheelbarrow. 
 
 Nov. IS. ft was my fortune to find a tree, refernbiing 
 what the Brazilians call an iron -tree, i had like to have failed 
 my axe with cutting ir, being very hard and exceedingly 
 heavy ; yet, with much labour and induftry, 1 made a fort 
 of a fpade out of it. 
 
 Nov. 23. Thefe tools being made, I daily carried on my 
 buftnels; eighteen da) s fallowed for enlarging my cave ?

 [hat it might ferve me, not only for a warehoufe, but kit- 
 chen, parlour, ; an i' cellar. I commonly lay in the tent, un- 
 iefs the weather was rainy that I could net lie dry. So wet 
 would it be at certain feafons, that I was obliged to cover 
 ail within the pale with long poles, in the form of lahers, 
 leaning againll the rock, and Itfaded them with flags and 
 large leaves of trees, refembling a thatch. 
 
 Dec. 10. No foon-r did I think my habitation finiihed, 
 but fuddenly- a great deal of the top broke in, Co that it was 
 a mercy I was no: buried in the ruins. This occafioned a 
 great deal of pains and trouble to me, before I could make 
 it firm and durable. 
 
 Dec 17. 1 nailed up fome (helves, and drove nails and 
 ilap'es in the wall and polls, to hang things or, of the way, 
 
 Dec. 20\ Every thing I got into its place, then made 
 a 'for; of a drefH-r, and another table. 
 
 Dec. 24-, 25. Rain in abundance. 
 
 Dec. 26\ Very fair weather. 
 
 Dzc. 27. I chanced to light on fome goats, (hot one, and 
 wounded" another. 1 led it hone in a itring, bound up its 
 leg, and cured it in a little time; at length it became (a 
 tar.ie and familiar as to fee i before the door, and follow me 
 where I pleafed. This put me in mind to bring up tame 
 creatures, in order to fupply me with food after my ammu- 
 nition- was fpent. 
 
 Dec. 28, 29, 30. The weather being ex ce (lively hot, 
 with little. air, obliged me, for the moil part, to keep within 
 doors. 
 
 Jan. I. Still fultry; however, obliged by'ncceflity, I wfnt 
 out with my gun, and found a great flore cf goats in the 
 valleys; they were exceedingly ihy, nor could my dog 
 hunt them down. 
 
 Jan. 3 to 14. My employment this time was to finifli the 
 wall before defcribed, and fearch the ifUnd. 1 difcovered 
 a kind of pigeons, like our houfe pigeons, in a neil among 
 the rocks. I brought them home, nuried them till they could 
 6V, and then they left me. After this, I (hot fome, which 
 proved excellent food. Some time I fpent vainly in con- 
 triving to make a cafk ;» I may well fay it'was v^in, becaufe 
 I could neither joint the ftaves, nor fix tre heads, fo as to 
 make it tight : So, leaving that, took fome goat's tallow I 
 had about me, and a little oakum for the wick, and provided 
 xnyfelf with a lamp, which fervedtne inilead of candles.

 Bat now a very fl range event happened. For being in 
 the heigh* of my fearch, what fliouid come into my hand, 
 but aba*, which ufed to hold corn (as I fuppofed) for the" 
 fowls ; (o immediately refolving to p it gunpowder in it, I 
 Ihook all the hulks and dirt upon one fide of the rock, little 
 expecting what the confequence would be. The rain bad 
 falls n .plentifully a few days before; and about a month 
 after, to my great amazement, fomethmg began to look out 
 vtry green and flouriihing ; and when I came to view it 
 more nicely every day as it grew, I found abott ten or 
 twelve ears of green barley appeared in the very fame fhape 
 and nir-ke as that in Englard. 
 
 I can fcarce exprefs the agitations of my mind at this 
 fight. Hitherto, I had looked upon the actions of this life 
 r>o cthftrwife' than only as the events of bli^d chance and 
 fortune. But no^ the appearance of this barley, flouriihing 
 in a barren foil, and my ignorance in not conceiving how it 
 ihould come there, made me conclude, that miracles were not 
 ytt ceufgd: nay I even thought that God had fppoinced it 
 u> grow there without any (ccd^ purely fcr my (uflenance 
 in this miferable and defolste ifl-and. And indeed fuch 
 great effect this had^upon roe, that it often made me melt 
 into te*rs, through a grateful fenfe cf God's mercies ; and 
 the gres;er ftifl v. as my thankfulnefs, when I perceived 
 about this little field of barley fume rice (talks, alfo wonder- 
 fully flour* (h'wg. 
 
 While ihus p'eafed in mind, I concluded there mufl be 
 more corn in the iiland ; and there/ore made a diligent, 
 fearch narrowly p.mcmg ih« -r'eks; but not being able to 
 find a>v, on a (uddf-.n it came into mind, how I had lhaken 
 the hulks of corn out of the bag, and then my admiration 
 ceafed, with my gratitude io the Divine Being, as thinking 
 it was but natural, and not to be conceived a miracle; though 
 even the manner of its prefervation might have made me 
 own it was a wonderful evert of God's kiod Providence. 
 
 It was about the latter er.d of June when the ears of 
 this corn ripened, which i laid up very carefuTy, together 
 with 20 or 30 tit Iks of rice, expecting ore day I fhould reap 
 the fruit of my labour ; yet four years were expired be- 
 fore I could allow myfelf to eat any barley bread, and much 
 longer time before I bad any rice. After this, with indefa- 
 tigab e pains and induilry, for three or four months, at lair. 
 I finifhed my wall on the 1 4th of April, having no way to 
 go into it, but by a ladder againfi the wall. 
 
 
 April 17. I finifhed my ladder, and afcended it ; after- 
 wards pulled it up , then let it down on t- e other fide, ard 
 defceaded into mv new habitation, where I had fpace 
 enough, and fo fortified that, nothing could attack me with- 
 out fcalmg the wall s^ 
 
 But. wnat does all human pains and induitry avail, if the 
 blelling of God does not crown our labours? Or who car* 
 Jtand before the Almighty, when he ftretcheih forth his arm?' 
 For one time as I was at the entrance cf my cave, there hap- 
 pened fuch : a dreadful earthquake, that not only the roof of 
 the cave came tumbling about my ears, but the pofts feemed 
 to crack terribly at the fame time. This put me in great 
 amazement; and running to the ladder, and getting over the 
 wall, I then plainly knew it was an eanhquaka; the place I 
 ftood on fufttiined three terrible ihocks in Ids than three 
 minutes-. But judge of my terror when I faw the top of a 
 great rock roll into the fea.l I then expe&ed the ifland would 
 be fw allowed up every moment : And what made the fcene 
 ftiil more dreadful, was to fee the fea thrown into the mcfl 
 violent agitations and difordersby this tremendous accident* 
 
 For my part I flood Ike a criminal at the place of execu- 
 tion, re^dy to expire. At the moving. of the earth, I. was*. 
 as it were, fea-fitk ; and very much afraid left the rock* 
 under which was my defence and habitation, ftiould over- 
 whelm it and myfelf in a iailing tomb. 
 
 When the third dreadful fhock had fpent itfelf, my fpirits 
 began to revive ; yet Hill I would not venture to afcend 
 I the ladder, but continued fating, not knowing what I (liould 
 do. So little grace had I then, as only to fay, Lord have 
 mercy upon me ! and no fooner was the earthquake over r 
 but that pathetic prayer left me. 
 
 It was not long after* when a horrible tempeft arofe, at 
 the fame time attended with a hurricane of wind. The fea 
 feemed mountains high, and the waves rolled fo impetuoufly, 
 that nothing could be perceived but froth and foam. Three 
 hours did this florm continue, and in fo violent a manner, a^ 
 to tear the very trees up by the roots, which was fucceeded 
 By abundance of rain. When the tempeft was over, I went 
 to my tent: but the rain -coming on in a furious manner, I 
 ! was obliged uke Shelter in the cave, where I was forced 
 to cut a channel through my fortification to let the water out. 
 It continued raining all that night, and foane time the noxt 
 day, Thefe accidents made me rrfolvc, as foon as the 
 
 B3 
 
 
 weather cleared up, to build me a little. hut In fome open 
 piace> walled round to defend me from wild creatures and 
 favages; not doubting but at the next earthquake, the 
 mountain would fall upon my habitation and me, and fwal- 
 low up all in its bowels. 
 
 April 16* — 20. Theft days I fpcnt 5n contriving how 
 and in what manner I mould fix my place o^abode. All 
 this while I was under the mod dreadful apprehenfions. —  
 When I looked round my habitation, every thing I found in 
 its proper place. I had feveral refolutions whether I mould 
 move or not; but at length refolved to (lay where I was till 
 1 found out a covenient place where I might pitch my tent. 
 
 April 22. When I began to put mv refclution in prac- 
 ( tice, I was ftcpt for want of tools and inilruments to work 
 with. Mod of my axes and hatchets were ufelefs, ccca- 
 fioned bv cutting the hard timber that grew on the ifland. 
 it took me up a full week to make my grindirone of ufe ta 
 me ; and at laft I found out a way to turn it about with my 
 foot, by help of awheel and a firing. 
 
 Aprf'l'28-, 29. Thefe days were fpent *n grinding my tools. 
 
 April SO. My bread fading fhort, I allowed rnyfelf but 
 onebifcuit a day. 
 
 May 1 . As 1 wa3ked alone: the fea-(hdre, I found a barrel 
 «f gunpowder, and feveral pieces of >he wreck, the Tea had 
 Hung up. Having fecured trofe, I made to the ihip, whofe 
 item was tore off, and warned a great diftance afhore ; but 
 the reft lay in the fands. This I fuppofed was occafioned 
 by the earthquake. I now refolved to keep my old pkce 
 of abode; and alfo to go to the fhip that day, but then 
 fou-nd it impoflible. 
 
 May 3. This day I went on board, and with my faw 
 fawed off one of the beams, which kept the quarter-deck, 
 I then cleared the fand till flood. 
 
 May 4. i caught fome fifh, but they were not wholefome. 
 The fame day I alfo catched a young doiphin. 
 
 May 5. This day I alfo repaired to the wreck, and fawed 
 another piece of timber, and when the flpod came, t made 
 a float of three great planks, which were driven afhore by 
 the tide, 
 
 May 6, 7, S, Q. Thefe days I brought off the iron bolts, 
 opened the deck with the iron crow, and carried two planks 
 to land, having made a way into the very middle of the 
 wreck. 
 
 
 May 1.0, II, 12, ]3, 14. All this time I fpent in bringing 
 off great quantities of iron and timber. 
 
 May 15. Took with me two hatchets on purpofe to cut 
 off fome lead from the roll, but all in vain ; for it lay too 
 low under water. 
 
 May 16- I omitted going to the wreck this day ; for em- 
 ploying myfelf to lock for pigeons, I outitayed my time. 
 
 May 17. I perceived kveral pieces of the wreck driven 
 a-fhore, which i found belonged to the head of the (hip. 
 
 May 24. To this day I worked on the wreck, and with 
 great .difficulty loofened fome things fo much with the crew, 
 that at the ftrft flowing tide, feveral calks floated "out, and 
 many of the feamen's chefts ; yet that day nothing came to 
 land but pieces of timber, and a hogihead which had fome 
 Brazil pork in it. 1 continued working to the 15th of June; 
 (except neceiTary time for food or re:*;) and, had I known 
 how to have built a boat, I had umber and planks enough : 
 I had alfo n-,-ar 100 weight -of lheet lead. 
 
 June 16". As I was wandering towards the fea-fide, I 
 found a large tortcife-or turtle, being th- -fir ft I had feen on 
 the liland ; though, as I afterwards found, they were many 
 on the other fide of it. 
 
 June 17. This day I fpent in cooking it, found in her 
 threescore eggs* ?.nd her fleih the moil favoury and pleafant 
 I ever tailed >n my life. 
 
 Ju e 18. I itaid within this .day, there being a continual 
 rain : and it was fomewhat more chilly and cold than ufual* 
 
 June W. Exceedingly bad, being taken with a trembling 
 and fhivering. 
 
 June 20. Awake all; nigh**,- my head racked with pain 
 and fever ifh. 
 
 Jan.. 2!. Sick unto death, and terrified with the cjifrv-al 
 apprehenfions of my condition. Prayed to God mere fre- 
 quently, but very cenfufedly. 
 
 June 22. Something better, but ft ill uneafy in my mind, 
 
 June 2'i. Again relapfed much as before. 
 
 June 2.4. Mended a fecond time. 
 
 June 25. A violent ague for feven hours*, cold and hot 
 fits fuccee ed with fairt (wests. 
 
 June 26. % Better, but very w*ak, yet I fcrarab'ed our, (hot 
 a (he- goat, brought it home and boiled fome of it ; I would 
 willingly have (tewed it, and made fome broth, but had no 
 pot.

 June 27. All this day I was afflicted with an ague ; 
 thirfiy, yet could not help myfelf to water: Prayed to God 
 tn thefe words: " Lord, in pity look upon me: Lord have 
 "mercy upon me: have mercy upon me !" After this I 
 fell afleep, which I found had much refaefhed me, when I 
 awaked. I fell fall afleep a fecond time, and fell into this 
 llrange and terrible fort of dream. 
 
 Methought 1 was fitting on the fame fpot of ground at the 
 outfide of the wall where I fat when the florin blew after 
 the earthquake; and that I faw a man defcending from a 
 great black cloud, and alight upon the ground. He was all 
 over as bright as a flaih of fire that a little before furrounded 
 him; his countenance inconceivably terrible; the earth, as 
 it were, trembled when he ilept upon the ground, and flames 
 cf fire feemed to 64) all the air. No fconer, I thought, he 
 iacded upon the earth, but with a long fpear, or other wea- 
 pon, he made towards me ; but furr, afcencing a riling 
 ground, his voice added to my amazement, when I thought 
 I heard him pronounce thefe dreadful words, "Unhappy 
 *' wretch! feeing all thefe things have not brought ihee to 
 *< repentance, thou (halt immediately die." In pronouncing 
 this dreadful fentenee, 1 thought he meant to kill me with 
 the fpear that was in his hand. 
 
 Any body may thirk it impoilibla for me to exprefs the 
 horrors of my mind at this vifion : and even when I awaked, 
 this very dream mad« a deep impreflion upon my mind. — 
 The little divine knowledge 1 had, I received from my fa- 
 ther's inftru&ions, and that was worn out fey an uninter- 
 rupted feries of fea-faring impiety for e«ght years fpace. Ex- 
 cept what ficknefs forced from me, I do not remember I had 
 one thought of lifting up my heart towards God, but rather, 
 had a certain fhipidity of foul, not having the leaft fenie or 
 fear of the Ornnipcteet Being when in difirefs, nor of gra- 
 titude to him for his deliverances. Nay, when X was on the 
 defperate expedition on the defert African fhore, I cannot 
 remember I had one thought of what would become of m<e, 
 cr to beg his confolation and afTiftance in my fufFerings and 
 diilrefs. When the Portugal captain took me up, and ho- 
 nourably ufed me, nay, farther, when 1 was even delivered 
 from drowning, by efcaping to this ifland, I never looked 
 *>r>on it as a judgment, but only faid J was an unfortunate 
 dog, and that's all. Indeed, fome fecret tranfports of foul I 
 had, which was sot through grace, but only a common flight 
 
 
 of joy, that I was yet alive, when my companions were all 
 drowned, and no other joy could I conceive bat whit is 
 common with the Tailors over a bowl of punch, after they 
 have efcaped the greateil dangers. 
 
 The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor conveni- 
 ences., might have called upon me for a. thankful acknow- 
 ledgment to Providence. Indeed the growth of my com 
 touched me with fome fenfe ; but that foon wore off again. 
 The terrible earthquake pointed to me, as it were, the fin- 
 ger of God, but my dreadful amazement continued no longer 
 than its duration. But now when my fpirits began to ii-nic 
 under the burden of -a ilrong diilemper, and I could leifureiy 
 view the miferies of death prefent themfeives before my 
 eyes, then my awakened conscience began to reproach me 
 with my pad life, in which I fo wickedly provoked the 
 juilice of God to pour down his vengeance upon me. 
 
 Such reflections as thefe opprefled me even in the violence 
 of diftemper. Some prayers I uttered, which only proceeded 
 from the fear of death. But %vhen I confidered my father's 
 advice and prophecy, I could not forbear weeping : for he 
 told me, <; That if I did perfift in my folly, I mould not only 
 ','. be deprived of God's bleffing, but have time enough to 
 " reflect upon my defpifing his inftru&ions,. and this in a 
 *' wretched time, when none could help me." And now 
 concluding it to be fulfilled, having no foul in the ifland to 
 adminifter any comfort to me, I prayed earneftly ta the 
 Lord, that he would help me in this my great calamity,— 
 And this, I think, was the firft time I prayed in fincerity for 
 'many years. But now I muft return to my journal. 
 
 June 23. Something refreihed with ileep, and the fit 
 quite off, I got up. My dream llili occafioned in me a great 
 confternation ; and, fearing that the ague might return the 
 fucceeding day, I concluded it time to get fomething to com- 
 fort me, I filled a cafe-bottle with water, and fet it within 
 reach of my bed ; and, to make it more nourifhing and iefs 
 chiHy, I put fome rum in it. The next thing I did was to 
 broil me a piece of goat's fleih, of which I ate bzx little ; I 
 was very weak; however, walked about, dreading the return 
 of my diftemper; and at night I Tupped on thiee of the 
 turtle's *%g*> which X roafted and ate, begging God's bleC- 
 fing therewith. 
 
 After I had eaten, I attempted to walk again out of doors 
 with my gnu ) but was fo weak, that I fat down, and look- 
 
 
 ed at the fea, which was fmoctb and calm. While I con- 
 tinued here, thefe thoughts came into my mind : 
 
 In what manner is the production of the earth and fea, of 
 which I have feen fo much? From whence came myfelf, 
 and all other creatures living, and of what are they made ? 
 
 Our beings were affuredly created by fome almighty in- 
 vifible Power, who framed the earth, the fea, the air, and 
 all therein. But what is that Power.? 
 
 Certainly it mud follow that God ha« created it all; Yet, 
 f«id I, if God has made all this, he muft be the Ruler of 
 them all, and what is relating thereto ; for certainly the" 
 Power that makes, muft indifputably have a power to guide 
 and direct them. And if this be lo, '(as certainly it muft,) 
 nothing can happen without his knowledge and appoint- 
 1 ment. Then, furely, if nothing happens without God's ap- 
 pointment, certainly God has appointed thefe my fuffe rings 
 to_ befall me. And here i fixed my firm belief that it was 
 his will that it /hould be fo ; and then proceeded to inquire,, 
 why fhould Gc'd deal with me in this manner ? Or what 
 have I done thus to dtferve his indignation. 
 
 Here confeience flew in my face, reprehending me as & 
 blafphemer ; crying with a leud and piercing voice, "Un- 
 " worthy wretch! how dare ycu afk *vhat you have done ? 
 f< Look on your psll life, snd /ee what you have left undore! 
 ** Afiz thyielf, why thou wert rot long ago in the mercilefs 
 "hands of death? Why not drowned in Yarmouth roads,. 
 u or killed in the fight, when ? the fhip "was r ake.h .by the 
 " Salee man of war? V/h-y not entombed in the bowels of 
 " wild beafts on the Afncan coaft, or drowned here when 
 **"'all thy companions fuifered. ihip wreck in the ocean ? 7> 
 
 Struck dumb with thefe reflections, I role up in a peri- 
 five, manner, being fo thoughtful that I could not go to 
 fleep ; and fearing the dreadful return of my diftemper, it 
 caufed rre to, remember, that the Brazilians ufe tobacco "fc.fe 
 aknoft all difeates. I then went to my cheft in order to- 
 find forne, where Heaven, no doubt, direcTed me to find a 
 cure for both foul and body; for here I found one of the 
 Bibles, which, till this time, I had neitner leilure nor inclir 
 nation to look into. 1 took both the tobacco anu that out of 
 the cheft, and laid them on the table. Several experiments 
 did I try with the tobacco: Firil, 1 took a. piece of leaf, and 
 chewed it; but it being very green and ftrong, almofl 
 ilupified me. Next I fteeped it in fame rum an hour or 
 
 
 two, revolving when I went to bed to take a dofe of it ; 
 and, in the third place, I burnt (ome over a pan of fire, 
 holding my nofe over it as long as I cculd endure it with- 
 out fuffbcation. 
 
 In the intervals of this bperation, though my head was 
 giddy and difturbed by the tobacco, I took up the Bible to 
 read. No (boner did I open it, but there appeared to me 
 thefe words, " Ca^l on me in the day of trouble, and I will 
 M deliver thee, and thru (halt glorify me. 
 
 At fir ft, this fentence made a very deep impreiTion on 
 my heart, but it Ocn wore off again, when I confidered the 
 vvcrd deliver was foreign to me. And as the children of 
 Jfrael fa*'d, when they were promifed He (h to eat, *< Can 
 God fpread a table in the wi'dernefs r" In like manner I 
 began to fay, c; Can God himfelf deliver me from this defo- 
 late iiland r" However, the words would (till return to my 
 mind, and afterwards made a greater impreffion up n me. 
 As it was r>ow very late, and the tobacco had dozed my 
 head, I was inclined to flecp; but before I woold lie down 
 I- fell an my knees, and implored the prornife that God had 
 made me in the Holy Scripture, that "if I called upon bim 
 in the day of trouble, he would deliver me." With much 
 difficulty, I afterwards drank the rum, whereia I had fteeped 
 the tobacco, which flying into my head, threw me intofuch 
 a profound fleep, that it was three o'clock rhe next day before 
 I awaked; or rather I believe, I flept two days, having cer- 
 tainly left a day in my account, and I could never teil any 
 other way. When I got up, my fpirits were lively and 
 cheerful ; my ftomach much better, being very hungry ; 
 and, in fh'orr, no fit returned the aext day, which was the 
 29th, but I found myfelf much altered- for the better. 
 
 The 30th I went abroad with my gun, but not far, and 
 killed a fea-fowl or two, refex-bling a bra^d goofe, which, 
 however, I cared not to eat when I brought them home, 
 but dined en two more of the turtle's eggs. In the evening 
 I renewed my medicine, excepting tnat I did not take lo 
 large a quantity, r. either did I chew the leaf, or hold my 
 head over the fmoke : but the next day, which was the 1ft" 
 of July, having a little retirn of the cold lit, I again took 
 my medicine as I did the-firft t me. 
 
 July 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak. In this 
 condition, I often thought of thtfe words, ** I will deliver 
 lheej" and while, at fosr/e times, I would think of the ihi- 
 
 
 poffibility of it, other thoughts would reprehencf me for dif- ' 
 regarding the deliverances I had received even from the 
 rnoft forlorn and diftrelfed condition. I alked myfelf, what 
 regard have I had to God for his abundant mercies ? Have 
 I done my part ? «' He has delivered me, but I have not 
 glorified him:" — as if I had faid, I had not owned and 
 been thankful for thefe as deliverances, and how could I 
 expect greater ? So much did this fenfibiy touch my hearty 
 that I gave God thanks for my recovery from licknefs ia 
 the moil humble probation. 
 
 July 4. This morning I began ferioufly to ponder on what 
 is written in the New Teilament, refolvlng to read a chap- 
 ter every morning and night as long as my thoughts would 
 engage me. As foon as I fet about this work ferioufly, I 
 found my heart deeply affected with the impiety of my pad 
 life; thefe words that I thought were fpoken to me in my 
 dream, revived, < & All thefe ihings have not brought thee to 
 ** repentance. " After this, I begged of God to afllft n^e 
 with his Holy Spirit ia returning to my duty. One day, in 
 perufing the Scriptures, I came to thefe words, " Him hath 
 «* God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to fife repentance 
 *j and to give reoniFion :" immediately I laid down the 
 book, and with uplifted hands to Heaven, loudly cried, " O 
 blefied Je.fus, thou fon of David, -Jefus thou exalted Prince 
 and Saviour, give me repentance !" And now indeed I prayed 
 with a true fenfe of my condition, and a more certain hope, 
 founded on the werd of God. Now I had a different fenfe 
 of thefe words, " Call on me and 1 will deliver thee," that 
 is, from the dreadful load of guilt which opprefied my iinful 
 foul, and not from a foliury life, which might rather be 
 called a bleffing, feeing I ^wanted neither food nor rai- 
 ment, when compared with living among the human race, 
 furrou nded. with to roach oppreflion, mifery, and affliction t 
 In a word, 1 came to this conclusion, that a deliverance 
 from fin was a much greater bleffing than a deliverance 
 from affliction. But again I proceed to ray journal. 
 
 To the 14th of July, I walked about with my gun, little 
 find Jittle at a time, having been reduced to the greateft 
 extremity of weaknefs. The applications and experiment! 
 1 ufed, were perfectly new : neither could I recommend ' 
 them to any one's practice. For, though it carried off the 
 fit, it very much weakened me, and I had frequent convul- 
 fions in my nerves and limbs for feme time.-. From this, I 
 
 
 learned, tnat going abroad in rainy weather, efpecla'ly when 
 it was attended with ftorms and hurricanes of wind, was 
 moft pernicious to health. I had now been about ten 
 months in the iflard ; and, as I never had (eta any of the 
 feuman kind, I therefore accounted myfelf as fole monarch ; 
 and as I grew better, having fecured my habitation to my 
 mind, I refolved to make a ccur round my kingdom, in or- 
 der to make new difcoveries. 
 
 The 1 5th of July, 1 began my journey ; I iirft went to 
 the creek, where I had brought my rafts on ihore ; and, tra- 
 velling farther, found that the tide went no higher than two 
 miles up, where there was a little brook of running water, 
 on the banks of which were many pleafant favannahs or 
 meadows, plain, fmooth, and covered with grafs. On the 
 lifing parts, where I fuppofed the water did not reach, I 
 perceived a great deal of tobacco growing to a very ftrong 
 ftalk. Several other plants I likewife found, _the virtues of 
 which I did not underftand. I fearched a long time for the 
 CafTava root, which I knew the Indians in that climate 
 made their bread of, but ail in vtin. There were ft verat 
 plants of aloes, though at that time Y knew not what they 
 were ; like wife i faw feveral fugar canes, but imperfect for 
 want of cultivation. With thefe few difcoveries, I came 
 back ihat night, and flept contentedly in my little caftle. 
 
 The next day, being the 16th, going the feme way, but 
 farther than the day before, I found the country more adorned 
 with woods and trees. Here I perceived dirierent fruits in 
 great abundance. Melons in plenty lay on the ground, and 
 cinders of grapes, ripe and very rich, fpread over the treei. 
 You may imagine 1 was glad of the difcovery, yet ate very 
 sparingly, Jeit I fhouid throw myfelf into a flux or feves. . 
 The grapes I found of excellent ufe ; for when I had dried 
 them in the fun, which preferved them as dried raiiins are 
 kept, they proved very wholefome and nourim-iag> and 
 ferved me in thefe feafons when no grapes were to be had. 
 
 The night drawing on apace, I afceoded up a tree, and 
 flept very comfortably, though it was the Iirft time I had 
 lain put of my hab tation. And when the morning came, I 
 proceeded with great plea fu re on my way, travelling about 
 four miles, as 1 imagined, by the length of the valley, di- 
 recting my courfe northward, there being a ridge of hills on 
 the fouth and north fide of me. At the end of this valley * 
 I came to an opening, where the country feerued to defcend 
 
 
 to the well ; th*re I found a Irttle fpring of frefh water, 
 proceeding out of the iide of the hill, with its cryftal dreams 
 running dire^ly eafL And, indeed, here my fenfes were 
 charmed with the moll beautiful landfcape Nature could af- 
 ford; for the country appeared frourifhing, green, and de- 
 lightful ; that to me it feemed tike a planted garden. I then 
 defcended on the fjde of that delicious vale, when L found 
 abundance of cocoa, crang?, lemon, and citron tre-^s, but 
 very wild and barren at that timr. As for the limes, they 
 were delight Tula nd wholefome, thejuiceof which I afcer-vards 
 ufed to mix in water, which made it very cooling and re- 
 freshing. And now 1 was refolved to carry home and lay 
 up a More of grapes, limes, and lemons-, again ft the approach- 
 ing wet feafon. So laying them up in feveral parcels, and 
 then taking a few of each wth me, I returned to my little 
 caille, after having (pent three days i\ this jou ney. Before 
 I got home, the grapes were fo bruifed that they were 
 ut erly fpoiled ; the limes* indeed, were good y but of thofe 
 I could bring only a few. 
 
 July 19. Having prepared two bags, I returned thither 
 again, but, to my great furprife, found all the grapes fpread 
 about, trod to peces, and abundance eaten, which made me 
 conclude there were wld beafts thereabouts. To prevent 
 this happening again, I gathered a large quantity of the 
 grapes, and hung them upon the out-branches of the tree, 
 both to keep them unhurt,, and that they might cure *nd dry 
 in the fun : and having well loaded myfelf with limes and 
 lemons, I returned once more to my old place of refi- 
 dence. 
 
 And now contemplating on the fruitfulnefs of this valley, 
 arfti pleafartnefs of its fnuation, its fecuriy from llorms, 
 and the deligMfalnefs of the adjacent woods, 1 concluded 
 I was fettled in the word part of the country, and there- 
 fore was thinking to remove my habitation. 
 
 But when I conlldered again, that, though it was pleafant, 
 it was off from the fea-fide, where there was a pofiibiiity, 
 fome time or other, a fhip might either be driven or fail by ; 
 and, that toinclofe myfelf among hills and woods, rnuft cer- 
 tainly put an end to my hopes of deliverance; I refolved 
 to let my caflle remain where Providence had firfl affigned 
 it. Yet fo ravifhed was I with this place, that I made me 
 a little kind of bower, furrounding it with a double hedge, 
 as high as I could reach, well Staked and filled with bull- 
 
 
 jfnes : and having fpent a great part of the month of July 
 I think it was the firft of Auguit before I begaft to enjoy 
 my labour. 
 
 Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry, I took them from 
 the trees, and they proved excellent good raiims of the fun: 
 the moil of which J carried to my cave; and happy for me 
 I did Co; by which I faved the beft part of my winter food. 
 
 Aug, 14. This day it began to rain ; and though I had 
 made me a tent like the ether, ytt having no (belter, of a hill 
 to keep me from ftorms, nor. a cave behind me to retreat to, 
 I was obliged to return to my old cadle. The rain con- 
 tinued more or iefs every day, till the middle of October ; 
 and fornetimes fo violent, that I could not ilir out of my 
 cave for feveral days. This feafon I found my family to 
 increafe J for one of my cats that ran away from me, and 
 which. I thought had been dead, returned about Auguit, 
 with three kittens at her heels, like herTelf, which I thought 
 ftrange, "becaufe both my cats were females, and the wild 
 cats of the ifland teemed to be of a different kind from our 
 European cats ; but from thefe cats proceeded fuch num- 
 bers, that 1 was forced to kill and deftroy them as I would 
 do wild beads and vermine. 
 
 To the 20th of this month, I could not ftir out, it raining 
 inccffantly ; when beginning to want food, I was compelled 
 to venture twice; the fini of which I (hot a goat, and af* 
 terwards found a very large tortoTe. The manner of my 
 regulating my food was thus: a bunch of raifms ferved me 
 for »ny breakfafl, a piece of goats fle.'h, cr turtle,, boiled, for 
 my dinner, and <wo or three turtle's eggs for my fupper. 
 While the rain lafted, i daily wcrked two or three hours at 
 enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on toward^ 
 one fide, till I came to the outftde of the hill, and made a 
 door or way cut, which came beyond my fence or wall, and 
 To I came in and oui this way. But after I had done this, I 
 was troubled to fee myfeif thus expofed ; though I could 
 not perceive any thing to fear, a goat being tne biggetfc 
 creature I had feen upon this iflind. 
 
 Sept. 30. Calling up my notches on my poft, which 
 amounted to 365, I concluded this to be the annivtrfary of 
 my landing ; and, therefore, humbly prqftrating myfeif on 
 the ground, cenfefling my fin^>, acknowledging God's 
 righteous judgments upon me, and praying to Jefus Chrill 
 to have mercy upon me, I tailed for twelve hours till the 
 
 
 going 'down of the Tun; and then eating- a bifcuit and ft 
 bunch of grapes, laid me on the bed, and with great comfort 
 took my night's repofe. Till this time, I never had diftin- 
 guilhed the Sabbath-day : but now I made a longer notch 
 than ordinary for the days of reit, and divided the week as 
 well as I could, though 1 found I had loft a day or two in 
 my account. My ink failing tfoon after, I omitted in my 
 daily memorandum things of an indifferent nature, and con- 
 tented myfelf to write down only the mod remarkable events 
 of my life. The rainy and dry feafons appeared now regular 
 to me, and experience taught me how to provide for them ^ 
 yet, in one thing I am going to relate, my experience very 
 much failed me. You may call to mind what I have men- 
 tioned of fome barley and rice which I had faved, about 
 thirty ftalks of the former, and twenty of the latter ; and, at 
 that time, the fun being in its fouthern pofition, going from 
 me, together with the rains, made me conduce it a very 
 proper feafba to fow it. Accordingly I dug up a piece ofi* 
 grosnd with ray wooden fpade, and dividing it into two 
 parts, fowed about two-thirds of my feed, pteferving by 
 me about a handful of each. And hsppy it was I did fo; for 
 no rains falling,, it was choaked up, and never appeared 
 above the earth till the wet feafon came again ; and thea* 
 part of it grew as if it had been newly fown. 
 
 I was refolved dill to make another trial ; and feeking 
 for a moifter piece of ground near my bower, I there fowed 
 the reft of my ittd in February, a little before the vernal 
 equinox; which having the rainy months of March and 
 April to water it, yielded a noble crop, and fprang up very 
 plcafantiy. I had frill faved part of the feed, not daring to 
 venture .all; and by the time I found out the proper feafoas 
 to fow it in, and that I might expect every year two feed- 
 times and two harvefts, my itock amounted to above half a 
 peck of each fort of grain. 
 
 No (toner were the rains over, but the flakes whi£h T had 
 cut from the trees, fnot out like willows, the -fir ft year after 
 lopping their heads. I was ignorant of the tree I cot them 
 from: but they grew fo regularly beautiful, that they made 
 a moil lively appearance, and fo rlourifhed in thre^ years 
 time, that 1 refolved to cut more of them ; and thefe foon 
 growing, made a glorious fence, as afterwards 1 fhall oblerve. 
 
 And now 1 perceived (hat the feafons of the year might 
 generally be divided not into fummer and wmier, as in 
 Europe, but into wet and dry feafons, as in this manner:

 The wet feafon would continue longer or fhorter, as the 
 winds happened to blow. But having found the ill confe- 
 quences of be'ng abroad in the rain, I took care beforehand 
 to furnifh myfelf with provisions; and, during ths wet 
 months, fat within doors as much as p >fiib{e» At this time I 
 contrived to make many things that I wanted, though it coft 
 me much labour ami pains, before I could acccmplifh them. 
 The fir ft 1 tried was to make a bafket ; but all the twigs I 
 could get, proved fo brittle, that I could not then perform it. 
 It now proved of great advantage to me, that, when a boy, I 
 took a great delight at Handing at a bafket- maker's in the 
 fame town where my father lived, to view them at work ; 
 and like ether boys, curious to fee the manner of taeir 
 working thefe things, and very officious to affift, I perfectly 
 learned the method of it, and wanted nothing but the tools. 
 And, it coming into my mind, that the twigs of that tree of 
 which 1 made my flakes, might be as tough as a fallow- 
 willow or ofiers, growing in England, I refolved to make 
 an experiment, and went the next day to my country-feat, 
 and found fome fit for my turn ; and after cutting down a 
 quantity with my hatchet, I dried them in my pale, and, 
 when fit to work with, carried them to my cave, where I 
 employed myfelf in making ftvcral forts of bafkt ts, info- 
 much that I could put in whatfoevtr I pleafed. It is true, 
 they were not cleverly made, yet they ferved my turn upon 
 all cccafions. 
 
 
 But flHl I wanted two neceffary things. I had no cafk 
 to hold my liquor, except two runlets aimed full of rum, a 
 few bottles of an ordinary fize, and fomefquare cafe bottles ; 
 neither had I a pot to boil any thing in, only a large kettle 
 unfit to make broth, or Hew a bit of treat: 1 wanted like- 
 wife at the beginning of this dry feafon, a tobacco pipe; 
 but for this I afterwards found an expedient. 
 
 I kept myfelf employed in planting my fecond row of 
 flakes. But remembering that when f travelled up to the 
 brook, I had a mind to fee the whole ifland, I now refumed 
 my intention ; and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two bifcuit 
 cakes, a great bunch of ra^fins, with a larger quantity of 
 powder and fhot than ufual, I began my journey. Having 
 pafled the vale where my bower Hood, I came within view 
 of the fea, lying to the weft ; ' when it being a clear day, I 
 fairly deferred land, extending from the W. to the S. W. 
 about ten or fifteen leagues, as I concluded ; but could not 
 fay whether it was an ifland or a continent. Neither 
 . could I tell what this place might be ; only thought it was 
 part of America, and where I might have been in a mifer- 
 able condition, had I ladder?. Again, I corfidered, that if 
 this was the Spanifh coaft, certainly, one time or other, I 
 mould fee fome fhip pafs by; 2nd if it was not, then it 
 muft be the favage ceaft, between the Spanifh country and 
 Brazil, which abounds with cannibals or man-eaters. 
 
 As I proceeded foiward, 1 fourd this fide of the ifland 
 much more pleafant than mine ; the fields fragrant, adorred 
 with fweet flowers and verdant grafs, together with feveral 
 very fine woods. There were parrots in plenty, which 
 made me long for one to be my companion; but it was with 
 great difficulty I cculd knock one down with my flick; and 
 I kept him at home feme years before 1 could get him to 
 call me by my name. 
 
 In the low grounds, I found various forts of hares and 
 foxes, as 1 took them to be, but much different from thole 
 in Englatd. Several of thefe I killed, but never ate .them; 
 neither, indeed, had I any cccafion ; for ab urding with 
 goats,, pigeons, turtle, and grapes, 1 could defy Leaderihall 
 market to forxjfh me a bet-er table. In this journey, J did 
 not travel above two miles a day, Ltcsufe I took feveral - 
 turns and windings, to fee what diicoveries I cculd make, 
 returning weary tncugh to the pkee .where I defig,ned to 
 reft all night, which was either in a tree, cr in a place 
 
 
 1 -which I furrounded with flakes, that no wild creature might 
 1 iuddenly furprife me. When I came to the fea-fhore, I was 
 amazed to fee the fplendour of it. Its ftrand was covered 
 with friells of the moit beautiful fifh, and ccnftantly abound- 
 ing with innumerable turtles, and fowls of many kinds, 
 which I was ignorant of, except thcfe called penguins. I 
 might have mot as many as I pleafed, but was fparing of 
 my ammunition, rather chocfing to kill a fhe-gcat, which I 
 did with much difficulty, on account of the rlatnefs of the 
 country. 
 
 Now though this journey produced me the moft pleafing 
 fatisfaction, yet my habitation was fo much to my liking, 
 that I did not repine at my beirg feated on the woril part 
 of the ifland. I continued my journey, travelling about 
 twelve miles further towards the ealt, where I fet a great 
 pile on the more for a mark, concluding that my next jour- 
 ney mould bring me to the other fide of the id and, eaft from 
 my caftle, and fo round till I came to my poll: again. As I 
 had a conftant view of the country, I thought I could not 
 mifs my way; but fcarcely had I travelled three miles,- 
 when I defcended into a very large valley, fo furrounded 
 with hills, covered with wood, that I having no guide but 
 the fun, nor even that, unlefs 1 knew well his pofition at 
 that time or the day ; and, to add to my misfortune, the wea- 
 ther proving very hazy, 1 was obliged to return to my poft 
 by the fea -fide, and fo backwards the fame way I came. — 
 In this journey my dog furprifed a kid, and would have 
 killed it, had I not prevented him. As I had cften been 
 thinking of getting a kid or two, and fo raifing a breed of 
 tame goats to fupply me after my ammunition was fpent, I 
 took this opportunity of beginning : and having made a 
 collar for this little creature, with a firing made of rope- 
 yarn, I brought it to my bower, and there incbfed and left, 
 him; and having fpent a month in this journey, at length 
 1 returned to my own habitation. 
 
 Nobody can doubt of my latisfactian, when I returned to 
 my little caitle, and repofed myfelf in my hammock. After 
 my journey, I reJled myfelf a week, which time I employed 
 in making a cage for my pretty Poll. I now began to 
 confider my poor kid J had left in the bovver, and I imme- 
 diately went to fetch it home. When I carne there, I found 
 the young creature almoft ftarved ; I gave it fome food, and 
 » tied it as before : but there wag no occasion, for it followed 
 
 
 me like a dog; and, as I conftantly fed it? it became Co 
 Joving, gentle, and fond, that it commenced one of my do 
 »e#ics, and would never leave me. 
 
 The rainy feafon of the autumnal equinox being wow 
 come, I kept the 30th of September in the moft folemn 
 manner, as ufual ; it being the third year of my abode in 
 the ifland. I fpent the whole day in acknowledging God's 
 mercies, in giving him thanks for making this folitary life as 
 agreeable and lefs fir.ful, than that of human fociety ; and 
 for the communications of his grace to my foul, infupport- 
 ing, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his 
 Pre violence, and hope for his eternal pretence in the world 
 to come. 
 
 Indeed, 1 often did confider how much more happy I was 
 in this (late of life, than in that accurfed manner of living I 
 formerly ufed; and fometimes when hunting, or viewing 
 the country, the anguifh of my foul would break out upon 
 me, and my very heart would fink within me, to think of the 
 wcods, the mountains, the deferts I was in ; and how I was 
 a prisoner locked up within the eternal bars and bolts of the 
 ocean, in an uninhabited wildernefs, without hopes, and 
 without redemption. In this condition I would often wring 
 my hands and wtep like a child : And even fometimes, in 
 the middle of my work, this fit wculd take me; and then I 
 would fit down and figh, looking on the ground for an hour 
 or two together, till fuch time as my grief got vent in a 
 flood. of tears. 
 
 One morning as I was fad ly employed in this manner, I 
 opened my Bible, when I immediately fixed my eyes upon 
 thefe words, "I will rever leave thee, nor fcrfake thee !" 
 Surely, thought I, thefe words are directed to me, or t\(e why 
 mould they appear juft at a momer t when I am bemoanieg 
 my forlorn condition; and if God does not forfake, what 
 ^matters it, fincehe can make me more happy in this it ate of 
 Jife, than if I enjoyed the greater!: fplendour in the world? 
 But while I was going to return God thanks for my prefect 
 ilate, fomething {eexntd to fhock my mind, as if it had thus 
 laid: Unworthy wretch, can you pretend to be thankful 
 for a condition from which ycu would piay to be delivered I 
 Here I flopt ; — and though I could not fay, I thanked the 
 Divine Majefty for being there, yet I gave God thanks for 
 placing to my view my former ccurie of life, and granting 
 me a true knowledge of repentance. AvA whenever i opened 
 
 
 or Art the Bible, I blefied kird P'ovidence, that directed 
 my good friend in England tofer d it among my goods with- 
 out any order, and for ailiittng me to fave ic from the power 
 of the raging ocean. 
 
 And now beginning my third year, rny federal daily em- 
 ployments were thefe : Firft, My duty to Heaven, and di- 
 ligently reading the Holy Scriptures ; which I rid t*ice or 
 thrice every day : Secondly, Seeking provinons with ray gun, 
 which commonly took me uj, when it did not rain, three 
 hours every morning : ' Ikirdh, The ordering, curing, pre- 
 serving and cooking what I killed, cr catched for my iap- 
 I ply, which took me up great part cf the day ; for, in the 
 middle of the day, the fun being in its height, it was fo hot, 
 that I could not ftir out ; fo that I had only but four hours 
 in the evening to work in : and then the wsnt of tools, ,of 
 afllitance, and fkill, wafted a great deal of time to little' 
 purpofe. I was no \eh than two and forty days making a 
 board .fit for a long flic If, which two fawyers, with their 
 tools and jaw-pit, would have cut cfF the fame tree in , 
 half a day. It was of a large tree, as rny board wa.-. to be 
 broad. I was three days in cutting it down, and two more 
 in lopping off the boughs, and reducing it to a piece of tim- 
 ber. This I hacked and hewed off each fide, till it became 
 light to move; and then I turned it, made one fide of it 
 fmooth and flat as a board frcm end 10 end, then turned it 
 downwards, cutting the other flde, till I brotgnt the plank 
 to be about three inches tfrck, ard fmooth on boh tides. 
 Anv body may judge my great labour, and fatigue in fuch a 
 piece of work ; but tnis 1 wtnt tnrough with patience, as 
 alfo many other things that my circumitaaces made necef- 
 iary for me co do. 
 
 The harvefl months November and December, were 
 now at hand, in which I had t: e pleafing pr~fpect of a very 
 good crop. But here I met with a tew nisfcrtune; for 
 the goats and hares, hating tailed of the Tweet nefs of the 
 blade, kept it fo Ihcrr, that it had not ftrer^th to ftv ot up 
 into a ftalk. To prevent this, I encioledlt with a hedge, 
 and by day iliot feme of its de\ ourers ; and my dog which I 
 had tied to the field ga:e, keeping baiking all right, Co 
 frightened th.fe creature?, that I got en.i.eiy rid of then*. 
 
 But no looner did I get rid of thefe, than ether enemies 
 appeared, to wit, whole flocks of fevcral forts of birds, who 
 only waiied jil} my Jaad; vy*s turned to xuin me. So ov-oks 
 
 C 
 
 
 did this provoke me, that I let fly, and killed three of the 
 malefactors ; ard afterwards ferved them as they do notori- 
 ous thieves in England, hung them up in chains,- as a terror 
 to others. And, indeed, fo good an effect, had this, that they 
 not only forfock the corn, but all that part of the ifland, To 
 iong as thefe criminals hung there. 
 
 My corn having ripened apace, the latter end of Decem- 
 ber, which was my lecond halved, I reaped it with" a fithe, 
 made of one of my. broad (words. I had no fatigue in cut- 
 ' ting down my. full crop, it. was To flender. The ears I car- 
 ried borne in a baiket, rubbing it with my hands, infteadof 
 thrafhing it; and when the harveft was over, found my 
 half peck of feed produced near two bufhels of rice and 
 two bufhels and a half of barley. And now I plainly fore- 
 faw, that, by God's gocdnefs, I mould be fumifhed with 
 bread ; but yet I was concerned, btcaufe I knew not how 
 to grind or make meal of my corn, or bread, neither knew 
 how to* bake it. I would not, however, tafte any of the 
 crop, but refolved to preferve it againft next feafon, and, 
 in the mean while, ufo my belt endeavours to provide my. 
 felf with bther food. 
 
 But where were my labours to end? The want of a 
 plough to turn up the earth, or (hovel to dig it, I conquered 
 by making me a wooden fpade/ The want of a harrow I 
 fupplied my felf with dragging over the corn a great bough 
 of a tree. Wfcen it was growing I was forced to fence it; 
 jvhen ripe to mow it, carry it home, ihrafh it, part it from 
 the chair, and lave it. And, after all, I wanted a mill to grind 
 itj fit've to dtefs it, yell and fait to make it into bread, and 
 an oven to bake it. This fet my brains to work to find 
 fome expedient for every one of thefe neceilaries againft the 
 inext harveft. ' 
 
 And now having more feed, my fir ft care was to prepare 
 me more land. I pitched upon two large flat pieces of 
 ground near m/ caiile, fcr that parpofe, in which I fowed 
 my feed, and fenced it with a gcod hedge. This took me 
 up three mosuhs : by which time the wet feafon coming on, 
 and the ran keeping me within doors, I found feverai oc- 
 caficns to employ myfeif ; and, while at work, u fed to di- 
 vert myfelf in talking to my parrot, learning him to know 
 and (peak his own name Polly the firft welcome word 1 ever 
 heard (poke jn the ifland. I had been a long time con- 
 triving how to make earthen vefTels, whicft 1 wanted ex- 
 
 
 trcmely, find when I conndered the heat of the climate, I did 
 not doubt but if I could find any.fuch clay, I might potch 
 up a pot, ftrong enough when dried in the fun, to bear 
 handling, and to hold any thing that *as dry, as corn, meal, 
 tnd other things. 
 
 To be foort, the clay I found ; but it would occaiion the 
 moll fericus perfon to fznile, to fee what awkward ways I 
 took, and what ugiy mifhapen things I made; how many 
 either fell out or cracked by tne violent heat of the fun, and 
 fell in pieces when they were removed : fo that I think it' 
 was two months time before I could perfect any thing; arid 
 even then but two clumfy things in imitation of earthen jarc. 
 Thefe, however, I very gendy placed in wicker bafkeu, 
 made on purpofe for them, and be ween the pot and the 
 bafkets, fluffed it full of rice and birley-ltraw, and thefe f 
 prefumed would hold my dried corn, and perhaps the meal 
 when the corn was bruifed. As for the imalier things, I 
 made them with better fuccefs ; fuch as little round pocs, 
 flat diPaes, pitciiers and pipkins, the fun baking them very- 
 hard. 
 
 Yet Hill I wanted one thing" abfolutely necefTary, and that 
 was an earthen pot, not only to hold my liquid, but alfo to 
 bear the fire, which none of thefe could do. It once hap- 
 pened, that as I was putting cut my fire, I found therein a 
 broken pirceof c ne of my veffels burnt as hard as rock> and 
 red as a tile. Tnis made me think of burning fome pots; 
 and having no notion of a kiln, or of glazing them with lead-, 
 1 fixed tnree \zr±e pipkins, ard two or three pots in a pile 
 one upon ano:her. The fire I piled round the outiide, and 
 dry wood on the top, till I faw the pots in the kfide red 
 hot, and founo tnat they were not cricked at all : and when 
 I perceived them perfectly red, I Jet one ofthern Hand in 
 the fire about five or fix hours, till the clay melted by the ex- 
 tremity of the heat, and would have r*n to giafs hqd i fuf- 
 fered it : upon which 1 fiackened myfire by degrees, till the 
 rednefs abater ; and watching them tni the morning, I found 
 I had three very good ppkins, and two earthen pets, as 
 well burnt ar.d fit lor my turn as I could defire. 
 
 No joy eculd be greaser than mine at this diicovery. For 
 after this, I may fa), I wanted for no fort of earthen-wa-e. 
 I filled one or my pipkins with water to boil me fome meat, 
 which it did adnvrably well, and with a piece of kid, 1 ma;;a 
 me fome good bro'.h, as well a? my circumiiar.ce* would 
 zftoiG mc at that time, 
 
 
 The next concern I had, was to get me a fione mortar to 
 beat feme corn in, inilead of a mill to grind it. Here* in- 
 deed, I was at a great lofs, as not being fit for a {lone-cutter; 
 and many days 1 fpent to find out a great ftone big enough 
 to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar, and ftrong enough 
 to bear the weight < f a petHe, a*d that would break the corn 
 without filling it with fard. But all the floues of the lfland 
 beingof a mourdering nature, rendered my fearch fuitieis; 
 and °then I refolved to look out for a great block of hard 
 wood, tthich having found, I formed it with my axe and 
 hammer, and trren, with infinite labour, made a hollow in tit 
 iuit as the Indians of Brazil make their canoes. When 1 
 had finifhed this, I made a great peftle of iron wood, and 
 then laid them up againft my fuccecdmg harveft. 
 
 My next bufinefe was to make me a fieve to fift my meal, 
 and part it fra«i the bran and hulk. Having no- fine thin 
 canvas to fearce the meal through, I could not tell what to 
 do. What linen 1 had was reduced to rags : 1 had goat s 
 hair enough, but neither took to work it, nor did 1 kno* 
 how to fpin it : At length I remembered I **(?** »«£ 
 cloths of calico tr muttin of the failors, when I had brought 
 out of the mip,and with deft I made three fmall fieves, 
 DroDer enough for the work. 
 
 P Tco4 not to confider the baking part. The want of 
 an oven I (applied by making fome earthen .paw very broad 
 Jtt notdeep? When I had t mind -to bake I made a great 
 fire upon the hearth, the tileso/ which I had m.de myfe f ; 
 and when the wood was burnt into lwe coa s, I Ipr-ad them 
 Ter it, till it became very hot : then (weeping Inem away, 
 ?Te down my loaves, and whelming down the- earthen pot* 
 tponTm, dJew the afhes »d«oal. all around the outtade. 
 Tthe pot t, continue the heat ; and in this manner 1 baked 
 Iv barley 'oaves, as well as if I had been a complete padry- 
 ^ok andalfomad^of the rice feveral cakes and p.ddn.s 
 
 
 folyed to fow as much at a time as would be fufficlent for 
 me for a whole year. 
 
 AH this while, the profpe& of land, which I had fen 
 from t^e ether fide ot t^he iflan-d, ran in my mind; 1 ftill 
 meditated a deliverance from this pbee, though the tear 
 of greater mi-fortunes might have deterred ire'frcm it. For, 
 el-owing that I had attained that phce, I ran the hazard cf 
 being killed znd eaten by the devouring cannibals ; and if 
 thry were not \o, \et I might be fl- in, as other European^ 
 had been, who fell irto their hands. Notwkhftandirg all 
 this, mv thoughts ran continually upon that lucre. 1 now 
 wifhed for my boy Jfury, aid the io^g boat with ihe moul- 
 der of rr.u tor. fail : I went ®n the fhip's boat that had been 
 call a great way on the more in the late ftprm. She was 
 removed but a Ir.tlej but her bott m being turned up by 
 the impetuofity and fury of the waves and wind, I fell to 
 work with all the Strength 1 had, wLh levers and rollers I 
 had cut from the wood, n turn h r, and repair the damages 
 fhe had fullainedr This work tcofc me up three or four 
 weeks, when Ending my little ftrtr.gth all in vain, 1 fell to 
 undermining it by digging away the fand, and fo to make 
 ic fall down, fetting pieces of wood tQ tbruit and guide it 
 in the fall. But after this was done, I was ftiil unable to 
 iUr it up, or to get under it, much lefs to move it forward 
 towards the wafer, and fo I was forced to give it over. 
 
 This difappoi: ten nt, however, did not frighten me. F 
 begsn to think whether it was nor poffible forme to make 
 a c*noe or perigua, fuch as the Indians make cf the trunk 
 of a tree. But here 1 lay under particular inconven'enc^s; 
 want cf tcols to make it, and want of hands to move it in- 
 trie water when it was made. However, urwerk I w^nt 
 upon it, flopping all the inquiries I ecu d make, with this 
 very (knple anfw'er I made to m>feif, Let's firft make it f 
 I'l warrant I'll find fome way or other to get it along when 
 it is done. 
 
 I riril cut down a cedar-tre?. which was five feet ten 
 inches diameter at the lower part next the flump, and four 
 feet eleven inches diameter at the end ot l«eniy~t&Q feet, 
 after which it leaned for a fpace, and then parted into 
 brat che:. Twerty days was i a hacking and hewing this 
 tree at the bottom, fourteen more in cutting off the branches 
 and limbfyand a whole month in fhaping it like the bottom 
 of a boat. As for the in fide, I was three weeks with a 
 
 C 3 
 
 
 mallet sod chiiTel, clearing it in fuch a manner, as that it 
 was big enough to -carry twenty-fix men, much bigger than 
 any canoe I ever (aw in my life, and confequentiy fuflkient 
 to tranfport me and ail my effects to that wimed-for fhoxc 
 I fa ardently defired. 
 
 Nothing remained now, but, indeed, the greateft diffi- 
 culty to.. get it into the water, it lying about one hundred 
 yards 'from it. To. remedy the firft inconvenience, which 
 was a riling hill between the boat and the creek, with won- 
 derful pains and iabours I dug into the bowels of the earth, 
 and made a declivity. But when this was dene, all the 
 irrength I had was as inefficient to remove it, as it was. when 
 I attempted to remove the boat. I then proceeded to meafurfc 
 the difknee of ground, refoiving to make a canal in order 
 to bring the water to the canoe, fince I could not bring the 
 canoe to the water. But as this feemed to be impracticable 
 to myfei*f alone, under the fpace of eleven or twelve years, 
 h brought me into fome fort of confide ration ; fo that I 
 concluded this alfo to be impofli'jle, and the attempt alto- 
 gether-Tain. J now faw, an.3 not before, what ftupidity it 
 is to begin work before we reckon its coll, or judge rightly 
 our own abilities to go through with its performance. 
 
 In the height of this work my fourth year expired, from 
 the 'time I was caft on this ifland. At this time I did not 
 forget my anniverfary ; but kept it with rather greater de- 
 votion than before. For now my hopes being fruilrated, I 
 looked upon this world as a thing I had nothing, to do with ; 
 and very well might I fay, as father Abraham faid unto Dives, 
 ''.Between thee and me there is a guiph fixed." And in- 
 deed I was feparated from its wicked nefs too, having nei- 
 ther the loft of the flefh, the luft of the eye, nor the pride 
 of life; I had nothing to covet, being lord, king, and em- 
 peror over the whole country I had in'pofieflion, without 
 difpute and without control : 1 had loadings of corn, plenty 
 of turtles, timber in abundance, and grapes above meafure. 
 What was all the reft to ire ? The money I had lay by me 
 as defpicabie drofs, which I would freely have given for a 
 g'rofa of'ubacco pipe?, or a ha~d-mill to grind my corn; in 
 a wcrd, the mture and experience of thefe things dictated 
 "to me (his juft refl?&ion ; Tnat the good things of this world- 
 are no farther good to us, than they are for our ufe; «nd 
 that whatever we nv:y heap up to give to others, we can 
 tut enjoy es much as we ufe and no more. 
 
 
 Thcfe thoughts rendered my mind more eafy than ufual. 
 Every time I fat down to meat, I- did it with thankfumefs, 
 admiring the providential hand of God, who, in this wilder- 
 nefs, had fpread a table to me. A*.d now I confidered what 
 J enjoyed, rather than what I wanted • compared my prefent 
 condition with what I at firft exp c~kd~ it fno uld be : how 
 I fhould have done, if I had got nothing out of the ihip ; 
 that I muft have perilhed before I had caught fifli or turtles ; 
 cr lived, had I fjund them, like a mere lavage, by eating 
 them raw, and pulling them to piecvs with my claws ? like a 
 belli. 1 next compared my iluion to that which I deferr- 
 ed ; how undutiful I had been to my parents ; how deltitute* 
 of the fear of God : how vo'd of every thing that was good ; 
 and how ungrateful for thofe abundant mercies { had re- 
 ceived from Heaven, being fe$, as it were, by a miracle, 
 even as great as Elijah's being fed by ravens j and call on. 
 a place where there is no venomous creatures to poifon or 
 devour me; in fhirt, making Srad^ tender mercies matter 
 of great confolation, I relinqjtQied all fadneis, and gave 
 way to contentment. 
 
 As long a^> my ink continued, which with water I made 
 lad as long as I could, I ufed to minute do vn the days of efcfe 
 'month on whi^h any remarkable event happened. — And, 
 
 Firft, I obferved, that the fame day I forfook my parents 
 and friends, and rin away to Hull, in order to go to fea ; tire 
 feme day afterwards in the next year, i was taken and made 
 a fUve-by the Salee rovers. 
 
 That the very day I efcaped out of the wr^ck of the fhiV 
 in Yarmouth. roads, a year after, on the fame day, I made 
 my efcape from Saiee in my patron's fifning-boat. 
 
 And, on the 30th of September, being the day intlwvear 
 I was born on, on that d iy t-enty-fix years 'afcer, was I 
 miraculoufly faved, and call a ft) ore on this iflmd". - 
 
 The next thing that wafted after my ink, was the -bif- 
 cirits which I had brought out of the ftrp ; and tbojgh I al- 
 lowed myfelf but one cake a day for above a twelvemonth, 
 yet I was quite out of bread fjr near a year, before I goc 
 any corn of my own. 
 
 In the next place, my clothes began to decay, and my 
 linen had been gone long before. Ho vever, I had pre- 
 ferved about three dozen of the fai!ors r chequered ihircs, 
 which proved a great refremment to me, when the violent 
 beams of the fun would not fuffer me to bear any of the ie*-' 
 
 C4 
 
 
 men's heavy watch-cents ; which made me turn tailor, and 
 after a miferable botching manner, ccnvert them to jacket?. 
 To preserve mv hear!, I made me a cap of goat's (kin, with 
 the hair outwards to Ice/pout the rain ; which indeed ferved 
 me (o well, that afterwards I made me a waiftcoat and open- 
 kneed breeches of the fame : And then I contrived a 
 fort of an umbrella, covering it uith (kins, which not only 
 kept cat the heat of the fun, but rain alfo. Thus being eafy 
 2nd fettled in my mind, my chief haopinefs was toconverfe 
 with God, in mod heavenly and c mfortable ejaculations* 
 
 For live years after this 1 cannot fay any extraordinary 
 thing occurred to me. My chief employment was to cure 
 my r&'rfms, and plant my barey and r'xe, both of which I 
 had a year's prowfion beforehand. But though I was dif- 
 appoin:ed in my iiril canoe, I made it, a: in ermediate time.% 
 my bufinefs to make a fecond, of much inferior fize; arid it 
 was two years before I had finiuVd it. But as I perceived 
 tt would no wife anfwer my deii^n of jailing to the other 
 ihore, my thoughts were confined (o take a tour rou-^d the 
 ifl.and, to f e what further difcoverits I could make. To 
 this intent, after having moved her to the water, and tried 
 how (lie would f*il, I fitted up a little mad to my boat, and 
 made a fail of the (hip's fail that lay by me. I then made 
 Jockers or b^xes at thi? end of it, to put in necefTtries, pr?~ 
 virion, a-id anamuni ion, which would preferve them dry, 
 either from rain or the ("pray of the fea ; and in the infide 
 of the host, I cut rae a long hollow place to lay my gun in; 
 and to keep it dry, made a flag to hang over it. . My urn* 
 breda I fixed in a ftep in the (Km, like a mafr, to ke*p the 
 heat of the fun off me. And now refolving to fee the cir* 
 cumferefice of my little kingdom, 1 victualled my (hip for 
 the voyage, puttingtn twod<<zensof my barley-bread loaves, 
 an earthen pot full of parched rice, a little bottle of rum, 
 'half a goat, p wder and ihot, and two wa*ch coats. It was 
 the 6th of November, in the 6th year qf my reign, or capti- 
 vity, that I fet out in c his voyage; which was much longer 
 than I expected, being obi. ged to pat farther cut, by reafon 
 of the rocks that lay a great way in the fea. And indeed 
 fo much did tr.efe rockb furprife me, that I was for putting 
 back, fearing that if 1 ven uted farther it &ould be out of 
 my po*er to return. In t^is uncertainty I came to an an- 
 chor juft on ihore, to which 1 wadrd with my gun on my 
 . ihoulder* and, snen climbing up a hill, whkh ove;look/;d 
 
 
 that point, I £aw the full extent of it, and (o refolved (o run 
 all hazards. 
 
 In this profpeft from the Kit, I perceived a violent cux- 
 re^t tunning to the eaft, coming very clcfe to the point; 
 which I ?4ie more. carefully obferved, thinking it dangerous, 
 and t. ; at when I came to it, I Right be drove into the lea 
 by its force, and not able to return to the ifland ; ar.d cer- 
 tainly it muit have b?en fo, had I not made this observation j 
 for on the other fide was the like current, with this <JifFer— 
 e^ce, rhat it fet off at a greater distance; and I perceived 
 there was a Prong, eddy under the land ; fo that my chief 
 bViirefs was t) work out of the firft current, and conveni- 
 ently get is to the eddy. Two days I ftaid here, the wind 
 blowing v^ry brifkiy E. S. E. which being contrary to* the 
 current, leaves a great. breach of the fea upon the' point ; > 
 fo it uas neither fit for me to keep too near the fhore, on 
 account of the breach ; nor fUnd at too near a diilance, for 
 ftar of the itreams. . That night' the wind abating, it grew 
 fo calm that I ventured out ; and here I may be a monu- 
 ment to ail rafh: and ignnrarit. pilotf ; for I was no fooner 
 come to the point, and. not above the boa;'* length from 
 fhoie, but I w*as got in'o deep water, with a current like 
 a mi!!, which drove my boat along fo violently, that it- was 
 imp ilible for me to keep near tne edge of it, -but- forced > 
 me more and mor^ out from the eddy to the It ft of me ; and - 
 alii cauid do with my paddles were ;ufe^efs, there bekg no-- 
 ivind to help me; 
 
 Now I- began, to look upoa rayfeff ?s quite In ft;- fince,' as 
 the current ran on both fides of the ifland, 1 was very cer- 
 tain they mult join again, and then I had no hopes but of 
 p.erifhing for., want in tne fea, af,er what proviiiors I bad 
 was fptn*> or before, if. a ilorm fhculd happen to ar.ie, 
 
 Who can ccir'etve the pre lent angu'ih of my mind at' 
 this calamity r With longing eyes did i look upcnjr.y littler 
 kingdom, and. thcu^ht ue ifland the .pleaia-tueft place in 
 the univejfe; Happy, thrice happy cL'ferfc, faid I, fbsii I 
 never fee thee more P WreUhed creature! whither am I 
 going f Why did I murmur at my lenefome condition,, when 
 now I would give the wh.de world to be thither -again, S 
 While 1 was thus complaining,.! found myfelf to bs drivrn 
 abo't two leagues into the fea ; however, 1 laboured tiU * 
 my frie-ngth was far fpent, to keep my boat aa far north as 
 pcifrbly 1 could,, to that fide of the current where ue eddy 
 
 Co 
 
 
 lay on. About noon I perceived a little breeze of wind 
 fpring up from the S. S. E. which overjoyed my heart ; and 
 was flill more elated, when in about half an hour, it blew a 
 
 fentlefinegde. Had any thick weather (prung up, I had 
 een loft another way ; for having no compafs on board, I 
 ihouid never have found the way to fleer towards the ifland, 
 if once it had difappeared ; bit it proving the contrary, I 
 fet up my mad again, fpread my fail, and flood away 
 northward as much as 1 could, to get rid of the current. And 
 no fooner did the boat begin to ftretch away, but I perceiv- 
 ed, by the ciearnefs of the wafer, a change of the current 
 was near; for, where it was ftrong, the water was foul i 
 and where it was clear the current abated. To the eaft/t 
 foon faw about half a mile* a breach of the fea upon fome 
 TOcks, which caused it again to feparate ; and as the main 
 farce of it drove away more foutherly, leaving the 
 rocks to the north- eaft; fo the other came back by the re- 
 pulfe of the rocks, making a fharp eddy, which returned 
 back again to the north-weft with a very fwift ftreamv 
 
 Thev who have experienced what it is to be reprieved 
 upon the ladder, or to be faved from thieves, juft going to 
 take away their lives, or fuch as have been in the like cala- 
 mities with my own, may guefs my prefent excefs of joy ; 
 how heartily I ran to my boat into the ftream of this eddy, and 
 how joyfuliy I (pre^d my fti'l to the refreshing wind, (land- 
 ing cheerfully before -it, with a fmart tide under foot. By 
 the affiitance of this eddy, I was carried above a leagoe 
 home again, when being in the wake of the ifland, betwixt 
 the two currents, I found the water to be in a fort of aftand. 
 About four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached within a 
 league of the ifland, and perceived the points of the rock, 
 whic.h caufed this difafter, ftretching out, as I obferved be- 
 fore, to the fouthward, which throwing ofFthe currents more 
 fouthwardiy, had occasioned another eddy to the north. But 
 having a fair brifk gale, I ftretched acrofs this eddy, and in 
 an hour came within a mile of the fhore, where I foon 
 landed to my unfpeakable comfort; and after an humble 
 proftratioT, thanking God for my deliverance, with refo- 
 lution to lay all thoughls of efcaping afide, I brought my 
 boat fafe to a l'ttle cove, and laid me down to take a wel- 
 come repefe. When I awoke, I was cor/fidering how I 
 might get my boat home ; and coafting along the fhore, I 
 came to a goad bay which ran up to a rivsdet cr brook, 
 
 
 where finding a fafe harbour, I flowed her an fafe as if (he 
 had been in a dry dock made on purpofe-for her. 
 
 I now perceived my k)t not far from the place, where be- 
 fore I had travelled on foot; fo taking nothing with me, 
 except my gun, and umbrella, I began my journey ; and in 
 the evening came to my bower, where I again laid me down 
 to reft. I had not flept long before I was awakened in 
 great furprife, by a ftrange voice that called me feverat 
 times, -" Robin, Robin, Robinion Crufoe, poor Robin ! 
 " Where are you, -Robin fon Crufoe? Where are you t 
 li Where have you been V 
 
 Sj fad was 1 afleep at fi-rft, that I did not awake thorough- 
 ly : but half afleep and half awake, I thought I dreamed 
 that fomebjdy fpoke to me. But, as the voice repeated 
 Robin/on Crufoe feveral times, being terribly affrighted, 
 I ftarted up in. the utmoft confufion; and no foon.er were 
 my eyes fully open, but I beheld my pretty Foil fitting on 
 theltop of the hedge, gfcnd foon knew that it was he that call- 
 ed me; for juil in fuch bewailing language I ufed to talk 
 and teach him ; which he fo exactly learned, that he would 
 fit upon my finger, and \s,y his bill clofe to my face, and 
 cry, u Poor Robinfon Crufoe, waere are you t where have 
 u you been I how came you here V y and fuch like pra'tle I 
 bad conftantly taught him. But even though I knew it to 
 be the parrot, it was a great while .before I could .adj-aU rny- 
 felf ; being amazed how the creatu-* got thither, and that 
 he (hould fix about that phce, and no where elfe. But 
 now being affured it could be no other than my honed 
 Foil, my wonder' ceafed, and reading out my .hand, and 
 calling familiarly. Poll, the creature came to me, and jjerch- 
 cd upon my thumb as he was won:, constantly prati ng to 
 me with <{ Poor Robinfon Crufoe, and how did I come herei 
 44 and where had I been t" as if the bird was overjoyed to 
 fee me ; and fo I took him home along with roe. 
 
 I was now pretty well cured of my rambling to fea ;. yet 
 1 could with my boat, which* had colt me fo muci\ trouble 
 and pains, on this fide the itland once more, but which .In- 
 deed was impracticable. I therefore began to^lead a v:ry 
 retired life,, living near a twelvemonth in a very coaten ei 
 manner, wanting for nathmg except con venation. As' to 
 mechanic labours, which my aecelfides obliged rne c >, I 
 fancied I could, upon occafioi, mace a.: tolerable cjir.p inter', 
 were the poor tools I had to work, with.il bat goqd/- 3s«

 fides, as I Improved in my earthen- ware, I contrived to 
 make them with a wheel, which 1 found much eafier and 
 better, m king my work mapely, -wh'ch before was rude 
 and ugly. But, I think, I was newr fo elated with my 
 own performance or prijec?, than for being able to make a 
 tobacco-p pe, which, though it proved an a vkward clumfy 
 thing, yet »t was very fcu^d, and cartied the fmoke per- 
 fectly we'll, to my great* fati ; fac!ian. 
 
 I alfo improved my wicker ware, making me abundance of 
 recefTary baftets, which, though not very handfom*, were 
 very bandy and convenient to fetch things- home irt, as alfo 
 for holding my Pores, barley, r ce, and ether provifions. 
 
 My powder beginning to fail, made me examine af er 
 what manner I fhould kiil tie goats cr birds to live on after 
 h was all gone* Upon which I contrived manv ways to 
 enfnare the gnats, and fee if 1 cculd catch them alive, parti- 
 cularly a fh~-goat wi:h young. At faft I had my defire ; 
 tor, making pitfalls and traps baited with barley and rice, I 
 found one rnoni r g, in one of rhem, an old he-goat, and in 
 the other, three kids, one male, the other two females. 
 
 So boirerous was the old one, that I could not bring him 
 sway. But I fo?got the x Id proverb, f « That hunger will 
 •' tame a lion;" for had I kept him three or four days with- 
 out provifions, ami \hen given him foms water, with a litt e 
 ccrn, he would have been a* tame as a young kid. The 
 other creatures I bov.nd with firings together: but I had 
 great difficulty before I -could bring them to my habitation, 
 jt was fume time befo/ethey would feed ; but throwing them 
 iweet ccrn, it fo much lemptc d them that they began to be 
 tsrner. From thence I concluded, that if I defigned to fur- 
 nifh myf If with goat's flefh, when my ammunition was 
 ipent, the tamely preying them up, like a flock of fheep, 
 ^bout my fettlernert, was the only method I could take. I 
 concluded, alio, I muft fep^rate the wild from the tame, or 
 etie they would always run wild as they grew up; and the 
 bell way ftt this, "was to have (cmc inclofe'd piece of ground 
 well fenced, either with a hedge or pale, to keep them fo 
 eflt&uaiiy, that thole within might n t break out, or thofe 
 without b*eak h'. Such an u> dertaking was very great for 
 one pair of hands ; but as there was an abfolute neceflity for 
 dicing it, my firft care was to find a convenient piece of 
 ground where there was likely to be herbage for them to eat, 
 «vater ;o dmk, asd cover to keep them irom the fun. 
 
 
 OF RORINSON CRUSOE. 61 
 
 Here again I gave another inflance of my ignorance and 
 inexper-ence, pitching upon a'piece of meadow land fo large, 
 that had I enclofed.it, the hedge or pale had been at leait 
 two miles about. Indeed, had ft been ten miles, I had 
 time enough to do it in ; but then I did not confider that my. 
 goats would be as wild in fo much compafs, as if ihzy had 
 had the whole iflard, and consequently as difficult for me 
 to catch them. This thought came into my head, after I 
 had carried it on, I bel'eye, about fif y yards; I therefore 
 altered my fcheme, and refolved to indole a piece of ground 
 about cne hunded and fiity yards in length, and one hun- 
 dred in breadth, fufficient erou^h for as many as wo jld main- 
 tain me, tiil fuch time as my flock increafed T and then I couli 
 add more ground. 1 new vigoroufly profecuted my work r 
 and it took me about three months in hedging the rlrft piece,, 
 in whxh tine I tethered the three kids in the beft part of 
 it, feeding them as near me as poflible, to make them fami- 
 liar; and indeed I very often would carry tome ears of bar- 
 ley, or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand ; by 
 which ihey grew fo tame, that when my enclofure was 
 finiihe^, and I had let them Jocfe, they would run after me 
 for a handiul of corn. This indeed anfwered my end ; and 
 in a year and a half's time, I had a flock of about twelve 
 goats, kids and all ; and in two years after, they amounted 
 to forty-three, r-cfides what i had taken and killed for my 
 fuftenancev After which I enclofed five fevcral pieces'of: 
 ground to fe^d them in, with pens to drive them into, that 
 I might takej them as I had cccaflon. 
 
 In this pr jec"t I Iikewife found additional blelSngs; for 
 J not only had plenty of goat's flefh, but milk too, which in 
 my beginning I did not fo much as >hink of. And, indeed^, 
 though I had never milked a cow, much lefs 5 a goat, or feen< 
 butter cr ch efe made, yet, after fome (flays and mifcar* 
 riiges, I made me both, and never af:erwards wanted. 
 
 How mercifully can the omnipotent Power comfort his 
 creatures, even in the midft of their greatest calamities ? 
 How can be fweettn the bitterefl provioences* and give us 
 reafon to magnify him in dungeons and prifons ! what a 
 bounttous table was here fpread in a wildemtls for me, 
 where I exp?cleci nothing at fir il but to perifh for hunger t 
 
 Certainly a Stoic would have fniiled to fee me at dinner. 
 There fat my royal majefiy, an abfokite prince and ruler 
 of in) kingdom, attended by ray dutiful fubjects, whom, iff 
 
 
 pleafed, I could either hang, draw, quarter, give* them 
 liberty, or take it away. When I dined, I feemed a king, 
 eating alone, none daring to prefume to do fo till I had 
 done. Pol!, as if he had been my principal court favourite 
 was the only perfon permitted to talk with me. My old, 
 but faithful dog, now grown exceedingly crazy, and who 
 had so fpecies to multiply his kind upon, continually fat on 
 my right-hand; while my two cats fat on each fide of the 
 table, expecling a bit from my hand, as a principal mark of 
 my royal favour. Thefe were not the cats I had brought 
 from the fliip;; they had been dead long before, and interred 
 near my habitation by my own hand. But one of them, as 
 I fuppofe, generating with a wild cat, a couple of their 
 young I had made tame ; the reft run wild into the woods, 
 and in time grew fo impudent as to return and plunder me 
 of my ftores, till fuch time as I fnot a great many, and thfr 
 reft left me without troubling me any more. la this plen- 
 tiful manner did T live, wanting for nothing but converfa- 
 ticn. One thing indeed concerned me, the want of my 
 boat; I knew rot which way to get her round the ifland 
 One time I rtMved to go along the more by land to her; 
 but had any one in England met with fuch a figure, it would 
 either have affrighted them, or made them burft: into 
 laughter ; nay, I could not but fmile to myfelf at my habit, 
 which I think in this place will be very proper to defcribe. 
 The cap I wore on my head, was great, high, and fhape- 
 lefs, made of a goal's (kin, with a flap or pent-houfe hang- 
 ing down behind, not only to keep die fun from me, but to 
 fhoot the rain off from running into my neck, nothing being 
 more pernicious than the rain falling upon the flefh in thefe 
 climates. I had a fhort jacket of goat's fkin, whofe hair 
 hung down fuch a lengthoa each fide, that it reached down 
 to, the calves of my legs. As for fhoes and ftockings, 1 had 
 none, buz made a femblance of fome thing, I know not what 
 to call them ; they were made like bufkins, and laced on 
 the fides like fpatcerdafhes, barbaroufly Ih aped like the- reit 
 of my habit. I had abroad belt of goat's (km dried, gi.rc 
 round me with a couple of thongs, inhVad of buckles; on. 
 each of which, to fupply the deficiency <>f fword and dag- 
 ger, hung my hatchet and fa w. I had another belt, not (o 
 broad, yet fattened in the fame manner, which hung over 
 my lhoulder,. and at the end of it, under tny left arm, h'j<\g 
 two pouches, made of goal's fkin, to hold my powder. anil 
 
 
 fliot. My bafket I carried on my back, and my gun on my 
 fhoulder ; and over my head a great clumfy ugly goat's 
 ikin unbrella, which however, next to my gun, was the 
 moft^necefTary thing about me. As for my face, the colour 
 was not fo fwarthy as the Mulattoes, as might" have been 
 expected from one who took fo little care of it> in a climate 
 within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. At one time 
 my be3rd grew fo long that it hung down about a quarter 
 of a yard; but as I had both razors and fciflbrs in itore, I 
 cut it all off, and fuffered none to grow, except a large pair 
 of Mahometan whifkers, the like of which I had feen wore 
 by fome Turks at Salee, not long enough indeed to hang a 
 hat upon, but of fuch a monftrous fize, as would have 
 amazed any in England to have feen. 
 
 But all this was of no confequence here, there being none 
 to obferve my behaviour or habit. And fo without fear 
 and without control, I proceeded on my journey, the profe- 
 xution of which took me up five or fix days. I hrtl travelled 
 along the fea-fhcre, diredly to the place where I ftrft brought 
 my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks ; but now hav- 
 ing no boat to take care of, I went overland a nearer way 
 to the farn; height that 1 was before upon ; when looking 
 forward to the point of the rock, which lay out, and which 
 I was forced to double with my boat, I was amazed to fee 
 the fea fo faiooth and quiet, there being no rippling motion, 
 nor curren% any more than in other places. This made rae 
 ponder fome time to guefs the reafon of it, when at laft I 
 was convinced that the ebbfetting from the weft and joining 
 with the current of water from fome great river on fhore, 
 mud be the occafion of thefe rapid flreams; and that, con- 
 fequently, as the winds blew more weflwardly or more 
 fouthwardly," (o the current came the nearer, or went the 
 farther from the inore. To fatisfy my cunoftty, I waited 
 there tUl evening, when the time of ebb being made, I 
 plainly perceived from the v rock the current again as before, 
 with this difference, that it ran farther off, near half a league 
 from the (bore, whereas, in my expedition, it fet clofe up- 
 on it, furioufly hurrying me and my canoe along with ii % 
 which at another time it would not have done. And now 
 I was convinced, that, by obferving the ebbing and flowing 
 of the tide, I might eafily bring my boat round the ifl.ind 
 again. But when I began to think of puitin*^ it in practice 
 the remembrance of the late danger flruck .me with fuch 
 
 
 horror, that I changed my refolution, and formed another, 
 which was more fafe, though more laborious; and this was 
 to make another canoe, and to have one for one fide of the 
 ifl^ncf, and one for the other. 
 
 I had- rowlwo plantations in the ifhnd; the firfl: my 
 little fortification, fort, or cattle, with many lar^e and fpa- 
 cious improvements ; for by this time 1 bad enlarged the cave 
 behind me witt feveral little caves, one within another, 
 to hold my bafkets, corn and fh aw. Th * piles with which 
 I made my wall, were grown (o lofty and great, as obfcured 
 my habitation. And near this commodious and pleafmt 
 iett'ement, lav my weH-cuHvated and improved corn-fields, 
 which kindly yielded me their fruit in the proper feaf n. 
 My fecond plantation was that near my country-feat, or 
 little bower, where my grapes flourifhed, and where, having 
 planted many ftakes, 1 made enclofures for my goats, fa 
 itrongly fortified by labour and time, thatit was much Wronger 
 than a wall, and cenfequentiy impoffible for them to break 
 through. As for my bower i felf, I kept it ccnitantly in 
 repair, and cut the' trees- in "fuch a manner, as made the?n 
 grow th ; ck and wild, and form a mod delightful (hade, In 
 the centre of ths, flood my tent, thus erected : I. had driven 
 four piles in the ground, fpreading over it. a piece of the 
 fhip's fail; beneath which I made a fort of a couch with the 
 fkins of the creatures I had fiain, and other things ; and 
 having laid thereon one of thefailor's blankets, which I had 
 faved from the wrrck of the (hip, and covering my felf with a 
 great watch-coat, J rook up this p'ace for my country retreat. 
 
 Very frequently from this fe tlement did I ufe to vifit 
 my boat, and keep her in very gcod order. And fornetirnei 
 J would venture in her a ca& or two from the tho.e, but 
 no farther, lift either a ftrong current, a fedden, itermy 
 wind, or fome unlucky accident fhould hurry me from the 
 ifland as before. But now X.enire&t .your attention* whiiii 
 I proceed to inform you of a new, but m-oft furpriiing, 
 fcene of Jjfe which here befel me. 
 
 Yoii may eafily fuppofe, that after having been here fo 
 long, ..nothing could be more amazing than to fee a humaa 
 creature. Or»e day it happened, that, going to my boat, 1 
 faw the print* of a man's naked foot oh the (bore, very evi- 
 dent on the fand, as the toes, heels, ard every part of it. — 
 Had I feen an apparition of the moil frightful fhape, 1 could 
 no: have been mere confounded. My willing cars gavs 
 
 
 the nricteft attention, I caft my eyes around, but could 
 fatisfy neither the one nor the other. I proceeded alter- 
 nately to every part of the (bore, but with equal effect ; 
 neither could I fee any ether mark, though ihe iand aboat 
 it was as fufceptible to take im predion, as that which was 
 fo plainly ftamped. Thus, (truck wi h confufion and hor- 
 ror, I returned to my habitation, frightened at every bufh 
 and tree, taking every thing for men; and p ffeftVd with 
 the wildeft ideas: That night my eyes never cl fed. I 
 formed nothing but the moll difmal imaginations, concluding 
 it muft be the mark of the devil's foot which I had (een. 
 For otherwife how could any mortal come to this illand? 
 where was the (hip that tranfpor ed them ? and what figns 
 of any other footiteps? Though thefe f emed very ihong 
 rcufons for fuch a fuppofition, yet (thought I) why fhould 
 the devil make the print of his foot Xo no purpofe, as I can 
 fee, when he might have taken other ways to have terrified 
 me? why mould he leave his mark on ths other fide of the 
 illand, and that too on the fands, where the furging waves 
 of the ocean might foon have erafcd the impreffion. Surely 
 this action is not ccnfiftent with the fubtlety of Satan, faid 
 I to myfelf; but rather mull be fome dangerous creature* 
 fome wild lavage of the main land over agrti'jft me, that, 
 venturing tco far in the ocean, has been driven here, either 
 by the violent currents or contrary winds; and not caring 
 to flay on this defolate ifland, has gone back to fea again. 
 
 Happy, indeed, faid I to myfelf, that none of the lavage 
 had feen me in that pface ; yet 1 was not altogether with- 
 out fear, left, having found my boat, trey fhould return i» 
 numbers and devour me, or at leati carry away all my corn 
 and deilroy my flock of tame ^oats. In a word, all my reli- 
 gious hopes vamfhed, as though I thought God wou'd not 
 now protect me by his power, who lud fo wonderfully pre- 
 ferved me fo long. 
 
 What various changes of Providence are there in the life 
 of man? How changeable are ocr affections, according to 
 different circumna-ces? We love to day, woa.c we nace 
 to-morrow; we thon or : e hour wiat we feek the next. 
 This was evident in me in the m ft coofp'cacus manner; 
 For I, who before had fo much lamented my condition, in 
 being banifhed fron all human kind, was now even ready 
 to expire, when 1 conndered that a man had fet his f oat oa 
 
 
 this defolate ifland. Bat when I red my (ration of 
 
 life, decreed by the infinitely wife od providence of 
 
 God, thait I ought' not to difpute my Creator's fovereignty, 
 who has an undoubted fight to govern and difpofe of his 
 creatures as be thinks convenient ; and that his jutlice and 
 mercy could either ponifh -or deliver me: I fay , when I' 
 co-nfidercd all this, I comfortably .found it my ddty to rruil 
 .fincerely in him, pray ardently to him, and humbly refign 
 myfelf to his divine will. 
 
 One morning lying on my bed, the fe words of the facred 
 writings came into my mind, u Call upon me in the day of 
 c< trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou fhalt glorify me." 
 Upon this fentence, rifing more cheerfully from my bed, I 
 offered up my prayers in the moil heavenly manner : and 
 when I had done, taking up my Bible to read, thefe words 
 appeared- firit in my fight:-— tc Wait on the Lord, arid be 
 ** of gcod cheer, and he mail ftrsngthen thy heart : Wait 
 c < I fay on the j^ord.' 5 Such divine comfort did this give 
 me, as to remeve all caufe of fadnefs upon that occafiom 
 
 Thus, after a wor 7 d of apprehensions and fears, for three 
 days and nights, 1 at ifr-ft ventured out of my caftle and 
 milked my goats, one of vvhich w'as almoft fpoiled for want 
 of it. I nexx (though in great fear) vi fixed my bower, and 
 milked my flocks there alio; when growing bolder, I went 
 down to the (bore again, and meafaring the print of the foot 
 to mine, to fee, perhaps, whether I myfelf had not occafion^ 
 ed that mark, .1 found it much fuperior in iargenefs ; and fo 
 returned home, nov abfolutely convinced that cither fome 
 men had been afhore, or that the ifland mu'l be inhabited, 
 and therefore that I might -Se furprifed before I was aware. 
 
 I now began to think of providing for my fecurity, and 
 refolved in my mind many different fcfiemes for that pur- 
 pofe. I fir ft propofed to cut down my inciofures, and turn 
 my tame cattle wild into the woods, that the enemy might 
 not find them, and frequent the ifland in hopes of killing 
 the fame. Secondly, I was for digging up my corn-fields 
 for the very fame reafon. And, laiily, I concluded to de- 
 moliih my bower, left, feeing a place of human contrivance, 
 they might come farther, and frid out, and attack me in my 
 little ca file. 
 
 Sach notions did the fear of danger fuggeft to me: and I 
 looked, I thought, like Ue unfortunate king Sail, wiien not 
 only oppreiled by the Poiliitines, but alfo forfaken by God 
 
 
 himfelf. And, it is ftrange, that a little before, having en- 
 tirely resigned myfelf to the will of God, I fhould nowllave 
 lutie confidence in him, fearing thofe more who could kill 
 this fadinp* body, than him who could deftroy my immortal 
 foul. 
 
 Sleep was an utter (hanger to ray eyes that night; yet 
 nature, fpert and tired, fubmitted to a filent repofe the next 
 morning, zna then joining reafon with fear, I confidered 
 tightfu! and pleafant illand might not be (o en- 
 tirely for&ken, as I might think; bat that the inhabitants 
 from the.other fhore might fail, either with a defign or From 
 neceffity, by crofs winds; and, if the latter circumitance, 
 I had reafon to belieye they would depart the firft oppor- 
 tunity. However, my fear made me think of a place for re- 
 treat upon an attack. I now repented that I had made my 
 door to come out beyond my fortification ; to remedy which 
 I refolved to make me a fecond one : I fell to work, there* 
 fore, and drove betwixt that double rows of trees, which I 
 planted above twelve years before, feveral ftrong piles, 
 thickening it with pieces of timber and old cables, and 
 lirengthsning the footer it with earth which [ dug out of my 
 cave ; I alfo made me feven holes, wherein 1 planted my 
 mufkets like cannon, fitting them into frames refembling 
 carriages. This being finished with indefatigable industry, 
 for a great way every where, I planted flicks of ofiers like a 
 wood, about twenty thoufand of them, leaving a large fpace 
 between ti>em and my wall, that I might have room to fee 
 an enemy, and that they might not be (heltered ir.ong the 
 young trees, if they offered to approach the outer wall. — 
 And, indeed, fcarce two years had paffed over my head, 
 when there appeared a lovely ftizdy grove, and in fix years 
 it became a thick wood, perfectly imp.iffib'e. For my fife- 
 ty, I left no avenue to go in or put ; initead of which I fet 
 two ladders, one to a part of a rock which was low, and 
 then broke in, leaving rooTi to place another ladder upov 
 tnat ; fo that when [ tookthefe down, ic was impollibie for 
 any man to defcend without hurting hirnfelf; and if they 
 had, they would iHU be at the outiide of my cuter wall. — 
 But while I took all thefe meafurei of human pru lence for 
 mvo>vn prefervation, t was not altogether unmindful of other 
 affurs. - To preferve roy Ctock of ta-me gaats, that the eas- 
 m/ fuouid not take all at once 3 I looked ou: for ifu moil 
 
 
 ret'red part of the ifland, which was the place where I had 
 loft myfeif before-mentioned, and there finding aclearpieca 
 of land, containing three acres, forrcunded with thick woods, 
 I wrought fo hard, that in Ids than a month's time, I fenced 
 it fo well roond, thai, my flocks were very well fecured in 
 it, and put therein two he-goats and len fhe-gcats. 
 
 All this labour was occafioned parely by fearful appre- 
 henfions, on account of feeing the print of a man's foot.— 
 And not contented yet win what I bad don*-, I feerched 
 for another place towards the weft point of the ifland, 
 where 1 might alfb retain another flock. Then wandering 
 on this errand more to the weft of the ifland than ever I had 
 yet done, and calling my eyes towards the fea, methougnt 
 I perceived a boat at a great dift3nce, but could not poffi- 
 bly tell what it was for want of my perfpeclive glafs. I 
 confidered then it was no flrange thing to fee the print of 
 a man's foot ; and concluding them cannibals, bletfed God 
 for being caft on the other fide of the ifland, where none of 
 the favages, as t thought, ever came. But when I came 
 down the hill to the fhore, which was the S. W. poirt of 
 the idand, I was foon confirmed in my opinion ; nor can 
 any one defcribe my horror- and amazement, when I faw 
 the ground fpread with fkulfs, hands, feet, and bones cf 
 human bodies ; and, particularly I perceived a fpace like 
 a circle, in the mid ft of which had been a fire, about which 
 ' I conjectured thefe wretches fat, and unnaturally faciificed 
 and devoured their fellow-creatures. 
 
 The horror and loaVnfomenefs of this dreadful fpectacle r 
 bo?h confounded my fenfes, and made me discharge from my 
 ftomach in an exceflive manner. I tfren retur ed towards 
 my habitation ; and, in my way thither, fhedding floods of 
 tears, and falling down on my bended knees, gave God 
 thanks for making my na'tirt contrary io thefe wretches, 
 and delivering me fo-long out of their hands. 
 
 Though reafo-v and my long refiuence here had offired 
 me, that thefe favages never came up io the thick woody 
 part of the country, and that I had no reaf n to be ap>re- 
 he-ifive of a dHco^ery ; yet fuch an abhorrence did I ftiil 
 retain, that, for two years after, I confined myfeif only to 
 mv three plantations; 1 mean my cattle, country-feat, ami 
 inclofure in the woods. And though in procefs of time my 
 dreadful apprehenlions began to wear away, yet my eye3 
 >&ei$ rnoie vigilant for fear of being furpnfed, and I was 
 
 
 very cautions of fi-ing my gun, left being heard by thofe 
 creatures, they mould proceed to attack me I refo.ved, 
 however, manfully to lofe my life if they d-d, and went 
 a-med with three piftols, ftuck to my girdle wnich, added 
 to the defcrip.ion I have given of my fell before, made me 
 look with a very formidable appearance- 
 
 Thus my circumftances for fome time remai-ed very 
 calm and undifturbed; and when I compared my co»dtWM 
 to others, I found it far fro™ bemg miferable. And indeed, 
 would all pe.fons compare their circumitarces, not with 
 thofe above them, bat with thofe innumerable unnappy ob- 
 jects beneath them, I am fure we fhould not hear thoie 
 dailv murmuring and cot gainings that are in t e world. 
 For'my part I wanted but few things InueeJ, the terror 
 which the favages had put me in, fpoiled fane inventions 
 for my own conveniences. One of my prcjecls was to brew 
 me fome beer; a very whimfical one indeed, when t is 
 corfidered that I had neither calks fiiffietent, nor could J. 
 make any to preferve it in; neither had I hops to nuke it 
 keep, yeft to make it work, nor a copper cr kettle to make 
 it boil. Perhaps, indeed, after fome years I might bring 
 this to bear, as I had done ether things. But now my inven- 
 tions were placed ano her way; and day and nignt I could 
 think of nothing but how Lnvght deltroy (ome of ihefe 
 cannibals, when proceeding to their bloody entertainments ; 
 and fo faving a victim from bei"g facrinced, that he might 
 after become my fer.vant. M,oy were my contr.vances 
 after this purpo'e, and as many more objections occurred, 
 alter I had hatched them. 1 once contrived to d;g a hole 
 under the place where they ma^e their fire, and put taerein 
 five or fix pounds of gunpowder, which would coniequently 
 blow up all thofe that were near it; and then I was ioatn to 
 fpend fo much upon them, left it ihould not do that certain 
 execution 1 could defire, ard but only affngnt and not kjll 
 diem. Having hid this defign afide, I again prope'ed to 
 myfelf to lie privately h ambufh, in fome convenient piace, 
 with my three guns double loaded, and let fly at them in 
 the mi/lt of the-r dreadful ceremonv : ad having killed 
 t*o or three of them at every toot, fail upon the reft fud- 
 denly with my three piftols, and not lee one mother i fen 
 efcape. This imagination p'eafed my fancy fo muc.i, that 
 I ufed to dream of it in the night time. To put my defign 
 
 
 in execution, I was not long in feeking for a place conve. 
 nient for my purpofe, where unfeen I might behold every 
 action oi the favages. Here I placed my two muikets, each 
 of which was loaded with a brace of flugs, and four or 
 five fmaller bullets about the fize of piftol bullets; the 
 fowling-piece was charged with near a handful of the iargeft 
 fwan ihof, and in every piilol was about four bullets. — " 
 And thus all things being prepared, no fconrr would the 
 welcome light fpread over the element, but, like a giant rc- 
 frtjhed with <wine T as the Sciiptuie has it, would I ifiue foilh 
 from my caftle, and from a lefty hill, three miles diftant, 
 view if I could fee any invaders approach unlawfully to 
 my kingdem. But having waited in vain two or three 
 months, it not only grew very tirefome to me, but brought 
 me to fome confideration, and made me examire mytelf, 
 what fight I had to kill thefe creatures in this manner. 
 
 If (argued I to myfelf) this unnatural cultom of their's be 
 a fin ofTenfive to Hea\ tn, it belongs to the Divine Being, 
 who alone has the v ndiclive power in his hands, to fhower 
 down his vengeance upon them. And, perhaps he does fo 
 in making them beccme one another's executioners. Or, 
 if not, if "Gcd thinks thefe doings ju ft, accoiding to the 
 knowledge they conceive; what authority have I to pretend 
 to thwart the decrees of Providence, which has permitted 
 thefe actions fcr fo many age?, perhaps from almoft the be- 
 ginning of the creation? They never ofTenced me, what 
 right have I then to concern msfeif in their medding one 
 another's blood? And, indeed, I have fince known, they 
 value no more to kill and devour a captive tatan in war, 
 than we do to kill an qx, or eat mutton. I then co. eluded 
 it neceffarily followed, that thefe people were no mere 
 murderers than Christians, who many times put whole troops 
 to the fwoid, after throwing down their arms. — Again, I 
 confidered that if I fell upon them, I ihould be as much in 
 the wrong as the Spaniards, who had cemmitted the great- 
 elt barbarities upon thefe people u ho had never offended 
 them in their whole lives ; as if the kingdom of Spain was 
 eminent for a race of men wiihout common companion to 
 the miserable, a principal iign of the mod generous temper: 
 theie confiderations made me paufe, and made me think I 
 had taken wrong meafuns in my refoiuiion: 1 now argued 
 with /i))lelf, it was be.ter for me never to attack, but to re- 
 gain undifcovered as k'ng as i pollibly could j that an op- 
 
 
 polite conduct wo^ i certainly prove deflructive; for as it 
 was feared y to be fappofed I could kiH tr;em all, I might 
 either be overpowered by the remaining, or that feme 
 efcaping, might bring thoufands to my certain dcftruSion. 
 And, indeed, reiigion took their part fo much as to convince 
 jne how contrary it was to my duty to be guiky of fhedding 
 human blood, innocem as to my particular, whatever they 
 are to one another; that I nad nothing to do with it, but 
 leave it to the God of all power and dominion, as I faid 
 before, to do therein what feemed convenient to his heavenly 
 wifdom. And, therefore, on my knees I thanked the Al- 
 mighty for delivering me from blood -guikinefs, and begged 
 his protection that I might never fall into their hands. 
 
 Thus giving over an attempt which I had rafhly begup, 
 I never afcended the hill on that occafion afterwards : I only 
 removed my beat, which lay on the other fide of the ifland, 
 and every thing that belonged to her, toward the ea(r, into 
 a little cove, that there might not be the leaft iiiadow cf any 
 boat near, or habitation upon the ifland. — My caille then 
 became my cell, keeping always retired in it, except when 
 3 went out to milk my fhc-gcau, and order my little flock in 
 the wood, which was quite out of danger : for fure I was 
 •that thefe favages never cam-e here with expectations \o 
 £nd any thing, and cenfequently never wandered from the 
 ccaft : however, as they migtit have been feveral times on 
 more, as well before as af;er my dreadful ?.ppr«h^nfions, I 
 looked back with horror to think in what ftatS I might have 
 been, had I fuddenly met them flenderiy armed, with one 
 gun only loaded wan fmall (hot ; and how great would 
 have been my amazement, if, inilead of one man's fo.oi, I 
 had perceived fifteen or twenty iavager, who Having once 
 ftt their eyes upon me 5 by the fw if me is cf their feet would 
 have left me no poliibility of efcaping? Thefe thoughts 
 would fink my very foul, fo that I would fall into a dfep 
 melancholy, till fuch time as the conlideration of my grati- 
 tude to the Divine Being moved it from my heart, j. then 
 fell into a contemplation of the fecret fpriogsof Providence, 
 and how won.lertuily we nre delivered, when rnienfible of 
 it; and wnen intricated in uncertain mazes or labyrinths of 
 doubt or hefitation, what fecret hints direct us in the right 
 way, when we intended to go out of it; nay, perhaps con- 
 trary to our bufinefs, fenfe, or inclination. Upon which I 
 fixed within me this as a certain rule, neve* to difobey thofe 
 
 
 fecret iropreSiors of the mind, to the acting or not acting 
 any thing that cfTered, for which I yet cou ? d afiign no rea* 
 Ton. But let it I e how it will, the advantage of this con- 
 duct very eminently appeared in the latter part of my abode 
 on this iilancr; I am a ftranger in determining whence thefe 
 fecret intimations of Providence derive ; yet methinks they 
 are net only fome proof of the toiwerfe of fpirits, but alfo 
 of the fecret communications they are fuppofed to have 
 with thofe th»t have not palled through the gloomy vale of 
 death. 
 
 Thefe anxieties of mind, and the care of my prefervation, 
 put a period to all future inventions and contrivances, either 
 for accommodation or convenience. I now cared not to 
 drive a nail, chop a (lick, fire a gun, or make a fire, kit 
 either the ncife (lit uld be htard, or the fmoke difcover me* 
 And or. this account I ufed to burn my earthen -ware privately 
 in a c«ve which I found in the wood, and which I made 
 convenient Ur that puipofe ; the principal caufe that 
 .brought me here was to make charcoal, fothatl might bake 
 ?nd drefs my bread and meat without any danger. At that 
 time, a curious accident happened me,- which I fhall now 
 relate. 
 
 While I was cutting down fome wood for making my 
 charcoal, 1 perceived a cavity behind a very thick branch 
 of undtrucod. Curious to look into it, I attained its mouth, 
 and perceived it fuffictent fcr me to iland upright in. But 
 when I had entered, and took a further v»ew, two rolling 
 ihinirg eyes, like flaming liars, (turned to dart thcmfelv, s 
 at me ; fo that I made all the hafte cut that I could, as not 
 knowing whether it was a devil or a monfler that had. taken 
 his residence in that pace. When I recovered a lit le from 
 my furprife, I called myfelf a thcufand fools, for being 
 afraid to fee the devil one moment, who had now lived 
 almoft twenty )ears in the moll retired folitude. And 
 therefore refuming all the courage I had, I took a .flaming 
 firebrand, and in I rufhed again. 1 had not proceeded 
 above three dtps, when I was mere affrighted than before; 
 for then J heard a very loud figh, like that cf a human crea- 
 ture in the greateft agony, fucceeded with a broken noife, 
 rcfembiing w-rds half exp v elTed, and then a broken figh 
 again. Stepping back, Lord ! (thought I to myfelf) whert 
 am I got, into what enchanted place have 1 plunged my- 
 felf, fuch as are reported to contain mifcr&blc capuv.es, till 
 
 
 death puts an end to their farrows ? And, indeed, in fuch 
 great amazement was I,, that it (truck me into a cold fweatj 
 and had my hat been on my head, I believe my hair would 
 have moved it off. But aga'm encouraging myfelf with the 
 hopes of God's protection, I proceeded forward, and by the 
 light of my firebrand, perceived it i o be a moritfrous he-goat, 
 lying on the ground, gafping for life, and dying of mere old 
 age. At firil I ftirred him, thinking to drive him out, and 
 the poor ancient creature ftrove to get upon his feet, but 
 was not able ; fo 1 e'en let him lie ilill to affright the rava- 
 ges, fhould they venture into this cave. J now looked 
 round me and found the place but fmall and fhapelefs. At 
 the farther fide of it, I perceived a fort of an entrance, yet 
 fo low, it muft oblige me to creep upon my hands and 
 kn^es to it ; fo, having no candle, J fufpended my enter- 
 pr.fe till the next day, and then I came provided with two 
 large ones of my own making. 
 
 Having crept upon my hands and*feet ihrcugh this flrait, 
 I found the roof higher up, I think about twenty feet. But 
 furely mortal never faw fuch a glorious fl^ht before ! The 
 roof and walls of -this cave reflected a hundred thoufand 
 lights to me, from my two candles, as though they were in* 
 dented with fhining gold, precious flones, or fparkling 
 diamonds. And, indeed, it was the moil delightful cavity or 
 grotto of its kind that could be deflred, though entirely 
 dry. The floor was dry and level, and had a kind of 
 gravel upon it; no naufeous venomojs creatures to be feen 
 -there, neither any damp or wet about it. J could find no 
 fault but in the entrance, and I began to think that even 
 this might be very neceflary for my defence, and therefor* 
 refolved to make it my moll principal magazine. 1 brought 
 hither two fowling-pieces, and three muikcts, leaving only 
 five pieces at my caftle, planted in the nature of cannon. 
 Of the barrel of gunpowder which I took up out of the tea, 
 I brought away about fixty pounds of good powder, which 
 was not damaged; and this, with a great quant. ty of had 
 for bullets, I removed from my caltie to this retreat, now 
 fortified both by art and nature. 
 
 I fancied myfelf now like one of the giants of old, who 
 were faid to live in caves and holes among the rocks, inac- 
 ceflible to any but themfelves.; or, at lcait, a molt danger- 
 ous attempt. At\C now I defpiied hoth the cunning and 
 itrength of the lavages, either to find roe out or to hurt me. 
 
 D 
 
 
 But I mud not forget the old goat, which caufed my late 
 dreadful amazement. The poor creature gave up the 
 ghofl the day after my difcovery ; and it being difficult to 
 drag* him out, I dug hisgrave, and honourably entombed 
 him in the fame place where he departed) with as much 
 ceremony as any Welch goat that has been interred about 
 the high mountain Penmanmawr. 
 
 I think I now was in the tweny third year of my reign, 
 and my thoughts much eafier than formerly, having contri- 
 ved feveral pretty amufements and diverfions to vafs away 
 the timein a pleafant manner. By this time my pretty Poll 
 had learned to fpeak Englifh, and pronounce his words 
 very articulately and plain; fo that for many hours we ufed 
 to chat together after a familiar manner, and he lived with 
 me no lefs than twenty-fix years. My dog, which was 
 nineteen years old, fixteen of which he lived with me, died 
 fome time ago of mere old age. As for my cats,\hey mul- 
 tiplied fo fatt, that I was forced to kill or drive them into 
 the woods, except two or three which became my particular 
 favourites. Befides thefe, I continually kept two or three 
 houfehold kids about me, which I learned to feed out of my 
 hand, and two more parrots which could talk indifferently, 
 and call Robin/on Cru/oe, but not fo* excellently as the;firft, 
 as not taking that pains with them. I had aifo feveral fea- 
 fowls which I had wounded and cut their wings ; and 
 growing tame, they ufed to breed among the low trees 
 about my caflle walls, all which made my abode very 
 agreeable. ' 
 
 But what unforefeen events fuddenly deftroy the enjoy- 
 ment of this uncertain ftaie of life, when we leaft expect 
 them ! It was now the month of December, in the fouthern 
 folltice, and particular time of my harveft, which required 
 my attendance in the fields.; when going out pretty early 
 one morning, before it was day-light, there appeared to me 
 from the fea-fhore, a flaming light, about two miles from 
 me at the eaft end of the ifland, where 1 had obferved fome 
 favages had been before, not on the other fide, but to my 
 great afRsclion, it was on my iide the ifland. 
 
 Struck with a terrible furprife, and my ufual apprehen- 
 fions, that the favages would perceive my improvements, I 
 returned dirc&ly to my cattle, pulled the ladder after me, 
 making all things look as wild and natural as I poffibly 
 could. In the next place, I put myfelf in a poflure of 
 
 
 defence, loaded my mufkets and piftols, and committing 
 myfelf to God's protection, I refolved to defend myfelf till 
 my laft breath. Two hours after, impatient for intelligence, 
 I fet my ladder up to the fide of the hill, where there was 
 a flat place, and then pulling the ladder after me, afcended 
 to the top, where, laying myfelf on my belly, with my per- 
 fpedfcive giafs, I perceived no lefs than nine naked favages, 
 fitting round a fmall fire, eating, as I fuppofed, human flefh, 
 with their two canoes hailed on more, waiting for the flood 
 to carry them oft again. You cannot eafily exprefs the 
 confternation I was in at this fight, efpecially feeing them 
 rear me; but when I perceived their coming mud be 
 always with the current of the ebb, 1 became more eafy in 
 my thoughts, being fully convinced that I might go abroad 
 with fecurity all the time of flood, if they were not before 
 landed. And, indeed, this proved juft as I imagined ; for 
 no fooner did they all take boat and paddle away, but the 
 tide made N. W. Before they went off, they danced* 
 making ridiculous poftures and geftures, for above an hour, 
 all itark-naked : but whether men or women, or both, I 
 could not perceive. When I faw them gone, I took tw^o 
 guns upon my lhoulders, and placing a couple of piftols in 
 jny belt, with my great fword hanging by my fide, I went 
 to the hill, where at fir ft I made a difcovery of thefe can- 
 nibals, and then law there had been three canoes more of 
 the favages on lhore at that place, which with the reft were 
 making over to the main land. 
 
 But nothing could be more horrid to me, when going to 
 the place of facrifice, the blood, the benes, and other mangled 
 parts of human bodies appeared in my fight ; and fo fired 
 was I with indignation, that I was fully refolved to be re- 
 venged on the firft that came there* though I lod my life 
 in the execution. It then appeared tome, that the vifits 
 which they make to this iiland are not very frequent, it be- 
 ing fifteen months before they came again : but it ill 
 1 was very uneaf) , by reafon of the difmal apprehenii -ru 
 of their furprifing me unawares ; nor dared I orfer to fire a 
 gun on that fide of the iiland whore they ufed to appear, 
 left, taking the alarm, the favages might return with manv 
 hundred canc^s, and then God knows in wha: manner i 
 fhould have made my end. Thus was 1 a year or more be* 
 fore I faw any of thefe devouring cannibals again. 
 
 Da 
 
 
 But to wave this, the following accident, which demand* 
 attention, for a while eluded the force or my thoughts in 
 revenging myfelf on thefe heathens. 
 
 On the 1 6th of May (according to my wooden calendar) 
 the wind blew exceedingly hard, accompanied with abun- 
 dance of lightning and thunder all day, and fucceeded by a 
 very flormy night. The feeming anger of the Heavens 
 made me have recourfe to my Bible. Whilfl I was feri- 
 oufly pondering upon it, 1 was fuddenly alarmed with the 
 sioife of a gun, which I conjectured was fired upon the 
 ocean. Such at? unufual furprife made me Hart up in a 
 minute, when, with my ladder, afcending the mountain as 
 before, that veny moment a flafh of fire prefaged the report 
 •.-of another .gun, which I prefently heard, and found it was 
 from that part of the fea where the current drove me away. 
 I could not but then think, that this mull be a fhip in dif- 
 trefs, and that thefe were the melancholy fignais for a 
 Speedy deliverance. Great, indeed, was jny ibrrow upon 
 Ihis occafion ; but my labours to aflift them mull have 
 proved altogether vain and fruitlefs. However, I brought 
 together all the dry wood that was at hand, and making a 
 pretty large pile, fet it on fire on the hill. I was certain 
 they plainly perceived it, by their firing another gun as fuon 
 as it began' ;o blaze, and after that fever al more from the 
 fame quarter. AJ3 night long I kept up my fire: and 
 svhen the air cleared, up, I perceived fomething a great way 
 at fea directly E. but could not diflinguifh what it was., 
 even with my glafs, by reafon the weather was fa very 
 Soggy out at fea. However, keeping my eyes directly fixed 
 upon it, and perceiving it did not Air, I prefently concluded 
 it mull be a, fhip at anchor, and fo very Jiafty I was to be 
 Satisfied, that taking thejjun, I went to the S. E. part of the 
 ifland, to the fame recks where I had been formerly drove 
 ^way by the current: in which time the weather being 
 perfectly cleared up, to my great forrow, I perceived the 
 wreck of a fhip caft away upon thofe hidden rocks I found 
 when I was out with my beat ; and which, by making a 
 iind of an.eddy, were the cccalion of my p;efervation. 
 
 Thus, what is one man's fafety is another's ruin; for un-

 d in their boat, and faved them (elves that way. I then 
 thought, that perhaps they had done fo, upon feeing my 
 fire, and were caft away in the attempt; for I perceived 
 no boat in the (hip. Bat then I again imagined, that, per- 
 haps, thev had another veiTel in company, which, upon 
 iignal, faved their lives, and took the boat up: or that the 
 boat might be driven into the main ocean, where the fe poor 
 creatures might be in the moil miferabie condition. Bat 
 as all thefe conjectures were very uncertain, i could do no 
 more than commiferate their diftrefs, and thank God for 
 delivering me, in particular, when fo many perifhed in the 
 raging ocean. 
 
 When I considered ferioufly every thing concerning tins 
 wreck, and could perceive no room to fuppofe any of them 
 faved, I cannot explain, by any poilible force of words* what 
 longings my foul felt at this occafton, often breaking out 
 in this manner : " O that there had been but two or three, 
 M nay, even one perfon faved, that wc might have lived 
 u together, converfed with, and comforted one another -!" 
 and fo much were my de&res moved, that when I repeated 
 tbefe words, 4< Oh ! that there h*d been but one!" my 
 hands would clench together, and my fingers prefs the 
 palms of my hands fo clofe, thar, had any foft thing been 
 between, it would have cruihed it involuntarily, while my 
 teeth would (trike together, and fet againfi each other fo 
 flrong, that it required fame time for me to part them. 
 
 Till the laft year of my being on this ifland, I never 
 knew whether or not any had been faved Ous of this fhip. 
 I had the affliction, fome time after, to fee the corpfe of a 
 drowned boy come on more, at the tnd of the iiland which 
 was next the fhipwreck ; there was nothing on him but a 
 feaman's waiftcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen drawers, 
 and a blue linen ftiirt, but no particular mark to guefs whas 
 nation he was of. In hit pocket were two pieces of eight, 
 and a tobacco-pipe, the Jaft of which 1 preferred touch 
 more than I did toe firit. And now the calmnefs of the 
 fea tempted me to venture out in my boat to this wreck, ' 
 not only to get fomething neceflary out of the fhip, but 
 perhaps fome living creature might be on board, whofe 
 life I might preferve. This had fuch a* influence upon 
 my mind, that immediately I went home, and prepared 
 every thing neceflary for the voyage, carry ; g on board

 LIKE AND ADVENTURES 
 
 my boat provifions of ail forrs, with a good quantity of rum, 
 t re.(h water, and a coropafs : fo putting off, I paddled the 
 canoe along the fhore, till I came at laft to the north-eaft 
 part of the ifland, from whence I was to launch into the 
 ocean; hut here the currents ran fo violently, and appeared 
 fo terrible, that my heart began to fail me; forcfeeing that 
 if I was driven into any of thefe currents, I might be car- 
 ried not only out of reach or fight of the ifland, but even 
 inevitably loft in the boiling forges of the ocean. 
 
 So opprefled was I at thefe°troubl?s, that I gave over 
 my enterprife, failing to a little creek on the fhore, where 
 ftepping out, I fct me down on a riling hill, very peniive 
 snd thoughtful. I then perceived that the tide was turned, 
 and the flood came on, which made it impracticable for me 
 to go out for fo many hours. To be more certain how the 
 fets of the tides or current lay when the fiooi came in, I 
 afcended a higher piece of ground, which overlooked the 
 fea both ways ; and here I found that as the current of the 
 ebb fet out ciofe by the fouth point of the ifland, fo the 
 current of the flood fet in clofe by the fhore of the north 
 fide j and all that f had to do, was to keep to the north of 
 the ifland in my return. 
 
 That night I repo(td myfelf in my c*r>oe, covered with 
 my watch-coat, inftead of a blanket, the heavens being my 
 tefier. I fet out with the firft of the tide full north, till I 
 felt the benefit of the current, which carried me at a great 
 rate eaftward, yet not with fuch impetuofity as before, as 
 to take from me all government of my canoe; fo that in 
 two hours time I came up to the wreck, which appeared 
 to me a mod melancholy fight. It feemed to be a Spanifh 
 eiTel by its building, ftuck faft between two rocks ; her 
 (tern and quarter beaten to pieces by the fea ; her main- 
 mail and'foremaft were brought off by the board, that is, 
 broken off (hort. As I approached near, I perceived a dog 
 ©n board, who, feeing me coming, yelped and cried, and 
 no fooner did I call him, but the poor creature jumped into 
 the fea, cut of which 1 took him up, almoftfamilhed w'rth 
 hunger and thirft ; fo that when I gave him a cake of bread, 
 no ravenous wolf could, devour it more greedily; and he 
 drank to that degree of frefh water, that he would have 
 burft himfelf, had l fufFered him. 
 
 The firft fight I met with in the fhip, were two men 
 drowned in the cook-room or forecaftle, inclofed in o«e

 another's arms : hence I very probably fuppofed, that- when 
 the ve/Fel iiruck in the florm, fo high and inceffantly did 
 the waters break in. and over her, that the men not being 
 able to bear it, were flrangled by the conftant rufhing in of 
 the waves, There were feveral cafks of liquor, whetner 
 wine or brandy I could not be pofitive, which lay in the 
 lower hold, as were plainly perceptible by the ebbing out 
 of the water, yet were too Urge for me to pn tend to med- 
 dle with; likewife 1 perceived feveral chefts, which I 
 fuppofed to belong to the feamen, two of which I got into 
 my boat, without examining what was in them. Had the 
 flern of the (hip been fixed, and the forepart broken off, I 
 fhould have made a very profperous voyage ; fince* by 
 what I after found in thefe two chefts, I could not other- 
 wife conclude, but that the fliip muft have abundance of 
 wealth on board; nay, if I mult guefs by the courfe fhe 
 fleered, ihe mull have been bound from Buenos Ayres r . 
 rr the Rio de la Plata, in the fouthem parts of .America, 
 beyond the Brazil?, to the Havanah, in the gulph of Mexico, 
 and fo pei haps to Spain. What became of the reft of the 
 failors, I could not certainly tell; and all her riches figni- 
 iied nothing at that time to any body. 
 
 Searching further, I found a cafk, containing about 
 twenty gallons, full of liquor, which, with fome labour, I 
 got into my boat ; in her cabin were feveral mufkets, which 
 I let remain there* bat teckaway with me a g£S&! p9r v ^ er " 
 horn, with about four pounds of powder in it. I took alfo 
 a fire-lhovel and tongs, two brafs kettles, a copper pot to 
 make chocolate, and a gridiron, all which were extremely 
 neceflary to me, efpecially the fire (hovel and tongs. And 
 fo with this cargo, accompanied with my dog, I came 
 away, the tide ferving for that purpofe : and the fame 
 evening, about an hour within night, I attained the iiland, 
 after the greateil toil and fatigue imaginable. 
 
 That night 1 repofed my wearied limbs in the boat, re~ 
 folving the next morning to harbour what I had gotten in 
 my new-found fubterraneous grotto; and not to carry 
 my cargo home to my ancient cattle. Having refrefhed 
 mv felf, and got all my effeds on ihore, I next proceeded 
 to examine the particulars ; and fo tapping the cafk, I 
 found the liquor to be a kind of rum, but not like what we 
 had at the Brazils, nor indeed near fo good. At the open- 
 ly 
 
 
 mg of the ch eft, feveral things appealed very ufeful to me, 
 for inftance, I found in one a very fine cafe of bottles, con- 
 taining the flneft and befl forts of cordial waters ; each 
 bottle held about three pints, curioufly tipt with filver. I 
 found alfo two pots full of the cboieeft fweetmeats, and 
 two more which the water had utterly fpoiled. There 
 were likewife feveral good fhirts, exceedingly welcome to 
 me; and about one dozen and a half of white linen handker- 
 chiefs and coloured neckcloths, the former of which was 
 abfolutely necelTary for wiping my face in a hot day ; and, 
 in the till, I found three bags of pieces of eight, about eleven 
 hundred in all, in one of which, decently wrapped up in a 
 piece of paper, were fix doubloons of gold, and fome fmall 
 bars and wedges of the fame metal, which I believe might 
 weigh near a pound. In the other cheft, which I gueffed 
 to belong to the gunner's mate, by the mean circumftances 
 which attended ic, I found only fome clothes of very little 
 Value, except about two pounds of fine glazed powder, in 
 three flafks, kept, as I believe, fcr charging the fowling- 
 pieces on any occafion ; Co that, in the whole, 1 had no 
 great advantage by this voyage. The money was indeed 
 as mtre dirt to me, ufelefs and unprofitable, all which I 
 would have freely parted wt*h for two or three pair of Eng- 
 liih fhoes and (lockings; things that for many years I had 
 not worn, except lately thofe which I had taken off the feet 
 of thofe unfortunate men I found drowned in the wreck, 
 yet not fo good as Engliih fhoe3, either for eafe or fervice, 
 I alfo found in the feaman's cheft about fifty pieces of eight 
 in royals, but no gold ; fo concluded that what I took 
 from the firil belonged to an officer, the latter appearing 
 to have a much inferior perifon for its owner. However, 
 as despicable as the money feemed, I likewife lugged it to 
 my cave, laying it up fecurely as I did the reft of my 
 cargo; and after I had done all this, I returned back to 
 my boat, rowing and paddling her along till I came to my 
 old harbour, where I carefully laid her up, and Co made the 
 bcft of my way to my caille. When I arrived there, every 
 thing feemed fafe and quiet: fo that now my only bufinefs 
 was to repofe myfelf after my wonted manner, and take 
 care of my domeftic affairs* But though I might have lived 
 very eafy, as wanting nothing abfolutely needful; yet 
 ftill I was more vigilant than ufual upon account of the fa- 
 vages, never going much abroad ; or, if J did, it was to the 
 
 
 caft part of the ifla^d, where I was well aflured the 
 fava_es never came, and where I might not be troubled to* 
 carry tftat heavy load of weapons for my defence, as I was 
 obliged to do if I went the other way. 
 
 Two years did I live in this aaxious condition, in all which 
 time, contrary to my former refolutions, m> head was filled 
 with nothing but projecls a»d dciigns, how I might efeape 
 from this iiland; and fo much w; re my wandering thoughts 
 bent upon a rambling difpofitlon, that had I Jiad the fame 
 boat that I went from Salee in, I mould have ventured 
 once more to the uncertainty of the raging ocean. 
 
 I cannot, however, but confider myfeif as one of the un- 
 happy perfons, who make themfelves wretched by their 
 diflatisf action with the (latio* which God has placed them 
 in ; for, not to take a review of my primitive condition, and 
 my father's excellent advice, the going contrary to which 
 was, as I may Vy, my original fin, the following miftakes 
 of (he fame nature certainly had been the means of my pre- 
 fent unhappy ftation- What bufcnefs had I to l c ave % fet-

 notwithstanding, the thoughts of my deliverance r n fo

 of reafon and philofophy. And now to uiher in my kind 
 reader wrh greater pleafure to the rem lining part of ihy

 night in March, being the rainy feafon, in the four and 
 twentieth year of my folitude, I lay down to fleep, very 
 weJl in health, without diftemper, pain, or uncommon un~ 
 eafmefs either of body or mind; yet, notwithftanding, I 
 could not compofe myfelf to fleep all the night long. All 
 this tedious while, it is impoffible to exprefs what innumer- 
 able thoughts came into my head. 1 traced quite over the 
 whole hiftory of my life in miniature, from my utmoft re- 
 membrance of things till I came to this ifland, and then 
 proceeded to examine every acVion and paflage that had 
 occurred fince I had taken pofTeffion of my kingdom'. In 
 my reflections upon the latter, I was comparing the happy 
 pofture of my affairs in the beginning of my reign, to thi» 
 life of anxiety, fear, and concern, fince I had difcovered a 
 \ print of a foot in the fand ; that while I continued without 
 apprehenfions I was incapable of feeling the dread and ter- 
 ror I now fuffered. How thankful rather ought I to 
 have been for the knowledge of my danger, fince the 
 greateft happinefs one can be pofTefied of is to have fuifi- 
 cient time to provide again ft it ? How ftupendcus is the 
 gcodnefs of Providence, which fets fuch narrow bounds to 
 the fight and knowledge of human nature,* that while men 
 walk in the midft of fo many dangers, they are kept ferene 
 and calm, by having the events of things hid from their eyes, 
 and knowing nothing of thofe many dangers that furrcund 
 them, till perhaps they are difEpated ard vanifh away. 
 
 When 1 came mere particularly to confider of the real 
 danger I had for fo many years efcaped ; how 1 had walked 
 about in the greateft &curity and tranquillity, at a time, 
 perhaps, when even nothing but the otow of a hill, a great 
 tree, or the common approach of niglr, had interpofed be- 
 tween me and the deftru&ive hands of the cannibals, who 
 would devour me with as good an appetite, as I would a 
 pigeon or curlew; furely all this, 1 fay, could not but 
 make me fincerely thankful to my great Preferver, whofe 
 iingular protedion I acknowledge with the greateft humi- 
 lity, and withcut which I mull inevitably have fallen into 
 the cruel hands of thofe devourers, 
 
 Having thus difcufled my thoughts in the clearefl manner, 
 according to my we.'k underftan dings * next proceeded to 
 confider the wretched nature of thofe deflrcying favages, 
 by feeding, though with great reverence, to inquire, why 
 God Jhould give up any of his creatures to faeh inhumanity^ 
 
 
 even to brutality ttfejf, to devour its own kind ? but as this 
 was rather matter of abftrufe fpeculation, and as my mifer- 
 ablc fituation made me think this of mine the moft uncom- 
 fortable fituation in the world, I then began rather to inquire 
 what part of the world thefs wre'ches lived in ; how far oix 
 the coaft was from vvhence they came ; why ihey ventured 
 over fo far from home ; what kind of boats conveyed them 
 hither; and why I could not order myfelf and my bufinefs 
 i'o^ that I might be as able to attain their country, as they 
 were. to come to my kingdom f 
 
 But then, thought I, how mall I manage myfelf when I 
 come hither? what will become of me if I fall into the 
 hands of the favages ? or how fhall I efcape from them, if 
 they make an attempt upon me ? and foppoflog I fhould not 
 fall into their power, what fhall I do fr provifions, or which 
 way (hall I bend my courfe ? Thefe counter-thoughs threw 
 me into the grev eft horror and confuiion imaginable; but- 
 then J fli',1 looked upon my prefent condition to be the mod- 
 miferable that poffi'ble could be; and that n thing could be. 
 worfe, except death. For (thought 1) could I but attain 
 the more, of the main, I might perhaps meet with fome re- 
 lief, or coaft it along, as I did with my boy Xury, on the 
 African m or e J till I came to fome inhabited country, where 
 I might meet with fome relief, or fall in with fome Chriftian 
 fhip.that might take me in ; and if I failed,, why then Ixould 
 but meet with death, which would put an end taali my mife^ 
 ries* Thefe thoughts, I mull confefs, were the fruit of a 
 diflempered mind, an impatient temper, made defperate,as it 
 were, by long continuance of the troubles and difappoint- 
 ments I had met with in the wreck, where I hoped to have 
 found fame lining perfons to fpeak ta> by whom Lmight. 
 have known in what place 1 was, and of the probable means 
 of my deliverance. Thus,, while my thoughts were agiiared , 
 my refignation to the will of Heaven were entirely fufpend- 
 td> fo that I had no power to fix my mind to any thing, but 
 to the project of a voyager to the main land*-. And, indeed?. 
 fo much was I inflamed upon this account, that it fet my 
 blood in o a fe*menr ? and my pu'fe beat high, as though X 
 had been in a fever ; till nature being, as it we e, fatigued, 
 and -.exhauftx'd with the thoughts of it, made me fubm it my- 
 felf to a file at repofe. 
 
 In fuch a fituation, k is very - fi range, that I did no: 
 dream of what I was fo intent upon j but., inftead of h y nv/ 
 
 D.6 
 
 
 mind roved on a quite different thing, altogether foreign. 
 I dreamed, that as I was ffluing from my caflle one morn- 
 ing, as cuftomary, when I perceived upon the fhore two 
 canoes, and eleven favages coming to land, who had brought 
 with them another Indian, whom they defigned to make a 
 facrifice of, in order to devour; but juft; as they were going 
 to give the fatal blow, methought the poor defigned viclim 
 jumped away, and ran directly into my little thick grov£ 
 before my fortification, to abfcond from his enemies, when 
 perceiving that the others did not follow him that way, I 
 appeared to him; that he humbly kneeled down before 
 me, feemed to pray for my afliftance; upon which I 
 mowed him my ladder, made him afcend, carried him to 
 my cave, and he became my fervant; and when I had 
 gotten this man, I faid to myfelf, now furely I may have 
 fome hopes to attain the main land; for this fellow will 
 ferve me as a pilot, tell me what to do, and wnere I muft 
 go for provifions, what places to fhun, whit to venture to* 
 and what to efcape. But when I awaked, and found all 
 thefe incxpremble impreflions of joy entirely vanifhed, I 
 fell into the greateft dejection of fpirit imaginable. 
 
 Yet this dream brought me to reflect, that one fure way 
 of efcaping was to get a favage ; that after I had ventured 
 my life to deliver him from the blood) jaws of his devourers, 
 the natural fenfe he might have of .fj'cfo a preservation, 
 might infpire him with a lailing gratitude and moft fincere 
 affection. But then this objection reafonably interpofed : 
 how can I effect this, thought I, without I attack a whole 
 company of them, and kill them all ? why mould I proceed 
 ©n fuch a defperate attempt, which my fcruples before had 
 fuggefted to be unlawful? and indeed my heart trembled 
 at the thoughts of (o much blood, though it were a means 
 to procure my deliverance. *Tis true, I might reafonably 
 enough fuppofe thefe men to be real enemies to my life, 
 men who would devour me, was it in their power; fo that 
 it was felf- prefer vation in the higheit degree to free myfelf, 
 by attacking them in my own defence, as lawfully as if 
 they were actually affaulting me ; though all thefe things, 
 I fay, feemed to me to be of the gr^ateft weight, yet, as I 
 juft faid before, the dreadful thoug -ts of (bedding human 
 blood, ftruck fuch a terr r to m> foul, that it was along 
 time before I could reconcile myfeif to it: 
 
 But how far will the ardency of ochre prompt us on ? For 
 
 
 OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 
 
 otwithftanding the many difputes and perplexities I had 
 with myfelf, I at length refolved, right or wrong, to get one 
 of thefc favages into my hands, coft what it would, or even 
 though I fhould lofe my life in the attempt. Infpired with 
 this firm refolution, I fet all my wit? at work, to find out 
 what methods 1 mould take to anfwer my defign : this, in- 
 deed, was fo difficult a tafk, that I could not pitch upon any 
 probable means to execute it: I therefore refolved conti- 
 nually to be in a vigilant pofture, to perceive when the fa- 
 vages came on (hore, and to leave the reft to the event, let 
 the opportunities offer as they would. 
 
 Such was my fixed refolutions ; and accordingly I fet 
 myfelf upon the fcout, as often as I coud, till fuch times as I 
 was heartily tired of it. I waited for above a year and a 
 half, the greateft part of which I went ou: to the weft and 
 fouth-weft corner of the iiland, aim oft every day, to look 
 for canoes, but none appeared. This was a very great dif- 
 couragement ; yet though I was very much concerned, the 
 edge of my defign was as keen as ever, and the longer it 
 Teemed to be delayed, the more eager was i for it; in a 
 word, I never before was fo carefulto fhan the loathing 
 fight of thefe favages, as I was now eager to be with them; 
 and I thought myfeif fu.fticient.ly able to manage one, two, 
 or three favages, if I had them, fo as to make them my en- 
 tire flaves, to do whatever I ihoulci direct them, and pre- 
 vent their being able at any time to do me a mifchief. Many 
 times did I ufe to pleafe myfelf with thefe thoughts, with 
 long and ardent expectations; but nothing prefenting, all 
 my deep projected fchemes and numerous fancies vanUhed 
 away, as though while i retained fuch thoughts, the decrees of 
 Providence were fuch hrt no favages were to come near me. 
 
 About a year and a half after, *hen I was ferioufty mu- 
 fing of fundry other ways how I ihuald attain my end, one 
 morning early, I was very much furprifed by feeing 'no lefs 
 than hve canoes all on ihore t gether, on my fide the ifland, 
 and the favages that belorgedto tnern all landed, and out 
 of my fight. Such a number of them difconcerted all my 
 meafures ; for, feeing fo many boats, each of which would 
 contain fix, and fometi nes more, I could not tell what to 
 think of it, or how to order my meafures, attack t venty 
 or thirty men fingle-handed ; upon which, much difpirited 
 and perplexed, I 1 »y ftill in my caftie ; which, however, I 
 put in a proper poftu.re. for an attack ; and having formerly 
 provided all that was neceflary, was loon ready to enter 
 
 
 upon an engagement, fhould they attempt. Having waked 
 for fome time, my impatient temper would let roe bear it no 
 longer j I fet my guns at the foot of my ladder, and, as 
 ufual, afcended up to the top of the hill at two ftages, (land- • 
 ing, however, in fuch a manner, that my head did not ap- 
 pear above the hill, fo that they could not eafdy perceive 
 me; and here, by the afiiitance of my. perfpe6Hve giafs, I 
 obferved no leis than thirty in number around afire, feafting 
 upon what meat they had dreiTed ; how they cooked it, or 
 what it was, I could not then perfectly tell; but they were 
 all dancing ard capering about the flames, ufing many 
 frightful and barbarous geiUires. 
 
 But while, with a curious eye, I was beholding thefe 
 wretches, my fpirits funk within me, when I perceived 
 them drag two mferabie creatures from the boats, to adl 
 afrem the dreadful* tragedy, a? I fuppofed they had done 
 before. lt 4 was not long before one of them fell upon the 
 ground, knocked down, as I fuppofe, with a club or wooden 
 lword, for that was their manner ; while two or three other* 
 went immediately to work, cutting him open for their cook- 
 ery, and then fell to clevour him as they had done the for- 
 mer, while the laft unhappy captive was left by hi mfelf* 
 till fuch time as they were ready for him. The poor crea- 
 ture looked round him with a wifhful eye, trembling at the 
 thoughts of death; yet, feeing himfelf a little at liberty, na- 
 ture, that very moment, as it were, infpired hirn with hopes 
 of life : He llarted away from them, and ran, with incre- 
 dible fwiftnefs, along the fands, dire&ly to that part of the 
 coafl where my ancient and venerable caftle flood. 
 
 You may well imagine I was dreadfully affrighted upon 
 this occafion, when, as I thought, they purfued him in a 
 whole body, all running towards my palace. And now, 
 indeed, 1 expected that part of my dream was going to 
 be fulfilled, and that he would certainly fly to my grove 
 for protection; but, for the reft of my dream, 1 could de- 
 pend nothing on it, taat the favages would purfue him 
 thither, and find him there. However, my fpiits begin- 
 ning to recover, I flill kept upon my guard; and I now 
 plainly perceived there were but three men out of the num- 
 ber that purfued him. I was infinitely pleated wilh what 
 fwiftnefs the poor creature ran from his purfuers, gaining io 
 much ground upon them, that I plainly perceived could lis 
 thus hold out for half an hour, there was not the lead doubt 
 but he would fave his life from the power of his enemies* 
 
 
 Between them and my caftle there was a creek, that 
 very fame which I failed into with all my efFedts from the 
 wreck of the ihip, on the fteep banks of which I very 
 much feared the poor victim would be taken, if he could 
 not fwim for his efcape: But foon was I out of pain for 
 him, when I perceived he made nothing of it, though at 
 full tide, but with an intrepid courage, fpurred on by the 
 fenfe of danger, he plunged into the flood* fwimming over 
 in about thirty ftrokes, and then landing, ran with the 
 fame incredible flrength and fwiftnefs as before. When 
 the three purfuers came to the creek, one of them, who I 
 perceived could not fwim, happily for his part, returned 
 to his company, while the 'others, with equal courage, but 
 much lefs fwiftnefs, attained the other fide, as though they 
 were refolved never to give over the purfuit. And now 
 or never I thought was the time for me to procure me a 
 fervant, companion, or afliftant; and that I was decreed 
 by Providence to be the inftrument to fave this poor crea- 
 ture's life. I immediately defcended my two ladders with 
 the greater! expedition ; I took up my two guns, which, as I 
 faid* before, were at the bottom of them, and getting up 
 again with the fame hafte towards the hill, I made nearer 
 the fea. In a word, taking a fhort cut dewn the hill, I 
 interpofed between the purfuers and purfued ; hallooing 
 aloud to the latter, who, venturing to look back, was, no 
 doubt, as much terrified at me as I at them. J beckoned 
 to him with my hand, to . return back; in the mean time 
 advancing towards the purfuers, and milling on the fore- 
 rnoft, I knocked him down with the flock of my piece, 
 and laid him flat on the ground. I was very unwilling to 
 fire, leart the reft mould hear, though, at a Jiftance, I que r - 
 tioned whether' they could or no ; and being cut of tight of 
 the fmoke, they could not earliy have known what to make 
 of it. The other favage feeing his fellow fall, flopped as 
 if he had been amazed ; when, advancing towards him, I 
 could perceive him take his bow from his back, and, fix- 
 ing an arrow to it, was preparing (o (hoot at me, and, with- 
 out difpute, might have lodged the arrow in my bread » 
 but, in this abfblutely neceffary cafe of felf^prefervation, I 
 immediately fired at him, and mot him dead, jufl as his 
 hand was going to draw the fatal firing. All this while, 
 the favage who had fled before, flood dill, and had the fa- 
 iisfaction to fee his enemies killed, as he thought, who de- 
 
 
 iigned to take away his life; To affriehted was be with the 
 fire and noife of my piece, that he flood, as it were, like 
 Lot's wife, fixed and immovable, without either fenfe or 
 motion. This obliged me to halloo to him again, making 
 the plaineft figns I could to him to draw nearer. I per- 
 ceived he iinderilood thofe tokens by his approaching to 
 me a little way, when, as if afraid I (hould kill him ;oo, 
 he flopped again. Several times did he advance, and as 
 often (lop in this manner, till coming more to my view, I 
 perceived him trembling as if he was to undergo the fame 
 fate. Upon which I looked upon him with a fmiling 
 countenance, and ft ill beckoning to him, at length tie 
 came clofe to me, and kneeled down, kifling the ground, 
 laid his head upon it, and taking me by the foot, fet it 
 upon his head; and this, as I underftood afterwards, was 
 a token of fwearing to be my flave for ever. I took him 
 up, and, making much of him. encouraged him in the beft 
 macner I could. But my work was not yet firj<fhed; 
 for I perceived the favage whom I had knocked down, was 
 not killed, but ilunned with the blow, and began to cjrae 
 to himfelf. Upon wh'ch I pointed to my new fervant, and 
 fhowed him that his enemy was not yet expired; he fpoke 
 fome words to me, but which I could not underitand ; yet 
 being the firft fund of a man's voice I had heard for above 
 twenty-five years, they were very pleating to me. But 
 there was no time for reflection now, the wounded favage 
 recovering himfelf fo far as to fit upon the ground, which 
 made my poor prifoner as much afraid as before ; to put 
 him out of fear, I printed my < ther gun at the man, with 
 an intent to fhoot him; but my favage, for fo I mult now 
 c?l btm ? prevented my firing, by making a m tion to me 
 to h nd him my Iword, which hung naked »n my belt by my 
 fide. .No fooner did I grant his requeft, but away he runs 
 to hisenemy, and atone blow cut off his head as dexreroufljr 
 as the mod accomplished executioner in Germany could have 
 done; for, it feems, theP* creatures make ufe of wooden 
 fwords m-'ide cf hard wood, which will bear edge enough to 
 cut off heads and rms at one blow. When this valorous 
 explo't was done, he comes to me laughing, as a token of 
 triumph, delivered me my Iword igain, wuh abundance of 
 furprifing geftures, laying it along with the bleeding and 
 ghaftly head of the Indian, at my feet. 
 
 
 Thegreateft aftonifhment that my new fetvant conceived, 
 was the mansei of killing the favage at fiich a diftance, 
 without a bow and arrow; and fuch was his longing deiire 
 to know it; that he firft pointed to the dead carcafe, and 
 then made iigns to me to grant him leave to. go to him. 
 Upon w.ich I bade him go, and, as well as I could, made 
 him fertile I granted his requeft. But when he came 
 there, how wonderfully was he ftruck with amazement! 
 Firft he turned him on one fide, then on another, wonder- 
 ing he could ptrceiye no quantity of blood, he bleeding 
 inwardly; and after fufficientiy admiring the wound the 
 bullets had made in his bread, he took up his bow and ar- 
 rows, and came back again: upon which I turned to go 
 away, making my figns to him to follow, left the reft mif- 
 fing their companions, might come in parfuit of them, and 
 this I found he underftood very well; by his making me 
 underftund that his defign was to bury them, that they might 
 not be feen if it happened, and which by figns again I 
 made him fenfible I very much approved of. Immediately 
 he fell to work, and never was grave-digger more dexterous 
 in the world than he was:, for in an inftant, as I might fay, 
 he fcraped a large hole in the fand with his hands, fufficient 
 to bury the firft in ; there he dragged him, and without any 
 ceremony he covered him over; in like manner he ferved 
 the others fo that I am fure no undertaker could be more 
 expert in hia bufinefs ; for all this was done in eis than a 
 quarter of an hour. I then called him away, and inftead 
 of carrying him dirc&ly to my cattle at firft, 1 conveyed him 
 to my cave on the farther part of the iflind ; and fo my 
 dream was now fulfilled in that pirticular, that my grove 
 ihould prove an afylum or fanctuary to him. 
 
 Weary and faint, hungry and thirfty, undoubtedly mull 
 this poor creature be, fupported chiefly by the vivaci;y of 
 fpirit, and uncommon tranfports of joy that his deliverance 
 occafioned. Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raifins 
 to eat, and water to drink, on which he fed very cheerfully, 
 to his exceeding refrefhment. I then made him a conveni- 
 ent bid with a parcel of rice ftraw, and a blanket upon it, 
 (a bed wh ci I ufed aiyfelf fomstimes,) and then pointing 
 to it, made figns for him to lie down to fleep, upon whicii 
 the poor creature went to take a welcome repofe. 
 - Indeed he was a very comely, handfome young fellow, ex- 
 tremely well-made, with ftraight long limbs, no: too large, 
 
 
 but tall and well fhaped,. and, as near as I" could reckon, 
 ab'.ut twenty-fix years of age. His countenance had no- 
 thing in it fierce or furly, but rather a fort of majefty in his 
 face; and yet, efpecially when he fmiled, he had all the 
 fweetnefs and fofcnefs of an European. His hair was not 
 curled like wool, as many of the blacks are, but long and 
 black, with the moft beautiful yet carelefs treffes fpreading 
 over his (boulders. He had a very high and large forehead, 
 with a great vivacity and fpafkling foarpnefs in his eyes. 
 His fkin was not fo tawny as the Virginian Brazilians, or 
 other Americans, but rather of a bright dun olive colour, 
 that had fomething agreeable in it, though not very eafy to 
 give a defcription of. His face was round and plump, with 
 a fmall nofe, very different from the flatnefs of the negroes', 
 a pretty fmall mouth, thin lips, fine tech, very well fet, 
 and white as the driven fnow. In a word, fuch hahdfome 
 features, a»d exact fymmetry in evcy part, made me con- 
 sider, that I had faved the life of an Indian prince, m lefs 
 graceful and accomplifhed than the great Oroonoko, who-fe 
 memorable* behaviour, and unhappy contingences of life, 
 have charmed the world, both to admiration of his perfon> 
 and companion to his fufferings. 
 
 Bui let him be either prince or peafant, all my happinefs 
 centered in this, that I had now got a good fervant or com- 
 panion, to whom, as he deferved, I was refolved to prove a 
 kind mailer, and a raiting friend. He had nor, I rmnk, nepr 
 above an hour, when he awaked again, and while I was 
 milking my goats hard by, out he runs from the cave towards 
 me in my inclofure, and laying himfelf down on the 
 ground, in the loweit proftraticn, made all the antic geflures- 
 imaginable, to exprefs his thankfulnefs to me, for being: hia 
 deliverer. I confefs, though the manner of his behaviour 
 feemed to be ludicrous enough to occaiion laughter, yet I 
 was very much moved at his affection.', fo that my heart 
 melted within me, fearing he might die away in excrfe of 
 joy, like reprieved malefactors : efpecially as I was incapable 
 either to let him blood, or adm milter phytic. It were 
 to be wifhed that Chriftians would take example by this 
 Heathen, to have a lading remembrance of the benefits and 
 deliverances they have received, by the kind mediation 
 and powerful interposition of their b^nefaccprs and deliver* 
 ers: and it would be likewife happy for mankind, were 
 there no occafion to blame many, who, inftead of thankfully 
 
 
 acknowledging favours and benefits, rather abufe and con* 
 demn thofe who have been the inftrumcnts to fave them 
 from deftruftion. 
 
 But leaving thefe reflections, I returned to the object 
 that occafioned them; for my man, to conclude the laft 
 ceremony of obedience, laid down his head again on the 
 ground, clofe to my foot, and fet my other foot upon his 
 head, as hehad done before, making all the (igns of fubjec- 
 tion, fervitude, and fubmifiion imaginable, and let me un- 
 derftand he would ferve me as long as his life endured. As 
 I underload him in many things, I made him fenfible I was 
 very well pleafed with him; and, in a little time, I began 
 to fpeak to him, and learn him to talk to me again, In the 
 firil place I made him underftarfd his nime was to be Fri- 
 day, becaufe it was upon that day I faved his life ; then I 
 taught him to fay Mafter, which 1 made him fenfible was 
 to be my name. I likewife taught him to fay Yes and No, 
 and to know what they meant. I gave himfome milk in an 
 earthen pot, making him view me while I drank it before 
 him, and foaked my bread in it ; I gave him a cake of bread, 
 and caufed him to foak it likewife, to which he readily conv 
 fented, making iignsof the greateft fatisfaction imaginable. 
 
 All that night did I keep him there; b*j$ no fooner did 
 the morning light appear, when I ordered him to arifV, and 
 come along with me, with certain tokens that I would give 
 him fome clothes like mine, at which he feemed very glad, 
 being ftark naked, without the leaf! covering whatever. — 
 As we paflfed by the place where the two men had been 
 interred, my man pointed directly to their graves, fnowing 
 me the marks that he had made to find them again, giving 
 m? to underftand, by ligns, that we fh uld dig them up, 
 and devour them. At this I appeared extremely difpleafed, 
 exprefTed my utmofl abhorrence, as if I would vomit at the 
 apprehenfisn of it, beckoning with my hand to come away, 
 which he did with the greateft reverence and fubmiflion. 
 After this I conducted him to the top of the hill, to view if 
 the reft of the favages were yet remaining there; but when 
 I looked through my perfpe&ive glafs, f could fee no ap- 
 pearance of them, nor of their canoes; fo that it was very 
 evident they never minded their deceafed companions whom 
 we had flam; which if they had, they would furely have 
 fearched for, or left one boat behind for them to folio w$ 
 after they returned from their purfuit. 
 
 
 Ourioilty, and adefire of fatisfaction, animating me with 
 courage to fee this fcene of barbarity, I took toy man Fri- 
 day with me, putting a fword into his hand, with the bow 
 and arrows at his back, which I perceived he could uft 
 very dextroufly, caufing him to carry one gun for me,- and 
 I two for myfelf; and thus equipped againlt all attacks, 
 away we marched directly to the place of their bloody en- 
 tertainment. But when I came there, I was itruck with 
 the utmofl horror at fo dreadful a fpectaele, whijft Friday 
 was no way concerned about it, being no doubt in his turn 
 one rf thefe devourers. Here lav feveral human bones, there 
 feverai pieces of mangled fle/h, fcalf eaten, mangled and 
 fcorched; whilft ftreams of blood ran promifcuoufty as 
 waters from a fountain. As 1 was muling on this dreadful 
 fight, Friday took all the pains he could, by particular 
 figns, to make me underfiand, that they had brought over 
 four prifoners to feaft upon, three of whom they had easen 
 up, and that he was the fourth, pointing to himfelf ; that 
 there having been a bloody battle between them and his 
 great king, in the jult defence of whom he was taken pri* 
 foner, with many others, all of thefe were carried oft to 
 different places to be devoured by their conquerors ; and 
 that it was his misfortune to be brought thither by thefe 
 wretches for the fame purpofe. 
 
 After I was made fenfible of thefe things, I caufed Fri- 
 day to gather thofc horrid remains, and lay them together 
 upon a heap, which I ordered to be fet on fire, and burn 
 them to aihes; My man, however, itill retained the oature 
 of a cannibal, having a hankering ftomach after fome of the 
 flefh; but fuch an extreme abhorrence did 1 exprefs at the 
 leaft appearance of it, that he durft not but conceal it ; fore 
 I made him very fenfible, that if he offered any fuch thing, 
 I would certainly (hoot him. 
 
 This being done, I carried my man with me tomycaftle* 
 and gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had taken 
 out of the poor gunner's chelt before mentioned , and 
 which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well: in the 
 next place I made him a jerkin of goat's (kin, fuch as my 
 ikill was able to manage, and indeed I thought myfelf then 
 a tolerable good tailor. I gave him alfo a cap which I 
 made of a hare's fkin, very convenient and falhionahle. — 
 Thus being clothed tolerably well? my man was no lefs 
 proud of his habit, than! was at feeing him in it. Indeed he 
 
 
 went very awkwardly at nr , t ^rs being too heavy 
 
 on his thighs, riOt ufed to bvar ar.y weight, and the fleeves 
 of che waistcoat gai.ed hs fhbulders and the infide of his 
 arms ; but by a little eafing where he complained they hurt 
 him, ani by ufmg himlcif to tfcem, at length he took to 
 them very well. 
 
 My next concern was, where I fbould lodge him ; and 
 that I might do well by him, ahel )<ev be perfectly eafy my- 
 felf, I erecled a tent for him in th< vacant pace between 
 my two fortifications, in the infide of the lail, and the out- 
 fide of the firft ; and, as there was an entrance or door in- 
 to my cave, I made a formal framed door-cafe, and a door 
 to open on the infide; I barred it up in the night time, ta- 
 king in my ladders too, fo that, was my man to prove treach- 
 erous, there could be no way to come at me in the infide 
 of my innernufl wall, without making fo much noife in 
 getting over, that it muft needs waken me; for my firft 
 wall had now a complete roof over it of long poles, fpread- 
 ing over my tent, and leading op to the tide of the moun- 
 tain, which was again laid crofs with fmaller Hicks inftead 
 of laths, and thatched over a great thicknefs with the rice 
 itraw, which was as itrong as reeds: and at the hole of the 
 j)lace, left on purpoie to go in and out by the ladder, had 
 placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it had been attempted 
 on the outfide, would not have opened at all, but have 
 rallen down, and made a great noife : and as to my wea- 
 pons, every night I took them all to rny bedfide. 
 
 But there was no cccafic n for this precaution ; for furely 
 
 ever matter had a more iincere, faithful, and loving fer- 
 
 /ant than Friday proved to me. Without paflion, fullen- 
 
 •efs, or defign, perfectly obliging and engaging, his affec- 
 
 •,*ons were as much tied to the, as thofe of a child to its 
 
 .parents; and I might. venture to fay, he would have facri- 
 
 eSced his life for the faving mine, upon any occalion what- 
 
 foever. And, indeed, the many teftimonies he gave me of 
 
 ds, f efficiently convinced me tnatl had no occafion to ufe 
 
 efe precautions. And here I could not but reflect with 
 
 sat wonder, that, however it hath pleafed the Almighty 
 
 hie providence, and in the government of the creation, 
 
 to take from fc 6 reat a part of the world of his creatures, 
 
 tue noble ufes to which their faculties, and the powers of 
 
 their fouls are adapted ; yet that he has bellowed upon 
 
 
 them the fame reafon, affections, fentiments of kindnefs 
 and obligation, paffions of refentment, fincerity, fidelity, 
 and all the capacities of doing and receiving good that he 
 has given us; ^nd that when he is gracioufly pleafed to 
 offer them occafions of exerting thefe, they are as ready* 
 nay, more ready, to apply them to the proper ufes for 
 which they were bellowed, than we often are, Thefe 
 thoughts would make roe melancholy, efpecially when I 
 corfidcred how mean a ufe we make of all thefe, even 
 though we have thefe powers enlightened by the Holy 
 Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of this world, as an 
 addition to our underftanding ; and why it has pleafed the 
 heavenly wiWcm to conceal the like faving knowledge 
 from fo many millions of fouls, wbp would certainly make 
 a much better ufe. of it than generally mankind do at this 
 time. Thefe reflect ion should fometimes lead me fo far 
 as to inveigh the fovereignty of Providence, and, as it were, 
 arraign the juftice of fuch an arbitrary difpcfition of things, 
 that fhould obfeure that light from fome, and reveal it to 
 others, and yet expect a like duty from all. Butlclofed 
 it up, checking my thoughts with this conclufion ; firfl, 
 That we were ignorant of that right and law by which 
 thofe fhould be Condemned ; but as the Almighty was ne- 
 ceflarily, and by the nature of his eflence, infinitely juft 
 and holy; fo it could not be otherwife, but that if thefe 
 creatures were all defined to abfence from himfelf, it was 
 on account of finning againft that light, which, as the 
 Scripture fays, was a law to themfelves, and by fuch a rule 
 as their consciences would acknowledge to be juft, though 
 the firil foundation was not discovered to us. And, fe~ 
 condly, That ftill as we were the clay in the hand of the 
 potter, no veffel could thus fay to him, " Why hail thou 
 u faftiiored me after this manner." 
 
 I had not been above two or three days returned to my 
 caftle, but my chief defign was, how 1 fhould bring Friday 
 off from this horrid way of feeding; and to take from hira 
 that inhuman relifh he by nature had been accuflomed to t 
 J thought it my duty to let him tafte oiher flefh, which 
 might the rather tempt him to the lame abhorrence i fo 
 c/ten expretfed againit their accurfed way of living. Upon 
 which, one morning I took him out with me, with an in* 
 tention to kill & kid out of the flock and bring it home, and 
 dieis it. As I was going, I perceived a ihe-g^at lytug 
 
 
 down in the fhade, and two yourg kids fitting by her.— 
 Immediately I catched hold of my man Friday, and bidding 
 him (land (till, and not ftir, I prefented my piece, and ihot 
 one of 'he kids. My poor fervant, who at a diilance per- 
 ceived me kill his ardverfkry* and yet did not know by what 
 means cr how it was done, flood trembling and furprifed* 
 and looked fo amazed, that I thought he would have funk 
 into the earth He did not fee the kid I aimed at, or be- 
 held I had killed it, but ripped up his waiftcoat to fee if he 
 was not wounded, thinking my refoluaon was to kill him; 
 ;for coming to me, he fell on his knees, eameftly prcnoun- 
 : cing many things which I did not underftar.d the meaning 
 3 of; which at length I perceived was, that I would not 
 take away his life. 
 
 Indeed I was much concerned to fee him in that con- 
 i dition, where nature is upon the fevereft trial, when the 
 immediate hand of death is ready to put for ever a period 
 I to this mortal life-; and, indeed, fo much companion had I 
 to this creature, that it was with difficulty I refrained from 
 \ tears.. But, however, as another fort of countenance was 
 r.ecfilary, and to convince him that I would do him no 
 \ harm, I took him fmiling by the hand, then laughing at 
 him, and pointing to the kid which I had flain, made figns 
 to him to fetch it, which accordingly^ he did* No lefs 
 I curious was he in viewing how the creature was killed, than 
 he had been before in beholding the Indian ; which, while 
 he was admiring at, I charged my gun again, and prefently 
 perceived a great fowl, like a hawk, perching upon a tree 
 within Ihot: and, therefore, to let Friday underlland what 
 I was going to do, I called him to me again, pointing at the 
 I fowl, which I found to be a parrot. I made him under- 
 Hand that I would fhoot and kill that biid; accordingly I 
 fired, and bade him look, when immediately he faw the 
 parrot fall down. Again he Hood like one amazed, not- 
 ! withftanding all 1 had faid to him : and the more confound- 
 ed he was, becaufe he did not perceive me put any thing 
 i into my gun. Undoubtedly a thing fo utterly ft range, 
 carrying death along with it, far or near, either to man or 
 beaft, muft certainly create the greateft aftonifhment to one 
 I who never had heard fuch a thing in his whole life ; and 
 really his amazement continued fo long, that had I allowed 
 it he would have proftrated himfelf before me and my gun, 
 with the greateft worfhip and adoration. As for the gun 
 
 
 in particular, he wc u!d not fo much as touch it far feveral 
 days after, but would come and communicate nis thoughts 
 to it, and talk to it, as if the fenfetefs pice had underitood 
 and a<:fwered him ; all this I could perceive him do, when 
 he thought my back was turned, the chief intent of which 
 wss, to defire it not to kill him, as I afterwards came to 
 underhand. 
 
 I never flrove to prevent hie admiration, nor hinder him 
 from thofe comical geitures he u fed on fuch occalions ; but 
 when his aftonifhment was a little over, I made tokens to 
 him to run and fetch the parrot that I had fhot; which 
 accordingly he did, ilaying fometime longer than ufual, by 
 reafon the bird not being quite dead, had fluttered fome 
 way further from the place where he fell, in the mean 
 time, while he was locking for her, I took the advantage of 
 Chargr g my gun again, fo that I might be ready for any 
 other mark that offered ; but nothing more occurred at that 
 time. So I brought home the kid, and the fame evening 
 took off the fkin and divided the carcafc as well as I could. 
 Part of the fleih I ftewed and boiled in a pot I had for this 
 purpofe. And then (preading my table, I fat down, giv- 
 ing my man fome of it to eat, who was wonderfully pieafed, 
 and feemed to like it very well: but what was the moft 
 furpriiing to him was to fee me eat fait with it: upon 
 which he made me underfland, that the fait was very bad 
 for me ; when putting a little into his mouth he feemed to 
 naufcate in fuch a manner, as to fpit and fplutter at it, 
 and then wafhed his mouth with frefh water : but to fhow 
 him how contrary his opinion was to mine, I put feme 
 meat into my mouth without fair, and feigned to fpit and 
 , fplutter as much for the want of it, as he had done at it ; 
 yet all this proved of no iigniiicaiicn to Friday ; and it was 
 along while before he could endure fait in his meat or bro.h, 
 and even then but a fmall quantity. 
 
 Thus having fed him Efficiently with boiled meat and 
 broth at that time, the next day I was refclved to feafl him 
 with a rcai ed piece of the kid. And having no fpit to 
 fallen it, nor jack to turn it, 1 made ufe of that common 
 artifice which many of the common people of England have, 
 that is, to let two poles upon each iide of the firr, and 
 one crofs on the top, hangirg the meat thereon with a 
 firing, and fo turning round continually, roaft it, in the 
 fame manner as we re2d bloody tyrams of old crually roaft- 
 
 
 «4 the holy martyrs. This practice caufed great adnvra- 
 tion in my man Friday, being quite another way than that 
 to which the lavages were accuilomed. But when he came 
 to tafte th? (weetnefs and tendernefs of the fL(h, be ex- 
 pref entire fatis faction- above a- thoufand different 
 
 ways, And as I cculd not but underfland his meaning, you 
 may be fure I was as wonderfully pleaftd, especially whea 
 he made -it alfo very plain to me, that he would never, 
 while he Jived, eat man's flefti more. 
 
 It was now high time I (hould fet my fervant to work; 
 To next da? J kt him to beat out feme corn, and fife it ia 
 the fame manner as I had dene before. And really the fei* 
 low was very quick and handy in the execution of any thing 
 1 ordered him t . go about, I made him understand that u 
 was to make bread for us to eat, and afterwards let him fee 
 roe makv. it la (hart, he diel every thing as 1 c-rdered him, 
 and in a little time as well as I ccaid perform it myfeif. 
 
 JBut now oonfjoering that 1 had two mouths to feed in- 
 itead of one, it was neceilarY that I rruit provide more 
 .ground for my barveit, ana plant a larger quantity of cora 
 than I commonly uled to do; upon which 1 marked out a 
 larger piece of Jand, fe^ng it in, in the fame manner as 
 J. had done before ; in the execution of which i muft give 
 Friday this good word, that no man could work more hardy, 
 or with better will than he did ; and when I mad him fer- 
 fible that it was for bread to ferve hum as weii as me, he 
 t4ien very paflionate'y made me under Hand, thuh: thought 
 I had much mere hbwr on his account, than I had tor my- 
 Jeff; and that no p-ins or diligence fnould be wanting ia 
 him, if I wculd but dirt el him in thoie works wherein he] 
 rcight proceed. 
 
 1 mull certainly own, that this was the moS pleaant year 
 I ever had in the ifland ; for after tGmetime, Friday began 
 to talk preity well, and underfiood the names of thofe things 
 which I was wont to call !or, and the places where 1 ufed 
 cb fend him. So that my long filent tongue, whrch had been 
 ufeiefs fo many years, except in an exclamatory manner, 
 either for deliverance or bleffings, row began to be occu- 
 p ed in teaching, and talking to myman Friday ; fori de^4 
 i had fuch a lingular fatis fact on in the fellow Jhiavi elf, fii 
 innocent did his fimple and unfeigned hondiy appear more 
 and more to me every day, that 1 realty began entirety i«. 
 love him ; and fur his part, I believe there was no lc veldt, 
 
 E 
 
 
 and that his nature had been more .charmed 'by his exceed- 
 ing kindnefs, and his affediions more placed upon me, than 
 any other object whatfoever among his own countrymen. 
 J once had a great mind to try if he had any hankering in- 
 clination to his own country again; and by this time having 
 learned the Engliih fo well, that he could give me tolerable 
 anfwers to any queftion which I demanded ; I afked him 
 whether that nation to which he belonged, ever conquered 
 in battle ? The queftion made Friday to fmile, and to which 
 he anfwered, " Yes, yes, we always fight the better f' as 
 much as to fay they always got the better fa fight. Upon 
 which we proceeded on the following difcourfe : You fay, I 
 faid F, that you always fight the better; why, then, Friday, 
 how came you to be taken prisoner ? 
 
 Friday. But for all that, my nation beat much* 
 
 Mafier. How fay you, heat f if your nation beat them, 
 how came you to be taken prifoner ? 
 
 Friday. They mere many mans than my nation in the 
 place where me was ; they take one, two, three, *nd me : 
 my nation much over beat them in the yonder place where 
 me no was, there my nations man beat one, two, three great 
 toufand. 
 
 Mafier. Then why did not your nation recover you from 
 the hands of your enemies ? 
 
 Friday* They run one, two, or three, and me: they make 
 all go in the canoe ; my nation have no cance that time. 
 
 Mafier, 'Tis very well, Friday ; but what does your 
 iiatioo do with theprifoners they take r Do they carry them 
 dway and eat them, as thefe have done ? 
 - Friday. Yes, yes, my nation eats mans too, eat up all. 
 
 Mafier. To what place do they carry them to be devoure 
 
 Friday. Go to other nations where they think. 
 
 Mafier, Do they bring >hem hither? 
 
 Friday. Ye&, come over hither, come over other place. 
 
 Mafier. And have you been with them here, -Friday ? 
 
 Friday, Yes, me been here (pointing to the noub-ix)eft cf 
 the jjlofidy Being thejide where they ufid to land). 
 
 Thus having gotten what account 1 could from my man, 
 Tplainly underitood, that he had been as bad as any of the 
 reft of the cannibals, having been formerly among the fa- 
 vages who ufed to come on fhore on the fartheft part of the 
 ifhnd, upon the fame bloody occafion as he was brought 
 hither for ; and Tome -time after I carried him to that place 
 
 
 where he poinded; and no (boner did he come there, but 
 he preOntl- k cW the ground, fignifying to me that he wa« 
 once here whe they Ue up twenty men, two women, and 
 a young child : but as he could not explain the number in 
 En^iifh, he d\ A . it by fo many ftones in a row, making a 
 fign for me o count 'hem. 
 
 This paffage I had. the rather mentioned, becaufe it led 
 to things more important and ufeful for me to know; for 
 after I had the Talis factory difcourfe with him, my next 
 queftion was, how far it was from the iflard to the fhore, 
 and whether the canoes -were not often loft in the "cean ? 
 to which he anfwercd there was no danger; that no canoes 
 were ever loft ; but, that after a little way out to the fea, 
 , there was a ftrong current, and a wind always one way in 
 the afternoon. This 1 thought at nrft to b ; - no mere than 
 the fets of the tide, of going rut or coming in ;.but 1 after- 
 wards underdo** ci it was occafioned by the great draught 
 and reflux cf the mighty river Oroonoko, in the inoqth or 
 gulf or which I imagined my kingdom lay; and that the 
 land which I perceived to the W. or N. W. muft be the 
 great iiland Trinidad, on the north of the river. . A thcu- 
 land quefticms (if that wouid faircfy me) did I afk Friday, 
 about the nature of the country, the fea, tfee coafis, the in- 
 ' habitants, and what nations were neareft them ; to which, 
 qu aliens the poor fellow declared all he knew, with the 
 greatelt optnnefs, and utnioft fincerity. When I demand- 
 ed of him the panicu'ar names cf the various, nations of his 
 jfort of people, he coUid only as iwer me in general, that 
 they were called Caribbee., Hence it was 1 con lidered that 
 thefe mult be the Caribbees, io much taken rdice of by 
 our maps, to be rn that part of America, which reaches 
 from the mouth cf the river Orooncko to Guiana, and fo 
 on to St. Martha. Then Friday proceeded to tell me, that 
 iip a great way beyond the moon, as much as to fay, be- 
 yond the fetting of the moon, which muft be W. from their 
 c< untry, there dwelt white-btarded men, fuch as 1 was, 
 pointing to my whifkers, and that they: kill muchmahs. I 
 was not ignorant with what barbarity the Spaniards treated 
 thefe creatures ; fo that I prefemly concluded it muft be 
 them, whofe cruelties had fpread throughout America, to 
 be remembered even to fucceeding generations. 
 
 Well, you may be f^re, this knowledge, which the im- 
 f erfeel knowledge of mv man had hd me to, was very 
 ! ' E 2 ' 
 
 
 comfortable to me, and made me fo curious as to aik hint 
 how i might depart from this ifland, and get amongir. thoie 
 white men? He told me, "Yes, yes, I might go in two 
 canoes." In two canoes, thought I, what dues my man 
 mean ? furely he mea^s one for himfelf, and another for me; 
 2nd if not, hew mud two canoes hold me without being 
 joined, or one part of my body being put in one, and ano- 
 ther in arother? And indeed it was a long time before I 
 nnderftood his meaning, which was, that it muii be a large 
 boat as big as two canoe?, able to bear with the waves, and 
 not fo liable to be overwhelmed as a fmall one mutt be. 
 
 I believe there is no Mate of life but what may be happy, 
 H people wouid but endeavour for their part to make it fo. 
 "He is not the happ eft man that has the moll r'-ches ; but ha 
 that is content .wth what he has.. Before I had my fer- 
 var.t, 1 thought my felfmtfe'rabie till I had him; and now that 
 1 had enjoyed the happy benefits of him, I (till complained, 
 and begged a deliverance from a place of retirement, eafe, 
 and plenty, where Providence had fufficiently blefied me. 
 In a ttord, from this time i entertained (bme hopes, that 
 ins time or other I might find an opportunity to make my 
 efcape from this ifland, and i\ dus poor favags might be 
 a great furtherance thereto. 
 
 All the time firice my man became fo intelligent as to un- 
 cleriland ard fpeak to me, 1 fjpared no pains nor diligence 
 to inilruct him, accottling to my poor (hare of knowledge 
 in the principles of religion, and the adoration that he ought 
 to pay to the true God, One ime, as I very well remem- 
 ber, i afked him who made him? At fiat the innocent 
 crea ure did not underitand what 1 meant, but rather thought 
 I afked him who was his father ? Upon which I took ano- 
 ther way to make him fenfible, by demanding from him an 
 anfwer to this queftion. Friday, faid I, Wf>o h ic that made 
 the fea, this' ground whereon we walk, and .all thefe hills 
 and woods which we behold ? and here, indeed, 1 did not 
 mifs my intention; for he tcld me it was Old Benamuckee 
 (the Gcd whom I fuppofe thefe lavages adored) who lived 
 a great way beyond ail. Sut as to his a'tribues, poor Fri- 
 day was an utter (hanger. He could defenbe nothing of 
 this great perfon ; and -all that he could fay was, that he 
 was very old, much older than the fea and land, the moon, 
 or the fhrs. Friday, faid f again, if this great and old per- 
 fon has made all things in the world, how comes it to pafs, 
 
 
 lhat al! things, as you in particular, do net adore and wo - 
 ihip him? Upon this, looking very gave, with a perfect 
 fweet io k of innccence, he replied, "Mailer, ail things lay 
 Q to him,'* by which it may be reafonably ft; ppo fed he 
 meant adoration. And where, (aid f j dathe people of your 
 country go when they die? He anfwered to Benanruckee . 
 What? and thofe people that are eaten up, do they go there?' 
 " Bcnamuckee" faid he, V love 'em dearly; me pray to 
 *' Benamuckee m ? de ^canoe, and Benamucke^ would love me 
 u when they eat me all up.' J< 
 
 Such dsicourfes as thefe had V with my nfan; and fuch- 
 made me (enfible, that the true God is worfhiped, though 
 under imp*rfcl ffmilitudes- and that the 'alfe adoranon 
 which the Heathens give to their imaginary Deity, is as^reat 
 an argument of the divine efTence,' as the nu ft learned 
 Atheifts (faljely/o called J can bring again ft it; f-r God' 
 will be glorified in his works, let their denomination be 
 what it will ;. and I cannot be cf that opinion which fome 
 eenceive, th t God {hould decree men to be damned for 
 want of a right notion of* faith, in a place where the wifdom 
 of the Almighty has not permitted it to b? preached ; and 
 therefore cannot but conclude, that, fince obedience is the 
 beft fieri fice, thefe poor matures, acling by that light and 
 knowledge which they are poficfled of, may, undoubtedly, 
 obtain a happy falvation, though not that enjoyment with 
 Chrift, as his faints, confefTors, and martyrs mult enjoy. 
 
 But laying thefe determinations afide, more rit for divines 
 than me to difcufij I began to inftrucl my fervant in the 
 faving knowledge of the true Deit\, in which the directions 
 of God's Holy Spirit affiled me. J lifted up my hands to 
 Heaven, and pointing thereto, told him, that the great 
 Maker of Heaven and Earth lived there ; tha*, as h <s infinite 
 power fafhionei this world out of a confufe J chaos, and 
 made it in that beautiful frame which we behold, d he 
 governs and preferves it by his unbounded knowiedge, 
 fovereign greatnefs, and peculiar providence ; that he was 
 omnipotent, could do every thi ig for us, give every ihing to 
 us, and take every thir ; g awiy from us ; that he wa> a re- 
 warder and punifher of good and evil aclions ; th3t there was 
 nothing but what he knew, no thoughts fo fecret but what he 
 could bring to light : and thus by degrees I opened his eye$ f 
 and deicribed to him the manner of the creation of the 
 
 E3 
 
 
 world, % frruatioij of paradife, the tranfgreflion of our 
 fifit parenjs-, the wickedness of God's peculiar people, and 
 the ufiiveffal iins and abom nations or the who-e earth.— . 
 When thele tilings were implanted in his mud, I tod him, 
 that as God's pi -ice was eqaal to his mf rcy, he refolv^d to 
 deftrov this world, till his oon Jefus Chriit interpefed in our 
 behalf; and, to procure our. redemption, obtained kave of 
 his heavenly Father to come down from Heaven into the 
 world, whtre he took h<jman .nature upon him, inHrucTt'd us 
 in our way to eternal lite, and died'as a facrifice for our fins; 
 that he was now afcendta into Heaven, mediating for our 
 pardon, ddiveri g our piutu> s and obtaining '.all thofegood 
 benefits w ; »:ch e /k in hh name, by humble and hearty 
 pra trs, oil which were heard at the thone of Heaven,— 
 As very frequent v I ufed to inculcate things into his mind 
 Friday, c nc- day told me, :hat if our g,*eat God could hear 
 .lis beyo- d (he fun, he mutt furely be a greater God than 
 their Bena.rtuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet 
 could not _h-:ar th< m till they afcended the great mountains,, 
 where he dwelt, to freak to him. What, faidi, Friday, 
 did you go thither to fpeak to him too? He anfwftred,, 
 * 4 No, they never went thai were young men, none but eld 
 %c men, called their Ovwauzkee/ 9 meaning the Indian prieils, 
 u who went 'to fay O, fo »e called faying their prayers,) 
 •'.and they returned ba-k, and told then wh t Benamuckee 
 " faid^' From hence, I could' not but obferve how ha p^y- 
 we Chrittians are, who have God's immediate revelation 
 for our certain guice ; and '.hat our faith is neither milled,; 
 nor our reaforv impofed upon, by any let of men; fuch as 
 fche r e Indian impoilors. 
 
 But, to clear up this palpable cheat to my man Friday, I 
 told h : m, that the pretence of their ancient men going up to 
 the mountain to (ay O to their God Benamuckee , was an im- 
 pofUire, and that their bringing back :n aniwer was all a 
 fham, if not ^orfe; for tlut, if there was any fuch thing 
 fpoken to them, furely it mud proceed from an infernal 
 fpirit. And here 1 thought it necefl'ary to enter into a long 
 difcourfe with him, which 1 did after this manner: 
 
 Friday, faid I, you mult know, that before this world 
 was madr, there was an Almighty power exiting, by whofe 
 power all things *ere r-ade, and whofe Majefty (hall have 
 no end. To be gl nfied and adored by beings of a heaven- 
 ly nature, he created angels and archangels, that is, glorified 
 
 
 Spirits refembling himfelf, to encornpafs his throne, eter- 
 nally Tinging forth his . praife in his mo ft heavenly founds 
 and divine harmony. And, among this heavenly choir, 
 Lucifer bare a great fway , as being then one of the peculiar 
 favourites of thefe celeitial abodes; but he, contrary to that 
 duty he owed his heavenly Sovereign, with unbounded 
 ingratitude to his Divine Creator, not only envied him that 
 adoration which was his due, but thought toufurp that 
 throne, which he had neither power to keep, nor title to pre- 
 tend to. He raifed a diffenfion and civil war in Heaven, 
 and had a number of angels to take his pan. bnbounded 
 folly! ftupendous pride ! to hope for vidory, and afpire 
 above his powerful Creator ! The Deity, not fearful of iuch 
 an enemy, yet jaftly provoked at his Hellion, commif- 
 fioned his archangel Michael ft lead forth the heavenly hoft, 
 and give him battle; the advantage of which wasqu.ckly 
 perceived by Satan's being overthrown, and the prince or 
 the air, for fo the devii is called, with all h.s fallen a,- .els, 
 driven headlong into a difmal place which is called tiell. , - 
 The recital of this truth made my man give the gieateft 
 attention, and he exprefled a great (auction by l\\Z gCU, 
 lures, that God had (ent the devil into the deep hole. — 
 And then I defcred him to give great hted to what I had 
 further to fay. 
 
 No fooner, proceeded I, was God freed from, and the 
 Heaven clear of this arch-traitor, but-tiie Father fpeaks to 
 the Son and Holy Spirit, who belonged- to his eiTence, and 
 were equal to him in power and glory, Come let us make man, 
 faid he, in our own image, after our own iikenejs> Gen. i. 26\ 
 to have dominion ever the creatures of the world which we 
 have created. And theie he intended fliould glorify him 
 in Heaven, according to their obedience in this fUte of 
 probation on earth, which was, as it were,' to be the fchool 
 to train them up for thefe heavenly maniions. Now, Satan 
 feeing himfelf foiled, yet that God had not taken the power 
 from him as prince of the air, which power Heaven defign* 
 i ed he fhould retain, whereby his creatures might be tried ; 
 in revenge for the difgrace he had received, he tempts 
 Adam's wife, Eve, to talte of the tree of knowledge of good 
 and evil, which God had forbidden. He appears to her in 
 the fhape of a ferpent, then a moil beautiful creature, and 
 tells her that it was no better than an impofltion which God 
 had put upon her and her hufband, not to eat of that fair 
 
J(H LIF5 ANJ> AD-VENT U'ftE* 
 
 fruit wh'ch' he bad created, that the tafle thereof would 
 make them immortal like God hrmjelf; and consequently 
 as great and powerful as he. Upon which (he not only e t 
 thereof herfelf, but made her hnfband em alio, which brought: 
 them bofh nn$€t the heavenly difpleafure. 
 
 Here Friday txpu fled a great concern : " Ah, poor mans!" 
 cried he, " naughty womans ! naughty devi] ! make God not 
 ** lavs de mans, rrake mans like devil himfelf. ,> 
 
 Friday, faid I, God ftiil Joved mankind; -and though the 
 devil tempted human nature fo far* he would not fuffer him 
 to have an sfcfoloie povvifcr over them. I hive told you bs* 
 iore * f his ten ier love to his people, tili they, like Lucifer, 
 cifobeyed his commands an i rebelled againfl him ; and 
 even then, how Jefjs Chrift, his only Son, came to fave 
 iinners. But ftrll every man that live? in the world is un- 
 der temptation nnd trial. The Devil has yet a power, as 
 prince of the air, to fu^geft evil cogitations in our minds, 
 and prompt us on to wicked actions, that he might glory in 
 ©ur deftruction.  Whatever evil thoughts .we have, proceed 
 from him; fo that God, in this cur d?fr fs expects we 
 ihould appy < urfelves to him by fervent prayer for (pcedy 
 redrefs. He is not like Benamuckee, to let rone come near 
 him but Oo'xvakakee, but LfTers the people, as welj as prietfs, 
 to offer themfeives at his feet, thereby to be delivered irom 
 the power ana temptation of the d'vil. 
 
 But though at firft my man Friday 'exprt fled f: me con- 
 cern at the wi kednefs of Lucifer, I i : ou d it not fo eafy to 
 imprint the rght notions of him in hi mina, as it Wisab>ut 
 the divine e (Fence of God ; for there na.tire aiMed me in 
 all my arguments, to (how to him p a:nly the receffiiy of a 
 Great Firft Caufe, an overruling, governing Power ; of a 
 fee re i directing Providence, ana of the equity and reaion- 
 ablenefs of paying adoration to our Creaior ; whereas there 
 appeared nothing' of all this in the notion of an evil fj rit, 
 of his firft beginning, his nature, and, above ail, of hi* in- 
 clination to evil actions, and his power to temp us to the 
 )ike. And indeed this unlearned Indian, by the m«re force 
 of naiure, puzzled mc with one particular queftion, more 
 than ever I couid have expected. 
 
 1 had, it feems, one day, been talking to him of the om- 
 nipotent power of God, and his infv ite abhorrence of fin, 
 iafomuch that the Scriptures ftyled him a conjuming fire to 
 ali the wcrkers of iniquity ; and that it was in his power* 
 
 
 whenever he pleafed, to deftroy all the world in a moment, 
 the greater part of which are continually off-nding him. 
 
 When, with a ferious attention? he had liftened a great 
 while to what I faid, after I had been telling him how the 
 devil was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and ufed all 
 his malice and ikill to defeat the good defigns of Providence, 
 and deflroy the kingdom of" Chrift in the world, a~>d (o 
 forth : " Very well, Mailer," faid Friday, u you fay God is 
 41 fo (Iron?, fo great, is he not much ftrong, much mightier 
 4< than the- naughty devil !" To be fure, Friday, faid I, God 
 is more wife and flronger than the ferpent: he is above the 
 devil, which makes us pray to him, that he would tread down 
 Satan under his feet, enable us to refill the violent tempta- 
 tions, and quench his fiery darts. " Why then," anfwered 
 Friday quickly, " if God, as vou fay, has m 5ch lirong* much 
 *< might as the devil, why God no kill devil, make no more 
 ** tempt, no more do wicked. " 
 
 You may be certain I was ilrangely 4*urprifed atthequef- 
 t'on of my man's ; and^ though a.n old man, I was but a 
 young docor, and confequently very ill qualified for a ca- 
 fuili, or a refolver of intricate doubts of religion ; and as it 
 required fame time for me to ftudy for, an - anfoer, I pre- 
 tended not to hear him, nor to afk him what he faid ; but, 
 fo earned was he for an anfwer, as not to forget hivqjeflion, 
 which he repeated in the very fame broken word* as above. 
 When I had recovered myfeif a little.; Friday, faid 1, God 
 will at laft puniih him Severely, being referved for judg- 
 ment^ and is to be call into the bottomlefs pit, to remain im 
 frre everlafting* But all this dul not fatis fy Friday ; for 
 returning upon me, he repeated my words, (C reserve at 
 •'last, me no understand ; but, why not ki ! l devil now, 
 H not kill devil great, great. while ago :" Friday, faid I, you 
 may as well afk me why God does not kill you and me, 
 when, by our wicked actions, we fo much offended his divine 
 Majeity ? He gives us time to repent of our fins, that there- 
 by we may obtain pardon. At thefe words obtain pardon % 
 Friday mufed a great while; and, at laft, looking me ftead- 
 falllv in ihe face, " Well, well," faid he, " tha.'s very well—, 
 " fo you, T, devil, ail wicked mans, all preferve, repent, 
 "God pardon all." 
 
 Indeed, here I was run down to the lad extremity, when . 
 ii'became yery evident to me, how mere natural notions. 
 
 E.5 
 
 
 will guide reafonable creatures to the knowledge of a Deity, 
 and to the homage due to the Supreme Being of God ; but 
 however, nothing but divine revelation can form the know- 
 ledge of Jefus Chrift, and of a redemption purchafed for. 
 us, of the mediator of the new covenant, and of an inter- 
 ceilbr at the foolftool of God's throne; and, therefore, the 
 Gofpel of our Lord and Saviour Jefus Chrift ; that is, the 
 word and fpirit of God, promifed for the guide and fancti- 
 fier of his people, are his moil neceffary inftructers of the 
 fouls of men, in the faving knowledge of the Almighty, and 
 the means to attain eternal happtnefs. 
 
 And now I found it neceflary to put an end to this dif- 
 courfe between my man and me: for which purpofe I rofe 
 up hajftily, and made as if I had fome occafion to go out, 
 fending Friday for fomething that was a good way off. I 
 , then fell on my knees, and befecched God that he would 
 infpire me fo far as to guide this poor favage in the know- 
 ledge of Chriil, to anfwer his quefiions more clearly, that 
 his confeience mipht be convinced, his eyes opened, and 
 his foul faved. When he returned again, I entered into a 
 very long difcourfe with him, upon the fubject of the world's 
 redemption by the Saviour of it, and the doctrine of repent- 
 ance preached fronr> Heaven, together with an holy faith 
 of our blefled Redeemer Jefus Chnit ; and then I prrceeded 
 to explain to him, according to my weak capacity, the 
 reafon why cur Saviour lock not on h'm the nature of angels^ 
 but rather the (esd of Abraham : and how the fallen angels 
 had no benefit by that redemption ; and, laftly, that he came 
 only to the loft fheep of the houfe of lfrael, and the like. — 
 God knows I had more Sincerity than knowledge in all the 
 ways I took for the poor Indian's .instruction ; and I mull- 
 acknowledge what I believe every body that acts upon the 
 fame principle will find, that inlaying heavenly truths open 
 before him , I informed and itiftructed myfelf in many tnings 
 that either I did not know, or hd not perfectly cenfidered 
 bef re ; fa that, however, this poor creature might be im- 
 proved by my inductions, certain it is, that I myfelf had 
 great, reaion to be thankful to Providence for fending him 
 to me. His company allayed my grief, and made my ha- 
 bitation comfortable; and when I reflected that the foiitary 
 life to which I had been fo long confined, had made me to 
 look further towards Heaven, by making me the inftrument, 
 t-nder Providence, to fave theiife, and, for ought I know, 
 
 
 the foul of this poor favage, by bringing him to the know* 
 ledge of Jtfus Chrid, it cau fed a fee ret joy to fpread through 
 every part of my foul; and 'I frequently rejoiced, that ever 
 I was brought to this place, which I once thought the molt 
 miferable pa- 1 of the world. 
 
 In this thankful frame of mind did I afterwards continue 
 while I abode on the iflard, and for three years did my 
 man and I live in the gr ateft enjoyment of happinefs. In- 
 deed, I believe the lavage was as good a Chrittian as I ; 
 and I hope we were equally penitent ; and fuch penitents 
 as were comforted and reftored by God's Holy "Spirit : for 
 now we had the word of the Lord, f o inltruct us in the right 
 way, as much as if we had been on the finglifh more. 
 
 By the conftant application I made to the Scriptures, as 
 I read them to my man Friday, I earneilly endeavoured to 
 make him underfland every part of it, as much as lay in my 
 power. He a'fc, on the other hand, by his very ferious 
 quefti<.ns and inquiries, made me a much better proficient * 
 in Scripture kno ledge, than I fhould have been by my 
 own private reading and ftudy. I m.ulV not omit another 
 thing, proceeding from the experience I had in my retire- 
 ment : It wis t .at infinite and irexp v eiTibje biefling, the 
 knowledge of God through Jefus Chrift, which was fo plain 
 and t-afy to be. underftood, as immediately to direct me to 
 carry -on the great woj k of fincere repentance for my fins, 
 and laying kald of a Saviour for e ernal life, to a practical, 
 flated reformation, and obedience to ail God's inftkutions, 
 without the aiTilbnce. of a reverend and orthodox divine ; 
 and especially by this fame in; ruction, fo to enlighten this 
 lavage creature, as to make him fo good a €briftian, as very * 
 few could exceed him. And rnere was only this great thing 
 wanting, that I had no authority to adminifter the Holy Sa- 
 crament, that heavenly participation ;f Chrift's body and 
 blood ; yet, however, we relied ourfelves content, that God 
 would accept our defrres, and according to our faith, hava 
 mercy on us. 
 
 But wnat we wanted one way, was rande up in another, >» 
 and that was univerfel peace in our little church. We had - 
 • no difputes and wranglings about the nature and equality of * 
 the holy,, blefFed-, and undivided Trinity; no niceties in 
 doctrine, or fchemes. of church government; ro 4eur. or - 
 morofe difiemers to impofe more fublimated notions upon 
 us j no pedant fophifters to confound us with unintelligible 
 
 E6 
 
 
 inyfterlcs: but inftead of all this, we enjoyed the moft cer* 
 tain guide to Heaven ; that is, the word of God ; be fides 
 which, we had the comfortable views of his Spirit leading 
 us to the truth, and making us both willing and obedi?nt to 
 the inftruclion cf his word. As the knowledge and prac- 
 tice of this are the principal means of falvation, I cannot 
 fee what it avails any Chriftian church, or man in the world, 
 to aniufe bimfelj" with fpeculations and opinions, except it 
 be to difplay tbeir particular vanity and affectation. 
 
 You may well fuppofe, that, by the frequent difcourfe we 
 had together, ray man and I became moi* intimately ac- 
 quainted, and that there was but very Jit U that I could fay 
 but what Friday underftood ; and, indeed, he fpoke very 
 fluently, though it was but broken En^lim. J now took a 
 particular pleafure in relating all my adventures, efpec'ally 
 thofe that occured iince my being call on this ifland. I 
 made him underiland that wonderful myftery, as he cou- 
 ceived, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to 
 fhoot. 1 alfo preferred to him a knife, which peafed him 
 exceedingly, making him a belt, with a frog hanging there- 
 to, like thofe in which we wear hangers jn Engar-d ; and, 
 infteadof a hanger to put in the fr g, I gave htm a hatchet, 
 wh ; ch was not only as good, but even a better weapbii upon* 
 many occafions. In a word, my man thus accoutred, look- 
 ed upon himfelf as great as Don Quixote, when that cele- 
 brated champion went to combat the windmill. 
 
 J next pave him a very particular defcription of the ter- 
 ritories of Europe, and in a particular manner of Old Eng- 
 land, the place of my nativity. 1 laid before him the man- 
 ner of our worfhiping God, our behaviour cne to another, 
 and how we trade in fhips to every part of the univerfe. — 
 I then to)d him my misfbnunes in being fhipwrecked, mow- 
 ing, as near as I could, the place where the (hip lay, which 
 had been gone long before; but I brought him to the ruins 
 of my boat, which before my whole flrength could not Move, 
 but now was almoft rotten and fallen to pieces. I cbferved 
 my man Friday to view this boat with an uncommon cu- 
 ricfity ; which, when he had done, he ftc-d pondering a 
 great while, and faid nothing. At l«ft, faid I, Friday, what ' 
 makes you ponder fo much ? He replied, " O roaflet, mc 
 fee like boat come to place at my nation.. 11 
 
 It was fome time, indeed, before J understood what my 
 man- meant ; but examining ririctly into it, I plainly found, 
 
 
 that fuch another beat refembiing mine, had come upon the 
 country where he dwelt; that is to fay, by his farther explana- 
 tion, that the boat was driven there through flrefs of weather. 
 It then came into my mind that fome European fhip having 
 been caft away, the poor diftrefled creatures were forced 
 to have recourfe to the boat to. fave their lives ; and being 
 all, as 1 thought, drowned, I never concerned myfelf to aflc 
 any thing concerning them, but my only inquiry was about 
 the boat, and what defcrption my man could give of it. 
 
 Indeed, Friday anfwered my demands very well, making 
 every thing very [lain to my underftanding ; but beyond 
 meafure was I fatisfied, when he told me with s;reat warmth 
 and ardour, '* O mafter, we favp white mans from drown ;** 
 upon which 1 immediately a&ed him, if there were any 
 white man?, as he called them, in the boat? * 4 Yes, yes," 
 faid he, " the boat full, very full of white mans." How 
 many, Friday? faid L Flereupon he numbered his fingers, 
 and counted feventeen. And when I afked him what be* 
 came of the?) all, and whether they lived or not? he replied 
 -i Yes, matter, they all live, they be live among my nation. " 
 This information put frefh thoughts into my head, that thefe 
 muit be thofe very men who before 1 concluded had been 
 fwallowed up i*> the ocean, after thev had left the ihip, that 
 had itruck upon the rocks of my kingdom, and a'ter efca- 
 ping the fury of the deep, landed upon the wild more, and 
 committed thrrnfdves to the fury of the devouring Indians. 
 
 Tne manner of their cruelties to one another, *hich con- 
 fequently, as I thought, mud be ac~ied with great barbarity 
 ta Grangers, created in me a great anxiety, and made me 
 ilill more curious to afk Friday concerning them. He to!d 
 me, he was fure they ilill lived there, having redded among 
 them above four years, and that the favages gave them vic- 
 tuals to live upon ; But pray, Friday, faid I, whence pro- 
 ceeded ail this good r^ture and ^enerofitv? Ho<v e^me it 
 to pafs that they did not kill and eat them, to pleafe their 
 devouring appetites, and occaficn fo fplendid an en ertain- 
 ment among the n ? «« No, no," faid Friday, *< tney not kill 
 'em, they make brothers with 'em;" by which I underft >od 
 there was a truce between them. And then I had a more 
 favourable opinion of the Indians, upon Friday uttering 
 thefe words : •« My nation, t'oth-r nation no eat nans, but 
 when mans m*ke war fight;" as though he had faid, that 
 neither thofe cf his kingdom, nor anjr other nations that he 
 
 
 knew of, ever ate their-fellow creatures, but fuch as their 
 law of arms allowed to be devoured ; that is thofe rmfera- 
 able captives, whofe misfortune it mould be to be made pri- 
 foners of war. 
 
 Soiree confiderable time after, upon a very pleafant day, 
 in moil ferene weather, my man and I flood upon the top 
 of a hill, on the eaft fide of the ifland, whence 1 had once 
 before beheld the continent of America. I could not tell 
 immediately what was the matter; for fad den ly Friday fell 
 a. jumping and dancing as if he had been mad; and upon 
 my demanding the reafon of his behaviour, " O joy/' fdd 
 he," O glad ! there fee my country, there my nation, there 
 if live white mans gether/* And indeed fuch a rapturous 
 fenfe of pleafure appeared in his countenance, that his eyes 
 had an uncommon fparklingand brightnefs, and fuch a 
 flrange eagemefs, as if he had a longing defire to be in his 
 country again. This made me not fo well fatisfied with 
 my man Friday as before; .for by this appearance, I made 
 no difpute, but that if he cou-d get back thither again, he 
 would not only be. unmindful of what religion I had taught 
 him, but likewise of the great obligation he owed me for 
 his wonderful deliverance; nay, that he would not only in- 
 form his countrymen of me, but accompany hundreds or them 
 to my kingdom, and imke n e. a miferable facrificc, like 
 thofe unharpy wretehes taken in battle. 
 
 Indeed I was very much to blame to have thofe cruel and-. 
 unjuil iufpicions, and mud freely own 1 wronged the poor 
 creature vtry much, who was of a quite contrary .temper. 
 
 And had he had that difcerning acutenefs which many Eu- 
 ropeans have, he would certainly hive perceived my coldr- * 
 nefs and indifference, and alfo have been very much con- > 
 cerned upon that account : as 1 was now mare circumfpect, 
 I had much lefTened my kindnefs and familiarity with him# 
 and while this jealoufy continued, I ufed that arriul way- > 
 (now too much in fafliion, the occalion of ftrife and diffen- 
 fior) c£ pumping him daily, thereby :o difcover whether he < 
 was deceitfui in his thoughts and inclinations; but ce; thinly < 
 he had nothing.in him but what was confident with the beft 
 principies, botn as a religious Chriftianand a grateful friend; * 
 and, indeed, I found ev&ry thing he faid wa>. ingenuousand 
 innr.cent, that I had no room ,ior fufpicipn, and, in fpite of . 
 all uneafineis, he not only made me entirely his.own again, 
 but alfo caufed me much to lament that I ever conceived 
 cne ill thought of him. 
 
 
 As we were walking up the fame hill another day, when 
 the weather was fo hazy at fea, that I could not perceive 
 the continent, Friday, faid, I, don't you wiih vourfelf to be 
 in your own country, your nation, among )Our eld friends 
 and acquaintances V ,l Yes,** faith he, " me much O glad to 
 " be at my own nation." And what would ycu do there, 
 Friday ? Would you turn wild again, eat man's flelh, and 
 be as lavage as you were formerly ? «' No, no," (anfwered 
 he, full of concern, and ihaking his head) '* Friday now tell 
 *' them to live gcod,tell them pray God, tell them to eat 
 V corn, bread, cattle, fiefh, milk, no eat man again." But 
 furely, replied 1, if you fhould offer to do all this, they will 
 kill you ; and to ma^ifeft their contempt of fuch intfrudion 6 
 cat you up when they have done. He then put on a grave* 
 yet innocent and fmocth counienar.ee, faying, " No, they 
 u no kill me, they willing live learn;" thit is, that they 
 would be very willing to learn : adding withal, *' t« at they 
 •! had learned much of the bearded mans that came in the 
 u boat." Will you, faid I, go back again, Friday ? He 
 fmiied at that, and told me, that he could not fwim fo far., 
 But, faid I, I will make a canoe for you* " Yes, mailer," 
 faid he, u me go if you go ; me no go, if you ilay." I go, 
 Friday! why would you have them to eat me up, and de- 
 vour your kind mailer? "No, no," faid he, ti me make 
 ** them not eat mafter, and me make them much love you;" 
 that is, he would tell them how I had (lain his enemies, ani 
 thereby faved his life, for whichreafon he would make them 
 love me:' and then he relaxed to me, as well as h^ was able, 
 ho-v exceedingly kind thofe of his nation were to the white, 
 or bearded men, as he called them, who, in their great cala- 
 mity, were driven into their country. 
 
 It was from this time., indeed, I had ftrong inclinations to 
 venture over, and ufe my ucmoft efforts, if poffiblr, to join 
 thefe white bearded men, who undoubtedly were Spaniards 
 Of Porcugu fe; for, thought I, it muft certainly be a better, 
 and fafer way to efcape when there is a good company, tiian 
 for me alone, from an ifland forty miles off the ; ihore, ani 
 without ani affillance. Some days aU-r, Friday and L be- 
 ing at work, *s ufual, at the fame time diverting ourfelves 
 with various di-courfes, I told him I had a baat which I 
 would beftjw upon him, whenever he pleafed to return to* 
 his own nation; and to convince him of the truth of what i 
 faid, I took him with me to the o;her fide of the iiland, where 
 
 
 my frigate lay, and then taking it from under the water, (far 
 I always kept it funk for fear of a dlfcovery,) we went both 
 into it to fee how it would manage fuch on expedition. 
 
 'And really never could any be more dexterous in rowing 
 than my faithful fervant, making the boat go as faft again as 
 I could. Well now, Friday, faid I, fhall we now go to 
 your fo much admired nation ? But initead of meeting with 
 that cheerfulnef? I expected, *he looked very dull and me- 
 lancholy at my faying fo ; which indeed at hVft furp ifed me, 
 till he made me fenfible ''that his concern was about 
 the boat being too fmall to go (o far a voyage. . Upon 
 which I let him underlland I had a much bigger; and, ac- 
 cordingly, the next day went to the place where the fir ft 
 boat lay, which I had made, when all the flrength I had, or 
 art I could ufe, failed me in my attempt to get it into the 
 water: but now it having Iain in the fun two and twenty 
 years, and no care being taken of it all that while, it became 
 in a manner ro ten. My m^n told me, that fuch a trpat 
 would do very well for the purpofe> . fufficient to carry 
 enough <vittle, drink, bread, for that was his manner of talking. 
 In fhort, my mind being flron^ly fixed upon my defigns of 
 froing over with him to (he Continent, Ivery plainly told 
 him that we would both go and make a. bent full as big, and 
 more proportionable than that, wherein he might fafeiy re*- 
 turn to his' own nation. 
 
 Thefe words made Friday look fo very penfive, that I 
 thought he would ha-^ fallen at my (eet. Ir was fome time 
 before he could fp*?ak a, word, whicr» made me afk him what 
 was the matter with him? He replied, in a very foft and 
 moving tone, <J What has poor Fridav done ? why are you 
 u angry, mad wih poor fervant? What me done, O what- 
 " me done?" Friday, faid I, you never yet have offended 
 me, what makes you think I am angry with you-, when I am- - 
 nGt anory at all. "You no angry, no angry," faid he,feverai' 
 limes; « f if you be no angry, why den fend Friday over 
 " great water to my o*n nation ?" Why finely, Friday, an- 
 fwered I, did not you wifh to be there, when from a moun- 
 tain you beheld the place where you was born ? and is it 
 not to fatisfy your defies that I am wiling to give you 
 leave to return thither?" Yes, ves, " faid Friday, "me wifh 
 "to be there, fure enough, but then me wifh mailer there- 
 u too: no wifh Friday there, n) mafter there/' In fhorr, 
 kt could not endure the thoughts of going' there without me. 
 
 
 I go there! Friday, faid I, what (hall I do there? He an- 
 fwered very q ickly, 'Q mailer, v.m do great deal much 
 « ; good, vou teach all de wild man* to be good tame mans: 
 u you le^rn dm tu be fober, live good life, tok^ow God, 
 "and pray God." Alas! poor Friday, faid I, what can I 
 do again d their p»i?fts of Be^amuckee, or indeed what 
 good can I make your nation fenfible of, when I rnyfelf am 
 but a poor ignorant mar'? "No. n •, mailer, " faid he, "you 
 "be no ignorant, you teachee me go^d, you teach'e dem 
 "good." Ycu (hail go without me, Friday, faid I, fori 
 doirr care to accompany you thither; I wodd rather live 
 in this folitude than venture among £ich in mman favages. 
 Go your way, fince you defre it, and leave m: alone by 
 jnvfelf, as I was before I faved your life. 
 
 Never was any creature acre thunderdruck thin Friday 
 was at thefe words. i( Go me away, leave rrfaler away/' 
 /aid he, after along (ilence, '• no, no, Friday die, Friday live 
 €t not mailer gone," as though he had faid, I neither can 
 nor will live, if my matter fends me from him. And here I 
 cannot but take notice of the drong ties of friendship, which 
 many tir.es furpafs thofe of co -tang^inity : For often we 
 find a /rest disagreement among kindred ; and when there 
 is any feeming regard for each other, it is very feldom true, 
 and fcarce ever lading, if powerful inhered does not bear 
 the f*av; and that alone is often the occafion of the g seat- 
 ed hatred in the world, whicn is to deiire the death of pa- 
 rents and relations, for the fake of acquiring their fortunes. 
 But there was no fuch thing between my fervar,t and me; 
 inftead of which there was the g reared gratitude and the 
 mod fincere love; he found me not only his deliverer, but 
 his preferver and comforter; not a (evere and cruel tvranr, 
 but a kind, loving, and affable friend. He wanted for no 
 manner of fudenance; and when he was ill or cut of order, 
 ] was his phyiician, not only for his body but his foul; and 
 therefore no wonder was it, that fuch an innocent creature, 
 Jong fince diverted of his former natural cruelty, fbould have 
 an uncommon concern at fo cruel a feparation from me, 
 which pierced him to the very foul, and made him defire 
 even to die, rather than iive without me. 
 
 Aftejr 1 had told Friday, in a very carelefs manner, that 
 
 he fliould be at liberty as foon as the boat was made, the 
 
 'language of his eyes expredVd all imaginable confalion; 
 
 when, immediately running to one of his hatchets, waich he 
 
Il# I/1FE ANB a irvE'NTU'R'E je- 
 
 llied to wear "as a de fen five weapon, he gives it into my* 
 hand, with a hear: fo foil, that he cculd fcarcely fpeak.-*- 
 Friday, fa'^d I, what is it you mean? What mutt 1 do with 
 this ? "Only kill Friday, V faid he, •* Friday care mot live 
 **long." " But what mu4} I kill you for ?" replied I again. 
 ** Ah ! dear mailer, what .made you Friday fave^from eat a^ 
 "me up, ib keep long Friday, make Friday, love God/ and 
 "love not Benamutkee, and now Friday fend away ; never 
 "fee Friday more*" As though the poor creature had faid, 
 Alas ! my deaieit kkd mailer, how comes it to pafs, that 
 after having ventured your precious life to fave mc from the 
 jaws of devouring cannibals, like iriyfelf, after fuch a tender 
 regard to provide for me fuch comfortable r;ounfhment, 
 and continuing fo long a kind matter, andamoft iincere 
 friend; and afier making me for fake the falfe notion of an 
 Indian deity, and worfhip the true God in fp*ri't- and in 
 truth; ar.d after ail this, how comes it now, that you are 
 wi ling to fend me away to my former courie of living, by 
 *vhich meats undoubtedly we fhall be dead ir. each other; 
 but greater mufirbe my misfortune, that I fhall never behold 
 xny befl friend I have in the world anymore. And this un- 
 doubtedly, though he could not exprefs himfelf fo clearly, 
 muft be his fentiments ; for the, tears ran down his cheeks 
 in fuch a plentiful manner, that I had much ado to refrain from 
 weeping alio, when I beheld the poor creature's affection ; 
 fo fthat I was forced to comfort him in. the befl manner I 
 cculd, which I did by telling him, if he was content to abide 
 with me, 1 mould be ever willing to keep him. 
 
 After Friday's grief was fomewhat abaied^ more fully to 
 convince me of hia affection, he faid, u O matter, me not 
 <f care to be in my nation, leave you here : Me defire nation* 
 41 learn good, that's all ; r> meaning, that his defirewas for the 
 converfion of that barbarous people. But as 1 had no apof- 
 tolic miilion, nor any concern about their falvatton, fo I 
 had not the lealt intention or defife of undertaking it ; and 
 the ftrength of my inclination, in order to efcape, proceed* 
 ed chiefly from my late difcourfe with Friday, about thefe 
 feventeen white bearded men, that had been driven upon 
 the barbarian coait, whom I deiigned to join as the only 
 means to further our efcape. To which intent my man 
 and I went to fearch for a proper tree to fell, whereof we 
 might make a large perigua or canoe, to urdertake the voy- 
 age; and, indeed, we were not long in finding one fit for 
 
 
 Our purpofe, there b~in£ enough of wood in the idand to 
 have built a fleet of large vefTels; but the thing we princw 
 p*l!v . v anted, was o get one Co near the Water, that we 
 might launch it after it was nrlihed, and not commit fa 
 horrid a mill ke as I had dene once before. 
 
 -Well, after a great fearch for what was bed and mofl 
 convenient, Friday, at laft, whofe judgment in fuch affiirs 
 was roach fuperror to mine, pitches upon a kind of wood 
 toe moil fisting {or ir. To this day I cannot tell the name 
 of the tree, nor defcribe ic an/ othtt way, thin only by fay* 
 ing, that it is very like what we call /uflie, or between that 
 and tne Niacaragua w r od, being much of the fame colour 
 and fmell. But though my man exceeded me in my know- 
 ledge of the moft proper tree, yet I ihowed him a much 
 better and clearer way to make a canoe than ever he knew' 
 before; for he was for burning tne hollow or cavity o'fths 
 tree, in order to make this boat ; but i ihsn told him how he 
 might do it with tools, learning him atche fa^ne time how 
 to ufe them, which indeed he did very dexierouily ; fo that 
 in a month's time we finiihed it, making it very handfome 
 by cutting the oatfide in the true (hapc of a beat. After' 
 this it took us a full fortnight before we coaid get her into 
 the water, which we did as it were inch by inch, upon great 
 rollers; but when ihe was in, foe would have carried twen- 
 ty men, witi* ail the eafe imaginable. 
 
 As I was v*ry well pleafed, you may be fur?, at the 
 launching of this man of war of mine, 1 was no lefs amazed 
 to b hoid with what dexterity my man would manage her* 
 turn her 9 a-d paddle her along. Well, Friday, fa^d I, what 
 do you think of it now? Do yeu think this will carry us 
 over? " Yes, malier," iaid he, "me venture over well, 
 *' though great blow wind.'** But my defign was yet far- 
 ther, which he was infenfiale of; and that was to make a 
 mail and a fail, and to provide her with an anchor and 
 cable. As to a malt, that was no difficult thing at all to 
 procure; fo i fixed upon a ftraight y ung cedar-tree, which 
 I found near the place, great plenty of it abounding in the 
 ifland ; and fetting Friday to cut it down, I gave him parti- 
 cular directions how to fhape and order it; but as to the 
 fail, that I managed myfelf. I very well knew 1 had fome 
 old ones, or pieces cf fails enough, which had lain fix and 
 twenty yrars by me; but not being careful to prefervc them* 
 as thinking I lhould have no occafion to tsfe them any more. 
 
 
 when I came to overlook them, I found them alrhoft all 
 rotren, except two; and with thefe 1 went to work, and 
 afte? a great deal of pains arid .awkward tedious. Hitching 
 for want of n?ed ! es, at length I finiihed a thrce-c rnered 
 ugly th'ng, like what we call in England a moulder of mm- 
 ion fail, to go with a boom at bottom; and a little fmal' fork, 
 at the top, like thole which our long-boats ufe, and wh'ch 
 I very well knew how to manage, especially (ince it was- 
 like that which 1 had in my patron's fifhing-boat, when* 
 with my hoy Xiuy, 1 made my eicape from the barbarian 
 /bore. 
 
 It was near two months, I think, before I completed this 
 work, that is, the riegjng and fitting my mads and fails * 
 and indeed they were nicely done, having made a f ma 11 flay 
 and a fail or a forefail to it, to.afM, if we mould turn to 
 the weftwardi and, what is ftill more, I fixed a rudder to. 
 the Rem of her, to fleer with; and though I was bus a very- 
 indirTerent Shipwright, yet, as I was (enuole o^ the great 
 ufefulnefs and abfolute necefiity of a thing like this, I ap- 
 plied m>felf to it with fuch ccnflant application, that I at 
 laft accorop'iihed my deiign ; but what with the many dull 
 contrivances I had about it, and the failure of many things,, 
 it cofl me as much pains in ordering as in making the boat* 
 Betides, when all this was done, Ihad my man to teach „ 
 what belonged to its navigation; for though he very well 
 underftood how to paddle a canoe along, he was an utter 
 ilra^ger to a fail and a rudder, and was amased when he 
 iaw me work th© boat to and again in the fea, by them, and 
 how the fail gi'pbed and filled this way or that way, as the, 
 courfe we failed changed- After fome time and a litcie . 
 ufe, I made all thefe things very familiar to him, fo that he 
 became, an expert failor, except in relation to the csmpafs^ 
 and that I could make him underhand but little of. But as 
 it happened, there was. feldom occalion for it, the re being 
 but little cloudy weather, and fcarce any fo^ in thofe parts; 
 the flars were always vilible in the night, and the more 
 perfpicuous by day, except in the rainy feafon, which, con- 
 fined every one to his habitation. Thus entered in the 
 feven and twentieth year of my reign, or captivity, which 
 you pleafe, (the laft three of which, bleffed with the com- 
 pany of my msn Friday, ought not to be reckoned,) I kept 
 the anniverfary of my landing here, with the fame thank- 
 fulnefs to God, for his tender mercies, as. I did before ; and 
 
 
 fctatainly as I had grea4 caufe for a thankful acknowl -dg- 
 i merit fo^ mv deliverance at fir it. [hid mich greater now 
 for fjch irruu'a aid additional tcflim ie- t the care of 
 P : viderce over me, in all my'di rt/Tcs of bo<h bo y and 
 mmd, and the great hopes I had of being eifectuaTy and 
 ipeedily delivered ; for I had a tfrong iropreffibri upo^ my 
 mind, that I mould not be anot r e* year in hh i-fland. But, 
 however, I ftill continued on with my huibaidry, digging, 
 planting, and fencing, as ufual ; gathering and eating my 
 grapes, and doing all other things that were neccflary. 
 
 And now the ramy feafo : beginning to come on, obliged 
 me to keep the longer within doors; but before this, [ brought 
 my new vtilel into the creek, where I had landed my rafts 
 from the {hip, and hailing her up to the mors, I crderea rny 
 man Friday to dig a dock fuffieient to hold her in, and d^€p 
 enough to give her water, wherein me might float; and 
 then when the tide was out, we made a firing dam acrofs 
 the end of if, to keep out the water; by which means (lie 
 Jay dry, as to the tide from the fea; and to keep the rain 
 from her, we thatched her over, as it were, with boughs or* 
 trees, like a houfe, fo we waited for the months of Novem- 
 brr and December, in which I deS^ned to venture ever the 
 ocean. 
 
 No fooner did the feafonable weather begin to draw 
 ne,:r, but fo much was I elevated with this ne>v defined 
 adventure, that I daily prepared for the voyage. The firir, 
 thir.g ] thougnt on was, ro lay by a certain quantity of pro* 
 tin on?, as a fufnetent ilore for fuch an exped tion, intend- 
 ing in a week or fortnights tire to open she dock, and fo 
 launch out the boat for that purpefe. But one morning as I 
 Was very bufy upon fomething ncceffary for this cccaiion, 
 I called Friday to me, and bid him go to the fea-ihore, and 
 ice if he could find a turtie or tortoife, a thing which we 
 commonly had once a week, as much upon account of the 
 eggs, as fcr the fake of the Heih. He had not been long 
 gone, but re came running back, as though he was uriued 
 for lie, and, as it were, flew over my outer wall, or fence, 
 like one that felt not the ground^ or had Heps to fet his feet oil, 
 and befoie f had time to inquire the reafon of his precipi- 
 tation, he cries out, ' 4 C> dear Matter, O -for row, farrow ! 
 "BM-'l O badP' Why whit's the -'matter, Fridajr, faid I. 
 M O yonder, yonder !*' iaid he, " there be one, t vo, or three 
 ^canoes! two three I" Surely thought I, ijhcre mud be 
 
 
 fix, by my man's way of reck ning; but on a flricter 
 inquiry, I found there were but three. Well, Friday, faid I, 
 don't be terrified, I warrant you we will nor only defend 
 ourfelves againfi them, but kill the mod of ihefe cruel fa- 
 vages But though I comforted him in the beft manner I 
 could the poor creat re trembled fo, that I fcarce knew 
 what to do with him: "O matter/' faid he '"they come look 
 4i Friday, cut pieces Friday, cut a me up." Why, Friday, 
 faid I, they will eat me up as well as you, and my danger is 
 as great as yours. But fifiCe it is fo, we muft refolve to 
 fight for our lives. What fay you ? Can you fight, Friday ? 
 •' Yes," faid he, very faintly, ft me fhoet, me kill what I 
 1i can, but 'here come a great many number.** That's no 
 matter, faid I again, our guns will terrify thofe we do not 
 kill ; I am very willing to Hand by you to the laft dro*. of 
 my blord. Now tell me if you will do the like by me, and 
 obey my orders in whatsoever I command ? Friday then 
 anfvvered, f« O mailer, me lofe life for ou, me die when 
 ** you bid die." Thus concluding all queftions concerning 
 his fidelity, immediately I fetched him a good dram of rum, 
 (of which I had been a very good hufbard,) and gave it him 
 to comfon his heart. After he had drank it, I orcered him 
 to take the two fowling-pieces, which we always carried, 
 and loaded them with large fwan fhot, as b*g as frmli piitol 
 bullets; then I took four mufkefs, and loaded tnem with 
 two (lugs; and five imaU burets each, charging- my two 
 pi(loIs each with a brace ; I hung my great fword, as cuf- 
 tornary, n ked to my lide, and £ave Friday his hatchet, as a 
 inoft excellent weapon for defer.ee. 
 
 Thus prepared, I thought as well of myfelfas any knight- 
 errant thatcver handled a fword and fpear. I took my per- 
 frective glafs, and went up ?o the fide of the hi l, to fee 
 what I could difcover ; and T perceived very focn, by my 
 glafs, that there were one and twenty favages, three prifoners, 
 and three canoes, and that their chief concern teemed to 
 be the triumphant banquet upon the three poor human 
 bodies, a thing which by th«s time I had obferved was very 
 common with them. I alfo remarked, that they d'd not 
 land at that place from whence Friday made his elcape, but 
 nearer to the creek, where the (bore was low, and where a 
 thick wood came very c.ofe to the tea, IVly foul was then 
 filled with indignation and abhorrence at fuch inhuman, 
 wretches, which put a period to all my former thoughts in 
 their vindication, neither would I give myfelf time to con- 
 
 
 fider their right of conqueflyas'I had clone before : but de- 
 scending from the mountain, I came down to Fridav, and 
 told htm I as refoived to go fpeediiy to them, and kill 
 them all; alking him again, in the fame breath, if he would 
 lVand by me : when by this time being recovered from his 
 fright, and his fpirits much cheered with the dram I had 
 given him, he -was very pieafant, yet (erioufly telling me, 
 as he did before, Cj When Ibid die, he vould die." 
 
 And now it was, havi g fixed my refolution in fo ftrong 
 a manner, that nothing could divert my bread of its uncom- 
 mon fery, I immediately divided the loaded arms betwixt 
 us. To my man Fridav I gave a piftol to (tick in his gir- 
 dle, with three guns upon his {boulder, a weight too great, 
 I confefs, to bear ; but what muil a poor ki*fg do, who had 
 but one foldier in the world? But to fhow I mad^ him bear 
 
 ^o more than what I would lay on myfelf, I iiuck the other 
 piftol in my girdle, and the other three guns up m my 
 moulders; nay, fomcthing more, but that was like iEfrp's 
 burden, a fmall bott'e of rum, which was f^on lightened to 
 our exceeding re fre foment. Thus we rr arched out, under 
 a ponderous load of armour, like two invincible champions, 
 with a qi>amity of powder and bullets to ftard our battle, 
 and load again when the p ; eces were discharged. And 
 
 i now my orJers being to be obeyed, 1 charged Friday to 
 keepclofe behind me, and not to fijr, or (hoot, or attempt 
 any thirsg til! I commanded him; and in the interim, not to 
 fpeivk fo much as one word. It was in this order I fetched 
 a ccmpafs to the right hand, of near a mile, as well to get 
 
 ; over the creek, as to attain the wood ; and by this I thought 
 to come within foot of them before I could be difcerned, as 
 
 1 I found, by my glafs, would not be difficult to accomplifo. 
 But how fickle and wavering is the mind of men, even in 
 
 I our greateft fury and ftrongeft inclinations! For while I 
 
 | was taking this march, my refolution began to abate, not 
 
 ! through fear of their numbers, who were a parcel of naked 
 unarmed wretches, but thofe reflexions occurred to my 
 
 ! thoughts: what power was I commiflioned with, or what 
 ©ccafion or htceffity had I to go and imbrue my hands in 
 human blood, and murder people that had neither done, nor 
 intended to do, me any wrong? They wore innocent in 
 particular as to me; and their barbarous cuflom was not 
 only their misfortune, but a fign that God had left them in 
 the mod immenfe fiupidity; but yet did not vvarrant me to» 
 
 
 be a judge of their action 5 ?, much iefs an executioner of his 
 righteous judgments : That, on the contrary, whenever he 
 thought ht, he would take vergcaace oh t em hirHelf, and 
 purifh thtm in a » rat nal way;, recording to t heir national 
 crimes ; but this v*q& nothing as ail t me, who hart n con- 
 cern with them. Izdeed my man Friday might juftiTy hirn- 
 felf, becaufe they were his declared enemies, oi tnat very 
 fame nation that went to facrifice him before ; and, indeed, 
 it was lawful for him to attack them, which I could not fay 
 was fo with refpect to me. So warmly did thefe things prefs 
 upon my thoughts ail the way 1 went, that 1 only refolved 
 to place myfelf fo as to behold their bloody entertainment 
 without falling upon them, except fomething more than or- 
 dinary, by God's fpecial direction, mould oblige rr.e thereto. 
 Thus fixed in my refolution, 1 entered into the thick wood, 
 (my man Friday following me clofe behind,) when with all 
 poflible warireis and filence, I marched till I came to the 
 fkut of it, on that fide which was the neareft to them ; for 
 only ore end of the wood interpofed between me and them* 
 Upon which J called very foftly to Friday, and mewing him 
 h great tree, that was jufVat thectrner or the wood, I or- 
 dered him to repair thither, and bring me word if he could 
 plainly perceive their actions; accordingly he did as I com- 
 manded him, fend came back with this melancholy fiery, 
 that they were all about treir fire, eating the fleth oi one of 
 their prifoi^rs; and that another lay bound upon the fand, 
 at a little diilante from them, when they deiigned for the 
 next facrifict, and this he told me was not one cf their na- 
 tion, but one of thefe very bearded irun, who were driven 
 by a dorm into their country, ard of whom he had io often 
 talked to me abcut. You may be Aire, that upon hearing this, 
 my foul was ready to link within me ; when, afcerding into 
 a tree, I favv plainly by my glafs, a white man, who lay upoa 
 the beach of the fea, with his hands and feet tied with flags, 
 cr things refembling rufhes, being covered with clothes, 
 ard (tened to be an European. From the tree whe e I took 
 this profpeel, I perce ved ano her tree and a thicket beyond 
 if, about, lifty yards neaser to them than where I was, winch, 
 by taking a lmall circle round, 1 night corne at undiscovered, 
 and then I mould be within half a fhot of thefe devourcrs. 
 .And this confederation alone, to be mo>e perfect] y revenged 
 upon them, made me withhold my pafficn, though 1 was 
 enraged to ibe higheft degree imaginable ; when going 
 
 
 back about twenty paces, I got behind fome bullies, which 
 held all the way tii( I came to the other tree , and then £ 
 afcended to a little rifmg gound, not above eighteen yjards 
 di fiance, and there 1 had a full view of thefe creatures, and 
 I Ciuld perceive all their actions. 
 
 Such a Tight did then appear as obliged me not to lofe 
 a moment's time. No lefs than nineteen of thefe dreadful 
 wretches fat upon the ground, clofe middled together, ex- 
 preffing all the delight imsgirab!e at fo birbarous an en- 
 tertainment; and they had juit lent the other two to murder 
 this poor unhappy Chrilhan, and bring him l ; mb by limb 
 to their fire; for they were then juft going to untie the ' 
 bands from bis feet in crder for deitn, as fetters are knock- 
 ed off the feet of malefactors before they go to the place cf 
 execution. Hereupon, immediately turning to my man, 
 now, Friday^ faid i, mind what I. fay, fail in nothing, but 
 do exa^lly as ycu fee me do. All whxh he promifiog he 
 would pet form, 1 fet down one of my mufkets and fowling- 
 piece upon the ground, and Friday did the fam.e by his; and 
 with the other muflcet i took my aim at the favages, bidding 
 him do the like: Are you ready ? faid I: " Yes, matter/' 
 faid he; why then fire at the.n, faid I; and that very mo- 
 ment 1 gave fire likewife. 
 
 I only killed one and wounded two; but my man Friday* 
 taking his aim much better than I, killed two and wounded 
 three. You may be fure they were in a dreadful confle.-na- 
 tion at fuch an unexpected difaller, and tho e who had yet 
 efcaped our penetrating (hot, immediately jumped upon 
 their feet, but were in luch a coniution, that they knew not 
 which w£y to run or kok, not knowing fron whence their 
 deftrudlion came. We threw down our pieces and took up 
 o-hers, giving a fecond dreadful volley , but as they were 
 loaded only vith (wan ibot, or fmaiJ piitol bul!e:s, we per - 
 Ceived only two of them fall; though many were wounded, 
 who ran y tiling and fcreuming ab ut Ike mad creatures. 
 Now, Friday, iaid I, lay down >our piece, and take up the 
 mufket, and follow me. He dia fo, with great courage; 
 when, fhowing our (elves to the favages, we gave a great 
 ihout, and made dircttly to the poor vi&im, who would 
 have been facrificed had rot cur fir ft fire obliged tht butch- 
 ers, with three others, to jump into a canoe. By my order 
 Friday fired at them, at which (hot i thought he had killed 
 them ail, by reafon of their falling to the bottom of the boatj 
 
 F 
 
 
 however, he killed two, and mortally wounded a third. Tn 
 the mean time, I cut the fla^s that tied the hands and feet 
 of the paor creature, and lifting him up, aflcd him in the 
 Portuguefe tongue, What be was P He anfwered me in Latin, 
 Chriftianus ; but fo very weak and faint, that he could fcarce 
 ftar.d or fpeak. Immediately I gave htm a dram, and a 
 piece of bread to cherifti him, and afked him what country- 
 man he was ? He faid'Hifpamola, and then utte r ed all the 
 thankfulnefs imaginable for his deliverance. Seignior, faid f, 
 with as much Spaniih as I was mailer of, let us talk after- 
 wards, but fight now ; here take this faord and piftol/and 
 do what ycu can, And, indeed, he did fo with fuch cou- 
 rage and intrepidity, that he cut two cf them in pieces in 
 an inftant/the favages not having the power to fly for their 
 lives. 1 ordered Friday to run for thofe pieces a e had left 
 at the tree, which he brought me with great fwiftnefs, and 
 then I gave him my mufket, while I loaded the reft. But 
 now there happenfd a fierce encounter between the Spani- 
 ard and one of the lavages who had made at him with one 
 of their wooden fiords ; and though the firmer was as 
 brave as could be expe&ed, having twice wounded his ene- 
 my in the -head, yet beirg weak and fain-, the Indian had 
 thrown him upon the ground, and was wrefting my (word 
 out of his hands, wnich the Spaniard very wifely quitting, 
 drew out his piitol and (hot him through the body before I 
 xouldcome rear him, though I was running to his a/finance. 
 As for Friday, he purfued the flying'^ wretches with his hatch- 
 et, difpatching three, but the rcil were too nimble for him. 
 The Spaniard taking one of the fowling-pieces, wounded 
 two, who running into the wood, Friday purfued and killed ; 
 but the other, notwithftanding his wounds, plunged himfelf 
 into the fea, and fwam to thofe who were left in the canoe, 
 which, with one wounded, were all that efc^ped oat of one 
 and twenty. The account is as follows :

 The favages in the canoe worked very hard to get out 
 of our reach, and Friday was as eager in purfuing them ; 
 and indeed I was no lefs anxious about their efcape, left, 
 after the news had been carried to 'their people, they fhould 
 return in multitudes and deiiroy us. So being refolved to 
 purfue them, I jumped into one of their canoes, and bid 
 Friday follow me ; but no fooner was I in, than, to my fur* 
 prife, I found another poor creaure bou-nd hand arid foot 
 for the Slaughter, juft as the Spaniard had been, with -very 
 little life in him. Immediately I unbound him, and would 
 have helped hi*n up, but he could neither fbnd nor fpeak, 
 but groaned To piteoufly, as thinking he was only unbound 
 in order to be {lain. Hereupon I bid Friday fpeak to Mid; 
 and tell him of his deliverance; when pulling- out my 
 bottle, I made the poor wretch drink a dram, which, with 
 the joyful news he had received, fo revived his heart, that 
 he fat up in the boat. As Toon as Friday began to hear h\m 
 fpeak, and look more fully in his face, it would have moved 
 any one to tears to perceive h's -uncommon transports ot 
 joy; for he killed, embraced him, hugged him, cried, 
 laughed, halooed, jumped about, danced, fung, then cried 
 again, wrung his hands, beat his face and head, then fung 
 ar.d jumped about again, like a distracted -creature ; fo that 
 it was a great while before I cculd make him fpuak to me,, 
 or tell me what was 'the matter with him; but when he 
 came to the liberty of his fpeech, at the lail he told -me it was 
 his father. 
 
 Here indeed I was infinitely moved to fte that dutiful 
 and tender affection this poor favage hza. ta his aged psrenr. 
 He' would fit down by him in the boat, open his .breaft, and 
 hold his father's head clofe to his befom, half an hour, toge- 
 ther, ' to cherrfh him: then he took h's arms and ancles, 
 -which were -ft iff and numbed wiih binding, and chafed and 
 rubbed them with his hancY; by which means, perceiving 
 what the cafe was, I -gave him iorae rum, whicn proved of 
 great benefit to him. , 
 
 While we were bufy in this sdion, the ftvages had got- 
 ten almoft.out of fight; and happy it was we uid not p^r- 
 luc them : For there arofe from tne north-wen 1 , which con- 
 tinued all night long, fuch.a violent. ficrm, that I could not 
 (uppofe. otherwile but that they were ail dro.vned. After 
 this I called Friday to me, and alked hirn if he had given 
 his father any bread: He fhook 'his head and fai:, f* None.. 
 
 F 2 
 
 
 " not one bit, me eat a up all ;" fo I gave him a cake of 
 bread out of a little pouch I carried for this end. J like- 
 wife gave h^m a dram for himfelf, and two or three bunches 
 of raiiins for his father. Both thefe he carried to him, for 
 he would make him drink the dram to comfort him. 
 
 Away then he runs out of the boat as if he was bewitched 
 with fuch an extraordinary fwiftnefs, that he was out of 
 light as it were in an inftant ; but at his return I perceived 
 him flacken his pace, becaufe he had fomething in his hand. 
 And this I found to be, as he approached nearer, an earrhen 
 jug with iome water for his father, with two more cakes of 
 bread, which he delivered into my hands. Being very 
 thirfty myfelf, I drunJk fome of the water, of which when 
 his father had drank furHciently, it more revived his fpirits 
 than all the rum I had given him. 
 
 I then called Friday to me, and ordered him to carry the 
 Spaniard one of the cakes, and fome water, who was 
 repefing himfelf under a green place, under the fhade of a 
 tree, bur fo wea^k, that though he exerted himfelf, he could 
 not ftand upon his feet. Upon which I ordered Friday to 
 3-ub and bathe his ancles with rum, as he did his father's. — 
 But every nrnute he was employed in this he would caft a 
 wifhful eye towards the boat, where he left his father fit- 
 ting ; who fuddenly difappearing, he flew like lightning 
 to him, and finding he had only laid himfelf down to eafe 
 his limbs, he returned back to me prefently, and then I 
 fpoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him, and lead him 
 to the boat, in order to be conveyed to my dwelling, where 
 I would take care of hhn. Upon which Friday look him 
 upon his back, and fo carried him to the canoe, fetting him 
 clofe by his father; and prefently ftepping out again, 
 launched the boat off and paddled it along the more fatter 
 than I cculd walk, though the wind blew very hard too, 
 and having brought them fafe to the creek, away he runs to 
 fetch the other canoe, which he brought to the creek almoft 
 <as foon as J got to it by land, when wafting me over, he 
 took our new gueftsout of the boat ; but fo weak were they 
 that I was forced to make a kind of a hand-barrow ; and 
 when I came to my caftlc, not being willing to make an 
 entrance into my wall, we made them a hand fome tent, 
 covered with old fails, and boughs of trees, making two 
 good beds of rice ftraw, with blankets to lie upon and cover 
 them. Thus., like an abfolute king over fubje&s who owed 
 
 
 their lives to me, I thought myfelf very- confiderable, efpe- 
 cially as I had now three religions in my kingdom, my man 
 Friday bein^ a Proteitart, hi* father a Pagan, and the Spa- 
 uiard a Papift : bat I gave liberty of conference to them all. 
 
 To get provisions for my poor weak fubjects, I ordered 
 Friday to kill me a yearling goat; which when he had done, 
 I Cut off the hinder quarters, and chopping it iato fmall 
 pieces, boiled and dewed it, putting barley and rice into 
 the brr.th. This I carried into their tent, fet a table, dined 
 with them myfelf, and encouraged them. Friday was my 
 interpreter to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too, 
 who fpoke the languape of the favages pretty well. After 
 dinner, I ordered Friday to fetch home all our arms from the 
 field of batt'e, and the next day, to bury the dead bodies,, 
 -which he did accordingly. 
 
 And now I made Friday inquire of his father, whether 
 he thought thefe favsg^s had efcaped the late ftcrm in their 
 canoe? and if fo, whether they would not return with a 
 power too great for us to refill? Lie anfwered, that ne 
 thought it impcrTible they could outlive the ftorm ; or, if 
 they were driven fouthwardly, they would come to a land 
 where they would be as certainly devoured, as if they were 
 drowned in the fea. And fuppofe they had attained their 
 own country, the ftrangenefs of their fatal and bloody at- 
 tack, w( uld make them tell their people, that the reil of 
 them were killed by thunder and lightning, not by the 
 hand of man, but by two heavenly fpirks, (meaning Friday 
 and ire,) who were font from above to deitroy them. And 
 this, he faid, he knew, becaufe he had heard them fay the fame 
 to one another. And indeed he was in the right on't; for 
 I have heard fince, that thefe four men gave out that who- 
 ever went to that enchanted ifland, would be deitroy ed by 
 fire from the gods. 
 
 No canoes appearing focn after, as F expected, my ap- 
 prehenfions ceaftd : Inftead of which my former thoughts 
 of a voyage took place, efpecially when Friday's fatner af- 
 fured me, I mould have good ufage in his nation. As to 
 the Spaniard, he told me, that ftxteen more of his country- 
 men and Portcguefe, who had been fhipwrecked, made 
 their efcape thither; that though they were in union with 
 the favages, yet-they were wry referable for want of pro- 
 v-ifions and other neoeilaries. When 1 afked him ab:ct 
 the particular? of his voyvge, he anfwered that their (hip > 
 
 F3 
 
 
 was bound from R^o de la Plata to the Mavannah; that 
 when the {hip was loft, only five men periihed in the ocean ; 
 the reft, haying faved themfelves in the boat, were now 
 landed o;\ the main continent. And what do they intend, 
 to do there ? faid I. He replied, they have concerted mea- 
 fures to efcape, by building a veffel, but that they had nei- 
 ther tools nor provifions, fo that all their de&gns came ta 
 nothing. Suppafing, faid 1, I fhould make a propofal, and 
 invi:e them here, would they not carry me prifoner to New 
 Spa : n ? He anfwered no ; for he knew them to be fuch ho- 
 reft men, as wcnld -learn to ad fuch inhuman bafenefs ta 
 i their deliverer: That, if I pleafed, he and the old favage 
 would go over to them, talk with them about it, and bring 
 me an, anfwer : That they fhould all fwear fidelity to, me 
 as their leader, upon the Holy Sacrament ; and, for his part* 
 he Wf ukl not only do the fame, but jland to the lail drop 
 Oii his b!o d, fhould there be; occafian. 
 
 Thefe folemn affurances made me refolve to grant them 
 relief, and to fend tbefe two ever for that purpofe ; but 
 when every thing was fez^y, the Spaniard raifed-an objec- 
 tipn, which carried a great deal of weight in it : '? You> 
 " knew, Sir/ P faid he, <4 that having been fome time with 
 ^ you, I cannot bat be fenuble of your ftock of rice and ' 
 fi corn, fufEcient, perhaps, for us at prefent, but not for them, 
 ** ihou)d; they corne over preterit!/, much iefs to vi&ual a 
 6i vefi'd for an intended voyage. Want might be as great 
 €i an occallon for them to difagree and rebel, as the children 
 " of Ifrae-l 'did againit God hirnfelf, whea they waned 
 if bre^d in the wildernefs. And, therefore, my advice is, 
 ct (o wait smother; harveft', and in the mean time cultivate 
 " and improve feme mare land, whereby we may have 
 if plenty of proviiinis, in order to execute ojt deilgn." 
 
 This advice of the Spaniard's I approved extremely, and 
 fo fatisfi.d was I of his fidelity, tnat 1 ejleemed him ever 
 after. . And thus we aii four wenc to work upon fome morer 
 land, and again ft feed -time we had gotten fo much cured 
 and trimmed up, as was faffeiewt to fow twenty-two buJhels 
 of barley on, and fix een jars of rice, which was, in (hort,. 
 all the ie d we had to. Tpare-. As we we«e four in number,. 
 and by th : s time all in good health, we feared not a hun- 
 dred Indians, fnould they venture to attack us ; and while 
 the corn was growing, I pitched upon fome trees, 6: ta 
 build us a large vefl'ei, in cafe the Spaniards came over fc 
 
 
 .which being marked, I ordered Friday and his father to cut 
 them down, appointing the Spaniard, who was now my 
 privy counsellor, to over fee. and direct the whole. I like- 
 wife increa fed my flocks of goats, by (hooting the w Id 
 dam*, and bringing home their kids to my indoiure. Nor 
 did I negled the grape feaion, but cared them as ufual, 
 though 1 had fuch a quantity now, as would have filled 
 eighty ba re s with raifins. And thus all of us being em- 
 ployed, they in working, and I in providing for them,- till 
 harveii came, G d Almighty bleffed the trxreaie of it fo 
 much, that from twenty-two barrels of bar ey, we thrafh d 
 out two hundred and twenty, and the like quantity or rice, 
 fufficitnt to visual a fhip fit to carry me and all the Spani- 
 ards to any part of America. . 
 
 Thus the principal objection being anfwered, by a fuffw 
 cient flock of provfions, I fent my two ambailadors over 
 to the main land, wi h a regal authority to admir-iller the-' 
 oaths of allegiance ar-d fidelity, and have an inilrument 
 figned under their hands, though I nev^er a&ed v.hether 
 they had pen, ink, or- paper ; when giving each of them a 
 mufket, eight charges of powder and ball, and provifions-- 
 eroogh f)r eight cays, they failed away with a fair gale, 
 en a dav wh*n the moon was at full. 
 
 Scarce a fortnight had pafftd over my head, but im- 
 patient for their return, J laid me down to fl^ep one monringc, 
 when a itrange accident happened; which was "ufnered in v 
 by Friday's coming running to me, and calling aloud, 
 84 MaRer, matter, they are come, they are come." Upon 
 which, not dreaming of any danger; out ! jumped from my 
 bed, put on my clothes, and hurraed through my little grove; 
 when, locking towards the fea, I perceived a boat about a 
 league and a half dUlant, Handing in fo<- the i\o?e with the 
 w'.iid fair. 1 be held they did not come froni the fide where 
 the land lay err; but from the iouthern moil end of the iHand i 
 So thefe bei^g none of the people we wanted,. I ordered 
 Friday to he ill 1, till fuch time as 1 carr.e down fram the. 
 mountain, which wth my ladder I now afcer.ded, in order. 
 to. difcover more fully what they were ; and no-v with the 
 help of my perfpc£tive- glaf?,. I- plainly perceived an Eng- 
 lifh thip, which 1 concluded ic to be, by the fafhion of us 
 long boat; and which filled me with fuch uncommon trans- 
 pores of joy, that I cannot tell how to eefcribe; and yer 
 feme fee ret doubts hung about me,, proceeding from I keov^ 
 
 F 4r 
 
 
 not what e'aufe, as though I had reafon to be upon my 
 guard. And, indeed, 1 would have no man contemn the 
 secret hints and intimations of danger, wh ! ch very often are 
 given, when we may imagine there is no poflibility of its 
 being real ; for had 1 not been warned by this filent admo- 
 nition, I had been in a worfe fituation than before, and 
 perhaps inevitably ruined. 
 
 Not long it was, before I perceived the boat to approach 
 the Chore, as though they looked fur a place where they 
 might conveniently land ; and at hit they ran their boat on 
 ihore upon t e beach, about half a mile's diftance ; which 
 proved fo much the happier for me ; fince, had they come 
 into the creek) they had landed juft at my door, and might 
 not only have forced me out of my caitle, but plundered 
 me of all I had in the world. Now I was fully con- 
 vinced they were all Englishmen, three of which were un- 
 armed and bound ; when immediately the fir 11 four or five 
 Iraped on (bore, and took thofe thr:e out of the boat as 
 prifoners; one of whom I could perceive ufed the moil 
 pafli nate geftures of entreaty, affliction, and defpair, while 
 she others, in a leiler degree, (bowed abundance of concern. 
 
 Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very much as- 
 toniihed, and I beckoned to Friday, who was- below, to 
 sfcend the mountain, and likewife to view this fight. *' O 
 ** nufter," faid he fo me, €( you fee Englifh mans eat pri- 
 *} ibners ss well as Gvage 'mans/*- And do you think they 
 will eat them, Friday f faid I, " Yes," faid Friday, " they 
 li eat-a all up." No, no, faid I, Friday, I am much more 
 concert ed left, they murder them, but as for eating them 
 up 9 that 1 am flue thy will rever do. 
 
 And now I t or only lamented my misfortune *n not hav- 
 -ving the Spaniard and the lavage with me, but alfo that I 
 could not con-.e w thin fhot of them unperceived, (tbey hav- 
 ing no fire-arms among them,) and fave tnefe three men, 
 whom I thougi.t they were going to kill ^ith their fwords. 
 But fome comfort it was to me, that I perceived they were 
 fet at liberty to go where they pleafed, the rafeally feamen 
 Scattering about as though they had a mind to fee the place; 
 and fo long did tney negligently ramble, that fjie tide h^d 
 ebbed fo low as to leave tne boat aground. Nor were the 
 two men who we e in her more circumfpect ; for having 
 drunk a little too much liqaor, they fell fait afleep ; but one 
 of tneai waking before the other, and perceiving the beat 
 
of RoanrsoK cRtnos. - ~ 123 
 
 too fail aground for his ftrength to move it, he hallooed out 
 to the reft, who made ail poffi-ble- expedition to come to 
 him ; but as Provicence ordered it, all their force was in- 
 effectual to launch her, when I cculd hear them fpeak to 
 cne another " Why Jet her alone, Jack, can't ye ; (he']! 
 float next tide ;" by which words I was fully convinced they 
 were my own countrymen. I all this while lay very quiet, 
 as being fully fenlrble it could be- no iefsthan ten hours be-- 
 fore the boat could be afloat, and then it would be fo dark*, 
 that they could not eafily perceive me, by which means £ 
 fhould be more at liberty to hear their talk, and obferve air 
 their motions ; not but that I prepared for my defence ; yet,, 
 as I had another -fort of. an< enemy to combat with, I acled 
 with more cauacn. I<tcok two fu fees on my fhoulder, and^ 
 ^ave Friday three mufke sy befides my formidable goat- 
 ikin coat and m onflrous cap made me look as fierce and 5 
 terrible as Hercules of old, efp^cially when two pillols were 
 ituck in my belt, and my naked f word hanging by my fide. 
 
 If was my defrgn at &rft not to make any attempt till it 
 was dark ; ar.d it being now two o'clock, in the very heat 
 of the day, the failors were all draggling in the woods, and" 
 undoubtedly were lain down to Deep, The thrse poordif- 
 treflVd creatures, too anxious to get any repefe,' were how- 
 ever feared under the (hade of a great tree, about a quarter * 
 of a mile from me. Upon which, without any more ado, I • 
 approached towards them, with my man following -behind ! 
 me, and, before I was perceived, I called ^aloud to them in. & 
 Spar.im, " What are je, Gentlemen ?'' 
 
 At thefe words, they ilarted up in great confufion; when 
 they "beheld the Grange ii^ure I made; they returned no » 
 anfwer, but feemed a> if they would -fly-from me. " Gen- 
 *' tlemen, ?> fa-d I, inEnglilh, " don't be afraid ; perhaps yoa ?

 "every . action between you a-^d thefe brutes fir ce your

 "and heard us, they fhoujd murder us all/* " Have they 
 €< firearms r? faid 1. ** They have but two pieces," faid 
 he, "" one of which is left in the boat." He alfo told me* 
 there were two enormous villains among them* that were 
 the authors of this mutiny, who, if they were killed or 
 feized, might induce the reft to return to their obedience. — 
 «' Well, well/' faid J, ei let us retire farther under the- 
 fff covering of the woods ;•" and there it was I made thefe 
 conditions with him.

 I>=day ard myfelf a paiTige^r^r/j to England. 
 
 When he had given- me all the fatisfa&ion I could defirr, 
 I gave him and his two companions each of them a gun,, 
 with powder and bait fdmclert^ adviilng ihtm to fire upon 
 them as they lay fi'eepingv The Captain mod eft ly faid, that ' 
 lie was for ry to kill them;;, though on the other hand, to 
 let thefe villains efcape, who were the authors of his mifery^ 
 might be the ruin of us all, '-" .Well > 9% faid he, *' doasyoi*

 the fiock : of his gun ; three others were alfo /lightly wound- 
 ed, who at my approach cried out for help. Th's the Cap- 
 tain granted, upon condition that they would (wear to be 
 fcrue to him in recovering the (hip,, which they folemnly did j 
 }) wcver I obliged the Captain to keep them b:>und. After

 ¥®3% and bring away the oars and fails ; wheri, at their r^ 
 turn, three men coming backhand feeing their late did reflect 
 Captain now their c nqi-eror, fubmitted to be bovrnd alfo. 
 And then it was, that having more hheriy, I related the ad~- 
 ventures of my own life, which- he heard with a ferious 
 and wonderful attention. After dm, I carried kimsnd ht$\ 
 two companions into my 11 tie fortified cafile; fh/Qwed thenar-, 
 a 1 my conveniences, and refreshed them with fitch provi- 
 irons as I could afFord. When this was over we began to 
 confider aboiu regaining the ihip. He faid mat the^e were 
 twenty-frx hands' en board, w no knowing theix lives were 
 forfeited by the law for confpiracy and mutiny, were foyery 
 hardened, that it would be dangerous for cur (mall company 
 to attack them, Th ; s was a reafo^able in fertnre indeed ; 
 but fomething we rnu-t refoive or > and immediately, put in 
 execution. We therefore heaved the boat upon the beach 
 i6 high that- /he could not moot offal high warer»mark ? and 
 broke a hole in her not eaflly to be ilopped ; fo that all thev 
 f>gnals they gave for the boat to came onboard we?e in\ 
 va:n. This obliged them to (end another boat afhore^ with 
 ten men armt'd, whofe faces the Captain plainly decried, 
 the boatfwain being the chief officer; bat he faid there 
 were three honeft lad* among- them/ who were forced 
 in o the con (piracy. Hereupon I gave him frefti courage^ ^ 
 (for I- had perceived he was in coneefn>) in the mean while 
 fecuring our prifonerr, exeept two, who-m we took to our 
 affi (lance, we thought ourfelves able enough to-adventure^ 
 a battle, When the fa lors landed, and beheld their boat: 
 in that condiuon, they not only hallooed, but nred for -their * 
 companions to hear, yet they received no anfwer. This  
 ftruck them i*t$h. horror and aWxemeni? and^thlnking their 
 companions were murdered, they mace as if they w ? ou'd re- 
 tain to the fhrp. 1 could perceive the Captain's counte- - 
 n^nce change at this, lill of -,a sudden, three nu-n were or- 
 dered to look after tie boat, while the ether feven leapt 6oM 
 $iore in order to fearch.Lr their companions; and, if:deed> 
 they came to the brow of the hi;, near my ancient caille,. 
 from whence they could fee to a great di ft a nee in the woodsy 
 and there ihoucirg and. hallooing till tired and weary,, the . . 
 at length, feated themfelves under a fp reading tree: My 
 opinion was, that nothing could be -done till night, when 1. 
 might ufe fome artifice to get them all out of the b >at ; bug 
 ts£. a fudden they lifted up, and , made to the fea-iide-- 
 
 F S 
 
 
 hereupon I ordered Friday and the Captain's mate to go 
 pver the c*e*k, and halloo as *oud as they could, and fo de- 
 coying them into the woods, come round to me aga'n. And 
 His, indeed, had good efrecl ; for they followed the noife, 
 till coming weftward to the Creek, thev called for their boat 
 I? carry them over, and taking one of the o;en out of her, 
 jeft two to look after her, having faflenod her to the flump 
 of a little tree on fliore. Hereupon immediately the Cap- 
 tain and our party palling the creek, out of their light, we 
 furprifed trern both, by the Captain's knocking down one 
 and ordering the other to Amend sr upon pain of dea h, 
 and who being the honeitefl of them all, fincerelv joined 
 with us. By this time it was pretty hte ; when the red 
 returning to their boat, which they found aground in the 
 ereek, the tide cut, and the men gone, they ran about wring- 
 ing their hands, crying it was an enchanted ifiand, and tint 
 they mould be all murdered by fpirits or devils. My mere ' 
 would willingly have fallen upon them, but I would not 
 agree to hasard any of cur party. Bur, to be more certain, 
 Friday and the Captain crawled upon their hands and feet, 
 as near as pofiible ; and when the boa? (warn approached 
 in tight, fo eager was the Captain, that be fired and killed 
 him on the ($o\ ; Friday wounded the next man, and a third 
 ran away. -Hereupon 1 advanced with my whole army ;. 
 and, it being dark, I ordered the man we had furprifed in 
 the boat, to call them by the : r names, and to parley with 
 them. Acer rdinglv he called cut aloud, f* Tom Smith, 
 Tom Smith \" Be snfwered, " Whole that?" " Robinfon!" 
 3Dfvvered the other. A< For God's fake, Tom, furrender 
 ** immediately, cr you're all dead men." a Who mull we 
 " furrender i-frl**; fays Smith. a To our Captain and fifty mer* 
 ''here, who have taken me prifjr.er, wounded Will Fryer, 
 4i and killed the boatfwain/' fi Shdl we have cjuarers, 
 tbenr" faid he. Hereupon \he Captain calls out, "You* 
 *< Smith, you knew my voice, furrenderdinirnediately, and 
 " you {}iaJ| have all your lives granted, except Will Aikins." 
 Her. upon Atkins cr'ed ou% '* What have J. done, Captain, 
 ** moce than the ie!l, who have been as bad as me ?" But 
 that was a lie, for he was the pcrfon that laid hold of him, 
 and bound him. However he was ordered to fubrrtit to the 
 governors mercy, for fuch was I cal'ecL And fo, laying 
 down their ann<\ we b„und them air, and ieised oa their 
 boat 
 
 
 After this, the captain expoftulated with them, telling 
 them that the governer was an kngMfhrnan, who- might ex- 
 ' ecute them there ; but he thought they wouid all be fent to 
 England, except Will Atkins, who was ordered to p'epare 
 for death the next morning. Hereupon Atkins implored the 
 Captain to intercede for his life, and the reft begged they 
 might not be fent to England. Th-s anfwered our project 
 fc.l feizing the (hip. For after fending Atkins and tw • of 
 the wont faft bound to the cave, and the reft being com- 
 mitted to my bower, 1 fent the' Captain to treat with them 
 in the governor's name, offering them pardon^if they would 
 ailift in -ecovering the fhip. Upon w uch they all promis- 
 ed to ftand by him to the laft drop of their blood ; and who- 
 ever acted trcachercufly, ftrould be hanged in chains upon 
 the beach. They were ali releafed on thefe aMuraoces; 
 and then the Captain repaired to the other boat, making his^ 
 palTenger Captain of her, and gave him four men well arm- 
 ed ; while himfelf, his mate, and five more v/^nt in the 
 other boat. By midnight thev C3me within call of the fhip, 
 when the Captain ordered Robinfon to hail her, and tell 
 them that wkh great difficulty they had found the men at 
 laft. But while diey were difccurfing, the Captain, his 
 mate, and the refl entered and knocked down the fecond 
 male and carpenter, fecured thofe trnt were upon deck*., 
 by putting them under hatches, while the other boat's crew 
 entered and fecured the forecaftle ; they then broke into 
 the round- houfe, where the mate, after fome refiftance, (hoi 
 the pirate captain through the bead, upon which all the reit; 
 yielded ihemfelves prifoners. Andthus the fhip being re- 
 covered, the joyful fignal was &:ed y which I heard with 
 the greateit joy imaginable; nor was it long, before he 
 brought the (hip to an anchor at the creek's mouth, where 
 earring to me unawares, "There," fays he, "mydeareft- 
 ti friend and deliverer* there is your fhip, a>,d we are your 
 ** fervants :" a comfort fo unfpeakable, as made me fwoon 
 in his arm?,. while v with gratitude to heaven, we were ten^ 
 derly embracing each other. 
 
 Nothing now remained, but to confute what we mould 
 do with the prifoners, whom he thought it was not fafe to 
 take on board. Hereupon concerning with the Captain, I 
 d-effed myfelf in one of'his fuits, and fending for them, told 
 them, that I was going to leave the iCLnd with all my pea- 
 
 
 pie, if they would tarry there, there lives mould be fparesl? 
 if not, they fhoul-d be barged- a? the firft port tbey came at. 
 They agreed to ftay. Hereupon I tokHhem my whole Aory, 
 charging them to be kird to the Spa? iards,* that were ex- 
 pected, giving them all my arms, and informing them of every 
 thing n?ce(Tkry for their fubf5fttn.ee, after waichj 1 and my 
 man Friday went on board. But ;henext morVmg, two of the 
 men came fwlmming to the (hip's ft€e, defiring ch^ Captain 
 to take them on boards though he hanged them afterward s* 
 complaining ir.ightily how barbaroufly the other ufed therm 
 Upon which I prevailed wi;h the Captain to take them in y 
 and being feverly whipt and pickled, they proved more 
 Boneft for the future. And fo I bid farewell to this ifland,. 
 carrying along with rne 'my rnom j y,. my parrot, umbrella^ 
 and -goat'srikin cap; fetting fail December 12, 1636, after 
 twenty-eight years, two months, and ni et-en da* s resi- 
 dence, that fame day and month that I efcaped f/om Salee, 
 landing in England June M, 1687, after five and thirty 
 years abfenee from my own country,, which rendered me - 
 altogether a ({ranger there. 
 
 Here i found my fir ft Captains widow alive, who had 
 buried a fecond huiband, but ia very mean circumftances, 
 and whom ! made e&fy Upo« his account. Soon after, I 
 went down to York&me, where , all my family was expired, 
 except two fitters, and as many of one of my brother's 
 children. I fourd. ro provifi. n had been made for me,, 
 they concluding I had been long fmce dead; fo that I was 
 but in a very fierder ffiation. Indeed the Captain did m& 
 a great kindnefs> by his report to the owners-, how X had 
 delivered their fhip oh the I>cfoIate Ifland, upon which they 
 raade me a .present of 2QQV fterlli g. i next went to Li f~ 
 &jn, nking my man Friday with me, and there arriving in 
 April, 1 met the Portuguese Captain,, who had taken me on 
 board on ih-e African coait ; but being ancient, he had left 
 off the fea, and religr-.ed ail his buiinefs ;o his fon, who 
 followed the Brazil trade. So altered' both of us. were, that 
 We did not know each other at firit, till I discovered my- 
 felf more fully to Mm. After a few embraces, I began to 
 icjquire of my c .-ncerns ; and" then the old gentleman u Id 
 me, that it was nine years iince he had been at Brazil, 
 where mv parirer was then living, but my truAees were. 
 both dead; -hat he. believed I mould have a good account 
 ®£ the prcdu£l of my plantation i that the imagination >66 
 
 
 8* y being loft, had obliged my truftces-to give an eftimate 
 ®f my (hare to the procurator Meal, who in cafe of my not 
 returning, had given one-third to the king, and the reft to 
 the mona fiery of St. Auguftine : but if I put in my claim* 
 or any one for m?, it wo -iid be returned* except the yearly 
 product which was given- to the poor, I then de&red him 
 to tell me what improvement he- thought had been made of 
 mv plantation, and whether he imagined it was worrh my 
 while to look after it? He anfwered he did net know how 
 much it was improved; but this he was certain of, that my 
 partner was grown vainly rich upon his half of it;, and, that 
 he had been informed, that the king had 200 moidjres per 
 annum for his third part. He added, that the forvivors of 
 my truftees were" periens of an ingenuous character ; that' 
 my partner could witnefs my title, mv name being regi-ier- 
 ed in the country, by which means I inodd indifponfably 
 recover considerable fums of money. But, arifwe-ed I> 
 }*ow could my trufiees difpofe of mv effects, when I made 
 you orly my heir? This, fa id he,, was true; but, there be- 
 ing no affidavit made of my death, he could n:;t act as my 
 executor. However he had ordered his Am,, (then at Bra- 
 ail.) to set by procuration upon my accouBt, and he had 
 taken poffeiBon of my fugar-houfe-, having accounted him- 
 felf for eight years with my partner and trufiees for the pro- 
 fits, of which he would give me a very good account. 
 
 And, indeed , this he performed very faithfully in a fe«^ 
 days, making himfelf indebted to me 470 rnoidores-of gold r 
 over and above what had^ been loll at fea, after I had left 
 the place. And then he recounted to me what misfortunes 
 he bad gone through, which forced my money cut of his 
 hands, to buy a part in a new fhip: a But," fays he, "ycul 
 ^fnall not want; take this; and, when my Ton returns, 
 5* every farthing fhall be paid youv ,? . Upon which he put 
 into my bands, a purfe of l-oC -moidores in gold ; as likewife 
 the infirumtnl, containing the title to the fhip which his 
 fon was in, and which he offered as fecer y for the remain- 
 der. Eu< r.ally when I faw fo much goodnefs, generofUy, 
 tendrrnefs, and real honefty, I had not tne heart to accept 
 it, for fear he mould ifraken himfelf upon my account. — 
 fef It is true," faid he, u it may be fo;. box then the m ney 
 "is yours, not mine, and you may hive t e greateil occa- 
 ••* fion for it-" However l returned fifty of them b^ck, 
 again, p;omiftng that I would freely forgive him the other 
 
 
 hundred when I got my effects into my hands , and that f£ 
 deiigned to go myfelf for that purpofe. But he told me 
 he could favs me that trouble, and fo caufed me to enter 
 my name with a public notary, as likewife my affidavit, with 
 a procuration affixed to it; and this he ordered me to fend 
 in a letter to one of his acquaintance, a merchant in Brazil ; 
 and, indeed, nothing could be more faithfully and honour- 
 ably cbferved ; for, in feven months time, 1 had a very faith- 
 ful account of all my effecTs, what fums of money were 
 r&ifed, what expended, and what remained for my ufe : In 
 a word, I found myfelf to be worth 50001. fterling,and 1000k 
 per annum. Nor was this ail; for my partner congratulated 
 me upon my being alive, telling me how much my planta* 
 tion was improved ; what Negroes were <u wprk>,and how 
 many Ave Marias he had faid to the Virgin Mary for my 
 prefervation, dtfiring me to accept kindly fome prcfenrs he • 
 had fen i me, which I found mowed the greateil generoiltv. 
 
 No footer did the (hip arrive, but 1 rewarded my faith- 
 ful Captain, by returning^ him the hundred moidores, and 
 notO")y forgave him all heowed rne, but I allowed him yearly 
 a hundred more, and fifty to his fon, during their lives. And 
 now being refolved to go to England, I returned letters of- 
 thanks to the Prior of St. Au^uftine, and in particuJar to my 
 old partner, with very fui table prefents. By the Captain's . 
 advice, I was perfuaded to go by land to Calais, and ther« 
 take pailage for England ;. when as it happened, I got a 
 young Enghfh gentleman, a merchant's fan at Lifbon, to ac- 
 company me, together with two English and two Porta- 
 guefe gentlemen; fp that with a, Portuguefe fcrvant, an.* 
 Englifh failcr^ and >my man Friday, there wers nine of us in 
 number. 
 
 Thus armed and equipped, we fel out, and came to Ma- 
 drid, when the fummer decaying we halted to Navarre, . 
 where wc were informed, that there wa* fcarceiy any paf- 
 fing, by reafon of the prodigious quanrity^of fnow; fothat- 
 we were obliged to abide near twenty days ?t Pampeluna, ; 
 and atlail to take a guide to cordud us fare towards Thou~- 
 Joufe. And now twelve other gentlemen joining with us, 
 together with their fervajnts, we had a very jolly company. 
 Away our guide-led us by frightful mountains, and through 
 /o mapy intricate mazes and windings, tnat we infenfibly 
 paiTed them, which as we travelled along, ufhered us into 
 the profpeclcf the fruitful and ^harming provinces of Lzn- 
 guedoc and Gafcopy, 
 
 
 But now came on two adventures, both tragicil and co- 
 mical. Firft, our guide was encountered by three wolves 
 and a bear, who fet upon him and h s horfe, and wounded 
 him in three places ; upon which my man, riding up to hs 
 aflMance, (hot one cf them dead upon the fpot, which 
 made the other retire into the woods. But the pleafatueft 
 adventure was, to behold my man attack the bear. 'Tis 
 fuch a creature, that if you lef him alone, he will never 
 middle with you ; and this my man very well knew, and 
 fo begging leave of me in broken Englifh, he told us <i he 
 *< would make good laugh." "Why, you fiily fool," faid 
 I, ''he'll eat you up at a mouthful." " Eatee me up !" re- 
 plied he, by way of fcorn, "me not only eatee him, but 
 "make much good laugh.", Upon which, palling off his 
 boots, he claps on his pumps, and runningafter the monftrous 
 betfl, he called out that he wanted to difcourfe with him, 
 an^ then throwing nones on purpofe to incenfe him, the 
 beaft turns about in fury, and, with prodig oas ftrides. 
 ihufties after him. But though he was not fwift enough to 
 keep up pace with Friday, who made up to us as it were 
 for help; yet being angry, u You dog," faid I, 'immdi- 
 €f ately take horfe, and let us fhoot the cream e." But he 
 cried, "Dear mafter, no (hoot, me make you laugh much." 
 And fo he turned about, making figns to follow, while the 
 brar ran after, till coming to a great oak, he afcended in a 
 minu.e, leaving his gun at the bott m of it. Nor did the 
 bear make any difficulty of it, but afcended like a cat, though 
 his weight was very great. You muft corJider I was not 
 a little amazed at the folly of my man, a* not perce vingany 
 tiling to ( ccafion our laughter, till fuch time as we rode up 
 nearer and beheld the beait mounted upon the oak, on the 
 beginning of the fame branch, to whicft Fr day cluni* at the 
 farther end, where he bear durfl not come. Hereupon. 
 Friday cried out, " Nojw, mailer, me make much laugh; me 
 make bear dance." Upon whicn he fell a (baking the 
 bough, which made t.ie creature lock behind him, to fee 
 how he could retreat. Tnen, as if die bear had urtderitood 
 his ftammering Engiifh ; if Why you no come farther, Mr, 
 "Brar?" faid he, " pray, Mr. Bear, come far here;" and 
 then indeed we all bur ft in o a laughter, efpecially when 
 .we perceived Friday drop like a fquurel upon tr-e ground* 
 leaving the beaft to make the belt of his way down the tree* 
 
 
 And now thinking it the moft convenient lime to moot the 
 creature, Friday cried out, *'G dear mailer, no ihoot, me 
 Ci ihoot by and by ;" when taking up the gun, '*« me no 
 *' fhoot yet," faid he, *'mc make one more much laugh. 9> 
 And accordingly he was as good as his word; for the crea- 
 ture defcending backward from the tree very leifurely, he- 
 fore he could lay one foot on the ground, Friday fhot- him 
 through the ear, ftone dead ; and look : ng to fee whether 
 we were pleated, he burffi out into a hearty laughter, fay- 
 ing, u So we kill de bear in my country, not wjth the gun, 
 ** but with much long arrows/' Thus ended our diverfion 
 to cur great fatisfacrion; efpecially in a place where the 
 terrible how lings ftruck us with a continual terror. Bat 
 the mows now growing very deep, particularly on "the 
 mountains, the ravenous creatures were then obliged to feek 
 for fu'ttnance in the villages ,where coming by furprife on 
 the country 1 people, kUJed feveral of them, belidcs a great 
 number of their iheep and horfes. 
 
 Our guide told us, we had yet one more dangerous place 
 to pafs by; and if there were any more wolves in the coun- 
 try, there we mould find them. This was a fm'ail plain, 
 enecmpafTed with woods, to get through a long lane to the 
 village whee we were to lodge. "When we emered the 
 wood, the fun was within half an hour of fetting ; and a 
 little af:er It was fet 5 we came into the plain, which was 
 not above two furlongs over, and then we perceived five 
 gren wolves crofs the road, without taking notice of us, 
 and fo fwift as though they were perfuifrg after their prey. 
 Hereupon oar guide, bel.eving there were more coming, 
 deflred us to be upon our guard. Accordingly or eyes- 
 were very circumfpsct, till abouc half a league farther, we 
 perceived a dead horfe, and near a "dozen of wcLes devoir- 
 mg its csrca'e. My. man Friday fain would have fired at 
 them, but } would not permi; him ; nor had we gone half 
 over the .plain, b.t *e heard dreadful howlings in a wood 
 en cur left, when prefently we faw a hundred come up 
 ggainri; lis, as though they had been an experienced army. 
 r i his cH.'iged us to form curfeives in the bed manner ; ard 
 then 1 ordered that every o her rr.an mould fiie; and thofe 
 who did ijotj might be ready to give a fecond volley,, mould 
 thev advance upon us; av:d then every man mould make 
 ufe of his piftois. But there was no neceflity for this; for 
 the enemy being terrified, Hopped at the noiie of the. fere;. 
 
 
 four of them were (hot dead, -nd feveral others being 
 wounded, went bleeding away, as we could very plainly 1 
 difcover by the fnow. And now remembering what had 
 beet? often told me, that fuck was the majefty of a man's 
 voice, as to ftrike terror tven in the fierceil creatures, I or- 
 dered all our cornpanio is to halloo, as loud -as poffi'We ; and 
 in this notion I was not altogether mill-ken; for they im-* 
 jraed iately turned about upon .he  firft halloo, and began to 
 retire; upon which, ordering a fecond volley in their- 
 rear, they galloped into the woods with great precipitation. 
 
 Thus we had fome fmail time to loid our pieces agdirv 
 and then made all the hafte we could on our way; but we 
 had not rode far, before we were obliged to pat ourfelves 
 in a polture of defence as before, being alarmed with a very 
 dreadful noile in the fame wood, on our left hand, the fame 
 .way as we were to pafs, only that rt>was fome diftance 
 from us. Ey this time the darkfome clouds began to fpread 
 over the elements, and the night growing very dufky, made 
 it fp much the more to our difad van tags ; but ftill the noife 
 increaiing, we- were fully afFured that it was the howling 
 and yelling of thofe ravenous creatures ; when pre-feniiy 
 three troops of waives on our front appeared in light, as 
 fhough a great number of them had a dedgn to furround us 
 and devour us in fpite of fue. But as they did not fall 
 upon us immediately, we p oceeded on our journey in as fwift 
 a manner as the ro*ds would permit our horfes, which was 
 only a large trot. It was in this maa;er we travelled, till 
 fuch a time as we difcoverrd another wopd, and had the 
 prof p* -I of its entrance,. through which we were to pafs, at 
 the fartheft 6&e of the plain. Bat fu rely none can exprefs 
 the terror we were in, when approaching Ih-e lane, we per- 
 ceived a co-ifufed number of the fierce ft wo ! ves, (landing,, 
 as it were, guarding its entrance. Nor. were we long in. 
 this amaz.emen , before another oceoflon of aorr> r prefenU 
 ed ilfelf ; for fudde >ly we heard the rep ^n c£ a gun ac ano- 
 the* ope ing in the wood ;. and looking that way, out ran a 
 horfe brnled and' faddied, hoing wifr.h the greateil fwiftnets* 
 and ni lefs than iixt en or Jeveuee i wolves purfaing after 
 him, in order to devour the poor creature ; ard unquestion- 
 ably they did D, afver ihey'h'kd run hnn down, net being able 
 to hold out that f.viunefs with which, he at 11; it efc&pei- 
 ibejiw 
 
 
 When we rode up to that entrance from whence the horfe 
 came fo th, 'here lay the carcafe of another horfe and two 
 men, mangl d and torn by thefe devouring wolves : and un- 
 doubtedly cne of thefc. men was the perfon .who fired the 
 gun which we had heard, for the piece lay by him ; but, 
 alas! mod of the upper part of his bo iy and his head were 
 entombed in tic bowels of thefe ravenous creatures. 
 
 What c urfe 10 take, whether to proceed or retreat, we 
 could not te'l ; but it was not oag before the wolv s tnem- 
 felves made us to come to a resolution: for f ch numbers 
 furrounded us, every one of whom expected t h eir p<ey, 
 that were our bodies to be divided among them, there would 
 not be half a mouthful a-piece:- But happy, very happy it 
 was for us, th**t but a little way from the entrance, there lay 
 fome very large timber trees, which I fu^pofed had been 
 cut down and laid there for fale ; amongft which I drew my 
 htt ! e tro p, placing ourfeives in a line behind ore long tree, 
 which ferved us for a bread- work, when deiiring them to 
 aligh f , we ftood in a triangle, or three fronts, doling our 
 bodies in the centre, the only place where we could pre- 
 ferve them. 
 
 Never certainly was there a more furious charge than 
 what the wolves made upon us in this place: and the fight 
 of the iiorfes, which were the principal prey they aimed at r 
 provoked their hunger^ and added, to their natural fiercenefs. 
 They came on us with a mod dreadful no fe, that made the 
 woods ring aga'n ; and beginning to mount the pieces of 
 timber, I ordered every man to fire, as before directed : 
 and, indeed, fo wA\ did they take their aim, that they kiled 
 feven! of the wolves at the firft volley ; but (till we were 
 obliged to keep a continual firing, by reafon they came on 
 Jike devils, pulhing cne another with the greateft fury.— 
 But our fecond volley fomething abated their c< urage, when 
 Hopping a little, we hoped they would have made the beft 
 of their way ; however it did not prove fo, for others made 
 a new attempt upon us ; and though in four firings we killed 
 feveneen or eighteen of them, laming twice as many, yet 
 they fcveral times fucceflively came on, as though they 
 valued not their lives for the fake of their prey. 
 
 Unwilling was I to fpend our laft xhot too fuddenly, and 
 therefore calling my other fervant, and giving him a horn 
 of powder, bid him lay a large train quite along the timber, 
 which he did, while Friday was charging my fufeeand his 
 
 
 own, wirh the greateft dexterity. By this time fhe wolves 
 coming up the limber, I fet fire to the train, by "hipping a 
 difchaned piftol clofe to the powder. This fo fcorched 
 and terrified them, that (bme fell down, and o.h^rs jumped 
 in amorg us; but thefe were immediately difpatc^ed, 
 when all the reft, frightened with the light, which t e dark- 
 fome night caufed to appear more dreadful, began at iengh 
 to retire ; upon which, < rdering our laft piftols to be fired 
 at once, giving at the fame time a great fhout, the wolves 
 were obliged to have recourfe to their fwiftnefs, and turn 
 tail ; a< d then we fallied out upon twenty lame ones, cut- 
 ting them in pieces w>th our (Words, which obliged them 
 to howl lamentably, to the terror of r heir fellows, who re- 
 finned to us the field us victorious conquerors. And, in- 
 deed, I queftion whether Alexander, king of Macedonia, 
 in any of his co« queits, had more occ^fion for triumph than 
 we had ; for he was bat attacked with numerous armies of 
 foldiers, whereas our little army was obliged to combat a 
 legi n of devils, as it were, *vcrfe than the cannibals, who, 
 the fame moment they had fUin us, would have facrificed 
 us, to fatisfy their vorac-ous appetites. 
 
 Thus ended our bloody battle with the beafts, having 
 killed threefcore of them, and faved our lives from their 
 fury. We uill had a league farther to go, when, as we 
 went, our ears were faluted with their mod unwelcome 
 howlings, and we expected every moment another attack. 
 But, in an hour's lime, we arrived at the town where we 
 were to lodge; and here we found the place uriclly guard- 
 ed, and all in terrible confuiion, as well they might, for 
 "fear of the bears and wolves breaking into the v-llagcin order 
 to prey upon their cattle and people. The next morning 
 we were obliged to take a new guide, by reafen the other 
 fell very bad of his wounds, which he h«d received, as be- 
 fore mentioned. After we, had reached Thouloufe, we 
 came into a warm, pleafent, and fruitful country, not infeft- 
 ed with wolves, nor any fort cf ravenous creatures : and 
 when we told our llory there, they much blamed our guide, 
 for conducting us through the fore'ft at the foot of the moun- 
 tains, in fuch a fevere feafon, when the fnow obliged the 
 wolves to feek for ihelter in the woeds. When we inform- 
 ed them in what manner we placed ourfelves, and the 
 horfes in the centre, they exceedingly reprehended us, and 
 
 
 *old us, It was a hundred to one but we had been all de* 
 ftroyed ; for that it was the very light cf the hoi fes (their 
 fo much defired prey) that made the wolves m ore ragingjy 
 furious than they would have been, which was evident, by 
 their being at ether times really afraid of a gun ; hut then 
 being exceedingly hungry ard furio'us upon that account, 
 their eagemefs to come at the horfes made them infer.fible 
 of their danger ; and that, if we had not, by a continual 
 fire, and at kil by the cunnirg ftratagem of the train of 
 powder, got the better of them, it had been great odds if 
 their number had not overpowered usj be fide?, it was a 
 great mercy we alighted from eur horfe^, and fought them 
 with that courage and conduit, which had wc failed to do, 
 every man of us, with cur beafts, had been devoured ; and/ 
 indeed, this was nothing but truth ; for never, in my life, 
 was I fo fenfible of danger, as when three hundred devils 
 came roaring upon us, to fhun whofe unwelcome company, 
 if I was fure to meet a Itcrm tvtxy week, 1 would rather 
 go a thoufand leagues. by lea. 
 
 I thii k I have nothing uncommon in my paiTage through 
 France to take notice cf, fince other travellers of greater 
 learning and ingenuity have given a more ample account 
 than my pen is able to fe-t for h. frcmThouloufe 1 travel* 
 led to Paris, from thence to Calais, where I took Shipping, 
 and landed at Dover the j 4ch of January, in a very cold 
 Tea fori. 
 
 Thus come to the end of my travels, I foon discovered 
 my new found efUte, and all the bills of exchange J had 
 were currently paid. The good ancient widow, my only 
 priv- counfello:-, thought no pains or care too great to pro- 
 cure my advantage; ror had I ever occafioo to blame her 
 fidelity, which drew from me an ample reward. I was f<i 
 leaving my  ffecTs in her hands, intending to fet out fo. 
 L)fboi<, tyd to tne Brazils ; but, ^s in the Defblate Uland, 
 I had jcrre doubts about the Rc'mifh religion, fo 1 knew 
 there v as liitle erccuragemervt to fettle there, unlefs I 
 - would apo''atize from the crthodcx faith, or live in conti»- 
 nual fear of tht Inqiufitun." Upon this account I reiolved 
 to (ell my plantation; r.nd, for that iruejat, 1 wrote to -my 
 old friend at Liibon, who returned me an anfwer to my great 
 fat;sfaction; which waf, that he wou'd fell it to good ac- 
 count; ho ever, if I the tight it convenient to give him li- 
 berty to offer it in my name to the two merchants, the fur* 
 
 
 vtvors of my tru flees, refiding at the Brazils, whoconfequently 
 knew its intrinfic value, having lived jult upon the fpot, 
 and who I was fei-fible were very rich, and therefore might 
 be the more willing to pufchafe.it; he did not in the lead 
 doubt, but that I mould make four or five thoufand pieces 
 of eight more of it, than I could if I difpofed of it in any 
 nher manner whatsoever. 
 
 You may be fure I could not but agree with this kind and 
 ingenuous propofal ; and immediately I fent him an order 
 to offer it to them, which he accordingly did ; fo that about 
 eight months after, the fhip being in that time returned, he 
 gave me a fatis actory account^that they not only willingly 
 accepted the offer, but that they had aifo remitted 33,000 
 pieces of eight to a correfpondent of their own at Lifoon, 
 in order to pay for the purchafe. 
 
 Hereupon, in return, I figned the inftrument of fale, ac- 
 cording to form, ^which they hid fent from Lifbon, and re- 
 turned it again to my old friend, 'he having lent me, for my 
 cftate, bills of three hundred and twenty eignt thoufand 
 pieces of eight, refer ving the payment of one hundred moi- 
 dores per annum, which I had allowed him duri\g^ life, 
 likt:wife fifty to his fon during life alfo, according to my 
 faitnful promife, which the plantation was to make good as 
 a rent charge. 
 
 And thus havng »eJ my reader to the knowledge of the 
 
 Hrst parts of my life, fo remarkable for the many peculiar 
 
 Kovidences that attended it, floating in the ocean of uncer- 
 
 ainty and difappointment, of adverfity and profperity, 
 
 egin:;ing foojifhly, and yet ending happily ; mecr.inks now 
 
 at I am come to a fafe *nd pleafant haven, k is time to 
 
 1 nut my anchor, aud, laying up my veiTel, bid, for a 
 
 ile, adieu to foreign adventures. I had n ; other concerns 
 pok after,, but the care of my brother's two fons, which, 
 h the good widow's perfuafrVns, obliged me to' continue 
 flome (even years. One of thefe, children I bred up a 
 gentleman, and the other an experienced tailor, remarkable 
 for his courage and bravery. Betides this, I married a vir- 
 tuous young gentlewoman of a very good family, by whom 
 I had two fons and one daughter. But my dear and tender 
 wife leaving this earthly ftagc, (as in the iecond pan of my 
 life you wdl hear,) which rent my foul, as it were, afunder, 
 my native country became weary and tiref me t me; and 
 
 y nephew happening to come from fea, tempted me to

 venture another voyage to the Eaft-Indics, which I di 
 the year 1694, at which rime I vifiied my ifUnd, and % 
 ferrned myielf of every thing that happened fince my C L

 One might reafrnably imagine, that what I had fufFered, 
 together with advanced age, ard the fear of lofing, not only 
 what I had gotten, but my life alfo, might have choked 
 up all <he feed $ of ufelefs ambition ard curiofity, and put

 WHEN we confider the puiffant force of Nature, and 
 
 w+at mighty influence it has many times over the temper 
 
 9 * of the mind, it will be no fuch great wonder to think, 
 
 f l that my powerful reafon fhould be overcome by a nrtch 
 
 * llrongrr inclination. My lale acquired kingdom ran con- 
 
 * r tinually in my thoughts ail the day, and I dreamed of it ia 
 
 the night; nay, I made it the continual fubjed of my talk, 
 
 e even to impertinence, when I. was awake. 1 had fuch va- 
 
 5 pours in ray head, that I actually fjppofed myfelf at my 
 
 * cajdle; rhat I not only perceived Friday's father, the old 
 
 Spaniard, and the wicked fatter?; but that I talked and'dif- 
 
 courfed with them about their manner of living ; that I heard 
 
 the things related to me, which I found afterwards to be 
 
 too true; and that I executed my judgments whh the greateft 
 
 ieverity upon the offenders. And, indeed, this anticipating 
 
 all the pleating joys cf my life, fcarceiy afforded -sne cne 
 
 pleafant hoLr : my dear and tender wife could not hut take

 big of another ; and that ] had lip occafio* to ferk for ro re 
 ricncs, who already wac bleded with fuffkiencv, with much 
 #rugglin.g faltered my refoluii ds at kit. revolving to apply 
 rnncif to f«;roe bufinefs or other, w'ich might pu* a period 
 to fuch. wardering incii nations. Hereupon [ boturht* li t\^ m 
 farm in the county of Bedford, with a rffolution to mov, 
 thither; upon this there was a p.etiy co v nent h j 
 forrounded w:th land, very c^pab'e of ini prove iiitht, which 
 lusted my temper, as to planting, managing, and cahlv|t?fig. 
 
 Nor was 'I long b stores I entered upon my new fettlement, >%A 
 having bought ploughs., arrows, carts, waggons horfes, 
 cow's, end fheep ; fo t at I now ied the life of a country 
 gentleman, and as happy in my retirement as rjh<? greiteil 33 
 monarch in. the worid. A*d what made me think my oj 
 happinefs the greater was, that I was in the rni'dle ftateof o 
 life, which my father had fo often recommended, much re- 
 fembring the felicity of a rural retirement which is elegantly 
 defcribed by the pon in thei'e iines-: * 
 
 Free from all vices, (ree from care, 
 Age has no pain, and youth no fnare. 
 
 But in the midft of this my happinefs, J was fuddenly 
 plunged in the greateft forrow that 1 could poffibly endure; 
 f r, wherrl leait expecled it, my dear and tender wife was rj{^ 
 forced to fubmk to the?lrrefiiUb;e power of De^> h leaving 
 this tranfi ory life for abel^r. it is impoiiible f r me to 
 exprefs the beauties of her mind, or the luvelineTs of hes 
 perfen ; neither can I too much lament her loft, which rm 
 lateft breath (hall record; her influence was greater over 
 me than the powers of my own reafon, the importunities of 
 fr\erd$, the inilruciiors of a fa. her, or the melting tears of a 
 tender and difconfclaie mother; in a word, me was the 
 fpiri: of all my ?ff*irs, and the centre of my enterprises.— 
 But now, fmce the cruel hand of D'#a'th had ciofed my dear- 
 eit's eyes, I fecmed in my though.us a ft* anger to the world ; 
 my privy counsellor being gone, i was like a fhip without a 
 pilot, that could only run before (he wind. -And when I 
 jooked around me in this bufy v^orid, one part labouring 
 for bread, and the other fqoandering away their eftates ; 
 this put me in mind how I tad lived in my little kingdom, 
 
 
 where both reafon and religion dictated to me, that there 
 
 vv?s fomething thai certainly was the reafon and end of life, 
 
 which was far fuperior to what could b" hoped for on this 
 
 2 the grave. My country delights were now as infipid 
 
 I dull, as mufic and fcience to thofe who have neither 
 
 • ; nor ingf-nuity. In ihoit, refolv>ng to leave ofFhoufe- 
 
 - . - ing, I left rny farm, and in a few months returned to 
 
 dun. 
 
 ,?u: neither could that great city, fa famous for its variety 
 entertainment, afford me any agreeable delight; a ftate 
 idlenefs I found to be the very dregs of life, and mo ft 
 Aartfttl to body and foul. It was now the beginning of the 
 izr 1684, at which time my nephew (who, as I before ob- 
 • rved, had been brought up to the fea, and advanced to be 
 aptain of a fcip) *as rexurned from a ftiort voyage to Bil- 
 . -)a, the flrft he had made in that ftation. He comes tome 
 ne morning; telling me, that fome merchants of his ac- 
 quaintance had propofed to him to go a voyage for them to 
 the Eail- Indies and China, in the manner of private traders; 
 *.* and now, uncle," faid he, " if you'll accompany me thither, 
 €t F-ll engage to land you upon your own ifland, to vific the 
 "ftate of ycur little kirgdom." 
 
 Juft before he came in, my thoughts were fixed to get a 
 patent for its pofTeffion, and then to fill it with inhabitants. 
 After I had paufed a while, and looked iteadfaftly on him, - 
 f What devil or fpirit," faid I, " fent you with this un- 
 -rky errand ?" He ftarted at.firft; but recovering him- 
 , when he perceived I was not otfended, ** Sir, replied 
 "what I have propofed cannot, I hope, be ft y led un- 
 ity, fince certainly ycu mull be deiirous to fee yeur little 
 Mtory, vvhere you reigned with more content than any of 
 r brother kings in the univerfe," — " Nephew," fa d I, 
 if you will leave me there, and call for me as you come 
 back, I Care not if 1 give my confer!:" but he anfwered, 
 that the merchants would not allow their ve/Tel, leaden 
 with an infinite value, to return there again, Which was\a 
 month's £*ii out of their way-; " be fides, Sir," faid he, < ; if I 
 lhould micarry, was ycur requeil gra-ted, why then you 
 would he locked up as before*" This, indeed, carried a 
 great deal of reafon in it ; but we found cut a remedy, and 
 that was to c.rry a fraire  Hoop on b ard, ready to be fet • 
 Dp in the r 11 and, by the a Hi (lance of fome ca peners, wmch 
 we fhoJd curry with us, that might be fi.ted in a few dap, 
 
 G 2 
 
 
 to to to fea. I was rot long in forming my refutation, 
 vhicb cverfwayed mv gcod friends the widow's, peKuaGons, 
 and the natural afFe&i n I bore to my young children. I 
 made my will, and fettled my ellate in fuch a manner, that I 
 wss perfectly fure my poor infaivs wc uld have juftce done 
 them. The good widow not cnly undertook to make pro- 
 vifion for my voyage, but alfo took the charge of my do- 
 mefUc affairs, and to provide for mv children's education; 
 and indeed no irothrr could take more care, or underitood 
 the office better ; for which I lived to reward and return 
 her my hearty thanks. 
 
 The beginning of January, 16154-5, my nephew being 
 ready to fail, I a- d Friday went on board in the Downs on 
 the 8(h, having, befides that (loop already mentioned, a 
 very confiderable cargo for my new colony. Firft, 1 had 
 fome fervants, whom I propofed to leave there, as they 
 fhould appear willing ; there were two carper ters a fmith, 
 and a very ingenious felfbw who was Jack-of-all- trades ; for 
 he was not only a cooper by trade, lu* alfo was dexterous at 
 making wheels, and hard-mills to grind corn, Ike wife a 
 good turner, and a good pot maker. I alfo carried a taik-r, 
 who confented to flay in my plantation, and proved a moil 
 necefTary fellow in the ifland. As to my carjjo, it confifted 
 of a fuftk'ent quantity cf linen, rnd Englith fluffs for cloth- 
 ing the Spaniards that I expected to find there ; as likewife 
 gloves, hats, (hoes, (lockings ; together withbeds, bedding, 
 and houfehold fluff, efpecially kitchen utenfils, with pots, 
 kettles, pewter, brafs, &c. alfo nails, tools of all forts, 
 flaples, ho^ks, hinges, and all oiher things neceffary ; all 
 which, I think, cofl me about thr e hundred pounds. Nor 
 was this all; for I carried a hundred fpare arms, mufkets, 
 and fufees, be(ides fome piflols, a confiderable quantity of 
 feveral forts of fhot, two brafs cannon, befides fwcrds, 
 cutlafles, and the iron part of fome pikes and halberts. I 
 made my nephew take with us twa fmall quarter-deck 
 gurs, more than lie had occafion for in his (hip, to leave be- 
 Mrd, if tbere was a neceiTity; fo that we might build a 
 fort i here, and man it ag*inft all oppofers whatfoever. 
 
 Well, we put out to fea; and though I can't fay this 
 voyage was to unprofperous as my others had been, y^t 
 contrary winds drove us fo far northward, that we were 
 obliged to pot in at Galway in Ireland, where we lay 
 wind-bound two and twenty days. Here, indeed, our pro- 
 
 
 vifions were very cheap, and we added to our (hip's (lores 
 by taking feverd live hogs, two cws and calve>, which i 
 then refolded to put on ihore in my ifhod, if our peceffities 
 did not caii for them. On the 5th of February we failed 
 from Ireland, with a very fa ; r gale, which lafted ior fome 
 days ; and { fhink it was about the 20.h of the Tame mOoth,- 
 Jate in the evening, when the mate informed us, that he 
 faw a Bafh of fire, and heard a gun tired ; and when he wa* 
 fpeaking, a boy camein and tolJ us, taat the boatfwain had 
 heard another. Upon which we all ran to the quarter deck, 
 from Wience, in a few moments, we perceived a terribis 
 fire ac a diitance. We had immediately recourfe to our 
 reckonings, in which we were all of opinion, that there 
 could be nj land that way, i: appeiring to be at N. N. W, 
 Hereupon we concluded thac Coma ihip had taken fire at

 dropped down, as it were, without life, *nd to every one's ap- 
 pearance qoite ce*d ; but the furgeon chafing and rubbing 
 his arm, opened a veio, which at fir ft dropped, and then 
 flowing more freely, the old man began to open bis tyes 9 
 ad in a quarter of an hour was well again. But fodn re- 
 membering this happy change, the j y of which whirled his 
 blond sbout fafter than the veffels could convey it, he be- 
 came fo feverifh, as made him more fit fcr bedlam than any 
 other place ; but the furgeon giving him a fheping dofe, 
 he was perfectly compofed the next morning. 
 
 Remarkable, indeed, was the behaviour of the young 
 ftTdti At his entrance on board the fliip, he fell on his face 
 
 
 in the mo! humble probation (a the Almighty. I thotrghr, 
 indeed, he hai faijen ioco a fwoon, and fo r*n to help him

 great fcrioufoefs and affection^ while the teirs (tood in his

 did he lef* fhow his piety and wifaom, in applying himfelf 
 to his co an try people, and labouring to Co npofe -them, by 
 the moil powerful reafons* arguments, and peifu^frns. — 
 Ar-d when, indeed, ikefe people had taken their night** re* 
 priz, in fuch lodgings as our flvip would allow, we found 
 90tni*g bat the bed of manners, and she rnoii civil acknow- 
 ledgments, for which the French are eminently remarkable/ 
 The next day the baptain and one of ihe prieits ce fired tJ 
 /peak with me and my nephew the corhmitidfef, They 
 sold us, that they had faved fome m ne and val^blc things , 
 out or' the ruined veifd, whlsh was a: cur fervice; only 
 that they defue-i to be tht on (ho re' feia^ ^hztt in our way. 
 At th^ firft my nephew was for accepting the money ; but 
 I (who knew how hard my cafe would have been, had the 
 
 . Portuguese Captain ferved me fo) perfuaded him to the con- 
 trary j and therefore told them, that as .we had done nothing 
 but what we were obliged to do, by nature and humanity, 
 and what we c.u rfe'ves might expect from others in fuc-i 
 caiarrity, fo we took them up to fav*e them, not to plunder 
 
 ' them, or leaye .them naked upon the land, to perilh for 
 want of fuhfiftence, and therefore wcuid not accept their 
 inoivey : but as to lancing them, that was a great difficulty; 
 for being bound to the La it Indies, it was impoflible wil- 
 fully to change our voyage upon the : r particular account, 
 nor coald my, nephew (who was under charter-party to 
 pmfue it by way of Brazil) anfwer it to the freighters. — 
 All that we ecu Id do, was to put outfelves in the way cf 
 meeting ibmo (hips homeward-bound from the Weft Indies, 
 that, if pciTible, they might get a paffage to France or 
 England. Indeed, They were very thankful for our firjfc 
 kinonefs; but were under great concern, efpecinliy the 
 paiTengers, at their bung carried io the Ealt : Indies, '^hzy 
 begged., therefore, 1 wcuid keep on the bar.k*. of Newfound- 
 lan-d, where probably , they might meet with fome ihip or 
 pi to Ettxy them to Canada, whence they came. As 
 
 G 4- 
 
 
 tYis was but a reasonable requeft, I was inclined to grant it, 
 fince it was no breach of charter-party, and the laws of God 
 and nature obliged us to do what good we could to our 
 fellow-creatures and bcfides the danger we ourfelves 
 fhould be in for want of pro vifi bits : fo we confented to 
 carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would 
 permit; if rot, that we fhould carry them to Martinico in 
 the Weft Indies. But, as it happened, in a week's time 
 we, made the banks of Newfoundland, where- the French 
 people hired a bark to carry them to France. But the foung 
 pnetf being defirous to go to the Jtfaft Indie?, I readily agreed 
 to it, becaufe I liked his convrrfation, aid two or three of 
 i«.e French fa tors alfo entered themfelves on board our fhip. 
 
 Now, directing our courfe for the Weft Indies, fie: rin'* 
 S, snd S. by &-.. about twenty days, with little win:!, a^o- 
 tfcjbr ad venture, happered to exercife our humanity. In the 
 latitude of 27 degrees, 5 minutes north, the 19th of March, 
 1694-5, we perceived a fail, (our courfe S. E. and by S.) 
 which bore upon us, snd then (he appeared to be a large 
 vefl'ef, having loft her imin tcp-matl *nrf bolifprit; when 
 firing a gun as a figr.al o< diftrefs, wind N. N. W. we foon 
 eame rofpeak with her. She was a fhip from Brift. 1, bound 
 home from Barbadoes, out of which road (he had been forced 
 in a hurricane to the weflward, in which they k ft their 
 marts. 
 
 They told us, their expectations were to fee the Bahama 
 jflands, but were % J riven away by a ftrong wind at N. N. W. 
 and having no fails to work the (hip with, but the main- 
 courfe, and a kind of a fqu are fail upon a jmy fore-maft, 
 becaufe they could not come near the land, were endeavour- 
 ing to (land for the Canaries : nay, what was worTe. befides 
 ali their fatigue, they were almoft flarved for uant of pro- 
 viftcn, having ate nothing for e'even days ; all that they had 
 aboard was figar. a barrel of frefh water, and feven cafks 
 of rum. In this fliip were palfengers, a ycuth, his mother, 
 and a maid-fervam, wr o were in a mod df plorab > condition 
 for want of food. If I had not gone on board IheiriTrp, 
 the knowledge cf their mifery had been concealed from me, 
 and they would have inevitably perifhed, though, indeed, 
 their fecond mate who was Captain, by reafon the true 
 Captain was not on board when the hurricane happened, 
 had cefore informed me that there were fuch perfons on 
 board, whom he fuppofed to be dead, being afraid to inquire 
 
 
 after them, becaofe he had nothing to give them for re'ief. 
 Hereupon we refolved to let them have- what we could 
 {pare, ordering the mate to bring form* of his mtn on board 
 ti5, which he did accordingly: as he and they looked like 
 fkeletcns, when meat was fet before them 1 ordered them 
 to eat fparin^ly. But, however, they foon fell ikk ; which 
 obliged the furgecn to mix fomethir.g in their broth, which 
 was to be to them both food and phytic. When they were 
 fed, we ordered our mate to carry thrn a fack of bre.:>% 
 and fcur or five pieces of beef; but the furgeon chirked 
 them to fee it boilei, and keep a guard on the cock-room, 
 to prevent the men from eating it raw, and confequeiuly 
 killing themfelves with what was -cefigned for their relief. 
 But, p-auicubrly, I defired the mate to fee what condition 
 the poor pafTengers were in, and the furgeon gave him a 
 pitcher of the fame broth which he had prepared for th^ 
 men. Afcd being curious to Tee this fce^e of mifery my fijlf, 
 I took -the Captain (as we called the mate of the lliipj in 
 our own boat, and fa led after ihem.> 
 
 Here was a fad fi>ht indeed 1 Scarce -were the victuals 
 half boiled in the pot, but they were ready to break-open  
 the cook room door. To ftay their itomac-hs, the mate gave 
 them bifcuits, which were dipped and foftened with the 
 liquor of the meat, which they call 6ru//e ; .tel'.i^g th^m it 
 was for their own fafety, that he was o^b iged to give chem 
 but a little at a time ; and fo feeding them gradually, their r 
 bellies were comfortably filled, and themm did very well 
 again. But when they came to the p^or gentlewoman id 
 the cabin, who for feveral days had continued without food, 
 giving what (he had to her fon, they found her, as it were, 
 in the arms of death. She was tilting upon ihe Boof of.'ihe 
 deck, with her back up againft the iid?s, between twj 
 chairs, which were !a(hed fait, and her head fhrunk b- 
 ivreen her moulders, like a fenielefs corpfe. Nothing was 
 ^•antingtn my mite to revive and encourage htr ; openi g 
 hr lips, and putting fome bvAh in:o her mouth. witn a tpoon. 
 But n?t having Jbength to fpe^k., the lifted up her head 
 with much difficulty, intimating that it was now too late ; 
 at the fame time pointing to the youth, her fon, as though 
 (he defired him to do what he cou'd to fave the lad ; 'an>l> 
 in a little time after, the died. 
 
 The youth, indeed, was not fo far gp-e, yet lay flr?iched 
 qu; on the cabin bed, like, ens that had fcatce any HiV. Id 
 
 Go 
 
 
 . his mouth was a p'ece of an old glove, the reft of which he 
 had ate up. At fir ft he vomited what the mate had gi/en 
 him ; but at length b/gan (enfibly to revive, though in the 
 greate(t concern for the death of his tender mother. 
 
 As to the poor maid, (he lay by her miftrefs, like one in 
 the lad pangs -of death : her limbs were diverted, one of her 
 hands was clafped round the frame of a chair, which fhe 
 grafped (o hard, that it was with fome difficolty we (ep*,- 
 rated he'- from it ; her other arm lay over her head, and her 
 feet lay both together, fet fail againft the frame of {he cabin 
 table ; not only being fbrved with hanger, but overcome 
 with grief at the lofs of her miOrefs, whom fhe loved molt 
 tenderly. It was a great while before the furgeon could 
 bring her to life, and a much longer time before fhe came 
 to her fenfes. 
 
 After we had failed with them fome days, we fent th?m 
 five carrels of beef, ore of pork, two hog meads of bifcuit, 
 with peas, flour, ad other things ; taking three ca/ks of 
 fugar, fome rum, and feme pi ^*es cf eight as payment, we 
 left then? 9 but took the youth and maid with us, with all 
 their goods;- The lad was about Yeventeeo years old', very 
 hsndfome, modefr, fenfible, *nd well bred, but mightily 
 concerned for the lofs cf his honoured mother, hayi g loft 
 his father at Barbadoes but a few rno~ths before. He be- 
 (eeched the forgeon ta intercede with me to take him out 
 of the fhip ; for that thefailors, by net fparinga fmail fufte- 
 nance, had ftasved his mother. But hunger has no bound*, 
 no right, and ccnfequ^-ntly is incapable of ary companion. 
 When the fgrgeorx to d h : m> our voyage might put him in 
 Fad circumfknees and -farther from his friends, he faid he 
 did not care, if he vcas delivered from that terrible crew ; 
 that as the Captain (meaning me) had faved him frcm death, 
 fo he was fure he wcu?d do him no harm ; and, as for the 
 ftiaid, when fhe was  reftcred to her fenfes, (he would ce 
 no le's thankful, let us carry them where V? would. And 
 indeed the furgeon fa reprefented their cafe to me, that I 
 confirmed, ; : took them en board, with all t u eir goods, 
 except eleven hogflfieads of fugar; but (he youth having a 
 Mi* cf li-3if!2% I made the Commander oblige himfelf to de- 
 liver a letter and the deceaftd widow's goods to Mr, Rogers, 
 a merciar- in Briftpl ; b.u* 1 believe :he ftrp was loft at fea, 
 /or we r.evej could near what became of her afterwards. 
 -We were now in Ja/titude 19 deg. 32 aVirf. having as yet a 
 
 
 tolerable good voyage; But, puffing by feverallut!e incidents 
 relating to wind and weather, I fhall relate what is moft re<* 
 markable concerning my little kingdom, to which I was 
 then drawing near. I had great difficulty in finding it, for 
 as -I came to, and went from it before, on the fouth and eafl 
 fide of the iiland, as coining from thk Brazils, fo now ap- 
 proaching between the main ajnd the iiland, not raving any 
 chart of the coafi, nor land mark, it obliged us to go on 
 fhore on feversi iilands in the mouth of the river Orconoko, 
 but to no purpofe. Thus I perceived, that tofeat I thought 
 was a continent before, was no fuch thine, but a long ifl.ind, 
 or rather a riJ£e of fnds. On one of thiife iilands I found 
 fome Spaniard?, but they belonged to \he ifle'de Trinidad, 
 who came hither in a fhftp to make fait, sni try to find 
 fome pearl rhiifcles. But at length I came hir on the 
 fo»uh-{ide of my iiland, and t: en I prefently knew the 
 countenance of my Ht'le kingdom : fo we b. ought the (hip 
 fafe to an anchor, broad'de wi.hin the creek, where Hoed 
 my ancient and venerable ca ! 'ie. 
 
 No f.one? did I fee the plfce, but- ca 1 ]ing for Friday, I 
 afked him wher£ he w&s ; D*it <* her; he locked a little, he 
 clappecl bin hands, ery^r>g, (i O - jcy-, O there, O yes, O

 G 6 
 
 
 After wc had rowed direclly into the creek, the firft man 
 I fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard, whofe life I had 
 laved, and whefe face I perfectly well knew. I ordered 
 them all to ilay in the boat for a while ; but Friday, per- 
 ceiving his father at a diftance, would have jumped into the 
 fea, had they not let the boat go. No fooner was he on 
 ihore, but he flew like a fwift arrow out of a bow to em- 
 brace his aged father. Certainly it would melt a man of 
 the firrneft refolution into the fofteft tears^ to fee with what 
 uncommon tranfports of joy he faluted him ; he firft kifled 
 him, then flroked his face, took him in his arms, laid him 
 under a ihady tree, fat down by him, then looked as ear- 
 iicfily at him, as one would do at a piclure, for a quarter of 
 an hour together. After this he would lie Upon the ground, 
 Stroke his legs and kifs them, then get up and flare at him, 
 as though he was bewitched : but the next day one could 
 not forbear laughter to fee his behaviour ; for he would walk 
 feveral hours with his father along the more, leading htm 
 by the hand, as though he was a lady ; while, every now and 
 then, he would run to the boat to get fomcihing for him, 
 as a jump of fugar, dram, bi feint, or fomething or other that 
 was good. His frolics ran in another channel in the after- 
 noon ; when he fet old Friday 01 the ground, he would 
 dance round him, making comical poflures and geftures; 
 and all this while would be tellingliim one ftory or another 
 of his travels arid adventures. 
 
 It was on the 10th of April, anno 1695i that I f t my 
 foot upon the ifland a fecond time. When my faithful 
 Spaniard, accompanied by one more, approached the boat, 
 he little knew who I was, till I discovered myfeif to him. 
 ** Seignior," faid I, in Portuguefe, " don't you know me?'* 
 He fyoke never a word, but giving his muiket to his a. tend* 
 smr, extended his arms, and faying fomething in Spanifh 
 that I did rot then underftand, li« C3me forward an i em- 
 braced me, faying, he was inexcufable net to know his de- 
 liverer, who, like an angel fent from heaven, had faved his 
 life. He then beckoned to the man to call put his com. 
 par ions ; a Iked me if I would wa<k to my own habitation, 
 and take pofTefiTion, where I mould find f me mean im- 
 provements.; but indeed they were extraordinary ones ; A>r 
 they had planted fo many trees fo clofe together, that the 
 place was like a Jabyiinth, whxh rone could find out ex* 
 cept ihsiTifeivt's., \»ho k r :cw its intricate windings. I afkeel 
 
 
 him the meaning of all thefe fortifications? be told me he 
 would give a large account of what had palled fince ray 
 departure till this time, and how he had fubdued fome Eng- 
 Jim, who thought to be their murderers, hoping I would 
 no; be dKpleafed, fmce neccflky compelled them to it. — 
 As I knew they were wicked villains, fo i told him, that I 
 was not only far from finding fault with it, but was rather 
 heartily glad that they had fubdued them. While we were 
 thus^alking, the man whom he fent, returned, accompanied 
 by e'even more, but in fuch habits, that it was impoflible 
 to tell what nation they were of. Hs firil turned" to me, 
 and pointing to them, " Thefe, Sir," faid he, "are fome of 
 the gentlemen who owe their lives to your goodnefs;" then 
 turning to them, and pointing to me, he made them fen is- 
 ble wno I was; and then indeed they faluted me one by 
 one, not as ordinary men, but as though ihcy had been am- 
 baiiadors or noblemen, and I a triumphant conqueror ; for 
 their behaviour rot only agreed with a manlike, majefHc 
 gravity, but at the fame time was fo obliging and courteous, 
 as made them agreeable to the la'l degree. 
 
 Before I relate the hiftory of the tranfictions of my king- 
 dom, as I had it from the Spaniard's own mouth, I mult 
 h«re/infert what I omitted in my former relation. The 
 matter is this : Jufl befoe we weighed anchor and fet fail, 
 there happened a quarrel oa board the (hip, which had HU>to 
 have occafioned a fecond mutiny, till fuch time as the cou- 
 rageous Capta'n, taking two of the moil refractory priioners, 
 laid them in irons, threatening, as they were concern d ia 
 the former difoiders, to have them hanged in England for 
 Timnirg away with the fhip. This frightened fome of the 
 reft, as thinking the Cap ain would (er\Q them in the 
 fame rr>anner, though he feemed to give them good words 
 for the prefenr* But the mate having intelligence of this, 
 made me acquainted with their fears; fo that, to make 
 them Riore eaiy, and our (rives more fafe from their confpi- 
 ra"eies, I was obliged to go down, ar.«d pafs my honour's 
 word for i*, that upon their good behaviour, all that was 
 part ihould be forgiven ; in tetfimony of which, I ordered 
 the two men's irors to be taken off, and themfelves for- 
 given. But i'.s this had brought us to an anchor at night, 
 in which there was a calm, the two men that had been in 
 irons, flcle each of them a mufket, and fome other weapons, 
 -and taking the & p's pinnace, not ye: hauled up, ran uwa/ 
 
 
 to the^r brother rogues. Tine next morning we fent the 
 )ong-boar, with men to purfue the<r>, but aH in vain ; the 
 mate, in revenge, would nave demolifhed rny little caitie, 
 burnt its furniture, acd deftroyed their plantations, but 
 having no orders for it, he did not put it in execution. — 
 And thus there were five Englifhmen in the ifland, which 
 caufed great differences, as rny faithful Spaniard gave rne a 
 perfed account of, in the following manner: 
 
 "You cannot, Sir, but remember the einbafly you fent - 
 
 x me about, and what a disappointment we met with, by fp&r 
 abfence, at cur return. There' is b it little 'variety in the 
 relation of al! cur voyage, being bit fled with cairn weather, 
 and a fmoctii fea. Great indeed was the joy of my coun- 
 trymen to fee me alive, having acted as the p incipal man 
 on board, the Captain if the fhipwrecked vcflel dying before; 
 nor was their furprife lefs, as knowing I was taken prisoner 
 by thefavages or another nation, they had thought me long 
 fnte entombed in their .rricud reus bowels. But when I 
 mowed them the arms,' griiliiunmon, and rrovifions i had 
 brought for them, they Jooked upon me as a fecond Jofep'h 
 advanced in Pharaoh's court, and immediately prepared to 
 come aicng with me. indeed they were obliged to irefpafs 
 upon (heir * friendly favagts, by borrowing two 6f their 
 canoes, under a pretext for filling; and they Came away 
 the next morning, hut w the ut any pfoVifiorJs of their own, 
 except a few rc'6|s> which ier---td them rhfiead of bre^d.— 
 After three weeks abfence, we a; r.riv d ic our habitation,

 looked upon as the r . :, 'it not in your abfencd^iideavour o 
 
 pcrfuade them to take them in, that we might be as one family; 
 
 
 bat all our entreaties were in vain, fa that the poor fellows 
 finding nothing to be done without induftry, pitched their 
 tents ofi the, north fide of the iiland, a little inclining to the 
 weit, for fear of fa vale's, Here they built two huts, one to 
 lod ge, and the other to }ay their llores in ; for my good natur- 
 ed Spaniard giving them fome feeds, they dug and planted 
 as I had done, and began to live prettily. But while they 
 were thus comfortably going on, the three unnatural brutes, 
 their countrymen, in a mere bullying humour, infuhed them, 
 by fiyrng, the governor (meaning you) had given them 
 poiTeiTion of the iiland, and d — mn'etn they mould band no 
 houfes upon their ground, without paying rent. Tne two 
 honelt men (for (o let me now diftingu-ih them) thought their 
 three countrymen only jelled, and one of them invired them 
 in, to fee their fine hab taiions; while the o her faeetioufly 
 told them, that fince they built tenements with great im- 
 provements, they fhould, according to the cuilom of lords, 
 give them a longer leafe; at rhe fame time defiring them to 
 fetch a fcrivener to draw the writings. One of thefc 
 wretches fwearing he fhotfid piy for flae jefi, matches up a 
 lire-brand, and clapping it to the ou fide or their hut, very 
 fairly fet it on fire, which wou;d loon have cmfumei it, 
 had not the honeft man thruft him away, a~d trod it out 
 W^th his feet. Hereupon the fel>ow returns with his pole, 
 with which he would have ended hi3 davs, had not the 
 poor man avoided the blow, when fetching his mufket, he 
 knocked down tlie villain th it began vbe quarrel. The 
 other t#o coming to a (fid their fellow, obliged the he e(fc 
 man to take his niufket alfp, and both nf them prelecting 
 their pieces, bid ihe viihins Hand off ; and if t.iey did not 
 lay dovvn their arms, death fhou'd decide the difpute one 
 way cr other. This brought them to i parley, in which 
 they agreed to t : ke their wouiVdfed man and be gone ; but 
 they were in the wrong that rhey dii not difarrti them when 
 they had the power, and iHen >.r?,ke, their conp ! a'nt to me 
 an i rny Spaniards for jo (lie**, v* hich might have p ; evented 
 their farther designs agair.lt them. Aoj^ indeed, io miny 
 Ir'efpsiTes did they after WaWs commit, by trending dovva 
 their corn, (Hooting their young kids and goas, and plagu- 
 ing them night and day, thst they refoived to come to niy 
 cai.lf, Challenge a;i the thne, and decide tiieir r'-ght by one 
 plain ba"tJe, While the Spaniards :tood by to fee rair piay. 
 Oae dzy U ksppeued, that -;wo of my Spaniards (one of 
 
 
 whom understood Englifh) being in the woods, were met 
 by one of the honefl men, who complained how barbarous 
 their countrymen hid been in deftroying their corn* killing 
 their milk-goat, and three kids, which deprived them of their 
 fubfiftencc ; and that if we did rot grant them relief, they 
 rouft be inevitably ftarved, and fo they parted ; but when 
 my Spaniards came home at night, and fupper being on the 
 table, one of them began to reprehend the Englifhmen, but 
 in a very mannerly way; which they reienting, replied, 
 *' Whatbufinefs had their countrymen in that place without 
 leave, when it was none of their ground r" *' Why," faid 
 my Spaniard, calmly, " Inglife, they mull not fiarve;" but 
 they replied, u Let them ftarve, and be damn'd, they fhould 
 neither plant nor build; and damn them, jthey fhould be 
 their fervants, and work for them, for theifla*d was theirs, 
 and they would burn all the huts they fhould find in the 
 ifland." " By this rule," faid my Spaniard, fmiling, *« We 
 fhall be your fervants too." " Aye, by G — d f and fo you 
 fhali," replied the impudent rafcal. Up/>n which, flaring.: 
 up, Will Atkins cries, f( Gome, Jack, let's have t'other. 
 brufh with them, who dare to build in our dominions!"— 
 Thus leaving as fomething heated with juft paffion, away 
 they trooped, every man having a gun, piftol, and fword> 
 muttering fore threatening words, that we could then but* 
 imperfeclly underftand. That n ; ght they deigned to mur- 
 der their two companion*, and flept till midnight in the 
 bower, thinking to fall upon them in their fleep; nor were 
 the honefl men lefs thoughtful corceming them; for at this 
 juncture they were coming to find them cut, burin a much 
 fairer way. As foon as the villains came to the huts, and 
 found nobody there, they concluded that land my Spaniard 
 had given thefo notice, and therefore fwore to be revenged 
 on us. Then they demoliihrd the poor men's habitations ; 
 not by fire as they attempted before, but puHed dewn their 
 houfes limb from limb, not leaving flick or llone on the 
 ground where they flood, broke their h ufehold fluff; in- 
 pieces, tore up their trees, fpoiled their enclofure, and, in 
 fhort, quite ruined them of every thing they had. Had 
 thefe people met together* no doubt but there would have 
 been a blcody battle; but Providence ordered it for the 
 better; for jufl as the three were got together, the two 
 were at our caftlc ; and when they left us, the three came 
 back again, but in great rage, fcoffingly telling us what 
 
 
 they had done; when one taking hold of a Spaniard's ha% 
 twirls it round, faying, "And you, Seienior Jack Spaniard, 
 frail have the fame fauce, if you don't mend your manners.'* 
 My Spaniard, a grave but courageous man, knocked him 
 down with one blow of lvs fift; at which another villain 
 fired his piilol, and narrowly miffed his body, but wounded 
 him a little in the ear. Hereat enraged, the Spaniard tikes 
 op the fellow's muiket whom he had knocked down, and 
 would have fhot him, if I and the reft had not come out, 
 and taken their arms from every one of them. 
 
 "Thefe Englishmen perceiving they had made all of us 
 th^ir enemies, began to cool; but notwithitandina: their 
 bitter words, the Spaniards would not return them their 
 arms a^ain, telling them they would do then no manner of 
 harm, if th~y would live peaceably ; but if thev offe'e-i any 
 injury to the plantation or caitie, they would fhoot them as 
 t^ey would da ravenous besfls. This made them fo mad, 
 th*t they went away raging like furies of hell. They were 
 no fooner gone, but in cam? the two honefl men, fired witH 
 the juiteil rag?, if fuch can be, having being ruined as afore- 
 fai.d. And indeed, it was very hard, that nineteen of us 
 fhould be bullied by three villains, continually offending 
 with impunity. 
 
 " It was a great while, Sir, before we could perfuade the 
 two Engliih men from purfuing, and undoubtedly kdiing 
 tiem wkh their fire-arms; but we prdmifedS themjaltice 
 fiiruld be do >e them; and, in the mean time, they ihould 
 fefide'w'th us in our habitation. In about five days after, 
 thefe three vagrant*, aimoit ttarved with hunger, drew near 
 our grove, and perceiving m*, the governor, and twoothers 
 walking by the fide of the creek, they very fubmitfively 
 deiired to be received into the family again. We told 
 them of their great incivility to us, and ot their unnatural 
 barbarity to their countrymen ; but yet we would fee what 
 the reft agreed to, ad in half an hour's time would bring 
 them word. After fame debate, we called them in, where 
 their two countrymen iaid a heavy charge againil: them, 
 for not only ruining, bat defigning to murder them, which 
 they could not deny. But here I was forced to interpofe 
 as a mediator, by obliging the two Engliih men not to hurt 
 them, .being naked and unarrried ; and that the other three 
 fhould make them rcftitation, by building their two hu:s, 
 
 
 -arid -fencing their ground in the fame manner as it was be- 1 
 fore. Weil, being in a mlferabl  condition, they fub'mitted 
 to this at prcfent, and lived fbmfr time regularly enough, j 
 except as to the working part, which they did hot mte far, ! 
 hot the Spaniards would have difpenfed with that, *a * they  
 continued ealy and quiet. Their arms being giv. r he"m 
 agam, they "fcarcs had them a week when they be:, . if as [ 
 trooblefffme as ever; but an accident happening 'feu ; r er, | 
 ©bl'g- d us to lay afide private refentrnents, and look to our 
 common prefervaiien 
 
 *• One night, Sir, I went to bed, perfectly well i "ealth, 
 and yet by no means could I compote myfeif to %fep ; up- n 
 which, being very uneafy, I got up and locked o:':. ui *t 
 beitig c a r k ^ I could perceive ? ~othitig but he rees ar nd 
 tHe caftle. I went to b.d a?aii?, but t w^s all one, 1 c old 
 not ileep; when one of my Scania? 8 3 hearing me w/lk 
 about, alked who w~s up? I anfwe^ed, u It is I." When 
 J told him ?he cecals, < 4 Sir," (ad he, "fueh things are 
 not to ^e flighted ; (or Certainly there is forne mtfehief plot- 
 ling ag-unft us." "Where. a*e t ;e Er.g idvnen ?" (&\d I. 
 Ide anfwered, {f In. -their huts; for they lay fepuate from 
 us, Sir, fince- the laffi. mutiny" €i -Well," (aid I> " feme 
 kind fpirit gives this information for advantage. Come let 
 us go abroad, and fee if anv thing ofTers to jufiify our fears." 
 Upon which I and feme of my Spaniards went up t he 'moun- 
 tain,' r;oi by the ladder, but through the grove, and»then-we 
 were ftruck with a panic fear on feeing a Iigh:, as though 
 it were a fire, at *£ very little diftance, and hearing thfe 
 voices of feverai men. Hereupon we retreated immediate- 
 ly, and raifed the reft of our forces, and made them fenfible 
 of the impending darger; but with all my authority,! could 
 not make then? ftay where they were, fo earneft were they 
 to fee how things went/ Indeed, the darknefs of the night 
 gave them opportunity enough to view them by the light cf 
 the fire, undifecvered. As they were in different parties, 
 atd draggling over the fhore, we v*ere much afraid that 
 they mould find out our habitations, and deftroy our flecks 
 of goats; to prevent which, we fent immediately an Eng- 
 lishman and two Spaniards to drive the goats into the val- 
 ley where the cave lay ; or, if there was occafion, into the 
 Cave itfelf : As to ourfeives, returning our r.atiye courage 
 and prudent conduct, had we not been divided, we duril 
 venture to att«ck a hundred of them; but before it was 
 
 
 Very light, We refolved to fend out Friday's father as a fpy, 
 who, immediately Stripping himfelf naked, ^ets among them 
 undifcowred* and in two hours tme, brings word, that they 
 Were two part'es of two different nations, who lately having 
 a bloody battle with one another, happened to land by mere 
 chance in the fame ifland, to devour their miferable pri- 
 foners ; that they were entirely ignorant, of a.ny perions 
 inhabiting here; but rather being tilled with rage and fury 
 againil one another, he believed, that as foon as day-light 
 appeared, there would be a terrible engagem^.t. Old Fri- 
 day ha i fcarce ended his relation, when we heard an un- 
 common noife, an i perceived that there was a horrid en- 
 gageme.'it between the two armies. 
 
 "Such was the enrioiity of our party, efpecially the Eng- 
 lifhrnen, that they would not lieciofe, thoughOld Friday to!d 
 them their fafeiy depended upon it; and .that if we had 
 patience, we fliould behold the favages kill oae another. 
 However they ufed form caanon, by going farther into 
 the woods, and placing themfeives in a convenient place to 
 beh. Id the batt-e. 
 
 " Never could there be a more bloody engagement, or 
 men of rfi©re invincible fpiri s and prudent conduct, ac- 
 cording to their manner and way of fighting. It laded near 
 two hours, rill the party which was nearer our caftle began 
 to dedire, aad at iafl to fly from their conquerors. We 
 were undoubtedly put into a great conilernarion on this 
 account, leit they mould run into our grove, and c mfe- 
 quem! bring us iflto the like danger. Hereupon we re- 
 iolved to kill the fir ft that came, to prevent difcovery, and 
 that too with our fwords, and the butt ends 'of our mufkeis, 
 i:r fear the report of our guns fliould be heard. 
 
 u And fo indeed 1 , as we thought, it happened ; for thrse 
 of the vanquifhed army eroding the creek, ran directly to 
 the place, as -to a thick wood for fheker ; nor was it long 
 before our fcout gave us notice of it; as aifo, that the vic- 
 tors did not think fit to puffue tktiti. Upon this I would 
 not fuller them to be llain, but had them furprfei and taken 
 by our party; afterwards they proved very good fervants 
 to us, being flout young ereuures, and able to do a great 
 deal of wcrk. The remainder of the conquered favages 
 fled to their dances, ar.d put out into the ocean, while the 
 conquercrs, joining together, Ihcuted by way of triumph ; 
 
 
 and about three in the afternoon they alfo embarked (or 
 their own country. Thus we weft freed at once from thofc 
 f&vages and our fears, not prrceivirg any of thefe creatures 
 for fome confiderable time after. We found two and thirty 
 men dead in the field of battle; fome were (lain with long 
 arrows, wh'tch we found flicking in their bodies ; and the 
 reft, were killed with great un'wieldly woodens fwords, which 
 denoted their valt ilrength, and of which we found feven- 
 teen, befides bows and arrows; but we could not fid one 
 wounded creature among them alive ; for they either kill 
 their enemies quite, cr carry thofe wounded away with 
 them. 
 
 4; Tais terrible fight tamed the Engliihmen for f>me time, 
 co^fidering h w unrortana e they might have been had they 
 fallen ino their hands, who would not only kill them as 
 enemies, but alfo for food, as we do caitle: and indeed fo 
 much did this naufeate their stomachs, that it not only made 
 the™ very lick, but more tractable \o the common necefTary 
 bufinefs of the whole fociety, planting, fowing, and reap- 
 ing » with the grecteil (igns of amity and fr iendihip ; !o> 
 that being now ail good fri-. nds, we began to confider of 
 circumfhnces in general j and the firft thing we thought 
 of was, whether, as we perceived the favages haunted t^at 
 fide of the iilancf, and there being mora retired parts of k r 
 and yet as well fuited to our manner of living, and equally 
 to oar advantage, we ought not rather to move oar place 
 of refidence, and plant it in a mucn fafer place* both for 
 the fecurity of our corn and cattle. 
 
 u After a long debate on this head, it was refolved, or 
 rather voted nemine contradiccnte, not to remove our ancient 
 caftle, and that for this very ^ood reason, that fonie time 
 or other we -ex peeled to h^ar from cur fuprem- governor, 
 (meaning you, Sir,) wh»fe meiTengers not finding ustiere, 
 might think the place demoltliied, and all his -fubjecls de- 
 ilroyed by the favages. 
 
 _ " As to the rext concern relating to our cc rn ard cattle, 
 we confentrd to have them removed to the valley where 
 the cave was, that being mod proper and fuflicient for both. 
 But yet, when we confidered farther, we altered one pa t 
 of our refolution, which was to remove part of our cattle 
 thither, and plant only part of our corn there; fo that in 
 c»fe one part was deitroyed, the other mi>ht be preferved. 
 Anothtr refolution we took/ which really had a great deal 
 
 
 of prudence in it, and that was, in not trufling the three 
 favages whom «c had taken priion^rs, with any knowledge 
 of the plantations we had made in the valley, of what num- 
 ber of cattle we had there, much lefs of the cave, wherein 
 we kept feveral arm?, and two barrels of powder )ou left 
 for us at ycur departure from ths illand. But though wc 
 cold not change our habitation, we refolved to make it 
 more fortified and mere fecure. To - this end, Sir, as you 
 planted trees at fame diftance before the entrance of your 
 palace; fo we, imitating your example, planted and filled 
 up_tfce whole fpace of ground, even to the banks of the 
 creek, nay, into the very ooze where the tide flowed, not 
 leaving a place for landing ; and among thofe i had planted, 
 they had intermingled io many iriort ones, all of which 
 growing wonderfully fafl and thick, a litde dog could 
 fcarcely find a pafTage through them. Nor was this fuffi- 
 cicnt, as we thought, for we did the fame to all the ground 
 ori the ripht and left hand of us, even to the top of the hill, 
 without fo much as leaving a pafiage for ourfelves, except 
 by the ladder, which being taken down, nothing but what 
 had wing8 or witchcraft could pretend to come near us. 
 And indeed this was exceedingly well contrived, efpecially 
 to ferve that cccafion, for which we afterwards found it 
 neceflary. 
 
 " Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement, bav- 
 in?, all this time, not one vilit from ihe f»vages. Indeed 
 one morning we had an alarm, which put us in fome amaze- 
 ment ; for a few of my Spaniards being out very early, 
 perceived no lefs than twenty canoes, as it were, coming 
 on ihore : upon which returning home with great precipi- 
 tation, they gave us the alarm, which obliged us to keep 
 at home aU that day and thje next, going cut only in the 
 night-rime to make our cbfervations ; but, as good luck 
 would have it, they were upon another delign, and did not 
 land that time upon the ifland. 
 
 u But row there happened sno;her quarrel between the 
 three wicked Englifhmen, arid fome of my Spaniards. — 
 The occafion was this : One of them being enraged at one 
 of the favage?, wJiom he had taken prifoner, for not bring 
 able to comprehend fomcthing which he was ihowing him, 
 fnatched u j a hatchet in a g eat fury, rot to correct, but to 
 kill him ; jet m» fling his head, gve him fuch a barbarous 
 cut in the lhould r that he had like to have (truck off his 
 
 
 arm; at which one of my gcod-natured Spaniards inter- 
 pofing between the Englifhman and the favage, befeeched 
 the former npt to murder the poor creature ; but this kind- 
 nefs had like to have coft the Spaniard his life, for the 
 Englifhman itruck at him in the fame manner ; which he 
 nimbly snd wifely avoided, returning fuddenly upon him 
 with his (hovel, (being ail at work about their corn land,) and 
 vrry fairly knocked the brutifh creature down. Hereupon 
 another Englifhman coming to his fellow's affiftance, laid the 
 good Spaniard on the earth; when immediately two ethers 
 coming to his relief, were attacked by the third Englifbn^n, 
 armed with an old cutlafs, who wounded them both. This 
 uproar foon reached our ears, when, we rufhing out upon 
 them, took th three Englishmen prifoners, and then our next 
 qusfticn was, what fhouid be done to fuch mutinous and 
 impudent fellows, fo furious, defperaie, and idle, that they 
 were mifchievous to the huheft degree, and consequently 
 not fsfe for the fociety to let them Hve among them. 
 
 " Now, Sir, as I was a governor in your «\bfence, fo I alfo 
 took the authority of a judge; and having them brought 
 before me, I told them, that if they had been of my country, 
 I would have hanged every mother's fon of them; but, 
 fince it was an Englifhman, (meaning you, kind. Sir,) to 
 whom we were indebted for cur prefervation and deliver- 
 ance, I would, in gratitude, ufe them with all poifible mild- 
 nefs; but; at the fame time, leaving them to the judgment of 
 the other two Englifhmen, who, I hoped, forgetting their 
 referitments, wculd deal impartially by them. 
 
 "Hereupon one of his countrymen flood up: €l Sir/' 
 faid he, " leave it not to us, for you nuy be fenfible we 
 have reafon to fentence them to the gall ws : befides, Sir, 
 this fellow, Will Atkins, and the two others, p-.opofed to us, 
 that we might murder you ail in your fltep, which we could 
 not c.nfen to : tut kr owing their inability, 'and )our vigi- 
 lance, we d]6 riot think fit to difcover it before rovv." 
 
 "Now, §ei££foi*" laid I, ** do you hear what is alleged 
 again!* you? What can you fa'v'to juft-ify (o rurrid an action-. 
 as to murder us in cold blo^d?" So fr, Sir, w*-..s the wrech

 faid 1 ; if or what wilj you gain by killing Uo r What iha)l

 Why will you, Seignior A kins," faid I, fouling, <f pu; us tQ 
 
 
 fijcb an unhappy dilemma, fuch a fatal necefTity ?"' But fo 
 great a rage did my fcoffing and yet fevere j ^ft, put him 
 into, thac foe yvas g-ojng to fly at me, and undoubtedly had* 
 attempted o kSl me it he had been porTeiied of weapons,

 fcif r o w.xs m> deliverer; and as merciful c-unfeL are 
 moil prevailing- wren earnestly prefied, fo 1 gut them to be 
 of the f.me opinion as to clemency. But to prevent them 
 doing us ay farther mifekief, we all agreed, that they ihould 
 have .weapons, as fvvod, gun, powder, or fhoi, but be 
 expelled rrpm (hefoeiety, to live as they pleaied by the*i- 
 fefves; thai n;i.her the two Englishmen, nor the reft of the 
 Spaniards, ih utd nave converfation with them upon any ac- 
 count whatfeeyer $ that they ihould be kept from coming 
 within a certain d'itance of our caftle ; and if tney dared 
 to offer us any violence, either by fpoiling, burning, killing 
 or defttoying any of the cor:;, plantings, building . fences, 
 cr cattle, belonging to the fociety, we would ihoot mem as 
 freely as we would ao beads of prey, in whatsoever places' 
 weTnould fi d them. 
 
 u Thss fenterce feenied very juft to all but themfelves; 
 when, like a merciful j idg'e, I called out to the two honeit 
 Englifnrnen, faying " You muft confider they ought not to 
 be thrved, nek. er; and fmce it will be fome time before they 
 can raife corn and cattle of their own, let us'give ueni fomer 
 
 I corn to tail them eight months, and for feed to fow, by which 
 time they'll raife fome for themfeives; let us alfo bellow 
 upon them tix milch goats, four he ones, and fixkbs, as- 
 
 i Veil for their prefent (u^pport, as for a further increaf-; 
 with tools necefiary for their work, as hatchets, an axe, faw, 
 and other things convenient to build them huts : all whica 
 were agreed : but before they took them into pc fie (lion, I 
 obliged them folemnly to fwear, never to attempt any thing 
 eg da ft us, cr their countrymen, for the future. Thus dit- 
 
 
 miffing them from our fociety, they went away, fullen an<l 
 refractory, as though neither willing to go ror (lay - how- 
 ever feeing ro remedy, they took what provision was given 
 them, propofing to choofe a convenient place where they 
 mighr live by themfelves. 
 
 4 « About five days after, they came to thofe limits appoint- 
 ed, in order for more victuals, and fent me word by one of 
 my Spaniards, whom they called to, where they had pitched 
 their tents, and marked themfelves out a habitation and 
 plantation, at the N. E. and moll remote part of the ifland. 
 And, indeed, there they built themfelves two very handfome 
 cottages, refembling our little caftle, being under the fide of 
 a mountain, with foir.e trees already growing on three fides 
 of it ; fo that planting a few more, it would be obfeured from 
 light, unleis particularly fought for. When thefe huts were 
 iiniuVd, we £ave them feme dry goat fkins for bedding and 
 covering; and upon their giving us fuller a iTurarces of their 
 good behaviour lor the future, we gave them fome peas, bai- 
 ley, and rice for fewing, and whatever toota we could fpare. 
 "Six months did they live in this feparate condition, in 
 which they got their firfl harveft in, the quantity of which 
 was but final], becaufe they had planted but little Und; for, 
 indeed, ail their plantations being to form, made it mere 
 difficult, efpecially as it was a thing out of their element \ 
 and when they were obliged to make their boards aud pots, 
 &c. they could make little or nothing of it. But the rainy 
 feafon coming on, put them into a greater perplexity, for 
 want of a cave to keep their corn dry, and prevent it from 
 fpoifing: and fo much did this humble them, that they beg- 
 ged of my Spaniards to help them, to which the good-natured 
 men readily confented, and in four days fpace, wo ked a 
 great hole in the {\6e of the hill for them, large enough for 
 their purpofe, to fecure the^r corn and other things from the 
 jain, though not comparable to ours, which had ieveral ad- 
 ditional apartments. 
 
 fi But a r,ew whim pofTeffed thefe rogues about three 
 quarters of a year after, which had like to have ru ned us, 
 «nd themfelves too; for it feems, being tired ard wearjfof 
 this fort of living, which made : them work for themfelves, 
 wiihout hopes of changing their condition, nothing would 
 ferve them, but that they wpuld make a voyage to the con- 
 tinent, and try if they e< uld feize upon fome pi the lavages, 
 2nd bring them over as flaves, to do their drudgery, while 
 they lived at eafe and pleafure.

 ** Indeed the projecT: was not fo prepoflerous, if they had 
 not gone farther; but they neither did, nor propofed any 
 rhinp, but what h?d mifchief in the defign, or the event.— 
 One'morning-, thefe three fellows came down to the limited 
 ftatiofi, and humbly defired o be admitted to talk with us 
 which we readily granted.; they told" us, in flion, that be- 
 ing tired of their manner of living, ard the labour of their 
 bands in fuch employ menu noc being fufRciem to procure 
 the necefld ies cf life, th/y only defired one of the canoes 
 we came over in, v\ ith lome arms and ammunition for their 
 defe-ce, 'and they would fetk their fortunes abroad, and 
 never trouble us any ito r "e. To be fure. we were glad 
 enough to get rid of fuch wretched plagues; but yet 
 honeily made us ingenuoull/ represent to them, by what 
 we ourfelves had fuftered, the certain deftruclicn they were 
 running into, either of being; itarved to death or murdered 
 by the favages. To this ihey very audacioufly replied, 
 that they neither could nor would work ; and consequently 
 that they might as well be ftarved abroad as at norne ; 
 and as to their falling ioto the hands of the favages, why, if 
 they were murdered, that was nothing to us, ihtre was an. 
 end of them.: neither had they any wives or children to cry 
 after them : nay, fo intent were they upon their voyage, that 
 if the Spaniards had noc given them arms, fo they had but 
 the canoe they would have gone without them. 
 
 i( Though we cou'd net well fpare our fire-arms, rather 
 than they fltc-utd go like naked men, we let them have two 
 rruOvtts, 2y piilol, a cutlafs, a^d three hatchets, which were 
 thought very fufficient ; we gave them alfo goat-' flelh, a 
 great- baiket full of dried grapes, a pot of ' freih butter, a 
 young live kid, and a large canoe' fufficient to carry twenty 
 men. And thus, with am a/r. made of a fSfVg pole, and a 
 fail of fci Urge goat-fkins dried, having a fair Orceze, and 
 flood-ade with them, they merrily failed away, the Spa- 
 niards calling tfflet them, Bon <vif)'tfjo,-i\Q man ever expecting 
 to fee them more. 
 
 4< When they were gone, the Spaniards and Engl ; fhmen 
 would often fay to ore another, ri O how peaceably do we 
 " now live, fence thofe turbulent fellows have left u- V — - 
 Nothing ccurd be farther from their thought: than to be \o\d 
 theif faces any more; and yet fcaree two and twen y days 
 had p^il-d over their heads, but or.e of the Ennl.fhmcn, be- 
 ing. abroad a planting? perceived, at a diltance, three men, 
 
 H 
 
 
 well armed, approaching towards him. Away he flies with 
 fpeed to our caftle, and tells me and the reft, that we were 
 all ur.dore, for that ftran^ers were landed upon the iHand, 
 and who they were he cculd net tell; but added, that ihey 
 were not favages, but men habited, hearing arms. Why 
 then, faid I, we have the lefs occafion to be concerned, 
 lince, if they were not Indians, they muft be friends ; for I 
 am fure there is no Chriftian people upon earth, but what 
 will do us good rather than harm. But while we were 
 corifiderittg of the event, up came the" three Englishmen, 
 whofe voices we quickly knew, and fo all our admiration 
 of that nature ceafed at once. And our wonder was fuc- 
 ceeded by another fort of inquiry, which was, what could 
 be the occafion of their returning fo quickly to the id and/ 
 when we little expected, and much lefs defired, their com- 
 pany ? but as this was better to be related by themfelves, 
 I ordered them to be brought in, when they gave me the 
 following relation of their voyage. 
 
 " After two days' fail, or fomething lefs, they reached 
 land, where they found the people coming to give them 
 another fort of reception than what they expert ed or di fi- 
 red ; for, as the favages were armed with bows and arrows, 
 they durfl not venture en fhore, but tfecred northwards, fix 
 or feven hours, till they gained an opening* by which they 
 plainly perceived, that the land that appeared from this 
 place, was not the main land, but an ifland. At their en- 
 trance into the opening of the fea, they discovered another 
 ifland on the right hand northward, and feveral more lying 
 to the weft ward ; but being refolved to go en more forne 
 where or other, they put aver to ore of the weftern iflands. 
 Here they found the natives vrry courteous to them, giving 
 them feveral roots and dried fifh ; nay, even their women 
 too were wMling to fupply them with what they could 
 procure them to eat, bringing it a great way to them upon 
 their heads. Among thofe h^fpitable Indians they con- 
 tinued fome days, inquiring, by figns and tokens, what na- 
 tions lay around them; and were informed, that there were 
 feveral fierce and terrib'e people lived every way, accuf- 
 tomed to eat mankind ; but fcr themfelves they neve,- ufed 
 fuch diet, except thofe that were taken in batt'e, and of 
 them they made a folemn feaft. 
 
 "The Englifhmen inquired how long it was fince they 
 had a feaft of that kind? Tney anfvvered, about two moons 
 
 
 ago, pointing to the moon ; and then two fingers ; that, 
 at tr is time, their king had tw > hundred prifoners, which 
 were -fastening up for the Oaughter. The EngHfhmm 
 «e r e mighty defirous of feei g the prifoners, which the 
 others mi/rakirg, thought that they waned fume of them 
 for their own food ; upon which they beckoned to them, 
 pointing to the riling, a,nd then ;o the fet-ing of the fun; 
 meaning, that by the time it appeared in the eaft next 
 morning, they would bring them fome; and indeed they 
 were as good as their word ; for by that time they brought 
 eleven men and five women, juft as (a many cows and 
 oxen are brought to fee-port t owns, to victual a fhfp. But 
 as brutifh as thefe EngMhmen were, their i'loroachs turned 
 at the fight. What to do in this cafe, they could net tell : 
 to refufe the priforers would hkve been :be -highefl affront 
 offered to the favage gentry ; and to difpofe of them, they 
 knew not in what manner; however they refolded to ac- 
 cept them, and fo gave them, in return, one of their 
 hatchets, an old key, a knife, and fix or -feven of their 
 bullets ; things wmch, though they were who! y ignorant of, 
 yet they feemed entirely contented with; snd dragging the 
 poor wretches into the boat with their hands bound behind 
 them, delivered them to the Englifhmen. But this obliged 
 them to put off as foon as they h d ihefe prtf.nts, left the 
 donors Hi uld have expected two or three of them to be 
 killed, ?nd to be invited to dinner <ke next day ; and fo 
 taking leave with all pohVole refpect and thinks, rhdugfc 
 neither of them underwood what the others faid, they faded 
 away back to the iirft uland, and there fee eight of the 
 prifoners at liberty. In ?he;r vo\age they endeavoured to 
 comfort, ard have fome cor.ve/fa ion with the poor cap- 
 tives 3 bur it was impcilib'e Co make them femfihle of any 
 thing; and nothing they could fay or give, or dv for them, 
 could make them otneiwife perfuaded, but that t'^ev Were 
 unbound only to be devoured : if they gave them tny 
 food, they thought it was only to fatten them for the 
 Slaughter; cr looked at any one mere p rticuiarly,- the 
 poor creature iupp: fed rfelf to be the firJi racfifice ; and 
 even when we brought fern to our vfbod, rnd be^n to 
 ufe them with the grea eft. humanity ard kirciiiefs vet th-y 
 expected < very day Chat their new mailers would devour 
 them. 
 
 ** And thus, Sir? 6]d ihefe three firarge wandeiers con- 
 
 U 2 
 
 
 elude their unaccountable relation of thir voyage, which 
 was both amazing and entertaining, Hereupon, I afked 
 them where their new family was ? They told me/ they had 
 put them into one of their huts, and they came tob?g fome 
 victuals for them. This, indeed, made us all long to fee 
 them; and taking Friday's father with us, leaving only two 
 at our caflle, we came down to behoTd thefe poor creatures. 
 
 .*' When we arrived' at the hut, (they being bound again 
 by the Engliihmtn, for fe^r of efcaping,) we fourd them 
 flark nakrd, expecting their fatal tragedy; they' were 
 three luiiy men, well fhaped, with fiaight and good limbs, 
 between thfrty and live and thirty years eld » and five wo- 
 men, two of them might be from thirty to fort), two more 
 not above four and twenty; and the laft, a comely tall 
 maiden of about feventeert. Indeed, all the women were 
 very agreeable, both in proportion and features, except 
 that they were tawny, which their model! behaviour, and 
 other graces, m^de amends fur, when they afterwards 
 iame to be dothed. 
 
 '* This naked appearance, together with t^eir miferable 
 circurailancts, was no very comfortable fight to my Spa- 
 niards, who, for their, parts, I may venture, Sir, without 
 flattery, to fay, are men of the bed behaviour, calmed 
 tempers, and fweeteft nature, that c?n pufhbiy be; for 
 they immediately ordered Friday's father to fee if hejtnew 
 any of them, or if he underftodd what they could fay. 
 No foor.er did the o!d\ Indian appear, but he looked at 
 them with great ferioufnefs; yet as they were not of his 
 nation* they were u ter Grangers to him, and none could 
 underhand his  fpeech or figns, but ore woman. This was 
 enough to anfwer his defign, which was to aflute them 
 they would not be killed, being faUen into the ra-ds of 
 Chriftiarrf, who abhoired fuch barbarity. When they 
 were fully (aiisfied of ths, they expreffed their joy by fuch 
 ilrange gefturrs, and uncommon tones, as it is not pofiible . 
 for me to defcribe. But the woman, their interpreter, was 
 ordered next to inquire, whether they were content to be 
 fervants, and would, work for the men who had br: tight 
 them ".hither to fave their lives ? Hereupon, (being at this 
 time unbound,) they fell a capering and dancing, one taking 
 this thing upon her moulders, and the others t r at, intima. 
 ting, that they were wiliingvto do any thing for them. But 
 ,navv, Sir, k&viug women among ft us, and dreading tha.t 
 
 
 it m'ght occafion fome ftrife, if not blood, I afked the three 
 men what they would do, and how they intended to ufe 
 thefe creatures, whether as fervants or women ? One of them 
 very pertly and leadily anfwered, they would ufe them as 
 both. Gentle nen, iaid I, as you are your o -n maftersj I 
 am nut goine to reilrain you from that ; but, nWthinks, for 
 avoiding diifcrifions among you, I would only defire you to 
 engage, that none of you will take more than one for a wo- 
 man or wife, a^d that having taken this one, none eife fhould 
 pre fame to touch her; for though we have net a pried ly 
 authority to marry v'ou, yet it is but rea finable, chat who- 
 ever thus takes a woman, ftVuld be obliged to maintain her, 
 fince nobody has any thing to do witn her ; an*! this, in* 
 deed, appeared To jirft to all prefent* that it was unanimoufly 
 agreed to. The Engl'ifhmen then afked my Spaniards, whe- 
 ther they dtftgo&d to take any of them? but they all an- 
 fwered, No; lome declaring they had already wives in 
 Spain ; and others, that they cared not to jorn'with infidels. 
 On the reverfe, the Erighfhmen took each of them a tem- 
 porary wife, and f> fet up a new.mefbod 'of living, As to 
 Friday's father, the Spiniar s, and the three favage fervkhts 
 we" had taken in the fate battle, they all lived with me in 
 our ancient caft'e ; and indeed we fupplied the main part 
 of the ifland with food, as neceflity required. B«t the mc ft 
 rem ukable part of the fiery is, how thefe Englishmen, who- 
 had been fo much at, variance, mould agree about the chece 
 of thofe women ! yet they took a way good enough to pre- 
 vent quarrelling among themfeives. They fee the Hve wo~ 
 men in one of their hues, and going therofclves to the other, 
 crew lots which mould have the hrft choice. Nciw, he 
 that had the hrft lot went to the hut, arid fetched out her 
 he chofe; and it is remarkable, that he took her that was 
 the moii homely and elded of the number, which made ths 
 reft of ihe Englifhmcn "exceedingly merry; the Spaniards 
 Ihemftlves could not but fmile at it ; but, as it happened, 
 the fellow had the bell thought, in choonng one fn for ap- 
 plication, and bufinefs ; and, indeed, me proved the belt 
 wife of all the parcel. 
 
 But when the poor creatures perceived themfelves placed 
 in a row, and ft parated one by one, they were again feized 
 with an urifpeakable terror, asn.w thi? king they were going 
 to. be (lain io earneil ; arid when the Englimmen came to 
 lake the firit, ths reft fet up a-lamemabie cry, clafped their 
 
 113 
 
 
 arms round, r-er neck, and. bangirg about her, took their 
 Jaff farewell, as the) thought, in fuch trembling agonies, 
 and affectionate embraces, as would have fastened thr hard- 
 eJl heart in the world, and made (he dficf! eyes melt into 
 clears ; nor could they be perfuaded but Inn they were going 
 to die, till fuch time as Friday's father made them fe. tible 
 that the Englishmen had c ho fen them for their wives, which 
 ended all their terror and concern upon this occafion. 
 
 *f Well, after this, the Englishmen w^nt to work, and, be- 
 ing affiled by my good-natured Spaniards, in a few hours 
 they eiecled every one of ihem a new hut or tent Tor their 
 separate lodging, iince thofe ihey had already were rilled 
 wnh to Is, hcufehold fluff, and provifion. Trey all ccn- 
 tinned on the north more cf the i flared, but feparare as be- 
 f© e; tjie three wicked ore- pitched farther off, and the two 
 honeft men nearer our cattle ; fo thdt the ifland fcemed to 
 be peopled in tbr.e places, three towns beginning to be built 
 for that purpofe. And here 1 cannot but remark* what is 
 \ery common, that the two bom ft men had the worft wive*, 
 (I mean as >o induilry, ejeanli e.fc, and ingenuity,) while the 
 three reprobates enjoyed women of contrary qualities. 
 
 4 * But another observation I made was, in favour of .the 
 two honeff men, to (how what difparny there is between a 
 diligent application to buunefs, on the one hand, and a floth- 
 fuj, negligent, and idte temper,- on <he o?her. Both of 
 them had the fame parcel of ground hid our, and con to 
 fow ftfnlx.ient for them ; bat both did not mke tie fame 
 improvements ehher in their cu.ltiva.ion or jjheif planting, 
 "The two hone*'! men had a multitude of young trees planed 
 tbout their habratiors, fo that when you approached near 
 (hern, nothing appeared but a wood, vety pirating and de- 
 I'ghtful. Ever/ thing they oid profpered a d fbunmedj 
 their graces planted in order, feemed as t.ough managed in 
 a vineyar-i,and were if finitely preferable to any of the others. 
 Nor we're they wanting to fin y out a place of retreat, but 
 c'ug a rave in u\t moil retired part of a thick wood, to Fe- 
 cu-re their wives and cnil re*, wi'.h their proviiion and chief- 
 eft goods, furrounded with i numerable. ftake>, and having 
 a moft fubtle entrance, in cafe a* y mifchief fhould happen, 
 either from their feilow countrymen,, or thede vouring lavages, 
 
 4 « As to tie rVp/obate?, (th ugh I mu:i o-vn they were 
 much more civilized than before,) inffead of a delightful wood 
 furroundirg their cfwellt gs, we found the words of King 
 
 
 Solomon too truly verified ; " I went by t u x vineyard of the 
 M flothfu!, and it was a'l overgrown with thorns." In many 
 places their crop was obfcureci by weeds ; the bedges having 
 feversl gaps in them, the w ; ld goa:s had goc in, and eateri 
 up the com, and here and there was a dead bufh to flop 
 thefe gaps for the prefent, which was no more than (hutting 
 the liable door after the fteed was flo'eo. away. But as to 
 their wives, they (as I obferved before) were more diligent, 
 and clemly enough, tfpecially in their victuals, being in- 
 ftructed by one oi the honeft men, who bad been a cook's 
 mate on b ard a (hip: and very well it was io ; for as he 
 cooked himfeif, his companion and tneir families lived as 
 well .as the idle huib-nds, who did nothing but joker about, 
 fetch turt'es' eggs, eaten fifti and birds, and do any thing but 
 work, and lived accordingly; while the diligenc lived very 
 handfomely and plentifully, in the moft comfortable manner* 
 " And now, Sir, I come to lay before your eyes a fcene 
 quite different from any thing that ever Happened to us be- 
 fore, and perhaps ever befel you in aii the time of your 
 residence on this ifland. I ihali inform you of it Sk original 
 in the foil jwing manner: 
 
 '-«' One morning, Sir, very early, there came five or fix 
 ca -ces of Indians on fhore, indifputably upon their old cuf- 
 tom of devouring their prifoners. All that we had to do 
 upon fuch an oecafion, was to lie conceal? d, that they, not 
 having any notice of inhabitants, might depart quietly, a-fter 
 performing their bloody execution : whoever firil d'feovered 
 the favages, was to give notice to all the three plantations 
 to keep within doors, and then a proper fecut was to be 
 placed to give intelligence of their departure. But, not- 
 with (landing thefe wile meafures, an unhappy difafter dtf- 
 covered us to the favages, which was like to have caufed 
 the defoltion of the wrole ifland; for, after the favages 
 were gone off in their canoes, fome of my Spaniards and I 
 looking abroad, and being inflamed with a curiolity to fee 
 what they had been doing, to our great amazement beheld 
 three favages tfaft afieep on the ground, who, ei her bji g 
 gorged, could rot awake when the others went off, or havirg 
 wandered too far into the woods, did not c mc bactc in time. 
 
 M What to do with them at firft, we could nt tell ; as for 
 flaves we had enough of them already; ard as to killing 
 them, neither Chhllianity nor humanity would fuhvr us to 
 
 H I 
 
 
 fhed the blood of perfons who never did us wrong. We 
 perceived they had no boat left them to tranfport them to 
 their own ration; and that, by letting tlum wander about, 
 they might difcover us, and inform the ruli fava r ;es that 
 fhculd happen to land.upon the fame bloody occasion, which 
 information might entirely ruin us: and therefore I coun- 
 ielled my Spaniards to fecure them, and fee them about fome 
 work or other, till we eou'd better difpofe of them. 
 
 " Hereupon we ail went back, snd making them awake, 
 to.-,k them prifoners. Jt is impoffible to exprefs the horror 
 'they were in, efpecially when bound, as thinking they were 
 going to be murdered and eaten, but we foon eafed them of 
 their fear as to that p int. We firit took them to the bower, 
 where the chief of our country work lay, as keeping goats, 
 planting corn, &e. and then carried them -to the two £ng- 
 1'fhmen's habitation, to help them in their bu ft ns fs ; but 
 happy it was for us all we did not carry them to our caftle, 
 as oy the fequel will appear. The Englishmen, indeed, 
 found therh work to d^ ; hut whether they did not 'guard 
 tnem ltrictiy, or that they thought they could not better them- 
 felws, I cannot teil ; but certainly one of them ran away into 
 the woods, and they couidnothe^rof him f:r along time after. 
 
 44 -'Undoub'edly there was reaion enough tofuppofe he got 
 home in fome of the canoes, the lavages returning m ;xbout 
 four weeks time, and. going off in ihe fpaceof two d$ys. 
 Yuq may be certain, Sir, this thought could not bot terrify 
 its- exceedingly, and make u . juitly conclude, that the favage 
 . wt. u!d inform his countrymen of out abode in «he iiland, 
 how few and weak we were in comprifon to their numbers; 
 ?;nd we expected k weu'd not be long before the Englifh- 
 men would be attacked in their habitations : but the iavages 
 hzd not feen their places of fafety in ;.he woods, nor our 
 caflle, which it was a great happinefs they did not krow. 
 
 ,f N. r were we mitiaken in our thoughts upon ih-s oc- 
 ean* n ; for about ei^bt months after ths, i\x caroes, wiih 
 about ten men in each canoe, came failing by the north-iide 
 of the iflard, which th^y were never accuitorned to do before, 
 and lanced ah ut an hour after fun-rife, near a mile from the 
 dwelling of the two Englifhmen, who it feems, had the 
 grod fottu e to di-cover tnem about a league off: f o that it 
 was an hour before they could attain the more, and fome 
 time longer before they could come at them- And now 
 being cuoffrined if* this opinion that they v^ere certainly 
 
 
 betrayed, they immediately bound the two Haves which were 
 left, cauting two *f the three men, whom they brought with 
 the women, ancLwho proved very faithful, to lead them with 
 the r wives, and other conveniences, into the'rr retired cave 
 in the wood, snd there to bind the two fellows hand and 
 foot, till they had further orders. Thtn they opened their 
 fences, where they kept rheir milch goacs, and drove them 
 a!! out, giving the goals, liberty to ramble in the woods, to 
 make the fayages believe that they were wild ones; but the 
 ilave had g vert a truer information, which made them come 
 to the very enciofures. The two frightened men fent the 
 o-.her fhve of the three, who had been with them by acci- 
 dent, to alarm the Spaniards, and deilre their alMance; in 
 the -mean -timer, they took their arms and ammunition^ and 
 made Jo the cave where they had fent their wives, aod fe~ 
 curing their (laves, fealed themfelves in a private place, •' 
 from whence they might behold all the actions of the favages, 
 Ncr had they gone tar, wh^n f afcendinga rifing ground, 
 they could fe* a little army- of Indians approach to th^ir 
 beautiful duelling, and in a few moments more, perceive - 
 the fame, and their furniture, to their unfpeakable -grief,, 
 burnings in a confaming flame; and when this was done,,. 
 they fpread here and there, iearching ev^ry bum and places 
 for the people, cf wkm it was evident they had information, 
 Upon which the i*o Englimrhen, not thinking themfelves 
 fecure where they ftood, retreated about half a mile higher 
 into the country, righ:ly concluding, that the finher the 
 favages firolkd, there would belefs numbers together: upon 
 which they next took treir (land by the trunk of an old tree 
 very hollow and large, whercc they reibived to fee what ; 
 would oiler; but. they had net -flood long iherQ, before two 
 favages came running directly towards them, as though 
 .having knowledge o( their being ihere, who feerned revived 
 to afack them ; a little farther were three more, . and fivs 
 more behind them again, all running the fame way. It 
 cannot.be imagined the perplexity the poor men w«re in at 
 jhis -fight, thinking that if dMance did not Tpeedily come, 
 their cave in the wocd would be difcovcrcd, andconfe.cjaently 
 all therein loll ; io they rr folded to re lift them tr.er^, and, 
 when overpowered, to afcend to the top of the trees, where 
 they might defend themfelves as long as their ammunition.- 
 l&ited, and fell their- lives as dsas as poflibie to tiioiW

 devouring favages. Thus fixed in t^eir resolution, they 
 next confidcred, whether they fnould fire at the firft two, or 
 wait, for the three, and fo take the middle party, by which 
 the two firft and the five lafi would be Separated. In this 
 regulation the two favages alfo confirmed them, by tuning 
 a little to another part of the woctd ; but the three, and the 
 five after them, came direclly towards the tree. Hereupon 
 they refolved to take them in a direct line, as they approach* 
 ed nearer, becaufe, perhaps, the firft Ibot might hit them aU 
 three; and upon this occasion, the man who was to fire, 
 charged his piece with three or four bullets. And thus 
 while they were waiting the favages came on ; one of them 
 was the runaway * who had caufed ail the mifehief: fo they 
 refolved. he mould not efcape, if they both fired at once* 
 But, however, though they d cVnot fire together, they were 
 ready charged; when the firft that let fly was to good a 
 Biarkfman to rnifs- his aim, for he killed the foremoft out- 
 right, the fecond (who was the runaway Indian) ftli to the 
 ground, being f li t through the body, bai not dead, and the 
 third was- a little wounded in tie fhoulder, who, fitting 1 
 down on the ground,, fel-f a_fcr earning in a uiall fearful man- 
 »er. The ncife cf the guns, which not only mide the moll 
 refpunding echoes, f r m one fide to the other, but raifed 
 . the birds of all fort;-, fluttering with the moft confufed noife, 
 fo much terrified the five fa^vages behind, that they flood 
 full at .firft, like fo -many inanimate images. Di>t when all 
 things were in profound illence, they came to the place wh?re 
 their companions lay ; and here, not being feniible that 
 they were liable to the fame fate, ftocd aver "the wounded 
 2man,u^doubrcdlv inquiring the oceaflon of this calamity ; 
 and 'tis as readable 16 fupj^fe, he told them, that it came 
 by thunder gnci lightning f *:-m tire gods, .having never fee-** 
 or heard of a.gu-n be '"are, in the whole courfe el their lives., 
 By this time the Engjiihnven, having laded their pieces, 
 fired both fcogetfier a fecond tirpe, when 'feeirg them all fail 
 immediately on the ground, they thought they Had killed 
 every creature of them. This made them con « -»p boldly 
 Before they had charged their guns, which, indeed^ was a 
 wrong fterJ ; for. when -they came to the placf,. ».fafey found- 
 four alive, tw«6f tbecri vtry little wounded, and one r.ot at 
 all, which obliged i>c:m to fall upon ihem wkh their, rcufkets ; 
 they ttxil. lv socked the Runaway favage on the head, and 
 a&Qlher tha; *«is but little *CKrd.ed in. she arrr^ and tkeJK 
 
 
 put the other Janguifhing wretches out of their pain ; while 
 he that was not hurt, with bended knees End uplift hands, 
 made piteous moans and figns.'to them to fpare his life ; 
 nor, indeed, were they unmerciful to the poor wretch, but 
 pointed to him to fit down at the root of a tree hard by; and 
 then o e of the Erg'iilimen, with 'a piece of rope-twine he 
 had in his pocket b/ mere chance, tying his feet faft to* 
 ^ether and his two ^hands behind him, they left him there, 
 making all the hafte they could after the other two, fearing 
 they ihould find out their cave ; but though 'hey could not 
 cvenake them, they had the faiisfaiftion to perceive thera 
 at a dtttance crofs a valley towards the fea, a quite con- 
 trary way to their retreat ; up@n which they returned to the? 
 tree, to look after their prifoner ; but when they canie there 
 he was gone, leaving the piece of rope-yarn, wherewith he 
 was bound, behind him, 
 
 ic 'Well, now they were as much concerned as ever, as '* 
 not" knowing bow near their enemies might be, or in what 
 numbers. Immediately they repaired to the cave, td fee if 
 a<l was well there, and found every thing fafe, except the 
 women who were frightened upon their huflxrnds* account^ 
 whom they now loved entirely; They had not been long 
 here, before Oven of my Spaniards came to afifft them; 
 while the other ten, their fervants, anJ Friday's father, were 
 gone to defend their bower, oorn, and cattle, in cafe the 
 fav? : ges fhould have rambled fo far. There accompanied 
 the feven Spaniards, one of the three favages that had for- 
 merly been taken prifoner ; and with them alfo that very. 
 Indian whom .the. Englishmen bad, a little before, left under' 
 the tree ; for, it fee.ms, they patted by that way where the 
 fliughter was m<idz, and fo carried along wkiv them th^t 
 poor wretch that .was left bound. But fo many prifbrers 
 now becoming a burden to us, and fearing the dreadful 
 cmfequence of their, efcaping, -mort of -the Spaniards and * 
 Eng.liih urged the abfol-ute-. neceiilly there was of kiHing . 
 them for our common preferv-atio-n •; but. Sir, the authority 
 I bore, as governor, over-ruled that p:ece of cruelty ; and • 
 then I ord red them to be lent prifoners to the Old cave- in 
 the vajley, bound hands and feet,.' with- two Spaniards to 
 guard- them;. 
 
 * 4 So much encouraged were the Er- glimmer at the sp& ? 
 proach of the Spamaichi, and fo great were their fury agairUfc 
 tae lavages for deitroying their habitations, tb.t they had , 
 
 
 r\oi patience to flay any longer ; but, taking five Spaniards 
 along with them, armed wish four mufkets,- a piftol, and a 
 charter iiafF, away they went in" purfuit of their enemies. 
 As they paffed by the plac<? where the favages wee flain, 
 it was very eafy to be perceived t u ar more of them h^d- 
 been there, having attempted tc carry ofF their dead bodies, 
 but found it impracticable. FroVn a rifing ground, our party 
 had the mortification to fee the fcr oke that proceeded from 
 the ruins; when, coming farther in iight of the fhore, ihey 
 plainly perceived that the favages had embarked in their 
 canoes, and were putting out to fea. This they were very 
 forry for, there beirjg no co<nio£ at them to give them a 
 parting falote ; but, however, they were glad enough to get 
 clear of fuch unwelcome guefts. 
 
 " Thus the two honeft, but unfortunate Engl' fh men, being 
 ruined a fecond time, 'and their 'improvements quite deft-roved, 
 mod of My good uatured Spaniards helped them to rebuild, 
 and we all aftifted'them with needful fupplies ; nay, what is 
 more remarkable their thrfee mifehi.evous countrymen, when 
 they heard of it, (which was after all thefe difaflers wereover^ 
 they living ni;re remoteeaftward,) very friendly fympathized 
 with them,", and worked for them leveral days; fo that in a 
 Jir.le their habitations were rebuiU, their neceHiies fuppliedj. 
 and themfeives reftored to their former tranquillity. 
 
 " Though the favages had nothing to b aft of in this ad- 
 venture, (feveral canoes being driven afhore, followed by 
 two drotvned creatures, having undoubtedly met with a 
 fiat-mac lea, that very night they departed,) yet it was natural 
 to be fuppcftd, that thofe whofe better fortune it was ta 
 attain tbt ir native ihore> would inflame their nation ta 
 another ruincus attempt, with a greater force, to carryall 
 btfjre them. And, indeed, fo it happened t for about fevea 
 months after, our ifland was invaded with a moil formidable 
 B£V7, no Izfa than eight an 1 twenty canoes full of favages^. 
 arm d with wooden fw< -rds, monllrous clubs, bows and 
 arrowc, and fuch hke foftruments of war, landing at the eafi 
 
 , end of the ifland. 
 
 "You may -well, Sir, imagine, what confternatio-n our 
 men were in- upon- this account, and how fpeedy they were 
 
 ' to execute their refolution, having only that nights time 
 allowed them. They knew xh^z fince they could not with- 
 fetid their enemies, concealment was the only way to pro- 
 eure tftelt JafetJ j and, therefore,, they took dewa th« huts 
 
 
 that were built for the two Englifhmen, and drove their 
 flock of goats, together with their own at the bower, to the 
 old cave in the valley, leaving as little appear -wee of in- 
 habitants as pofhb'e ; and ihen ported thefnfelves, with all 
 their force, at the plantation of ihe two men. As they ex- 
 pected fo it happened ; for ear'y the next morning, the 
 Indians, leaving their canoes at the eaft-end of the iflanJ, 
 came running along the (bore, about two hundred and irfcy 
 in Mimber, as near as could be gu fie j. Oar army was bat 
 little indeed ; and what was our greateft. misfortune, we had 
 not armsTufficient for them. The account, as to the mtn. 
 Sir, is as follows : viz. i7 Spaniards, 5 Erglifhrnen, old Fri- 
 day, the three favages, taken with the five women, who 
 proved faithful fervants, and thr£e other flaves, living with 
 the Spaniards. To arm thefe, they h*d 11 mufkets, 5 pif- 
 tols, 3 fowling-pieces, 2 fwords, 3 old halberts, 5 mufkets, 
 or fowling- piect?, taken from the failors whom you reduced, 
 As to the ilaves, we gave three of them halberts, and the 
 other, three long ilaves, with ureat iron fpikes at the end 
 of them, with hatchets by their fides ; we alfo hsd hatcne's 
 nicking in our girdles, befides the fire arms ; nay, two of 
 the u omen, infpired with Amrzonian fortitude, could not 
 be diffused fom fighting along with their dear huibands> 
 and if they died, to die wiihthem. Seeing their refolurion, 
 wegavs'them hatchets likewife; but what pleafed them 
 bed, were the bows and arrows (which they dexterouily 
 knew how to ufe) that the Indians had left behind tnem ? 
 af.er their memorable battle one againft another. 
 
 ** Over this army, which, though little, was of great in- 
 trepidity, I was conftituted chief general arid commander;, 
 and know ns: Will Atkins, though exceedingly wicked, yet 
 •a man of invincible courage, I gave him the power of com- 
 mar ding under me ; he had fix' men with tber mufkeis 
 loaded wi h fix or (even bulle s a piece, and were planted 
 juii behind a fmall thicket of bullies, as an advanced guards 
 having orders to let the firii by ; and then, when he 
 fired int;-! the middle of them, make a nimble retreat lound 
 a part of the wo d, and fo come in the rear of the Spiniards, 
 who were (had: d by a thicket of trees : for, though the fa- 
 vages c>me qa with the fiercenefs of lions, yet they wanted 
 the fubtlety of fuxes, being out of al manner of order, and 
 (iraggling in heaps every way ; and, indeed, when Will 
 Atkins, after fifty of the fivages had palled by, had ordered 
 
 
 three of his men to give fire, fo great was their conflenra* 
 tion, to fee fo many men killed and wounded,, and near fuca 
 a dreadful » oife, and yet knew not whence it came, that 
 they were frightened to the higheft degree; and when the 
 fccond volley was given, they concluded no lefs but that 
 their companions were flhin by thunder and lightning from 
 Heaven. In this notion they would have continued, had 
 Will A i kins and his men retired, as foon as they had fired, 
 according to order; or had the reft been near -them to pour 
 in their' /hot continually, theie might have been a complete 
 victory obtained; but flay £ g to load their pieces again, 
 difcovered the whole matter. They were perceived by 
 fome of the Scattering favages at a diftance, who let fly their 
 arrows among them, winded Atkins h'mfelf, and killed, his 
 fellow Eh ; liftman, and one of the Indians taken wi;h the 
 women. Our party did not fail to anfwer them, and in their 
 retreat killed about twenty favages. Here I cannot bat 
 take notice of cur poor dying Have, who though.ftopt from 
 h s retreit by a fatal arrow, yet with hi3 ftafT and hatchet 
 defperately and gallantly aiTailed his purfuers, and killed 
 five of the favages before his life fabmitted to a multiplicity 
 cf wounds. Nor is the cruelty or malice of the Indians to 
 be lefs remarked, in breaking the aims, legs, and heads of 
 the two dead bodies, with their clubs and wooden (words, 
 after a rnoft wretched manner. As Atkins retreated our 
 party adva-cfd; to feterpofe between him and the fava;.es : 
 but, after three volley s* we were obiiged to retreat alio ; for 
 they were fo numerous and clefperue, that they came up ta 
 our very teeth, fhot their arrows like a cloud, and their 
 wounded men, enraged with cruel pain* ..fought like mad men. 
 They did not, however, think fii to follow us, but drawing, 
 themfelvesup in a circle, they g^ve two triumphant fhouts in 
 token' of victory, though they hid the grief to (eefcveralof 
 their wounded men ble ; id to death before thera. 
 
 u After I had, Sir, drawn up my. little army together upon 
 a rifmg ground,. Atkins, wounded as he was, would frave 
 had us a: tack the whole body of .the favages at once. I 
 was extremely well pleafed with the gariamry. of the man : 
 bin, up n confideraton, 1 replied, "You perceive, Seig- 
 " litor Atkins, how their wounded men fight, let them 
 " alono till morning, when ihpy will be f^int^ RiiT, and loe, 
 cc ano then we (hall have /ewer to combat with/' To 
 Wftick Atkins, fmiling* rcpli.;d 5 . ".That's, very uue>. Seig,- 
 
 
 " nior, (j fnall I too; and that's the reafon I would fight 
 ¥ them now I am warm." We all a? fwered, Seignior 
 Atkins, for your part you have behaved very gallantly ; and 
 if you are not able to approach the enemy in the morning, 
 we will fight for you, till then we thT k it convenient to-, 
 wait, and fo we tarred. 
 
 U By the brightness of the moon that night,, we perceived 
 the favages in great diforder about their dead and wounded 
 men. This made us changeour fefolution, and refoive o 
 fall upon them in the night, if we could give them one vol- 
 Jey undifcovered. This we had a fair opportunity to do, 
 by one of the two Englishmen leading us round, between 
 the woods and the fea-fide weftward, and turning fhort 
 fouth, came privately to a place where the thickeil of them 
 were. Unheard and unperceived, eight of us'fired among 
 them, and did dreadful execution "; and in half a minute 
 after, eight more of us let fly, killing and wounding abund- 
 ance of them ; and then dividing ourfelves into three bodies,, 
 eight perfons in each body, we mar'ched from among the 
 tr.ees, to the very teeth of the .enemy, fending forth the 
 greateft fhouts and acclamation*. ,- The fayages -hearing a 
 different ncife from three quarters at once, ftocrd in the 
 mm ii confufion ; but coming in fight oPfts, let fly a volley 
 of arrows^ which wounded poof old Friday, yet happily it 
 did not prove mortal. We did not, however/ give them a 
 fecond. opportunity ; but ruining in among them, we fired 
 three feveral ways,, and then fell to work with our f words* - 
 iteves, hatchets, and the butt-end of our mufkets, with a 
 fury not to be re-fifted \ fo that, with the moftdifmal fcream- 
 ing and howMng, they had recourfe to their feet, to fave their 
 lives by a fpeedy flight. Nor mull we forget the valour of" 
 the two women; for they expoled themfelves to the greateil 
 dangeis, killed many with their arrows, and valiantly de- 
 stroyed feveral more with their hatchets. 
 
 " Infighting thefe two battles, we were fo much tired* 
 that we di.i not then trouble ourfelves to purine- them ia 
 their canoes, in which we thought the-y would prefently 
 put to the ocean ; but there happenirg a dreadful ilorni at 
 ka, which continuing all that night, itnotcnJ-y prevented tneir 
 voyage, but daihed feveral of their beats to pieces againffc 
 the beach, and drove the red fo high upon the foore, that it. 
 jequired infinite labour to get them oil. After our men had; 
 ukea fome refreihmeat and a little repofe, they reiolvcd 
 
 
 early in the morning to go towards the place of their land- 
 ing, and fee whether they were gone off, or in what pofture 
 they remained. This neceftarily led them to the place of 
 battle, where feveral of the favages were expiring, a light 
 no way plcafing to generous minds, to delight in mife-ry, 
 though obliged to conquer them by the law -of arms ; ,but 
 oar own Indian Oaves put them out of their pain, by de- 
 fpafching them with their hatchets. At length coming m 
 
 - view of the remainder of the army, we fo nd them leading 
 upon their knees, which were bended toward their moaib, 
 and the head between the two hands. Hereupon, coming 
 within mufket-fhot of them, J ordered two pieces to be fired 
 without ball, in order to alarm them, that we might plainly 
 know, whether they had the courage to venture another battle,, 
 or were utterly difpiri ted from fuch an attempt, that To we 
 might accordingly manage them. And, indeed, the project 
 took very well ; for, no Teener did the fayages hear the fir ft 
 pun, and perceive the Main of the fecond but they fuddenly 
 iiarted upon their htt^ in the greater! coniternation ; and 
 when we approached towards' them, they ran howling and 
 fcreaming away up the hill into the country. 
 
 " We could rati er, at fir ft, have wifhed that the weather 
 had permitted th^rn tq have gone off to the fea ; but when 
 we consider that their efcape might becafion the approach 
 of multitudes, to our utter ruin and deflation, we were 
 very well plea fed the contrary happened: Will Atkins 
 (who, though wounded, would not part from us all th : s whi.'e) 
 
 -'" advifed us*not to let Hip this advantage, but clapping be- 
 tween them and their beats, deprive them of the capacity 
 of ever returning to plague the iiland : " I know," (aid he, 
 " there is btt one objection you can make, vvh'ch is, that 
 * ; thefe creatures living like beafts in the wood, may make 
 u excursions, rifle the plantations, and deftroy the tame 
 "goats-; but then, confider, we had better to do with an 
 " hundred men, whom we can kill, or mak« flnves of at 
 " leisure, than with an hundred nations, whom it is im- 
 " pofHbie we (hculd fave ourfelves, from, much lefs fab* 
 u die." This advice, -and t l 'e(s argument being approved 
 of, we fet fire to their boats ; and thc.ugh tkey were (o wet. 
 " that we could not burn them entirely, yet we made them 
 iricapable of fwimminp in the feas. As foon as the Indians 
 perceived what we were doing, many of them ran cut of the 
 woeds, in fight of us^ and kneel. ng dow»i,piteoufly cried out 
 
 
 Oa, Oa, Waramakoa. Intimating, 1 mppofe, that, if we would 
 bu. : (pare their cances, th*y would never trouble us ?^ain. 
 
 "But all their complaints, fnhrniffions, and enrrr ties, 
 were in vain; for fe!f-.refervatiov obliging us to the con- 
 trary, we deftroycd every one of them t at had e r cap d the 
 fury of the ocean. When the Indians perceived *his, they 
 raifed a lamentable cry, arc rtn into the woods, whr re hey 
 continued ranging about, making the woods ring. with taeir 
 lamentations. Here we ftipuld have confide ed, that making 
 thef'e creatures thus d fperate, we ought, at liu. fom^ vime, 
 to have fct a fuific.ent guard upon the pa tatians : for the 
 favagcs, in their ranging ab;ut, found out t e brwer, de- 
 ftroyed the fences, trode the corn do^nu^g- t ;ei feet, and 
 ' tore up the vines and graphs. It \s ne, we were alw-ys 
 able to fight thefe creatures ; bur as t e- were too f*;ft.for 
 us, and very nu erous, we d;rit noi .go out hagle, for fear 
 of them; though that too was needleis, tney having no 
 weapons, nor gny materials to make mem : and, indeed^ 
 their extremity appeared in a iittle tim: after. 
 
 . <f Thoueh the lavages, as already mentioned, had de- 
 ftroyed our b we;, and ail our corn, grp.'s, &c. yet we 
 had ftill left -_;ur dock of cattle m the vahey, by the cave, 
 wvh fome little corn Mat grew there, and the plantation of 
 Wili Atkins and his companions, one of whom being killed 
 by an arfuw, they vera now reduced to two : it is remark- 
 able trut this was ihe u\U,w who cut the poor Indian with 
 his hatchet, and had a defjgn to murder me and my coua] 
 irymen the 'Spani-Tcis.  As our condition was io low, we 
 came to the refelut o ; to cinve the favages up to the farther 
 part of the ifla- d, where no I dians landed; to kdl as many 
 of them as we could, til! we had reduced their number; and 
 thei to give the remainder iome corn to plant, and to teach 
 th.m how to live by their dairy labour. "Accordingly we 
 purfued ti.em with our guns, at the hearing of which ihey 
 were Co terrified, that taey vfrouid fj.1 lo the ground. — - 
 Every day we kiiied and wounded ierne of* tnem ; and man/ 
 were found ftarved to desth, fo that our hearts began to re- 
 lent at the fight of fuchrmferahie objects. But ai hut, with 
 great difficulty, tiking one of them alive, and uiing him 
 with kindr.eis and enderneis, we brougat him to old Fri- 
 day, who talked to him, and toid hi n now good we would 
 be to them all, giving them corn and land to plane arid live 
 in, and prefent noualhment, provided they ihould keep 
 
 
 within fuch bounds as fhou:d be allotted them, and not do 
 p ejudiee to oirers: " Go then," faid he, '* and i iform 
 • 4 yourc^ *ir,t vmc of his ; which, if they will not agree to» 
 •' every o e of them ftiall be flan." 
 
 * The poor cre^aru res, thoroughly humbled, being reduced 
 to about thirty (even, joyfully accepted the offer, and earn- 
 cftly be ged for food'; hereupon v\e fent twelve Spaniards 
 snd two Encpifhmen, well arm s d, together with old Friday, 
 and three Indian (laves were loaded with a large quantity 
 of bread and rice cakes, with three live goats ; and the 
 poor Indians being ordered to fit down on the fide of the 
 hill, they ale the victuals very thankfully, and have proved 
 faithful to the laft, .never irefpafling beyond their bounds, 
 where at this day they quietly and happily remain, arid 
 where we now knd then \){it them. They are co fined to 
 a neck of land about a mile and a half broad, and time or 
 four in length, on the fontb-eaft corner, of the ifland, the 
 fea being before, and lofty rncur.tairis behind them, free 
 from the appearance of canoes ; and indeed their country- 
 men never made any inquiry after them. We gave them 
 twelve hatchets, and three or four knives; have taught 
 them to build huts, make woeden fpades, plant corn, m^ke 
 bread, breed tame goats and milk them, as likewife to make 
 wicker -work, in which, I mud ingenuoufly con fefs, they 
 infinitely outdo us. having rncle them fel ves fevcral pretty 
 necefTaries and fancies, as batkets, fieves, birdcages, and 
 cupboards as alfo ftools, beds, and couches, no lefs ufeful 
 than deliyhtrul ; and now they I've the moft inrocent and 
 woffsnfive crea-ures that ever were fubdued in the world, 
 wanting nothing but wives to make them a nation, 
 
 (i Thus, kind Sir. have I given you, according to my 
 ability, an impartial account of the various tranfaclions that 
 have happened in the nland iince your departure, to this- 
 day; and we have great- re^fon to acknowledge the kind 
 providence of Heaven in cur merciful deliverance. When. 
 you irfpect your little kingdom, ycu will find in it fome 
 Ititfe improvement, your flocks increafed, and your fubjecls 
 a gmenu-d, fo that from a defdate iiland, as this was before 
 your wonderful deliverance upon it, here is a vifible prof- 
 peCt of its becoming a populous and well gove md little 
 kingdom, to your immcrtaljame and glory.*'' 
 
 There is no doubt to fuppofe but that the preceding re- 
 lation of my faithful Spaniard was very agreeable,- and ne 
 
 
 Jefs furprifing to me, to the young pried, and to all who 
 heard it: no; were thefe people leVs pie- fed »iih thofe 
 neceflary utenfils that I brought the;n, tack as ue kuives, 
 fcifibrs, (pades, move's, and pick-axes, with which they now 
 adorned their habitations. 
 
 So mucn had they addicted themfelves to wicker-work, 
 prompted by the ingenuity of the Indians whoalFnled them, 
 that vvhenl viewed the Englishman's cotanie% they Teemed 
 at a diftance as tho gh they had lived like beejs in a .hive; 
 for 'Will Atkln?, who has now become a very nduiirious 
 and fober man, hid made himfelf a tent of baikec-work 
 round the outiide ; the walls were worked in as a biikei, 
 in panneis orflrong fquares of thirty-two in number, Hand- 
 ing about (even feet high: in the middle was another, not 
 above twenty-two paces round but much ftronger buut, 
 being of an octagonal form, a$d in the eight c rners ftood 
 eight fir.ong pods, r^und tha top of which he laid ftrong 
 pieces, pinned with wooden pin?, from which he r&ifed a 
 pyramid for the -roof, mighty pretty, I allure you, and joined 
 very well together with iron fpik?s, which he made him- 
 {^]f ; for he had made him a forge, with a pair of wooden 
 bellows and charcoal for his work, forming an anvil out cf 
 one of the iron crows, to work upon, and in this manner 
 would he make himfelf hooks, dapks, fpikes, b, is, and 
 hinges, After he had pitched the roof of his innermoft tent, 
 he made it \o firm between the rafters with balket-werk, 
 thatching that over again with rice-itraw, and over that a 
 large leaf of a tree, that his houfe was as dry as if it had 
 been tiled or .dated. The outer circuit was covered as a 
 lean-to, quite reunu this inner apartment, laying long rafters 
 from the thirty-two angles to the top polls of tne inner 
 houfe, about twenty feet di!ia--ce, fo that there w r as afpace 
 iiks a wail between the outer and inner wail, near twenty 
 feet in breadth. The inner p-ace he parti t o.ed off with 
 ne fame wicker-work, dividing, it into (ix neat apartments, 
 every ore of which had a door, fir it into the entry of the 
 man itest, and another into the fpace and walk that was 
 round it, not only convenient for retreat, but for family ne- 
 ceiTaries. Within the door of the outer circle, there was a 
 paflige dtreclly ti the do r of the inner- houfe; on either 
 hde was a wicker partition, and a d^or, by which you got 
 into a room twen y-two feet wide, and about thi.-ty tottj, 
 
 
 and through that into another fa frailer length; fo that in 
 the outer circle were (en handfome rooms, fix of which 
 were only to be corn- at through the apartments of the in- 
 ner tent, fervb g as ret ring rooms to the refpective cham- 
 bers, of tile- in* er circle, and four large warehoufes, which 
 went in through one another, two on either hand of {he 
 pallage? chat led through the outer door to the inner tent.— ' 
 Infhorr, ndtbing could be built moreingenioufly, kept more 
 rteat, or have b t?er conveniences; and here lived the 
 three families, Will Atkins, his companions* their wives and 
 tbils ren, and the widow of the deceafed. As to religion/ 
 the men fold m taught their wives the knowledge of G d, 
 any more ihan the failors' cuilom of (Weajrincr by his name. 
 The grea •;* ft improvement their wives had, wa;% they 
 iau) hf them to fpeak Englifh, fo as to be underftcoi. 
 
 None of their children were then above fix years old ; 
 they were all fruitful enough, and I think the cook's mate's 
 ytife was big of her fixth child. 
 
 When 1 inquired of the Spaniards about their circum- 
 fiances while among the favages, they told me, that they 
 abandoned them-felves' to defpair, reckoning themselves a 
 pier and mWerabie people, that had no means put into their 
 hands, and consequently mull loon be ftarved to death.— 
 They owned, however, that they were in the wrong to^think 
 fo, and fr refuting the affittance that reafon oiflred for 
 their fupport* as well as future deliverance, con felting, that 
 gritf was a moil infjgnilicant paition, as it looked upon 
 thi'-gs as without remedy, and having po hope of things to 
 come °, all which verified this noted proverb, 
 
 In trouble to be troubled, 
 
 ia to have vcur trouble doubled. 
 
 Nor did thefe remarks end here J for, making obferva- 
 li^ns upon my improvement, and on my condition at firir, 
 infinitely worfe than their?, he told me thac En^lifhmeii " 
 had, in their diibefs, greater prefence of mind than thofe 
 ©f any cih^r country that he had met with; and that they 
 arul the Portuguefe were the worft men in the world to 
 ftrnggle undtr muf :r tunes.- When they landed among the 
 lavages, they feu d but linle provificn, exrept ihey would 
 turn cannibals, thee being but a few roots and herbs, with 
 little fubilarce in thcm> and of which the natives gave them 
 
 
 but very fparingly. Many were the ways they took to 
 civilize and teach the favages, but in vain ; for they would 
 not own them o be their intruders, whole lives were ow^ 
 ing to their bounty. Their extremities were very great, 
 being many days entirety without .food, the fivagea the e 
 being more indolent and lefs devouring than tnofe who 
 had betrer fjpplies. When they went out o battle, they 
 wer? obliged to aftift tnefe people, in cne of which my 
 f a it nf al Spaniard being take-*, had like to have been de- 
 voured. They had I oil their ammuniuo., which rendered 
 their tire-arms ufelefs : ror could t^ey u*e the bows and 
 arrows that were given them, fo thai while the armies were 
 at a 1 diftance they had no chance, but when clofe, ?*hen they 
 could be of fervice with hnlberts., and lharpened Hicks put 
 into the muzzles of their mulkets. They made themfelves 
 targets of wvod, covered with the fkins of wild beafts ; and 
 when one happened to be knocked down, the reft of the 
 company fought over him till he recovered : and then Hand- 
 ing e'ofe in a line, they would make their way through a 
 thoufand lavages. At the return of their friends who they 
 thought had been entombed in the bowels of their enemies, 
 their joy was inconceivable. Nor were they lefs iurpnfed 
 at the fight of the loaves of bread I had fene them, things, 
 that they had not ken for feveral years, at the famje time 
 colling and bleiling it, as though it was manna fent from 
 Heaven : but when they knew the errand, and perceived 
 the boat which was to carry them *o the perfon and place 
 from whence fuch relief came, this (truck them withfuch 
 a furprife of joy as made fome of them faint away, and 
 others bur ft out into tears. 
 
 This was the fummary account that I had from th^m. — . 
 I fhall now inform the reader what I next did for the.n,and 
 in what condition I left them. As we were all of opinion 
 that as the lavages woud fcarce trouble them anymore, fo 
 we had no apprehenfions on that fcore. I told them I was 
 come purely to eilabliih, and not to remove them ; and 
 upon that occaiion, had not only brought then n*c? 4T*ries 
 for convrnierce and defence, but alfo artificer, ad other 
 perfens both for their necefLry em ploy men is, nrid to add 
 to their tmmber. They were all together wheo I thus talked 
 to them and before I -delivered to them the ftores I brought, 
 1 afked them one by one 3 if they had entirely forgot the r 
 
 
 firft fcrHtrofit'es, would engage in the ft rictcft friendfhip, 
 and (hake hands with one another ? On this Will Atkins, 
 with abundance of ^ood humour, laid, they had afflictions 
 enough to make thern all fober, and enemies enough to 
 make them ail frie ds^ as for himfelf* he would live and 
 die among them, owning thru what the Spaniards had dote 
 to him, his own mad humour had made necefTary for them 
 to do. Nor had the Spaniards occafion to justify their pro- 
 ceedings to me : but they to!d me, that fince Will Atkins 
 had behaved himfelf fo valiantly in right, and at ether times 
 (ho^d fuch a regard to the common intereft of them all, 
 they had not only forgotten all that was 'pad, but thought 
 he ought as much to be -fruited with arms and neceffiries 
 as any cf them, which they teflified by making him next in 
 command to the governor: and they moil hranily embraced' 
 the occafion of giving me this folemn affurance, that they 
 would never feparate their intereii again jas long as they lived. 
 After thefe kind declarations of friendfhip, we appointed 
 all of us to dine together the next day ; upon this I caufed 
 the (hip's. cook and his mate to come on fhore for that pur- 
 pofe, to affiir. in drerTing' our dinner- We brought from 
 the (hip fix pieces of beef, and four of pork, together with 
 _ cur punch-bowl, and materials to' fill it ; and in particular I 
 gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten of Englifh 
 bter, which was very acceptable to them. The- Spaniards 
 added to our feait five whole kids, which being Toafud, 
 three of them were fent as freiii meat to the failors on board, 
 and the ocher two we ate ourfelves. After cur noerry and 
 innocent feail was over, I begsn to diftnbute my cargo 
 among them. Firlt, 1 gave them linen fufiicient to make 
 every one of them ft ur (hirts, and at the Spaniards' requeft 
 made them up fix. The thin Engl (h (luffs I allotted to 
 make every one a light coat like a frock, agreeable to the 
 climate, and left them fuch a quantity as to make more up n 
 their decay ; as alfo pumps, (hces, hats, and dockings It 
 is not to be expreffod the pleating fai is faction which i ,t 
 upon the countenances ©j thefe poor men, when they per- 
 ceived whatcare 1 took cf them, as if I nad been a common 
 father to them all ; and they ail engaged never to leave the 
 iitand, till I gave my content for their departure. 1 then 
 prefented to them the people I brought, viz, the tailor, 
 frr it h, and the two carpenters ; but my Jack-of-al!-Traces 
 was the molt acceptable piefent I could make them. My 
 
 
 tailor fell immediately to work, and made every one of them 
 a (hire; a£er which, ht learned the women hov* to fe.v'a ,d 
 flitch, thereby to become the more helpful to heir huibands. 
 Neither were the carpenters iefs ufekl, taking in pieces tueir 
 clumfy things; inibad of which they made coriyenjent and 
 hand fame tables, itools, bed Heads, cupbDai ds, lockers, and 
 fheives. But when I carried them to fee Will Atkins's 
 ba/ket-hov fe, they owned rhey never i^w fuch a piece of 
 natural ingenuity before : " I am fur?/' ftid one of the car- 
 penters, "the man that bolt t-is, has no ne^d of us ; you 
 " need, Sir, do nothing. but give hin tools." 
 
 1 d vided the to Is among them in this manner : to every 
 man- 1 gave a digging fp^de, a (hovel, and a rak *, as having 
 no harrows or piouchs; and ti every feparate place a pick- 
 axe, a crow, a broad a> e, and a faw, with a flore for a general 
 fupply, ihou'd any be broken or wpin o\i>. I left them alfo 
 nails, i!apre>, hinges, hammers, chiffels, knives, tcifibrs, and 
 ail forts of tools and iron work ; ai;d for the ufe of the 
 fmith, gave tbenv three tons of unwrought iron, fo> a (up- 
 plv ; ard as to arms and ammunition, 1 liored them even to 
 profusion; or, at leait, lo equip a Sufficient . little army 
 againil all oppofers whatfoever. - ^"^ 
 
 The young man (whofe mother was unfortunately flarved 
 to death) together witn the maid, a pious and wel-educated 
 young woman, feeing things fo well o dered otvfhore, (for 
 I made them accompany me,) and confijering they hid no 
 occasion to go [o far a voyage^as to he Eau-Ind.es, they 
 both defired of me, that I would leave them there, and 
 enter them among my fubjecls. This I readily agreed to, 
 order h)g them ?-. plat of ground, on which were tnree little 
 hoii.'es. erected, environed with bafket-wcrk, pallifadced 
 like Atkins's, and adjoining to his plantation. So contrived 
 were their tents, that each of them had a room apart to 
 lodge in, wh ile their middle tent was not oniy their ilore- 
 houfe, but their place for eating and drinking. At this 
 :iroe the two Englimrnen removed ;hrir habitation to thtir 
 r ormer place ; fo th t now t e ifland was divided into three 
 :o!or?ies: hrft, Thcfe I nave juft no* mentioned; fecendly, 
 That of Will Atkins, where there were four families of 
 inglifhmen, with their wives and children, the widow and 
 ;er children; the young man and the maid, who, by the 
 vay, we made a wife of before our departure ; three fa* 
 'ages, who were flavcs; the tailor, foiith, (who ferved alfo 
 
 
 as a gunfmith,) and my other celebrated perfon called Jack- 
 of-ali Trades : Thirdly, My chief colony, which confuted of 
 the Spaniards with old Friday, who Itill remained at my 
 old habitation, which was my capital city; and furely never 
 was there fuch a metropolis, it being now hid im (o obfcure 
 a grave, that a thoufand men might have ranged the ifland 
 a month, and looked purpofeiy for it, without btethg able to 
 find it, though the Spaniards had enlarged its boundaries, 
 both without and within, in a molt furprifmg manner. 
 
 Butnow I think it high timero fpeak of the young French 
 prieft, of the order of St. Benedict, whofejudiciousand pious 
 difcourfes, upon fundry occasions, merit an extraordinary 
 obfervati'n ; ncr can his being a French Papift prielr, I pre- 
 fume, give offence to a.y cf my readers, when they hive 
 this affurance from me, that he was a perfon of a mcft 
 courteous d if petition, exientive charity, and ex tited piety. 
 His arguments were always agreeable to reafon, and his 
 conversion the moft acceptable of any perfon th.it 1 had 
 €vii yet met with in my life.. 
 
 "Sir," faid he to me orie day, '* fince, u^def God/' 
 at the fame time trolling his breatr, " ybu have ndi only 
 4i faved my life; but by permitting me to go this voyage, 
 ** have granted me the 'happinefs of free converfaton, I 
 "think it my du*y, as my profeffion obliges me, to fave 
 44 what fouls I c^n, by bringing them to tne knowledge of 
 li fome catholic doctrine, neceifary to ' falvation : and fince 
 "thefe' people are dndej your i ivmeciate 'government, in 
 ** gratitude, juftice, and decency, for what you na*/e done 
 "for me, I iball r,ff>r no farther points in religion, than 
 " "what merit your approbation*" Being pleafed with the 
 ihodefiy of his carriage, 1 old him he fhould not be w'c-rfe 
 ufed for being of a different perluafion, if upon that very 
 account we did net differ in pints of faith, r,ot decert in 
 a' part of the country where the poor Indian's ought to be 
 .iftfrrucied in the knowledge of Bid true God, and his Son 
 Jefus Chrift. To this he iepljecF, that convention might 
 eaiily be feparated from deputes; that he would difcourfe. 
 with me rather as agentleman than on religion : but that, 
 if we did enter upon religious arguments, upon my defiririg 
 the fame, I would give him liberty to defend his own prin- 
 ciples. He farther added, that he would do all that became 
 him in his office, as a prieft as well *s a Chrift ian, jo pro- 
 care the happinefs cf all that were in the {hip : that though 
 
 
 
 he could nrt pray svi fe, ha wcm s d prjy for us on ?tt 6tca- 
 iions ; a>^ then be t> id me (everai excraerc'i^a?) ev^-its of 
 his life, within a few vesrs p.H; but partkua^y in this 
 tail, when was the meft remarkable: thai, in 'his voyage, 
 he he J ^;e.misiorune to be five times (hippe i . nd unfhipped : 
 his firft deilgn was to have g;.ne o Marttnico , for which 
 taki g (hip at St, Ma ; oe>, he was f reed • to L)tbbn by bad 
 weathtr, :he veliel running a-ground in the mouth f the 
 Tagus. that from theme he went on borird a Per uguefe 
 fliip, bou d to the Madeiras, whofe mailer b-ing but an in- 
 diffe ent nan er, ard out of his reckoning, they were drove 
 to Fial, where felling their com mdVit¥j whic-^ was corn, they 
 retcve d to ake in theif loadi. g at tftf Ifle of May, and to 
 fail tp Kewf upland , at the Banks of which, meeting a 
 French i"hip bound to. Quebec, in the river of Canada, and 
 from thence to Martinico, in this fhip he embarked ; the 
 matter of which dying at Quebec, that voyage was fuf- 
 pended; and lanly fhipped himfeif for France, this laft 
 fhip was deftrcy*rd by f A re, as before has been telaied. 
 
 At this time we talked no further ; but anoher morning 
 he comes to me, j u it as I was going to vifit :he Englifh- 
 men's colon), and tells me, tha: as he knew the proiperity 
 of the ijQand was my principal defire, he had fomeching to 
 communicate agreeable to my defigo, by which perhaps he 
 might put it, more than he yet thought it was, in rhe way 
 of the beredciion of Heaven. ." How, Sir !" faid I, in a 
 furprife, •« are we mt yeit in the way of Gcd's blerlings, 
 after all thefe fignal providences and deliverances, of which 
 you have had fucn an ample relation f" He r? piied, u I hope, 
 Sir, y u are in the w«y, and that yotr good defign will 
 prosper; but ft ill there «re fomc among you that are not 
 equally right in their actions; and rtmemher, 1 befeech 
 ycu, Sir, that Achan, by his crime, removed God's blefting 
 from the camp of the children or lfrael ; tnat thougr. dx 
 and thirty were entirely innocent, yet they became th- ob- 
 jects of Diyine vengeance, and bore the weight of his pui;;fh- 
 mert accordingly." 
 
 So ftnftbly was I touched with his difcourfe, and {a fa- 
 tisned with tha* ardent piety that inflamed his icul, that I 
 dtiired him to accompany me to the Englishmen's planta- 
 tions, which he was very glad of, by reafon they were the 
 fubjccl of what he defigned to difcourfe wuh me about : 
 and while we walked on together, he began in the follow- 
 ing manner : 
 t I 
 
 
 « ; SIr, (aid he, I muft confefs it as a grrat unhappmefs 
 thai- we < J ifagree in fevcral doctrinal articles of relgion ; bat 
 furcly both d us acknowledge this, that there is a God, 
 mm o havng given us fome flated. rules for our fervice *nd 
 vb dience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to oftf nd 
 hiro ; ' cithrr by neglecYKg wha, he has commanded, or by* 
 doing what he has (orhidde*. This truth every ChrifHan 
 owns, that wh ;; n any ne pref ;mptuouflv fins againft God's 
 .commani, he Almighty then withdraws his blefling from 
 him ; every go d man therefore ught certainly t prevent 
 fuch neglect of, or fin apai-nft, Gid and his commands [ 
 thanked the y ujig prieft for xprefiin? fo great a concern 
 for u«, and defired him to explain the pa^ icdars of what 
 he ''ad obferv d, th it a cording to the parable of Achan, I 
 *( might remove that accursed hing from among us.'* Why 
 then, Sir, faid he, in ihe fir/t pace, you have four Englifh- 
 ynen, who have taken favage women to th ir wives, by 
 whom th y have feveral children, though none of them are 
 Jegally married, as the law of God and man require ; they, 
 I fay, Sir, are no le'fs than adulterers, and as they flill live 
 in adu'tery, are liable to the curfe of God. I know, Sir, 
 you may object tne want of a prieft, -or clergyman of any 
 kind ; as alto, pep, ink, and paper, to write down a ccn- 
 tract of mmiage, and have it figned between them. But 
 neither this nor what the Spanifh governor has t Id you of 
 their choofing by confent, can be; reckoned a marriage, nor 
 any more thrrn an agreement to keep th^m from quarrelling 
 among themfelves : for. Sir the effence or facrament of 
 matrimony ((a he called ii) not only con/ills in'mutual con- 
 lent, but in the leg^l obligation which compels f-em to 
 own and acknowledge one another, to abftain from other 
 perfons, the men to provide for their w.ves and children, 
 and the women to the fame and like co ditions, mutatis mu- 
 tandis, on their fide: whereas, Sir, tele men, upon their 
 own pleasure, on anv cccafion, may forfake thofe women, 
 and marry others, and by drowning their children, fuffer 
 thrm utterly to perim." *• Now, Sir,*' added he, u can 
 God be honoured in fuch *n unlawful Lbertv as this f how 
 can a bh-flin^ fucce^d to the bell endeavours, if men are 
 allow* d to live in fo licentious a way r" I was indeed (truck 
 with the t ing myfelf, and thought that they were much to 
 blame, that no formal contract hid been made, though it 
 bad been but breaking * flick between them, to .engage 
 
of a on i n so n crusos. 195 
 
 them to live as and man wife, never to feparate, but love, 
 cherifh, and comfort one another ill their lives." u Yet, 
 Sir,' 1 faid I, " when they took thefe women, I was not here; 
 -and if it is adultery, it is pall my remedy, and I cannot i.elp 
 it." "True, Sir/" aofwered the yourg prieir, c< you can- 
 not be charged with that part of the cm e which was done 
 in your abfence : but I befeech you don't Hatter yourfelf, 
 that you are under no obligation now to put a period to it : 
 which if you neglect to do, the guilt will be entirely on you 
 alone, fince it is certainly in nobody's power but yours, to 
 alter their condition." I muft c nfefs, I was fo dull, that I 
 thought he meant I (h uid part them, and knowing that 
 this wo.'Jd per the whole ifland i toconfufi n, I told him I 
 could not content to it upon any account whatfoever. €i Sir/* 
 iaid hv, in great furp'ife, " I do not mean that you mould 
 feparate, but marry the*n, by a written contrac , figned by 
 both man and woman, a d by all the witneifes prefenf* 
 "which all the European laws decree to be of Sufficient ef* 
 -ficacy." Amazed with fuch true piety and fineerity. and 
 <cenfidering the validity-pf a written contract, I ack owledged 
 all that ne faid to be very jui! and -kind, an J thac I would 
 difcourie with the men about it j neither could. I fee what 
 reaion they could have not to let him marry them, whcfe 
 authority in that affair is owned to be as authentic as if they 
 were married bv any of cur clergy men in England. 
 
 The, next. -complaint he had to make to me was this, that 
 though thefe En« r li(h fubjects of mine have lived with thefe 
 women feven '.ears, and though they were of good under- 
 warding, ar.d capable of infraction, having /earned not 
 only to fpeak, but to read Erglift, yet all Uiis whili they 
 had never taught them any thing of the Cftfiftian religion, 
 or the knowledge of God, much lefs in what manner he 
 ought to be f rv.d And is n >t this an unaccun table 
 neglect:" faid he w rmy; «' Derend upon it, God Al- 
 mighty wil xall them to account for fuch contempt. And 
 though i am rot cf yocr reiigio.., ye. I fhoula be obd to 
 fee thefe peop e rel afed from th- Devi's power, and be 
 faveu by the p.inciples cf the Chr flian reiigio;., the know-

 I could held do longer, but embracing htm, told hirto, 
 with a thouf nd thanks, I would granc whatever he requeu- 
 ed, and dcared him to roceed i« the third ar;icle, which 
 he did in the following rr« an er : 
 
 * c S'r," faid he, " it (hpuld be a maxim among all Ch rift- 
 ians, thai Chrifti n knowledge ought to be propagated 
 by all roiliblq means, and on all >cc fions. U on this 
 accrurt our c nreh tends miflionaries into Perik, I: d«.j, and

 While he  *as thus fpeaking, I could c ifc^ver a rapture 
 in his face, by his colour gcirg and oomiflg ; at the fame 
 time his eyts i\ arkled like fire, and ail the fi^ns of the 
 moft zealous tranfpors. And when I afked whuher he 
 svss in earneft ? <c Sir/' faid. he, l * it was, to preach to ths 
 
 
 Indians I conferred to come along with you ; thefe infidels, 
 even in this littfe ifhnd, are infinitely of more worth t! an 
 mv poor life : if fo t at I mould prove t*re happy instrument 
 of laving thek poor creatu.eV foulr, 1 care no; if I never 
 fee my native Country again. One tiring 1 on'.y beg of you 
 more is, that you wculd leave Friday with me, to be my 
 interpre er, without whbfe 'affiftance' neither of us will 
 tf deft cd each other: 5 ' . m 
 
 This requeft very fen&bly troubled me : Hrft upon Fri- 
 day's being bed a Proteftant ; and, fee ;ndly 7 for the af- 
 fedi n I bore to him for his fidelity : But immediately the 
 remembrance or Friday's father coming into my head, I re- 
 commended him to him as having learned Spa;~im\ which 
 the pried alfo under ftpod : and  fo was thoroughly famfted; 
 
 tvilh him. """*'".. 
 
 • When w 5 - came to the EnpHmmen, after I had- told them 
 what neceffary thing's I had done for them, I talked to them 
 cf the icardalons life they led ; told them what notice the 
 clergyman had taken of it, and aOced t'rum if they were 
 married men or bachelors ? They anfwercd, two of them 
 were *vicLwers, and the other th^ee tingle men. But faid 
 Iv with what-confeience can you call thefe your wives, by 
 whem you have fo many children, and yet are not iawlyHy 
 married ? They all faid, that 'they took them before the 
 Governor, as fuch, having nobody elfe to marry them, which 
 they thought as legal, as if they had had a parfon. No 
 doubt, f-id I, but in the eye of Goi it is fo : but unlefs t 
 arrj affured of your h neft intent, never to deleft thefe poor 
 creaiur s I can do nothing more for you, neither can you 
 expect God's bh-ffi'i g while you live in fuch- an open courfe 
 of adultery. Hereupon Will Atkins, who fpoke for the reft, 
 told me, that they believed their wives the moll inn cent 
 #nd virtuous creatures in the world; that t ey woirld never 
 forf?-ke them while they had breata ; aira that, if there wa& 
 a ciert)man in the (hip, they wou'd b? married to tbetn 
 win all their hearts. I to 1 !! you before, faid I, dm I have 
 a m nifter with me, who mail marry yt u to-morrow morn- 
 ing, if you are willing ; fo I would have yon confult to- 
 night with the reft about it. I to.d him the clergyman was 
 a I -"rercliman, and knew rot a word of Enghfh, but that I 
 would act a c . a c-Urk between them. And ndeed this Bufl- 
 nefi met v>i.h fuch fptedy fuccefs, that they all told me 
 
 I 3 
 
 
 in a few mis utes after, that they wsre ready to be formally 
 married, as icon as I pleafed ; with which informing the 
 priefJ, he was exceedingly rejoiced.. 
 
 Nothing now remained, bat that the women fkould be 
 made fennble of the meaning of the thing ; with which be» 
 ing well fatisfied, they, with their hufbands, a tended at my 
 apartment the next morning ; there, was my prieft, habited 
 in a black ve;*, fome^hing like a caffock, With a fath round 
 it, much refembling a nnniiler, aad J was hs interpreter. 
 But the ferioufnefs of his behaviour, and the fcruples he 
 made of roairying the women who were not bsp ized, gave 
 Ihem an exceeding reverercefor his perfon : nor, indeed, 
 would he marry thenTat all, till he .obtained my liberty ta 
 di/courfe both with the men and women, and then he told 
 them, That in the fight of all indifferent men, and in the 
 fenfe of the laws of fociety, they had lived in open adultery, 
 which nothing now, but their confent to marry, or final 
 feparation, cou!d put an end ;o; and even here was a diffi- 
 culty with refpeel to the laws of Chriitian malrirnor.y, in 
 marrying a prof /Ted Chriflian to a heathen idolater, un- 
 baptized; but >et there was" time enough to make them 
 profefs the ra-ne of Chrift, without which nothing could be 
 done ; that, belUes, he believed -they were very indifferent 
 Chnitians : and cenfecjuently had net difcourfrd with the'r 
 wives upon that fubject ; and that unlefs they promifed 
 him to co {6, he could not marry them, as being exprefsly 
 forbidden by the laws t/f God. 
 
 Ail this they had heard attentively, and owned readily. 
 
 " But, Lord, Sir,'* faid Will Atkins to me, " how mould 
 we te-ich them religion, w. o km w nothing of it ourfehes? 
 H w can we talk to our wives of God, Jefus Chrirr, hea- 
 ven and neil ?" why they would orly laugn at us, whonevtr 
 yet have praclifed religion, but on the contrary ail manner 
 of wiefcednefs." " Will A-kins," fald I, " cannot you tell 
 your wife fhe is in the vviorg, and that her gods' are idols,, 
 which can neither fpeak nor underftand ; but that our God, 
 who has made, can deftroy all things; that he rewards the 
 good and puniihes the wicked; and at Jail will bring us to 
 kdgmert? can not you tell her thefe things ?" l < That's 
 true," faid Will Atkins, " but then (he'll telJ me it ts utterly 
 falfe, fince I am net pumfhed ard fent to the devil, who 
 hath been fuch a wicked creature." Tnefe words 1 inter- 
 preted to the prieit. " Oh !" faid he, u tell him, his repvnt- 
 
 
 snce will make him a very good minifter to Us fpoufe, ard 
 qualify him to preach on the mercy and long-fuffering of a 
 merciful Being, Who defires iM the death of a lime , and 
 eve^ defers damnation to the laft judgment ; this will lead" 
 him to the doctrme of the refurreclion, and will ma^e him 
 an excellent preacher to his wife." I repeated tnis to A kins, 
 who being more th^n c rduarily aftect> d with it, replied, 
 << 1 know all this, Sir, ard a great deal mere ; hut how can 
 I have the impudence to talk thus to my wife, when my 
 ernfeience wxtnenes againft me ?" " Mss !" faid he, (with 
 leas in his eyes, and giving a great figh,) (i as tor repenting, 
 that is for ever paft me." •« Paft y ul A k ns/' laid 1, 
 * 4 what do yoa mean?" (t You Know* » eil enough," faid he, 
 u what I mean ; I mean it is too late." 
 
 When* I told the nrieft what he ferd, theroor affectionate 
 man could not refrain from weepmv ; b«t recovering' 
 himfelf, «' Pray, Sir," faid he, «' affc hi r it he is contented 
 that it is loo late; or is he concerned; ami w(h?s it were

 At this the C-ergyman (hook his head : " Sir," faid be, 
 " pray tell hitn it is not too late ; Chrift will give him re* 
 pert f. ante,, if he has* recourfe to ih« merit of Mspaflion.— 
 Does he think he is beyond the power of Divine Mercy ? 
 There may indeed be a time when provoked Tiercy will no 
 longer ftrive, but neve r too late for men to repent in this 
 World." I told Alkins every w? rd the preft had faid, who 
 then parted from us to walk with his wife, while we dif- 
 cour fed with the reft. But thefe were very ftupid in reli- 
 gious matters : yet all of them promised o do their endea- 
 vours to make their wives turn Ghrillia^V; and upon which 
 promifes the preft married the three couple. But £s At- 
 kins was the mly fincere convert, and if more fenie than 
 the re it, my clergyman w?s earneitly inquiring after him : 
 "Sir," faid he, "let us wak oai oi this labyrinth, and j 
 dare fay we fhall rind' this poor man preaching to his wife : 
 already." And indeed we f und it true ; tor com ; ng to trie 
 edge of the wood, u e perceived Atkins and his favage wife 
 fitting under the (hade, of a bullx, in \ery earnefi difcotttfe^

 he pcintec! to the fun 10 th quarters of th'e earth, tohimfelf, 
 to her, the wo.d^ and the tr cs. Immediately wt c -uld 
 perceive him Hart upon his feet, h)\ down upon hi knees, 
 and lift up both his Wis; at whicn.the t?*»Jfs ran down my 
 clergyman's ch~:k>:: bu; our great mLfortune was, we 
 -could not hear one'wo-d, that. polled between them. Ano- 
 ther time he would embrace her, wi ing the tears frofr. her 
 eyes, killing her with the greater* i.ranfp rts, and then bo'.h 
 N kneel down for for,c minutes together. S.>ch raptures of 
 joy did this occadon in my young pricny that he could 
 fcarcely- contain himfelf : And a little after this we obferved 
 by her motion as 'r;q tently lifting up herh^nds, and laying 
 them on he> br. aft, that (he was migiuily effected with 
 his difcourie, and fo they wjtndrew from ou'- fight. 
 
 When we canne ba^k we found them both waiting to be 
 called in; upon when we agreed to examine him ><lone, and 
 fo I began thus to difcourfe to him. " P»ith e, Will Atkias," 
 faid I, " what education ha vz you f What was your Father ?" 
 
 W. A. A better man than ever I (hall be; he was, Sir, a 
 clergyman, who gave- me pood inftructioo, or correction, 
 which I defpifed, like a bru e as I was, a id murdered my 
 po r fa her. 
 
 Pr. Ha ! a rrurdercr ! 
 
 [Here the Priejl ftarled and looked pale H gs think: ng he had 
 really killed his bather ] 
 
 R. G> What, did you kill Him with your hands? . 
 
 W* A. No, Sir, 1 cut not his ihr. at, but broke his heart 
 by the m ft unnatural turn of difobedience to the tendered 
 raid beft oi fathers. 
 
 R. C. Well, I pray God grant you repentance: I did 
 not afk you to extort a confdfiun; but I afk you becaule I 
 fee you have mere knowledge of what is geod than your 
 tomraniorc. , 
 
 W\ A. O Sir, whenever, I look b?ck upon my pad life,

 K. Q You talk, Will, too feelingly and fenfibly forme;

 "IV. A. You bear i , Sir ! you know nothing of it. 
 
 R. C. But yes, Atkins, 1 cio : and every fhore, valley, 
 and tree in the bland, v-itnefs the anguiih of my foul for 
 my u?, dutiful ,efs to my kind father, whom 1 have murder-

 But, Will, how comes the fenfe of this matter to touch yoa 
 juit no* ? 
 
 W* A. Sir, the work you have fet me about, has occa- 
 sioned it; for talking to my wife about God and religion, 
 ihe has "preached me fuch a fermon, that I lhail retain is 
 in Jading remembrance. 
 
 R. C. No, no, it is your own moving pious arguments to 
 her, has made confc knee fling them hack upon you. But 
 pray, Atkins, inform us what p a fied between you and your 
 wife, and in what manner did you begin. 
 
 W. A. I ;aiked vo her of the laws of marriage, the reafon 
 of fuch compacts whereby order-and jullice is maintained ; 
 without which men wu id run from their wives and children, 
 to the diflblution of fanil.es or inheritances. 
 
 R. K Well, and whit did me fay to all this f '

 THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN WILL ATKJNSaNB^ 
 HI 6 WIFE, IN THE WOOD. 
 
 Wife. — YOU tell me marriage God appoint, have youv^ 
 God in f your country ? 
 
 JV. A- Yes, child, God is in every nation. 
 
 Wife. No; great old Benamuckee God is in my country, 
 not yours, 
 
 JV. A. My dear, God is , in heaven, which he made; h£v 
 alfo made the earth, the fea, and all that is therein. 
 s Wife. W.hy you ^ot tell me mush iong ago ? 
 
 W. A My dear, I have been a wicked wretch, having a 
 long time lived without the knowledge of God in the worlde 
 
 Wife. What, not know great God in own nation \ No 
 do fcood ting ? No lay O to.him ? that's flrangei 
 
 W. A. But, my dear, many live as if there was no God 
 in heaven, for ail that. 
 
 Wife. Why God fuffer them; why make e not live well? 
 ' W. A. It is our own faults, child. 
 
 Wife. But if he istnuch great, caamakee kill, why no 
 fnakee kill when bo ferve him % No begood mans, no cry 
 Q to him r . . ., . 
 
 
 W. A. That's true, my dear, he may ftrike ua dead, bvfct 
 his abundant mercy fpareth us 
 
 Wife. Did not you tell God tankee for that ? 
 W. A. No, I have neither thaked him for his mercy, nor 
 feared him for his power. 
 
 tyrfk* Then me not believe your God be good, nor m ,kee 
 kil}, when you make him angry. 
 
 W. A, Ahs! mull ray wicked life hinder you from be- 
 lieving in him? 
 
 Wife How can me tin k your God live there? (pointing to- 
 Heaven.) Sure he no ken what do you- here. 
 
 W. 4. Ye?, my dear, he hears us (peak, fees what we do^ 
 and knows what we even thnk. 
 
 Wife. Where then makee power flrong, when he hears you 
 curfe, fwear de great d^mn ? 
 
 W. A. My dear, this (hows indeed he is a God and not 
 a man, who has fuch tender mercy. 
 Wife. Mercy ! what you call mercy ? 
 W. A. He piiies and/p^res us : as he is our great Creator, 
 fo he is alfo our Under Father. 
 
 Wife. So God never angry, never kill wicked, thlithena 
 good, no great mighty. 
 
 IV. A. O, my dear, don't fay fo, he is both; and many 
 times he ihows terrible examples of his judgment and ven- 
 geance. 
 
 Wife. Then you makee de bargain with him; you do bad 
 Vng, he no hurt you, he hurt other man?.. 
 
 IV. A. No, indeed my fins are all preemptions upon his 
 goodnefs. 
 
 Wife. Well,, and yet no make^ you dead ; and you give 
 him no tankee net* her? 
 
 W. A. it is true 1 am an ungraceful, unthankful dog, that 
 I am. 
 
 Wife. Why, you fay be makee yon, why makee you no 
 jsnicb better then? 
 
 W. A. It is I alone that have deformed myfelf, and abufed 
 his goodnefs. 
 
 Wife. Pray makee God know me, me no makee him an- 
 oxy, no do bad ting". 
 
 IV. A. You mean, my dear, that you defire I would teach 
 you to know God : alas ! poor dearcreature, he muft teach 
 ihee, and not f. But Til pray eameftly to him to direct 
 thee, and to forgive me., a mif-rable firmer. (Hereupon ho 
 
 
 went a little difiance, and kneeling down, p-aved earneftly 
 to .Gcd to enlighten her mind, and to pardo- his fins ; when 
 this wss done, they continued their difecurfe thus ;) 
 
 Wife. What you put down knee for? For wt<at hold up 
 hand ? Who yoa ipeak to ? 
 
 W. A. My dear, I bowed in token of fubmifli -n to him * 
 that made me, and prayed that he would open your eyes - 
 and iinderir.anding. 
 
 Wife. And can he do that too? And will he hear what 
 you fay ? 
 
 W. A. Yes, my dear, he bids, us pray, and has given us ^ 
 promife that he will hear us. 
 
 Wife. When did he bid yeu pray ? What ! do you hear 
 him (peak ? 
 
 W\ A. No, my dear, but God has. fpeken formerly to 
 good men from heaven: and by divine revelation they have 
 written all his laws down in a book** 
 
 Wife. Q where that good book ? - 
 
 Wi A. 1 have it not now by me; but one time or other 
 I fh all get it for you to read. Then he embraced her wiih 
 g*eat affection. 
 
 Wife. Pray tell me, did God teachee them write that book -i 
 
 W. A. Yf Si and by that rule we know him to be Gcd. 
 
 Wife.. What way, what rule you know him? 
 
 W. jL Beeaufe he teaches what is good, juft, and holy ; 
 and forbids all wicked- and abominable actions that incur 
 his difpleafupe, 
 
 h lift. O me fain underftand that, and if he do all things 
 you fay he do, (\ittly he hear me fay O to him ; " he makee 
 me good if I wifh to be good ; he not kill me if I love him ;, 
 me tink, believe him- great God; me fay O to him, along; 
 with you, my dear. 
 
 Here the poor man fell upon his knees, and made her 
 knfel down by him, prayirg.with the greateft fervency^ - 
 that God would inftruft her by his Holy Spirit;, and that 
 God, by his providence, would fend them a Bible fcr both 
 their inftruclions. And fuch was the early piety of this 
 rew convert, that fhe made him promife never to fcrfake 
 God any more, left being made dead, as Ihe called it, fhe 
 fhould not only want her inftru&er, but himfelf be mifer- 
 able in a leng eternity. 
 
 Such a lurpiifing account as this was, proved very at-- 
 fe£ting to us both, but particularly to the young clergyman^ 
 
 
 who was mightily conce rned he could not talk to her hlmfelf ; 
 ** Sit," f^id he, ' there is fomething more to be done to 
 this womar than to marry her : I mean that (he ought to 
 be baptized." To <his I prefently agreed; <c Pray,'* faid 
 he, « afk her hujband, whether he has ever talked to her of 
 Jefus Cr>rift> the falvation of finue-rs, the nature of faith, and 
 redemption in and by him, and of the Ho-y Spirit, the refur- 
 reclion, lafl judgment, and a future flate;" but the poor 
 feliow melted into tears at this queftion, faying that he had 
 faid fometrung to her of thefe things, but his inability to 
 talk of them, made him afraid; left her knowledge of them 
 Should lather make h r contemn religion, than be benefited 
 by it; but that if I would difcourfe with her, it would be 
 very evident my. labour would not be in vain. Accord- 
 ingly I called her in, a^d placi g myfcif as interpreter be- 
 tween the religious prieft and the woman, I entreated him 
 to go on ; but furely rever was fuch a fermon preached by 
 any clergyman in thefe latter days, with (o much ze?l, know- 
 ledge, «nd finceritj r: fin fhort, he brought the woman to 
 embrace the knowledge of Cnrifr, . a» d of r-demptijn by 
 him, with fo furp ifmg a degree -of uaderftandir.g, that (he 
 
 -m'ade U her own requeft to b; baptized 
 
 He then performed his office in ihe facrarnent of baptifm, 
 firft, by faying feme words over to himfelf in Latin, ar>d 
 then afking me to' give her a name, as beirg her godfather; 
 and youing a whole diihful of water upon the woman's 
 hexd, he faid, u Mary, I baptize thee in the name of the 
 
 .Father, and of -the Son, and of the Holy 'Ghoft;" fo that 
 none could know of wh3t religion he was. After this he 
 pronounced the -benediction .in Laiio. Thus the woman 
 being made a ChrinMan, he married.her to Will Atkins: 
 which be'ng fi imed, he affectionately- exhorted him to 
 lead a holy life for the future; and fince the Almighty, for 
 the convictions of his con r cie> ce, had honoured him to be 
 the inftiument of his wife's conversion, he ihould not dis- 
 honour j he grace of God, that while the favage was con- 
 verted, the indrament fhouid be caft awa>. Thus ended a 
 ceremony, tome the mcft pleafant and agreeable I ever 
 pafi'ed in my life. 
 
 Tne a#air.s of the iHand being fettled, I was preparing to 
 go on board, when theycung man (*hofe mother was fkrv- 
 ed) came to me, faying-, that as he underilood I had a cler- 
 gyman with .roe, who had married the Engiiftimen with 
 
 
 favages, he had a match :o make between two Chriftian s 
 which he' defired might be flni(hed before I departed,.— 
 Thinking that it was he himfelf that had courted his mother's 
 maid ; I perfuadei him not to do any thing raihly up~n the 
 account of his folitary circumfUnces ; that the maid was an 
 unequal match for him, both in refpecVto fubiiance and 
 years ; and that it was very probable he would live to re- 
 turn to his < wn country, where he might have a far better 
 choice At thvfe words, fmiling, he interrupted me, thank- 
 ing me for my good advice ; that -as he had nocii g to beg 
 of me but a frtrifl fettle men ? , with a feivant or two, or fome 
 few re elTa ies, fo he hoped I would not be unmindful of 
 him when I returned to England, but give his letter to his 
 friends; and that when he was redeemed, the plantation, 
 and all its improvements, however, valuable, mould be -.re- 
 turned to me again. But as for the marria e he propo ed r 
 that it was not himfelf, but that it was between my Jack-of- 
 all-tr d?s and the maid Sufan. 
 
 I was indeed agreeably furprifed at the mentioning this 
 match, which, feezed very suitable, the one being a very 
 ingenious fellow, and the other an excellent, dexterous, and 
 feniible houfe^ife, fit to be governefs of the whole ifland : 
 fo we married them the fame day ; and as I was her father 
 and gave her away, fo I gave her a handfome p rtion, ap- 
 pointing her and her h fbanda convenient large ipot of 
 ground for their plantation. The fnaring out of the land I 
 left to Wi!l Atkins, who really djvided it very juftly, to 
 every perf n J s fa ti>f action; they only defired one* general 
 writing under my hand for the whole, which I cauled to be 
 drawn up, hgmd, and fealed to them, fett-ng out the'r 
 bounds, and giving them a right to the whole poffeffion of 
 their re'ptctive plantations, with their improvements, to 
 them and their heirs, refervirg all the reit of the ifland as 
 irtv own property, and a certain rent for every particular 
 plantation, after eleven years. As to their laws and go- 
 vernment, I exhorted them to love one another ; and ys to 
 the Indians who lived in a nook b> themiebes, i allotted 
 three or four of them plantations, ard thr reit willingly 
 chofe to become forvams to the other families, by wh.'ch, 
 means they were employed in ufeful labrur, and fared 
 much better than they did before. Befide> thg: favages be- 
 ing thus mixed with the Chaflians, the work cf their con- 
 vt$?dh ftr&ht be fet on foot by the latter, in ihz cUrgy- 
 
 
 roan's abfence, to our equal fatisfa&ion. The young prief£, 
 however, was a litcle anxic us left the Chriftians mould not 
 be willing- to do their parts in inMru&ing thefe poor Indi~ 
 ars ; I therefore told him we mould call them all together 5 
 that he mould fpeak to the Spaniards who were Papirts^ 
 and I to the Engliih who were Proteftant?,. and make them 
 promife that they would never make any diftin<5Hon in re- 
 Hgton, but reach the general true knowledge cf God, and 
 hs Son Jefus Chrift, in ord^rto convert the poor favages. 
 And thif, indeed, they all pro nifed us accordingly. 
 
 When I came to Will Atkins's houfe, I found his baptized 
 wife, and the >oung woman newly married to my Jack-of- 
 al:-trades, were become great intimates, and difcourfing of 
 religion together. " O, Sir/* fays Will Atkins, <c when 
 God has tinners to recorcile to himfelf, he never wants an 
 inftrucler; I knew I was unworthy of fo good a work, and 
 therefore this young woman has been fent hither as it were 
 from heaven, who is fufEcient to convert a whole nation of 
 favages." The young woman blufhed, and was going to 
 rife; but. I defired her to fit ftil'I, and hoped that God, 
 would blefs her in fo good a work ; and. then pulling out 
 a Bible, (which I brought on purpofe in my pcck^t for him,} 
 44 Here Atkins/* faid I, ** here is an afBi^ant that perhaps > 
 you had not before." So confounded was the poor man,, 
 that it was fome time before he could fpeak ; at laft turnings 
 to his wife, * 4 My dear," faid he, " did I not tell you that 
 God could hear what we faid ? Here's the book I prayed 
 for, *hen you and I kneeled under the bum ; God then, 
 heard us, and now has fert it." The woman was furprifed*. 
 and thought really God had fent that individual book from. 
 heaven ; but I turned to the young woman, and defired her 
 to explain to the young converts that God may properly be 
 faid to anfwer our petitions, when, in the courte of rrs pro- 
 vidence, fuch particular things came to pafs as we petition- 
 ed far* This the young woman did tffecTuaiiv; butfurely 
 Will Atkins's joy cannot be expreffed ; no man being more, 
 thankful lor any thing in the world, than he was for his 
 Bible f nor defired it in ma better principle. 
 
 After feveral religious difcourfes, 1 defired the young , 
 woman to give roe an account of the anguifh (be felt when, 
 fhe was ftarving to death with hunger ; to which (he readily 
 contented, and began in the following manner : 
 
 "Sir," faid (he, if all our vi&uals being gone, after I had. 
 failed one day, my ftomach was very fickly, and, at the ap- 
 
 
 preach of nighi, I was inclined to yawning and fleepy. — 
 When I flept upon the couch three hours, I awaked a lit- 
 tle reirefned : three hours-after, my ftomach being more 
 and mere ftckly, I lay down again, but could not Deep, be- 
 ing very faint and ill. Thus 1 p?ff^d the fecond day with- 
 a Grange variety, firft hungry, then fick again, with retch- 
 ings to vomit: that night I dreamed I was at Ba^bad es § . 
 buying plenty of proviu^ns, and dined heartily. But when 
 I awakened, my fpirits were exceedingly funk, to find myfelf 
 in' the ex remty of famine. There was but one gjafs of 
 wine, uhich being mixed with fugar, I drank up; but fit, 
 wart of fubftance to digeft upon, the fumes of it got into 
 my head, and made me fenfelefs fcr feme time. The third 
 day 1 was fo ravenous and f-rious, that I could have eaten 
 a little child if it had come in my way ; during which time 
 I was as mad as any creature in Bedlam. In ore of thefe 
 fits 1 fell down,, and ftruck my face againft- the- corner of 
 a pallet- bed, where my miftrefs lay ; the blood guih-ed out 
 of my nofe, but by my exceflive bleeding, both the violence 
 of the fever, and the ravenous part of the hunger abated. — 
 After this I grew fick again* it rove, to vomit but cculd not; 
 then bleeding a fecord time, 1 fwooned away as dead; 
 when I came to myfelf, I had a dreadful gnawing pain in 
 my ftomach, which went off towards night, with a longing 
 defire for food. I took. a draught of water and fugar, but 
 it came op again ; then I drank water witnout fugar, and 
 that (laid wi;h me^ I laid me down en the bed, praying 
 God would take me away : after I ha^Lflumbere d, J thought 
 myfelf a-dying, therefore recommended my foul to God^. 
 and wiftied iome body would throw me into the fea. All 
 this while my departing miftrefs lay by me ; the laft bit of 
 bread fte had, ill 3 gave to her dear child, my young matter. 
 The mcrning after I fell into a violent pailion of crying, 
 and after that irto hunger. I efpied the blcod that came 
 from my nofe in a bafin, which 1 immediately fwailowed 
 up. At ni^ht I had the ufual variations, as the pain in the 
 ftomach, iick, ileepy, and ravenous j and I had no thought 
 but that I ihould die before morning. In the morning came 
 on terrible gripings in my bowels. At this time I heard my 
 young- mailer's lamentations, by which I underftood his 
 mother was dead. Soon after this, the failors cried, « 4 At 
 fail! a fail V hallooing as if they were diftradled for joy of 
 ihat relief, which afterwards wc received from your bands..'* 
 
 
 Surely never was a more diftinct account of Carving to 
 death than this. But to return to the difp< fnion of things 
 among my people, I did not take any notice to them dfthe 
 floop that I had framtd, nei.her would I Itave them the 
 two pieces of brafs cannon, or the two qu rter-deck guns 
 that I had on boud, led upon any difguft, they fhould have 
 feparated, or turned piraes, ard fo m ke the ifland a den 
 of thieves, inflead ofa plantation of foher, pous people: 
 but leaving them in a fiourifhing conditio^, with a promife 
 to fend (hem furher relief from Brazil, as fheep, hogs, and 
 co\ys, (being obliged to kill the latter at fea, having no hay 
 to feed them,} 1 went on board the (hip again, the firft of 
 May, 1695, after having been twenty days among them ; 
 and next morr ing. giving them a falute of five guns at 
 parting, we let fail for the Brazils. The third day, towards 
 evening, there happening a calm, and the curr<nt being; 
 very flronu, we were drove to the N/N. E. towards the 
 land. Some hours after we perceived the fea covered 
 as it were with fomething very biack, not eafily at firil to 
 be difct vered: upon which our chief mate afcending the 
 jfhrouds a little way, and takiog a view wiih the perfpec- 
 tive glafs, he cries out, <4 An army ! an army I" u You 
 fool^ faid 1, " what do you mean?- ' ' Nay, Sir,'* faid he,.,. 
 44 don^t b.e angry, I aflure you it is not only an army, but a 
 fieei too, for I believe there are a (houfand canoes paddling, 
 along, and making with geat haOe towards us/ r 
 
 Indeed, every one of us were furprifed at this relation ; 
 and my 4 ephew f the -.captain-, could not tell what to think 
 of.it, but ir:o ght we* fhcud ail be devoured. Nor was I 
 free from co cern, when I confidered how much we were 
 becalmed, ano what a llrong current fe* Jjw.a ds the ihpre ; 
 however, I enccuraged him not to be afraid, but bring the 
 fhip o an anchor, as foon as we were certan that we rnuit 
 engage them. Accordingly we did fo,, ar)d fueled all our 
 fails; as to the favaoe> we feared nothing, but only that 
 they might fet the ihip on fire ; to p- even, which, I ordered 
 theiri to ge>: thdr boats out, and fallen them cne cl- fe by the 
 head, and an ther by the item, well manned, with fkee:s and 
 buckets to exunguiih the flames, fhould it fo tappen. The 
 favages foon came up with us, but there were not fo many 
 as the mate had faid, for inilead of a thoufind can- es there 
 were only one hundred and twenty ; too many indeed for 
 14s, feveral of their canoes containing about fixteen or feven- 
 icen men 
 
 
 
 As they approached us, they feemed to he in the great- 
 ell amazement, bat knowing what to ma!?? of us. They 
 rowed round the (lap, which * ccaiioned us to call to the 
 men in the hoais not ^o fuffer tneol to come near t'n.em. — 
 Hereupo j 'hey beckoned to the iavages to keep'back, which 
 \h y accordingly did; but at their retreat they let fly about 
 rifcy arrows among us, and very much wounded one of our 
 men in the long-boat. I called to them not to lire upon 
 any account, but handing them d wn fome deal boads, the 
 carpenters made them a kind of fence to iliield thern from 
 the arrows. In half &n hour after they came fo. near a (lent 
 of us, that we had a per fed fight of them; then they rowed 
 a little fur the pur, till they came direitly a'ong-fiie of us,, 
 and thea approached fo near/ that they could hear u; f eak: 
 this made me order all my men .to- keep dole, and get their 
 guiiv ready. In the mean time I ordered Friday'to go out 
 upon deck, and afk them in his language what they means. 
 No foor.er did he do fo, Jbnt fix of the favages, who were 
 in the former canoes, iiooping down, fhowed us their 
 naked backfides as much as to fay in Engiitb, Kifs our 
 ~: bat Friday quick y knew what this meant, by im- 
 mediately crying out they were g.'ing'to fho^t; unfortu- 
 nately fjr him, po^r creature, who fell under the clou> of 
 thre hunored arrows, no lefs than fcven piercing tnrough 
 his body, killing one of the bed fervaU*, and faithfuiieft of 
 compan ons in all my folitudes and cffielion. 
 
 So enraged was I at the death of poor Friday, that the 
 guns, which before were eharged only with pawder, ta 
 frighten them, I ordered to be ioaded.with fmall (hot ; nor 
 did the gunners fail in their aim, but at this broad fide f pi it 
 and overftt thirteen or fourteen of their canoes, which 
 killed numbers of them, and fet the reft a fwirmning : the 
 others, frightened out of their wits, little regarding their 
 fel'ows drowning, fcoured away as fall as they could. One 
 poor wretch our people took uo, f.vimming for his life, an 
 hour after. He was very lullen at firft, fo that he would 
 neither eat nor fpeak ; but 1 took a way to cure him, by 
 ordering them to throw him ino the fea, which ihey did, 
 and then he came fwimrning back like a cork, calling in his 
 tongue, as I fuppofe, to fave him. So we took nim on 
 board, but was a long time before we could make him fpeak 
 or ur.derftand Bngiiih : yet when we had taught h m, he 
 iold us, ihey wer j going with their kings to light a great 
 
 
 battle ; and when we afked him, what made them come up 
 to us? he faidy f to makee de gtet wonder look;" here 
 it is to be rioted, that thofe natives, and thofe of Africa, 
 always add two € J s at the end of Englilh word", as makee, 
 takee, and ?he like. From which it is a very difficult thing to 
 make them break off. 
 
 Being now under fa'!, we took cur lart farewell of poor 
 honeft Friday, and interred him with all poffib!e decency 
 and folemnity, putting him in a coffin, and committing 
 him to the deep, at the fame time caufing eleven guns to 
 be bred over him. Thus ended the life of one of the moil 
 grateful, faithful, honeit, and affectionate fervants, that ever* 
 any man was blelFed with in the worlds 
 
 Havng now a f*ir wind for Erazil, in about twelve days* 
 time we made land in -he latitude of five degrees Youth of 
 the li e. Four days we k^ptonS* by E.in fight of (here, 
 when we made Capt St. \uv-uftine, and in three d<*ys we 
 came up to an anchor off the Bay of ail Saints* I had great 
 difficulty here to get leave ro hold correfpondence on more; 
 for neither the figure of my partner, my t>o merchant trus- 
 tees, ror the fame of my wonderfuT preservation in the 
 iila^d, could procure me the favour, till fush time as the 
 p i^r of the monaiier* of ike Augu (lines (to whom 1 had 
 given 500 moidores) ob ained leave from the Governor, for 
 me, perfmalJy, with rhe Captain and one mre, toge her 
 with eight lailcrs, tocom? on fliore ; upon this c ncittion a 
 that we fhould net. 1 nu any good* out of the fhip, nor 
 carry any perfo^ a*a* without licence: I found means> 
 however, to get t fhore three bales t$. Englifh goods, fuch 
 as fin* broad cloths, fluffs, and fame linen, which I brought 
 as a prefenfr for my partner, who had feat me on b)ard a 
 prefenr. of frefh provifi ns wine, and fweetmeatSj worth 
 about thity moidores. including fame tobacco, and three 
 or four fif e gold medals. 
 
 Here I delivered my partner in goo^s. to the value of 
 100/. iteming, and obliged him to fit up the floop I bought 
 for the iify of mv ifland, in order lo (e d t^em refreshments ; 
 and fo active was he in this matter, that he had the veiTel 
 first (he d in a lew days, to the mailer of which'- L gave par- 
 ticular mfl ucTiOns to find the place. I Den loaded him 
 with a fmali c;n go ; and one of our failors offered to fettle 
 there,, upon roy letter to the Spanith governor, if I would 
 allot hioi tools and a.plantation. Tnis I /iilingiy granted* 
 
 
 and gave him the favage we had taken prifoner to be his 
 flave. Ail things being ready for the voyage* my old 
 partner toli me there wss an acquaintance of his, a Brazil 
 planter, who having fallen under the difpleafare of the 
 church, and in fear of the Inquifition, which obliged him to 
 be concealed, would be glad of fuch an opportunity to 
 make his efcape, with his wife and two daughters ; acd if I 
 would allot them a plantation in my ifland, he w uid give 
 them a fmall ftock to begin with, for that the officers had al- 
 ready fcized his effecls and etlate, and left him nothing but 
 a little houfehold fluff and two flaves. This requeil I pre- 
 fently granted, concealing him and his family on board our 
 ihip, till fucn time as the 11 op (where all the effefls were) 
 was gone out of the bay, and then we put them on board, 
 who cam* d /ome materials, and plants for planting f Jgar- 
 canes, ah ng wi h them. By this do p, among other things 
 I fern my fubjects three milch cows and five calves, about 
 22 hogs, three fows big with pig, two mares an i a flonr- 
 horfe. I alfo engaged three Portugal women to go for fake 
 of the Spaniards watch, whh the p*rfecuted man's two 
 daughters, were fufficient, iince the reft had wives of their 
 own, though in an ther country; all which cargo arrived fafe, 
 no c'oubr, to their exceeding comfort, who, with this addi- 
 tion, were about fixty or feventv people, befides children. 
 
 At" this place, my truiy honeft and pious clergyman left - 
 me; for a (hip being ready to fet fail for Lifbo/^, he afked 
 me leave to go thither; but I affure you it was with the 
 greateft reluctance I parted from a perfon, whofe virtue 
 and piety merited the greeted cfleem. 
 
 From the Brazils, we made cirecily over the Atlantic 
 Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope, having a tolerable good 
 voyage, fleering for the moll part S. E. We were on a 
 trading voyage, and nad a fup^rcargo on board, who was 
 to dirtctali the ihip's motions alter me arrived at the Gape, 
 only being limited to a certain number of days, for (lay, oy 
 charter party, at the feveral ports (he was to go to. At the 
 Cape we only took in frefh water, ar d then failed for ths 
 coaft of Coromandel ; we were there informed, that a French 
 man of war of 50 guns, and two large mercnant fhips, were 
 failed for the Indks, but we heard no more of them. 
 
 In ovr paffage, we touched at the ifland <->f Madagafcar K 
 where, though the inhabitants are naturally fierce and trea,- 
 
 
 cherous, and go conftatly armed with hows and lances, 
 yet for foH;e tim the. tre ted us civilly em ugh ; snd, in 
 exchange for k* i es, teiffors, an 1 oth r trifles, t;;ey brought 
 us eleven good fai bul cks, whic'i we to k partly for pre- 
 lent vicna s, and the rem incer to fait for the (hip's ufe. 
 
 So curi us was I to view every corner of the world where 
 I came :0, th-ii I went on fiiore as often as F cou'd. One 
 evening when on more, we qbferved numbers of he re pie 
 Hand gazi? g at us at a di knee. We thought ourfelves in 
 rfo danger, ~as they haa hitherto ufed cs kindly. However 
 we cu three b ughs rut of a tree, ftlck'ng them at a dftance 
 from us, which it feems in that count v, is not only a token 
 of truce and anrty, bu when poes or bjnghs are fet up on 
 the o her fide, it is a fign he truce is accepted. In 
 thefe treate* , however, there i one pnndpai tring to be 
 regarded, that neither pary com beyond ere another** 
 three poles or bough- ; fo that the middle tpace is not only- 
 fecure, but is alfo allowed as h market f r traffic tni com- 
 merce. When the truce is thus accepted, they itick up 
 their javelins and lances at the firft p »les, and come on un- 
 armed ; but if any violence is offered,- away they run to 
 their poIeSi take up their w. ap ns ? aid r hen the truce is 
 at an end. TV is eve? ing it happened th vt a greater num- 
 ber of people than ufoal, boh men and women, traded 
 among us for ftch toys as we fud, with iuch great civility^ 
 that we made us a little tent, of largi' boughs of trres, fome 
 of the men refolving to lie on fhore ail night ; bat for my 
 part, I and fome ot ers took our lodgings in the beat, with 
 boughs of trees fpread ever it, having a fail fpread at the 
 bottom to lie up n. About two o 5 clock in the ma-n ; ng we 
 we're awakened by the firing of mufket*, and our men cry- 
 ing out for help, or elfe they would all be" murdered. Scarce 
 had we vmt ? .o get the b at afhore, when our men came 
 plunging themfelves in*a the «aer, with about four hun- 
 dred of the iflanders at their heels. We took". up feven of 
 tile mm, three of them very much wounded, and one left 
 behind killed, while the enemy poured their arrows {a 
 thick among us, that we were forced to make a barricado, 
 with boards lying at the fide of the boat, tofhield us from 
 clanger; and, having got' ready our fire-arms, we returned 
 them a volley, which wou- d:d fevera! of them'-, as. we could 
 hrar by their cries. I this condition we rfe) till break of 
 day, and then making fignais of dill rcli to the fhip> which 
 
 
 my nephew, thecapi3 : n, heard and underflow, he weighed 
 anchor, and ftipo4 as rear, ihe there a.-   prffio'e, and then 
 {*« t another boat w^h ten h.\nds fa her to fcftiit us bm we 
 called to them not t; come near, inf -, rising thorn of our un- 
 happy condition. Howeve> th: y ; entund ; wftfcfo one of 
 -the men takng the end of a tow H e i - one kahdj and keep- 
 ing our boat between k;m ^nd ur V-ve-rfVies, Fwa<B ;o u^ 
 and flipping ur cables, 'he* to •-, i us oil of reacts of their 
 ar<* ws, en quicklv alter a br v.dftde *-j& s;iv:n them from 
 the ftiip, which made? mo ! * d?#adf&] havoc is among them. 
 When we g^t on board, we *xamned into the occaiion of 
 this- fray. Thv men who fi; i informed u^, that an eld wo- 
 man, who f Id m;lx within the po'es, had brought a young 
 woman with her* who carried roots and nerb, he fight of 
 whom fo much tempted our men, that hev offered rude- 
 nefs to the maid, at which ri?e o*d *oman fei up a great 
 cry; nor would the failci-s parlwit.i their prize, } :u cirricd 
 her among 'the trees, while the old warn a-.? weit and 
 bro .-ght a whole army down upon them. At .he beginning 
 cf the attack, one of our Dies was killed \vvh a 1- nee, and 
 the fellow who began the mifchief paid dear enough for 
 h'n miitrefs, tho;gn as yet we did not know what h^d be- 
 come of him; the reft luckily elcaped. The third night 
 after' the action, being cur ous to underhand how affairs 
 flood, 1 took the iuptrcargo and twen.y (tout fellows with 
 me, and landed about two hours before midnight at the fame 
 place where thof: Indians flood tl e night be ore, and there 
 we divided our men into two bodies, the ho tfwain com- 
 manding one, and I ano her. It was fo dark, that we 
 could fee nob dy, neither did we hear anv voice near us ; 
 but by and by the boatfwain falling over a dead body, we 
 agreed to hah till the moon ihould rife, which we knew 
 would be an h ur afrer. We perceive! here no fewer than 
 two and thirty bo ies upon the ground, v -hereof two were 
 not quite dead. Satisfied with this discovery, I was for go- 
 ing ojg board again ; bui the boatfwaio'ani t e reft told me, 
 they would make a vifi; to the Indian town, where thefe 
 dogs, fo they called them, refided, afking me at the fame 
 time to go along with them, for they did not ckmbt, befides 
 getting a good booty, but they fhould find Tom Jeffery 
 there, for that was the unhappy man «e miffed But I 
 utterly refufed to go, and commanded them back, being 
 
 
 unwilling to hazard their lives, as the fafety of the fh'-p 
 wildly depend d upon them. Notwithftanding all 1 could 
 fay to them, they al left me but one, and the fup^rca go ^ 
 fo we three returned to the boat, where a boy was left, re- 
 volving to Hay iiil they murned. At parting I told them 
 I fuppofed moft of them would run the fame fate with Tom 
 JefV-ry. To this they replied, f * Come boys, come along, 
 we'll warrant we'll come off fafe enough;" and fo away 
 they went notwithftanding all ray admonitions, either con- 
 cerning their own fafeiy or t e preservation of the fhip. — 
 Indteo they were gallantly armed, every m*n having a 
 mufltet, bayonet, and a piftl, befuies cutUffes, hangers, 
 pole-axes, and hand-granades. T^ey came to a few In- 
 dian houfesat fir ft, wnich not being the town they expected, 
 t v ey went farther, and rinding a cow tied to a tree, they 
 concluded that five would be a fufficient guide, and fo it 
 proved ; for after the* untied her, -fhe led them directly 
 -to the town, which confided of above two hundred houies, 
 Several families living in feme of the huts together. At 
 their arrival, all be^g in a profound fleep, the failors agreed 
 to divide ^hemfelves into three b dies, and fet three parts 
 of the town on fire at once, to kill thofc that were efcaping, 
 and plunder the reft of the houfes. Thusdefpcrately re- 
 iblved, they w^ent to work ; but rive firft party had not 
 .gone for before thry called to the reft that they had found 
 Tom Jeffery ; whereupon they all ran up to the place, «nd 
 found the poor fellow indeed hanging up naked by one 
 arm, and his throat almoft cut from e^r to ear. In a houfe 
 that was hard by the tree, they found fix r ten orfevemeen 
 Indians, wh .had been concerned in the fray ; two or three 
 of hem being wounded, were not gone to fleep : this houfe 
 ihey fet ojj fire firft , and in a few m nutes a Her, rive o<- fix 
 places mre \r. the town appeared in .games. The c nfla- 
 gration fpread like wild-Jire, their houfes being all of wood, 
 and covered wirh Rigs or nifties. Th e poor affr g.hted in- 
 habitants endeavoured to run out o fave their hves, but 
 they were driven back ;nto the flames by the failors, and 
 kil'ed without mercy. At the firft houfe above men i6ned, 
 after the boatfw^tin bad fla<n two with his pole a.-xe, he threw 
 a hard-garade mt the h ufe, which bunting, maie a ter- 
 rible hav ck, killing and wounding moft f then*; and their 
 king i nd moft of h s tra'r, who were in ihat houfe, tell 
 vicliras to their fury, every creature of them being either 
 
 
 fmaothered or burnt. All this while they never fired a gun, 
 left trie people mould awaken farter than they cculJ over- 
 power them. But the fire awakened them fait enough, 
 which obliged our felloes to, keep together in bodies. By 
 this time the whole town was in a fl*me, yet the fury ra- 
 ther increased, calling out to one another o remember Tom 
 J>f7ery. The terrible light of this conflagration made me 
 very uneafy, and rouled my nephew the Captain, and the 
 reft of his men, who kn»w nothing of the matier. When 
 he perceived the dreadful fmoke, a-d heard the g^ns go 
 eff, re readily concluded his m-n were in danger; he there- 
 fore takes another boat, and cones afhore himfelf, with 
 thir een men well armed. He was greatly furprifed to fee 
 me and on y t»\o men in the boat, bir more fo when I told 
 him the (try ; but though 1 urged with him, as I did 
 with the men, about the dangers of the voyage, the interests 
 of the merchants and owners, an-i the fafety of the fhip, yet 
 my nephew, like the reft, declared, that he would rather 
 lofe the fhip, his voyage, his life and all, than his men mould 
 be loft for want of help; and fo away he wet. For my 
 part, fee-ng him refolved to go, I had not power to flay 
 behind. 'He ordered the pinnace back agaio for twelve 
 men more, and then we marched direclly as tfce flame 
 guided us. But finely never was fuch a fcerve of horror 
 beheld, or more difmal cries .heard, except wnen Oliver 
 .Cromwell took Drogheda, in Ireland, where he neither 
 fp^red man, wonun, nor child. 
 
 The firft object, I think, we met with, was the ruins of 
 one of their habitations, before which lay four men and three 
 women killed, and two more burnt to death amo^g the fire, 
 which was row decaying. Nothing could appear more 
 barbaous than this revenge; none more cruel than the 
 authors of it. As we went on, the fire increafed,.and thc_ 
 vry proceeded in proportion. We had rot gone much far- 
 ther, when we beheld three naked wornem, followed by fix- 
 teen or fevemeen men, flying with the greateft fwifWfs 
 from our men, who {hot one of hem in cur fight. When 
 they perceived u*, whom they fupp fed alio their murderers, 
 they dt up a m ift dread fulfhriek, and both of them fwoon- 
 td away in fright. This was a fight yvfricft might have 
 foftened the hardeft heart,; and in pity we took fon^e ways 
 to let them know we would not hurt them, while the poor 
 creatures, with beuded knees and lifted-up hands, made 
 
 
 piteous lamentations to us to fave their lives. I ordered 
 cur men net to hurt any of the poor creatures' whatioever; 
 bm beint? willing to un detlland the occasion of all this, I 
 went among thef im ap y .wretches, who Neither under- 
 lie od me nor the good I meant them, However, teirg 
 reload to put an ej.d to this barbarity, i ordered the men 
 to follow me. We h:6 not gc e fifty yards before -we c->me 
 up wah. th boatfvvai r., with four of our men at his heels, all 
 or -hem coy red with blood and dUiir, and in fearch of mere 
 people to fatiafe 1 their vengeance. A* foojn a^ we fhsv them 
 we called out vd nude them underfland who we were; 
 upon which V ey rnu up to us, fettipg up a halloo of tri- 
 umph, in toke :hat more help Wcs come. u N bleCartain," 
 (aid he to my nephew,' " I'm glad you're ccntei ; we have 
 not half done with thefe vilianous hellhound dog- ; we'll 
 root cut the very nati r n o ti em from the earth and kill 
 more >han poor Tom has hairs upon his hesd :" and thus he 
 went en till I interrupted him — ,c Blcod-thirily dog," faid 
 I, "will your cruelty never end? I charge you touch n ,tone 
 creature more; Hop >our hands and 'Sand flill, or you're 
 a dead man this moment. 5> "Why, Sir," faid he, « c you 
 neither know whom you are protecting, nor whatt*.ey have 
 done: but pray come hither, and behold an inftance of 
 companion, if fuch can merit your clemency ;" and with 
 that he (hewed me the poor fellow with his throat cut, 
 hanging upon the tree. 
 
 Indeed, here was enough to fill their breads w.th rage, 
 which, ho-ever, I thcught had gone too far, agreeab'e to 
 thefe words of Jai ob to his f,ns Simeon and Levi: " Curfed 
 be their arger, tor it was fierce; Mid their wrath, for it 
 was cruel." But this fight made my nephew and the 
 reft as had as they: nay, my nephew declared, his con- 
 cern was only f r hi> .men: as for the people, rot a foul 
 of them ought to live. Upon this, the boatfwain and eight 
 more directly turned about, and went to finifh the intended 
 tragedy ; which heing cut of my power to prevent, I re- 
 turned bnck from the djfma 1 iight; and the piteous cries of 
 thofe unfortunate creature s. who were made victims to their 
 fury. Indeed it was an egregious piece of folly in me to 
 return to the beat with b A o e attendant; and I had very 
 rear paid for it, having narrowly efcaped forty armed In- 
 eiars who- had been alarmed by the conflagration ; but 
 Laving piffed the pi^ce where they flood,! got to the boat, 
 
 
 accompanied with the fupercargo, and to went on board, 
 fending the pinnace back again, to affift the men in what 
 might happen. When I had got to the boar, the Rre was 
 almoft extinguiflied, and the noite abated; but I had fcarce 
 been half an hour on board the fhip, when 1 heard another 
 volley given by cur failors, and a great ftnoke, which, as I 
 afterwards found, was our men ('ailing upon thofe houfss 
 and perfons that flood between them and the fra; but here 
 they fpared the wives and children, and killed only the men, 
 to the number of about fixteen cr feventeen. By the time 
 they got to the (bore, the pinnace and the (hip's boat were 
 ready to receive them, and they all got fafe on board, not 
 a man of them having received the leaft hurt, except two, 
 one of them having {trained his foot, and the other burnt his 
 hand a li' tie ; for they met with no refinance, the poor 
 Indians be' ! ng unprepared, amazed, and crnfounded 
 
 I was extremely angry with every one of them, but par* 
 ticularly with the captain, who, inftead of cooling the rage 
 of the men, had prompted them on to further mifchief : nor 
 could he make me any other excufe, but that as he w r as a 
 man, he could not matter his pafTions at the fight of one of 
 his men fo cruelly murdered. As for the reit, knowing- 
 they were not under my command, they took no notice of 
 my anger, but rather boalled of their revenge. According 
 to all their accounts, they killed or destroyed ahcut 150 
 men, women, and children, befides burning the town to 
 afhes. 7 key tock their companion Tom JcrTtry frcm the 
 tree, covered him wiih fome of the ruins, and fo left him 
 But however this action of our men might feem to them 
 juitifiable, >et I always openly condemned it with the ap- 
 pellation of the Mafiacre of Madagascar. For though the 
 natives had (lain this JeiFery, yet cenainly he was the nrft 
 aggreiler, by attempting to violate the chaftity of a young 
 innocent woman, who ventured down to them, on the faith of 
 the public capitulation, which was fo treachercuily broken. 
 
 While we were under fail, the boatfwain would often 
 defend his bloody action, by faying, that the Indians had 
 broke the truce the night before, by (hooting one of our 
 men without juil provocation : and what if the poor fellow 
 had taken a little liberty with the wench, he ought not to 
 have been murdered in fo villanous a manner ; and that 
 they had adted nothing but what the divine laws commif- 
 fioned to be done to fuch homicides. However I was in 
 
 K 
 
 
 the fame mind as before, tel'ing tHem that they were mur- 
 cerers, and bid them depend upon it that God would blaft 
 their voyage, for fuch an unparalleled piece of barbarity. 
 
 When we came to the Gulph cf Perfia, five of our men 
 who ventured on (here, were either killed or made flaves 
 by the Arabians, the reft of them having fcarce time to, 
 efcape to their boat. This made me upbraid them afrefh 
 with the retribution of Heaven for fuch actions ; upon 
 which the boatfwain very warmly ?fked me, " Whether 
 thofe men on whom the tower of Siloam fell, were greater 
 finners than the reft of the Galileans ? and befides, Sir," 
 faid he, "none of thefe five poor men that are loft were 
 with us at the Maffacre of Madagafcar, as you call it, and 
 therefore your representations are very unjufl, and your ap- 
 plication improper. BeGdes," added he, u you are con- 
 tinually ufing the men very ill upon this account, and, be r 
 ing but a paffenger yourfelf, we are not obliged to bear it ; 
 nor can we tell what evil deiigns you may have to bring us 
 to judgment for it in England; and, therefore, if you do 
 not leave this dtfcourfe, as alfo not concern yourfelf with 
 any of our affairs, I will leave the /hip, and not fail among 
 fuch dangerous company." - - 
 
 All this I heard very patiently ; bujr, it being often re- 
 peated, I at length told him, the concern I had on board 
 was none of his bufinefs; that I was a confiderable owner 
 in the fhip, and therefore had a right to fpeak in common, 
 and that I was no way accountable to him, nor any body 
 clfe. As no more palfed for feme time after, I thought 
 all had been over. At this time we were in the road of 
 Bengal, where, going on fhore with the fupercargo one day, 
 In the evening, as I was preparing to go on boa d, one of 
 the men came to me, and told me, I need not trouble my- 
 felf to come to the boat, for that the ccckfwain and others 
 had 6-dered him not to carry me on board any more. This 
 infolent meffage much furprifed me, yet J gave him no 
 anfwer to ft, but went directly and acquainted the fuper- 
 cargo, entreating kirn to go on board, and, by acquainting 
 the Captain with it, prevent the mutiny which I perceived 
 would happen. But before I had fpuke this, the matter 
 was effected on board; for no focner was he gone off in 
 the boat, but the boatfwain, gunner, carpenter, and all the 
 inferior officers, came to the quarter-deck, defiring to fpeak 
 with the Captain; and there the boatfwain made a long 
 
 
 harangue, exclaiming againft me, as before-mentioned, that 
 if I had not gone on more peaceably for my own diverfion, 
 they, by violence, would have compelled me, for their fa « 
 tisfaction : that as they had (hipped with the Captain, fo 
 they would faithfully ferve him; but if I did not quit the 
 fhip, or the Captain oblige me to it, they would leave the 
 fhip immediately : hereupon, turning his face about, by 
 way of fignal, they all cried out, <f ONE and ALL 1 ONE 
 and ALL!" 
 
 You may be fure, that though my nephew was a man of 
 great courage, yet he could not but be furprifed at their 
 iudden and unexpected behaviour ; and though he talked 
 ftoutly to them, and afterwards expoftulated with them, 
 that in common juftice to me, who was a considerable own- 
 er in the (hip, they could not turn me, as it were, out of my 
 own houfe, which might bring their lives in danger fhould 
 they ever be taken in England ; nay, though h€ invited the 
 boatfwain on fhore to accommodate matters with me, yet 
 all this, 1 fay, fignified nothing ; they would have nothing to 
 do with me; and they were refolved to go on fliore if f 
 came on board. ""We!!," faid my nephew, " if you are 
 fo refolved, permit me to talk with him, and then I have 
 dene ;" and fo he came to me, giving me an account of their 
 refolution, how one and all defigned. to forfake the (hip 
 when i came on board, for which he was mightily concern- 
 ed. u l am glad to fee you, nephew," faid 1, *' and rejoice 
 it is no worfe, fince they have not rebelled againft you ; 
 I only defire you to fend my necefTary things on fhore, 
 with a fufficient fum of money, and I will find my way to 
 England as well as I can." Though this grieved my ne- 
 phew to the heart, yet there was no remedy but compliance: 
 in fhort, all my necefTaries were lent to me, and fo this 
 matter was over in a few hours. 
 
 I think I was now near a thoufand leagues farther off 
 England by fea, than at my little kingdom, except this dif- 
 ference, that I might travel by land over the Great Mogul's 
 country to Surat, from thence to Baflbra, by fea up the 
 Peifi*n Gulph, then take the way of the caravans over the 
 Arabian Defert to Aleppo ard Scanderoon, there take (hip- 
 ping to Italy, and fo travel by land into Fiance, and from 
 thence acrois the fea to England, 
 
 My nephew left me two perfons to attend me ; one of 
 them was his fervant, and the other clerk to the purfer

 who engaged to be mine. I took lodgings in an EngliHi 
 woman's houfe, where feveral French, oneEnglifh, and two 
 Italian merchants refided. The handfome entertainment 
 I met with here, occafioned me to flay nine months, con- 
 fidering what courle I mould take. Some Englifh goods 
 I had with me of great value, befides a thoufand pieces of 
 eight, a-nd a lerter for more, if there was fuch necefiity.— 
 Tne goods I fooii difpdfed of to advantage, and bought here 
 feveral good diamonds, which I could eafily carry about 
 with me. One morning the Englilh merchant came to me, 
 as being very intimate together, "Countryman," faid he, 
 "I have a project to communicate to you, which I hope 
 will fuit to both ouradvantage. To be (hort, Sir, we are 
 both in a remote part of the world from our country ; but 
 y^t in a place where men of bMnefs may get a great deal 
 of money. Now, if you will put a thoufand pounds to my 
 thoufand pounds, we will hire a (hip to our fatisfaction ; 
 you (hall be Captain, I will be merchant ; and we'll go a 
 trading voyage to China, for why mould we lie ftill like 
 drones, while the whole world is in continual motion." 
 
 This propofal foon got my confent, being very agreeable 
 to my rambling genius ; and the more fo, becaufe I looked 
 upon my countryman to be a very iincere p?rion; it re- 
 quired fome time before we could get a vefTo 1 to our mind, 
 and failors to man it accordingly ; at length we bought a 
 fhip, and got an Englifh mate, boatfwain, and gunner, a 
 Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese foremaft-men ; and, 
 for want of others, made fhift with Indian feamen. We firft 
 failed to Achin, in the ifland of Sumatra, and thence to Siam, 
 where we bartered our wares for fome arrack and opium, 
 the laft of which bore a great price among the Chinefe; in 
 a word, we went up to Sufkan, making a very great voyage^ 
 and, after eight months time, I returned to Bengal, very well 
 fatisiied with this adventure, having not only got a fufficient 
 quantity of money, butaninfightof getting a great deal more. 
 
 The next voyage my friend propofed to me, was to go 
 among the Spice iflands, and bring home a load of cloves 
 from the Manillas, or thereabouts ; iflands belonging part- 
 ly to Spain, but where the Dutch trade very ccnfiderably. 
 We were not long in preparing for this voyage, which we 
 made no Jefs fuccefsful than the laft, touching at Borneo* 
 and feveral other places which . I do not perfectly remem- 
 ber, and returned home in about five months time. We 
 
 
 foon fold our fpices, which we c chiefly cloves and feme 
 nutmegs, to the Periian merchants, who carried them away 
 for the Gulph ; and, in mort, makingiive to one advantage, 
 we were loaded with money. 
 
 Not long after my friend and Triad made up our accounts, 
 to our ent re fatisfaction; there came in a Dutch coailer 
 from Batavia, of about two hundred tons, The crew of 
 this verTe! pretended themfelves fa fickly, that there were 
 not hands lufficient to undertake a voyage ; and the Captain 
 having given out thjtthe intended t, go to Europe, public 
 notice was given tnat ths imp was to be fold, Nj fooner 
 did this come to cur ears but we bought tht fhip, paid the 
 mader, and took* poffefiibn. We would alfo have very 
 willingly entertained fonie of the men; but they having 
 received their (hare of booty^ were not to be found, being 
 altogether fid to Agra, the great city of t'ne Mogul's refi- 
 dence: and from thence went to travel to Sura:, and fa by 
 the tea to the Perfian Gulph. And indeed they had reafon 
 to fiy in this manner ; for the truth of it was, the pretended 
 Captain was the gunner only, and not the commander; 
 that having been on a trading voyage, they w r ere attacked 
 on the more by the Malayans, who killed three men and 
 tne Captain ; aften whofe death the other eleven men run 
 &way with the (hip to the Bay of Bengal, and left the mate 
 and five men more on more; but of this affair we flu II 
 have occafion to fpeak more at length hereafter. 
 
 However they came by the fhip, we thought we bought 
 it honeftiy : neither did we fufpect any thing of the matter, 
 when the man fhowed us a bill of faie for the ihip (undoubt-. 
 edly forged) to one ftmanuel Cloiterfhoven, which name he 
 went by. And (o^ without any more to do, we picked up 
 fome Dutch and Englifh learnon, refolving f.«r another voy- 
 age.for cloves among the Phihpp : ne and Molucca rflands : 
 in Ihort, we continued thus five or fix years, trading from 
 port to port with extraordinary fuccefs. In the fe^enth 
 year, we undercook a voyage to China, designing to touch 
 at Siam, and buy fome rice by the way. Jo this voyage 
 contrary winds beat us up and down for a confidcrabie time 
 among the iflands in the Straits of Molucca. No fooner 
 Were we clear of thofe rugged feas, but we perceived 
 our fhip had fprung a leak, which obliged us to put rn ! o the 
 river Cambodia^ which lies northward of the Gulph, and 
 goes up to Siam.

 One day, as I was on fhore refreshing myfelf, there 
 came to me an Englimrna-n, who was a gunner's mate on 
 board an Eogbfii Baft-India (hip., riding up the river near 
 the city of Cambodia : u Sir/' laid he, " you may wonder 
 at my bufinefs, having never feen me in your life; but tho* 
 I am a ftranger I have fomething to tell ycu ihat very near- 
 ly concerns you; and indeed it is the imminent danger you 
 are 'in has moved me to give you this timely notice." — 
 **' Danger !? faid I, « what danger? I know of none, ex- 
 cept my fhip being leaky, f ,r which I defign to have her 
 jr-n- aground to-morrow morning. " "I hope you will be 
 better employed when you (hall hear what I have to fay to 
 you. You know the town of Cambodia is about fifteen 
 iciigxss up this river; about three ha^ues on this fide of it, 
 there lie two Dutch and three EngliuYlhips. And wculd 
 you venture here without conftcering what ftrength you 
 have to engage them ?" I knew not what he meant by this 
 difcourfe, and turning ihort upon him, ki Sir," faid I, * f I 
 know no reafon i have to be afraid either of fny Dutch or 
 Kr>gli;h finp^. I am .no interloper, and what bufinefs -have 
 inzy with -me ? ?? '} Wei!, Sir," (aid the man, " if you do 
 think yourfeif feeure, all as I can fay, you mult take your 
 char.ce; however, I am very ferry you are fo deaf to good 
 advice ; but I allure you, if you do not put to fea immedi- 
 ately, ycu will be attacked by five long boats full of men, 
 hanged yourfeif for a p rate, if you are taken, and the par- 
 ticulars examined afterwards. I thoughr, Sir/' added he, 
 ** 1 might have met a better reception for fuch a Angu- 
 lar piece of &rvice. ,? " Sir," faid 1, <c I never was un- 
 grateful to any man ; but p. ay explain yourfeif, and I'll go 
 on board this minute, whether the leak be (topped or no.*' 
 <f Why, Sir," faid he, " to be ihort, becaufe time is precious, 
 the matter is this: You know well enough that you was 
 with the fhip at Sumatra, when your Captain was murdered 
 by the Malayans, with three of his failors ; and that either  
 you, or fome who were on board you, ran away with the 
 fh : p, and are fince turned pira es at fea. Now, Sir, this 
 is the furn of what I have to fay; and I can poficively afTure 
 you, that if ycu are taken, you will be executed without 
 much ceremony, for undoubtedly you cannot but be fen- 
 fibie what little law merchant (hips mow to pirates, when- 
 ever they fall into their hands/' 
 
 «< Sir," faid I, ;s I thank you for your kind information ; 
 
 
 and though I .am fare no man could come more honeftly 
 by the ftnp than I have done, yet knowing their enterprize, 
 and bein^ fatisfied of your h^neft intention, I'll be upon my 
 defence/*' « Pr'ythee, Sir," faid the man, " don't talk of 
 being upon Jrcur defence, the belt th*u you can make is to 
 be out of danger ; ard, therefore, if you have any regard for 
 your life, and the lives of your men, take the advantage, 
 without fail, of putting out to lea at high-water: by which 
 mean*, as you have a v. hole tide before you, you will be gotfe 
 too far out of their reach before they ckn come down.'-' 
 
 " I am mightily well fatisfred," faid I, " in this particular ; 
 and for yfcpr kincnefs', which merits my great efteem, pray, 
 Sir, what amends mall 1 make you?" He replied, " I'jcnow 
 n?t what amends >ou are willing to make, becaufe yfii 
 may have fame doubts of its certainty-: but, to convince 
 you or the mur? of what I fay, 1 have one oiler to rmk* c<> 
 you, On board one of the ~En.?ii!h'fiiip;, I have ni:eteai 
 fcnemth's pay due to me, and this Dutch man that is w.th me, 
 has leven months pay dne to him, which if you will make 
 good to us, we will go along wih you. if you fhall find 
 that there is nothing in what we have faid, then we fhall 
 defire nothing; but when you are convinced, that we have 
 fav^d the fhip, your life, and the lives of the men, we fhall 
 leave the whole to your generofity. 
 
 So reafonahle did this every way appear, that I immedi- 
 ately confented, and we went direclly on board. As foon 
 jas we came on board, my partner calls joyfully out, "That 
 they had flopped the leak!" i( Weil, thank God," faid I, 
 u but pray let us weigh anchor forthwith. — " Weigh 1" 
 faid he, ie what is the meaning of this hurry r" <e Pray affc 
 no queftiors," faid I y *• but all hands to work, without 
 lofing a moment's time." Upon which, in great furprife, 
 the Captain was called, who immediately ordered the anchor 
 to be got up; and though the tide was not quite down, 
 yet being aflifted with a little land breeze, we flood to fea. 
 
 I then called my partner into the cabin, and related the 
 flory at large, which was confirmed and more amplified by 
 the two men I had brought on board. Scarce had we 
 finifhed our difcourle upon this head, but a fai lor came to 
 the cabin door, with a meffage from the Captain, that wc 
 were chafed by five Hoops full of armed men. " Very 
 well," faid I, u it is plain now there is fomething in it. J '— • 
 And fo, going upon deck, I told all the men there was a 
 
 
 defign for fe'zing the fhip, and of executing us for pirates; 
 and afked them whether they would faithfully (land by us> 
 and by one another ?'• To which they unanirr.cufly replied* 
 #t That they would fight to their laft drop of blood." I 
 then afked the Cap ain, which way he thought bed for us 
 to manage the battle? €i Sir, 5 ' faid he, •« the only method 
 is to keep them off with our great fly.?t as long as we are 
 able, and then have recourfe to our froall arms ; and when 
 both thefe fail u?, then retire to clofe quarters, when per- 
 haps the enemy, wanting materials, can neither break open 
 our buik-heads, nor net in upon us." Mean-time the gun- 
 ner was ordered to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out 
 of the fteerage, and fo load tnem with mufket-bullets and 
 imall pieces of old iron; and the deck being cleared, we 
 prepared for the engagement, Kill, however, keeping out 
 at tea. The boats followed us with all the fail they could 
 make, and we could perceive the two forenroft were Eng- 
 lilh, which outfailed the reft by two leagues, and which we 
 ion rid would come up with us : hereupon, we fired a gun 
 without ball, intimating that they fliould bring to, and we 
 put out a flag of truce, as a figral for parley ; but rinding 
 them crowding after us, till they came within (hot, we took 
 in our white, and hanging out the red flag, immediately 
 fired at them with bail : we then called to them with a 
 fpeaking tmmpet, bidding them at their peril keep off. 
 
 But all this fignified nothing ; for depending upon the 
 flrength that fallowed them, they were refoiutely bent for 
 inifchief: hereupon I o/d^red them to bring the (hip to, by 
 which means, they lying upon our broadfide, we let fly at 
 them at once, ore of whom carried away the Hem of the 
 hindermod boat, and obliged them not oni? to take down 
 their JSaiL but made them a 1 run to the head of the boat, to 
 keep them from finking, and fo ihe lay by, having enough 
 of it. In the mean time, we preparer to welcome the fore- 
 rcoft boat in the fa-me manner. While we were doing this, 
 one of the three hindermefi boats came up to the relief of 
 that which was difablcd, and topk the men out of her. We 
 again called to parley with them; but, ini-ead of at anfwer, 
 one of the boats came clofe under our fLrn ; whereupon 
 our gunner let fly his two chafe guns, but miffing, '.he men 
 in tre boat ihouted, and waving their caps, ca'zVii on with 
 greater, fury. To repair this feeming difcrace, ihe gunner 
 ioon got ready, and ftrirg a fecond time, did a great deal of 
 
 
 mifchief among the enemy. We waved again, and bring, 
 ing our quarter to bear up->n them, fired three guns more, 
 xynpt} we found the boa't a finking, and feveral men already 
 in the fsa ; hereupon, manning our pinnace, I gave orders 
 to fave as many as they could, and inftantly to come on 
 board, becaufe the reft of their boats were approaching : 
 accordingly they did fb, and took up three of them, one of 
 whom was almoft paft recovery ; and then crowding all the 
 fail we could, after our men came on board, we flood out 
 farther to fea, (o that the other three boats gave ever the 
 chafe, when they came up to the h>ft two. Thus delivered 
 from imminent danger, we changed our courfe to the eaft- 
 ward, quite out of the courfe of all European (hips. 
 
 Being now at fea, and inquiring more particularly of the 
 two feamen, the meaning ot all this, the Dutchman at once 
 Jet us into the fecret. He told us rhat the fellow who iold 
 us the fhip was an arrant thief, who had rim away with her; 
 that the captain was treacoeroufly murdered on the coaifc 
 of Molucca by the natives there, with three of his men ; 
 that he, »he Dutchman, and four more, being obliged to 
 have recourfe to the woods for the; ir fafety, at length elcaped 
 by means of a Dutch ihip., in its way to China, whxh had 
 fent their boat on fhore ior freih water; that, afur this, 
 he went to Batavia; there two of the feamen belonging to 
 the ihip (who had defeated the reft in their travels) arrived, 
 &nd there gave an account that the fellow who ran -away 
 with the fhip had iold her at Bengal to a fet of pirates, who 
 went a cruifmg, and had already taken one Englifhand two 
 Dutch (hips richly laden. 
 
 Now, though this was absolutely faife, my partner truly 
 faid, that our deliverance was to be efteerned fo much the 
 more, by reafon, had we fallen into ihtlr hands, we could 
 have expe&eci nothing from them but immediate death, 
 confidenng cur accufers wculd have been our judges; and, 
 therefore, his op.nicn was to return directly to Bengal, 
 where, being knowri^ we could prove how hontfijy we cime 
 by the lhrp, or whom we bought her, and the like, and 
 where we were iure of fome juiice ; at lead would not be 
 hanged firft and judged afterwards.- 1 wa^ at lull of n.y 
 partners opinion, but when I had more ferioully consider- 
 ed il the matter, I told him we ran a great hazard in at- 
 tempting to jeturn, being en the wrong fid? of tne Straits 
 
 K5 
 
 
 of Molucca, and that, if, upon alarm given, we mould be 
 taken by the Dutch at Batavia, or Englifh clfewhere, our 
 running away would be a fufficient evidence to condemn us. 
 This danger indeed flartled not only my partner, but like- 
 wife all the (hip's company; fo we changed our former re- 
 solution, and refolved to go to the coaft of Tonquin, and 
 fo to that of China, where purfuing our firft defign as to 
 trade, we might likcwife have an opportunity to difpofe of 
 the (hip i'ome way or other, and to return to Bengal, in any 
 country veflel we could procure. This being agreed tc, 
 we fieexed away N. N. E. about 50 leagues off the ufual 
 ccurfe to the eaft, which put us to fome inconvenience*. 
 As the wind blew fleadily againft us, our voyage became 
 more tedious, and we began to be afraid of want of provi- 
 Xions; and what was itill worfe, we apprehended, that as 
 tfcofe fhips, from whofe boats we had efcaped, were bound 
 to China, they might get before us, and have given frefh 
 information, which might create another vigorous purfuit. 
 indeed I could not help being grieved, when I confidered 
 lhat 1, who had never wronged or defrauded any perfon in 
 my life, was now purfued like a common thief, and, if taken, 
 to run the greateit danger of being executed as fuch ; and, 
 though innocent, I found myfelf under the neceflity of fly- 
 ing for my fafety, and thereby cfcape being brought to 
 ihame, of which I was even more afraid than of death itfelf. 
 It was eafy to read my deje&ion in my countenance. My 
 mind was oppreffed, like thofe unhappy, innocent perfons, 
 who being overpowered by blafphemous and perjured evi- 
 dences, wickedly refolved r.o take away their lives, or ruin 
 ihei* reputation, have no other recourfe in this world to 
 cafe their forrow, but fi^hs, payers, and tears. My partner 
 feeing me fo concerneci/encouraged me as well as he could; 
 and after defcribing to me the feverai ports of that coaft, 
 he told me, hewoud either pot me in on the coaft of Cochin- 
 Chins, or e)fe in the Bay of T quin, from wrience we might 
 go to Macao, a town -nee poffcfftcTby the Portuguefe, and 
 where Mil) many European families refided. 
 
 To this place we fleered, and early next morning came 
 3n fight of tue ccaft; but thought it advifab'Ie to put into 
 a fmall river where we coud, eit er overland, or bv the 
 (hip's pinnace, know what veffels were in any ports there- 
 abouts. This happy ftep proved our deliverance : f. r, next 
 morning, there came to the Bay of Toncjuin two Butch 
 
 
 fhips, and a third without any colours; and in the evening 
 two Engiifh fhips fleered the fame courfe. The river 
 where we were was but fmall, and run but a few leagues up 
 the country northward ; the country was wild and barbarous, 
 ard the people thieves, having ro correspondence with any 
 other nation,, dealing only in fifh, oil, and fuch grofs com- 
 modities ; ard one barbarous cuilom they ftil] retained, that 
 when any veflel was unhappily ihipwrecked upon their 
 coafl, they make the men prif ners or fiaves ; fo that now 
 we might fairly fay we. were furrounded by enemies both by 
 fea and land. 
 
 As ;he fhip had been leaky, we tcok the opportunity, in 
 this place, to fearch her, and to Hop up the places which 
 let in the water. We accordingly lightened her, and bring- 
 ing our puns and oiher moveable things to one fide, we eU 
 fayed to brtng her down, that we might come to her bot- 
 tom ; but, upon fecond confederation, we did not think it 
 fafe'tolet her lie" on dry ground, neither, indeed, was the 
 place convenient for it. The inhabitants, not ufed to fuch 
 a fight as to fee a fhip lis down or one fide, and heel in to- 
 wards the fhore, and noi perceiving the men who were at 
 work on her bottom, with ftages and boats on *rte off- fide, . 
 presently imagined the fhip had been call away, and lay 
 faft on the ground. Agreeable, to this fuppcfition, they 
 furrounded us with ten or twelve large boats, with a refo- 
 iution, undoubtedly, to p!unoer the ilup, and carry away 
 thofe they found alive for fbves to their king. But when 
 they perceived cur men hard at w>rk on the (hip's bottom 
 and fide, warning, graving, and flopping her, it filled ihera 
 all with fuch furprife, trut they ftood gazing as though they 
 were confounded. Nor could we imagine what toeir de-~ 
 fign was ; however, for fear of danger, we handed down 
 arms and ammuniion to thofe at work, in order to defend 
 themfelves ; and, indeed, this precaution was abfoiutely 
 necefTary ; f ' r, in a quarter of an nour after, the natives, 
 concluding it was reahy a fnip wreck, and tnat we were fa- 
 ving our lives and goods, which tuey-th ught belonged to 
 thvin, came down upon our mon, as though ic had been in 
 line of bat;!e. We Uy at prefent bui in a v-ry unrit pofture 
 to right ; a^d before the iia.^-s couid be *ot do^n, 'o; the 
 roeu in the boat c m- on board as ihey were ordered, tne 
 Cocnin-Chirefe ere upo 1 them, and two of their boats 
 bearding our long-boat, they began to lay hold of our meii 
 
 K(i 
 
 
 as prifoners. The fir ft they feized was a flout English- 
 iailor, who never fired his mufket, like a fool as I imagined, 
 but laid it down in the boat : but he knew what he was 
 doing; for, by main force, he dragged the Pagan out of (he 
 boat into ours by the two ears, end knocked his brains out 
 sgaini! the boat's gunnel; a Dutchman that was next, him 
 fnatched up the mufket, and knocked down Rve more with 
 the butt-end of it; however, this was do ; ng very little to 
 their number ; but a ftrange unexpected accident, which 
 rather merits laughter than any thing eife, gave our men a 
 complete victory over them. 
 
 It feems the carpenter, who was preparing to gr^ve the 
 outfide of the fhip, ss well as to pay the feams, where he 
 caulked to flop the leaks, had gotten two kettles juft let 
 down in the boat, one filled with boiling pitch, and the 
 other with rutin, tallow, oil, and fuch' ftuff as the'fliip- 
 wrights ufe ; the carpenter's man had a great iron ladle 
 with which he ufed to fupply the workmen with hot fluff", 
 and as two of the enemies entered the boat where the fel-' 
 .low fkod, he faluted them with a full ladle of the hot boil- 
 ing liquor, which, the poor creatures being half naked, made 
 them roar out, and jump imd the fea. i€ Wei; done, Jack," 
 fays the caipenter, "give them the other dofe :" and fo 
 flepping forward himfelf, takes a mop, and dipping it into 
 the pitch-pot, he and his man fo plentifully flung it among 
 them, as that none efcaped being fcalded; upon which they 
 all made the bed of their way, crying and howling in fuch 
 a frightful manner,' that, in all my adventures, I never heavd 
 the like. And, indeed, never was I better pleated with 
 any conqueft than 1 was with this, there being fo little 
 bloodCbed, and having an averfipn tb killing fuch favage 
 wretches, (more than was neceffary,) as knowing they cam* 
 ©n errands, which their Jaws and cuftoms made them think 
 were Jutland equitable. By this time all things being in 
 order, and the fhip fwimming, they found their miilake, fo 
 they did npt venture a fecond attack. Thus ended our 
 merry fight, and, having got rice, bread, roots, and hxteen 
 good hogs tn board the day before, we fet fail, not daring 
 to go if to the bay of Tonquin but fleered N. E. toward 
 the ifland of Fomofa, or as though we would go to the 
 Manilla?- or Philippine iflands, for feai' of meeting with any; 
 European Ihips; when we anchored at the ifle of Formofa, 
 the inhabitants not only courteoufiy fupplied us with pro- 
 
 
 vifions and frefh water, but dealt very fairly and honeftly 
 with us in their bargains and agreements. From this place 
 we fleered north, keeping ftill off the coaft of China, till 
 we were beyond all its ports where European fhips ufualty 
 come; and, at length, being come to the latitude of thirty 
 degrees, we refolved to put into the firft trading port we 
 fhould come at; and ftandirg for the ihore, a boat came off 
 two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot on board, 
 who offered his fervice; we very gladly accepted him, and 
 fent the boat back again. And now, jpaving the old man 
 on board, 1 talked to him of going to Nanquin, the moil 
 northward part of the coaft of China. 6< What will you do 
 there } v faid he, fmiling. 1 told him we would fell our 
 cargo, and purchafe calicoes, raw and wrought filks, tea, 
 •&c. and fo return the fame way back. " O/' laid he, " you 
 had better put in at Macao, where you may buy China wares 
 as cheap as at Nanquin, *and fell your opium at a greater 
 advance/' *k Sot," faid I, si we are gentlemen, as well as 
 merchants, and defign to fee the great city of Pekin, and 
 the magnificent court of the monarch of China. " «' Why, 
 then," laid he, *.* you mould go to Ning^po, where there is 
 a navigable river that goes through the heart of that vaft 
 empire, two hundred and feventy leagues from the tea, 
 which crcifes all the rivers, paiTes confiderable hills, by the 
 help of the fluices and gates, and goes even up to the city of 
 Pekin, You may go to Nanquin, if ycu pleafe, and travel to 
 Pekin, and there is a Dutch (hip juft before bound that way/* 
 At the name of a Duxh or Englifh tliip, 1 was {truck with 
 confuiion; they being as great a terror to me in this veiTel, 
 as an Algerine man of war is to them in the Mediterranean. 
 The old man finding me troubled, if Sir," faid he," I hope 
 the Dutch are not now at war with your nation." <4 No/' 
 faid I, " but God knowt: what liberty they may take when 
 out of the reach of ihe law." " Why," fays he, i( what occa- 
 ficn is there tor peaceable merchants to fear ? For, believe 
 me, they never meddle with any but PIRATES^." 
 
 At the mentioning the word Pirates* my countenance 
 turned to that of fcarlet; nor was it poiiible for tsfc ro con- 
 ceal u from the old pilot; who taking notice o? it, * Sir/ 1 
 faid he, " take what courfe you ple.fe, Til cic you all he 
 fervice I can." " Seignior," (aid ju "lam a little con- 
 cerned at your mentioning piratej ; i hope tii-ere are s o..e 
 fuch in thefe feas> becaufe you fee in what weak 'condition 
 
 
 we are to defend ourfelves." M O, Sir," faid he, ei if that*a 
 all, don't be concerned, ; I don't remember one in thefe feas . 
 thefe fifteen years, except about a month ago one was feen in 
 the bay of Siam, but he is gone to the fouthward; neither was 
 ihe built for a privateer, but was run away with by a repro- 
 bate Captain, and fome of his men, the right Captain having 
 been murdered by the Malayans/' 
 
 «' What!" faid I, (as though ignorant of what had hap- 
 pened) " did they kill the Captain \" ",No," faid he, "it is 
 generally thought the Malayans murdered him ; but perhaps 
 they might procure them to do it, and therefore they juftly 
 deferve hanging. The rogues were lately difcovered in 
 the Bay of Siam, in the river of Cambodia, by fi,me Dutch- 
 men who belonged to the fhip, and had much ado to efcape 
 the five boats that purfued them, but they have folemnly 
 fworn to give no quarter to the Captain or the feamen, but 
 hang them every one up at the yard-arm, witnout any fir-- 
 inal bufinefs of bringing them to a court of judicature. f 
 
 Being fenfible that, having the old man on board, he 
 was incapable of doing me any mifchief, u Well, Seignior,'* 
 faid 1, - •' it is for this very reafon I would have you carry 
 us up to Nanquin, where neither Engiifh nor Dutch (hips 
 come; and 1 mud tell you, their Captains are a parcel of 
 rafh, proud, infolcnt rafcals, that neither know what belongs 
 to juitice, v. or how to behave themfelves as the laws of God 
 or nature direft; fellows that would prove murderers to> 
 punilh robbers, and take upon ?hem to jucige innocent men 
 to death, without any proof to prove them guilty; but per- 
 haps J may live to call them to account for it, in a place 
 where they may be taught how juftice is to be executed." 
 And fo I told him all the itory of buying the fhip, and how 
 we were favtd by the means of two men : that the murder 
 of the Capiain by the Malayans, as alfo the running away 
 wuh the *hip, loelieved to be true ; but that we. who bought 
 it, were turned pirates, was a mere fiction, to cover their 
 cowardice and foolilh behaviour, when they attacked us* 
 and the blood of tftofe men we killed in our jwn juft defence 
 lay at their door, who were fent to attack us by furprsfe." 
 «' S»r," faid the old man amazed, " you nave taken the 
 right courfe to fleer to the nort-i, and if 1 might advife 
 you, I would have » ou fell yonr fhnp in China, and buy or 
 build another in tnai country; and I'll procure people to 
 buy the one, and fell tne other/' u Well, but Seignior,'* 
 
 
 faid I, u if I fell the (hip in this manner, I may bring fome 
 innocent perfons into the fame dangers I have gone through, 
 perhaps worfe than even death itfelf : whereby I fhoujd be as 
 guilty of their murder as their villanous executioners." — 
 " That need not trouble you," fays the old man, is I'll find 
 a way to prevent that ; for thefe commanders, you talk of, 
 I know very well, and will inform them rightly of the mat- 
 ter as you have related, and am perfuaded they will not 
 only believe me, but act more cautioufly for the future."— 
 " And will you deliver one meflage from me to them?" 
 " Yes," faid he, u if you will give it under your hand, that 
 I may prove it is not of my own production." Hereupon 
 I wrote a large account of their attacking me in their long- 
 boat, the pretended reafon and unjuft defign of it ; that 
 they had done what they might be auramed of, and could 
 not anfwer for at any tribunal in England. But this letter 
 was writ in vain. Providence ordered things another way. 
 We failed directly for Nanquin, and in about thirteen days 
 fail came to an anchor at the fouth-weft point of the great 
 golf of that place, where we learned, that two Dutch 
 mips were gone the length before us, and that we mould 
 certainly fall into their hands. We were all at a great lofs 
 in this exigency, and would very gladly have been on more 
 almoft any where; but our old pilot told me that if I 
 would fail to the fouthward about two and forty leagues, 
 there was a little port called Quinchang, where no Euro- 
 pean (hips ever came, and where we might confider what 
 was further to be done. Accordingly we weighed anchor 
 the next day, calling only twice on more by the way to 
 get frelh water. The country people very courteoufly 
 fold us roots, tea, rice, fowls, and uther provifions. After 
 live days fail we came to the port, and landed with unfpeak- 
 able joy. We ref Ived to difpote of ourfe'ves and effects 
 in any other way poflible, than enter on board that ill-fated 
 veffel more ; for no ftate can be more miferable than a 
 continued fear, which is a life of deatft, a confounder of 
 cur understandings, that fets the imagination at work to 
 form a choufand frightful things thac may never happen. 
 And we fcarce flept one "ight, without dreaming of halters, 
 yard-arm, or gibbet s, cf fighting, being taken, and being 
 killed; nay fo violent were our apprehenfions, that we 
 would bruife our hands and heads againlr. the (ides of the 
 cabin as though actually engaged. The ltory of the Dutch 
 
 232 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 
 
 cruelty at Amboyna, often came into our thoughts when 
 awr ke ; and, for my part, I thought my condition very 
 hard, that after fo many difficulties and fuch fignal deliver- 
 ances, I fhould be hanged in my old age, though innocent 
 af any crime that deferved fuch punifnment; but then re- 
 lipion would feem to reprefent to me, as though the voice 
 of it had faid, confider, O man ! what fins you have been 
 formerly guilty of; which now thou art called to an account 
 for, to expiate with thy bicod ! And as to thy innocence, 
 what art thou more innocent than thy blefted Redeemer 
 Jefus Chrift, who fuffered for thy often ces, and to whole 
 providence you ought to fubmir, let what will happen ? 
 After this, natural courage would infpire me to reftfi to the 
 la ft drop of blood, and fopner die than fufter myfelf to be 
 taken by boorilh rafcally Dutchmen, who had arts to torment 
 beyond death itfelf. 
 
 But new, thank kind Heaven, being am ore, our old pilot 
 procured us a lodging and warehouse for our goods ; it 
 was a little hir. with a Jarge warehouse joining to it, all 
 built with canes, and palifadoed round with large ores, to 
 keep out pilfering thieves, which are very numerous in that 
 country. The magiura es allowed us a little guard during 
 the night, and we employed a centinel with a kind of hal- 
 bert for threepence a cay. The fair, or mart, we found 
 had been over for fome time; however, there remained in 
 the rive:r-f<>ur junks and two J;ipan fhips, the mere ha .its of 
 the latter .being on Ihore. In the fir ft place, our old pilot 
 brought us acquainted with the milHonary Roman prielts, 
 whow.ee converting the people to Chriftianit} ~: two of 
 thern were raierved, rigid, and auftere& applying themfdves 
 to the work they came about with great carr^ilnefs ; but 
 the third, who was a Frenchman, caied Father Simeon, was 
 of a feet converfation, not feemingly {o ferrous and grave, 
 yet no worfe Chriftian than tne other two, one of whom 
 was a Portuguefe, and the other a (Qcmoefe. ther imeon, 
 it ieems, was appointed to go to Pekin, the royal f^ax of 
 the Emperor of the Chinefe; and he only waitea for ano- 
 ther prieft, who was ordered from Macao to accompany 
 him. W.p never met together, but he was prompting me 
 io accompany him in that jojiney : u Sir/' fajd ne, " I 
 will ihow you the glorious things , f this mighty empire, 
 and a city, the riy of Pekin, far exceeding Lond n ; :& 
 Pars, put them both together, v One day in particular, be- 
 
 
 ing at dinner with him, I mowed fome inclination to go ; 
 which made him prefs the more upon me and ray partner, 
 to gain our perfedl coafent. " But, Father Simeon/' faid 
 my partner, x< what fatisfaction cm you have in our com- 
 pany, whom you efteem as heretics, a;d confequently objects 
 not worthy your regard ?' %< Q," faid he, " yo<xrnay be as 
 good Catholics in time as. thofe I hope to convert to our 
 religion." ", And (q>" faid I, " we Jhall have your preach- 
 ing to us all the way, inftead of pleafing us with, a defcrip^ 
 tion of the country." €i Sir/', faid he, •* however our reK- 
 gion may be vilified by fome people, it is very ceruin it 
 neither divefts us of good manners or Chriftian charky ; and 
 as we are gentlemen, as fuch we may convene together, 
 without making one another uneafy." 
 
 Bat we (hall leave him awhile, to confide? our (hip and 
 the merchandise which we had to difpofe of.. There was 
 but very lictle trade in the place where we were ; and I 
 was once refolved to .venture to fail to the river KiJ&m, and 
 fo to the City of Nanquin ; but Providence ordered it other- 
 wife, fey oar old pilot's bringing a Japan merchant i;o us, to 
 fee what goods we had. He immediately bought our opium* 
 for which he gave us a very good price in gold by weight, 
 fome wedges of which were about ten or eleven ounces. 
 It came into my head that perhaps he might buy the (hip 
 too; and i ordered his interpreter to propofe it to him.-— 
 He faid nothing then, but fhrugged up his moulders ; yet 
 in a few days after he came, accompanied by a miffionary 
 prieit, who was his interpreter, with this propofal, " That 
 as he had bought a .great quantity of our goods, he had not 
 money enough to purchafe our lhip j but if I pleafed he 
 would hire her, with all .my men, to go to japan, and from 
 thence with another loading fo the Philippine iilands, the 
 freight of which he would very willingly pay to us before; 
 avid at their return to J^pan, would buy the Hup." Upon 
 this we aiked the Capiain and his men, if they were willing 
 to go to Japan ; to wmen they unanimoufiy agreed. While 
 this was in agitation, the young man, my nephew left to 
 attend me, told me, 4t That as I did not e*re to accept this 
 proipecl: of advantage, he would manage it for me as I 
 pleafed, and render me a faithful account of his fuccefs, 
 which would b« wholly mine." Indeed I was very unwil- 
 ling to part with htmj but confidering it might be for the 
 
 
 young man's good, I difcourfed with my partner about it, 
 who, of his own gererofity, gave him his fhare of theveffel, 
 fo that I could do no otberwife than give him mire : but, 
 however, we let him have buc the proper half of it, and 
 preferved a pdwer, that when we met in England, if he 
 had obtained fuccefs, he fliould account to us for one-half of 
 the profits of the (hip's freight, and the other fhould be his 
 own. Thus having ta-ken a writing under his hand, away 
 he failed to Japan, where the merchant dealt very honeftly 
 by him, got him a licenfe to come on (bore, fent him loaded 
 to the Philippines with a Japanefe lu per car go, from whence 
 he came back again loaded with European goods, cloves, and 
 other fpices. By this voyage he cleared a confiderabler 
 fum of money, which determined him not to fell his fhip, 
 but to trade en his cwn account ; fo he returned to the Ma- 
 nillas, where, fettisrg acquaintance, he made his (hip free, 
 was fcredby the governor privately to go to Aeapulco in 
 Amertca, en the Mexican coaft, with a licenfe to travel to 
 the great city cf Mexico. This traffic turned out greatly to 
 account and my friend finding means to get to Jamaica, re- 
 turned nine years after exceedingly rich into England. 
 
 In parting with the (hip, it comes in courie to confider 
 cf thofe men who had faved our lives when in the river of 
 Cambcd'a ; and though, by the way, they were a couple of 
 rogues, who thought to turn pirates themfelves, yet we 
 paid them what they had before demanded, and gave each 
 of them a faial! fum of money, making the Engliihman a 
 gunner, and the Dutchman a boadwain* with which they 
 were very well contented. 
 
 We were now about 1000 leagues farther from home 
 than when at Bengal. All the comfort we could exped: 
 was, that there being another fair to be kept in a month's 
 time, we might not only purchafe all forts of that country's 
 'manufactures, but very pcffibiy find fome Chinefe junks* 
 or veflels from Tonquio, to be fold, which would carry us 
 and our goods wherefoever we pleafed. Upon thefe hop^s* 
 we refolved to continue; and to divert ourfelves, we rook 
 feveral little journeys in the country. About ten days after 
 we parted with our (hip, we travelled to fee the city of 
 Nanquin. The city lies in latitude 30 degrees north of the 
 line: it is regularly built, and the (Ireets are exactly flraight, 
 and crofs one another in direct lines, which fets it out to 
 the greateft advantage. At our return, we found the prieft 
 
was come

 vas come from Macao, that was to accompany father Si- 
 meon to Pekin. That father earneftly folicited me to ac- 
 company him, and I referred him to my partner. In fhon, 
 we both agreed, and prepared accordingly ; and we were 
 fo lucky as to have liberty to travel among the retinue of 
 one of their Mandarines, who is a principal magiftrate, and 
 much reverenced by the people. 
 
 We were five and twenty days travelling through thismifer- 
 able country, infinitely populous, but as indifferently cul- 
 tivated ; and yet their pride is infinitely greater than their 
 poverty, infomuch that the prieils themfeives deride them. 
 As we pafied by the houfe of one of their country gentle* 
 men, two leagues offNanquin, we had the honour, forfooth, 
 to ride with the Chinefe (quire, about two miles. Never 
 was Dun Quixote (o exa&ly imitated ! Never fuch a com- 
 pound cf pomp and poverty feen before! 
 
 His habit, made of calico, was dirty, greafy, and very 
 proper for a Merry Andrew or Scaranouch, with all its 
 tawdry tappings, as hanging fleeves, taflels, &c. though 
 torn and rent in aimoft every part ; his veil underneath it 
 was no iefs dirty, but more greafy, refembling the moft ex- 
 quifite floven, or greafy butcher : his horfe (worfe than Ro- 
 finarvte, or the famous iteed of doughty Hudibras) was a 
 poor ftarved, decrepit thing, that would not fell for thirty 
 /hillings in England ; and yet this piece of worfhipful pomp 
 was attended with ten or twelve flave?, who guarded their 
 mailer to his country feat. We Hopped at a little village 
 for refrefhment ; and when we came by the country feat of 
 this great man, we found him fitting under a tree before his 
 door, eating a mefs of boiled rice, with a great piece of 
 garlic in the middle, and a bag filled with green pepper by 
 him, and another plant like ginger, together with a piece 
 of lean mutton in it: this was his worfhip's repaft: but 
 prayobferve the ftate of the food ! two women (laves brought 
 him his food, which being laid before him, two others ap- 
 peared to perform their refpedive offices; one fed him 
 with a fpoon, while the other (craped off what fell upon his 
 beard and taifety reft, and gave it to a particular favourite 
 to ear. And thus we left the wretch pleafed with the con- 
 ceit of our admiring his magnificence, which rather merited 
 our fcorn and deteftation. 
 
 At length we arrived at the great city of Pckin, accom- 
 panied by two fervants, and the old Portuguefe pilot, whofe 
 
 
 charges we bore, and who ferved us as an interprcterby^ 
 the. way. We had fcarce been a week at Pekin, but he 
 comes laughing to us, '-Ah! Senior Inglife," (aid. he,. 
 u me fomtthing tell you make your heart glad, but make 
 me forry; for you bring me here twenty-five days journey, 
 and now you leave me go back alone; and which way 
 (hall I make my port after, without de fhip, without de 
 horfe, without pecune?" fo he ca led money in his breken 
 Latin. He then informed me, that there was a great ca- 
 ravan of Mufcovite and Polifh merchants in the city, who 
 were preparing to fet out for Mufcavy by land within fix- 
 weeks: and that he was certain we would take, this oppor- 
 tunity, and consequently that he mufl go home by himfelf. 
 Indeed this news infinitely farprifed and, pleafed me. — 
 " Are you certain of this r" faid I. "Yes, Sir," fays he,., 
 "me fure its true." And fo he told me that having met 
 tno'd acquaintance of his, an Armenian, in the ftreet, who 
 was among them, and who hid come From Aftracan, with 
 a defign to go to Tonquin, but for certain reafoas having 
 altered his refolution, he was now-rcfoived to go with the 
 caravan, and to return by the river Wolga to Aftracan. — 
 "Weil, Seignior," faid I "don't be discontented about 
 your returning alone : and if, by this means, I can find a 
 paflage to England, it will be your own fault if you return 
 to Macao at all." And fo confulting with my partner what 
 was bed to be done, be referred it to me as Ipleakd, hav- 
 ing our. affairs fo well fettied at Bengal, that if he could 
 convert the good voyage he had made in China fiiks, 
 wrought or raw, he would be fatisfied to go to England, 
 and fo return to Bengal in the Company's flvps. Thus re- 
 folved, we agreed that if our pilot would go with us, we 
 would bear his charges either to Mofcow, or England ; and 
 to give him in a prefent.the fum of one hundred and feventy 
 pounds llerling. Hereupon we called him in, and told 
 him the caufe of his complaint fhcuid be removed, if he 
 would accompany us with the caravans;' and, therefore, we 
 defined to koow his mind. At this he (hook his head, 
 *' Great long journey," faid he, u me no pecune carry me 
 to Moic&Wv or keep me there. ,J Rut we foon put him out 
 of that concern, by making him fenfible of what we would 
 give him hert to lay out to the beft advantage : and* as for 
 his charges, we would fet him fafe on fhore, God willing, 
 either in Mufcovy, or England, as he pleafed, at our own 
 
 
 /Charge, except the carriage of his goods. At this propofal, 
 he was like a man tranfported, telling us, he would go with 
 us all the world over; and we made preparations for our 
 
 journey ; but it was near four months before all the mer- 
 chants were ready. 
 
 In the mean time, my partner and the pilot went exprefs 
 to the pm where we hYft put in, to difpofe of what goods 
 had been left there, while I accompanied a Chinefe mer- 
 chant who was going toNanquin, and there bought twenty- 
 nine pieces of damafk, with about three hundred more of 
 other fine filks; and by the time my, partner returned to 
 
 'pekin, I had them all carried thither; our cargo in filks 
 amounted to 4500/. fterling, which, together with tea, fine 
 
 -calicoes, nutmegs, and cloves, loaded eighteen camels for 
 our (hare, befides what we rode upon, with two or three 
 fpare horfes, and two more loaded with provifions ; the 
 
 ^company now was very great, making about four hundred 
 horfe, and above one hundred and twenty men, wellarmed 
 
 • and provided. We were of feveral nations, among whom 
 were five Scotch merchants, inhabiting in Mofcow, and 
 well experienced in trade. 
 
 We fet out from Pekin the beginning of February, our 
 flyle ; and in two days more, we pafled through the gate 
 of the great China wall, which was erefted as a fortifica- 
 tion againft the Tartars, being one hundred Englifti miles 
 long. We then entered a country n6t near fo populous, 
 chiefly under the power of plundering Tartars, feveral com- 
 panies of whom we perceived riding on poor ftarved horfes, 
 contemptible as themfelves, without order or discipline.— 
 One time our leader, for the day, gave us leave to go a 
 hunting; but what do you think we hunted t only a parcel 
 of fheep, which indeed exceeded any in the world for wild- 
 nefs and fwiftnefs; but while we wereipurfuing this game, 
 it was our chance to meet with about forty Tartars, who 
 no fooner perceived us, but one of them blew a horn, at 
 the found of which there foon appeared a troop of forty or 
 iifty more, at about a mile's diftance. Hereupon one of 
 the Scotch merchants (who knew their ways) ordered us to 
 advance towards them, and attack them immediately. As 
 we advanced, they let fly a volley of arrows, which happily 
 fell a little thort of us; this made us halt a little, to return 
 the compliment with bullets; and then being led up by 
 
 i 
 
 
 the bold Scot, we fired our piftols in their faces, and drew 
 out our fwords ; but there was no occafion ; for they flew 
 like titxorous fheep, and only three of them remained, 
 beckoning on the reft to come back. But our brave com- 
 mander galloped up to them by himfelf, mot one dead, 
 knocked another off his horfe, while the thjrd ran away ; 
 and thus ended cur battle with the Tartars. 
 
 We travelled a month mere through the Emperor of 
 China's dominions ; and at length coming to one of their 
 towns about a day and a half's journey from the city of 
 Naum, I wanted to buy a camel. The perfon I fpoke to 
 would have brought me one, but, like a fool, I muft go 
 along with him, about two miles from the village. My 
 old pilot and 1 walked on foot, forfooth, for fome variety, 
 when coming to the place where the camels were kept as 
 in a park guarded by Chinefe foldiers, we there agreed 
 and bought one, which the Chinefe man that came along 
 with me led along the road. But we had not gone far, be- 
 fore we were attacked by five Tartars, mounted on horfe- 
 back, two of whom feized the man, took the camel from 
 him, and rode away, while "the other .hree approached us, 
 the firft of whom fuddenly feized me as I was drawing my 
 fword, the fecond knocked me down, but my old truity 
 Portuguefe, taking a piftol out of his pocket, which I knew 
 nothing of, and coming up to the fellow that ftruck me, he 
 with one hand pulled him off his horfe, and then (hot him 
 dead upon the fpot; then taking his cimeter, he ltruck 
 at the man that flopped us, but miffing him, cut off one of 
 his horfe's ears, the pain of which made him throw his 
 rider to the ground. The poor Chinefe who had led the 
 Camel, feeing the Tartar down, runs to him, and feizing 
 upon his pole-axe, wrenched it from his hands, and knocked 
 his brains out. But there was another Tartar to deal with, 
 who feeming neither inclined to fight or fly, and my old 
 man having begun to charge his piilol, the fight of it ftruck 
 fuch a terror into the wretch, that away he fcoured, leav- 
 ing my old pilot, rather my champion and defender, an 
 abfolute victory. 
 
 By this time being awakened from my trance, I began 
 to open my eyes, wondering where I was, having quite 
 forgot all that patted; but my fenfes returning, and feeling 
 a great pain in my head, and feeing the blood was running 
 over my clothes, I inflantly jumped upon my feet, and 
 
 
 OF ROBINSON CRUSOK. 23 ( J 
 
 grafped my fword in- my hand, with a refolution to take re- 
 venge: but no enemies now remained, except the dead 
 Tartar/ with his horfe Handing by him. The old man 
 feting me recovered, whom he thought flain, ran towards 
 me, and embraced me with the greateft tendemefs, at the 
 fame time examining into my wound, which was far from 
 being mortal. When we returned to the village, the man 
 demanded payment for his camel , which I refuting* we 
 brought the caufe before a Chinefe judge, who acted whh 
 great impartiality: Having heard both tides, he afked the 
 Chinefe man that went with me, whofe fervant he was? 
 " Sir," faid he, " I am nobody's, but went with the ftran- 
 ger at his requefl :* "What then," faid the judge, "you 
 are the Granger's feivant for the time, and the camel be- 
 ing delivered to his fervant, it is the fame as though de- 
 livered to himfelf, and accordingly he mail pay for it." — : > 
 Indeed the cafe was fo fairly ftated, thai I had nothing to 
 object to it; fo having paid for that I was robbed of. I 
 fern for another, but did not go myfelf to fetch it, as I had 
 enough of that fport before. 
 
 The city of Ns^m is a frontier of the Chinefe empire, fo 
 fortified, as fome will* tell you, that millions of Tartars can- 
 not batter down their walls; by which certainly one might 
 think one of our cannons would do more execution than all 
 their legions. 
 
 When we were within a day's march of that city, we 
 had information that the governor had fent meflengers to 
 every part of the road, to inform the travellers and caravans 
 to halt, till a guard was fent to prctecl them from the nu- 
 merous bodies of Tartars that lately appeared about the 
 city. The news put us into great conilernation : but, 
 obeying the orders, we flopt ; and two days after, there 
 came two hundred foldiers from a garrifon of the Chintfe, 
 and three hundred more from Naum ; thus guarded both 
 in the front and rear, wi:h our own men in the flanks, we 
 boldly advanced, thinking we were able to combat with 
 ten thoufand Mogul Tartars, if they appeared. 
 
 Early next morning, in our march from a little well-fltti- 
 ated town, called Changu, after having pafled a river, and 
 entered upon a defert of about fifteen or tixteen miles over, 
 we foon beheld, by a cloud of duft that was raifed, that 
 the enemy was approaching. This much difpirited the 
 Chinefe. My old pilot took notice of it, and called out, 
 
 
 €t Seignior Ingl'fe, thofe fellows myft be encouraged, or they 
 will ruin us all; and I am afraid if the Tartars attack us, 
 they will all run away." " Why, Seignior/' laid I, u what 
 fhail be done in this cafe?" c Done," fays he, "why let 
 fifty of our men advance, and flank them on each wing. I 
 know the fellows will fight well enough in company." We 
 accordingly took his advice, and marched fifty to the right 
 wing, and the fame number to the left, and with the reft 
 made a line of referve, leaving the laft two hundred men 
 to guard the camels, or to alM us, as occafion required. 
 
 Thus prepared, a party of the enemy came forward, view- 
 ing our pofture, and traverfing the ground on the front of 
 our line. H coupon we ordered the two wings to move 
 on, and give them a falute with their fhot; which accord- 
 ingly was dene. This put a flop to their proceedings ; 
 for immediately wheeling off to their left, they all marched 
 away, and we law no more of them. They had undoubtedly 
 given an account to their companions of what reception 
 they might expect, which made them fo eafily give over 
 their enterprize. 
 
 When we ca«ne to the city of Naum, we returned the 
 governor hearty thanks, and diftributed a hundred crowns 
 among tre -foldiers that guarded us. We refled there one 
 day, and then proceeded on our travels, palling feveral 
 great rivers and defe» ts; and en the 13th of April we came 
 to the frontiers of Mufcovy, the firfl town of which was 
 called Argun. 
 
 This bappy occafion, as I thought, of coming into a 
 Chriftisn country, made me congratulate the Scots mer- 
 chant upen it. He fmiled at that, telling me not to rejoice 
 too foon ; "for," laid he, u except the Ruffian foldiers in 
 garrifon, and a few inhabitants of the cities upen the road, 
 all the reft of this country, for above a thoufand miles, is 
 inhabited by the moil ignorant and barbarous Pagans." 
 
 We advanced frcm the river Arguna by moderate jour- 
 neys, and found convenient gafrifens on the road, filled with 
 Chriftian foldiers, for the fecurity of commerce, and for 
 the convenient lodgings of travellers : but the inhabitants 
 of the cctntry were mere Pagans, woifhiping the- fun, mocn, 
 and ftars. We particularly obferved this idolatry near the 
 river Arguna, at a city inhabited by Tartars and Ruffians, 
 calltd Nerifinkey. Being curious to lee their way of liv- 
 ing* while the caravan continued to reft themfelves in thai 
 
 
 -city, I went to one of their villages, where there was 
 to be one of their solemn sacrifices. There I beheld, 
 upon the stump of an old tree, an idol of wood, more ugly 
 than the representation of the devil himself: its head 
 resembling no living creature; its ears were as big and as 
 high as goats' horns, a crooked nose, four-cornered mouth, 
 and horrible teeth : it was clothed in sheep skins, had a 
 great Tartar bonnet, with two horns growing through it, 
 and was eight feet high, without feet, legs, or proportion, 
 before this idol there lay sixteen or seventeen people, who 
 brought their offerings, snd were making their prayers, 
 while at a distance stood three men and one bullock, as 
 victims to this ugly monster. 
 
 Such stupendous sacrilege as this in robbing (he true 
 •God of his honour, filled me with thegreatest astonishment 
 and reflection ; which soon turning to rage and fury, I 
 rode up to the image, and cut in pieces the bonnet that 
 >was upon bis head with my sword, so that it hung down by 
 one of the horns, while one of my men that was with me 
 pulled at It by his sheep skin garment. Immediately an 
 hideous howling and outcry ran through the village, and 
 two or three hundred people coming about our ears, we 
 were obliged to fly for it. 
 
 But I had not done with the monster; for the caravan 
 being to rest three nights in 4he town, I told the Scots mer- 
 chant what I had seen, and thatl was resolved to take four 
 or five men well armed with me, in order to destroy the 
 idol, and show the people how little reason they had to trust 
 in a god who could not save himself: At first he lauglied 
 at me, representing the danger of it ; and when it was de- 
 stroyed, what time had we to preach to them better things, 
 whose zeal and ignorance were in the greatest degree, 
 *nd both unparelle.led ? that if I should be taken by them, I 
 should be served as a poor Russian who condemned their 
 worship ; that is, to be stripped naked, and tied to the top 
 of the idol, there shot at with arrows till my body was fulj 
 of them, and then burnt as a sacrifice to the monster j u but 
 Sir," said he, -** since your zeal carries you so far, rather 
 than you should be alone I will accompany you, and bring 
 a stout fellow equal to yourself, if you will, to assist you in 
 this design : and accordingly he brought one captain Rich- 
 ardson, who, hearing the story, readily consented; but my 
 partner declined it, being altogether out of his way: ana 
 
 Id 
 
 
 so we three, and my servant, resolved to execute (his ex- 
 ploit about midnight ; but upon second thoughts we defer- 
 red it to the next night, by reason that the caravan being 
 to go from hence the next morning, we should be out of 
 the governor's power. The better to cfK ctuate my design, 
 I procured a Tartar's sheep skin robe, a bonnet, wilh bow 
 and arrows, and every one of us got the like habits. The 
 first night we spent in mixing combustible matter with aqua- 
 vifa?, gunpowder, &c. having a good quantity of tar in a 
 little pot: the next night we came up to the idol about eleven 
 ©'clock, the moon being up. We found none guarding it; 
 but we perceived a light in the house, where we had 
 seen the priests before. One of our men was for firing the 
 hut, another for killing the people, and a third for ma- 
 king them prisoners, while the idol was destroyed. We 
 agreed to the latter ; so knocking at the door, we seized 
 the first that opened it, and stopping his mouth and tying 
 his feet, we left him. We served the other two in the like 
 manner : and then the Scots merchant set fire to the com- 
 position, which frightened them so much that we brought 
 them all away prisoners to their wooden god. There we 
 fell to work with him, daubing him all over with tar mixed 
 with tallow and brimstqne, stopping his eyes, ears, and 
 mouth full of gunpowder, with a great piece of wild-fire in 
 his bonnet, and environed it with dry forage. All this be- 
 ing done, we unloosed and ungagged the prisoners, and set 
 the idol on fire, which the gunpowder blowing up, the 
 shape of it was deformed, rent, and split, which the forage 
 utterly consumed : for we stayed to see its destruction, lest 
 the ignorant, idolatrous people should have thrown them- 
 selves into the flames. And thus we came away undis. 
 covered, in the morning appearing as busy among our fellow 
 travellers, as nobody could have suspected any other, but 
 ihat we had been in our beds all night. 
 
 Next mcrning we set out, and had gone but a small 
 distance from the city, when there came a multitude of 
 people of the country to the gates of the city, demanding 
 .satisfaction of the Russian governor for insulting their priests, 
 and burning the*; great Cham Chi-Thaungu, whodwelt in 
 the sun, and ho mortal would violate this image but some 
 Christian miscreants ; and being already no less than thirty 
 thousand strong, they announced war against him and all 
 |iis Christians. 
 
 
 The o-overnor assured them he was ignorant oflhe mat- 
 ter, and lhatnone of his garrison had been abroad ; that in- 
 deed there was a caravan that went away that morning, and 
 that he would send after them to inquire into it ; and who- 
 ever was the offender, should be deiivered into their hands. 
 This satisfied them for the present, but the governor sent 
 to inform us, that if any of us had dene it, we should make 
 all the haste away possible, while he kept them in play as 
 long as he could. Upon this we marched two days and 
 two nights, stopping but very Utile, till at last we arrived 
 at a village called Ploihus, and hastened to Jarawena, another 
 of the Czar's colonies. On the third day, having entered 
 the desert, and passed the lake called Sharks Oser, we beheld 
 a numerous body of horse on the other side of it to the 
 north, who supposed we had passed on that side of the lake; 
 but either having found the mistake, or being certainly in- 
 formed of the way we took, they came upon us towards the 
 dusk of the evening, just as we had pitched our camp be- 
 tween two little but very thick woods, with a little river 
 running before our front and some felled trees with which 
 we covered our rear; a precaution we always took, and 
 which we had just finished when the enemy came up.« — 
 They did not fail on us immediately, but sent three messen- 
 gers, demanding the men who had insulted their priests, 
 and burnt their god Cham Cni-Thaungu, that they migbt 
 be burnt with fire; that i^ this was complied with, they 
 would peaceably depart; but if not, they would de~ 
 'stroy one and all of us. Our men stared. at one another 
 on receipt of- this message, but nobody was the word, as 
 indeed nobody knew it, but he who did it. Upon which 
 the leader of the caravan returned for answer, " That they 
 were peaceable merchants, who meddled with none of their 
 priests and gods; and therefore desired them not to disturb 
 us, and put us under the necessity of defending ourselves. M 
 But so far was this from satisfying them, that the next morn- 
 ing coming to our right, they let fly a volley of arrows among, 
 us, which happily did not hurt any, because we sheltered 
 ourselves behind our baggage. We expected, however, to 
 come to closer engagement: but were happily saved by" 
 a cunning fellow, a Cossack, who obtaining leave of the 
 leader to go out, mounts his horse, rides directly from our 
 rear, and taking a circuit, comes up to the Tartars, as 
 £houghJie had been sent express, and tells them a formal 
 
 
 story, that the wretches who had burnt the Cham Chi- 
 Thaungu,ovvere gone to Shiheilka, mkh a resolution to burn 
 thegodShal-Isar, belonging to theTongueses. Upon which 
 believing this cunning Tartar, who was servant to our Mus- 
 covites, away they drove to Shiheilka, and in less than three 
 minutes were out of sight, nor did we ever hear of them more. 
 When, we came to the city of farawena, we rested five 
 days, and then entered into' a frightful desert, which held us 
 twenty-three days march, infested with several small com- 
 panies of robbers, or Mogul Tartars, who never had the 
 courage to attack us. After we had passed over this desert, 
 we found several garrisons to defend the caravans from the 
 violence of the Tartars: In particular the Governor of Adin- 
 skoy offered us a guard of fifty men to the next station, if 
 we apprehended any danger. The people here retained 
 the same paganism and barbarity, only they were not so 
 dangerous, being conquered by the Muscovites. The cloth- 
 ing, both of men and women, is of the skins of beasts, living 
 * >under the ground in vaults and caves, which have a com- 
 munication with one another. They have Jdojs almost in 
 every family: besides, they adore the sun and stars, water 
 and snow ; and the least uncommon thing that happens in 
 the elements, alarms them as much as thunder and light- 
 ning does the- unbelieving Jews. 
 
 Nothing remarkable occurred in our march through this 
 .country. When we had gone through the desert, after two 
 days farther -travel, we came to Jenezoy, a Muscovite city, 
 on the great river so called, which we were told parted Eu- 
 rope from Asia. The inhabitants here were very little bet- 
 ter, though intermixed with the Muscovites, but the won- 
 der will cea.se, when 1 inform ray reader of what was ob- 
 served to me, that the Czar, rather converts the Tartars 
 with soldiers than clergymen, and is more proud to make 
 them faithful subjects, than good Christians. 
 
 From the city to the river Oby, we travelled over a 
 pleasant, fruitful, but very uncultivated<country, for want 
 ofgood management and people, and those few are mostly 
 Pagans. This is the place where the Muscovite criminals 
 are banished to, if they are not put to death. The next 
 city we cajse to, was the capital city of Siberia, called To- 
 b iki, wjhen having been almost seven months on our jour> 
 liev, ana winter drawing on apace, my partner and I con- 
 sulteo about our particular affairs, in what manner we should 
 
 
 dispose of ourselves. We had been told* of sledges and 
 rein-deer to carry us over the snow in the winter' season, 
 the snow being frozen so hard, that the sledges can run 
 upon the surface without any danger of going down. As I 
 was bound to England, I now behoved either to go with the 
 caravan to Jereslaw, from thence west to Narva, and the 
 gulf of Finland, and so by land or sea to Denmark ; or 
 else I must leave the caravan at a little town on the Dwina, 
 and so to Archangel, where I was certain of shipping either 
 to England, Holland, or Hamburgh. One night I happened 
 to get into the company of an illustrious, but banished Prince, 
 whose company and virtues were such as made me pro- 
 pose to him a method how he might obtain his liberty.—- 
 * 5 My dear friend,* said he, *' as I am here happily free from 
 my miserable greatness, with all its attendants of pride, am- 
 bition, avarice, and luxury, if I should escape frfcm this place,- 
 those pernicious seeds may again revive, to my lasting dis- 
 quietude ' 7 therefore let me remain in a blessed confinement, 
 for I am but flesh, a mere man, with-passions and affections 
 as such : O be not my friend and tempter too!" Struck 
 dumb with surprise^ I stood silent awhile ; nor was he less 
 in disorder, by which perceiving he wanted to give vent to 
 his mind, I desired him to consider of it, and so withdrew. 
 But about two hours after became to nay apartment : "Dear 
 friend/' said he, "though 1 cannot consent to accompany 
 you, I shall have this satisfaction in parting, thatyou leave 
 me an honest man still; but as a testimony of my affection" 
 to you, be pleased to accept this present of sables." 
 
 In return for his compliment, I sent my servant next 
 morning to his Lordship with a small present of tea, two 
 pieces of China damask, and four little wedges of gold ;- 
 but he only accepted the tea, one piece, of damask, and one 
 piece of gold, for the curiosity of the Japan stamp that was 
 upon it. Not long after he sent for me, and told me that 
 what he had refused himself, he hoped, upon his account, I 
 "Would grant co another, whom he should name: In short it 
 was his only son, who was about two hundred miles distant 
 from him, on the other side of the city, whom he said he 
 would send for, if I gave my consent. This I soon com- 
 plied with ; upon which he sent his servant next day for 
 his son, who returned in twenty days time, bringing seven 
 horses loaded with valuable furs. At night the young Lord 
 was conducted incognito into our apartment, where his fa- 
 
 L3 
 
 
 ther presented him to me. We then concerted the best 
 ways for travelling, and after having bought a considerable 
 quantity of sables, black fox skins, fine ermines, &c. 
 (which I sold at Archangel at a good price,) we set out from 
 this city the beginning of June, making a small caravan, be- 
 ing about thirty-two horses and camels, of which I repre- 
 sented the head. My young Lord had with him a very 
 faithful Siberian servant, well acquainted with the roads. 
 We shunned the principal towns and cities, as Tumen, Soli, 
 Kamoskoi, and several others, by reason of their strictness 
 in examining travellers lest any of the banished persons of 
 distinction should escape. ; Having passed the river Kama, 
 we came to a city on the European side, called Soloy Ka- 
 moskoi; where w r e found the people mostly Pagans as before. 
 We then passed a desert of about, two hundred miles over; 
 but in other places it is near seven hundred. In passing 
 ibis wild place, we were beset by a troop of men on horse- 
 back, and about five and forty men armed with bows and 
 arrows. At first they looked earnestly on us, and then 
 placed themselves in our way. We were above sixteen 
 jnen, and drew up a little line before our camels. My 
 young Lord sent out his Siberian servant to know who 
 they were; but, when he approached them, he neither 
 knew a word they said, nor would they admit him to come 
 jjear them at bis peril, but prepared to shoot him. At his 
 return, he told us he believed them to be Calmuck Tar- 
 tars ; and that there were more upon the desert. This was 
 but a small comfort to us ; yet seeing a little grove, about 
 a quarter of a mile distance, we moved to it, by the old 
 Portuguese pilot's advice, without meeting with any oppo- 
 sition. Here we fuund a marshy piece of ground, and a 
 spring of water running into a little brook on one side, 
 which joined another Uke it a little farther off, and these 
 two formed the head of the river called Writska. As soon ' 
 as we arrived, we went to work, cutting great arms off the 
 trees, and laying them hanging not quite off from one tree 
 to another. In this situation we waited the motion of the 
 enemy, without perceiving any advancement they made 
 towards us. About two hours before night, being joined 
 by some others, in all about fourscore horses, among whom 
 we fancied were some women, they came upon us with great 
 fury. We fired without ball, calling to them in the Russian 
 tongue, to know their business ; butthey either not know- 
 
 
 ing, or deeming not to understand us, came directly to the 
 wood-side, noc considering that we were so fortified, as that 
 they could not break in. Our old pilot, the Portuguese, 
 proved both our captain and engineer, and desired us not 
 to fire till ihey came within pistol shot; and when he gave 
 the word of command, then to take the surest aim ; but he 
 did net bid us give fire, till they were within two pikes length 
 of us, and then we. killed fourteen of them, wounded seve- 
 ral, as also their horses, having every one of us loaded out 
 pieces with two or three bullets at least. So much were 
 they surprised at oar undauntedness; that they retired about 
 a hundred roods from us. In ihe mean while we loaded 
 our pieces again, and sallying.out, secured four or five of 
 their horses, whose riders we found were killed, and per- 
 ceived them to be Tartars. About an hour after, they 
 made another attempt, to see where they might break in ;. 
 but finding us ready to receive them, they retired; 
 
 All that night we wrqught hard, in strengthening our 
 situation, and barricading the entrance into the woods ; 
 but when daylight came, we had a very unwelcome dis* 
 covery; for the enemy being encouraged by their num- 
 bers, had set up eleven or twelve tents, in form of a camp, 
 about three quarters of a mile from us. I must confess, I 
 was never more concerned in my life, giving myself and 
 ail that I had over i\>t lost. And my partner declared, that 
 as the loss of his goods would be his ruin, before they should 
 be taken from him, he wouid fight to the last drop of his 
 blood. As we could not pretend to force our way> we had 
 recourse to a stratagem ; we kindled k large fire, which 
 burnt all night ; and no sooner was it "dark, but we pursued 
 our journey towards the pole, or north star ; and (ravelling 
 all night, by six o'clock in the morning we came to a Rus- 
 sian village, called Kertza, and from thence came to a large 
 town named Ozonzoys, where we heard that several troops 
 of Calmuck Tartars had been abroad upon the desert, but 
 that we were past all danger. In five days after we came 
 to Veuslima, upon the river Witzedga; from thence we 
 came to Lawrenskoy, on* the third of July, where, provi- 
 ding ourselves with two luggage-boats, and a convenient 
 bark, we embarked the sevenih, and arrived at Archangel 
 the eighteenth, after a year, five months, and three davs 
 journey, including the eight months and odd d*ys at To- ' 
 bolski. We ca*ne from Archangel the 20th of August ia 
 
 
 same yjear, and arrived at Hamburgh the 30th of Sep- 
 tember, Here my partner and I made a vtry good sale oi 
 our goods, both those of China and Siberia ; when, dividing 
 our effects, my share came to 3475 /. 17s. 3d. alter all the 
 losses we had sustained, and charges we had been at. 
 Here the young Lord took his leave of me, in order to go 
 to the Court of Vienna, not only to seek protection, but to 
 correspond with his father's friends. Alter we had staid 
 four months in Hamburgh, I went from thence over-land 
 to the Hague, where embarking in the packet,. I arrived in 
 London the 10th of January, 1705, after ten years and nine 
 months absence from England. 
 
 VISION OF THE ANGELIC WORLD. 
 
 CHAP. I. 
 
 OF SOLITUDE. 
 
 ; However solitude is looked upon as a restraint to the 
 pleasure of the world, in company and conversation, yet it 
 js a happy state of exemption from a s^a of trouble, an 
 inundation of vanity and vexation, of confusion and disap- 
 pointment. While we enjoy ourselves, neither the joy nor 
 sorrow of other men affect us: We are then at liberty, 
 with the voice of our soul, to speak to God. By this we 
 shun such frequent trivial discourse, as often becomes an ob- 
 struction to virtue : and how often do we find that we had 
 reason to wish we had not been in company, or said nothing 
 when we were there? for either we offended God by the im- 
 piety of our discourse, or lay ourselves open to the violence 
 of designing people by our unguarded expressions ; and 
 frequently feel the coldness and treachery of pretended 
 friends, when once involved in trouble and affliction; of 
 such unfaithful intimates, (I should say enemies,) who rather 
 by false inuendoes would accumulate miseries upon us, than 
 honestly assist us when under the hard hand of adversity. 
 But in a state of solitude, when our tongues cannoc be heard, 
 except from the great .Majesty of Heaven, how happy are 
 we in the blessed enjoyment of conversing with our Ma- 
 ker ! It is then we make him our friend, which ,sets us 
 
 
 above the envy and contempt of wicked men. When a 
 man converses with himself,- he is sure that he does not 
 converse with an enemy. Oar retreat should be to good 
 company, and good booksT I mean not by solitude, that 
 a man should retire into a cell, a desert, or a rrorastery: 
 which would be altogether an useless and unprofitable re- 
 straint : for as men are formed for society, and have an 
 absolute necessity and dependence upon one r.nother, so 
 there is.a retirement of the soul, with which it converses in 
 heaven, even in the midst of men; and indeed no man U. 
 more fit to speak freely, than he who can, without any 
 violence to himself, refrain his tongue,. or keep silence alto- 
 gether. As to religion, it is by this the soul gets acquaint- 
 ed with the hidden mysteries of the holy writings ; here 
 shefinds those floods of tears, in which good men wash them- 
 selves day and night, and only makes a visit to God, and 
 his holy angels. In this conversation the truest peace and 
 most solid joys are to be found ; it is a continual feast of 
 contentment on earth, and the means of attaining everlast- 
 ing happiness in heaven. 
 
 CHAP; in- - 
 
 of honesty: 
 
 Honesty is a virtue beloved by good men, and pretended" 
 to by all other persons. In this tliere are several degrees; 
 to pay every man his own is- the common law of honesty^ 
 but to do good to all mankind, is the chancery law of ho- 
 nesty | and this chancery court is in every man's breast, 
 where his conscience is a Lord Chancellor. Hence it is, 
 that a miser, though he pays every body their own, ccnaot 
 be an honest man, when he does not discharge the good 
 offices that are incumbent on a friendly, kind, and generous 
 person : for, saith the prophet Isaiah, crrap. xxxii. ver. 7, 8. 
 f * The instruments of a churl are evil r he deviseth wicked 
 devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when 
 the- needy speaketh right. But the liberal soul deviseth 
 liberal things, and by liberal things shall he stand." It is 
 certainly honest to do every thing the law requires ; but 
 siteftld yvfc throw every poor debtor into prison till he has 
 
 L5 
 
 
 paid the utmost farthing, hang every malefactor without 
 mercy, exact the penalty of every bond, and the forfeiture 
 of every indenture, this would be downright cruelty, and 
 not honesty ; and it h contrary to that general rule, " To do 
 to another, that which you would have done unto you." 
 Sometimes necessity makes an honest man a knave ; and a 
 rich man an honest man, because he has no occasion to be 
 a knave. The trial of honesty is this: Did you ever want 
 bread, and had your neighbour's loaf in keeping, and would 
 starve rather than cat it ? Were you ever arrested, having 
 in your custody another man's cash, and would rather go to 
 gaol, than break it ? if so, this indeed may be reckoned ho- 
 nesty. For King Solomon tells us, u That a good name is 
 better than life, and is a precious ointment, and which, 
 when a man has once lost, he has nothing left worth keeping." , 
 
 CHAP. JIT. 
 
 0/ the present state of RELIGION in the World. 
 
 I doubt, indeed, there is much more devotion than reli- 
 gion in the world ; more adoration than supplication ; and 
 more hypocrisy than sincerity : and it is very melancholy to 
 consider, what numbers of people there are furnished with 
 the powers of reason and gifts of nature, and yet abandoned 
 to the grossest ignorance and depravity. But it would be 
 Tancharitablc for us to imagine (as some papists, abou-nding 
 with too much ill-nature, the only scandal to religion, do), 
 that they will certainly be in a state of damnation after this 
 life : or how can we think it consistent with the mercy and ' 
 goodness of an infinite Being, to damn those creatures, when 
 be has not furnished them with the light of the gospel? or 
 how can such proud, conceited, and cruel bigots, prescribe 
 rules to the justice and mercy of God ? 
 
 We are told by some people, that the great image which 
 King Nebuchadnezzar setup to be adored by his people* 
 beld the representation of the sun in his right-hand, as the 
 principal object ®f adoration. But to wave this discourse of 
 Heathens, how many self-contradicting principles are there 
 held among Christian's? and how do we doom one another 
 to the devil, while all profess to worship the same Deity 5 
 and to expect the same salvation ?. 
 
 
 When I was in Portugal, there was held at that time the 
 court of justice of the inquisition. All the criminals were 
 carried in procession to the great church, where eight of 
 them, were habited in gowns and caps of canvas, whereon 
 the torments of hell were displayed, and they were con- 
 demned and burnt for crimes against the Catholic faith - 
 blessed Virgin. _ ians; h[lt 
 
 • i am . so "y/° raa ke any reflections upme most cruel and, 
 indeed in Italy the Roman religio/yj ac jicious person, who 
 percenary upon earth ^^^rurkey, tells, "That there is 
 travelled through ^outward pomp of religion there : that 
 *f fi? i ^« protects murderers and assassins, and then -de- 
 i. ..•ers the civil magistrates over to Satan for "doing justice m r 
 ? interdicts whole kingdoms, and shuts up the churches for 
 u want of paying a few ecclesiastical dues, and so puts a 
 "a stop to religion for want of their money : that thecourt- 
 u of inquisition burnt two men for speaking dishonourably 
 ** of the blessed Virgin y, and the missionaries of China to- 
 " lerated the worshiping the devilby their new converts t 
 u that Italy was the theatre, where religion was the grand 
 "opera; and that the popish clergy were no other than 
 u the stage players." 
 
 As to religion in Poland, they deny Christ to be the 
 Messiah, or that the Messiah has come in the flesh. Ami 
 as to their Protestants, they are the followers of Laelius'Ss- 
 cinus, who denied our Saviour's divinity \ and have no con- 
 cern about the divine inspiration of the Holy Ghost. 
 
 In Muscovy, their churches are built of wood, and indeed,, 
 they have but wooden priests, though of the Greek church ; ; 
 they pray as much to saintNicholas, as the Papists do to the 
 VirginMary,for protection in all their difficulties or afflictions,- 
 As to the Lutherans, they only differ from the Romans in 
 believing consubstantiation, instead of transubstantiation | 
 but, like them, they are much -pleased with the external gal- 
 lantry and pomp, more than the true and real practice of it. 
 
 Iii France I found a world of priests, the streets every 
 where crowded with them, and the churches full of woman : 
 hut surely never was a nation so full of blind guides, so ig- 
 norant of religion, and even so void of morals, as tliusa 
 people who confess their sins to them. 
 
 Does it not seem stranga, that, while all men own the* 
 . Divine. Bjin^, there should bs so many diff;re;n opinions 
 
 L6 
 
 
 as to the manner of paying him obedience in the Chfw ^ 
 
 church ! I know not what reason to assign for this, except 
 
 it be their different capacities and faculties. 
 
 And, indeed* upon this account, we have perceived, m 
 
 all Christian countries, what mortal feuds have been about 
 -ftlijrion ; what wars and bloodshed have molested Europe, 
 treaty ovneral pacification of the German troubles at the 
 fion in the sa'mbalia; and since those times, what persecu- 
 rans ; and should 1 fcjtu among the churches of the Luthe- 
 divisions are between ChrislSP*** al home > what unha PPy 
 Episcopacy and Presbytery; the cKu.l hls kingdom, about 
 Dissenters opposing one another like St. £fd!g ,a j£ a " d the 
 even to the face ; that is, they carry on the dispulv t i ? r * 
 utmost extremity. 
 
 It might be a question, why there are such differences in 
 religious points, and why these breaches should be more 
 hot and irreconcilable ? Ail the answer I can give to this,, 
 is, that we inquire more concerning the truth of religion, 
 than any other nation in the world ; and the anxious con- 
 cern we have about it, makes us jealous of every opinion* 
 and tenacious of our own : and this is not because we are 
 more furious and rash than other people ;, but the truth is, 
 we are more concerned about them, and being sensible that 
 the Scripture is the great rule of faith, the standard for life . 
 and doctrine, we have recourse to it ourselves, without sub* 
 mitting to any pretended infallible judge upon earth. 
 
 There is another question pertinent to the former, and 
 that is, What remedy can we apply to this malady ? And Id 
 this I must negatively answer, Not to be less religious, that 
 we may differ the less* This is striking at the very root of 
 all religious differences ; for, certainly, were they to be 
 carried on with a peaceable spirit* willing to be informed, 
 our variety of opinions would not have the name of differ- 
 ences ; nor should we separate in communion of charity, 
 though we did not agree in several articles of religion. 
 
 Nor is there a less useful question to start, namely, Where 
 will our unhappy religious differences end ? To which, I 
 hope, I may answer, in Heaven ; there all unchristian and 
 unbrotherly differences will find a period ; there we shall 
 embrace many a sinner, that here we think it a dishonour 
 !o c©nverse with ; and perceive many a heart we have bro- 
 ken here with censureSj reproaches 5 , and reviling% rfc'aile 
 
 
 an 
 
 whole again by the balm of the same Redeemer s b bod. 
 Here we shall perceive there have been other flocks th 
 those of our fold ; that these we have excommunicated ham 
 been taken into that superior communion ; and, ma word, 
 ^ those contradicting notions and principles which we 
 thougn.; nconsistent w i t h true religion, we shall then rind 
 reconcilable themselves, to one another, and to the foun-

 Before I conclude this chapter, I shall V^g leave to (lis- 
 purse «- little on a,** wonderful excellency of negative re- 
 ligion and Wj»tive^ft^. The UUef sets — ,- |ke tne 
 Pharisee, with—God, I thai, <hee . ii ^ a piece -of religi- 
 ous pageantry, the hypocrite s l^ t s and J n a w( . fi Jg 
 positive vice : for it is either a mask la ^ceive ethers or a 
 mist to deceive ourselves. A man that is C^fUed wiih ne- 
 gatives, thus argues; 1 am not such a drunkard a** , v j an( j m 
 Jord> such a thief as my tenant,suci* a swearer as his ntr.^ 
 hour; neither am I a cheat, an atheist, a rakish fellow, or 
 a highwayman ; no ! I live a sober, regular, .retired life ; I 
 am a good man, I go to church ; God, I thank thee, Now, 
 though a man boast of his virtue in contradiction to the 
 vices mentioned, yet a person had better have them alto-* 
 gether than the man himself; for he is full of himself; so 
 persuaded that he is good and religious enough already, 
 that he has no thoughts, of any thing, except it be topulldff 
 his hat to God Almighty now and then, and thank him thaf 
 he has no occasion for him ; and has the vanity to think 
 that his neighbours must imagine well of him too. 
 
 The negative man, though he is no drunkard, is yet in- 
 toxicated with the pride of his own worth; a good neigh- 
 bour and peace- maker in other families, but a tyrant in his 
 own; appears in a church for a show, but never falls upon 
 his knees in his closet ; does all his alms before men, to be 
 seen of them; eager in the duties of the second table, but 
 regardless of the first ; appears religious, to be taken notice 
 of by men, but without intercourse or communication be* 
 
 
 tween God and his own soul : Prav, what Is this man * 
 of what comfort is there of the life he lives ? He is insensible 
 or faith, repentance, and a Christian mortified life : in a worn' 
 He is perfectly a stranger to the essential part of relia-' " 
 
 Let us for a while enter into the private and r- lfed P art 
 of his conversation : What notions has he pfnis- mis-spent 
 hours, and of the progress of time to tb<= great rentre and 
 gulf of life, eternity ? Does he know how '° P^t a right 
 value on time, or esteem the life-bloor 1 °f\ n * s s«ul, as id 
 really is, and act in all the moment**'* l{ > as on . e that must 
 account for them ? if then vou c^ torm an e ^^' li y between 
 what he can do and wh?' ne sna " rece i ve 5 less can be 
 f mnded upon his negat> ve virtue, or what he has forborne 
 to do : And if nei^er. his negative nor positive. piety can 
 be equal to the reward, and to the eternity tkai- reward is 
 to last for, what then is to become of * L ~ rhan'ecc, wb*- 
 he is to he judged b^he sinceri* ^ his repentance, and 
 rewarded,;accorJing to tn/-f^^ grace of God, with a . 
 state of bles^dness to - 'endless eternity ?• 
 
 Whe» the x\e^^ iye rr,an converses with the invisible 
 wor/d he ic^ Ji ed with as much horror and dread as Felix,, 
 w j ien c>. ^aul reasoned to him of temperance, righteous* 
 p ^,5, and of judgment to come ; for Felix, though a great 
 philosopher, of great power and reverence, was a negative 
 man, and he was made sensible by the Apostle, that, as a 
 life of virtue 'and temperance was its own reward, by giving 
 a healthy body, a clear head, and a composed life, so eter- 
 nal happiness must proceed from another spring; namely », 
 the infinite unbounded grace of a provoked God, who hav- 
 ing erected a righteous tribunal, Jesus,Christ would sepa* 
 rate such as by faith and repentance he had brought borne 
 and united to himself by the grace of adoption, and on the 
 fool of his having laid down his life as a ransom for them, 
 had appointed them to salvation, when all the philosophy, 
 temperance> and righteousness in the world besides had 
 been ineffectual. And this, I. say, it was, that made Felix* 
 this negative man, tremble* 
 
 CHAP. IV. 
 
 Of listening to the voice of Prov-idence. 
 The magnificent and wise king Solomon bids Us cry after? 
 knowledge, and. lift up our voice for understanding; by 
 
 
 which is meant, religious knowledge ; for it follows : (i Then 
 shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the 
 knowledge of God." By which undoubtedly he meant to 
 inquire after every thing he has permitted us to know, and 
 not search into those ways that are unsearchable, and are 
 effectually locked up from our knowledge. — Now, " as 
 listening to the voice of Providence" is my«present subject, 
 I intend, in the first place, to write to those who own — 1. 
 That there is a God, a first great moving cause of aH things> 
 an eternal power, prior, and consequently superior to all 
 created power or being. — 2. That this eternal power, which 
 is God, is the sovereign creator and governor of heaven and 
 earth. , 
 
 To avoid all needless distinctions, what persons in the God- 
 head exercises the creating, and what the governing power, 
 I offer that glorious text, Psal. xxiii. 6. where the whole 
 Trinity is entitled to the whole creating Work : and therefore, 
 in the next place, I shall lay down these two propositions: 
 
 J. That the eternal God guides, by his Providence, the 
 whole universe, which was created by his power. 
 
 II. That this Providence manifests a part4cular care over,, 
 and concern in, the governing and directing man, the most 
 noble creature upon earth.. 
 
 It is plain, that naturaPreligion proves the first, by inti- 
 mating the necessity of a Providence guiding and govern- 
 ing the world, from theconsequence.of the wisdor» ? justice, 
 prescience, and goodness of the Almightv Creator : for 
 otherwise it would be absurd to think, that God should 
 create a world, without any care or providence over it, in 
 guiding the operations of nature, so as to preserve the 
 order of his creation. 
 
 Revealed religion gives us a light into the care and con- 
 cern of his providence, by the climate's being made habit- 
 able, the creatures subjected and made nourishing, and all- 
 vegetative life made medicinal ; and all this for the sake of 
 man, who is made viceroy to the King of the earth. The 
 short description I shall give of Providence is this : "That* 
 it is that operation of the power, of the wisdom, justice, 
 and goodness of God, by which he influences, governs^ arwi 
 directs, not only the means, but the e nt's of all things, 
 which concerns us in this sublunary world ; the sovereignty 
 of which we ought always to reverence, obey its motions, 
 observe its dictates, and listen to its voice, The prudent 
 
 
 man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; that is, as I take 
 it, there is a- secret Providence intimates to as, that some 
 danger threatens, if we strive not to shun it/' 
 
 The same day that Sir John Hotham kept out Hull against 
 the royalMartyr King Charles I. the same day Sir John 
 Hotham was put to death by the parliament For that very 
 action : The same day that the King himself signed the war- 
 rant for the execution of the Earl of Strafford, the same day 
 of the month was he barbarously- murdered by the blood- 
 thirsty Oliverian crew : and the same day that King JamesII. 
 came to the crown against the bill of exclusion, the same 
 day he was voted abdicated by the parliament, and the 
 throne filled with King William and Queen Mary. 
 
 The voice of signal deliverances from sudden danger, is- 
 not only a just call to repentance, but a caution against fall- 
 ing into the like danger; but such who are utterly careless 
 of themselves after, show a lethargy of the worst nature,, 
 which seems to me to be a kind of practical atheism, or at 
 least living in a contempt of Heaven, when he receives 
 good at the hand of his Maker, but is unconcerned from 
 whence it comes, or to thank the bountiful hand that gave 
 it ; neither, when he receives evil, does it alter his manner 
 of life, or bring him to any state of humiliation. 
 
 We have a remarkable story of two soldiers being con- 
 demned to death in Flanders. The General being prevailed 
 upon to spare one of them, ordered them to cast dice upon 
 the drumhead for their live* ; the first having thrown two 
 sixes, the second fell & wringing his hands, having so poor a 
 chance to escape ; however, having thrown, he was surprised 
 when he also threw other two sixes. The officer appointed 
 to see the execution, ordered them to throw again ; they 
 did so, and each of them threw lives • at which the soldiers 
 that stood round, shouted, and said, neither of them was to 
 die. Upon this, the officer acquainted the council of war, 
 who ordered them to throw r a third time, when they threw 
 two fours; the General being acquainted with it, sent for 
 the men, and pardoned them ; I love, said he, in such ex- 
 traordinary cases, to listen to the voice of Providence. 
 
 We read in the holy writings, how God speaks tp men 
 by appearances of angels, or by dreams and visions of the 
 night. As God appeared to Abraham, Lot, and Jacob 2 
 so angels have appeared to many in other cases, as to Ma» 
 Roan and his wife, Zachariah, the Virgin Mary, and to tiu^ 
 
 
 Apostles ; others have been warned in a dream, as King 
 Abimelech, the false prophet Balaam, and many others. 
 
 It is certainly a very great and noble inquiry, " What we 
 .shall be after this lifer** for there is scarce a doubt that 
 there is a place reserved for the reception of our souls after 
 death ; for if we are to be, we must have a where, which 
 the Scriptures assert by the examples of Dives and Lazarus. 
 The doctrine of spirits was long believed before our Sa- 
 viour's time ; for when the disciples of the blessed Jesus 
 perceived our Saviour walking on the sea, they were as 
 much surprised as though they had seen a spirit* Nay, in 
 those ages of the world, it was believed that spirits inter- 
 meddled in the affairs of mankind ; and throughout the Old 
 Testament, I do not find any thing that in the least con-' 
 tradicts it. Ail the pains and labour that some learned men 
 have taken, to confute the sfory of the witch of Endor, and 
 the appearance of an old man personating Samuel, cannot 
 make such apparitions inconsistent with, nature or religion;. 
 and it is plain, that it was either a good or a bad spirit, that 
 prophetically told the unfortunate king what should happen 
 the next day ; for, said the spirit, u The Lord will deliver 
 " thee into the hands of the Philistines; and to-morrow 
 " shalt thou and thy sons be with me," 
 
 Abundance of strange notions possessed me, when I was, 
 in the desolate island ; especially on a moonshine night, 
 when every bush seemed a man, and every tree a man on 
 horseback. When 1 crept into the dismal cave where the 
 old goat lay expiring, whose articulate groans even resem- 
 bled those of a man, hqw r was I surprised 1 my blood chil- 
 led in my veins, a cold sweaty dew sat on my forehead,, 
 my hair stood upright, and my joints, like Belshazzar's 
 knees, struck against one another. And, indeed, though I 
 afterwards found what it was, the remains of this surprise 
 did not wear off for a great while ; and I had frequently 
 returns of those vapours on different occasions, and some- 
 times without any occasion at all. 
 
 One night, after having seen some appearance in the air, 
 as I had just laid down in my bed, one of my feet pained 
 me ; after that came a numbness, succeeded with a tingling 
 in my blood; when on a sudden I thought something alive 
 lay upon me, from my knee to above half my leg. Upon 
 this I flung myself out of bed where I thought the creature 
 lay ; but finding nothing, ** Lord, deliver me from an evil 
 
258 life and adventures 
 
 spirit/* said I; "what can ibis be V* When I lighted a 
 candle, 1 could perceive no Jiving creature in the place 
 with me, but the poor parrot, who being frightened, cried 
 out, " Hold your tongue/' a*id >" What's the matter with 
 you?*' which words' I had taught him by saying so to him, 
 when he had made such screaming noises as I did not like. 
 ''Lord," said I aloud, ''surely the devil has been here." 
 "Hold your tongue," says Poll. I was then mad at the 
 bird, and putting on my clothes, cried, ° lam terribly 
 " frightened."' " What's the matter with you ;" says PolL 
 " You toad/' said I, " VII knock your brains out." " Hold 
 * r your tongue/' cried he again, and so fell a chattering, 
 and called Robinson Crusoe, as he did before. But after 
 1 had composed myself, and went to bed again, I began 
 plainly to see it was a distemper that affected my nerves,, 
 and so my terrors vanished at once. 
 
 How intelligences are given or received, we do not know; 
 nor are we sensible how they are conveyed from spirits em- 
 bodied to ours that are in life ; or, on the contrary, from us 
 to them ; the latter is certainly done w;lhout the help of the 
 organs, and the former is conveyed by the understanding, 
 and the retired faculties of the soul. 
 
 The spirits, without the help of voices, converse ; and 
 the mere particular discoveries of converse of the spirits, 
 seem to me as follow : to wit, dreams, voices, noises, im- 
 pulses, hinis,_ apprehensions, involuntary sadness, &c. 
 
 Dreams of old were the ways by which God himself was 
 pleased to warn men what services to perform and what to 
 shun. Joseph was directed of God in a dream to go to 
 Egypt; and so were the wise men warned in a dream to 
 depart into their own country another way, to avoid the 
 fury of Herod. I am not like those who think dreams are 
 the mere, designs of a delirious head, or the relics of a day's 
 perplexities or pleasures; but on thecontrary> I must beg 
 leave to say, I never met with any capital mischief in my 
 life, but I had some notice of it by a dream ; and had I not 
 been a thoughtless, unbelieving creature, Imighthav;e taken 
 many a warning, and avoided many o{ the evils I after- 
 wards fell into, merely by total neglect of those dreams. 
 
 I was once present at a dispute between a layman and a 
 clergyman, upon the subject of dreams. The first thought 
 no regard should be given unto them : that their communi- 
 cation from the invisible to the visible world was a mere. 
 
 
 chimera ; without any solid foundation. For, first, said he, 
 if dreams were from the agency of any prescient 4)eing, the 
 motives would be more direct, and the discoveries more 
 plain, and not by allegories and emblematic fancies, ex- 
 pressing things imperfect and obscure. 2. Since, with the 
 notice of evil, there was not a power given to avoid it, it 
 is not likely to proceed from a spirit, but merely fortuitous. 
 
 3. That the inconstancy of such notices, in cases equally 
 important, proves they did not proceed from any such agent. 
 
 4. That as our most distinct dreams had nothing in them of 
 'a^y significancy, it would be irrational and vain to think 
 
 that they came from heaven. And, 5. That as men were 
 not always thus warned or supplied with notice of good or 
 evil, so all men are not alike supplied with them ; and what 
 reason could we give, why one man or ©ne woman should 
 not have the same hints as another? 
 
 To all this the clergyman gave answer | 1. That as to 
 the signification of dreams, and the objections against them* 
 as being dark and doubtful, they are expressed generally by 
 hieroglyphicaIrepresentations,similies, allusions, and figura- 
 tive emblematic ways, by which means, for want of inter- 
 pretation, thething was not understood, and, consequently, 
 the evil not shunned. 2. That we charge God foolishly, 
 to say, that he has given the notice of evil, without the 
 power to avoid it; for, if any one had not power to avoid 
 the evil, it was no notice to htm ; and it was want of giving 
 due heed to that notice, that men first, neglected themselves, 
 and then charged the Judge of all the earth with injustice. 
 3. That we ought not to find fault with the inconstancy of 
 these notices, but rather with our weak understandings^ 
 by pretending dreams were not to be regarded, and negli- 
 gent when the voice really spoke to us for our good. It is 
 a mistake to say dreams have no import at all : we might, 
 with more reason, have said, none that we could perceive 
 the reason of, owing to our blindness and supine negligence, 
 too secure at one time, and too much alarmed at another; 
 so that the spirit, which we might be said to be conversing 
 with in a dream, was constantly and equally kind and care- 
 ful ; but our powers are not always in the same state of 
 action, not equally attentive to, or retentive of the hints 
 that were given. And 4. To answer the last question, 
 Why people are not equally supplied ? This seems to be 
 no question $ for Providence itself might have some share b. 
 
 
 the direction of it, and then that Providence might be li- 
 mited by a superior direction ; that as to the converse of 
 spirits, he could not call it a stated converse : such a thing 
 there was, bat why there was so much of it, and no more, 
 was none of his business, and that no such discovery had 
 ever yet been made to mankind, Nor were we to imagine 
 less of waking dreams, trances, visions, noises* hints; im- 
 pulses, and all the waking testimonies of an invisible world, 
 and of the communication that there is between us and 
 them, which commonly entertain us with our open eyes. 
 
 One time my fancy soared on high, to see what disco** 
 veries I could make in those clearer regions. I found that 
 such immense bodies as the sun, stars, planets, and moon, 
 in the great circle of the lower heaven, are far from being 
 found in the study of nature on the surface of the earth. 
 Here I saw many things that we can entertain little or no 
 notion of, in a state of common life, and the emptiness of 
 our notion, that the planets are habitable worlds • that is, 
 created like ours, for the subsistence and existence of man 
 and beast, and the preservation of the vegetative and sensi- 
 tive life : No, no ; this is, I assure you, a world of spirits ; 
 for here I saw a clear demonstration of Satan being the 
 prince of the power of the air, keeping his court or camp, 
 with innumerable angels to attend him ; but his power is 
 not so great as we imagine, he can tempt us to the crime, 
 but cannot force us to commit : Humanum estpeccarc. Nei- 
 ther has the devil power to force the world into a rebellion 
 against heaven, though his legions are employed among; 
 savage nations, to set up their master for a god, who make 
 the heathens either worship him in person, or by his repre- 
 sentatives* idols and monsters, with the cruel sacrifices of 
 human blood. Now, as to the limitatiens of the devil's 
 power, you must understand, that, as there are numbers of 
 evil spirits employed in mischief, so there are numbers of 
 good angels sent from the higher and blessed abodes to dis- 
 concert and oppose their measures; and this every Christian, 
 I hope, believes, when he prays to God, the father of spi- 
 rits, to give his angels charge over him while he slumber- 
 eth and sieepeth. For if by these preventing powers the 
 devil was not restrained, the earth would be subjected to 
 dearth, droughts, and famine; the air infected with noxious 
 fumes; and, in a word, mankind would be utterly destroyed^ 
 which might oblige our Maker (if I may be allowed the 
 
 
 expression) to the necessity of a new fiat, or else have no 
 more creatures to honour and worship him. 
 
 As the devil never wanted insinuators, I shall observe 
 that I learned a way how to make a man dream of what I 
 pleased. For instance, let as suppose one to be sound 
 asleep; let another lay bis mouth close to his ear, and whis- 
 per any thing so softly, as not to awake him, the sleeping 
 man shall dream of what has been so whispered in his ear ; 
 nay, I can assure you, those insinuating devils can do this . 
 even when we are awake, which I call impulses of the mind: 
 for from whence, but from these insinuators, come our cause- 
 less passions., involuntary wickedness, or sinful desires ? Who 
 else form ideas in the mind of man when. he ks asleep, or pre* 
 sefct terrible or beautiful figures to his fancy ? Mj. Milton 
 represents the devil tempting Eve in the shape of a toad, 
 lying just at her ear, when in her b©wer she lay fast asleep ; 
 and brings in Eve telling Adam what an uneasy night's 
 4rest she had, and relating her dream to him. And likewise 
 I believe that good spirits have the same intercourse with 
 us, in warring us against those things that are evil, and 
 .prompting us to that which is good. 
 
 Were we to have the eyes of our souls opened, through 
 4he eyes of our bodies, we should see this very immediate 
 region of air which we breathe in, thronged with spirits 
 now invisible, and which otherwise wouldtbe the most ter- 
 rible; we should view the secret transactions of those mes- 
 sengers who are employed when the parting soul takes its 
 leave of the reluctant body, and perhaps see things Nature 
 would shrink back from with the utmost terror and amaze- 
 ment. In a word, the curtain of Providence for the dis- 
 position of things here, and the curtain of judgment for the 
 determination of the state of souls hereafter, would be alike 
 drawn back; and what heart could support here its future 
 state in life; much less that of its future state after life, 
 -even good or bad. 
 
 A gentleman of my acquaintance, being about seven miles 
 distant from London, a friend that came to dine with him, 
 solicited him to go to the city. « What/' said the gentle- 
 man, <' is there any occasion for me ? f> " No, Sir," said the 
 other, " nothing at all, except the enjoyment of your good . 
 company:" and so gave over importuning him. Just then 
 a strong impulse of mind urged the gentleman, and pursued 
 him like a voice, with, ' < Go to London, Go to London/' 
 
 
 '.* Hark ye," says he to his friend, " is all well at London? 
 Am I wanted there? Or, did you ask me to go with you on 
 any particular account? Are all my family well?'* " Yes, 
 indeed. Sir," said he, "I perceived them all very hearty ; 
 and I did not ask you to go to London upon any particular 
 account whatsoever, except it was for the sake of yourgood 
 company." Again he put cfF his resolution : but still the 
 impulse suggested to him, " Go to London ;" and at length 
 he did so. Wren he came there, he found a letter, and a 
 messenger had been (here to seek him, and to tell him of a 
 particular business, which was at first and last above a thou- 
 sand pc unds to him, and which might inevitably have been 
 lost, had he not gene to London that night. 
 
 The obeying of several hints, or secret impulses, argues 
 great wisdbm. I knew a man that was under misfortunes, 
 being guilty of misdemeanors against the government; 
 when, absconding for hit of his iuin, all his friends advi- 
 sing him not to put himself into the hands of the law, one 
 morning as he awaked, he felt a strong impulse darting in- 
 to his mind thus, < ; Write a letter to them ; ?> and this was. 
 repeated several limes to his mind, and at last he answered 
 to it, as if it had been a voice, "Whom shall I write \oV 
 Immediately it replied, ".Write to the Judge :" and this 
 impulse pursued him for several days, (ill at length he took 
 pen, ink, and paper, and sat down to write to him : when 
 immediately words flowed from his pen like streams from 
 a fair fountain, that charmed even himself with hopes of 
 success. In short, the letter was so strenuous in argument, 
 so pathetic in its eloquence, and so persuasively moving, 
 that when the judge had read it, he sent him an answer, he 
 might be easy, he would endeavour to make that matter 
 light to him : and, indeed, never left exerting himself till 
 -he had stopt the prosecution, and restored him to his liberty 
 and family. 
 
 While I am mentioning these things, methinks it is very 
 hard that we should obey the whispers of evil spirits, und 
 not much rather receive the notices which good ones are 
 pleased to give. We never perceive the misfortune of this, 
 but when in real danger ; and then we cry, " My mind mis- 
 gave me when I was gojng about it:" but if so, why do you 
 slight the caution ? Why not listen to it as to a voice? and 
 then there had been no reason to make this complaint.

 I remember about fourteen or fifteen years ago (as to 
 time I cannot be very positive) there was a young clergy- 
 man in the city of Dublin, in Ireland, who dreamed a very 
 uncommon dream, That a gentleman had killed his wife, a 
 relation of his, by stabbing her in several places; the fright 
 of this awakened him, but finding it a dream, he composed 
 himself again to sleep, when he dreamed a second time the 
 same dream. This made him a little uneasy ; but thinking 
 it proceeded from the impression made upon his mind by the 
 former, he went to sleep again, and dreamed the same 
 dream a third time also. So troubled w r as he at this, that 
 he rose, and knocked at his mother's chamber, told his 
 concern, and his apprehensions that all was not right at his 
 
 * relation's house. " Dear Son," says the good old gentle- 
 woman, " do not mind those foolish dreams; and I very 
 much, wonder, that you, being a person in holy orders, should 
 have regard to such illusions. 7 ' Upon this he went to bed 
 again, fell asleep, and dreamed a fourth time as before. — 
 And then indeed he put on his night-gown, anu went to 
 Smithfield, the place where his relation dwelt. Here it - 
 was, alas ! he perceived his dream too sadly fulfilled, by 
 seeing his relation, the young lady, big with child, who was 
 a protestant, stabbed in several places by her barbarous- 
 husband, Mr. Eustace, a violent Papist, only for some dis- 
 courses of religion that happened Che day before. After 
 the wretch had stabbed her in three places, he went to 
 
 i make his r^cape out at a window ; but she cried out, 
 4t My dear ! don't leave me, come back and I shall be well 
 again." At which he returned in a hellish rage, and gave 
 her four wounds more ; when even in this condition, rising 
 from her bed, she wrapped herself in her nightgown, and 
 went to the Lord Bishop of Raphe's chamber door, (the 
 Bishop lodging at that time in the house,) "My Lord," said 
 she,, '* O my Lord, make haste unto me:' 5 but as soon as 
 his Lordship came, she expired in his arms, resigning her 
 precious soul into the hands of Almighty Gnd. The cruel 
 
 1 wretch, her husband, was shot by the pursuers ; too good a 
 death for one who deserved the gibbet: and the lady was 
 universally lamented by all tender and religious people. 
 .And this tragical relation I have mentioned,- upon the ac- 
 count of that impulse, or dream, that the clergyman had 
 
 > at Ihe fatal time of the bloody action. 
 
 Some people make a very ill use of the general notion, 
 that there are no apparitions nor spirits at all ; which is 
 
 
 worse than those who fancy they see them upon every oc- 
 casion; for those carry their notions further, even to an- 
 nihilate the devil, and believe noihing about him, neither 
 of one kind or other : the next step they come to, is to 
 conclude, '* There is no God/* and so atheism takes its 
 rise in the same sink, with a carelessness" about futurity- 
 But there is no occasion to enter upon an argument to prove 
 the being of the Almighty, or to illustrate his power by 
 words, who has so many undeniable testimonies in the 
 breasts of every rational being to prove his existence: and 
 we have sufficient proofs enough to convince us of the 
 great supenntendency of Divine Providence in the minutest 
 affairs of this world ; the manifest existence of the invi- 
 sible world ; the reality of spirits, and intelligence between 
 us and them. What J have said, I hope, will not mislead 
 any person, or be a means whereby they may delude them- 
 selves ; for 1 have spoken of these things with the utmost 
 seriousness of mind, and with a sincere and ardent desire 
 for the general good andbenefit of the world.
