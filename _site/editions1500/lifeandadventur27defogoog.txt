LIFE AND ADVENTURES 



OF 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 



I WAS bom in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family, 
though not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, 
who settled first at Hull : he got a good estate by merchandise, and 
leaving off his trade, lived afterward at York ; from whence he had 
married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very 
good family in that country, and from whom 1 was called Robinson 
Kreutznaer ; but, by tlie usual corruption of words in England, 
we are now called — nay, we, call ourselves, and write our name — 
Crusoe ; and so my companions always called me. 

I had two elder brothers, one <»f whom was lieutenant colonel to an 
English regiment of foot in Fianders, formerly commanded by the 
famous Colonel Lockhart. and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk 
against the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never 
k^ew, any more than my father or mother did know what was be* 
come of me. 

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade, my 
head began to be tilled very early with rambling thoughts ; my 
father, who was very ancient, had given me a competent share of 
learning, as far as house education and a country free-school gener- 
ally go, and designed me for the law ; but I would be satisfied with 
nothing but going to sea ; and my inclination to this led me so 
strongly against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and 
against all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other 
friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity of 
nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me. 

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent 
counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one 
morning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and 
expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject : he asked me 



4 BOBINSON CRUSOE. 

wliat reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for 
leaving my father's house and my native country, where I might be 
well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by applica- 
tion and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it 
was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior 
fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by 
enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature 
out of the common road ; and these things were all either too far 
above me, or too far below me : that mine was the middle state, or 
what might be called the upper station of low life, which he had found, 
by long experience, was the best btate in the world, the most suited 
to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the 
labor and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind, and not em- 
barrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper 
'4>ait of mankind. He told me 1 mi^ht judge of the happiness of this 
state by this one thing, viz. , that this was the state of life which all 
other people envied ; that kings have frequently lamented the miser- 
able consequence of being born to great things, and wished they had 
been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean 
and the great ; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the 
standard of felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor 
riches. 

He bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities 
of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind ; but 
that the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed 
to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind ; nay, 
they were not subjected to so many distempers, and uneasiness, 
either of body or mmd, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, 
and extravagances on one hand, or b}' hard labor, want of necessaries, 
and mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distempers 
upon themselves by the natural consequences of their way of living ; 
that the middle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtues 
and all kind of enjoyments ; that peace and plenty were the hand- 
maids of a middle fortune ; that temperance, moderation, quietness, 
health, society, all agreeable divei^ions, and all desirable pleasures, 
were the blessings attending the middle station of life ; that this way 
men went silently and smoothly through the world, and conafortably 
out of it, not embarrassed with the labors of the hands or of the 
head, not sold to a life of slavery for daily bread, nor harassed with 
perplexed circumstances, wliich rob the soul of peace and the body 
of rest ; nor enraged with the passion of envy, or the secret burning 
lust of ambition for great things ; but, in easy circumstances, sliding 
gently through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, 
without the bitter ; feeling that they are happy, and learning by every' 
day's experience to know it more sensibly. 

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate 
manner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into 



ROBlKgOJ^ CRUSOE. 5 

miseries whicli nature, and the fitttion of life I was bora in, seemed 
to have provided against ; that I was under no necessity of seeking 
my bread ; that he would do well for me, and endeavor to enter me 
fairly into the station of life which he had just been recommending 
to me ; and that if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it 
must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it ; and that he 
should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his duty 
in warning me ao:ainst measures which he knew would be to m/ 
hurt ; in a word, that as he would do very kind things for me if I 
would stay and settle at home as he liirected, so he would not have 
so much Jiand in my misfortunes, as to give me any encouragement 
to go away ; and to close all, he told me 1 had my elder brother for 
an example, to wliom he had used the same earnest persuasions to 
keep him from going into the Low Country wars, but could not pre- 
vail, his young desires prompting him to run into the army, where he 
was killed ; and though he said he would not cease to pray for me, 
yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish step 
God would not bless me, and I should have leisure hereafter to reflect 
upon haying neglected his counsel, when there might be none to assist 
in my recovery. 

I observed in this last part of his discourse, whicli was truly pro- 
phetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so himself ; 
I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plentifully, espe- 
cially when he spoke of my brother who was killed ; and that when 
he spoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he 
was so moved that he broke off tlie discourse, and told me his heai't 
was so full he could say no more to me. 

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as indeed who could 
be otherwise ? and 1 resolved not to think of going abroad any more, 
but to settle at home according to my father's desire. But alas I a 
few dajrs wore it all off ; and, in short, to prevent any of my father's 
further importunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away 
from him. However, I did not act quite so hastily as the tirst heat 
of my resolution prompted, but I took my mother at a time when I 
thought her a little more pleasant than ordinary, and told her that 
my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world, tlkut I 
should never settle to anything with resolution enough to go through 
with it, and my father had better give me his consent than force me 
to go without it , that 1 was now eighteen years old, which was too 
late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney ; that I was 
sure if I did I should never serve out my time, but I should certainly 
run away from my master before my time was out, and go to sea ; 
and if she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad, 
if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go no more ; and 
I would promise, by a doable diligence, to recover the time that I 
liad lost. 

This put my mother into a great passion ; she told me she knew y 



f 






6 ROBIlfSON CRUSOE. 

it would be to no purpose lo speak 4x> ipy father upon any such sub- 
ject ; that he knew too well what was my interest to sjive his consent 
to anything so much for ray hurt ; and that she wondered how I 
could think of any such thing after the discourse I had had with my 
fatlier, and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my father 
had used to me ; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there 
was no help for me ; but I might depend I should never have their 
consent to it ; that for her part she would not have so much hand 
in my destruction ; and I should never have it to say that my mother 
was willing when m)' father was not. 

Though my mother refused to name it to my father, yet 1 heard 
afterward, that she reported all the discourse to him, and that my 
father, after showing a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, 
** That boy might be happy if he would stay at home ; but if he goes 
abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born : I 
can give no consent to it.'* 

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, though, 
in the mean time, I contmued obstinately deaf to all proposals of 
settling to business, and frequently expostulated with my father and 
mother about their being so positively detennined against what thev 
knew my inclinations prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, 
whither I went casually, and without any purpose of making an 
elopement at that time ; but, I say, being there, and one of my com- 
panions being going by sea to London in his father's ship, and 
prompting me to go with them, with the common allurement of a 
seafaring man, that it should cost me nothing for my passage^ I con- 
sulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so much as sent them 
word of it ; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, without 
asking God's blessing or my father's, without any consideration of 
circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, Gojd knows, on 
the 1st of September, 1651, I went on board a ship bound for Lon- 
don. Never any young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began 
sooner or continued longer than mine. The Ehip was no sooner got 
out of the Humber than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise 
in a most frightful planner ; and as I had never been at sea before, I 
was most inexpressibly sick in body and terrified in mind. I begao 
now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was 
overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my 
father's house and abandoning my duty. All the good counsels of 
my parents, my father's tears and my mother's entreaties, came now 
fresh into my mind ; and my conscience, which was not yet come to 
the pitch of hardness to which it has come since, reproached me with 
the contempt of advice, and the breach of my duty to God and my 
father. 

All this while the storm increased, and the sea went very high, 
though nothing like what I had seen many times since ; no, nor what 
I saw a few days after ; but it was enough to affect me then, who 



ROBIIhSON CRUSOE. i 

was but a young sailor, and had never known anything of the matter. 
I expected every wave would have swallowed us up, and that every 
time the ship fell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow 
of the sea, we should never rise more : in this agony of mind, I made 
many vows and resolutions, that if it would please God to spare my 
life m this one voyage, if ever I got one© my foot upon dry land 
again, I would go directly home to my father, and never set it into 
a ship again while I lived ; that I would take his advice, and never 
run myself into such miseries as these any more. Now I saw plainly 
the goodness of his observations about the middle station of life, how 
easy, how comfonably he had lived all his days, and never had been 
exposed to tempests at sea, or troubles on shore ; and, in short, I 
resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my 
father. 

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm 
lasted, and indeed some time after ; but the next day the wind 
was abated and the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to 
it ; however, I whs very grave for all that day, being also a little 
sea-sick still ; but toward night the weather cleared up, the wind 
■was quite over, and a charming fine evening followed ; the sun went 
down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning ; and having 
little or no wind and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the 
Mght was, as I thought, the most delightful that ever 1 saw. 

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, but 
very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough 
and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in 
80 little a time after. And now, lest my good resolutions should 
continue, my companion, who had enticed me away, comes to me : 
** Well, Bob," says he, clapping me upon the shoulder, " how do 
you do after it ? 1 warrant you were frighted, wer'n't you, last night, 
when it blew but a capful of wind?'* "A capful d'you call it?" 
said I ; ** 'twas a terrible storifl." ** A storm, you fool you," replies 
he ; ** do you call that a storm ? why, it was nothing at all ; give us 
but a good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a squall 
of wind as that ; but you're but a fresh-water sailor. Bob. Come, 
let us make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that ; d'ye see what 
charming weather 'tis now ?" To make short this sad part of my 
story, we went the way of all sailors ; the punch was made, and I 
was made half drunk with it ; and in that one night's wickedness I 
drowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, 
all my resolutions for the future. In a word, as the sea was returned 
to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the abatement 
of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears and 
apprehensrions of being swallowed up by the sea being forgotten, and 
the current of my former desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows 
and promises that I made in my distress. I found, indeed, some in- 
tervals of reflection ; and the serious thoughts did, as it were, en-

deavor to return again sometimes ; but I shook them off, and roused 
myself from tliem as it were from a distemper, and applying myself 
to drinking and company, soon mastered the return of those lits — for 
so I called them ; and I had in five or six days got as complete a 
victory over my conscience as any young fellow that resolv<}d not to 
be troubled with it could desire. But I was to have another trial for 
it still ; and Providence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved 
to leave me entirely without excuse ; for if I would not take this for a 
deliverauce, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most 
hardened wretch among us would confess both the danger and the 
mercy of. 

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads ; 
the wind having been contrary and the weatlier calm, we had made 
but little way since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to an 
anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, viz., at 
south-west, for seven or eight days, during which time a great many 
ships from Newcastle caipe into the same roads, as the common har- 
bor where the ships might wait for a wind for the river. 

We had not, however, rid here so long, but we should have tided 
it up the river, but that the wind blew loo fresh, and after we had 
lain four or five days, blew very hard. However, the roads being 
reckoned as good as a harbor, the anchorage good, and our ground- 
tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and not in the least 
apprehensive of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after 
the manner of the sea ; but the eighth day, in the morning, the wind 
increased, and we had all hands at work to strike our top-masts, and 
make everything snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy as * 
possible. By noon the sea went very high iQ(U$^ and our ship rode 
forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we though once cr twice our 
anchor had come home ; upon which our master ordered out the 
sheet-anchor, so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables 
veered out to the better end. 

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed ; and now I began to 
see terror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen themselves. 
The master, though vigilant jn the business of preserving the ship, 
yet as he went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear him 
fiofiiy to himself say, several times, " Lord, be merciful to us I we 
shall be all lost ; we shall be all undone !" and the like. During 
these first hurries I was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in 
the steerage, and cannot describe my temper : I could ill resume the 
first penitence which I had so apparently trampled upon, and hard- 
ened myself against : I thought the bitterness of death had been past, 
and that this would be nothing like the first ; but when the master 
himself came by me, as I said Just now, and said we should be all 
lost, I was dreadfully frighted. I got up out of my cabin, and looked 
out ; but such a dismal sight I never saw : the sea ran mountains 
high, and broke upon us every three or four minutes ; when I could 






ROBIXSOiir CRUSOE. 9 

look about, I could see nothing but distress round us ; two ships that 
rode near us, we found, had cut their masts by the board, being deep- 
laden ; and our men cried out that a ship which rode about a mile 
ahead of us was foundered. Two more ships, bein^ driven from 
their anchors, were run out of the roads to sea, at all adventures, and 
that not with a mast standing. The light ships fared the be9t, as not 
so much laboring in the sea ; but two or three of them drove, and 
came close by us, running away with only their spritsail out l:)efore 
the wind. 

Toward evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our 
ship to let them cut away the foremast, which he was very unwilling 
to do ; but the boat swam protesting to him that if he aid not the 
ship would founder, he consented ; and when they had cut away the 
foremast, the mainmast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, 
they were obliged to cut that away also and make a clear deck. 

And one must judge what a condition I must be in at all this, who 
was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright before at 
but a little. But if I can express at this distance the thoughts I had 
about me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon 
account of my former convictions, and the having returned from 
them to the resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at 
death itself ! and these, added to the terror of the storm, put me into 
such a condition that I can by no words describe it. But the worst 
Tvas ixDt come yet ; the storm continued with sueh fury that the 
seamen themselves acknowledged they had never seen a worse. "We 
had a good ship, but she was deep-laden and wallowed in the sea, so 
that the seamen every now and then cried out she would founder. 
It was my advantage in one respect that I did not know what they 
meant hy founder, till I inquired. However, the storm was so vio- 
lent that I saw, what is not often seen, the master, the boatswain, 
and some others more sensible than the rest, at their piayers, and 
expecting every moment when the ship would go to the bottom. In 
the middle of the night, and under all the rest of our distresses, one 
of the men that had been down to see cried out we had sprung a 
leak ; another said there was four feet of water in the hold. Then all 
hands were called to the pump. At that word, my heart, as I thought, 
died within me ; and 1 fell backward upon the side of my bed 
where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men roused me, and told 
me that I, that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to 
pump as another ; at which I stirred up and went to the pump, and 
worked very heartily. While this was doing, the master, seeing 
some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm, were 
obliged to slip, and run away to the sea, and would come near us, 
ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing 
what they meant, thought the ship had broken, or some dreadful 
thing h^pened. In a word, I was so surprised that I fell down in a 
swoon. As this was a time wl^en everybody had his own life to 



10 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

think of, nobody minded me or what was become of me ; but an- 
other man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his 
foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead ; and it was a great while 
before I came to myself. 

We worked on ; but the water increasing in the hold, it was ap- 
parent that the ship would founder ; and though the storm began to 
abate a little, yet as it was not possible she could swim till we mi.4i:ht 
run into any port, so the master continued firing guns for help ; and a 
light ship, who had rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out 
to help us. It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us ; 
but it was impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie 
near the ship's side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and 
venturing their lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the 
stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length, which 
they, after much labor and hazaixl, took hold of, and we hauled them 
close under our stern, ftnd got all into their boat. It was to no pur- 
pose for them or us, after we were in the boat, to think of reaching 
to their own ship ; so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her 
in toward shore as much as we could ; and our master promised 
them that if the boat was staved upon shore, he would make it good 
to th«3ir master ; so partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went 
away to the northward, sloping toward the shore almost as far as 
"Winterton Ness. 

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship 
till we saw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what 
was meant by a ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I 
had hardlv eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sink- 
ing ; for from the moment that they rather put me into the l>oat than 
that I might be said to go in, m^ heart was, as it were, dead within 
me, partly with fright, partly with horror of mind and the thotights 
of what was yet before me. 

While we were in this condition — ^the men yet laboring at the oar 
to bring the boat near the shore — we could see (when, our boat 
mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore) a great many 
people running along the strand, to assist us when we should come 
near ; but we made but slow way toward the shore ; nor were we 
able to reach the shore, till, being past the lighthouse at Winterton, 
the shore falls off to the westward toward Cromer, and so the land 
broke off a little the violence of the wind. Here we got in, and, though 
not without much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked after- 
ward on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we were 
used with great humanity, as well by the magistrates of the town, 
who assigned us good quarters, as by particular merchants and owners 
of ships, and had money given us sufficient to carry us either to 
London or back to Hull, as we thought fit. 

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull and have gone 
home, I had been happy, and my father, as in our blessed Saviour's 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 11 

f arable, had even killed the fatted calf for me ; for hearing the ship 
went away in was cast away in Yarmonih Roads, it was a great 
while before he had any assurances that I was not drowned. 

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing 
could resist ; and though I had several times loud calls from my 
reason and my more composed judgment to go home, yet I had no 
power to do it. I know not what to call this, nor will I urge that it 
is a secret overruling decree, that hurries us on to be the instruments 
of our own destruction, even though it be before us, and that we rush 
upon it with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some such de- 
creed unavoidable misery, which it was impossible for me to escape, 
could have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings and per- 
suasions of my most retired thoughts, and against two such visible 
instructions as I had met with in my first attempt. 

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was 
the master's son, was now less forward than I. The first time he 
spoke to me after we were at Yaimouth, which was not till two or 
three days, for we were separated in the town to several quarters ; I 
say, the first time he saw me, it appeared his tone was altered ; and 
looking very melancholy, and shaking his liead, he asked me how I 
did, and telling his father who I was, and how I had come 1 his voyage 
only for a trial, in order to go farther abroad : his father, turning lo 
me with a very grave and concerned tone, " Young man,*' says he, 
** you ought never to go to sea any more ; you ought to take this for 
a plain and visible token that you are not to be a seafaring man." 
" Why, sir," said I, ** will you go to sea no more ?" " That is an- 
other case," said he ; ** it is my calling, and therefore my duty ; but 
as you maide this voyage for a trial, you see what a taste Heaven has 
given you of what you are to expect if you persist. Perhaps this has 
all befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. 
Pray," continues he, " what are you ? and on what account did you 
go to sea ?" Upon that I told him some of my story ; at the end of 
which he burst out into a strange kind of passion : " What had I 
done," says he, ** that such an unhappy wretch should come into my 
ship ? I would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for 
a thousand pounds." /This indeed was, as I said, an excursion uf his 
spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and was 
farther than he could have authority to go. However, he afterward 
talked very gravely to me, exhorting me to go back to my father, 
and not tempt Providence to my ruin, telling me I might see a visi- 
ble hand 01 Heaven against me. **And, young man," said he, 
** depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever you go, you will 
meet with nothing but disasters and disappointments, till your 
father's words are tulfilled upon you." 

We parted soon after ; for I made him little answer, and I saw 
him no more ; which way he went I knew not. As for me, having 
some money in my pocket, I travelled to London by land ; ana

12 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

there, as well as on the road, had many struggles with myself, what 
course of life I should lake, and whether I should go home or go to 
sea. 

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered to 
my thoughts ; and it immediately occurred to me how I should be 
laughed at among the neighbors, and should be ashamed to see, not 
my father and mother only, but even everybody else ; from whence 
I have since often observed how incongruous and irrational the 
common temper of mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason 
which ought to guide them in such cases, viz., that they are not 
ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent ; not ashamed of the 
action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools, but are 
ashamed of the returning, which only can make them be esteemed 
wise men. 

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain 
what measures to take and what course of life to lead. An irresisti- 
ble reluctance continued to going home ; and as I stayed awhile, the 
remembrance of the distress I had been in wore off ; and as that 
abated, the little motion I had in my desires to return wore off with 
it, till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for 
a voyage. 

That evil influence which carried me first away from my father's 
house — ".which hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of 
raising my fortune, and that impressed those conceits so forcibly 
upon me, as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties 
and even the commands of my father — I say, the same influence, 
whatever it was, presented the most unfortunate of all enterprises to 
my view ; and I went on board a vessel l>ound to the coast of 
Africa, or, as our sailors vulgarly called it, a voyage to Guinea. 

It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did not 
ship myself as a sailor ; when, though I might indeed have worked 
a little harder than ordinary, yet at the same time I should have 
learned the duty and office of a fore-mast man, and in time might 
have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a master. 
But as it was always my fate to choose for the worsw, so I did here ; 
for having money in my pocket and good clothes upon ray back, I 
would always go on board in the habit of a gentleman ; and so I 
Leither had any business in the ship nor learned to do any. 

It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in Lon- 
don, which does not always happen to such loose and misguided 
young fellows as I then was ; the devil generally not omitting to lay 
some snare for them very early ; but it was not so with me. I first 
got acquainted with the master of a ship who had been on the coast 
of Guinea, and who, having had very good success there, was re- 
solved to go again. Tbis captain, taking a fancy to my conversa- 
tion, which was not at all divsagreeable at that time, hearing me say 
I had a mmd to see the world, told me if I would go the voyage with 



liOBIisSON CRUSOE. 13 

him I should be at no expense ; I should be bis messmate and his 
companion ; and if I could carry anything with me, I should have 
all the advantage of it that the trade would admit ; and perhaps I 
migiit meet wilh some encouragement. 

1 embraced the offer ; and entering into a strict friendship with 
this captain, who was an honest, plain-dealing man, 1 went the 
voyage with him, and carried a small adventure witli me, which, by 
the disinterested honesty of my friend the captain, I increased very 
considerably ; for I carried about £40 in such toys and trifles as the 
captain directed me to buy. These £40 I had mustered together by 
the assistance of some of my relations whom I corresponded wilh ; 
and wh'j, I believe, got my father, or at least my mother, iq contrib- 
ute so much as that to my first adventure. 

This was the only voyage which I may say was successful in all 
my adventures, which I owe to the integrity and honesty of my 
friend the captain ; under whom also I got a competent knowledge 
of the mathematics and the rules of navigation, learned how to keep 
an account of the ship's course, take an observation, and, in short, 
to understand some things that were needful to be understood by a 
sailor ; for, as he tooK delight to instruct me, I took delight to learn ; 
and, in a word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant ; 
for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my ad- 
venture, which yielded me in London, at my return, almost £300 ; 
and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have since so 
completed my ruin. 

Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too ; particularly, 
that I WH8 continually sick, being thrown into a violent calenture by 
the excessive heat of the climate ; our principal trading being upon 
the coast, from the latitude of fifteen degrees north even to the line 
itself. 

I was now set up for a Guinea trader ; and my friend, to my great 
misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same voy. 
age again, and I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his 
mate in the former voyage, and had now got the command of the ship. 
This was the unhappiest voyage that ever man made ; for though I 
did not carry quite £100 of my new-gained wealth, so that 1 had 
£200 left, which I had lodged with my friend's widow, who was 
very just to me, yet 1 fell into terrible misfortunes : the first was this 
— our ship, making her course toward the Canary Islands, or rather 
between those Islands and the African shore, was surprised in the 
gray of the morning by a Turkish rover of Sallee, who gave chase to 
us with all the sail she could make. We crowded also as much can- 
vas as our yards would spread or our masts carry to get clear ; but 
finding the pirate gained upon us, and would certainly come up with 
us in a few hours, we prepared to fight ; our ship having twelve 
guns and the rogue eighteen. About three in the afternoon he came 
up with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, 



tM 



14 BOBIKSON CRUSOE. 

instead of athwart our [stern, as he intended, we hrought eight of 
our guns to bear on that side, and poured in a broadside upon him, 
which made him sheer off again, after returning our fire, and pouring 
in also his small shot from near two hundred men which he had oh 
board. However, we had not a man touched, all our men keeping 
close. He prepared to attack us again, and we to defend ourselves ; 
but laying us on board the next time upon our other quarter, he en- 
tered sixty men upon our decks, who immediately fell to cutting and 
hacking the sails and rigging. We plied them with small shot, half- 
pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and cleared our deck of them 
twice. However, to cut short this melancholy part of our story, our 
ship being disabl^ and three of our men killed and eight wounded, 
we were obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into Bailee, 
a port belonging to the Moors. 

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended ; 
nor was I carried up the country to the emperor's court, as the rest 
of our men were, but was kept by the captain of the rover as his 
proper prize, and made his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for 
his business. At this surprising change of my circumstances, from 
a merchant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed ; and 
now I looked back upon my father's prophetic discourse to me, that 
I should be miserable and have none to relieve -me, which I thought 
was now so effectually brought to pass that I .could not be worse ; 
for now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone 
without redemption ; but, alas I this was but a taste of the misery I ' 
was to go through, as will appear in the sequel of this story. 

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his house, so 
I was in hopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea 
again, believing that it would some time or other he his fate to be 
taken by a Spanish or Portuguese man-of-war, and that then I should 
be set at liberty. But this l^pe of mine was soon taken away ; for 
when he went to sea, he left me on shore to look after his little gar- 
den, and do the common drudgery of slaves about his house ; and 
when he came home again from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the 
cabin to look after the ship. 

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method I might 
take to effect it, but found no way that had the least probability in 
it ; nothing presented to make the supposition of it rational ; for I 
had nobody to communicate it to that would embark with me — ^no 
fellow-slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotsman, there but my*- 
self ; so that for two years, though I often pleased myself with the 
imagination, yet I never had the least encouraging prospect of put- 
ting it in practice. 

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself, which 
put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty agsdu 

at home longer than usual without 
heard, was for want of money, he

in my head. Mjr patron lying 
fitting out his ship, which, as 1 



..liS^

used constantly, once or twice a week, sometimes oftener, if the 
weather was fair, to take the ship's pinnace, and go out into the road 
a- fishing ; and, as he always took me and young Maresco with him 
to row the boat, we made him very merry, and I proved very dex- 
terous in catching fish ; insomuch that sometimes he would send me 
w^ith a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth — the Maresco, as 
they called him — to catch a dish of fish for him. 

It happenoxl one time, that going a-fishing in a calm morning, a 
fog rose so thick that, though we were not half a league from the 
shore, we lost sight of it ; and rowing we knew not Whither or which 
way, we labored all day and all the next night ; and when the 
morning came, we found we had pulled off to sea instead of pulling 
in for the shore, and that we were at least two leagues from 
the shore. However, we got well in again, though with a 
^eat deal of labor and some danger ; for the wind began to blow 
pretty fresh in the morning ; but we were all very hungry. 

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more 
care of himself for the future ; and having lying by him the long- 
boat of our English ship that he had taken, he nesolved he would not 
go a-fishing any more without a compass and some provision ; so 
he ordered the carpenter of his ship, who also was an English slave, 
to build a little state-room, or cabin, in the middle of the long-boat, 
like that of a barge, with a place to stand behind it to steer, and haul 
home the main-sheet, and room before for a hand or two to stand 
and work the sails. She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of- 
mutton sail ; and the boom gibed over the top of the cabin, which lay 
verv snug and low, and had in it room for him to lie with a slave or two, 
and a table to eat on, with some small lockers to put in some bottles of 
such liquor as he thought fit to drink, and his bread, rice, and coffee. 

We went frequently out with this boat a-fishing ; and as I was most 
dexterous to catoh fish for him, he never went without me. It hap- 
pened that he had appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure 
or for fish, with two or three Moors of some distinction in that place, 
and for whom he had provided extraordinarily, and had therefore sent 
on board the boat over-night a larger store of provisions than ordi- 
nary ; and had ordered me to get ready three fusees with powder and 
shot, which were on board his ship, for that they designed some 
sport of fowling as well as fishing. 

I ^t all things ready as be had directed, and waited the next 
morning with the boat washed clean, her ancient and pendants out, 
and everytiing to accommodate his guests ; when by and by my pa- 
tron came on board alone, and told me his guests had put off going, 
from some business that fell out, and ordered me, with the man and 
boy, as usual, to go out tvith the boat and catch them some fish, for 
that his friends were to sup at his house ; and commanded that as 
soon as I got some fish I should bring it l^ome to his house : all 
^hich I prepared to d^. 



16 ROBIXSOK CRUSOE. 

This moment, my former notions of deliverance darted into my 
thoughts, for now I found I was likely to have a little ship at my 
command ; and my master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, 
not for fishing business, but for a voyage ; though I knew not, 
neither did I so much as consider, whither I should steer— anywhere 
to get out of that place was my desire. 

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this Moor, 
to get something for our subsistence on board ; for I told him we 
must not presume to eat of our patron's bread. He said tliat was 
true ; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit and tbree jars 
of fresh water into the boat. I knew where my patron's case of 
bottles stood, which it was evident, by the make, were taken out of 
some English prize, and I conveyed them into the boat while the 
Moor was on shore, as if they had been there before fur our master. 
I oonveved also a great lump of beeswax into the boat, which 
weighed above half a hundredweight, with a parcel of twine or 
thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all of which were of great 
use to us afterward, especially the wax to make candles. Another 
trick I tried upon him, which he innocently came into also : his nama 
was Ismael, which they call Muley, or Moely ; so I called to him : 
" Moely/' said I, " our patron's guns are on boanl the boat ; can 
you not get a little powder and shot ? It may be we may kill some 
alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know he keeps 
the gunner's stores in the ship." "Yes," says he, "I'll bring 
some ;" and accordinghr he brought a great leather pouch, which 
held a pound and a hslt of powder, or rather more -, and another 
with shot, that had five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put 
all into the boat. At the same tune, I had found some powder of 
my master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one of the lar^c 
bottles in the case, which was almost empty, pouring what was in it 
into another ; and thus furnished with everything needful, we sailed 
out of the port to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the 
port, knew who we were, and took no notice of us ; and we were 
!not above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail, and set 
us down to fish. The wind blew from the N.N.E., which was con- 
trary to my desire, for had it blown southerly, I had been sure to 
have made the coast of Spain, and at least reached to the Bay of 
Cadiz ; but my resolutions were, blow which way it would, I would 
be gone from that horrid place where I was, and leave the rest to fate. 

After we had fished some time and caught nothing — ^for when I 
had fish on my hook I would not pull them up, that he might not see 
them— I said to tho Moor, " This will u.-t do ; oiic master will not be 
thus served ; we must stand farther off." Uc, thinking no harm, 
agreed, and being in the head of the boat, set the sails ; and, as I had 
the helm, I run the boat out near a league farther, and then brought 
her to as if I would fish ; when, giving the boy the helm, I steeped 
lurward to where the Moor was, and making as if I stoopea for 



BOBII^^SOK CRUSOE. 17 

something behind him, I took him by surprise with my arm under 
his waist, and tossed him clear overboard into the sea. He ruse 
immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called to me, begged to 
be taken in, told me he would go all over the world with me. He 
swam so strong after the boat, that he would have reached me very 
quickly, there being but little wind ; upon which I stepped into the 
cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I presented it at him, 
and told him I had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I 
would do him none. "But," said I, "you swim well enough to 
reach to the shore, and the sea is calm ; make the best of your way 
to shore, and I will do you no haim ; but if you come near the boat, 
I'll shoot you through the head, for I am resolved to have my 
liberty :'* so he turned himself about, and swam for the shore, and I 
make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for he was an excellent 
swimmer. 

I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and 
have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. 
When he was gone, I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, 
and said to him, " Xury, if you will be faithful to me, I'll make you 
a great man ; but if you will not stroke your face to be true to me" 
— that is, swear by Mahomet and his father's beard — " I must throw 
you into the sea too." The boy smiled in my face, and spoke so in- 
nocently that I could not distrust him, and swore to be faithful to 
me, and go all over the world with me. 

While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood out 
directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward, that they 
might think me gone toward the strait's moulh (as indeed any one 
that had been in their wits must have been supposed to do) ; for who 
would have supposed we were sailed on to the southward to the truly 
Barbarian coast, wliere whole nations of negroes were sure to sur- 
round us with their canoes and destroy us ; where we could not go 
on shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts, or more merci- 
less savages of human kind ? 

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course, 
and steered directly south and by east, bending my course a little 
toward the east, that I might keep in with the shore ; and having a 
fair, fresh gale of wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I made such sail 
that I believe by the next day at three o'clock in the afternoon, when 
I first made the land, I could not be less than one hundred and fifty 
miles south of Sallee ; quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's domin- 
ions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts, for we saw no people. 

Yet such was -the fright I h^ taken of the Moors, and the dread- 
ful apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that I would not 
stop, or go on shore, or come to an anchor ; the wind continuing fair 
till I hud sailed in that manner five days ; and then the wind sh&ting 
to the southward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels were in 
chase of me, they also would now give over ; so I ventured to make 



18 ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 

to the coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I 
knew not what nor where ; neither what latitude, what country, what 
nation, or what river. I neither saw nor desired to see any people ; 
the principal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek 
in the evening, resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, 
and discover the country ; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard 
such dreadful noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild 
creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready 
to die with fear, and begged of me not to go on shore till day. 
** Well, Xury," said I, '* then I won't ; but it may be we may see 
men by day w^ho will be as bad to us as those lions/' ** Then we 
give them the shoot gun," says Xury, laughing; "make them 
lun wey." Such English Xury spoke by conversing among us 
blaves. However, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave 
him a dram (out of our patron's case of bottles) to cheer him up. 
After all, Xury*s advice was good, and I took it : we dropped our 
little anchor, and lay still all night ; I say still, for we slept none ; 
for in two or three hours we saw vast great creatures (we knew not 
what to call them) of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore and 
run into the water, wallowing and washing themselves for the pleas- 
ure of cooling themselves ; and they made such hideous bowlings 
and yellings, that I never indeed heard the like. 

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too ; but we 
were both more frighted when we heard one of these mighty creat- 
ures come swimming toward our boat ; we could not see him, but 
we might hear him by his blowing to l)e a monstrous huge and furious 
beast. Xury said it was a lion, and it might be so for aught I know ; 
but poor Xury cried to me to weigh the anchor and row away. 
*' No," says I, " Xury ; we can slip our cable, yith the buoy to it, 
and go off to sea ; they cannot follow us far. " Fhad no sooner said 
so but I perceived the creature (whatever it was) within two oars* 
length, which something feurprised me ; however, I immediately 
stepped to the cabin-door, and taking up my gun, fired at him ; upon 
which he immediately turned about and swam toward the shore 
again. 

But it is impossible to describe the horrid noises and hideous cries 
and bowlines that were raised, as well upon the edge of the shore 
as higher within the country, upon the noise or report of the gun — a 
thing I have some reason to believe those creatures had never heard 
before : this convinced me that there was no going on shore for us in 
the night on that coast, and how to venture on shore in the day was 
another question too ; for to have fallen into the hands of any of the 
savages had been as bad as to have fallen into the hands of the lions 
and tigers ; at least we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it. 

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or 
other for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat ; when or 
where to get it was the point. Xury said, if I would let him go oni 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 19 

shore with one of the jars, he would find if there was any water, 
and bring some to me. I asked him why he would go; wliy I 
should not go, and he stay in the boat. The boy answered with so 
much affection as made me love him ever after. Says he, '* If wild 
mans come, they eat me, you go wey." "Well, Xury," said 1, 
** we will both go, and if the wild mans come, we will kill them, 
they shall eat neither of us." So I gave Xury a piece of rusk bread 
to eat, and a dram out of our patron's case of bottles which I mention- 
ed before ; and we hauled the boat in as near the shore as we thought 
was proper, and so waded. on shore, carrying nothing but our arms 
and two jars for water. 

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming of 
canoes with savages down the river ; but the boy, seeing a low place 
about a mile up the country, rambled to it, and by and by I saw him 
come running toward me. Khought he was pursued by some savage or 
frighted with some wild beast, and I tmi forward toward him to help 
him ; but when I came nearer to him, 1 saw something hanging over 
his shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, l^ut 
different in color, and longer legs ; however, we were very glad of it, 
and it was very good meat ; but the great joy that poor Xury came 
with was to tell me he had found good water, and seen no wild 
mans. 

But we found afterward that we need not take such pains for 
water, for a liltle higher up the creek where we were we found the 
water fresh when the tide was out, which flowed but a little way 
up ; so we filled our jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed, and 
prepared to go on our way, having seen no footsteps of any human 
creature in that part of the country. 

As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very well 
that the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Yerd Islands also, 
lay not far off from the coast. But as I had no instruments to take 
an observation to know what latitude we were in, and not exactly 
knowing, or at least remembering, what latitude they were in, I knew 
not where to look for them or when to stand off to sea toward them ; 
otherwise I might now easily have found some of these islands. But 
my hope was, that if I stood along this coast till I came to that part 
where the English traded, I should find some of their vessels upon 
their usual design of trade, that would relieve and take us in. 

By the best of my calculation, that place where I now was must 
be that country which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco's 
dominions and the negroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by 
wild beasts ; the negroes having abandoned it, and gone farther 
south, for fear of the Moors ; and the Moors not thinking it worth 
inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness ; and, indeed, both forsaking 
it because of the prodigious numbers of tigers, lions, leopards, and 
other furious creatures which harbor there ; so that the Moors use it 
for their himting only, where they go like an army, two or three 



1: ^-H- 



20 ROBINSON CKL'SOE. 

thousand men at a time : and, indeed, for near a hundred miles to- 
gether upon this coast, we saw nothing but a waste, uninhabited 
country by day, and heard nothing but how lings and roaring of wild 
beasts by night. 

Once or twice in the daytime I thought I saw the Pico of Tene- 
riffe, bein^ the high top of the Mountain Teneriffe in the Caiiarles ; 
and had a great mind to venture out, in hopes of reaching thither ; 
but having tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the 
sea also going too high for my little vessel ; so I resolved to pursue 
my first design and keep along the shore. 

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had 
left this place, and once in particular, being early in the morning, 
we came to an anchor under a little point of land, which was pretty 
high ; and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in. 
Xury, whose eyes were more about him than it seems mine were, 
calls softly to me, and tells m^ that we had best go farther off the 
shore ; ** for,'* says he, ** look, yonder lies a dreadful monster on the 
side of that hillock, fast asleep." I looked where he pointed, and 
saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was a terrible great lion that 
lay on the side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill 
that hung as it were a little over him. ** Xury," sa^'s 1, ** you shall 
go on shore and kill him." Xury looked frighted, and said, **Me 
kill ! he eat me at one mouth ;" one mouthful he meant. However, 
I said no more to the boy but bade him lie si ill, and I took our big- 
gest gun, which was almost musket bore, and loaded it with a good 
charge of powder and with two slugs, and laid it down ; then I 
loaded another gun with two bullets ; and the third (for we had three 
pieces) I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best aim I 
could with the first piece to have shot him in the head, but he lay so 
with his leg raised a little above his nose that the slugs hit his leg 
about the knee and broke the bone. He started up, growling at first, 
but finding his leg broken, fell do>vn again ; and then got iip upon 
three legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was 
a little surprised that I had not hit him on the head ; however, I 
took up the second piece immediately, and though he began to move 
off, fired again, and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to see 
him drop and make but little noise, but lie struggling for life. Th^n 
Xury took heart, and would have me let him go on shore. " "Well, 
go, said I : so the boy jumped into the water, and taking a little 
gun in one hand, swam to shore with the other hand, and coming close 
to the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him 
in the head again, which dispatched him quite. 

This was game indeed to us, but this was no food ; and I was very 
sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that 
was good for nothing to us. However, Xury said he would have 
some of him ; so he comes on board, and asked me to give him the' 
hatchet. '* For what, Xury ?" said I. " Me cut off his head," said 



^ *, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 21 

he. However, Xury could not cut oflf his head, but he cut off a foot, 
and brought it with him, and it was a monstrous great one. 

I bethought myst^lf, however, that perhaps tlie skin of him might, 
one way or other, be of some value to us ; and I reserved to take off 
his skin if I could. 80 Xury and I went to work with him ; but 
Xury was much the better workman at it, for I knew very ill how to 
do it. Indeed, it look us both up the whole day, but at last we got 
off tlie hide, and spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun eflecta- 
ally dried it in two days' time, and it afterward served me to lie upon. 

After this we made on to the southward continually for ten or 
twelve days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which began to 
abate very much, and going no oftener to the shore than we were 
obliged for fresh water. My design in this was to make the River 
Gambia or Senegal — that is to say, anywhere about the Cape de 
Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some European ship ; and 
if I did not, I knew not what course I had to take, but to seek for 
the islands, or perish there among the negroes. I knew that all the 
ships from Europe which sailed either to the coast of Guinea or to 
Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this cape or those islands ; and, 
in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this single point, 
either that I must meet with some ship or must perish. 

When 1 had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as I 
have said, I began to see that the land was inhabited ; and in two or 
three places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to 
look at us ; we could also perceive they were quite black and naked. 
I was once inclined to have gone on shore to them ; but Xury was 
my better counsellor, and said to me, '* No go, no go." However, I 
hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk to them, and 1 found 
they, ran along the shore by me a good way : I observed they had no 
weapons in their hands, except one, who had a long slender stick, 
which Xury said was a lance, and that they could throw them a 
great way with good aim ; so I kept at a distance, but talked with 
them by signs as well as I could ; and particularly made signs for 
something to eat : they beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they 
would fetch me some meat. Upon this I lowered the top of my sail 
and lay by, and two of them ran up into the country, and in less than 
half an hour came back, and brought with them two pieces of dry 
flesh and some corn, such as is the produce of their country ; but 
we neither knew what the one or the other was : however, we were 
willing to accept it ; but how to come at it was our next dispute, for 
I would not venture on shore to them, and they were as much afraid 
of us : but they took a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the 
shore and laid it down, and went and stood a great way off till we 
fetched it on board, and then came close to us again. 

"We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make 
them amends ; but nn oppori unity offered that very instant to oblige 
them wonderfully : for whde we were lying by the shore, came two 



22 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

mighty creatui-es, one pursuing llie other (as we took it) with great 
fury from the mountains toward the sea ; whether It waji the male 
pursuing the female, or whether they were in sport or in rage, we 
could net tell, any more than we could U'll whether it was usual or 
strange, but I believe it Was the latter; because, in the first place, 
those ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night ; and, in the 
second place, we found the people terribly frighted, especially the 
women. The man that had the lance or dart did not fly from them, 
but the rest did ; however, as the two creatures ran directly into the 
water, they did not offer to fall upon any of the negroes, but plunged 
themselves into the sea and swam about, as if they had come for 
their diversion : at last one of them began to come nearer our boat 
than at first I expected ; but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded my 
gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury load both the others. 
As soon as he came fairly within my reach, I firf d, and shot him 
directly in the head : immediately he sank down into the water, but 
rose instantly and plunged up and down, as if he was sti uggling for 
life, and so indeed he was : he immediately made to the shore ; but 
between the wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of 
the water, he died just before he reached the shore. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures 
at the noise and fire of my gun ; some of thtm were even ready to 
die for fear, and fell down as dead with the very terror ; but when 
they saw the creature dead and sunk in the water, and that I made 
signs to them to come to the shore, they took heart and came, and 
began to search for the creature. I found him by his blood staining 
tiie 'Water ; and by the help of a rope, which I slung round him, and 
gave the negroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that 
it was a most curious leopard, spotted, and fine to tin admirable de- 
gree ; and the negroes held up their hands with admiration to think 
what it was I had killed him with. 

The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and the noise of 
the gtm, swam on the shore, and ran up directly to the mountains 
from whence they came ; nor could I, at that distance, know what it 
was. I found quickly the negroes wished to eat the flesh of this 
creature, so I was willing to have them take it as a favor from me ; 
which, when I made signs to them that they might take him, they 
were very thankful for! Immediately they fell to work with him ; 
and though they had no knife, yet with a sharpened piece of wood 
they took off his skin as readily, and much more readily, than we 
could have done with a knife. They offered me some of the flesh, 
which I declined, pointing out that I would give it them ; but made 
signs for the skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought me 
a great deal more of their provisions, which, though I did not under- 
stand, vet I accepted. I then made signs to them for some water, 
and held out one of my jars to them, turning it bottom upward, to 
show that jt was empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. They 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 23 

called immediately to some of their frienda^ and there came two 
women, and brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I 
supposed, in the sun ; this they set down to me, as before, and I sent 
Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them all three. The women 
were as naked as the men. 

I was now furnished with roots -and com, such as it was, and 
water ; and leaving my friendly negroes, I made forward for about 
eleven days more, without offering to go near the shore, till I saw 
the laud run out a great length into the sea, at about the distance of 
four or five leagues before me ; and the sea being very calm, I kept 
a large offing to make this point. At length, doubling the point, at 
about two leagues from the land, I saw plainly land on the other side, 
to seaward : then I concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that 
this was the Cape de Verd, and those the islands called, from thence. 
Cape de Verd Islands. However, they were at a great distance, and 
I could not well tell what I had best to do ; for if I should be taken 
with a fresh of wind, I might neither reach one or other. 

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the cabin 
and sat down, Xury having the helm ; when, on a sudden, the boy 
cried out, '' Master, master, a ship with a sail !'* and the foolish boy 
was frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his 
master's ships sent to pursue us, but 1 knew we were far enough out 
of their reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and immediatelv saw, 
not only the ship, but that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I 
thought, was bound to the coast of Guinea, for negroes. But when I 
observed the course she steered, 1 was soon convinced they were 
bound some other way, and did not design to come any nearer to the 
shore : upon which I stretched out to sea as much as I could, resolv- 
ing to speak with them if possible. 

With all the sail I could make, I found- 1 should not be able to 
come in their way, but that they would be gone by before I could 
make any signal to them : but after I had crowded to the utmost, and 
began to despair, they, it seems, saw, by the help of their glasses, that 
it was some European boat, which they supposed must belong to 
some ship that was lost ; so they shortened sail to let me come up. 
I was encouraged with this, and as I had mv patron's ancient on 
board, I made a waft of it to them, for a signal of distress, and fired 
a gun, both which they saw ; for they told me they saw the smoke, 
though they did not hear the g§n. Upon these signals they very 
kindly brought to and lay by for me ; and in about three hours' time 
I came up with them. 

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in 
French, but I understood none of them ; but at last, a Scotch sailor, 
who was on board, called to me : and I answered him, and told him 
1 was an Englishman, that I had made my escape out of slavery from 
the Moors, at Sallee ; they then bade me come on board, and very 
kmdly took me in and all my goods. 



r 



24 BOBINSON CRUSOE. 

It was an inexpressible joy to me, "which any one will believe, that 
I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable and 
almost hopeless condition as I was in ; and I immediately offered all 
I had to the captain of the ship, as a return for my deliverance ; but 
he generously told me he would take nothing from me, but that all 
I had should be delivered safe to me when I came to the Brazils. 
** For," says he, "I have saved your life on no other terms than I 
would be glad to be saved myself ; and it may, one time or other, 
be my lot to be taken up in the same condition. Besides." said he, 
** when I cany you to the Brazils, so great a way from your own 
country, if I should take from you what you have, you will be 
starved there, and then I only take away that life I have given. Ko, 
no," says he ; *' Seignor Inglese " (Mr. Englishman), " 1 will carry 
you thither in charity, and those things will help to buy your subsist- 
ence there, and your passage home again." 

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the per- 
formance to a tittle ; for he ordered the seamen, that none should 
touch anything that I had : then he took everything into his own 
possession, and gave me back an exact inventory of them, that I 
might have them, even to my three earthen jars. 

As to my boat, it was a very good one ; and that he saw, and told 
me he would buy it of me for his ship's use ; and asked me what I 
would have for it. I told him he had been so generous to me in 
everything, that I could not offer to make any price of the boat, but 
left it entirely to him : upon which he told me he would give- me a 
note of hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil ; and 
when it came there, if any one offered to give more, he would mi^e 
it up. He offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy 
Xury, which I was loath to take ; not that I was unwilling to let the 
captain have him, but 1 was very loath to sell the poor boy's liberty, 
who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own. However, 
when I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just, and offered 
mc this medium, that he would give the boy an obligation to set him 
free in ten years, if he turned Christian : upon this, and Xury saying 
he was willing to go to him, I let the captain have him. 

We had a veiy good voyage to the Brazils, and I arrived in the 
Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, in about twenty-two 
days after. And now I was once more delivered from the most mis- 
erable of all conditions of life ; adti what to do next with myself I 
was to consider. 

The generous treatment the captain gave me I can never enough 
remember : he would take nothing of me for my passage, gave me 
twenty ducats for the leopard's skin and forty for the lion's skin, 
which I had in my boat, and caused everything I had in the ship to 
be punctually delivered to me ; and what I was willing to sell he 
bought of me ; such as the case of bottles, two of my guns, and a 
piece of the lump of beeswax— for I had made candles of the rest: 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 25 

in a word, I made about two hundred and twenty pieces of eight of 
all my cargo ; and with this stock I went on shore in the Brazils. 

I had not been long here before I was recommended to the house 
of a good, honest man, like himself, who had an ingenio, as they call 
it (that is, a plantation and a sugar-house). 1 lived with him some 
time, and acquainted myself, by that means, with the manner of 
planting and making of sugar ; and seeing how well the planters 
lived, and how they got rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could get a 
license to settle there, I would turn planter among them ; resolving, 
in the mean time, to find out some way to get my money, which I 
had left in London, remitted to me. To this purpose, getting a 
kind of letter of naturalization, I purchased as much land that was un- 
cured as my money would reach, and formed a plan for my planta- 
tion and settlement ; such a one as might be suitable to the stock 
which I proposed to myself to receive from England. 

I had a neighbor, a Portuguese, of Lis!>on, but born of English 

rirents, whose name was "Wells, and in much such circumstances as 
was. I call him my neighbor, because his plantation lay next to 
mine, and we went on very sociably together. My stock was but 
low, as well as his ; and we rather planted for food than anything 
else, for about two years. However, we began to increase, and our 
land began to come into order ; so that the third year we planted 
some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground ready for 
planting canes in the year to come : but we both wanted help ; and 
now I found, more than before, I had done wrong in parting with 
my boy Xury. 

But, alas I for me to do wmng, that never did right, was no great 
wonder, I had no remedy but to go on . I had got into an employ- 
ment quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I 
delighted in, and for which I forsook my father's house, and broke 
through all his good advice ; nay. I was coming into the veiy middle 
station, or upper degree of low life, which my father advised me to 
before, and which, if I resolved to go on with. I might as well have 
stayed at home, and never have fatigued myself in the world, as I had 
done ; and I used often to say to myself, 1 could have done this as 
well in England, among my friends, as have gone five thousand miles 
off to do it among strangers and savages, in a wilderness, and at such 
a distance as never to hear from any part of the world that had the 
least knowledge of me. 

In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the utmost 
regret. I had nobody to converse with but now and then this neigh- 
bor ; no work to be done but by the labor of my hands ; and I used 
to say, I li vcd just like a man cast away upon some desolate island, that 
had nobody there but himself. But how just has it been ; and how 
should all men reflect, that when they compare their present condi- 
tions with others that are worse. Heaven may oblige them to make 
the exchange, and be convinced of their former felicity by their ex* 






26 • ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

perience : I say, how just has it been that the truly solitary life I 
reflected on, in an island of mere desolation, should be my lot, who 
had so often unjustly compared it with the life which I then led, in 
which, had I continued, I had, in all probability, been exceeding 
prosperous and rich. 

I was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying on the 
plantation before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took 
me up at sea, went back ; for the ship remained there, in providing 
his lading and preparing for his voyage, nearly three months ; when, 
telling him what little stock I had left behind me in London, be gave 
me this friendly and sincere advice : " Seignor Inglese," says he (for 
so he always called me), " if you will give me letters, and a procura- 
tion in form to me, with orders to the person who has your money in 
London, to send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall 
direct, and in such goods as are proper for this country-, I will bring 
you the produce of them, God willing, at my return ; but, since 
human anairs are all subject to changes and disasters, I would liave 
you ^ive orders but for one hundred pounds sterling, which, you 
say, IS half your stock, and' let the hazard be run for the first ; so 
that, if it come safe, you may order the lest the same way ; and, if it 
miscarry, you may have the other half to have recourse to for your 
supply." 

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I could 
not but be convinced it was the best course I could take ; so I accord- 
ingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my 
money, and a procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he desired. 

I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all my ad-* 
ventures ; my slavery, escape, and how 1 had met with the Portu- 
guese captain at sea, the humanity of his bt^havior, and what condi- 
tion I was now in, with all other necessary directions for my supply ; 
and when this honest captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by 
some of the English merchants there, to send over, not the order 
only, but a full account of my story to a merchant at Loudon, who 
represented it effectually to her ; whereupon she not only delivered 
the money, but, out of her own pocket, sent the Portuguese captain 
a very handsome present for his humanity and charity to me. 

The merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds in English 
goods, such as the captain had written for, sent them directly to him 
at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to the Brazils ; among 
which, without my direction (for I was too young in my business to 
think of them), he had taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron 
work, and utensils, necessary for my plantation, and which were of 
great use to me. 

When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune n^ade, for I was 
surprised with the joy of it ; and my gooa steward, the captain, had 
laid out the five pounds, which my friend had sent him for a present 
for himself, to purchase and bring me over a servant, under bond for 



-J 



ROBTNSOK CRUSOE. 27 

six years* service, and would not accept of any consideration, except 
a little tobacco, which I would have him accept, being of my own 
produce. 

Neither was this all ; for my ^oods being all English manufacture, 
sucli as cloths, stuffs, baize, and things particularly valuable and de- 
sirable in the country, I found means to sell them to a very great ad- 
vantage ; so that 1 might say I had more than four times the value 
of my first cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbor 
— I mean in the advancement of my plantation ; for the first thing I 
did, I bought me a negro slave, and a European servant also — I mean 
another besides that which the captain brought me from Lisbon. 

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of our 
greatest adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next year with 
great success in my plantation : I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco 
on my own ground, more than I had disposed of for necessaries among 
my neighbors ; and these fifty rolls, being each of above a hundred- 
weight, were well cured, and laid by against the return of the fleet 
from Lisbon : and now increasing in business and in wealth, my 
head began to be full of projects and undertakings beyond my reach ; 
such as are, indeed, often the ruin of the best heads in business. 
Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had room for all the 
happy things to have yet befallen me, for which my father so ear- 
nestly recommended a quiet, retired life, and which he had so sensibly 
described the middle station of life to be full of ; but other things 
attended me, and I was still to be the wilful agent of all my own 
miseries ; and, particularl3% to increase my fault, and double the re- 
flections upon myself, which in my future sorrows I should have 
leisure to make, all these miscarriages were procured by my appar- 
ent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering abroad, 
and pursuing that inclination, in contradiction to the clearest views 
of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects 
and those measures of life which nutui*e and Providence concurred 
to present me with and to make my duty. 

As I had once done thus in my breaking away from my parents, so 
I could not be content now, but I mui.t go and leave the happy view 
I had of being a rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only 
to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster than the 
nature of the thing admitted ; and thus I cast myself down again 
into the deepest gulf of human misery that ever man fell into, or per- 
haps could be consistent with life and a state of health in the world. 

To come, then, by just degrees, to the particulars of this part 
of my story : You may suppose, that having now lived almost four 
years in the Brazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well 
upon my plantation, I had not only learned the language, but had 
contracted acquaintance and friendship among my fellow-planters, 
as well as among the merchants at St. Salvador, which was our 
port ; and that, in my discourses among them, I had frequently given 



f 



28 ROBINSON^ CRUSOE. 

them an account of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea ; the 
manner of trading with the negroes there, and how easy it was to 
purchase upon the coast for trifles — such as beads, toys, knives, 
scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like— not only gold-dust, 
Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, etc., but negroes, for the service of 
the Brazils, in u;reat numbers. 

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on these 
heads, but especially to that part which related to the buying 
negroes ; which was a trade, at that time, not only not far entered 
into, but, as far as it was, had been carried on bv assientos, or per- 
' mission of the kin^s of Spain and Portugal, and engrossed in the 
public stock ; so that few negroes were bought, and those exces- 
sively dear. 

It happened, being in company with some merchants and planters 
of mj^ acquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly, three 
of them came to me the next morning, and told me they had been 
musing very much upon what I had discoursed with them of the last 
ni^ht, and they came to make a secret proposal to me ; and, after 
enjoining me secrecy, they tokl me that they had a mind to fit out a 
ship to go to Guinea ; that they had all plantations as well as 1, and 
were straitened for nothing so much as servants ; that as it wtis a 
trade that could not be carried on, becau*^ they could not publicly 
sell the negroes when they came hoihe, so they desired to make but 
one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore privrftely, and divide them 
among their own plantations ; and, in a word, the question was, 
whether I would go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trad- 
ing part upon the coast of Guinea ; and they offered me that I should 
have my equal share of the negroes, without providing any part of 
the stock. 

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been made 
to any one that had not had a settlement and a plantation of his own 
to look after, which was in a fair wa^ of coming to be very consid- 
erable, and with a good stock upon it. But for me, that was thus 
entered and established, and had nothing to do but- to go on as I had 
begun, for three or four years more, and to have sent for the other 
hundred pounds from England ; and who in that time, and with 
that little addition, could scarce have failed of being worth three or 
four thousand pounds sterling, and that increasing too— for me to 
think of such a voyage was the most preposterous thing that ever 
man in such circumstances could be guilty of. 

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more resist 
the offer than I could restrain my first rambling designs, when my 
father's good counsel was lost upon me. In n word, I told them I 
would go with all my heart, if they would undertake to look after 
my plantation in my absence, and would dispose^ of it to such as I 
should direct, if I miscarried. This they all engaged to do, and 
entered into writings or covenants to do so ; and 1 made a formal 



ROBINSON €RUSOE. 29 

will, disposing of my plantation and effects in case of my death, 
making ihe captain of the ship that had saved my life, as before, my 
universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of my effects as I had 
directed in my will ; one half of the produce being to himself, and 
the other to be shipped to England. 

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects, and to 
keep up my plantation : had I used half as much prudence to have 
looked into my own interest, and have made a judirment of what I 
ought to have done and not to have done, I had cerlaiuly never gone 
away from so prosperous an undertaking, leaving all the probable 
views of a thriving circumstauce, and gone upon a voyage to sea, 
attended with all its common hazards, to say nothing of the reasons 
1 had to expect particular misfortunes to myself. 

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy 
ratlier than my reason ; and, accordingly, the ship being fitted out, 
and the cargo furnished, and all things done, as by agreement, by my 
partners in the voyage, I went on board in an evil hour, the 1st of 
September, 1659, being the same day eight years that I went from 
my father and mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their 
authority, and the fool to my own inter.ests. 

- Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, carried 
six guns and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, and myself ; 
we had on board no large c^rgo of goods except of such toys a^ were 
lit for our trade with the negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, 
and other trilles, especially little loolung-glasses, knives, scissors, 
hatchets, and the like. 

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the 
northward upon our own coast, with design to stretch over for the 
African coast, when we came about ten or twelve degrees of north- 
ern latitude, which, it seems, was the manner of course in those 
days. We had very good weather, only excessively hot, all the way 
upon our own coast, till we came to the height of Cape St. Augus- 
tine ; from whence, keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight of land, 
and steered as if we were bound for the Isle Fernando Ue Noronha, 
holding our course N. E. by N., and leaving those isles on the east. 
In this course we passed the line in about twelve days' time, and 
were, by our last observation, in seven degrees twenty- two minutes 
northern latitude, when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us 
quite out of our knowledge. It began from the south-east, came 
about to the north-west, and then settled in the north-east ; from 
whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for twelve days 
together we could do nothing but drive, and, scudding away before 
it, let it carry us whither ever fate and the fury of the winds direct- 
ed ; and. during these twelve days, I need not say that I expected 
every day to be swallowed up ; nor, indeed, did any in the ship 
«xpect to save their lives. 

In this ilistress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of our 



30 ROBINSOK CEtJSOE. 

men die of tlie calenture, and one man and the boy washed over- 
board. About the twelfth day, the weather abating a little, t^e mas- 
ter made an observation as well as he could, and found that be was 
in about eleven degrees north latitude, but that he was' twenty- two 
degrees of longitude difference west from Cape St. Augustine ; so 
that he found he was upon the coast of Guiana, or the north part of 
Brazil, beyond the River Amazons, toward that of the Kiver Oroo- 
noque, commonly called the Great River ; and began to consult with 
me what course he should take, for the ship was leaky, and verv 
much disabled, and he was going directly back to the coast of Brazil. 

I was positively against that ; ancV looking over the charts of the 
sea-coast of America with*him, we concluded there was no inhabited 
country for us to have recourse to, till we came within the circle of 
the Caribbee Islands, and therefore resolved to stand away for Bar- 
badoes ; which, by keeping off to sea. to avoid the indraft of the Bay 
or Gulf of Mexico, we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about 
fifteen days* sail ; whereas we could not possibly make our voyage 
to the coast of Africa without some assistance both to our ship and 
to ourselves. 

With this design, we changed our course, and steered away N. W. 
hy W., in order to reach some of our English islands, where I hoped 
for relief ; but our voyage was otherwise determined ; for, being in 
the latitude of twelve degrees eighteen minutes, a second storm came 
upon us, which carried us away with the same impetuosity west- 
ward, and drove us so out of the way of all human commerce, that 
had all our lives been saved as to the sea we were rather in danger of 
being devoiu*ed by savages than ever returning to our own country. 

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men 
early in the morning cried out, " Land !" and we had no sooner run 
out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world 
we were, than the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her mo- 
tion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner that 
we expected that we should all have perished immediately ; and we 
were immediately driven into our close quarters, to shelter us from 
the very foam and spray of the sea. 

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like condition to 
describe or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances. 
We knew nothing where we were, or upon what land it was we were 
driven ; whether an island or the main — whether inhabited or not in- 
habited ; and as the rage of the wind was still great, though rather less 
than at first, we could" not so much as hope to have the ship hold 
many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the winds, by a 
kind of miracle, should turn immediately about. In a word, we sat 
looking upon one another, and expecting death every moment^ and 
every man, accordingly, preparing for another world ; for there was 
little or nothing more for us to do in this ; that which was our pres- 
ent comfort, and all the comfort we had, was that, contrary to our 




ROBIK^SON CRUSOE, 31 

expectation, the ship did not break yet, and that the master said the 
wind began to abate. 

Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, yet the 
ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for us 
to expect her getting off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed, 
and had nothing to do but to think of saving our lives as well as we 
could. We had a boat at our stern just before the storm, but she 
was first staved bv dashing against the ship's rudder, and in llio 
next place she broke away, and either sunk or was driven off to 
sea; so there was no hope from her. "We had another boat on board, 
but how to get her off into the sea was a doubtful thing ; however, 
there was no time to debate, for we fancied the ship would break in 
pieces every minute, and some told us she was actually broken 
already. 

In this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat, and 
with the help of the rest of the men, got her slung over the ship's 
side ; and getting all into her, let go, and committed ourselves, bemg 
eleven in number, to God's mercy and the wild sea ; for though the 
storm was abated considerably, yet the sea ran dreadfully high upon 
the shore, and might be well called den wild zee, as the Dutch call the 
sea in a storm. 

And now our case was very dismal indeed ; for we all saw plainly 
that the sea went so high that the boat could not live, and that we 
should be inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none, nor, if 
we had, could we have done anything with it ; so we worked at the 
oar toward the land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to 
execution ; for we all knew that when the boat came nearer the 
shore, she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach of the 
sea. However, we committed our souls to God in the most earnest 
manner ; and the wind driving us toward the shore, we hastened 
our destruction with our own hands, pulling as well as we could 
toward land. 

What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal, 
we knew not ; the only hope that could rationally give us the least 
shadow of expectation, was, if we might find some bay or gulf, or 
the mouth of some river, where by great chance we might have run 
our boat in, or^ot under the lee of the lapd, and perhaps made 
smooth water. But there was nothing like this appeared ; but as we 
made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more frightful 
than the sea. 

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a half, 
as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling astern 
of us, and plainly bade us expect the coup de grace. In a word, it 
took us with such a fury that it overset the boat at once ; and sepa- 
rating us, as well from the boat as from one another, gave us not 
time to say, *' O God I" for we were all swallowed up in a moment. 

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt when 



32 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

I sunk into the water ; for thougU I swam very well, yet I could not 
deliver myself from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave 
having driven me, or rather carried m-, a vast way on toward the 
sliore, arid having spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land 
almost dry, but half dead with the water I took in. I hud so much 
pi esence of mind as well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the 
mainland than I expected, I got upon my feet, and endeavored to 
make on toward the land as fast as I could, before another wave 
should return and take me up again ; but I soon found it was im- 
possible to avoid it ; for I saw the sea come after mc as high as a 
great hill, and as furious as an enemy, which I had no means or 
strength to contend with : my business was to hold my breath, and 
raise myself upon the water, if I could ; and so, by swimming, to 
preserve my breathing aud pilot myself toward the shore, if possi- 
ble ; my greatest concern now being, that the sea, as it would carry 
me a great way toward the shore when it came on, might not carry 
me back again with it when it gave back towaid the sea. 

The wave that came upon me again, buried me at once twenty or 
thirty feet deep in its own body, and I could feel myself carried with 
a mighty force and swiftness toward the shore a very great way ; but 
I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still forward with all 
my might. I was ready to burst with holding my breath, when as I 
felt myself rising up. so, to my immediate relief, I found my head 
and hands shoot out above the surface of the water ; and though it 
was not two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it 
relieved me greatly, gave me breath and new couraj^e. I was cov-^" 
ered again with water a good while, but not so long but I held it* 
out ; and finding the water had spent itself, and began to return, I 
struck forward against the return of the waves, and felt ground 
again with my feet. I stood still a few moments to recover breath, 
and till the waters went from me, and then took to my heels and ran, 
with what strength 1 had, farther toward the shore. But neither 
would this deliver me from the fury of the sea, which came pouring 
in after me again ; and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and 
carried forward as before, the shore being very flat 

The last time of these two had well-nigh been fatal to me ; for the 
sea having hurried me along, as before, landed me, or rather dashed 
me, against a piece of a rock, and that with such force as it left me 
senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance ; for the 
blow taking my side and breast, beat the breath, as it were, quite out 
of my body ; and had it returned again immediately, I must have 
been strangled in the water ; but I recovered a little before the return 
of the waves, and seeing I should be covered again witji the water, I 
resolved to hold fast bf a piece of the rock, and so to hold my 
breath, if posible, till the wave went back. Now, as the waves were 
not so high as at first, being nearer land, I held my hold till the wave 
abated, and then fetched another run, which brought me so near the 



z.

KOBINSON ORUaOE, 33 

shore, that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did nf»t so 
swallow me up as to carry me away ; and the next run I took I got 
to the mainland ; where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the 
cliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from dan- 
ger, and quite out of the reach of the water. 

I was now landed and safe on shore, and began to look up and' 
thank God that my life wj^ saved, in a case wherein there was, 
some minutes before, scarce any room to hope. 1 believe it is impos- 
sible to express to the lite what the ecstasies and transports of tiie 
soul are when it is so sav^, as I may say, out of the very grave ; 
and I do not wonder now at the custom, when a malefactor, who has 
the halter about his neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned off, 
and has a reprieve brought to him ; I say, I do not wonder that thev 
bring a surgeon with it, to let him blooa that very moment they tell 
him o^t, that the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from the 
jieart, and overwhelm him. 



*« 



For sadden joys, like griefs, confound at first." 



I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands ; and my whole 
being, as I may say, wiapt up in a contemplation of my deliverance ; 
making a thousand gestures and motions, which I cannot describe ; 
reflecting upon all my comrades that were drowned, and that there 
should not be one soul saved but myself ; for, as for them, I never 
saw them afterward, or any sign of them, except three of thdr hats, 
'one cap, and two shoes that were not fellows. 

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and froth of 
the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far off ; and con- ^ 

sidered, Lord ! how was it possible I could get on shore ? \ 

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my con- 
dition, I beg^n to look round me, to see what kind of place I was in, 
and what was next to be done : and I soon found my comforts abate, . 
and that, in a word, I bad a dreadful deliverance : for 1 was wet, 
had no clothes to shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink, to 
comfort me ; neither did I see any prospect before me but that of 
perishing with hunger or being devoured by wild beasts : and that 
which was particularly afflicting to me was, that I had no weapon, 
either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or to defend 
myself against any other creature that might desire to kill me for 
theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco- 
pipe, and a little tobacco in a box. This was all my provision ; and 
this threw me into terrible agonies of mind, that for a while I ran 
About like a madman. Night coming upon me, 1 began, with a 
heavy heart, to consider what would be my lot if there were any 
' ravenous beasts in that country, as at night they always come abroad 
for their prey. 

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts, at that time, was to 
get up into a thick bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny, which grew 

K. c— » »

/ near me, und where I resolved to sit all nigbt, and consider the next 
day what death I should die, for as yet 1 saw no prospect of life. I 
walked about a furlong from the shore, to see if I could find any 
fresh water to drink, which I did to my great joy ; and having 
drank, and put a little tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I 
went to the tree, and getting up into it, endeavored to place myself 
so that if I should sleep I might not fall ; and having cut me a 
short stick, like a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging ; 
and having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as 
comfortably as, I belie ve^ few could have done in my condition, and 
found myself more refreshed with it than, 1 think, I ever was on 
such an occasion. 

When I waked it was broad day, the weather cleiir, and the storm 
abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before ; but that 
which surprised me most was, that the ship was lifted off in the 
night from the sand where she lay, by the swelling of the tidfe, and 
was driven up almost as far as the rock which I first mentioned, 
where I had been so bruised by the wave dashing me against'it. This 
being within about a mile trom the shore where I was, and the ship 
seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself on board, that at 
least I might save some necessary things for my use. 

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked about 
me again, and the first thing I found was the boat, which lay, as the 
wind and sea had tossed her up upon the land, about two miles on 
my right hand. J walked as far as I could upon the shore to have* 

fot to her ; but found a neck, or inlet, of water between me and the 
oat which was about half a mile broad ; so I came back for the 
present, being more intent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to 
find something for my present subsistence. 

A little after noon, I found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed 
so far out that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship. 
And here I found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evi- 
dently that if we had kept on board, we had been all safe : that is 
to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable 
as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and company, as I now 
was. This forced tears to my eyes again ; but as there was little re- 
lief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship ; so I pulled off 
my clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, and took the 
water. But When I came to the ship, my diflSculty was still greater 
to know how to get on board ; for, as she lay aground, and high out 
of the water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I 
swam round her twice, and the second time I spied a small piece of 
rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hung down by the 
forechains so low, that with great diflBculty I got hold of it, and by 
the help of that rope I got up into the forecastle of the ship. Hei-e I 
found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her 
hold ; but that she lay soon the side of a bank of hard sand» or rather 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 85 

earth, that her stern lay lifted up upon the hank, and her head low, al- 
most to the water. By this means all her quarter was free, and all that 
was in that part was dry ; for you may be sure my first work was to 
search and to see what was spoiled and what was free. And, first, I 
found that all the ship's provisions were dry and untouched by the 
water, and being very well disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room, 
and filled my pockets witli biscuit, and ate it as I went about other 
things, for I had no lime to lose. I also found some rum in the grerit 
cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I had. indeed, nec'l 
enough of to spirit me for what was before me. Now I wanted 
nothing but a boat, to furnish myself with many things which I fore- 
saw would be very necessary to me. 

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had ; 
and this extremity routed my application. We had several spare 
yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast or 
two in the ship : I resolved to fall to work with these, and 1 fiun^ as 
many of them overboard as I could manage for their weljcrbt, tying 
every one with a rope, that they might not drive away. When this 
was done, I went down the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I 
tied four of them together at both ends, as well as I could, in the 
form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plauk upon 
them, crossways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it 
was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces bemg too light. So 
I went to work, and with the carpenter's saw I cut a spare top-mast 
into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with a great deal of 
labor and pains, but the hope of furnishing myself with necessaries 
encouraged me to go beyond what I shoufd have been able to have 
done upon another occasion. 

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight. 
My next care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I 
laid upon it from the surf of the sea : but I was not long considering 
this. I first laid all the plank or boards upon it that I could get, and 
having considered well what I most wanted, I first got three of the 
seamen's chests, which I had broken open and emptied, and lowered 
them down upon my raft ; the first of these 1 filled with provisions, 
viz., bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's flesh 
(which we lived much upon), and a little remainder of European 
corn, which had been laid by for some fowls which we brought to 
sea with us, but the fowls were killed. There had been some barley 
and wheat together ; but to my great disappointment, I found after- 
ward that the lats had eaten or spoiled it all. As tor liquors, I 
found several cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which 
were some cordial waters ; and, in all, about five or six gallons of 
rack. These I stowed by themselves, there being no need to put 
them into the chest, nor any room for them. While I was doing 
this, I found the tide began to flow, though very calm ; and I had 
the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had 



86 BOBINSOK CRUSOE* 

left on the shore, upon the sand, swim away. As for my breeches, 
which were only lineo, and open-knc;ed, I swam on board in them 
and my stockings. However, this set me on rummaging for clothei^, of 
wliich I found enough, but took no more than I wanted for present 
use, for 1 had other things which my eye was more upon ; as, first, 
tools to work with on shore. And it was after long searching that 
I found out the carpenter's chest, which was, indeed, a very useful 
prize to me, and much more valuable than a ship lading of gold 
would have been at that time. I got it down to ray raft, whole as it 
was, without losing time to look into it, for I knew in general what it 
contained. 

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There were 
two very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols. 
These I secured first, with some powder-horns and a small bag of 
shot, and two old rusty swords. I knew there were three ban'els of 
powder in the ship, but knew not where our gunner had stowed 
them ; but with much search I found them, two of them dry and 
good, the third had taken water. Those two I got to my mft, with 
the arms. And now I thought myself pretty well freighted, and be- 
gan to think how 1 should get to shore with them, having neither sail, 
oar, nor rudder ; and the least capful of wind would have overset all 
my navigation. 

1 had three encouragements : 1st, a smooth, calm sea ; 2dly, the 
tide rising, and setting m to the shore ; 8dly, what little wind tliere 
was blew me toward the land. And thus, having found two or 
three broken oars belonging to the boat, and besides the tools which 
were in the chest, two saws, an axe, and a hammer, with this cargo I 
put to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very well, only 
that I found it drive a little distant from the place wiiere I had 
landed l)efore ; by which I perceived that there wa.s some indraft of 
the water, and, consequently, I hoped to find some creek or river 
theie. which I might make use of as a port to get to land with my 
cargo. 

As I imagined, so it was. There appeared before me a little opening 
of the land, and I found a strong current of the tide set into it ; so i 
guided my raft, as well as I could, to keep in the middle of the stream. 
But here I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if 
I had, I think, verily, would have broken my heart ; for, knowing 
nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a 
shoal, and not bein^ aground at the other end, it wanted but a little 
that all my cargo had slipped off toward the end that was afloat, 
and so fallen*into the water. I did my utmost, by setting my back 
against the chests, to keep them in their places, but could not thrust 
off the raft with all my strength ; neither durst I stir fromlpie pos- 
ture I was in ; but holcling up the chests with all my might, I stood 
in that manner near half an hour, in which time the rising of the 
water brought me a little more upon a level ; and, a little after, the 



. ->•: 1 



ROBINSOiS^ CRUSOE. 37 

water stilt rising, mj raft floated again, and I thrust her off with the 
oar I had into the channel, and then driving up lifgher, I at length 
found myself in the mouth of a little river, with land on both sides, 
and a strong current or tide running up. I looked on both sides for 
a proper place to get to shore, for 1 was not willing to be driven too 
high up the river : hoping, in time, to see some ship at sea, and there^ 
fore resolved to place myself as near the coast as I could. 

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to 
which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my raft, and at last 

got so near tiiat, reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her 
irectly in. But here I bad like to have dipped all my cargo into 
the sea again ; for that shore lying pretty steep — that is to say slop- 
ing — there was no place to lana, but where one end of my float, if it 
ran on shore, would lie so high, and the^ other sink lower, as before, 
that it would endanger my cargo again. All that I could do was to 
wait till the tide wan at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar 
like an anchor, to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat 
piece of ground, which I expected the water would flow over ; and 
so it did. As soon as I found water enough, for my raft drew about 
a foot of water, I thrust her on upon that flat piece of ground, and 
there fastened or moored her, by slicking my two broken oars into the 
ground — one on one side, near one end, and one on the other side, 
near the other end ; and thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and 
left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore. 

My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper place for 
my habitation, and where to stow my goods, to secure them from 
whatever might happen. Where I was, I yet knew not ; whether 
on the continent or an island ; whether inhabited or not inhabited ; 
whether in danger of wild beasts or not. There was a hill not above 
a mile from me, which rose up very steep and high, and which seemini 
to overtop some other hills> which lay as in a ridge from it, north- 
ward. I took out one of the fowling-pieces, and one of the pistols, 
and a horn of powder ; and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up 
to the top of that hill, where, after I had with great labor and aiffl- 
culty gai to the top, I saw my fate, to my great affliction, viz. , that I 
was in an island environed on every side by the sea : no land to be 
seen except some rocks, which lay a great way off ; and two small 
islands less than this, which lay about three leagues to the west. 

I found also that the islana I was in was barren, and, as I saw 
good reason to believe, uninhabited except by wild beasts, of whom, 
however, I saw none. Yet I saw abundance of fowls, but I knew 
not their kinds ; neither, when I killed them, could I tell what was 
fit for food and what not. At my coming back, I shot at a great 
bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree, on the side of a great wood. 
I believe it was the flrst gua^that had been fired there since the crea- 
tion of the world. I had no sooner fired than from all the parts of 
■the wood there arose an innumerable number of fowls, of many 



38 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

sorts, making a confused screaming and crying, every one according 
to his usual nolo, but not one of tliem of any kind that I knew. As 
for the creatuie I kilJed, I took it to be a kind of a hawk, its color 
and beak resembling it, but it had no talons or claws more than com- 
mon. Its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing. 

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and fell to 
work to bring my cargo on shore^ which took me up the rest of that 
day : what to do with mygelf at night I knew not, nor indeed where 
to rest, for I was afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but 
some wild beast might devour me, though, as I afterward found, 
there was really no need for those fears. 

However, as well as I could, I barricaded myself round with the 
chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and made a kind of 
hut for that night's lodging. As for food, I yet saw not which way 
to supply myself, except that I had seen two or three creatures, like 
hares, run out of the wood where I Fhot the fowl. 

I now began to consider that I might 3'et get a great many things 
out of the ship which would be useful to me, and particularly some 
of the rigging and sails, and such other things as might <;ome to 
land ; andl resolved to make another voyage on board the vessel, if 
possible. And as 1 knew that the first storm that blew must neces- 
sarily break her all in pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart, 
till I had got everything out of the ship Ihat I could get. Then I 
called a council — ^that is to say, in my thoughts— whether I should 
take back the raft ; but this appeared impracticable ; so I resolved 
to go as before, when the tide was down ; and I did so, only that I 
stripped before I went from my hut, having nothing on but a check- 
ered shirt, a pair of linen drawers, and a pair of pumps on my 
feet. 

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second raft ; and, 
having had experience of the first, 1 neither made this so unwieldy 
nnr loaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several things very useful 
to me ; as, first, in the carpenter's stores, 1 found two or three bags 
full of nails and spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatch- 
ets, and, above all, that most useful thing called a grindstone. AH 
these I secured, together with several things belonging to the gunner, 
particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of musket 
bullets, seven muskets, and another fowling-piece, with some small 
quantity of powder more ; a large bagful of small shot and a great 
roll of sheet-lead ; but this last was so heavy I could not hoist it up 
to get it over the ship's side. 

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could find, 
and a spare foretop-sail, a hammock, and some bedding ; and with 
this I loaded my second raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to 
my very great comfort. 

I was under some apprehension, during my absence from the land, 
that at least my provisions might be devoured on shore ; but when.1 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 39 

came back, I found no sign of any visitor ; only there sat a creature 
like a wild cat, upon one of the chests, which, when 1 came toward 
it, ran away a little distance, and then stood still. She sat very com- 
posed and unconcerned, and looked fall in my face, as if she had a 
mind to be acquainted with me. I presented my gun to her, but, as 
she did not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor 
did she offer to Htir away ; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, 
though, by the way, I was not very free of it, for my store was not 
great : however, I spared her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled 
at it, and ate it, and looked (us if pleased) for more ; but I thanked 
her, and could spare no more : so she marched off. 

Having got my second cargo on shore — though I was obliged to 
open the barrels of powder, and lH*ing them by parcels, for thev were 
too heavy, being large casks — I went to work to make me a little tent 
with the sail and some poles which I cut ,for that purpose ; and into 
this tent I brought everything that I knew would spoil either with 
rain or sun ; and I piled all the empty chests and casks up in a circle 
round the tent to fortify it from any sudden attempt, either from 
man or beast. 

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with 
some boards within, and an empty chest set up on end without ; and 
spreading one of the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols 
just at my head, and my gun at length by roc, I went to bed for the 
first time, and slept very quietly all night, for I was very weary and 
heavy ; for the night before I had slept little, and had labored very 
hard all day, to fetch all those things from tho ship, and to get them 
on shore. 

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid up, 
I believe, for one man ; but I was not satisfied still, for while the 
ship sat upright in that posture, I thought I ought to get everything 
out of her that I could ; so everyday, at low water, I went on board, 
and brought away something or other ; but particularly the third 
time I went, I brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as 
also all the small ropes and rope twine I could get, with a piece of 
spare canvas, which was to mend the sails upon occasion, and the 
barrel of wet gunpowder. In a word, I brought away all the sails 
first and last ; only that I was obliged to cut them m pieces, and 
bring as much at a time as I could, for they were no more useful to 
be sails, but as mere canvas only. 

But that w^hich comforted me more still was, that last of all, after 
I had made five or six such voyages as these, and thought I had noth- 
ing more to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with 
—I say, after all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, three large 
runlets of rum, or spirits, and a box of sugar, and a barrel of line 
flour : this was surprising to me, because I had given over expect- 
ing any more provisions, except what was spoiled by the water. I 
Boon emptied the hogshead of the bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by 



40 



ROBINSON CKUSOE. 



parcel, in pieces of the sails, 'which I cut out ; and, in a word, I got 
all this safe on shore also. 

The next day I made another voyage, and now, having plundered 
the ship of what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with tho 
cables : cutting the great cable into pieces such as I c^uld move, I 
got two cables and a hawser on shore, with all the iron work I 
could get ; and having cut down the spritsail-yard, and the mizzen- 
yard, and everything I could, to make a large raft, I loaded it with 
all these heavy goods, and came away ; but mv good luck began 
now to leave me ; fur this raft was so unwieldy and so overladen 
that after I was entered the little cove where I had landed the rest of 
my goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it 
overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the water ; as for my- 
self, it was no great harm, for I was near the shore ; but as to my 
cargo, it was a great part of it lost, especially the iron, which 1 ex- 
pected would have been of 'great use to me : however, when the tide 
was out, I got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and some of the 
iron, though with infinite labor ; for I had to dip for it into the wa* 
ter, a work which fatigued me very much. After this, I went every 
day on board, and brought away what I could get. 

1 had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven times 
on board the ship, in which time I had brought away all that one 

Sair of hands could well be supposed capable to bring ; thougli I be- 
eve veril3% had the calm weather held, I should have brought away 
the whole ship, piece by piece ; but preparing the twelfth lime to go 
on board, I found the wind began to rise ; however, at low water I 
went on board, and though I thought I had rummaged the cabin so 
effectually that nothing more could \^e found, yet 1 discovered a 
locker with drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three 
razors and one pair of large scissors, with some ten or a dozen of 
good knives and forks ; in another I found about thirty-six pounds 
value in money — some European coin, some Brazil, some pieces of 
eight, some gold, and some silver. 

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money : " O drug I" said I 
aloud, " what art thou good for? Thou art not worth to me — no, 
not the taking off the ground : one of those knives is worth all this 
heap : I have no manner of use for thee ; e'en remain where thou 
art, and go to the bottom, as a creature whose life is not worth sav* 
ing." However, upon second thoughts I took it away ; and wrap- 
ping all in a piece of canvas, I began to think of making another 
raft : but while 1 was preparii^g this, I found the skj' overcast, and 
the wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh 
gale from the shore. It presently occurred to me that it was in vain 
to pretend to make a raft with the wind off shore ; and that it was 
my business to be gone before the tide of flood began, otherwise I 
might not be able to reach the shore at all. Accordingly, I let my- 
self down into the water, and swam across the channel which lay lie- 



HOBINSOK CRtJSOE. 41 

tween the sbip and the sands, and even that with difficulty enough, 
partly with the weight of the things I had about me, and partly from 
the roughness of the water ; for the wind rose very hastily, and be- 
fore it was quite high water it blew a storm. 

But •!• had got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all my 
wealth about me, very secure. It blew very hard all that night, and 
in the morning, when I looked out, behola no more ship was to be 
seen ! I was a little surprised, but recovered myself with this satis- 
factory reflection, that I had l<>8t no time, nor abated any diliarence, 
to get everything out of her that could be useful to me ; and that in- 
deed there was little left in her that I was able to bring away if 1 had 
had more time. 

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of anything 
out of her, except what might drive on shore from her wretjk ; as, 
indeed, divers pieces of her afterward did ; but those things were of 
small use to me. 

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself 
against either savages, if any should appear, vbr wild beai^s, if any 
were in the island ; and I had many thoughts of the method how to 
do this, and what kind of dwelling to make, whether I should make 
me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon the earth ; and, in short, I 
Besolved upon both ; the manner and description of which, it may 
not be improper to give an account of. 

I soon foimd the place I was in was not fit for my settlement, be- 
cause it was upon a low, moorish ground, near the sea, and I be- 
lieved it would not be wholesome, and more particulai-ly because 
there was no fresh water near it ; so I resolved to llnd a more healthy 
and more convenient spot of ground. 

I consulted several things in my situation, which I found would 
be proper for me ; 1st, health and fre^ water, I just now men- 
tioned ; 3dly, shelter from the heat of the sun ; 8dly, security from 
ravenous creatures, whether men or beasts ; 4thly, a view to tne sea, 
that if God sent any ship in sight, I might not lose any advantage for 
my deliverance, of which I was not willing to banish all my expec- 
tation yet. 

In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on the 
side of a rising hill, whose front toward this little plain was steep as 
a house-side, so that nothing could come down upon me from the 
top. On^the side of the rock there was a hollow place, worn a little 
way in, like the entrance or door of a cave ; but there was not really 
any cave, or way into the rock at all 

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I resolved to 
pitch my tent. This plain was not above a hundred yards broad, 
fmd about twice as long, and lay like a green before my door ; and, 
at the end of it, descended irregularly every way down into the low 
ground by the sea-side. It was on the N. N". W . side of the hill ; so 
that it was sheltered from the beat every day, till it came to a W. 



4:2 ROBINSON CEUSOB. 

and by S. sun, or thereabouts, which, in those countries, is near the 
setting. 

Before I set up my tent I drew a half-circle before the hollow 
place, which took in about ten yards in its serai-diameter, from the 
rock, and twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning and end- 
ing. 

In this half -circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving 
them into the ground till tliey stpod very firm like piles, the biggest 
end being out of the ground above five feet and a half, and sharpened 
on tlie top. The two rows did not stand above six inches from one 
another. 

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, and 
laid them in rows, one upon another, within the circle, between 
these rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside,, 
leaning against them, about two feet and a half high, like a spur to 
a post ; and this fence was so strong that neither man nor beast 
could get into it or over it. This cost me a great deal of time and 
labor, especially to cut the piles in the woods, bring them to the 
place, and drive them into the earth. 

The entrance into this place 1 made to be, not by a door, but by a 
short ladder to go over the top ; which ladder, when I was in, I 
lifted over after me ; and so I was completely fenced in and fortified, 
as I thought, from all the world, and consequently slept secure in 
the night, which otherwise I could not have done ; though, as it ap- 
peared afterward, there was no need of all this caution from the 
enemies that I apprehended danger from 

Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labor, I carried all my 
riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which you 
have the account above ; and I made a large tent, which, to preserve 
me from the rains, that in one part of the year are very violent there, 
I made double, one smaller tent within and one larger tent above it ; 
•and covered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had saved 
among the sails. 

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had brought 
on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very good one. and 
belonged to the mate of the ship. 

Into this tent I brought all my provisions and everything that 
would spoil by the wet ; and having thus inclosed all nay goods, I 
made up the entrance, which till now I had left open, and so passed 
and repassed, as I said, by a short ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, and 
bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down out through my 
tent, I laid them up within my fence, in the nature of a terrace, so 
that it raised the ground within about a foot and a half ; and thus I 
made me a cave, just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar 
to my bouse. 

It cost me much labor and many days before all these things were 






ROBIifSON' CRUSOE. 45 

brQU<»:ht to perfection ; and, therefore, I must go back to some other 
things which look up some of my thoughts. At the same time it 
happened, after I had laid my scheme for the setting up my tent and 
making the cave, that a storm of rain falling from a thick, dark 
cloud, a sudden flash of lightning happened, and after that a great 
clap of thunder, as is naturally the effect of it. I was not so much 
surprised with the lightning as I was with a thought which darted 
into my mind as swift as the lightning itself : O my powder I My 
very heart sank within me when I thought that, at one blast, all my 
powder might be destroyed ; on which, not my defence only, but. the 
providing me food, as I thought, entirely depended. I wjis nothing 
near so anxious about my own danger, though, had the powder took 
fire, I should never have known who had hurt me. 
. Such impression did this make upon me, that after the storm waa 
over, I laid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, and ap- 
plied myself to make bags and boxes, to separate the powder, and to 
keep it a little and a little in a parcel, in hope that v/hatever might 
come, it mi^ht not all take fire at once ; and to keep it so apart, that 
it should not be possible to make one part fire another. I finished 
this work in about a fortnight ; and I think my powder, which in all 
was about two hundred and forty pounds weight, was divided into 
not less than a hundred parcels. As to the barrel that had been w et, 
I did not apprehend any danger from that ; so I placed it in my new 
cave, which, in my fancy. I called my kitchen ; and the rest I hid 
up and down in holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come to 
it, marking very carefully where I laid it. 

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out once at 
least every day with mv gun, as well to diveit myself as to see if I 
could kill anythins: fit fur food ; and, as near as I could, to acquaint 
myself with what the island produced. The first time I went out, I 
presently discovered that there were goats in the island, which was a 
great satisfaction to me ; but then it was attended with this misfor- 
tune to me, viz., that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of 
foot, that it was the difficultest thing in the world to come at them ; 
but I was not discouraged at this, not doubting but I night now and 
then shoot one, as it soon happened ; for after I had found their 
haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for them : I observed if 
they saw me in the valleys, thoui^h they were upon the rocks, they 
would run away, as in a terrible fright : but if they were feeding in 
the valleys, and 1 was upon the rocks, they took no notice of mo ; 
from whence I concluded that, by the position of their optics, their 
sight was so directed downward, that they did not readily see objects 
that were above them ; so afterward, I took this method — I always 
climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then had frequently a 
fidr mark. 

The first shot I made among these creatures. I killed a she-goat, 
which had. a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, wliich grieved 



r

44 EOBINSON CRUSOE. 

me heartily ; for, when th*^ old one fell, the kid stood stock still by 
her, till I came and took her up ; and not only so. but when I curried 
the old one with me, upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite 
to my inclosure ; upon whjch I laid down the dam and look the 
kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have it bred 
up tame ; but it would not eat ; so I was forced to kill it, and ate 
it myself. These two supplied me with flesh a great while, for I ate 
sparingly, and saved my provisions, my bread especially, as much as 
possibly I could. 

Havmg now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely necessary to 
provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn ; and what I did 
for that, as also how I enlarged my cave, and wha*; conveniences I 
made, I shall give a full account of in its place ; but I must now give 
some little account of myself, and of my thoughts about living, 
which, it may well be supposed, were not a few. 

I had a dismal prospect of my condition, for as I was not ca^ 
away upon that island without being driven, as is said, by a violent 
storm, quite out of the course of our intended voyage, and a great 
way, viz., some hundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary course of 
the trade of mankind, I had great reason to consider it as a deter< 
mination of Heaven that in this desolate place, and in this desolate 
manner, I should end my life. The tears would run plentifully 
down my face when I made these reflections ; and sometimes I 
would expostulate with myself why Providence should thus com- 
pletely ruin its creatures, and render them so absolutely miserable ; 
so without help, abandoned, so entii-ely depressed, that it could 
hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life. 

But something always returned swift upon me to check these 
thoughts and to reprove me ; and particularly, one day walking with 
my gim in my hand, by the sea-side, I was very pensive upon the 
subject of my present condition, when reason, as it were, expostu- 
lated with me the other way, thus : ** Well, you are in a desolate 
condition, it is true ; but, pray remember, where are the rest of 
you? Did not you come eleven of you inio the boat? Where are 
the ten ? Wfcy were not they saved, and you lost ? Why were you 
singled out ? Is it better to be here or there ?" And then I pointed 
to the sea. All evils are to be considered with the good that is in 
them, and with what worse attends them. 

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for my 
subsistence, and what would have been my case if it had not hap- 
pened (which was a hundred thousand to one) that the ship fioeted 
from the place where she tlrst struck, and was driven so near ij the 
shore that I had time to get all these things out of her ; what would 
have been my case, if I had been forced to have lived in the cfuxdi- 
tion in which I at first came on shore, without necessaries of life, or 
necessaries to supply and procure them? "Particularly/* said I, 
aloud (though to myself), '' what should I have done without a gun. 



EOBINSON CEUSOE. 45 

without ammunition, without any tools to make anything, or to 
work with, without clothes, hedding, a tent, or any manner of cover- 
ing f and that now I had all these to sufficfent quantity, and was in 
a fair way to provide myself in such a manner as to live without my 
gUn, when my ammunition was spent : so that I had a tolerable view 
of subsisting, without any want, as long as I lived ; for I considered, 
from the beginning, how I would provide for the accidents that 
might happen and for the time that was to come, even not only after 
my ammunition should be spent, but even after my health and 
stiength should decay. • 

I confess I had not entertained any notion of my ammunition be- 
ing destroyed at one blast— I mean my powder being blown up by 
lightning ; and this made the thoughts of it so surprising to me, 
when it lightened and thundered, as 1 observed just now. 

And now being to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of 
silent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the world before, 
I shall take it from its beginning, and continue it in its order. It 
was, by my account, the 30th of Sep^.ember, when, in the manner as 
above said, I first set foot upon this horrid island ; when the sun, 
being lo us in its autumnal equinox, was almost just over my head : 
for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the latitude of nine 
degrees twenty-two minutes north of the line. 

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into my 
thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of books, 
and pen and ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days ; but to 
prevent this, I cut with my knife upon a large post, in capital let. 
ters ; and making it into a great cross, I set up on the shore where I 
first landed, *' I came on shore here on the 80th of ^ptember, 1659." 

Upon the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch with 
my knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and 
every first day of the month as long again as that long one ; and thus 
I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of 
time. 

In the next place, we are to observe that among the many things 
which I brought out of the ahip, in the several voyages which, as 
above mentioned, I made to it, I got several things of less value, but 
&ot at aJl less useful to me, which I omitted setting down before ; as, 
in particular, pens, ink, and paper ; several parcels in the capt in's, 
mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping ; three or four compas'^cs, 
some mathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books 
of navigation ; all which [ huddled together, whether I might want 
them or no : also I found three very good Bibles, which came to me 
in my cargo from England, and which I had packed up among my 
thin^ ; some Portuguese books also ; and, among ihem, two or three 
Popish prayer-lkooks, and several other bo(^s, all which I carefnl^j' so- 
cured. And I must not forget that we had in the ship a dog and isvo 
cats^ of whose eminent history I may have occasion to say somclhing 



46 EOBINSOX CRUSOE. 

in its place ; for I carried both the cats with me ; and as for the dog, 
he jumped out of the ship of himself, and swam od shore to me the 
day after I went on shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty ser- 
vant to me many years ; I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, 
nor any company that he could make up to me ; I only wanted to 
have him talk to me, but that would not do. A.s I observed before, 
I found pens, ink, and paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost ; 
and 1 shall show that while my ink lasted I kept things very exact, 
but after that was gone 1 could not, for I could not make any ink by 
any means that I could devise. 

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwith- 
standing all that 1 had amassed together ; and of these ink was one ; 
as also a spade, pickaxe,' and shovel, to dig or remove the earth ; 
needles, pins, and thread : as for linen, I soon learned to want that 
without much difficulty. 

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily ; and it was 
near a whole year before I had entirely finished my little pale, or sur- 
rounded my habitation. The piles or stakes, which were as heavy as 
1 could well lift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in the 
woods, and more, by far, in bringing home ; so that I spent some- 
times two days in cutting and bringing home one of those posts, and 
a third day in driving it into the ground ; for which purpose 1 got a 
heavy piece of wood at first, but at last bethought myself of one of 
the iron crows ; which, however, though 1 found it) made driving 
those posts or piles very laborious and tedious work. But what 
need I have l>een concerned at the tediousness of anything I had to 
do, seeing I had time enough to do it in ? nor had I any other em- 
ployment, if that had been over, at least that I could foresee, except 
the ranging the island to seek for food, which I did more or less 
every day. 

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and. the circum-» 
stances I was reduced to ; and I drew up the state of my affairs in 
writing, not so much to leave them to any that were to come after 
me, for I was likely to have but few heirs, as to deliver my thoughts 
from daily poring upon them and afflicting my mind : and as my 
reason began now to master my despondency. I began to comfort 
myself as well as I could, and to set the good against the evil, that I 
might have something to distinguish my case from worse ; and I stated 
very impartially, like debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed 
against the miseries I suffered, thus .* 



Evil. Good. 

I am cast upon a horrible, des- But I am alive ; and not 

olate island, void of all hope of drowned, as oil my ship's com- 

recoveiy. paqy were.

47 



Evil. 

I am singled out and separated, 
-as it were,1from all the world, to 
1)6 miserable. 



I am dinded from mankind— 
a solitaire ; one banished from 
human society. 

I have not clothes to co^cr me. 



I am without any defence, or 
means to resist any violence of 
man or beast. 



I ha^re no soul to speak to or 
relieve me. 



Good. 

But I am singled out, too, from 
all the ship's crew, to be spared 
fiom death ; and He that mirac- 
ulously saved me from death 
can deliver me from this condi- 
tion. 

But I am not starved and per- 
ish inj? on a barren place afford- 
ing nu sustenance. 

But 1 am in a ho^ climate, 
where, if I liad clothes, I could 
haidly wear them. 

But I am cast on an island 
where I see no wild beasts to 
hurt me, as I saw on the coast of 
Africa : and what if I had been 
shipwrecked there ? 

But God wonderfully sent the 
ship in near enough to the shore, 
that I have got out as many 
necessary things as will either 
supply my wants or enable me to 
supply myself, even as long as I 
live. 



Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony that there was 
scarce any condition in the world so miserable but there was some^ 
thing negative, or something positive, to be thankful for in it : and let 
this stand as a direction, from the experience of the most miseral)le 
of all conditions in this world : that we may always find in it some- 
thing to comfort ourselves from, and to set. in the description of 
gooa and evil, on the credit side of the account. 

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, and 
given over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship— I say, 
giving over Uiese things, I began to apply myself to arrange my way 
of living, and to make thmgs as easy to me as I could. 

I have alreadv described my habitation, which was a tent under 
the side of a rook, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables ; 
but I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up 
agauist it of turfs, about two feet thick on the outside : and after 
some time (I think it was a year and a half) I raised rafters from ii, 
leaning to the reck, and thatched or covered it with b( ughs of trees, 
and such things as I could get, to keep out tl^e rain ; which I found 
at some times of the year very violent. 

I have already observed ^QW I l^rought all my goq^f into this pale, 



i 



48 ROBIKSON CRUSOE. 

and into the care which I had made behind me. But I must observe, 
too, that at first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they 
lay in no order, so they took up all my place ; I had no room to turn 
myself : so I set myself to enlarge my cave, and worked farther into^ 
tlie earth ; for it was a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the 
labor I bestowed on it : and so when I found I was pretty safe as to 
beasts of prey, I worked sideways, to the right hand into the rock ; 
/and then turning to the right ^ain, worked quite out, and made me 
a door tp come out on the outsiae of my pale or fortification. 

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it was a back way to 
my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to store my goods. 

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things 
as, I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a table ; for with- 
out these I was not able to enjoy the few comforts 1 had in the 
world ; I could not write, or eat, or do several things with so much 
pleasure, without a table ; so I Went to work. And here I must 
needs observe, that as reason is the substance and origin of the math-^ 
ematics, so by stating and squaring everything by reason, and by 
making the most rational judgment of things, every man may be^ in 
time, m&ster of every mechanic art. I Iwwi never handled a tool in 
my life ; and yet, in time, by labor, application, and contrivance, I 
found, at last, that I wanted nothing but I could have made it, 
especially if I had had tools. However, 1 made abundance of 
ihmgs, even without tools ; and some with no more tools than an 
adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made that way before, 
and that with infinite labor. For example, if I wanted a board, I 
had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an edge before 
me, and hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I had brought it 
to be thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is 
true, by this method I could make but one board out of a whole 
tree ; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I 
had for the prodigious deal of time and labor which it took me up to 
make a plank or board ; but my time or labor was little worth, and 
so it was as well employed onp way as another. 

However, I made me a ta: h and a chair, as I obsenred above^ in 
the first place ; and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I 
brought on my raft from the ship. But when I had wrought 
out some boards as above, I made large shelves, of the breadth of a 
foot and a half, one over another, all along one side of my cave; to 
lay all my tools, nails, and iron-work on ; and, in a word, to sepa* 
rate everything at large into their places, that I might come easily at 
them. 1 knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guna 
and all things that would hang up : so that had my cave been to be 
seen, it looked like a general magazine of all necessary things ; and I 
had everything so ready at my hand that it was a great pleasure to 
me to see all my goods in such order, and especially to find my 
stock of all necessaries so great.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 49 

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of every day's em- 
ployment ; for, indeed, at first, I was in too much Imrry, and not 
only hurry as to labor, but in too much discomposure of mind ; and 
qxy journal would have been full of many dull things : for example, 
I must have said thus : ** Sept. 80<^. — A.fter 1 had got to shore, and 
had escaped drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my de- 
liverance, having first vomited, with the great quantity of salt water 
which had got into my stomach, and recovering myself a little, I ran 
about the shore wringing my hands and beating my head and face ; 
exclaiming at my misery, and crying out, * I was undone, undone ! ' 
till, tired and faint, I was forced to lie down on the ground to re- 
pose ; but durst not sleep, for fear of being devoured. '.' 

Some days after this, and after I had l)een on board the ship, and 
got all that I could out of her, yet I could not forbear getting up to 
the top of a little mountain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of sceinir 
a ship ; then fancy, at a vast distance, I spied a sail, please myself 
with the hopes of it, and then after looking steadily, till I was al- 
most blind, lose it quite, and sit down and weep like a child, and thus 
increase ray misery by my folly. 

But having gotten over these things in some measure, and 
having settled my household stuff and habitation, made me a 
table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I began 
to keep my journal ; of which I shall here give you the copy (thouffh 
in it will be told all these particulars over again) as long as it lasted ; 
for having no more ink, I was forced to leave it off. 

THE JOUKNAL. 

September 30, 1659. — I, poor, miserable Robinson Crusoe, being 
i^iipwrecked, during a dreadful storm in the offing, came on shore on 
this dismal, unfortunate island, which I called " The Island of De^ 
spair ;'* all the rest of the ship's company being drowned, and myself 
almost dead. 

All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal cir- 
cumstances I was brought to ; viz., 1 had neither food, house, 
clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to ; and, in despair of any relief, 
saw nothing but death before me : either that I should be devoured 
by wild bec»ts, murdered bv savages, or starved to death for want of 
food. At the approach of night I sfept in a tree, for fear of wild 
creatures ; but slept soundly, though it rained all night. 

October 1. — In the morning I saw,* to my great surprise, the ship 
had floated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again much ^ 
nearer the island ; which as it was some comfort, on one hand, for 
seeing her sit upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if the wind 
abated, I might get on board, and get some food and necessaries out 
of her for my relief ; so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at 
the loss of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all staid on 



50 EOBINSOiJ' CRUSOE. 

board, might have saved the ship, or, at least, that they would not 
have been all drowned, as ihey were ; and that, had the men been 
saved, we might perhaps have built us a boat out of the ruins of the 
ship, to have carried us to some other part of the world. I spent 
great part of this day in perplexing myself on these things ; but, at 
tength, seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the sand as near as I 
could, and then swam on boai'd. This day also it continued raining, 
though with no wind at all. 

From the 1st of October to the 24th. — All these days entirely spent 
in many several voyages, to get all I could out of the ship, which I 
brought on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much rain also, 
in the. days, though vJiih some intervals of fair weather ; but it 
seems this was the rainy season. 

Oct. 20. — I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon it ; 
but being in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I recov- 
ered many of them when the tide was out. 

Oct. 25.— It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wind ; 
during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little 
harder than before, and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of 
her, and that only at low water. I spent this day in covering and 
securing the goods which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil 
them. 

Oct. 26. — I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out a 
place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself from 
any attack in the night, either from wild beasts or men. Toward 
night I fixed upon a proper place, under a rock, and marked out a 
semicircle for my encampment ; which I resolved to strengthen with 
a work, wall, or fortification, made of double piles, lined within with 
cables and without with turf. 

From the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard in carrying all my 
goods to my new habitation, though some part of the time it rained 
exceedingly hard. 

The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island with my gun, 
to see for some ftiod and discover the country ; when I killed a 
she-goat, and her kid followed me home, which I afterward killed 
also because it would not feed. 

November 1. — I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there for the 
first night ; making it as large as I could, with stakes driven in to 
swing my hammock upon. 

Nov, 2. — I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of tim- 
ber which made my rafts, and with them formed a fence round me, 
a little within the place I had marked out for my fortification. 

Nov. 3. —I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like ducks, 
which were very good food. In the afternoon went to woik to 
make me a table. 

Nov. 4. — This morning I began to order my times of work, of go- 
ing out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversioii ; viz.* 



f 



_■&_■ 



JROIUNSON CRUSOE. 51 

every momiDg I walked out with my ciin for two or three houis, if 
it did not rain ; then employed my sell lo work till about eleven 
o'clijck ; then ate what I had to live on ; and from twelve till two I 
lay down to sleep, the weather being excessively hot ; and then, in the 
evening, to work again. The working part c f this day and of the 
next was wholly employed in making my cable, for I was yet but a 
very sorry workman, though time and necessity made me a complete 
natural mechanic soon afler, as 1 believe they would do any one else. 

Nov. 5. — This day, went abroad with my gun and my dog, and 
killed a wild cat ; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for noth- 
ing ; every creature that I killed I took off the skins and preserved 
them. Cuming back by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of sea- 
fowls, which I did not understand ; but was surprised, and almost 
frightened, with two or three seals, which, while I was gazing at, not 
well knowing what they were, got into the sea, and escaped me for 
that time. 

Nov. 6. — After my morning walk, I went to work with my table 
again, and finished it, though not to my Uking ; nor was it long be- 
fore I learned to mend it. 

Nov. 7. — Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, 
9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday), I took 
wholly up to make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a 
tolerable shape, but never to please me ; and even in the making I 
pulled it in pieces several times. 

Note. — ^1 soon neglected my keeping Sundays ; for, omitting my 
mark for them on my post, I forgot which was which. 

Nov, 13. — This day it rained, which refreshed me exceedingly and 
cooled the earth ; but it was accompanied with ter4^ible thunder and 
lightning, which frighted me dreadfully, for fear of my powder. As 
soon as it was over, I resolved to separate my stock of powder into 
as many little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger. 

Nov. 14, 15, 16. — These three days I spent in making little square 
chests, or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two pounds at 
most, of powder ; and so putting the powder in, I stowed it in places 
as secure and remote from one another as possible. On one of these 
three days I killed a large bird that was good to eat, but I knew nut 
what to call it. 

Nov. 17. — This day I began to dig behind my tent into the rock, 
to make room for my further conveniency. 

Note. — Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work : viz. , a 
pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket ; so I desisted from 
my work, and began to consider how to supply that want, and make 
me some tools. As for the pickaxe, I made use of the iron crows, 
which were proper enough, though heavy ; but the next thing was a 
i^vel or spade ; this was so absolutely necessary that, indeed, I 
cofild do nothing effectually without it ; but what kind of one to 
OMikA I knew not. 



jfe 



52 llOUIXSOX CRUSOE. 

Nov, 18. — The next day, in searcbin^ the woods, I found a tree of 
that wood, or like it, which, in the Brazils, they call the iron-tree, 
for its exceeding hardness ; of this, with greai labor, and almost 
spoiling my axe, 1 cut a piece, and brouglit it home, too, with diffl- 
culty enough, for it was exceeding heavy. The excessive hardness 
3f the wood, and my having no other way, made mo a long .while 
upon this machine, for I worked it effectually by little and little into 
the form of a shovel or spade ; the handle exactly shaped iike ours 
m England, only that the broad part, having no iron shod upon it at 
bottom, it would not last me so long ; however, it served well 
enough for the uses which I had occasion to put it to ; but never 
was a shovel, I believe, made after that fashion, or 8D long in 
making. 

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheelbarrow. A 
basket I could not make by any means, having no such things as 
twigs that would bend to make wicker-ware — at least, none yet 
found out ; and as to a wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all but 
the wheel ; but that I had no notion of ; neither did I know how 
to go about it ; besides, I had no possible way to make the iron gud- 
geons for the spindle or axis of the wheel* to run in ; so I gave it 
over, and so, for carrying away the earth which I dug out of the 
cave, I made me a thing like a hod, which thfe laborers carry mortar 
in when they serve the bricklfiuyers. This was not so difficult to me 
as the making the shovel ; and yet this and the shovel, and the at- 
tempt which 1 made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took tne up no 
less than four days— I mean always excepting my morning walk 
with my gun, which 1 sekiom failed, and very seldom failed also 
bringing home something fit to eat. 

Nov, 23. — My other work having now stood still, because of my 
making these tools, when they were finished I went on, and working 
every day, as raj; strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days 
entirely in widening ana deepening my cave, that it might hold my 
goods commodiously. 

Note. — During all this time, I worked to make this room, or cave, 
spacious eiMHigfa to accommodate me as a warehouse, or magazine, a 
kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for my lodging, I kept to 
the tent ; except that sometimes, in the wet season of the year, it 
rained so hard that I could not keep myself dry, which caused me 
afterward to cover all my place within my pale with long poles, in 
the form of rafters, leaning against the rock, and load them with 
flags and large leaves of trees, like a thatch. 

December 10. — I began now to think my cave or vault finished, 
when on a sudden Ht seems I hcui made it too large) a great quantity 
of earth fell down irom the top and one side ; so much that, in shdrt, 
it frighted me, and not without reason, too ; for if I had been under 
it, I had never wanted a grave-digger. I had now a great deal of 
work to do over again, for I had the loose earth to carry out ; and/ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 53 

'Which was of more importance, I liad the ceiling to prop up, so that 
I might be sure no more would come down. 

Dec, 11. — This day I went to work with it accordingly, and got 
two shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two pieces of 
boards across over each post ; this I finished the next day ; and set- 
ting more posts up with boards in about a week more I had the roof 
secured ; and the posts, standing in rows, served me for partitions to 
part oft the house. 

Dec. 17. — From this day to the 20th I placed shelves, and knocked 
up nails on the posts, to hang everything up that could l)e hung up ; 
and now I began to be in some order within doors. 

Dec, 20. — Now I carried everything into the cave, and began to 
furnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards like a dresser, to 
order my victuals upon ; but boards began to be very scarce with 
me ; also 1 made me another table. 

Dec. 24. — Much rain all night and all day : no stirring out. 

Dec, 25.— Riun all day. 

Dec. 26. — No rain, and the earth much cooler than before, and 
plcasanter. 

Dec. 27.— Killed a young goat, and lamed another so that I caught 
K, and led it^home in a string ; when I had it at home, I bound and 
splintered up its leg, which was broke. 

N. B. — I took such care of it that it lived, and the leg grew well 
and as strong as ever ; bui by my nursing it so long it grew tame, 
and fe.d upon the little green at my door, and would not go away. 
This was the first tune Uiat I entertained a thought of t»'eeduig up 
some tame creatures, that I might have food when my powder and 
shot were all spent. 

Dec. 28, 29, 30, 31. — Great heats, and no breeze, so that there was 
no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food ; this time I spent 
in putting all my things in order within doors. 

Januai^l X. — Verjr hot still : but I went abroad early and late with 
my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This evening, going 
farther into the valleys which lay toward the centre of the island, I 
found there were plenty of ^oats, though exceedingly shy and hard 
to come at ; however, I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog 
to hunt them down. 

Jan, 2. — Accordingly, the next day I went out witJi my dog, and 
set him upon the goats ; but I was mistaken, for they all faced about 
upon the dog, and he knew his danger too well, for he would not 
come near them. 

Jan, 3. — I began my fence or wall : which, being still jealous of 
my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and 
strong. 

N. B.— This wall bein^ described before, I purposely omit what 
was said in the journal ; it is sufficient to observe that 1 was no less 
time thjui from the 3d of January to the 14Ui of April working, fin- 



48 ROBIKSON CRUSOE. 

and into the care which I had made behind me. But I must observe, 
too, that at first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they 
lay in no order, so they took up all my place ; I had no room to turn 
myself : so I set myself to enlarge my cave, and worked farther into'^ 
tlie earth ; for it was a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the 
labor I bestowed on it : and so when I found I was pretty safe as to 
beasts of prey, I worked sideways, to the right hand into the rock ; 
.'and then turning to the right again, worked quite out, and made me 
a door tp come out on the outside of my pale or fortification. 

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it was a back way to 
my lent and to ray storehouse, but gave me room to store my goods. 

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary thipgs 
as, I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a table ; for with- 
out these I was not able to enjoy the few comforts 1 had in the 
world ; I could not write, or eat, of do several things with so much 
pleasure, without a table : so I Went to work. And here I must 
needs observe, that as reason is the substance and origin of the math-^ 
ematics, so by stating and squaring everything by reason, and by 
making the most rational judgment of things, every man may be, in 
time, m&ster of every mechanic art. I had never handled a tool in 
my life ; and yet, in time, by labor, application, and contrivance, I 
found, at last, that I wanted nothing but I could have made it, 
especially if I had had tools. However, 1 made abundance of 
things, even without tools ; and some with no more tools than an 
adze and a hatchet^ which perhaps were never made that way before, 
and that with infinite labor. For example, if I wanted a board, I 
had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an edge before 
me, and hew it fist on either side with my axe, till I had brought it 
to be thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is 
true, by this method I could make but one board out of a whole 
tree ; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I 
had for the prodigious deal of time and labor which it took me up to 
make a plank or board ; but my time or labor was little worth, and 
so it was as well employed one way as another. 

However, I made me a ta: ii and a chair, as I observed above, in 
the first place ; and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I 
brought on my raft from the ship. But when I had wrought 
out some boards as above, I made large idielves, of the breadth of a 
foot and a half, one over another, all along one side of my cave, to 
lay all my tools, nails, and iron-work on ; and, in a word, to sepa- 
rate everything at large into their places, that I might come easily at 
them. 1 knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns 
and all things that would hang up : so that had my cave been to be 
seen, it looked like a general magazine of all necessary things ; and I 
had everything so ready at my hand that it was a great pleasure to 
me to see all my goods in such order, and especially to find my 
stock of all necessaries so great.

sprang up immediately ; whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else, 
at that time, it bad been burnt up and destroyed. 

I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their 
season, which was about the end of June ; and, laying up every 
corn, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping, in time, to have some 
quantity, sufficient to supply me with bread. But it was not till the 
fourth year that I could allow myself the least grain of this corn to 
eat, and even ihen but sparingly, as I shall say afterward, in its 
order ; for I lost all that I sowea the first season by not observing 
the proper time ; for I sowed it just before the dry season, so that it 
never came up at all, at least not as it would have done : of which in 
its place. 

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks 
of rice, which I preserved with the same care and for the same «se, 
or to the same purpose, to make me bread, or rather food ; for I 
found ways to cook it without baking, though I did that also after 
some time. 

But to return to my journal : 

I worked excessively hard these three or four months, to get my 
wall done ; and the 14th of April, I closed it up, contriving to go 
into it, not by a door, but over the wall by & ladder, that there might 
be no sign on the outside of my habitation. 

April 16u — I finished the ladder ; so I went up the ladder to the 
top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down in the inside : 
this was a complete inclosure to me ; for within I had lojm enough, 
and nothing could come at me from wiUiout, unless it could first 
mount my wall. 

The very next day after l^is wall was finished, I had almost had 
all my labor overthrown at once, and myself killed. The case was 
thus : As I was busy m the inside, behind my tent, just at the en- 
trance into my cave, 1 was terribly frighted with a most dreadful 
surprising thing indeed ; for, all on a sudden, I found the earth come 
crumbling down from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the 
hill over my head, and two of the posts 1 had set up in the cave 
cracked in a frightful manner. I was heartily scared ; but thought 
nothing of what was really the cause, only thinking that the top of 
my cave was fallen in, as some of it had done before ; and for fear I 
should be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not thinking 
myself safe there neither, I got over my wall for fear of the pieces 
of the hill, which I expected might roll down upon me. I had no 
sooner stepped down upoai the firm ground than I plainly saw it was 
a terrible earthquake ; for the ground I stood on shook three times 
at about eight minutes' distance, with three such shocks as would 
have overturned the strongest building that could be supposed to 
have stood on the earth, and a great piece of the top of a rock, which' 
stood about half a mile from m&, next the sea, fell down, with such 
a terrible noise as I never heard' in all my life. I perceived also the 



B0B1N80N CRUSOE. 57 

Tery sea was put into violent motion by it ; and I believe ttie shocks 
were stronger under the water than on the island. 

I was so much amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the 
like, nor discoursed with any one that had, that I Vas like one dead 
or stupefied ; and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, 
like one that was tossed at sea ; but the noise of the failinj? of the 
rock awaked me, as it were, and rousing me from the stupefied con. 
dition I was in, filled me with horror, aad I thought of nothing then 
but the hill falling upon my tent and all my household goods, and 
burying all at once ; and this sunk my very soul within me a second 
time. 

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I 
began to take coun^e ; and y^et I had not heart enough to go over 
my wall a^ain, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the 
ground greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowift^ what to do. 
All this while, I had not the least serious religious thought ; nothing 
but the common ** Lord, have mercy upon me I" and when it was 
over, that went away too. 

While I sat thus, I foundthe air overcast, and grow cloudy, as if 
it would rain ; soon after that, the wind arose by little and little, so 
that in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane : the 
sea was, all on a sudden, covered over with foam and froth ; the 
shore was covered with the breach of the water ; the trees were torn 
up by the roots ; and a terrible storm it was. This held about three 
hours, and then began to abate ; and in two hours more it was quite 
calm, and began to rain very hard. All this while I sat upon the 
ground, very much terrified and dejected ; when on a sudden it came 
into my thoughts that these winds and rain being the consequences 
of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, and I 
might venture into my cave again. With this thought, my spirits 
beffau to revive ; and the rain also helping to persuade me, I went in 
and sat down in my tent ; but the rain was so violent that my tent 
was ready to be beaten down with it ; and I was forced to go into 
my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall 
on my head. This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz., to 
cut a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to let the water 
go out, which would else have flooded my cave. After I had been in 
my cave for some time, and found still no more shocks of the earth- 
quake follow, I began to be more composed. And now to support 
my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little 
store, and took a small sup of rum ; which, however, I did then and 
always very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when that 
was gone. It continued raining all that night, and great part of the 
nu^ day, so that I could not stir abroad ; but my mind being more 
coB^^Kwed, I began to think of what I had best do ; concluding, that 
if tfee island was subject to these earthquakes, there would be no liv- 
big for me in a cave, but I must consider of building a little hut in

board, iilight have saved the ship, or, at least, that they would not 
have been all drowned, as ihey were ; and that, had the men been 
saved, we migjit perhaps have built us a boat out of the ruins of the 
ship, to have carried us to some other part of the world. I spent 
great part of this day in perplexing myself on these things ; but, at 
length, seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the sand as near as I 
could, and then swam on boaid. This day also it continued raining, 
though with no wind at all. 

From the 1st of October to the 34th. — All these days entirely spent 
in many several voyages, to get all I could out of the ship, which I 
brought on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much rain also, 
in the- days, though vfiih some intervals of fair weather ; but it 
seems this was the rainy season. 

Oct. 20. — I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon it ; 
but being in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I recov- 
ered many of ihem when the tide was out. 

Oct. 25.— It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wind ; 
during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little 
harder than before, and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of 
her, and that only at low water. I spent this day in covering and 
securing the goods which I had saved, that the rain mi^^ht not spoil 
them. 

Oct, 26. — I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out a 
place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself from 
any attack in the night, either from wild beasts or men. Toward 
night I fixed upon a proper place, under a rock, and marked out a 
semicircle for my encampment ; which I resolved to strengthen with 
a work, wall, or fortification, made of double piles, lined within with 
cables and without with turf. 

From the 26th to the 30tli I worked very hard in carrying all my 
goods to my new habitation, though some part of the time it rained 
exceedingly hard. 

The 3ist, in the morning, I went out into the island with my gun, 
to see for some fbod and discover the country ; when I killed a 
she-goat, and her kid followed me home, which I afterward killed 
also because it would not feed. 

November 1. — I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there for the 
first night ; making it as large as I could, with stakes driven in to 
swing my hammock upon. 

Nav. 2. — I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of tim- 
ber which made my rafts, and with them formed a fence round me, 
a little within the place I had marked out for my fortification. 

Nov. 8. —I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like ducks, 
•which were very good food. In the afternoon went to woik to 
make me a table. 

Nov. 4. — This morning I began to order my times of work, of go- 
ing out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion ; viz.. 



JROIUNSOK CRUSOE. 51 

every inomiDg I walked out with my ^un for two or three houi8, if 
it did not rain ; then employed my sell lo work till about eleven 
o'clock ; then ate whut I had to live on ; and from twelve till two I 
lay d(jwnto sleep, the weather being excessively hot ; and then, in the 
evening, to work again. The working part cf this day and of the 
next was wholly employed in making my cable, for I was yet but a 
very sorry workman, though time and necessity made me a complete 
natural mechanic soon afler, as 1 l)elieve they would do any one else. 

Hov. 5. — This day, went abroad with my gun and my dog, and 
killed a wild cat ; lier skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for noth- 
ing ; every creature that I killed I tf)ok off the skins and preserved 
them. Coining back by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of sea- 
fowls, which I did not understand ; but was surpiised, and almost 
frightened, with two or three seals, which, while 1 was gazing at, not 
well knowing what they were, got into the sea, and escaped me for 
that time. 

2^ov. 6. — After my morning walk, I went to work with my table 
again, and finished it, though not to my Uking ; nor was it long be- 
fore I learned to mend it. 

J^ov. 7. — Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, 
9th. 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday), I took 
wholly up to make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a 
tolerable shape, but never to please me ; and even in the making I 
pulled it in pieces several times. 

Note. — ^1 soon neglected my keeping Sundays ; for, omitting my 
mark for them on my post, I forgot which was which. 

Mfv. 13. — This day it rained, which refreshed me exceedingly and 
cooled the earth ; but it was accompanied with ter4^ible thunder and 
hghtniog, which frighted me dreadfully, for fear of my powder. As 
soon as it was over, I resolved to separate my stock of powder into 
as many little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger. 

I^ov. 14, 15, 16. — These three days I spent in making little square 
chests, or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two pounds at 
most, of powder ; and so putting the powder in, I stowed it in places 
as secure and remote from one another as possible. On one of these 
three days I killed a large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not 
what to call it. 

-Nov. 17. — This day I began to dig behind my tent into the rock, 
to mikke room for my further conveniency. 

Note. — Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work : viz., a 
pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket ; so I desisted from 
my work, and began to consider how to supply that want, and make 
me some tools. As for the pickaxe, I made use of the iron crows, 
which were proper enough, though heavy ; but the next thing was a 
M^ovel or simde ; this was so absolutely necessary that, indeed, I 
o<^d do nothing effectually without it ; but what kind of one to 
I3m» I knew not.

an open place, which 1 might surround with a wall, bjs I had done 
here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts or men ; for I 
conclmled if I staid where 1 was, I should certainly, one time or 
other, be buried alive. 

With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the place 
where it now stood, which was iust under the hanging precipice of 
the hill ; and which, if it should be shaken again, would certainly 
fall upon my tent ; and I spent the two next days, being the 19th 
and 30th of April, in contriving where and how to remove my habi- 
tation. The fear of being swallowed up alive made me that I never 
slept in quiet ; and yet the apprehension of lying abroad without any 
fence was almost equal to it ; but still, when I looked about, and 
saw how everything was put in order, how pleasantly concealed I 
was, and ho^j^safe from danger, it made me very loath to remove. 
In the mean time, it occurred to me that it would require a vast desd 
of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented to venture 
where 1 was till I had formed a camp for myself, and had secured it 
so as to remove to it. So with this resolution I composed myself for 
a time ; and resolved that I would go to work with ail speed to build 
me a wall with piles and cables, etc., in a circle, as before, and set 
my tent up in it, when it was finished ; but that I would venture to 
stay where I was till it was finished and fit to remove. This was 
the 21st. 

April 22. — ^The next morning I began to consider of means to put 
this resolve into execution ; but I was at a great loss about my tools. 
I had three large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the 
hal<;hets for tratfic with the Indians) ; but with much chopping and 
cutting knotty, hard wood, they were all full of notches, and dull ; 
and though Thad a grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools 
too. This cost me as much thought as a statesman would have be- 
stowed upon a grand point of politics, or a Judge upon the life and 
death of a man. Ai length I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn 
it with my foot, that I might have both my hands at liberty. 

Note. — I had never seen any such tbing in England, or at least not 
to take notice how it was done, though since I have observed it is 
very common there ; besides that, my grindstone was very large and 
heavy. This machine cost me a full week's work to bring it to per- 
fection. 

April 28, 29. — These two whole days I took up in grinding my 
tools, my machine for turning my grindstone performing very well. 

April 30. — Having perceived my bread had been low a great while, 
now I took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one biscuit-cake a 
day, which made my heart very heavy. 

May 1. — In the morning, looking toward the sea-side, the tide 
being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary, 
and it looked like a cask ; when I came to it, I found a small barrel, 
and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were driven 



EOBINSOK CRUSOE. 69 

on shore b^ the latfe hurricane ; and looking toward the wreck itself, 
I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the water than it used to 
do. I examined the barrel which was driven on shore, and soon 
found it was a barrel of gunpowder ; but it had taken water, and the 
powder was caked as hard as a stone : however, I rolled it farther 
on shore for the present, and went on upon the sands, as near a-s I 
could to the wreck of the ship, to look for more. 

When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely removed. 
The forecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at 
least six feet, and the stern, which was broke in pieces and paitcd 
from the rest by the force of the sea, soon after I had left rummag- 
ing lier, was tossed, as it were, up and cast on one aide ; and the sand 
was thrown so high on that side next her stern, that whereas there 
was a great place of water before, so that I could not come within a 
quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I could now walk 
quite up to her when the tide was out. I was surprised with this at 
first, but soon concluded it must ha done by the earthquake ; and as 
by this violence the ship was more broke open than formerly, so 
many things came daily on shore, which the sea had loosened, and 
which the winds and water rolled by degrees to the land. 

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my 
habitation, and I busied myself mightily, that day especially, in 
searching whether I could make any way mto the ship ; but I found 
nothing was to be expected of that kind, for all the inside of the ship 
was choked up with sand. However, as I had learned not to despair 
of anything, I resolved to pull everything to pieces that I could of 
the ship, concluding that everything I could get from her would be 
of some use or other to me. 

May 3. — I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam through, 
which I thought held some of the upper part or quarter-deck to- 
gether, and when I liad cut it through, I cleared away the sand as 
well as I could from the side which lay highest ; but the tide coming 
in, I was obliged to give over for that time. 

May 4. — I went a-lishing, but caught not one fish that I durst eat 
of, till 1 was weary of my sport ; when, just going to leave oil, 1 
caught a young dolphin. I had made me a long line of some rope- 
yarn, but 1 had no hooks ; yet I fiequently caught fish enough, as 
much as I cared to eat ; all which I dried in the sun, and ate them 
dry. 

May 5. — Worked on the wreck ; cut another beam asunder, and 
brought three great fir planks off from the decks, which I tied 
together and ma^e to float on shore when the tide of tlood came on. 

May 6. — Worked- on the wreck ; got several iron bolts out of her, 
and other pieces of iron- work ; worked veiy hard, and came home 
▼erv much tire«l, and had thoughts of giving it over. 

May 7. — Went to the wreck again, not with an intent to work, but 
found the weight of the wreck had broke itself down, the beams 



60 BOBINSON CRUSOE. 

being cut ; that several pieces of the ship seemed ta lie loose, and the 
inside of the hold lay so open that I could see into it ; but it was 
almost full of water and sand. 

May 8. — Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to wrench 
up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water or sand. I 
wrenched open two planks, and brought them on shore .also with the 
tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck for next day. 

May 9. — Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way into the 
body of the wi-eck, and felt several casks, and loosened tliem with 
the crow, but could not break them up. I feit also a roll of English 
lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy to remove. 

May 10-14. — Went every day to the wreck ; and got a ereat many 
pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and two or three hundred 
weight of iron. 

May 15. — I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a piece 
off the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet, and driving it 
with the other ; but as it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I 
could not make any blow to drive the hatchet. 

May 16. — It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck appeared 
more broken by the force of the water ; but I staid so long in the 
woods, to get pigeons for food, that the tide prevented my going to 
the wreck that day. 

May 17.— I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, >it a 
great distance, near two miles off me, but resolved to see wliat they 
were, and found it was a piece of the head, but too heavry |or me u> 
bring away. 

May 24. — Every day, to this day, I worked on the wreck ; and with 
hard labor I loosened some things so much witli the crow that the firbt 
blowing tide several casks floated out, and two of the seamen's chests ; 
but the wind blowing from the shore, nothing came to land that day 
but pieces of timber, and ^ hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in 
it ; but the salt water and the sand had spoiled it. I continued this 
work every day to the 15th of June, except the time necessary to get 
food, whicli I always appointed, during this part of my employment, 
.to be when the tide was up, that I might be ready when it war ebbed 
but ; and by this time I had got timber, and plank, and iron-work, 
enough to have built a good boat, if I had known how ; 2ind also I 
got, at several times, and in several pieces, near one hundred weight 
of the sheet-lead. 

JuTht 16. — Going down to the sea-side, I found a large tortoise, or 
turtle. This was the first I had seen, which, it seems, was only my 
misfortune, not any defect of the place, or scarcity ; for had I hap- 
pened to be on the other side of the island, I might have had hun- 
dreds of them every day, as I found afterward ; but perhaps had paid 
dear enough for them. 

June 17. — I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her threescore 
eggs ; and her nesh was to me, at that time, the most savory and

63 



pleasant that ever I taBted in my life, having had no flf«h, but ot 
goats and fowls, since 1 landed in this horrid place. 

June 18. — Rained all day, and I staid within. I thought, at this 
time, the rain felt cold, and I was something chilly ; which I knew 
was not usual in that latitude. 

June 19. — Very ill, an<l shivering, as if the weather had been cold. 

June 20. — No rest all night ; violent pains in my head, and feverish. 

/ttw«21.--yery ill ; frighted almost to death with the apprehen- 
sions of my sad condilion— to be sick, and no help : prayed to (xoii, 
for the ftrst lime since the storm off Hull, but scarce knew what I 
said, or why ; my thoughts being all confused. 

June 23. — A little better ; but under dreadful apprehensions of 
sickness. 

June 23. — Very bad again ; cold and shivering, and then a violent 
headache. 

June 24. — ^Much better. 

June 25. — An ague very violent ; the fit held me seven hours ; cold 
fit, and hot, with faint sweats after it. 

June 26. — Better ; and having no victuals to eat, took my gun, but 
found myself very weak ; however, I killed a she-goat, and with 
much difficulty got it home, and broiled some of it, and ate. I would 
fain have stewed it, and made some broth, but had no pot. 

June 27.^— The ague again so violent that I lay abed all day, and 
neither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for thirst ; but so 
weak, I had not strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to 
drink. Prayed to God again, but was light-headed ; and when I 
was not, I was so ignorant that I knew not what to say ; only 1 lay 
and cried, ** Lord, look upon me I Lord, pity me ! Lortl, have mercy 
upon me ! I suppose I did nothing else for two or three hours ; till 
the fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the 
night. When I awoke, I found myself much refreshed, but weak, 
and exceeding thirsty ; however, as I had no water in my habitation, I 
was forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep again. In this second 
sleep, I had this terrible dream : 1 thought that I was sitting on the 
ground, on the outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew 
after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend from a great 
black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and light upon the ground : he 
was all over as bright as a flame, so that I could but just bear to look 
toward him : his countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, im- 
possible for words to describe ; when ho stepped upon the ground 
with his feet, I thought the earth trembled, just as ]t had done be- 
fore in the earthquake, and all the air looked, to my apprehension, 
as if it had been filled with flashes of fire. He was no sooner landed 
upon the earth, but he moved forward toward me, with a long spear 
or weapon in his hand, to kill me ; and when he came to a rising 
ground, at some distance, he spoke to me — or I heard a voice so 
terrible that it is impossible to express the terror of it. All that I can 



— , 




60/ EOBINSON CRUSOE. 

ay I understood was this : ** Seeing all these things have not 
brought thee to repentance, now thou slialt die ;'* at which words, 
I thought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand to kill me. 

No one that shall ever read this account will expect that I should 
be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this ten'ible vision. I 
mean, that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those 
horrors. Nor is it any more possible to describe the impression that 
remained upon my mind when I awaked, and found it was but a 
dream. 

I had, alas ! no divine knowledge. What I had received by the 
good instruction of my father was then worn out by an unlnterrupt* 
ed series, for eight years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant 
conversation with none but such as \sere, like myself, wicked and 
profane to the last degree. I do not remember that I had, in all that 
time, one thought that so much as tended either to looking upward 
toward God, or inward toward a reflection upon my own ways ; but 
a certain stupidity of soul, without desire of good, or conscience of 
evil, had entirely overwhelmed me ; and I was all that the most 
hardened, unthinking, wicked creature among oiir common sailors 
can be supposed to be : not having the least sense, either of the fear 
of God, in danger, or of thankfulness to God, in deliverance. 

In the relating what is already past of my story, this will be the 
more easily believed when I shall add, that tlirough all the variety 
of miseries that had to this day befallen me, I never had so much as 
one thought of it being the hand of God, or that it was a just punish- 
ment for my sin — my relxjllious behavior against my father— or ray 
present sins, which were great — or so much as a punishment for the 
general course of my wicked life. "When I was on the desperate ex- 
pedition on the desert shores of Africa, I never had so much as one 
thought of what would become of me, or one wish to God to direct me 
whitiicT I should go, or to keep me from the danger which apparently 
surrounded me, as well from voracious creatures as cruel savages. 
But I was merely thoughtless of a God or a Providen(;e, acted like a 
mere brute, from the principles of nature, and by the dictates of 
common-sense only, and, indeed, hardly that. When I was deliv- 
ered and taken up at sea by the Portuguese captain, well used, and 
dealt justly and honorably with, as well as charitably, I had not the 
least thankfulness in my thoughts. When, again, I was ship- 
wrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning, on this island, I was 
as far from remorse, or looking on it as a judgment. I only said to 
myself often, that 1 was an unfortunate dog, and born to be always 
miserable. 

It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my ship's 
cmw drowned, and myself spared, 1 was surprised with a kind of 
ecstasy, and some transports of soul, which, had the grace of God 
assisted, might have come up to true thankfulness ; but it ended 
where it began, in a mere common flight of joy, or, as I may say, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 63 



being glad I was alive, without tlie least reflection upon the distin- 
guished <i:oodness of the hand which had preservAdrEne, and had 
singled me out to be preserv^^^vhfi|rc^tgp ^OwSMestioyed, or 
an inquiry ]j||i|JYtt1jf[(j7)r ^&^y€^n4nusii\eucif h1 unto me. Even 
just the aam^mMmfcm^slMy pibi(^lj^aDfin«gmrHlly have, after 
they are got safe gpQ^jSiwWw ahshVwreck, which they drown all in 
the next bowl of ^unch, and forget almost as soon as it is over ; and 
all the rest of my life was like it. Even when I was, afterward, on 
due consideration, made sensible of my condition, how I was cast on 
this dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind, out of all hope 
of relief or prospect of redemption, as soon as I saw but a pra«ptfct 
of living, and that I should not starve and perish for hunger, all the 
sense of my affliction wore oflf ; and I began to be very easy, applied 
myself to the works proper for my preservation and supply, and was 
far enough from behig atllicted at my condition, as a judgment from 
heaven, or as the hand of God against me : these were thoughts 
which very seldom entered my head. 

The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my journal, bad, at 
first, some little influence upon me, and began to affect me with seri- 
ousness, as long as I thought it haa something miraculous in it ; 
but as soon as ever that part of the thought was removed, all the im- 
pression that was raised from it wore off also, as I have noted 
already. Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more terri- 
ble in its nature, or more immediately directing to the invisible 
power which alone directs such things, yet no sooner was the first 
fright over, but the impression it had made went off also. I had no 
more sense of God or his judgments— much less of the present afflic- 
tion of my circumstances being from his hand — than if 1 had been in 
the most prosperous condition of life. But now, when I began to 
be sick, and a leisurely view of the miseries of death came to place 
Itself Ixffore me ; when my spirits began to sink under the burden of 
a strong distemper, and nature was exhausted with the violence of 
the fever ; conscience, that had slept so long, began to awake, and I 
began to reproach myself with my past life, in which I had so evi- 
dently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the justice of God to 
lay me under uncommon strokes, and to deal with me in so vindic- 
tive a manner. These reflections oppressed me for the second or 
third day of my distemper, and in the violence, as well of the fever 
as of the dreadful reproaches of my conscience, extorted some words 
from me like praying to God, though I cannot say they were either a 
prayer attended with desires or with hopes : it was rather the voice 
of mere fright and distress My thoughts were confused, the con- 
victions great upon my mind, and the horror of dying in such a mis- 
erable condition raised vapors into my head with the mere apprehen- 
sion ; and in these hurries of my soul, I knew not what mjr tongue 
might express. But it was rather exclamation, such as, ** Lord, 
wlmt a miserable creature am I ! If I should be sick, I shall certain- 



04 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

ly die for want of help ; and what will become of me ?** Then Ihe 
tears burst out of my eyes, and 1 could say no more for a good while. 
Ill this interval, the good advice of my father came to my mind, and 
"presently his prediction, which I mentioned at the beginning of tliis 
story, viz., that if I did take tliis foolish fitep God vv^ould not bless 
me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglect- 
ed liis counsel, when there might be none to assist in my recovery. 
*' Now," said I, aloud, '* my dear father's words are eomq to pass ; 
God's justice has overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me. 
I rejected the voice of Providence, which had mercifully put me in a 
posture or fetation of life wherein 1 might have been happy and easy ; 
but t would neither see it myself nor learn to know the blessing of 
it from my parents. I left them to mourn over my folly, and now I 
am left to mourn under the consequences of it. X refused their help 
and assistance, who would have lifted me in the world, and would 
have made everything easy to me. And now I have difllculties to strug- 
gle with, too great for even nature itself to support, and no assist- 
ance, no help, no comfort, no advice." Then I cried out, ** Lord, be 
my help, for I am in great distress." This was the first prayer, if I 
may call it so, that I had made for many years. 

I5ut to return to my journal : 

June 38. — Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I had 
had, and the fit l>eing entirely off, I got up ; and though the fright 
and terror of my dream were very great, yet I considered that the fit 
of the ague would return again the next da3% and now was my time 
to get some-thing to refresh and support myself when I should be 
ill ; and the first thing I did I filled a large square case-bottle 
with water, and set it upon my (able, in reach of my bed ; and to 
take off the chill or aguish disposition of the water, I put about a 
quarter of a pint of rum into it. and mixed them together. Then I 
got me a piece of the goat's flesh and broiled it on the coals, but could 
eat very little. I walked about, but was very weak, and withal very 
sad and heavy-hearted under a sense of my miserable condition, 
dreading the return of my distemper the next day. At night I made 
my supper of three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, 
and ate, as we call it, in the shelU and this was the first bit of meat I 
had ever asked God's blessing to, that I could remember, in my 
whole life. After I had eaten, I tried to walk, but found myself so 
weak that I could hardly carry a gun, for I never went out without 
that ; so I went but a Htlle way, and sat down upon the ground, 
looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and very calm 
and smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as these occurred to 
me: What is this earth and sea of which I have seen so much? 
Whence is it produced ? And what am I, and all the other creatures, 
wild and tame, human and brutal ? Whence are we ? Sure we are 
all made by some secret power, who formed the earth and sea, the 
air and sky. And who is that ? Then it followed most naturally. It

KOBINSON CKUSOB. G5 

is God that lias made all. Well, but then, it comes on strangely, if 
Qod has miide all these things, Jie guides and governs them all,'au«l 
all things that concern therii ; for the power that could make all 
things must certainly have power to guide aid direct them. If 
so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his works, either with< 
out his knowledge or appointment. 

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he knows that I 
am here, and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens 
without his appointment, he has appointed all this to befall me. 
Nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclu- 
sions, and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force, that it 
must needs be that God had appointed all this to befall me ; that I 
was brought into this miserable circumstance by his direction, he 
having the sole power, not of me only, but of everything that hap- 
pened in the world. Immediately it followed. Why has God done 
this to me ? What have I done to be thus used ? My conscience 
presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had blasphemed, and 
methought it spoke to me like a voice, " Wretch ! dost thou ask 
what thou hast done ? Look back upon a dreadful misspent life, 
and ask thyself, what thou hast not done ? Ask, why is it that thou 
wert not long a^o destroyed ? Why wert thou not drowned In Yar- 
mouth Koads ; Killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the 
Bailee man-of-war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of 
Africa ; or drowned here, when all the crew perished but thyself ? 
Dost thou ask, What have I done ?" I was struck dumb with these 
reflections, as one astonished, and had not a word to say — no, not to 
answer to A^^self , but rose up pensive and sad, walked back to my 
retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I liad been going to bed ; 
but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to 
sleep ; so I sat down in my chair and lighted my lamp, for it bagan 
to be dark. Now, as the apprehension of the return of my dis- 
temper terrified me very much, it occurred to my thought that the 
Brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distem- 
pers, and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which 
was quite cured, and some also that was green, and not quite cured. 

I went, directed by Heaven no doubt ; for in this chest I found a 
cure both for soul and body. I opened the chest, and found what I 
looked for, the tobacco ; and as the few books I had saved lay there 
too, I took out one of the Bibles which 1 mentioned before, and 
which to this time I had not found leisure, or inclination, to look 
into. I say, I took it out, and brought both that and the tobacco 
with me to the table. What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, 
in my distemper, or whether it was good for it or no ; but I tried 
several experiments with it, as if I was resolved it should hit one way 
or other. I first took a piece of leaf and chewed it in my mouth, 
which, indeed, at first, almost stupefied my brain, the tobacco being 
green and strong, and that I had not been much used to. Then X

took some and steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and resolred 
to take a dose of it when I lay down ; and, lastly, I burnt some 
upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of it as 
long as I could beaj it, as well for the heat as almost for suffoca- 
tion. In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible and be- 
gan to read ; but my head was too much disturbed with the tobacco 
to bear reading, at least at that time ; only having opened the book 
casually, the first words that occurred to me were these : ** Call on 
me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver .thee, and thou shalt 
glorif^r me.''^ These words were very apt to my ease, and made 
some impression upon my thoughts at the time of reading them, 
though not so much as they did afterward ; for, as for being deUv^ 
ered, the word had no sound, as I may say, to roe ; the thing was so 
remote, so impossible in my apprehension of things, that 1 becran^to 
say, as the children of Israel did when they were promised flesh to 
eat, *' Can God spread a table in the wilderness ?" so I began to say, 
** Can God himself deliver me from this place ?" And as it was not 
for many years that any hopes appeared, this prevailed very often 
upon my thoughts ; but, however, the words made a grej^^t impres- 
sion upon me, and I mused upon them very often. It grew now late, 
and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head so much that I 
inclined to sleep ; so I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should 
want anything in the night, and went to bed. But before I lay 
down, I did what I never had done in all my life ; I kneeled down, 
and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me, that if I called upon 
him in the day of trouble he would deliver me. After my broken 
and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had 
steeped the tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco 
that I could scarcely get it down ; immediately upon this I went to 
bed. I found presently it flew up into my heaa violently ; but I fell 
into a sonnd sleep, and waked no more till by the sun it must neces- 
sarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon the next day ; nay, to 
this hour I am partly of opinion that I slept all the next day and 
night, and till almost three the day after ; for otherwise I know not 
how I should lose a day out of my reckoning in the days of the 
week, as it appeared some years after I had done ; for if I had lost 
it by crossing and recrossing the line, I should have lost more than one 
day ; but certainly I lost a day in my account, and never knew 
which way. Be that, however, one way or the other, when I awaked 
I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and 
cheerful ; when 1 got up I was stronger than I was the day before, 
and my stomach better, for I was hungry ; and, in short, I had no 
fit the next day, but continued much altered for the better. This 
was the 29th. 

The fSOth was my well day, of course, and I went abroad with my 
gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a sea-fowl or two, 
something like a brand goose, and brought them home ; but was not 



KOBIKSOK CRUSOE. 67 

very forward to eat them ; so I ate some more of the turtle's eggs, 
which were very good. This evening I renewed the medicine, which 
I had supposed did me good the day before — the tobacco steeped in 
rum ; only I did not take so much as before, nor did I chew any of 
the leaf or hold my head over the smoke ; however, I was not so 
well the next day, which was the 1st of July, as I hoped I should 
have been ; for I had a little spice of the cold fit, but it was not 
much. 

July 2. — I renewed the medicine all the three ways ; and dosed 
myself with iras at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank. 

July 3. — I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not recover 
my full strength for some weeks after. While I was thus gathering 
strength my thoughts ran exceedingly upon this Scripture, ** I will 
deliver thee;" and the impossibility of my deliverance lay much 
upon my mind,, in bar of my ever expecting it ; but as I was discour- 
aging myself with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind that I 
pored so much upon my deliverance from the main affliction that I 
disregarded the deliverance I had received, and I was, as it were, 
made to ask myself such questions as these, viz. : Have I not been 
delivered, and wonderfully too, from sickness ? from the most dis- 
tressed condition that could be, and that was so fria;htful to me ? and 
what notice had I taken of it ? Had I done my part ? God had de- 
livered me, but I had not glorified him ; that is to say, I had not 
owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance : and how could I 
expect greater deliverance ? This touched my heart very much ; and 
immediately I knelt down and gave God thanks aloud for my recov- 
ery f n)m my sickness. 

«7wZy 4.— In the morning I took the Bible ; and beginning at the 
New Testament I began seriously to read it, and imposed upon my- 
self to read awhile every morning and every night ; not tyin^ myself 
to the number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts should engage 
me. It was not long after I set seriously to this work, till I found 
my heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the wickedness of 
my past life. The impression of my dream revived ; and the words," 
** All these things have not brought thee to repentance," ran serious- 
ly in my thoughts. I was earnestly begging of God to give me re- 
pentance, when it happened providentially, the very day, that, read- 
ing the Scripture, I came to these words : " He is exalted a Prince 
and a Saviour, to give repentance and to give remission." I threw 
down the book ; and with my heart as well as my Ijands lifted up to 
heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of joy, I cried out aloud, *' Jesus, thou 
Sf>n of David ! Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour ! give me re- 
pentance !" This was the first time I could say, iu the true sense of 
the words, that I prayed in all my life ; for now I prayed with a 
sense of my condition, and with a true Scripture view of hope, 
founded on the encouragement of the Word of God ; and from this 
time, I may say, I began to have hope that God would hear me. 



68 ROBINSON" CRUSOE. 

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, *' Call on 
me, and I will deliver thee," in a different sense from what I had 
ever done before; for then I had no notion of anything being called 
deliverance, but my being delivered from the captivity I was in ; for 
though I was indeed at large in the place, yet tlie island was certain- 
ly a prison to me, and that in the worse sense in Ihe Avorld. But 
uow I learned to take it in another sense ; now I looked back upon 
my past life with such lioVror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that 
my soul sought nothing of God but deliverance from llie load of guilt 
that bore down all my comfort. As for my sol itasy' life, it was 
nothing ; I did not so much as pray to be deliveied from it, or think 
of it ; it was all of no consideration, in comparison to this. And I 
add this part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever 
they come to a true sense of things they will find deliverance from sin 
a much greater blessing than deliverance from affliction. 

But leaving this part, I return to my journal : 

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my 
way of living, yet much easier to my mind : and my thoughts being 
directed, by a constant read'ng the Scripture and praying to God, to 
things of a higher nature, I had a great deal oi comfort within, 
which, till now, I knew nothing of ; also my health and strength re- 
turned, I bestirred myself to furnish myself with everything that I 
wanted, and make my way of living as regular as 1 could. 

From the 4th of July to the 14th I was chiefly employed in walk- 
ing about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a time, as 
a man that was gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness : for 
it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, and to what weakness I 
was reduced. The application which I made use of was perfectly 
new, and perhaps which had never cured an ague before ; neither can 
I recommend it to any to practise, by this experiment : and though 
it did carry off the fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening mc ; for 
I had frequent convulsions in m^ nerves and limbs for some time ; I 
learned from it also this, in particular, that being abroad in the rainy 
season was the most pernicious thmg to my health that could be, 
especially fn those rains which came attended with storms and hurri- 
canes of wind : for as the rain which came in the dry season was 
almost always accompanied with such storms, so I found that rain 
was much more dangerous than the rain which fell in September and 
October. 

I had now been in this unhappy island above ten months ; all pos^ 
sibiiity of deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely 
taken from me ; and I firmly believe that no human shape had ever 
set foot upon that place. Having now secured my habitation, as I 
thought, fully to my mind, I had a great desire to make a more per- 
fect discovery of the island, and to see what other productions I 
might find, which I yet knew nothing of. 

it was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular 



ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 69 

survey of the island itself. I went up the creek first, where, as I 
hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found, after I came about 
two miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher ; and that it was 
no more than a little brook of running wat«r, very fresh and good : 
but this being the dry season, tliere was hardly any water in some 
parts of it ; at least, not enough to run in any stream, so as it could 
be perceived. On the banks of this brook I found many pleasant 
savannas or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with arass ; and on 
the rising pails of them, next to the higher grounds, where the 
water, as might be supposed, never overflow^, 1 foimd a great deal 
of tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very strong stalk ; 
there were divers other plants, which Ihad no notion of or under- 
standing about, that might, perhaps, have virtues of their own, 
which i could not find out. I searched for the cassava root, which 
the Indians, in all that climate, make their bread of, but I could find 
none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did not understand them. I 
saw several sugar-canes, but wild, and for want of cultivation, im- 
perfect. I contented myself with these discoveries for this lime, and 
came back, musing with myself what course I might take to know 
the virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants which I should 
discover ; but could bring it to no conclusion ; for, in short, I had 
made so little observation while I was in the Brazils, that I knew 
little of the plants in the field ; at least, very little that might serve 
me to any purpose now in my distress. 

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again ; and after 
going something farther than I had gone the day before* I found the 
brook and savannas cease, and the country became more woody 
than before. In this part I found different fruits, and particularly I 
found melons upon the ground, in great abundance, and grapes upon 
the trees ; the vines had spread indeed over the trees, and tlie clusters 
of grapes were just now in their prhne, very ripe and rich. This 
was a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them ; but I 
was warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them, remember- 
ing that when I was ashore in Barbarv, the eating of grapes killed 
several of our Englishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing them 
into fluxes and fevers. But I found an excellent use for these 
grapes ; and that was, to cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them 
as dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would be, as 
indeed tliey were, >vholesome and agreeable to eat, when no grapes 
could lie had. 

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habitation, 
which, by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I had lain 
from home. In the night, I took my first contrivance, and got up 
into a tree, where I slept well ; and the next morning proceeded 
upon my discovery, travelling nearly four miles, as I might judge by 
the length of the valley, k'^^'ning still due north, with a ridge of hills 
on the south and north t> du uf me. At the end of this march I came 






70 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

to an opening, where the countrj'^ seemed to descend to the west ; 
and a liljtle spring of fresh water, which issued out of the side of the 
hill by me, ran the other way — that is, due east ; and the (country ap- 
peared so fresh, so green, so flourishioir, everything being in a con- 
stant verdure, or flourish of spring, that it looked like a planted gar- 
den. I descended a little on the side of that delicious vale, surveying 
it with a secret kind of pleasure, though mixed with my other afflict- 
ing thoughts, to think that this was all my own ; that I was king 
and lord of all this country indefeasibly, and had a right of posses- 
sion ; and, if I could convey it, I might have it in inheritance as 
completely as any lord of a manor in England. I saw here abun- 
dance of cocoa trees, orange, and lemon, and citron trees ; but all 
wild, and very few bearing any fruit — at least, not then. However, 
the green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat but very 
wholesome ; and I mixed their juice afterward with water, which 
made it very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. I found 
now I had business enough, to gather and carry home ; and I re- 
solved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as limes and lemons, to 
furnish myself for the wet season, which I knew was approaching. 
In order to do this, I gathered a gi-eat heap of grapes in one place, a 
lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons 
in another place ; and taking a few of each with me, I travelled 
homeward ; and resolved to come again and bring a bag or sack, or 
what I could make, to carry the rest home. Accordingly, having 
spent three days in this journey, I came home (so I must now call my 
tent and my cave) ; but before 1 got thither the grapes were spoiled ; 
the richness of the fruit and the weight of the juice having broken 
them and bruised them, they were good for little or nothing ; as to 
the limes, they were good, but I could bring but a few. 

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me two 
small bags to bring home my harvest; but I was surprised, when 
coming to my heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when I 

fathered them, I round them all spread about, trod to pieces, and 
ragged about, some here, some there, and abundance eaten and de- 
voured. By this, I concluded there were some wild creatures there- 
about, which had done this ; but what they were I knew not. 
However, as I found there was no laying them up on heaps, and no 
carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they would be de- 
stroyed, and the otner way they would be crushed with their own 
weight, I took another course ; for I gathered a large quantity of the 
grapes and hung them upon the out branches of tlie trees, that they 
might cure and diy in the sun ; and as for the limes and lemons, 1 
cariied as many back as I could well stand under. 

When I came home from this journey I contemplated with great 
pleasure the fruitful ness of that valley and the pleasautness of the 
situation ; the security from storms on that side the water and the 
wood, and concluded that I had pitched upon a place lo fix my abode 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 71 

whicli was by far the worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I 
began to consider of removing my habitation ; and looking out for a 
place equally safe as where now I was situate, if possible, in that 
pleasant, fruitful part of the island. 

This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond of it 
for some time, the pleasantness of the place temptmg me ; but when 
I came to a nearer view of it, I considered that I was now by the 
sea side, where it was at least possible that something might happen 
to my advantage ; and, by the same ill fate that brought me hither, 
might bring some other unhappy wretches to the same place ; and 
though it was scarce probable that any such thing shoulcf ever hap- 
pen, yet to inclose myself among the hills and woods in the centre 
of the island was to anticipate mjr bondage, and to render such an 
affair not only improbable but impossible ; and that therefore I 
ought not by any means to remove. However, I was so enamoured 
of this place that I spent much of my time there for the whole of the 
remaining part of the month of July ; and though, upon second 
thoughts, I resolved not to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a 
bower, and surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence, being a 
double hedge, as high as 1 could reach, well staked, and filled be- 
tween with brushwood ; and here I lay very secure, sometimes two 
or three nights together ; always going over it with a ladder ; so that 
I fancied now I had my country-house and my sea- coast-house ; and 
tMs work took me up to the beginning of August. 

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my labor, 
when the rains came on, and made me stick close to my first habita- 
tion ; for though I had made me a tent like the other, with a piece 
of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the shelter of a hill 
to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat into when 
the rains were extraordinary. 

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my 
bower, and began to enjoy myself. The 3d of August I found the 
grapes I had hung up perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent 
good raisins of the sun ; so I began to take them down from the 
trees, and it was very happy that I did so, for the rains which 
followed would have spoiled them, and I had lost the best part of my 
winter food ; for I had above two hundred large bunches of them. 
No sooner had I taken them all down and carried most of them 
home to my cave but it began to rain ; and from hence, which was 
the t4th of August, it rained, more or less every day, till the middle 
of October ; and sometimes so violently that 1 could not stir out of 
my cave for several days. 

In this season I was much surprised with the increase of my 
family ; I had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, who 
ran away from me, or, as I thought, had been dead, and I heard no 
more, tidings of her till, to m^ astonishment, she came home about 
the end of August with three kittens. This was the more strange to 



r 



TZ ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

me because, tliongh I had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with my 
gun, yet I thought it was a quite different kind from our European 
cats ; but the voung cats were the same kind of house- breed as the 
old one ; and both my cats being females, I thought it very strange. 
But from these three cats I afterward came to be so pestered with 
cuts that I was forced to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, and 
to drive them from my house as much as possible. 

From the 14th of August to the 20th, incessant rain, so that I could 
not stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet. In this con- 
finement I began to be straitened for food : but venturing out 
twice, I one day killed a goat ; and the last day, which was the 26lh, 
found a very large tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my food 
was regulated thus : I ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast ; a 
piece of the goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled ; for, 
to my great misfortune, I had no vessel to boil or stew anything ; and 
two or three of the turtle's eggs for my supper. 

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked dail^ 
two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it 
on toward one side, till I came to the outside of the hill and made a 
door or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall ; and. so I 
came in ana out this way. But I was not perfectly easy at l}ing so 
open ; for, as 1 had managed myself before, I was in a perl'ect in- 
closuro ; whereas now I thought I lav exposed and open lor any- 
thing to come in upon me ; and yet I could not perceive that there 
wasanv living thing to fear ; the biggest creature that I hud yet seen 
upon the islaud being a goat. 

JSept, 80. — I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my land- 
ing. I oust up the notches on mv post, and found I hud been on 
shore three hundred and sixtj^-five days. I kept this day us a solemn 
fast, setting it apart for religious exercise, prostrating m/aelf on tho 
ground with the most serious humiliation, confessm// my sins to 
God, acknowledging his righteous judgments upon me, and praying 
to him to have mercy on me through Jesus Christ ; and not having 
tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, even dU the going 
down of the sun, I then ate a biscuit-cake and a hiiuch of grapes, 
and went to bed, finishing the day as I besan it ] ^ad all this time 
observed no Sabbath-day ; for as at first I had no bense of reli^on 
upon my mind, I had, after some time, omitted t^* distinguish the 
weeks, bv making a longer notch than ordinary fov ihe Sabbath-day, 
and so did nut really know what any of the days were ; but now, 
having cast up the days as above, I found I ha^ Leen there a year ; 
80 1 divided it into weeks, and set apart every neventh day for a 
Sabbath ; though I found at the end of my account I had lost a day 
or tw*o in my r^oning. A little after thb my iuk began to fail me, 
and so I contented myself to use it more sparia^i^r, and to write down 
only the most remarkable events of my ,xtc^ without continuing a 
Uai^r memorandum of other things. 



EOBINSON CRUSOE. 73 

The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular 
to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide for them accord- 
ingly ; hut I bought all my experience before I had it, and this I 
am going to relate was one of the most discouraging experiments 
that I made. 

I have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of barley and rice 
which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of 
themselves, and I believe there were about thirty stalks of nee and 
about twenty of barley ; and now I .thought it a proper time to sow 
it, after the rains, the sun being in its southern position, going from 
me. Accordingly, I dug up a piece of ground as well as I could 
with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my 
grain ; but as I was sowing, it casually occurred to my thouglits 
Uiat I would not sow it all at first, because I did not know when was 
the proper time for it ; so I sowed about two thirds of the seed, leav- 
ing about a handful of each. It was a great comfort to me afterward 
th^t I did so, for not one grain of what I sowed this time came to 
anything : for the dry months following, the earth having had no 
rain after the seed was sown, it had no mtHsture to assist its growth, 
and never came up at all till the wet season had come again, and 
then it grew as if it had been but newly sown. Finding my first 
seed did not grow, whicJi I easily imagmed was by the drcKight, I 
sought for a moister piece of ground to make another trial it , nod I 
dug up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed th^ rest of 
my seed in February, a little before the vernal equinox ; aui this, 
having the rainy months of March and April to water it, spiung up 
very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop ; but having part of 
the seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had, I had bu^ a 
small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half a 
peck of each kind. But by this experiment I was made master of 
my business, and knew exactly when the proper season was to sow, 
and that I might expect two seed times and two harvests every year. 

While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery, which was 
of use to me afterward. As soon as the rains were over, and the 
weather began to settle, which was about the month of November, I 
made a visit up the country to my bower, where, though I had not 
been some months, yet I found all things just as I left them. The 
circle or doable heage that I had made was not only firm and entire, 
but the stakes which I had cut out of some trees that grew there- 
about were all shot out and grown with long branches, as much as 
a willow tree usually shoots the first year after lopping its head. I 
could not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut from. I 
was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the young trees 
grow : and I pruned them, and led them up to grow as much alike 
as I could ; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a figure they 
grew into in three years ; so that though the edge made a circle of 
about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees (for such I might 



74 ROBINSOlir CRUSOE. 

now call them) soon covered it, and it was a complete shade, suffinient 
to lodge under all the dry season. This made me resolve to cut some 
more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a semicircle round 
my wall (I mean that of my first dwelling), which I did ; and placing 
the trees or stakes in a double row, at about eight yards* distance 
from my first fence, they grew presently, and were at first a fine 
cover to my habitation, and afterwaid served for a defence also, as I 
shiill observe in its order. 

I found now that the seasons of the year might generally be di- 
vided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the rainy 
seasons and the dry seasons, which were generally thus : 

The half of February, the whole of March, and the half of April — 
rainy, the sun being then on or near the equinox. 

The half of April, the whole of May, June, and July, and the half 
of August — dry, the sun being then to the north of the Line. 

The half of August, the whole of September, and the half ot Oc- 
tober — rainy, the sun being then come back. 

The half of October, the whole of November, December, and 
January, and the half of February—dry, the sun being then to the 
south of the Line. 

The rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter as the winds 
happened to blow, but this was the general observation I made. 
After I bad found, by experience, the ill consequences of being 
abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions be- 
forehand, that I might not be obliged to go out, and I sat within 
doors as much as possible during the wet months. This time I found 
much employment, and very suitable also to the time, for I found 
great occasion for many things which I had no way to furnish my- 
self with but by hard labor and constant application ; particularly I 
tried many ways to make myself a basket, but all the twigs I could 
get for the purpose proved so brittle that they would do nothing. It 
proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was a boy, I 
used to take great delight in standing at a basket-maker's, in the 
town where my father lived, to see them make their wicker-ware ; 
and being, as boys usually are, very officious to' help, and a great 
observer of the manner in which they worked those things, and 
sometimes lending a hand, I had by these means full knowledge of 
the methods of it, and I wanted nothing but the materials, when it 
came into my mind that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut my 
stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the sallows, willows, 
and osiers in England, and I resolved to try. Accordingly, the next 
day I went to my country-house, as I called it, and cutting some of 
the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I could 
desire ; whereupon I came the next time prepared with a hatchet to 
cut down a quantity, which I soon found, for there was great plenty 
of them. These I set up to dry within my circle or hedge, and when 
they were fit for use 1 carriea them to my cave ; and hero, during 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^ 75 

the next season, I employed myself in making, as well as I could, a 
great many baskets, both to carry earth or to carry or lay up any- 
thing, as I had occasion ; and though I did not finish them very 
handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for my pur- 
pose ; and thus, afterward, I took care never to be without them ; 
and as my wicker-ware decayed I made more, especially strong 
deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of sacks, when I should 
come to have any quantity of it. 

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time 
about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two 
wants. I had no vessel to hold anything that was liquid, except two 
runlets, which were almost full of mm, and some glass bottles — some 
of the common size, and others which were case-bottles, square, for 
the holding of water, spirits, etc. I had not so much as a pot to 
boil aujrthing, except a great kettle, which I saved out of the ship, 
and which was too big for such as I desired it, viz., to malve broth, 
and stew a bit of meat by itself. The second thing I fain would 
have had was a tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible to me to make 
one ; however, I found a contrivance for tliat, too, at last. I em- 
ployed myself in planting my second rows of stakes or piles, and in 
this wicker-working all the summer or dry season, when another 
business took me up more time than it could be imagined I could 
spare. 

I mentioned before that I had a great mind to see the whole island, 
and that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to where I built my 
bower, and where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the other 
side of the island. I now resolved to travel quite across to the sea 
shore on that side ; so taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a 
larger quantity of powder and shot than usual, with two biscuit- 
cakes and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch for my store, I began 
my journey. When I had passed the vale where my bower stood, 
as above, 1 came within view of the sea to the west, and it being a 
very clear day, I fairly descried land— whether an island or a conti- 
nent I could not tell ; but it lay very high, extending from thi'. W. 
to the W.S. W. at a very great distance ; by my guess, it could not be 
less than fifteen or twenty leagues off. 

I could not tell what part of the world this might be, otherwise 
than that I knew it must be part of America, and, as I concluded, by 
all my observations, must be near the Spanish dominions, and per- 
haps was all inhabited by savages, where, if I had landed, I had been 
in a worse condition than I was now ; and therefore I acquiesced in 
the dispositions of Providence, which I began now to own and to be- 
lieve ordered everything for the best ; I say I quieted my mind with 
this, and left off araictmg myself with fruitless wishes of being there. 

Besides, after some thought upon this affair, I considered that if 
this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or 
oilier, see some vessel pass or repass one way or other ; but if not» 



76 ' ROBIKSON CRUSOE. 

then it was the savage coast between the Spanish country and 
Brazils, where are found the worst of savages ; for thev are canni- 
bals, or men-eaters, and fail not to murder and devour au the hum?ui 
bodies that fall into their hands. 

With these considerations, I walked very leisurely forward ; I 
found that side of the islttnd where I now was much pleasanter than 
mine — the open or savanna fields sweet, adorned with flowers and 
grass, and full of very fine woods. I saw abundance of parrots, and 
fain I would have caught one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, 
and taught it to speak to me. I did, af'er some painstaking, catch a 
young parrot, for I knocked it down with a stick, and having re- 
covered it, I brought it home ; but it was some years before I could 
make him speak ; however, at last, I taught him to call me hy my 
name very familiarly But the accident that followed, though it be 
a trifle, will be very diverting in its place. 

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in the low 
grounds hares (as I thought them to be) and foxes ; but they differed 
greatly from all the other kinds I had met wirb, nor could I satisfy 
myself to cat them, though I killed several. But I had no need to be 
venturous, for I had no want of food, and of that which was very 
good, too, especially these three^ sorts, viz., goats, pigeons, and 
turtle, or tortoise, which, added to my grapes, Leadenhall Market 
could not have furnished a table better than I, in proportion to the 
company ; and though my case was deplorable enough, yet I had 
great cause for thankfulness that I was not driven to any extremities 
for food, but had rather plenty, even "to dainties. 

I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a day, 
or thereabout ; but I took so many turns and returns to see what 
discoveries I could make that I came weary enough to the place 
where I resolved to sit down all night ; and then 1 either reposed 
myself in a tree or surrounded myself with a row of stakes set up- 
right in the ground, either from one tree to another, or so as no wild 
creature could come at me without waking me. 

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see that I 
had taken up my lot on the worst side of the islana, for here, indeed, 
the shore was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas on the 
other side I had found but three in a year and a half. Here was also 
an infinite number of fowls of many kinds, some which I had seen, 
and bome which I had not seen before, and many of them very good 
meat, but such as I knew not the names of, except those called penguins. 

1 could hasre shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of 
my powder and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill a she goat, 
if I could, which I could better feed on ; and though there were 
manv goats here, more than on my side the island, yet it was with 
much more difficulty that I could come near them, the country being 
flat and even, and they saw me much sooner than when I was on 
the hilL 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 77 

I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than mine ; 
but yet I had not the least inclination to remove, for as I was fixed 
in my habitation, it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while 
I was here to he as it were upon a journey, and from home. How- 
ever, I travelled along the shore oi the sea toward the east, I sup- 
pose al)out twelve mUes, and then sett'mg up a great pole upon the 
shore for a mark, I concluded I would go home again, and that the 
next journey I took should be on the other side of the island east 
from my dwelling, and so round till I came to my post again. 

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I 
could easily keep all the island so much in my view that I could not 
miss finding my first dwelling by viewing the country ; but I found 
myself mistaken, for, being come about two or three miles, I found 
myself descended into a very large valley, but so surrounded with 
hills, and those hills covered with wood, that I could not see which 
was my way by any dii*ection but that of the sun, nor even then, un- 
less I knew very well the position of the sun at that time of the day. 
It happened, to my further misfortune, that the weatlier proved 
hazy for three or four days while I was in the valley, and not being 
able to see the sun I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at 
last was obliged to find the sea-side, look for my post, and come back 
the same way I went ; and then, by easy ioumeys, I turned 
• homeward, the weather being exceeding hot, and my gun, ammuni- 
tion, hatchet, and other things, very heavy. 

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon it, 
and I, running in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it alive from 
the dog. I had a great mind to bring it home if I could, for I had 
often been musing whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two, 
and so raise a breed of tame goats, which might supply me when my 
pow-der and shot should be all spent. I made a collar for this little 
creature, and with a string, which I made of some rope-yarn, wliicli 
I always carried about me, I led him along, though with some diffi- 
culty, till I came to my bower, and there t inclosed him and left him, 
for I was very impatient to be at home, from whence I had been 
absent above a month. 

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my 
old hutch and lie down in my hammock bed. This little wandering 
journey,* without settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to 
me that my own house, as I called it to myself, was a perfect settle- 
ment to me, compared to that ; and it rendered everything about me 
so comfortable that I resolved I would never go a great way from it 
again, while it should be my lot to stay on the island. 

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after my 
long journey ; during which most of the time was taken up in the 
weighty affair of mt^ing a cage for my Poll, who began now to 1)0 a 
iltere domestic, and to be well acquainted with me. Then I begun to 
think of the poor kid which I had penned in within my little cacle 



78 ROBIKSOK CRUSOE. 

and resolved to so and fetch it home, or give it some food ; accoya- 
ingly I went, and found it where I left it, for indeed it could not get 
out, but was almost starved for want of food. I went and cut bouglis 
of trees and branches Of such shrubs as I could find, and threw it 
over, and having fed it, I tied it as 1 did before, to lead it away ; but 
it was so tame with being hungry that I had no need to have tied 
it, for it followed me like a dog ; and as I continually fed it, the 
creature became so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it became 
from that time one of my domestics also, and would never ieave me 
afterward. 

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I 
kept the 30th of September in the same solemn manner as before, 
bemg the anniversary of my landing on the island, having now been 
there two years, and no more prospect of being delivered than the 
first day I came there. I spent the whole day in humble and thank- 
ful acknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies which my soli- 
tary condition was attended with, and without which it might have 
been infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks 
that God had been pleased to discover to me that it was possible I 
might be more happy in this solitary condition than I should have 
been in the liberty of society, and in all the pleasures of the world : 
that he could fully make up to me the deficiencies of my solitary 
state, and the want of human society, by his presence, and the com- 
munications of his grace to my soul ; supporting, comforting, and 
encouraging me to depend upon his providence here, and hope for 
his eternal presence hereafter. 

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy this 
life I now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than the 
wicked, cui*sed, abominable life I led all the past part of my days ; 
and now I changed both my sorrows and my joys ; my very desires 
altered, my affections changed their gusts, and my delights were 
perfectly new from what they were at my first coming, or, indeed, 
for the two years past. 

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for viewing 
the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out 
upon me on a sudden, and my very heart .would die within me, to think 
of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in, and how I was a 
[prisoner, locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in 
an uninhabited wilderness, without redemption. In the fhidst of 
the greatest composure of my mind, this would break out upon me 
like a storm, and make me wring my hands and weep like a child ; 
sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work, and I w^ould 
immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the ground for an 
hour or two together ; and this was still worse to me, for if I' could 
burst out into tears, or vept myself by words, it would go off, &n,d the 
grief, having exhausted itself, would abate. 

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughte ; I Ottily 



KOBINSOK CRUSOE. 79 

read the "Word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my pres- 
ent state. One morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible upon 
these words : ** I will never, never leave thee, nor forsake tliee.*' 
Immediately it occurred that these words were to me ; why else 
should they be directed in such a manner, just at the moment when 
I was mourning over my condition, as one forsaken of God and 
man? " Well, then,'* said I, "if God does not forsake mc, of what 
ill consequence can it be, or what matters it, though the world should 
all forsake me, seeing on the other hand, if I had all the" world, and 
should lose the favor and blessing of God, there would be no com- 
parison in the loss ?" 

From this moment I began to conclude in my mind, that it was 
possible for me to be^more happy in this forsaken, solitary condition 
than it was probable I should ever have been in any other particular 
state in the world ; and with this thought I was going to ^ve thanks 
to God for bringiug me to this place. I know not what it was. but 
something shocked my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak 
the words. "How canst thou become such a hypocrite,'* said I, 
even audibly, ** to pretend to be thankful for a condition which, 
however thou mayst endeavor to be contented with, thou wouldst 
rather pray heartily to be delivered from?" So I stopped there; 
but though I could not say I thanked God for being there, yet I sin- 
cerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting 
providences, to see the former condition of my life, and to mourn 
for my wickedness and repent. I never opened the Bible, or shut 
It, but my very soul within me blessed God for directing my friend 
in England, without any order of mine, to pack it' up among my 
goods, and for assisting me afterward to save it out of tlie wreck of 
the ship. 

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year ; and 
though I have not given the reader the trouble of so particular an 
account of my works this year as the first, yet in general it may be 
observed that I was very seldom idle, but having regularly divided 
my time according to the several daily employments that were before 
me, such as, first, my duty to God, and the reading the Scrip- 
tures, which I constantly set apart some time for, thrice every day ; 
secondly, the going abroad with my guh for food, which generally 
took me up three hours in every morning, when it did not rain ; 
thirdly, the ordering, cutting, preserving, and cooking, what I had 
killed or caught for my supply : these took up great part of the 
day ; also it is to be considered, that in the middle of the day, when 
the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too great to 
stir out ; so that about four hours in the evening was all the time I 
could be supposed to work in, with this exception, that sometimes I 
changed my liours of hunting and working, and went to work in the 
mormng, and abroad with my gun in the afternoon. 

To thif short tinie allowed for fabpr J desjre may be added the 




80 BOBINSOK CRUSOE. 

exceeding laboriousness of my work ; the many hmirs which, for 
want of tools, want of help, and want of skill, everything I did took 
up out of my time : for example, I was full two-and-forty days in 
making a board for a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave ; 
whereas, two sawyers, with their tools and a saw-pit, would have cut 
six of them out of the same tree in half a day. 

My case was this : it was to be a large tree which was to be cut 
down, because my board was to be a broad one. This tree I was 
three days in cutting down, and two more cutting off the boughs 
and reducing it to a log or piece of timber. With inexpressible 
hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it into chips till it 
began to be light enough to move ; then I turned it, and made one 
side of it smooth and flat as a board from end to end ; then turning 
that side downward, cut the other side till I brought the plank to be 
about three inches thick and smooth on both sides. Any one may 
judge the labor of my hands in such a piece of work ; but lal>or and 
patience carried me through that, and many other things ; I only 
observe this in particular, to show the reason why so much of my 
time went away with so little work, viz., that what might be a little 
to be done, with help and tools, was a vast labor and required a pro- 
digious time to do alone, and bj'^ hand. But notwithstanding; this, 
with patience and labor I got through everything that my circum- 
stances made necessary to me to do, as will appear by what follows. 

i was now, in the months of November and December, expecting 
my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had manured and dug up 
for them was not great ; for, as I observed, my seed of each was n(»t 
above the quantity of half a peck, for I had lost one whole crop by 
sowing in the dry season : but now my crop promised very well, when 
on a sudden I found I was in danger of losing it all again by enemies 
of several sorts, which it was scarcely possible to keep from it ; as, 
first the goats, and wild creatures which I called hares, who, tasting 
the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it came 
up, and ate it so close that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk. 
This I saw no remedv for but by making an inclosure about it with 
a hedge ; which I did with a great deal of toil, and the more because 
it required speed. However, as my arable land was but small, suited 
to my crop, I got it totally well fenced in about three weeks' time ; 
* and shootmg some of the creatures in the daytime, I set my dog to 
guard it in the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he 
would stand and bark all night long ; so in a little time the enemies 
forsook the place, and the com grew very strong and well, and be- 
gan to ripen apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my com was in the 
blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the 
ear ; for going along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my 
little crop surrounded with fowls, of I know not how many sorts, 
who stocKl, as it were, watching till I should be ^one. I immediately 



R0BIK80N CRUSOE. 81 

let fly among them, for I always had my gun with me. I had no 
sooner sliot but there rose up a little cloud of fowls, which I had 
not seen at all, from among the corn itself. 

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they 
would devour all my hopes ; that I should be starved, and never iJo 
able to raise a crop at all ; and what to do I could not tell ; however, 
I resolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though I should watch it 
night and day. In the first place, I went among it to see what 
damage was already done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of 
it ; but that as it was yet too green for them, the loss was not so 
great but that the remamder was likely to be a good crop, if it could 
be saved. 

I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could easily 
see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they only 
waited till I was gone away, and the event proved it to be so ; for as 
I walked off, as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of their sight 
than they dropped down one by one into the com again. I was so 
provoked that I could not have patience to stay till more came on. 
knowing that every grain they ate aow was, as it might be said, a 
peck-loaf to me in the consequence ; but coming up to the hedge I 
fired again, and killed three of them. This was what I wished lor ; 
so I took them up and served them as we serve notorious thieves in 
England — hanged them in chains, for a terror to others. It is im- 
possible to imagine that this should have such im effect as it had, for 
the fowls would not only not come at the corn, but, in short, they 
forsook all that part of the island, and I could never see a bird near 
the place as long as my scarecrows hung there. This I was very 
glad of, you may be sure, and about the latter end of December, 
which was our second harvest of the year, I reaped my com. 

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down, and all 
I could do was to make one, as well as I could, out of one of the 
broadswords or cutlasses which I saved among the arms out of the 
ship. However, as my first crop was but small, I had no great diffi- 
culty to cut it down ; in short, 1 reaped it in my way, for 1 cut noth- 
ing off but the ears, and carried it away in a great basket which I 
had made, add so rubbed it out with my hands ; and at the end of 
all my harvesting I found that out of my half peck of seed I had 
near two bushels of rice, and about two bushels and a half of barley ; 
that is to say, by my guess, for I had no measure at that time. 

However, this was a great encouragement to me, wid I foresaw 
that, in time, it would please God to supply me with bread : and yet 
here I was perplexed again, for I neither knew how to grind or 
make meal of my com, or, indeed, how to clean it and part it ; nor, 
if made into meal, how to make bread of it ; and if how to make it, 
yet I knew not how to bake it : these things being added to my 
desire of having a good quantity for store, and to secure a constant 
supply, I resolved not to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all 



82 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

for seed against the next season ; and, in the mean time, to employ 
all my study and hours of working to accomplish this great work of 
providing myself with corn and bread. 

It might be truly said that now I worked for my bread. I believe 
few people have thought much upon tlie strange multitude of little 
things necessary in the providing, producing, curing, dressing, mak- 
ing, and finishing this one article of bread. 

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to my 
daily discouragement, and was made more sensible of it every hour, 
even after I had got the first handful of seed-corn, which, as I have 
said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise. 

First, I had no plough to turn up the earth ; no spade or shovel to 
dig it. Well, this I conquered by making me a wooden spade, as I 
observed before ; but this did my work but in a wooden manner ; 
and though it cost me a great many days to make it, yet for want of 
non it not only wore out soon but made my work the harder, and 
made it be performed much worse. However, this I bore with, and 
was content to work it out with patience, and bear with the badness 
of the performance. When the corn was sown, I had no harrow, ~ 
but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a great heavy bough 
of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be called, rather than rake or 
harrow it. When it was growing, and grown, I have observed al- 
ready how many things I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or reap 
it, cure and carry it home, thrash, part it from the chaff, and save it. 
Then I Avanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to 
make it into bread, and an oven to bake it ; but all these things I 
did without, as shall be observed ; and yet the com was an inestima- 
ble comfort and advantage to me too. All this, as I said, made 
everything laborious and tedious to me ; but that there was no help 
for ; neither was my time so much loss to me, because, as I harl di- 
vided it, a certain part of it was every day appointed to these works ; 
and as I had resolved to use none of the corn for bread till I had a 
greater quantity by me, I had the next six months to apply myself 
wholly, by laoor and invention, to furnish myself with utensils 
proper for the performing all the operations necessary for making the 
corn, when I had it, fit for my use. 

But first I was to prepare more land, for I had new seed enough to 
sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had a week's 
work at least to make me a spade, which, when it was done, was 
but a sorry one indeed, and veiy heavy, and required double labor to 
work with it. However, I got through that, and sowed my seed in 
two large fiat pieces of ground, as near my house as I could find 
thcra to my mind, and fenced them in with a good hedge, the stakes 
of which were all cut off that wood which I had set before, and 
knew it would grow ; so that, in one year's time, I knew I should 
have a quick or living hedge, that would want but little repair. 
This work did not take me up less thau three months, because a 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 83 

great part of that time was the wet season, when I could not go 
abroad. Within doors, that is, when it rained, and I could not gi> 
out, I found employment in the following occupations— always ob- 
serving, that all the while I was at work, I diverted myseli with 
talking to my parrot, and teaching him to speak ; and I quickly 
taught him to know his own name, and at last to speak it out pretty 
loud. Poll, which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the island 
by any mouth but my own. This, therefore, was not my work, but 
an assistance to my work ; for now, as I said, I had a great employ- 
ment upon my hands, as follows : I had long studied to make, by 
some means or other, some earthen vessels, which, indeed, I wanted 
sorely, but knew not where to come at them. However, considering 
the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any 
clay, I might make some pots that might, being dried in the sun, be 
hard enough and strong enough to bear handlinr, and to hold any- 
thing that was dry, and required to ha kept so ; and as this was 
necessary in the preparing corn, meal, etc., which was the thing I 
was doing, I resolved to make some as large as I could, and fit only 
to stand like jars, to hold what should be put into them. 

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell 
how many awkward ways I took to raise this paste ; what odd, mis- 
shapen, ugly things I made ; how many of them fell in, and how 
many fell out, the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own 
weight ; how many cracked by the over-violent heat of the sun, bemg 
set out too hastily ; and how many fell in pieces with only remov- 
ing, as well before as after they were dried ; and, in a word, how, 
after having labored hard to find the clay — to dig it, to temper it, to 
bring it home, and work it — I could not make above two large 
earthen ugly things (I cannot call them jars) in about two mouths* 
labor. 

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I lifted 
them very gently up, and set them down again in two great wickei 
baskets, which 1 had made on purpose for them, that they might not 
break ; and as between the pot and the basket there was a little room 
to spare, I stuffed it full of the rice and barley straw ; and these two 
pots being to stand always dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, 
and perhaps the mial, when the corn was bruised. 

Though 1 miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet I 
made several smaller things with better success ; such as little round 
pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any things my hand 
turned to ; and the heat of the sun baked them quite hard. 

But all this would not answer ray end, which was to get an earthen 
pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the fire, which none of these 
could do. It happened after some time, making a pretty large fire 
for cooking my meat, when I went to put it out after I had done 
with it, I K>uud a broken piece of one of my earthenware vessels in 
the fire, burned as hard as a stone and red as a tile. I was agreeably 



84 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



surprised to see it, and said to myself, that certainly they might be 
made to bum whole if they would burn broken. 

This set me to study how to order my fire so as to make it bum 
some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters burn in, or 
of glazing them with lead, though I had some lead to do it with ; 
but I placed three large pipkins and two or three pots in a pile, one 
upon another, and placed my firewood all round it with a great heap 
of embers under them. I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the 
outside and upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot 
quite through, and observed that they did not crack at all ; when I 
saw them clear red, I let them stand in that heat about five or six 
hours, till I found one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or 
run ; for the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by the vio- 
lence of the heat, and would have run into glass if I had gone on ; so 
I slacked my fire gradually till the pots began to abate of the red 
color, and watching them all night, that I might not let the fire abate 
too fast, in the morning I had three very good (I will not say hand- 
some) pipkins, and two other earthen pots, as hard burned as could 
be desired, and one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the 
sand. 

After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of 
earthenware for my use ; but I must needs say as to the shapes of 
them, they were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, when I 
had no way of making them but as the children make dirt pies, or as 
a woman would make pies that never learned to raise paste. 

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine, 
when I found I had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire ; 
and I had hardly patience to stay till they were cold, before I set 
one on the fire again, with some water in it, to boll me some 
meat, which it did admirably well ; and with a piece of a kid I made 
some very good broth, though I wanted oatmeal and several other 
ingredients requisite to make it as good as I would have had it been. 

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat 
some corn in ; for as to the mill, there was no thought of aniving at 
that perfection of art with one pair of hands. * To supply this want, 
I was at a great loss ; for, of all the trades in the world. 1 was as per- 
fectly unqualified for a stone-cutter as for any whatever ; neither 
had I any tools to go about it with. I spent many a day to find out 
a great stone big enough to cut hollow and make fit for a morlar. 
and could find none at all, except what was in the solid rock, and 
which 1 had no way to dig or cut out ; nor indeed were the rocks in 
the island of hardness sufficient, but were all of a sandy ciumbling 
stone, which neither would bear the weight of a heavy pestle nor 
would break the com without filling it with sand ; so, after a great 
deal of time lost in searching for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved 
to look out for a great block of hard wood, which I found indeed 
much easier ; and getting one as big as I had strength to stir, I

rounded it, and formed it on the oatside with my axe and hntchct, 
and then, with the help of fire, and infinite labor, made a hullow 
place in it, as the Indians in Brazil make their canoes. After this, I 
made a great heavy pestle, or beater, of the wood called the iron- 
wood ; and this I prepared and laid by against I had my next crop 
of com, which I proposed to myself to grinds or rather pound, into 
meal, to make bread. 

My next difliculty was to make a sieve, or searce, to dress my meal, 
and to part it from the bran and the husk, without which I did not 
see it possible I could have any bread. This was a most difficult 
thing, even to think on, for to be sure I had nothing like the necessary 
thing to make it ; I mean fine thin canvas, or stuff, to searce the meal 
through. And here 1 was at a full stop for many months ; nor did I 
really know what to do. Linen I had none left but what was mere 
rags ; I had goat's-hair, but neither knew how to weave it or spin it ; 
and had I known how, here were no tools to work it with. All the 
remedy that I found for this was, that at last T did remember I had, 
among the seamen's clothes which were saved out of the ship, some 
neckcloths of calico or muslin ; and with some pieces of these I made 
three small sieves proper enous^h for the work ; and thus I made 
shift for some years : how I did afterward I shall show in its place. 

The baking part was the next, thing to be considered, and how I 
should make bread when I came to have com ; for, first, I had no 
yeast ; as to that part, there was no supplying the want, so I did not 
concern myself much about it. But for an oven, I was indeed in 
great pain. At length I found out an experiment for that also, which 
was this : I made some earthen vessels very broad, but not deep— that 
is to say, about two feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep ; 
these 1 burned in the fire, as I had done the other, and laid them by ; 
and when I wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon my hearth, 
which I had paved with some square tiles, of my own baking and 
burning also ; but I should not call them square. 

When the firewood was burned pretty much into embers, or live 
coals, I drew them forward upon this hern'ih, so as to cover it all 
over, and there I let them lie till the hearth was very hot : then 
sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf or loaves, and 
whelming down the earthen pot upon them, drew the embers all 
round the outside oT the i)ot, to keep in and add to the heat ; and 
thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my barley- 
loaves, and became, in little time, a good pasiiy-cook into the bar- 
fiin ; for I made mvself several cakes and pudaings of the rice ; but 
made no pies, neither had I anything to put into them, supposing 
I had, except the flesh either of fowls or goats. 

It need not be wondered at if all these things took me up most 
part of the third year of my abode here ; for it is to be observed 
that in the intervals of these things, I had my new harvest and hus- 
bandly to manage ; for I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it 



86 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

home as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear, in my h\rge bas- 
kets, till I had time to rub it out, for I had no floor to thrash it on, 
or instrument to thrash it with. 

And now, indeed, my stock of com increasing, I reallj'- wanted to 
build my barns bigter ; I wanted a place to lay it up in, for the in- 
crease of the com now yielded me so much that I had of the barley 
about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or more ; insomuch 
that now I resolved to begin to use it freely ; for my bread had been 
quite gone a great while ; also I resolved to see what quantity would 
•be sufficient for me a whole year, and to sow but once a year. 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and rice 
were much more than I could consume in a year : so I resolved to 
sow just the same quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes 
that such a quantity would fully provide me with bread, etc. 

All the while these things were doing, vou may be sure my 
tlioughts ran many times upon the prospect of land which I had seen 
from the other side of the island ; and I was not without secret 
wishes that I were on shore there, fancying that, seeing the main- 
land, and an inhabited country, I might find some way or other to 
convey myself farther, and perhaps at last find some means of 
escape. 

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such an 
undertaking, and how I might fall into the hands of savages, and 
perhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse than the lions 
and tJgers of Africa ; that if I once came in their power, I should 
run a hazard of more than a thousand to one of being killed, and 
perhaps of being eaten ; for I had heard that the people of the Car- 
ibbean coast were cannibals, or man-eaters, and I knew by the lati- 
tude that I could not be far from that shore. Then, supposing they 
were not cannibals, yet they might kill me, as many Europeans who 
had fallen into their hands had been served, even when they had 
been ten or twenty together — much more I, that was but one, and 
could make little or no defence : all these things, I say, which I 
ought to have considered well, and did come into my thoughts after- 
ward, yet gave me no apprehensions at first, and my head ran 
mightily upon the thought of getting over to the shore. 

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the 
shoulder-of mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand rftiles 
on the coast of Africa ; but this was in vain : then I thought I would 
go and look at our ship's boat, which, as I have said, was blown up 
upon the shore a great way, in the storm, when we were first cast 
away. She lay almost were she did at first, but not quite ; and was 
turned, by the force of the waves and the winds, almost bottom up- 
ward, against a high ridge of beachy, rou^h sand, but no wxiter 
about her. If I had had hands to have retitted her, and to have 
launched her into the water, the boat would have done well enough, 
and I might have gone back into the Brazils with her easily enough ; 



ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 87 

but I might have foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her 
upright upon her bottom than I could remove the island ; however, 
I went to the woods and cut levers and rollers, and brought them to 
the boat, resolving to try what I cojild do ; suggesting to my«elf 
that if I could but turn her down I might repair the damage she had 
received, and she would be a very good boat, and I might go to sea 
m her very easily. 

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent, 
I tliink, three or four weeks about it ; at last, finding it impossible 
to heave it up with my little streogth, I fell to digging away the sand, 
to undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting pieces of wood 
to thrust and guide it right in the fall. 

But when I had done this I was unable to stir it up again, or to 
get under it, much less to move it forward toward the water ; so I 
was forced to give it over ; and yet, though I gave over the hopes of 
the boat, my desire to venture over the main increased, rather than 
decreased, as the means for it seemed* impossible. 

This at length put me upon thinking wliether it was not possible 
to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those 
climates make, even without tools, or, a^ I might say, without hands, 
of the trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought possible but 
easy, and pleased myself extremely with the thoughts of making it, 
and with my having mucli more convenience for it than any of the 
negroes or Indians ; but not at all considering the particular incon- 
veniences which I lay under more than the Indians did, viz. , want 
of hands to move it, when it was made, into the water— a difficulty 
much harder for me to surmount than all the consequences of want 
of tools could be to them ; for what was it to me, if when I had 
chosen a vast tree in the woods, and with much trouble cut it down, 
if I had been able with my tools to hew and dub the outside into the 
proper shape of a l)oat, and bum or cut out the inside to make it 
hollow, so as to make a boat of it — if, after all this, 1 must leave it 
just there where I found it, and not be able to launch it into the 
water ? 

One would have thought I could not have had the least reflection 
upon my mind of my circumstances while I was making this boat, 
but I should have inmiediately thought how I should get it into the 
sea ; but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over the sea 
in it that I never once considered how I should get it off the land ; 
and it was really, in its own nature, thore easy for me to guide it over 
forty-five miles in sea than about forty-five fathoms of land, where 
it lay, to set it afloat in the water. 

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man 
did who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with the 
design, without determining whether I was ever able to undertake 
it ; not but that the difficulty of launching my boat came often into 
my head ; but I put a stop to my inquiries into it by this foolish 



88 BOBINSOK CRUSOE. 

answer which I gave myself : ** Let me firsUmake it ; I warrant I 
will find some way or other to get it along when it is done.*' 

This was a most preposterous method ; but the eagerness of mT 
fancy prevailed, and to work 1 went. I felled a cedar- tree, and I 
question much whether Solomon ever had such a one for the building 
of the Temple of Jerusalem ; it was five feet ten inches diameter at 
the lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter 
at the end of twenty- two feet ; after which it lessened for ri while, 
and then parted into branches. It was not without infinite labor 
that I felled this tree ; I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it 
at the bottom ; I was fourteen more gettinsr the branches and limbs 
and the vast spreading head cut off, which I hacked and hewed 
through with axe and hatchet, and inexpressible labor : after this, it 
cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to some- 
thing like the bottom of a boat, tliat it might swim upright as it 
oueht to do. It cost me near three months more to clear ihe inside, 
and work it out so as to make an exact boat of it : this I did, inde^, 
without fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard 
]aI>or, till I had brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and big 
enough to have carried six-and-twenty men, and consequently big 
enough to have carried me and all my cai^o. 

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted 
with it. The boat was really much bigger than ever I saw a canoe 
or periagua, that was made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary 
stroke it had cost, you may be sure ; and had I gotten it into the 
water, I make no question but I should have begun the maddest 
voyage, and the most unlikely to be performed, tliat ever was under- 
taKcn. 

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me, though they 
cost me infinite labor too. It lay about one hundred yards from the 
water, and not more ; but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill 
toward the creek. Well, to take away this discouragement, I re- 
solved to dig into the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity : 
this I began, and *it cost me a prodigious deal of pains (but who 
grudges pains that have their deliverance in view ?) ; but when this 
was worked throuirh, and this difiiculty managed, it was still much 
the same, for I could no more stir the canoe than I could the other 
boat. Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut 
a dock or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeinit I could 
not bring the canoe down to theT water. Well, I began tins work ; 
and when I began to enter upon it, and calculate how deep it was to 
be dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be thrown out, I found 
that,, by the number of hands I had, being none but my own, it roust 
have been ten or twelve ^«ars before I could have gone tlu*ough with 
it ; for the shore lay so high that at the upper end it must have been 
at least twenty feet deep ; so at length, though with great reluctancy, 
I gave this attempt over also. 



BOBIKSON CRUSOE. 89 

V 

This grieved me heartily ; and now I saw, though too late, the 
folly of beginning a work before we count the co8t, and before we 
judge rightly of our own strength to go through with it. 

In the middle of this work I finished mv fourth year in this place, 
and kept jay anniversary with the same devotion, and with as much 
comfort as ever before ; for, by a constant study and serious applica- 
tion to the Word of God, and by the assistance of his grace, I gained 
a different, knowledge from what I had before. I entertained differ- 
ent notions of things. I looked now upon the world as a thing re- 
mote, which I bad nothing to do with, no expectation from, and, 
indeed, no desires about : in a word, I had nothing indeed to do with 
it, nor was ever likely to have ; so I thought it looked, as we may 
perhaps look upon it hereafter, viz., as a place I had lived in, but 
was come out of it ; and well might I say, as Father Abraham to 
Dives. ** Between me and thee is a great gulf fixed." 

In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the 
world here ; I had neither the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, 
nor the pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was 
now capable of enjoying ; I was lord of the whole manor ; or, if I 
pleased, I might call myself king or emperor over the whole country 
which I had possession of : there were no rivals ; I had no competi- 
tor, none tOkdispute sovereignty or command with me : I might have 
raised ship-loadings of corn, but I bad no use for it ; so I let as little 
grow as I thought enough for my occasion. I had tortoise or turtle 
enough, but now and then one was as much as I could put to any 
use : I had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships ; and I had 
grapes euough to have made wine, or to have cured into raisins, to 
have loaded that fleet when it had been built. 

But all I could make use of was all that was valuable : I had 
enough to eat and supply my wants, and what was all the rest to me ? 
If I killed more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or 
vermin ; if I sowed more corn than I could cat, it must be spoiled ; 
the trees that I cut down were lying to rot on the ground ; I could 
make no more use of them but for fuel, and that I had no occasion 
for but to dress my food. 

In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated tome, upon 
just reflection, that all the good things of this world are no further 
good to us than they are for our use ; and that, whatever we may 
heap up to give others, we enjoy just as much as we can use, and no 
more. The most covetous, griping miser in the world would have 
been cured of the vice of covetousness if he had been in my case ; for 
I possessed infinitely more than I knew what to do with. I had no 
room for desire, except it was of things which I had not, and they 
were but trifles, though, indeed, of great use to me. I had, as I 
hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold as silver, about thirty- 
six pounds sterling. Alas I there the sorry, useless stuff lay ; I had 
no manner of business for it ; and often thought with myself that I 



90 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

would have given a handful of it for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or 
for a hand-mill to grind my corn ; nay, I would have given it all for 
a sixpenny vjrorth of turnip and carrot seed out of England, or for a 
handful of peas and beans and a bottle of ink. As it was. I had not 
the least advantage by it or benefit from it ; but there it lay in a 
drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave in the wet 
seasons ; and if I had had the drawer full of diamonds it had been 
the same case— they had been of no manner of value to me, because 
of no use. 

I had now broueht my state of life to be much easier in itself than 
it was at first, anamuch easier to my mind as well as to my body. 
I frequently sat down to meat with thanlifulness, and admired the 
hand of God*s providence, which had thus spread my table in the 
wilderness. I learned to look more upon the bright side of my con- 
dition and less upon the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed 
rather than what I wanted ; and this gave me sometimes such secret 
comforts that I cannot express them ; and which I take notice of 
here, to put those discontented people in mind of it, who cannot c.v- 
j(^ comfortably what God has given them, because they see }.nd 
covet something that he has not given them. All our discontents 
about what we want appeared to me to spring from the want of 
thankfulness for what we have. 

Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless woulrl be 
so to any one that should fall into such distress as mine was ; and 
this was, to compare my present condition with what 1 at first ex- 
pected it would be ; nay. with what it would ceilainly have been if 
the good providence of God had not wonderfully ordered the skip to 
be cast up nearer to the shore, where I not only could come at her, 
but could bring what I got out of her to the shore, for my relief and 
comfort ; without which I had wanted for tools to work, weapons 
for defence, and gunpowder and shot for getting my food. 

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to 
myself, in the most lively colors, how I must have acted if I had got 
nothing out of the ship ; how I could not have so much as sot any 
food, except fish and turtles ; and that, as it was long before I found 
any of them, I must have perished first ; that I should have lived, if 
I had not perished, like a mere savage ; that if I had killed a goat 
or a fowl, by any contrivance, I had no way to flay or open it, or 
part the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up ; but must 
gnaw it with my teeth and pull it with my claws, like a beast. 

These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of Provi- 
dence to me, and very thankful for my present condition, with all its 
hardships and misfortunes : and this part also I cannot but recom- 
mend to the reflection of those who are apt, in their misery, to say, 
** Is any afliiction like mine V* Let them consider how much worse 
the cases of some people are, and their case might have been, if Prov- 
idence had thought fit. 



KOBINSOK CRUSOE. 91 

I had another reflectioD, which assisted me also to comfort mv 
mind with hopes ; and this was comparing my present situation with 
what I had deserved, and had therefore reason to expect from tiie 
hand of Providence. I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly destitute 
of the knowledge and fear of God. I had heen well instructed by 
father and mother ; neither had they been wanting to me, in their 
early endeavors to infuse a religious awe of God into my mind, a 
sense of my duty, and what the nature and end of my being required 
of me. But alas I falling early into the seafaring life, which of all 
lives is the most destitute of the feai* of God, though his terrors ar6 
always before them ; I say, falling early into the seafaring life, and 
into seafaring company, all that little sense of religion which I had 
entertained was laughed out of me by my messmates ; by a hardened 
despising of dangers, and the views of death, which grew habitual 
to me ; by my long absence from all manner of opportunities to con- 
verse witli anything but what was like myself, or to hear anything 
that was good or tended toward it. 

So void was I of everything that was good, or the least sense of 
what I was, or was to be, that, in the greatest deliverances I enjoyed 
— such as my escape from Sallee ; my being taken up by the Portu- 
guese master of the ship ; my being planted so well in the Brazils ; 
my receiving the cargo from England, and the like— I never had once 
the words, ** Thank God," so much as on my mind, or in my 
mouth ; nor in the greatest distress had I so much as a thought to 
pray to him, or so much as to say, ** Lord, have mercy upon me !*' 
no, nor to mention the name of God, unless it was to swear by and 
blaspheme it. 

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I 
have already observed, on account of my wicked and hardened life 
past ; and when I looked about me, and considered what particular 
providences had attended me since my coming into this place, and 
how God had dealt bountifully with me — had not only punished me 
less than my iniquity had deserved, but had so plentifully provided 
for me, this gave me great hopes that my repentance was accepted, 
and that God had yet mercy in store for me. 

With these reflections, I worked my mind up, not only to a resig- 
nation to the will of God in the present disposition of my circum 
stances, but even to a sincere thankfulness for my condition ; and 
that I, who was yet a living man, ought not to complain, seeing I 
had not the due punishment of my sms ; that I enjoyed so many 
mercies which I had no reason to have expected in that place ; that 
I ought never more to repine at my condition, but to rejoice, and to 
give daily thanks for that daily bread which nothing but a crowd of 
wonders could have brought ; that I ought to consider I had been 
fed even by a miracle, even as great as that of feeding Elijah by 
ravens ; nay, by a long series of miracles ; and that I could hardly 
have named a place in the uninhabitable part of the world whei*el 



9^ ROCIXSOIS" CRUSOE, 

could have been cast more to my advantage ; a placb where, as I had 
no society, which yas my affliction on one hand, so I found no 
ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten my life ; no 
^venomous creatures or poisons, which I might feed on to my hurt ; 
no savages to murder and devour me. In a word, as my life was a 
life of sorrow one way, so it was a life of mercy another ; and I 
wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort but to be able to make 
my sense of God's goodness to me and care over me in this condi- 
tion l)e my daily consolation ; and after I did make a just improve- 
ment of these Ihiogs, I went away, and was no more sad. I had 
now beea here so long that many things which I had brought on 
shore for|jiy help were either quite gone or very much wastSi and 
near spent! 

My ink, as I observed, had been g:one some time, all but a very 
little, which I eked out with water, a little and a little, till it was so 
pale it scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper. As long 
as it lasted I made use of it to minute down the days of the month 
on which any remarkable thing happened to me ; andtlrst, by casting 
lip times past, I remembered that there was a strange concurrence 
of days in the various providences which befell me, and which, if I 
had been superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortu- 
nate, I might have had reason to have looked upon with a great deal 
of curiosity. 

First, 1 had observed that the same da^ that I broke away from 
my father and friends, and ran away to Hull in order to go to sea, 
the same day afterward I was taken by the Sallee man-of-war and 
made a i^lave ; the same day of the year that I escaped out of the 
wreck of that ship in Yarmouth Roads, that same day year after- 
ward I made my escape from Sallee in a boat ; the same day of the 
year I was born on, viz., the 30th of September, that same day I had 
my life so miraculously saved twenty-six yeare after, when I was 
cast on shore in this island ; so that my wicked Ufe and my solitary 
life began both on a day. 

The next tiling to my ink being wasted was that of my bread ; I 
mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship : this I had hus- 
banded to the last degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a 
day for above a year f and yet I was quite without bread for near a 
year before I got any corn of my own ; and great reason 1 had to be 
thankful that I had any at all, the getting it being, as has been 
already observed, next to miraculous. 

Mv clothes, too, began to decay ; as to linen, I had had none a 
goou while, except some checkered shirts which I found in the 
chests of the other seamen, and which I carefully preserved ; because 
many times I could bear no other clothes on but a shirt ; and it was 
a very great help to me that I had, among all the men's clothes of 
the ship, almost three dozen of shirts. There were also, Indeed, sev- 
eral thick watch-coats of the seamen's which were left, but they were 



EOBINSOiq^ CRUSOE* 93 

too hot to wear ; and though it is Uae that the weather was so vio- 
lently hot that tiiere was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite 
naked — no, though I had been inclined to it, which 1 was not ; nor 
could I abide the thought of it, though I was alone. The reason 
why I could not go naked was, I could not bear the heat of the sun 
so well when quite naked as with some clothes on ; nay, the very 
heat frequently blistered my skin ; whereas, with a shirt on, the air 
itself made some motion, and whistling under the shirt, was twofold 
cooler than without it. No more could I ever bring myself to go out 
in the heat of the sim without a cap or a hat ; the heat of the sun, 
beating with such violence as it does in that place, would give me 
the headache presently, by darting so directl^r on my head, without 
a cap or hat on, so that I could not bear it ; whereas, if I pvit 
on my hat, it would presently go away. 

Upon these views I began to consitfer about putting the few rags 
I had, which I called clothes, into some order ; I had worn out all 
the waistcoats 1 had, and my business was now to try if I could not 
make jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by me, and 
with such other materials as I had ; so I set to work, tailoring, or 
rather, indeed, botching, for I made most piteous work of it. How- 
ever, I made shift to make two or three new waistcoats, which I 
hoped would serve me a great while ; as for breeches or drawers, I 
made but a very sorry shift indeed till afterward. 

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures that I 
killed, I mean four-footed ones, and I had them hung up stretched 
out with sticks in the sun, by which means some of them were so 
dry and hard that they Were fit for little, but others were very use- 
ful. The first thing I made of these was a great cap for my head, 
with the hair on the outside, to shoot oflf the rain ; and this I per- 
formed so well that, after, I made me a suit of clothes wholly of 
these skins— that is to say, a waistcoat, and breeches open at the 
knees, and both loose, for they were rather wanting to keep me cool 
than to keep me warm. I must not omit to acknowledge that they 
were wretchedly made ; for if I was a bad carpimter, I was a worse 
tailor. However, they were such as I made ver^ good shift with, 
and when I was out, if it happened to rain, the hair of my waistcoat 
and cap bein^ outermost, I was kept very dry. 

After this, I spent a great deal of time ana pains to make an um- 
brella ; I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great mind to 
make one : I had seen them made in the Brazils, where they are 
very useful in the great heats there, and I felt the heats every jot as 
great here, and greater too, being nearer the equinox ; besides, as I 
was obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as 
well for the rains as the heats. I took a world of pains with it, and 
was a great while before I could make aqything likely to hold : nay, 
after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I mane 
one to my mind : but at hist I 'made one that answered indifferently 



94 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

well ; the main difficulty I found was to make it let down. I could 
make it spread, but if it did not let down too, and draw in, it was 
not portable for me any way but just over my head, which would 
not do. However, at last, as I said, I made one to answer, and cov- 
ered it with skins, the hair upward, so that it cast off the rain like a 
pent- house, and kept off the sun so effectually that I could walk out 
in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than I could 
before in the coolest, and when I had no need of it, could close it 
and carry it under my arm. 

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely com- 
posed by resigning myself to the will of God, and throwing myself 
wholly upon the disposal of his providence. This made my life 
better than sociable, for when I began to regret the want of conversa- 
tion. I would ask myself whether thus conversing mutually with my 
own thoughts, and (as I hope I may say) with even God himself, by 
ejaculations, was not better than the utmost enjoyment of human 
society in the world ? 

I cannot say that, after this, for five years, any extraordinary thing 
happened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in the same pos- 
ture and place, as before ; the chief things I was employed in, be- 
sides my yearly labor of planting my barlej'^ and rice, and curing my 
raisins, of both which I always kept up just enough to have sufficient 
stock of one year's provision beforehana ; I say, Tbesides this yearly 
labor, and my daily pursuit of going out with my gun, I had one 
labor, to make a canoe, which at last I finished : so that, by digging 
a canal to it of six feet wide and four feet deep I brought it into the 
creek, almost half a mile. As for the first, which was so vastly big, 
for I made it without considering beforehnnd, as I ought to do, how 
I should be able to launch it, so, never being able to bring it into the 
water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it 
was, as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser the next time : in- 
deed, the next time, though I could not get a tree proper for it, and 
was in a place where I could not get the water to it at any less dis- 
tance than, as I have said, near half a mile, yet, as I saw it was prac- 
ticable at last, I never gave it over ; acd though I was near two 
years about it, yet I never grudged my labor, in hopes of having a 
boat to g;o off to sea at last. 

However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the «ize of 
it was not at all answerable to the design which I had in view when 
I made the first ; 1 mean of venturing over to the terra finna, where 
it was above forty miles broad ; accordingly, the smallness of my boat 
assisted to put an end to that design, and now I thought no more of 
it. As I had a boat, my next design was to mako-a cruise round the 
island ; for as 1 had been on the oiher side in one place", crossine:, as 
I have already? described it, over the land, so the discoveries I made in 
that httle journey made me very eager to see other parts of the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 95 

coast ; and now 1 had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round 
the island. ^ 

For this purpose, that I might do everything, with discretion and 
consideration, 1 fitted up a little mast in my boat, and made a sail too 
oat of some of the pieces of the ship's sails which lay in store, and of 
which I had a great stock by me. Having fitted my mast and sail, 
and tried the boat, I found she would sail very well : then I made 
little lockers, or boxes, at each end of my boat, to put provisions, 
necessaries, ammunition, etc., into, to be kept dry, either from rain 
or the spray of the sea ; and a little, long, hollow place 1 cut in the 
inside of the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang 
down over it to keep it dry. 

■ I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a mast, to 
stand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an 
awning ; and thus I every now and then took a little voyage upon 
the sea, but never went far out, nor far from the little creek. At 
last, being eager to view the circumference of my little kingdom, I 
resolved upon my cruise ; and accordingly 1 victualled my ship for 
the voyage, putting in two dozen of loaves (cakes I should rather 
call them) of barley-bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice (a food 
I ate a great deal of), a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder 
and shot for killing more, and two large watch- coats, of those which, 
as I mentioned before, I had saved out of the seamen's chests : these 
I took, one to lie upon and the other to cover me in the night. 

It was the 6th of November, in th6 sixth year of my reign, or my 
captivity, which you please, that I set out on this voyage, and I found 
it much longer than I expected ; for though the island itself was not 
very large, yet when I came to the east side of it I found a great 
ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea, some above 
water, some under it ; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry 
half a league more, so that I was obliged to go a great way out to soa 
to double the point. 

When first I discovered them, I was going to give over my en- 
terprise, and come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige 
me to go out to sea ; and, above all. doubting how I should get back 
again : so I came to an anchor ; for I had made a kind of an anchor 
with a piece of a broken grappling which I got out of the ship. 

Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore, climb- 
iog up a hill, which seemed to overlook that point, where I saw the 
full extent of it, and resolved to venture. 

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I perceived a 
strong, and, indeed, a most furious current, which ran to the east 
and even came close to the point ; and I took the more notice of it, 
because I saw there might be some danger, that when I came into it, 
I might be carried out to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to 
make the island again ; and, indeed, had i not got first upon this hill, 
I believe it would have been so ; for there was the same current on 



•->

% ROBINSON CBUSOE, 

the other side of the island, only that it set off at a farther distance, 
and I saw there was a strong eady under the shore ; so I had nothing 
to do but to get out of the lirst current, and 1 should presently be in 
an eddy. 

I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing pretty 
fresh at E.S.E., and that being just contrary to the current, made a 
great breach of the sea upon the point ; so that it was not safe for 
me to keep too close to the shore for the breach, nor to go too far 
off, because of the stream. 

The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated overnight, 
the sea was calm, and I ventured : but I am a warning to all rasdi 
and ignorant pilots ; for no sooner was I come to the point, when I 
was not even my boat's length from the shore, but I found myself in* 
a great depth of water, and a current like the sluice of a mill : it car- 
ried my boat along with it with such violence that all I could do 
could not keep her so much as on the edge of it ; but I found it hur- 
ried me farther and farther out from the eddy, which was on my left 
hand. There was no wind stin*ing to help me, and all I could do 
with my paddles signified nothing : and now 1 began to give myself 
over for lost ; for as the current was on both sides of the island, I 
knew in a few leagues' distance they must join again, and then I was 
irrecoverably gone ; nor did I sec any possibility of avoiding it ; so 
that I had no prospect before me but of perishmg, not by the sea, 
for that was calm enough, but of starving from hunger. I had, in- 
deed, found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as 1 could lift^ and 
had tossed it into the boat ; and I had a great jar of fresh water, 
that is to say, one of my earthen pots ; but what was all this to being 
driren into the vast ocean, where, to be sure, there was no shore, no 
main land or island, for a thousand leagues at least ? 

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of Qod to make 
even-the most miserable condition of mankind worse. Now I looked 
back upon my desolate, solitary island as the most pleasant place in 
the world, and all the happiness my heart could wish for was to be 
but there again. I stretched out my hands to it With eager wishes : 
*' Ob, happy desert I" said I, " I shall never see thee more. Oh, 
miserable creature ! whither am I ^oing?" Then I reproached my^ 
self with my unthankful temper, and that I had repined at my sofl- 
tary condition ; and now what would I give to be on shore ther^ 
again ! Thus, we never see the true state of our condition till it ia 
illustrated to us by its contraries, nor know how to value what w# 
enjoy but by the want of it. It is scarcely possible to imagine the 
consternation I was now in, Iwing driven from my beloved island ffor 
&o it apx^eared to me now to be) into the wide ocean, almost two 
leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever recovering it again. Ho^ 
ever, I worked hard till indeed my strength was almost exhausted, 
and kept my boat as much to the northward, that is, toward the side 
of the current which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could ; when

KOBINSOK CRUSOE. 97 

about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt a liltlo 
breeze of wind in my face, springing up from S.8.E. This cheered 
my heart a Utile, ana especially when, in about half an hour more, it 
blew a pretty gentle gale. By this time I liad got at a frightful dis- 
tance from the island, and had the least cloudy or hazy weather in- 
tervened, I had been undone another way, too ; for I had no com- 
pass on board, and should never have known how to have steered 
toward the island, if I had but once lost sight' of it ; but the weather 
contiDuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast again, and 
spread my sail, standing away to the north as much as possible, to 
get out of the current. 

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to stretch 
away. I saw even by the cleainess of the water some alteration of 
the current was near ; for where the current was so strong the water 
was foul ; but perceiving the water clear, I found the current abate ; 
and presently I found to the east, at about half a mile, a breach of 
the sea upon some rocks ; these rocks I found caused the current to 
part again, and as tlie main stress of it ran away more southerly, 
leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the other returned by the re- 
pulse uf the rocks, and made a strong eddy, which ran back again to 
the north-west, with a very sharp stream. 

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them 
upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder 
them, or who have been in such extremities, may guess what my 
present surprise q| joy was, and how gladly I put my boat into the 
'stream of this eddy ; and the wind also freshening, how gladly I 
spread my sail to it, running cheerfully before the wind, and with a 
strong tide or eddy under foot. 

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back again, di- 
rectly toward the island, but about two leagues more to the north- 
ward than the current which carried me a^yay at first ; so that when 
I came near the island, I found myself open to the northern ehore of 
it— that is to say, the other end of the islaind, opposite to that which 
I went out from. 

"When I had made something more than a league of way by the 
help of this current or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no 
farther. However, I found that being between two great currents, 
viz., that on the south side, which had hurried me away, and that on 
the north, which lay about a league on the other side ; 1 say, between 
these two, in the wake of the island, I found the water at least still, 
and running no way ; and having still a breeze of wind fair for me, 
I kept on steering directly for the island, though not making such 
fresh way as I did before. 

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within a league of 
the island, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned tins dis- 
aster, stretching out, as is described before, to the southward, and cast- 
ing off the current more southerly, had, of course, made another 
K.C. 



t 
98 ROBINSOX CRUSOE. 

eddy to the north ; and this I found very strong, but not directly 
setting the way my course lay,. which was due west, but almost full 
north. However, having a fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy, 
slanting north-west ; and in about an hour came within about a mile 
of the shore, where, it being smooth water, I soon got to land. 

When I was on shore, I fell on my kuees, and gave God thanks 
for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliver- 
ance by my boat ; and refreshing myself with such things as I had, 
I brought my boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied 
under some trees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with 
the labor and fatigue of the voyage. 

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat 1 
I had run so much hazard, and knew too much of the case, to think 
of attempting it by the way I went out ; and what might be at the 
other side (I mean the west side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to 
run any more ventures : so I resolved on the next morning to make 
my way westward along the shore, and to see if there was no creek 
where 1 might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again if 
I wanted her. In about three miles, or thereabout, coasting the 
shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay, about a mile over, which 
narrowed till it came to a vorv little rivulet or brook, where I found 
a very convenient harbor for my boat, and where she lay as if she 
had been in a little dock made on purpcse fcr her. Here I put in, and 
having slowed my boat very safe, I "wient on shore to look about me 
and see where I was. • 

I soon found I hnd but a little passed by the place where I had been * 
before, when I travelled on foot to Ihat she re ; so taking nothing out 
of my boat but my gun and umbrelh, for it was exceedingly hot, I 
began my march. The way was comfortable enough after such a 
voyage as I had been upon, and I reached my old bower in the even- 
ing, where I found everything standing as I left it ; for I always 
kept it in good order, being, as I said before, my country-house. 

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest my 
limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep ; but judge you, if you 
can, that read my story, what a surprise I must be in when I was 
awakened out of my sleep by a voice, calling me by my name sev- 
eral times, ** Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe : poor Robin Crusoe ! 
"Where are you, Robin Crusoe ? Where are you ? Where have you 
been?" 

, I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or pad- 
dling as it is called, the lirst part of the dav, and with walking the 
latter part, that I did not wake thoroughly ; but dozing between 
sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to 
me ; but as the voice continued to repeat, " Robin Crusoe, Robin 
Crusoe," at last I began to wake more perfectly, and was at first 
dreadfully frightened, and started up in the utmost consternation ; 
but no sooner were my eyes open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the 



'^1 



KOBINSOK CRUSOE. 99 

top of the hedge ; and immediately knew that it "waa he that spoke 
to me ; for just in such bemoaning language I had used to talk to 
him, and teach him ; and he had learned it so perfectly that he would 
sit upon my linger, and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, ** Poor 
Kobin Crusoe I Where are you ? Where have you been ? How 
came you here ?" and such things as I had taught him. 

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that indeed 
it could be nobodv else, it was a good while before I could compose 
myself. First, 1 was amazed how the creature got thither ; and 
then, how he should just keep about the place, and nowhere else ; 
but as I was well satisfied it could be nobodv but honest Poll, I got 
over it ;^ and holding out my hand, and calling Him by his name, 
** Poll, ''the sociable creature came to me, and sat upon my thumb, 
as he used to do, and continued talking to me, ** Poor Robin Crusoe ! 
and how did I come here ? and where had I been ?" just as if he had 
been overjoyed to see me again ; and so I carried him home along 
with me. ^ 

I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had 
enough to do, for many days, to sit still and reflect upon the danger I 
had been in. I would have been very glad to have had my boat again 
on my side of the island ; but I knew not how it was practicable to 
get it about. As to the east side of the island, which I had gone 
round, I knew well enough there was no venturing that way ; my 
very heart would shrink, and my ver^r blood run chill, but to think 
of it ; and as to the other side of the island, I did not know how it 
might be there ; but supposing the current ran with the same force 
against the shore at the east as it passed by it on the other, I might 
run the same risk of being driven down the stream and carried by 
the island as I had been before of being carried away from it : so 
with these thoughts, I contented myself to be without any boat, 
though it had been the product of so many months' labor to make 
it, and of so many more to get it into the sea. 

In this government of my temper, I remained near a year ; and 
lived a very sedate, retired Ufe, as you may well suppose ; and my 
thoughts being very much composed, as to my condition, and fully 
comforted in resigning myself to the dispositions of Providence, I 
thought I lived really very happily in all things, except that of society. 

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises which 
my necessities put me upon applying myself to ; and I believe I 
should, upon occasion, have made a very good carpenter, especially 
considering how few tools I had. 

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthen- 
ware, and contrived well enough to make them with a wheel, which 
I found infinitely easier and better ; because I made things round 
and shaped, which before were filthy things indeed to look on. But 
I think J. was bev^r more vain of my own performance, or more joy- 
ful for anything I found out, than for my being able to make a to- 



100 ROBINSOIT CRUSOE. 

bacco-pipe ; and though it was a very ugly, clumsy thing when it 
was done, and only burned red, like other earthenware, yet as it was 
hard and firm, and would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly com- 
forted with it, for I had been always used to smoke ; and there were 
pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not thinking that there 
' was tobacco in the island ; and afterward, when I searched the 
ship again, I could not come at any pipes. 

In my wickerware, also, I improved much, and made abundance 
of necessary baskets, as well as my invention showed me ; though not 
very handsoijie, yet they were such as were very handy and conven- 
ient for laying things up in or fetching things home. For exam- 
ple, if I killed a goat abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, 
dress it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket :' and the 
like by a turtle : I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or 
two of the flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them home in 
a basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also, large deep baskets 
were the receiyers t)f my corn, which I always rubbed out as soon as 
it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great baskets. 

I began now to perceive my powder abate considerably ; this was 
a want which it was impossible for me to supply, and I began seri- 
ously to consider what I must do when I should have no more pow- 
der ; that is to say, how I should kill any goats. I had, as is ob- 
served, in the third year of my being here, kept a young kid, and 
bred her up tame, and I was in hopes of ^getting a' he-goat : but I 
could not by any means bring it to pass, till my kid grew an old 
goat ; and as I could never find in my heart to kill her, she died at 
last of mere age. 

But being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I ha,ve 
said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to 
trap and snare the goats, to see whether I could not catch some of 
them alive ; and particularly, I wanted a she-goat great with young. 
For this purpose I made snares to hamper them ; and I do believe 
they were more than once taken in them ; but my tackle was 
not good, for I had no wire, and I always found them broken, 
and my bait devoured. At length 1 resolved to try a pitfall : so I 
dug several large pits in the earth, in places where I had observed 
the goats used to feed, and over those pits I placed hurdles, of my 
own making too, with a great weight upon the9i ; and several times 
I put ears of barley and dry rice, without setting the trap ; and I 
could easily perceive that the goats had gone in and eaten up the 
corn, for I could see the marks of their feet. At length, I set three 
traps in one night, and going the next morning I found them all 
standing, and yet the baif eaten and gone : this was very discourag- 
ing. However, I altered my traps ; and, not to trouble you witli 
particulars, goin^ one morning to see my traps, I found in one of 
them a large old he-goat ; and in one of the others, three kids, a 
male and two females. 



».' 



ROBINSOX CEUSOE. * 101 

As to tbc old one, I knew not what to do with him ; he was so 
fierce I durst not go into the pit to him ; that is to say, to bring him 
away alive, which was what I wanted. I could have killed him, but 
that was not my business, nor would it answer my end ; so I even let 
him out, and he ran away as if he had been frightened out of his wits. 
But I did not then know wliat I afterward learned, that hunger will 
tame a lion. If I had let him stay there three or four days without 
food, and then have carried him some water to drink, and then a 
little corn, he would have been as tame as one of the kids ; for they 
are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they are well used. 

However, for the present, 1 let him go, knowing no better at that 
time : then I went to the three kids, and, taking them one by one, I 
tied them with strings together, and with some difliculty brought 
them all Jiome. 

It was a good while before they would feed ; but throwing them 
some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to be tame. And 
now I found that if I expected to supply myself with goats' flesh, 
when I had no powder or shot left, brecaing some up tame was my 
only way, when, perhaps, I might have them about my house like a 
flock of sheep. But then it occurred to me that I must keep the 
tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild when they 
grew up ; and the only way for this was to base some inclosed piece 
of ground, wetl fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep them in so 
effectually that those within might not break out, or those without 
break in. 

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands ; yet, as I saw 
there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first work was to 
find out a proper piece of ground, where there was likely to be herb- 
age for them to eat, water for them to drink, and cover to keep them 
from the sun. 

Those who understand such inclosures will think I had very little 
contrivance when I pitched upon a place very proper for all these (be- 
ing a plain open piece of meatiow land, or savanna, as our people 
call it in the western colonies), which had two or three little drills of 
fresh water in it; and at one end was very woody — I say, they will 
smile at my forecast when I shall tell them I began by inclosing this 
piece of ground in such a manner that my hedge or pale must have 
been at least two miles about. Nof was the madness of it so great as 
to the compass, for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time 
enough to do it in ; but I did not consider that my goats would be as 
wild m so much compass as if they had had the whole island, and I 
should have so much room to chase them in that I should never catch 
them. 

My hedge was -begim and carried on, I believe, about fifty yards 
when this thought occurred to me ; so I presently stopped short, 
and, for the beginniDg, I resolved to inclose a piece of about one 
hundred and fifty yards in length and one hundred yards in breadth, 



^_^V... 



102 • EOBINSON CRUSOE. 

which, as it would maintain aa many as I should have in any reason- 
able time, so, as my stock increased, I could add more ground to my 
inclosure. 

This was acting with some prudence,' and 1 went to work with 
courage. I was about three months hedging in the first piece ; and, 
till I had done it, 1 tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and 
used them to feed as near me as possible, to make them familiar ; 
and very often I would go and carry them some ears of barley, or a 
handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand ; so that, alter my 
inclosure was finished, and I let them loose, they would follow me 
up and down, bleating after me for a handful of corn. 

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had a flock 
of about twelve goats, kids and all ; and in two years more I had three- 
and-forty, besides several that I took and killed for my food. After 
that I inclosed five several pieces of ground to feed them in, with 
little pens to drive them into, to take them as I wanted, and gates out 
of one piece of ground into another. 

But this was not all ; for now I not only had goats' flesh to feed 
on when I pleased, but milk too— a thing which, indeed, in the be- 
ginning, I did not so miich as think of, and which, when it came into 
my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise, for now I set up my 
dairy, and had sometynes a gallon or two of milk in a day. And as 
Nature, who gives supplies of food to every creature, dictates even 
naturally how to make use of it, so I, that had never milked a cow, 
much less a goat, or seen butter or cheese made only when I was a 
boy, after a great many essays and miscarriages, made both butter 
and cheese at last, also, salt (though I found it partly made to my 
hand by the heat of the sun upon some of the rocks of the sea), and 
never wanted it afterward. How mercifully can our Creator treat 
his creatures, even in those conditions in which they seem to be 
overwhelmed in destruction ! How can he sweeten the bitterest 
providences, and give us cause to praise him for dungeons and pris- 
ons I What a taWe was here spread for me in the wilderness, where 
I saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger ! 

It would have made a Stoic smile to have seen me and my little 
family sit down to dinner. There was my majesty, the prince and lord 
of the whole island ; I had the lives of all my subjects at my abso- 
lute command ; I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away, 
and no rebels among all my subjects. Then, to see how like a king 
I dined, too, all alone, attended by my servants ! Poll, as if he had 
been my favorite, was the only person permitted to talk to me. My 
dog, who was now grown very old and crazy, and had found no spe- 
cies to multiply his kind upon, sat always at my right hand ; and 
two cats, one on one side of the table and one on the other, expecting 
now and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of especial lavor. 

But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at first, 
for they were both of them dead^ and had been interred near my 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 103 

habitation by my own hand ; but one of them having multiplied by I 
know not what kind of creature, these were two which I had pre- 
served tame ; whereas the rest run wild in the woods, and became 
indeed troublesome to me at last, for they would often come into my 
house, and plunder me, too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, 
and did kill a great many ; at length they left me. With this attend- 
ance and in this plentiful manner I lived ; neither could I be said to 
want anything biit society ; and of that, some time after this, I was 
likely to have much. 

I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use of 
my boat, though very loath to run any more hazards ; and therefore 
sometimes^I sat contriving ways to get her about the island, and at 
other times I sat myself down contented enough without her. But I 
had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the 
island, where, as I have said, in my last ramble, I went up the hill to 
8ee how the shore lay, and how the current set, that I might see 
what I had" to do : this inclination increased upon me every da3% and 
at length I resolved to travel thither by land, following the edge of 
the shore. I did so ; but had any oue in England met such a man as 
I was, it must either have frightened him or raised a great deal of 
laughter ; and as I frequently stood still to look at myself, I could 
not but smile at the notion of my travelling through Yorkshire with 
such an equipage and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch 
of my figure, as follows : 

I had a great, high, shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, with a 
flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to 
shoot the rain off from running ilito my necK, nothing being so hurt- 
ful in these climates as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes. 

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming down to about 
the middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the 
same ; the breeches were made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose 
hair hung down such a length on either side that, like pantaloons, it 
reached to the middle of my legs ; stockings and shoes I had none, 
but had made me a pair of somethings, I scarce know what to call 
them, like buskins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like 
spatterdashes, but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the 
rest of my clothes. 

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew together 
with two thongs of the same instead of buckles, and in a kind of a 
frog on either side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a 
little saw and a hatchet, one on one side and one on the other." I 
had another belt not so broad, and fastened in the same manner, 
which hung over my shoulder, and at the end of it, under my left 
arm, hung two pouches, both made of goat's skin too, in one of 
which hung my powder, in the other my shot. At my back I car- 
ried my basket, and on my shoulder my gun, and over my head a 
great clumsy, ugly, goat's-skin umbrella, but which, after all, was 






104 ROBFNSON CRUSOE. 

the most necessaiy thing I had about me next to my gun. As for 
my face, the color of it was really not so mulatto-like as one might 
expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living within liine or 
ten degrees of the equinox. M}^ beard I had once suffered to grow till 
it was about a quarter of a yard long ; but as I had both scissors and 
razors su^cient, I had cut it pretty short except what grow on my 
upper lip, which 1 had trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan 
whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks at Sallee, for the 
Moofs did not wear such, though the Turks did ; of these mus- 
taches or whiskers I will not say they were long enough to hang 
my hat upon them, but they were of a length and shape monstrous 
enough, and such as in Englsmd would have passed for frightful. 

But all this is by the bye ; for, as to my figure, I had so few to ob- 
serve me that it was of no manner of consequence, so I say no more 
of that. In this kind of dress I went my new journey, and was out 
five or six days. I travelled first along the sea-shore, directly to the 
plaoe where I first brought my boat to an anchor to get upon the 
rocks ; and having no boat now to take care of, I went over the land 
^ nearer way to the sam^ height that I was upon before, when, look- 
ing forward to the points of the rocks which lay out, and which I 
was obliged to double with my boat, as is said above, I was sur- 
prised to see the sea all smooth and quiet — no rippling, no motion, na 
current, any more there than in any other places. I was at a strange 
loss to understand this, and resolved to spend some time in the ob- 
serving it, to see if nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned 
it ; but I was presently convinced how it was, viz., that the tide of 
ebb setting from the west, and joining with the current of waters 
from some great river on the shore, must be the occasion of this cur- 
rent, and that, according as the wind blew naore forcibly from the 
west or from the north, this current came nearer, or went farther 
from the shore ; for, waiting thereabout till evening, I went up to 
the rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw 
the current s^in as before, only that it ran farther off, being near 
half a league from the shore, whereas in my case it set close upon 
the shore, and hurried me and my canoe along with it, which at an- 
other time it would not have done. 

This observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but to ob- 
serve the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might very easily 
bidng my boat about the island again ; but when I began to think of 
putting it in practice, I had such terror upon my spirits at the re- 
membrance of the danger I had been in, that I could not think of it 
a;?ain with any patience, but, on the contrary, I took up another 
resolution, which was more safe, though more laborious — and this 
was, that I would build, or rather make, me another peria^a or 
canoe, and so have one for one side of the island, and one lor the 
other. 

You are to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two plan- 



'>.^?. .v_-.

titiona in the island— one my little fortification or tent, with the 
wall about it, under the rock, with the cave behind me, which by 
this tiijie 1 had enlarged into several apartments, or caves, one within 
another. One of these, which was the driest and largest, and had 
a door out beyond my wall or fortification — that is to say, beyond 
where my wall joined to the rock — ^was all filled up with the large 
earthen pots, of which I have given an account, and with fourteen 
or fifteen great baskets, which would hold five or six bushels each, 
where I laid up my stores of provisions, especially my com, some in 
the ear, cut qM short from the straw, and the other rubbed out with 
my hand. 

As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles, those 
piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so big and 
spread so very much that there was not the least appearance, to any 
one's view, of any habitation behind them. 

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land, and 
upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn-land, which I kept 
duly cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest 
in its season ; and whenever I had occasion for more com, I had 
more land adjoining as fit as that. 

Besides this, I had my country-seat, and I had now a tolerable 
plantation there also ; for, first, I had my little bower, as I called it, 
which I kept in repair — that is to say, I kept the hedge, which encircled 
it in, constantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder standing 
always in the inside. I kept the trees, which at fi rst were no more tlian 
stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall, always cut, so that 
they might spread and grow thick and Wild, and make the more 
agreeable shade, which they did effectually to my mind. In the 
middle of this I had my tent always ststnding, being a piece of a sail 
spread over poles, set up for that purpose, and which never wanted 
any repair or renewing ; and under this I had made me a squab or 
couch, with the skins of the CKJatures I had killed, and with other 
soft things, and a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea 
bedding, which I had saved ; and a great watch-coat to cover me. 
And here, whenever*! had occasion to be absent from my chief seat, 
I took up my country habitation. 

Adjoining to this I had my inclosures for my cattle — that is to say, 
my goats ; and I had ts^en an inconceivable deal of pains to fence 
and inclose thi^ ground. I was so anxious to see it kept entire, lest 
the goats should break through, that I never left off till, with infinite 
labor, I had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes, 
and so near to one another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, 
and there was scarce room to put a hand through between them ; 
which afterward, when those stakes grew, as they all did in the 
next rainy season, made the inclosure strong like a wall, indeed 
stronger than anv wall. 

T1& will testify fw Boe that I was not idle, axul that I spared no

106 EOBINSON CRUSOB, 

pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessar}' for my comfort- 
able support, for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame creat- 
ures thus at my hand would be a living magazine of flesh, milk, 
butter, and -cheese for me as long, as I lived in the place, if it were to 
be forty years ; and that keeping them in my reach depended 
entirely upon my perfecting my inclosures to such a degree that I 
might be sure of keeping them together ; which, by this method, in- 
deed, I so effectually secured that when these little stakes began to 
grow I had plantetl them so veiy thick that I was forced to pull 
some of them up again. 

In this place also I had my grapes growing, whiqh I principally 
depended on for my winter store of raisins, and which I never failed 
to preserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of 
my whole diet • and indeed they were not only agreeable but medici- 
nal, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last degree. 

As tliis was also about half way between my other habitation and the 
place where I had laid up my boat, I generally staid and lay here in 
my way thither, for I used frequently to visit my boat ; and I kept 
all things about, or belonging to her, in very good order. Some- 
times I went out in her to divert myself, but no more hazardous voy- 
ages would I go, scarcely ever above a stone's cast or two from the 
shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge 
again by the currents or winds, or any other accident. But now I 
come to a new scene of my life. 

It happened one day, about noon, going toward my boat, I was 
exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot on the 
shore, which was very plain to be seen on the sand. I stood like 
one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an ap1!>arition. I listened, I 
looked round me, but I could* hear nothing nor see anything ; I went 
up to a rising ground, to look farther ; I went up the shore and down 
tlie shore, but it was all one : I could see no other impression but 
that one. I went to it again to see if there were any more, and to 
observe if it might not be my fancy ; but there was no room for that, 
for there was exactly the print of a foot — toes, heel, and every part of 
a foot. How it«came thither I knew not, nor could I in the least 
imagine ; but after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man per- 
fectly confused and out of myself, I came home to my fortification, 
not feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but terrified to the last 
degree, looking behmd me at every two or three steps, mistaking 
every bush and tree, and fancying every stump at a distance to be a 
man. Nor is it possible to describe how many various shapes my 
affrighted imagination represented things to me in, how many wild 
ideas were found every moment in my fancy, and what strange, un- 
accountable whimseys came into my thoughts by the way. 

When I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever after 
this), I fled into it like one pursued. Whether I went over by the lad- 
der, as first contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I had 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 107 

called a dopr, I cannot remember ; no, nor could I remember the 
next morning, for never frightened hare fled to cover, or fox to 
earth, with more terror of mind than I to this retreat. 

I slept none that night ; the farther I was from the occasion of 
my fright the greater my apprehensions were, which is something 
contrary to the nature of such things, and especially to the usual 
practice of all creatures in fear ; but 1 was so embarrassed with mv 
own frightful ideas of the thing that I formed nothing but dismal 
imaginations to myself, even though I was now a gieatwaynff. 
Sometimes I fancied it must be the devW^ and reason joined in with 
me in this supposition, for how should any other thing in human 
shape come into the place? Where was the vessel that brought them ? 
What marks were there of any other footstep ? And how was it 
possible a man should come there ? But then, to think that Satan 
should take human shape upon him in such a place, where there 
could be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of bis 
foot behind him, and that even for no purpose too, for he could not 
be sure I should see it — this was an amazement the other way. I 
considered that the devil might have found out abundance of other 
ways to have terrified me than this of the single print of a foot ; that 
as 1 lived quite on the other side of the island, he would never have 
been so simple as to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thou- 
sand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in the sand too 
which the first surge of the sea, upon a high wind, would have de- 
faced entirely. All this seemed inconsistent with the thing itself, 
and with all the notions we usually entertain of the subtlety of the 
devil. 

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of all 
apprehensions of its being the devil ; and I presently concluded then 
that it must be some more dangerous creature, viz., that it must be 
some of the savages of the mainland opposite, who had wandered 
out to sea in their canoes, and either driven by the currents or by 
contrary winds, had made the island, and had been on shore, but 
were gone away again to sea ; being as loath, p( rliaps, to have staid 
in this desolate island as I would have been to have had them. 

While these reflections were rolling in my mind, I was very thank- 
ful in nay thoughts that I was so happy as not to be thereabout at 
that lime, or that ^ they did not see my boat, by which they would 
have concluded that some inhabitants had been in the place, and per- 
haps have searched farther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked 
my imagination about their having found out my boat, and that 
there were people here ; and that, if so, I should certainly have them 
come again in greater numbers, and devour me ; that if it should hap- 
pen that they should not find me, yet they would find my inclosure, 
destroy all my corn, and carry away all my flock of tame goats, and 
I should perish at last- for mere want. 

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that former con- 



108 BOBINSON CRUSOE. 

fidence in God, which was founded upon such wonderful experience 
^s I had had of his goodness ; as if he that had fed me by miracle 
hitherto could not preserve, by his power, the provision which he 
had made for me by his goodness. I reproached myself with my 
laziness, Uiat would not sow any more corn one year than would 
just serve me till the next season, as if no accident could intervene 
to prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground ; and 
this I thought so just a reproof that I resolved for the future to have 
two or three years* corn beforehand ; so that, whatever might come 
I might not perish for want of bread. 

How strange a checker- work of Providence is the life of man ! and 
by wliat secret different spriuga are the affections hurried about, as 
different circumstances present I To-day we love what to-morrow 
we hate ; to-day we seek what to-morrow we shun ; to-day we 
desire what to-morrow we fear, nay, even tremble at the ap- 
prehensions of. This was exemplified in me, at this time, in 
the most livehr manner imsginable, for I, whose only afflic- 
tion was that I seemed banished from human society, that 1 was 
alone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut off from mankind, 
and condemned to what I called silent life ; that 1 was one whom 
heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the living, or to 
appear among the rest of his creatures ; that to have seen one of my 
own species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to 
life, and the greatest blessing that heaven itself, next to the supreme 
blessing of salvation, could bestow. I say that I should now trem- 
ble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to sink 
into the ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man hav- 
ing set his foot in the island. 

Such is the uneven st^te of human life ; and it afforded me a great 
many curious speculations afterward, when I had a little recov- 
ered my first surprise. I considered that this was the station of life 
the infinitely wise and good providence of God had determined for 
me ; that as I could not foresee what the ends of divine wisdom 
might be in all this, so I was not to dispute his sovereignty ; who, as 
I was his creature, had an undoubted right, by creation, to govern and 
dispose of me absolutely as he thought fit ; and who, as I was a creat- 
ure that had offended him, had likewise a judicial right to condemn 
mn to what punishment he thought fit ; and that it was my part to 
submit to bear bis indignation, because I had sinned against him. I 
then reflected that as God, who was not only righteous but omnipo- 
tent, had thought fit thus to punish and aflflict ^e, so he was ablelo 
deliver me ; that if he did not think fit to do so, it was my unques- 
tioned duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely to his will ; and, 
on the other hand, it was my duty also to hope in him, pra}"^ to him, 
and quietly to attend the dictates and directions of his daily provi- 
dence. 

Thes^ th9U£hits too)L me up many hqi^, days> miy, I may ^ay 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 109 

weeks and months ; and one particular effect of my cogitations on 
this occasion I cannot omit. One morning early, lying in my bed, 
and filled with thoughts about my danger from the appearances of 
savages, I found it discomposed me very much ; upon which these 
words of the Scripture came into my thoughts : *' Call upon me in 
the day of trouble, and 1 will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify 
me.** Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was not 
only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to pray earnestly 
to God for deliverance : when I had done praying, I took up my 
Bible, and opening it to read, the first words that presented to me 
were, '* Wait on the Lord and be of good cheer, and he shall 
strengthen thy heart ; wait, I say, on the Lord." It is impossible to 
express the comfort this gave me. In answer, I thankfully laid 
down the book, and was no more sad, at least on that occasion. 

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflections, 
it came into my thoughts one day that all this mi^ht be a mere 
chimera of my own, and that this foot might be the print of my own 
foot, when I came on shore from my boat : this cheered me up a lit- 
tle, too, and I began to persuade myself it was all a delusion ; that it 
was nothing else but my own foot ; and why might I not come that 
way from the boat, as well as I was going that way to the boat ? 
Again I considered also, that I could by no means tell, for certain, 
where I had trod and where I had not ; and that if, at lost, this 
was only the print of my own foot, I had played the part of those 
fools who try to make stories of spectres and apparitions, and then 
are frightened at them more than anybody. 

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for I had 
not stirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so that I be^an 
to starve for provisions ; for I had little or nothing within doors but 
some barley-cakes and water ; then I knew that my goats wanted to 
be milked too,which usually was my ev^ening diversion ; and the poor 
creatures were in great pain and inconvenience for want of it ; and, 
indeed, it almost spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their 
mUk. Encouraging myself, therefore, with the belief that this was 
nothing but the print of one of my own feet, and that I might 
be truly said to start at my own shadow, I began to go abroad 
again, and went to my country-house to milk my flock : but to 
see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked behind 
me, how I was ready, every now and then, to lay down my 
basket and run for mv life, it would have made any one have 
thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had 
been lately most terribly frightened ; and so, indeed, I had. How- 
ever, I went down thus two or three days, and having seen nothing, 
I began to be a little bolder, and to think there was really nothing in 
it but my own imagination ; but I could not persuade myself lully of 
this till I should go down to the shore again and see this print of a 
foot, and measure it by my own, and see if there was any similitude 



110 ROBINSON" CRUSOE. 

or fitness, that I might be assured it was my own foot : tjut when I 
came to the place — ^first, it appeared evidently to me that when I 
laid up my boat I could not possibly be on shore anywhere there- 
about ; secondly, when I came to measure the mark with my own 
foot, I found my foot not so large by a great deal. Both these things 
filled my head with new imaginations, and gave me the vapurs again 
to the highest degree, so tliat I shook with cold like one in an ague ; 
and I went home again, filled with the belief that some man or men 
had been on shore there ; or, in short, that the island was inhabited, 
and I might be surprised before I was aware ; and what course to 
take for my seciu*ity I knew not. 

O wbat ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with fear I 
It deprives them of the use of those means which reason offers for 
their relief. The first thing I proposed to myself was to throw down 
my inclosures and turn all my tame cattle wild into the wolkIs, lest 
the enemy should find them, and then frequent the island in prospect 
of the same or the like booty ; then the simple thing of digging up 
my two corn-fields, lest they should find such a grain there, and still 
be prompted to frequent the island ; then to demolish my bower and 
tent, that they might not see any vestiges of habitation, and be 
prompted to look farther, in order to find out the persons inhabiting. 

These were the subject of the first night's cogitations after I was 
come home again, while the apprehensions which had so overrun my 
mind were fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapors. Thus, 
fear of danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger it- 
self, when apparent to the eyes ; and we find the burden of anxiety 
greater, by much, than the evil which we are anxious about ; and 
what was worse than all this, I had not that relief in this trouble that, 
from the resignation I used to practise, I hoped to have. I looked, I 
thought, like Saul, who complained not only that the Philistines were 
upon him, but that God had forsaken him ; for I did not now take 
due ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in my distress, and 
resting upon his providence, as I had done before, for my defence 
and deliverance ; which if I had done, I had at least been more 
cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and perhaps carried 
through it with more resolution. 

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night ; but in 
the morning I fell asleep ; and having, by the amusement of my 
mind, been, as it were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very 
soundly, and waked much better composed than I had ever been be- 
fore. And now I began to think sedately ; and, upon debate with 
myself, I concluded that this island (which was so exceedingly pleas- 
ant, fruitful, and no farther from the mainland than as I had seen) 
was not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine ; that although 
there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet tliat there 
might sometimes come boats off from the shore, who, either with de- 
sign, or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross winds, 



ROBIKSOK CRUSOE. Ill 

might come to this ^lace ; that I had lived here fifteen years now, 
and had not met with the least shadow or figure of any people yet ; 
and that, if at any time they should be driven here, it was probable 
they went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had 
never thought fit to fix here upon any occasion ; that the most I 
could suggest any danger from was, from any casual accidental land- 
ing of straggling people from the main, who, as it was* likely, if they 
were driven hither, were here against their wills, so they made no 
stay here, but went off again with all possible speed ; seldom stay- 
ing one night on shore, lest Ihey should not have the help of the tides 
and dayliglit back again ; and that therefore I had nothing to do 
but to consider of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages 
land upon the spot. 

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as 
to bring a door through again, which door, as I said, came out be- 
yond where my fortification joined to the rock : upon maturely con- 
sidering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second fortification, 
in the same manner of a semicircle, at a distance from my wall, just 
where I.had planted a double row of trees about twelve years before, 
of whicl^ I made mention : these trees having been planted so thick 
before, they wanted but few piles to be driven between them, that 
they might be thicker and stronger, and my wall would \ye soon fin- 
ished. So that I had now a double wall ; and my outer wall was thick- 
ened' with pieces of timbe , old cables, and everything I could tbink 
of, to make it strong ; having in it seven little holes, about as big as 
I might put my arm out at. In the inside of this I thickened my 
wall to about ten feet thick, with continually bringing earth out oi 
my cave and laying ik at the foot of the wall and walking upon it ; 
and through the seven holes I contrived to 'plant the muskets, of 
^hich I took notice that I had got seven on shore out of the ship ; 
these I planted like my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that 
held them like a carriage, so that I could fire all the seven guns in 
two minutes* time ; this wall I was many a wearv month in finish- 
ing, and yet never thought myself safe till it was done. 

When this was done I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a 
great length every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the osier-like 
wood, which 1 found so apt to grow, as they could well stand ; inso- 
much that I believe I might set in near twenty thousand of them, 
leaving a pretty large space between them and my wall, that 1 might 
have room to see an enemy, and they might have no shelter from the 
young trees, if they attempted to approach my outer wall. 

Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove ; and in five or six 
years* time I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so mon- 
strously thick and strong that it was indeed perfectly impassable ; 
and no men, of what kind soever, could ever imagine that there was 
anything beyond it, much less a habitation. As for the wajr which I 
proposed to myself to gp in an4 out (for I left no avenue), it was by 



s* 



113 BOBINSON CEUSOE. 

Belting two ladders, one to a part of the rock which "was low, and 
then broke in, and left room to place another ladder upon that ; so 
when the two ladders were taken down, no man living could come 
down to me without doing himself mischief ; and if they had come 
down they were still on the outside of my outer wall. 

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for 
my own preservation ; and it will be «een, at length, that they were 
not altogether without just reason ; though 1 foresaw nothing at that 
time more than my mere fear suggested to me. 

While this was doing, I was npt altogether careless of my other 
affairs ; for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of 
goats : they were not only a ready supply to me on every occasion, 
and began to be sufficient for mo, without the expense of powder and 
shot, but also without the fatigue of hunting after the wild ones ; and 
I was loath to lose the advantage of them, and to have them all to 
nurse up over again. 

For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but 
two ways to preserve them : one was, to find another convenient place 
10 dig a cave under ground, and to drive them into it every night ; 
and the other was to inclose two or three little bits of land, remote 
from one another, and as much concealed as I could^ where I might 
keep about half aulozen young goats in each place ; so that if any 
disaster happened to the flock in general, 1 might be able to raise 
them again with little trouble and time ; and this, though it would 
require a good deal of time and labor, I thought was the most 
rational design. 

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts 
of the island ; and I pitched upofi one, which was as private, indeed, 
as my heart could wish for : it was a little damp piece of ground, in 
the middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I 
almost lost myself once before, endeavoring to come back that way 
from the eastern part of the island. Here I found a clear piece of 
land, near three acres, so surrounded with woods that it was almost 
an inclosure by nature ; at least, it did not want near so much labor 
to make it so as the other piece of ground I had worlsed so hard at. 

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground ; and in less 
than a month's time I had so fenced it round that my flock, or herd, 
call it which you please, which were not so wild now as at first they 
might be supposed to be, were well enough secured in it : so, without 
any further delay, I removed ten young she-goats and two he-gouts 
to this piece ; and when they were there, I continued to perfect the 
fence till ^. had made it as secure as the other ; which, however, I 
did at more leisure, and it took me up more time by a great deal. 
All this labor I was at the expense of oiirely from ray apprehensions 
on the account of the print of a man's foot ; for, as yet, I had never 
seen any human creature come near the island ; and I had now lived 
two years under this uneasiness, which, indeed, made my life mai&

less comfortable than it was before, as may be well imagined by any 
who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the tear of man. 
And this I must observe, with grief, too,, that the discomposure of 
my mind had great impression also upon the religious part of my 
thoughts ; for the dread and terror of falling into the hands of savages 
and cannibals lay so upon my spirits that! seldom found myself in 
a due temper for application to my Maker ; at least, not witli the 
sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I was wont to do : I 
rather prayed to God as under great affliction and pressure of miud, 
surrounded with danger, and in expectation every night of being 
murdered and devoured before morning ; and I must testify, from 
my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness, love, and affec- 
tion, is much the more pn>per frame for prayer than that of terror 
and discomposure ; and that under the dread of mischief impending, 
a man is no more fit for a comforting performance of the duty of 
praying to God than he is for a repentance on a sick-bed ; for these 
discomposures affect the mind as the others do the body ; and the 
discomposure of the mind must necessarily be as great a disability as 
that of th^ body, and much greater ; praying to Gfod being properly 
an act of the miud, not of the body. 

But to go on : after I had thus secured one part of my little living 
stock, 1 went about the whole island searching for another private 
place to make such another deposit ; when, wandering more to the 
west point of the island than I had ever done yet, and looking out to 
sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea, ai a great distance. I had 
found a perspective glass or two in one of the seamen's chests, which 
I saved out of our ship, but I had it not about me ; and this was so 
remote that I could not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it 
till my eyes were not able to hold to look any longer : whether it 
was a boat or not I do not know, but as I descended from the hill I 
could see no more of it, so I gave it over ; only I resolved to go nd 
more out without a perspective glass in my pocket. When 1 was 
come down the hill to the end of the island, where, indeed, I had 
never been before, I was presently convinced that the seeing the print 
of a man's foot was not such a strange thing in the island as I imag- 
ined ; and but that it was a special providence that I was cast upon 
the side of the island where the savages never came, I should easily 
have known that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes 
from the main, when they happened to be a little too far out at sea, 
to shoot over to that side of the island for harbor ; likewise, as they 
often met and fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken any 
prisoners, would bring them over to this shore, where, according to 
their dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat 
them ; of which hereafter. 

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, beins 
the S.W. point of. the island, I was perfectly confounded ana 
amazed ; nor is it possible for me to express the horror of my mind 



\ 



114 ROBINSON- CRUSOE. 

at seeing the 8li(M*e spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other 
bones of liuman bodies ; and particulaily, I observed a place where 
there had been a fire made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a cock- 
pit, where 1 supposed the savage wretches had sat down to their 
inhuman feastings upon the bodies pf their fellow creatures. 

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I enter- 
tained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a long while : 
all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of 
inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of 
Imman nature, which, though I had heai-d of it often, yet I never 
had so near a view of before ; in shorl, I turned away my face from 
Uie horrid spectacle ; my stomach giew sick, and I was just at tlie 
point of fainting, when natuie discharged the disorder from my 
stomach ; and having vomited with uncommon violence, I was a 
little relieved, but could not bear to stay in the place a moment ; so 
I got up the hill again with all the speed I could, and walked on tow- 
ard my own habitalion. 

"When I came a little out of that part of the island, I stood still 
awhile, as amazed, and then, recovering myself, I looked up with the 
utmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, 
gave Gqd thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the world 
where I was distinguished from such dreadful creatures as these ; 
and that, though I had esteemed my present condition very miser- 
able, had yet given me so many comforts in it that I had still more 
to give thanks for than to complain of ; and this, above all, that I 
had, even in this miserable condition^ been comforted with the 
knowledge of himself, and the hope of his blessing : which was a 
felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which 1 
had suffered or could suffer. 

In this frame of thankfulness, 1 went home to my castle, and began 
to be much easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than 
ever I was before ; for I observed that these wretches never came to 
this island in search of what they could get ; perhaps not seeking, 
not wanting, or not expecting, anything hera; and having often, no 
doubt, been up the covered, woody part of it, witiiout finding any- 
thing to their purpose. I knew I had been here now almost eigh- 
teen years, and never saw the least footsteps of human creature 
there before ; and I might be eighteen years more as entirely con- 
cealed as I was now, if I did not discover myself to them, ^hich I 
had no manner of occasion to do ; it being my only business io keep 
myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I found a better sort 
of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to. Yet I ent^er- 
tained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I have beda 
speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman custom of their devouring 
and eating one another up, that I continued pensive and sad, and 
kept close within my own circle, for almost two years after this : 
when I say my own circle, I mean by it my three plantations^ viz.. 



ROBIN^SOK CRUSOE. 115 

my castle, my country-seat (which I called my bower), and my in- 
closure in the woods : nor did I look after this for any other use 
than as an Inclosure for my goats ; for the aversion which nature 
gave me to these hellish wretches was such that I was as fearful of 
seeing them as of seeing the devil himself. I did not so much as go 
to look after my boat all this time, but began rather to think of mak- 
ing another ; for I could not think of ever making any more attempts 
to bring the other boat round the island to me, lest I should meet 
with some of these creatures at sea ; in which case, if I had happened 
to have fallen into their hands, I knew what would have been my lot. 

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no dauger 
of being discovered by these people, began to wear off my uneasiness 
about them ; and I began to live just in the same composed manner 
as before, only with this difference, that I used more caution, and 
kept my eyes more about ine than I did before, lest I should happen 
to be seen by any of ihera ; and, particularly, I was more cautious of 
firing my gun, lest any of them, beinjsf on tlie island, should happen 
to hear it. It was, therefore, a very good providence to me that I 
had furnished myself wi^i a tame breed of goats, and that I had no 
need to hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them ; and if I 
did catch any of them after this, it was by traps and snares, as I had 
done before ; so that for two years after this, 1 believe I nearer fired 
my gun opce off, thouglk I never went out without it ; and, wliat 
was more, as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always car- 
ried them out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my 
goat-skin belt. I also furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I 
had out of the ship, and made me a belt to hang it on also ; so that I 
was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I went abroad, if 
you add to the former description of myself the particular of two 
pistols and a great broadsword hanging at my side in a belt, but 
without a scabbard. 

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed, ex- 
cepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm, sedate way 
of living. All these things tended to show me more and more, how 
far ray condition was from being miserable, compared with some 
others ; nay, to many other particulars of life, which it might have 
I)leased God to have made my lot. It put me updn reflecting how 
little repining there would be among mankind at any condition of 
life, if people would rather compare their condition with 'those that 
were worse, in order to be thankful, than be always comparing them 
with those which are better, to assist their murmurings and com- 
plainings. ^ 

As in my present condition there were not really many thinsrs 
which I wanted, so, indeed, I thought that the frights I had been in 
about these savage wretches, and the concern I had been in for my 
own preservation, had taken off the edge of my invention for my 
own qonveniences ; and I had dropped a good design, which I had 



fc 



116 KeSINSOK €KIJS0E. 

once bent my thougbts too much upon, and that was to try if I could 
not make some of my barley into malt, and then try to t)rew myself 
some beer. This was really a whimsical thought, and I reproved 
myself often for the simplicity of it ; for I presently saw there would 
be ihe want of several things necessary to the malung my beer, that 
it would be impossible for me to supply ; as, first, casks to preserve 
it in, which was a thing that, as I have observed already, I could 
never compass : no, though I spent not only many days, but weeks, 
nay, mouths, in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next place, 
I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper 
or kettle to make it boil ; and yet with all these things wanting, I 
verily believe, had not the frights and terrors I was in about the 
savages intervened, I had imdertaken it, and perhaps brought it to 
pass, too ; for I seldom gave anything over without accomplishing it, 
when once I had it in my head to begm it. But my invention now ran 
quite another way ; for, night and day, I could think of nothing but 
how I might destroy some of these monsters ip their cruel, bloody 
entertainment, and, if possible, save the victim they should bring 
hither to destroy. It would take up a larger volume than this whole 
work is Intended to be, to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or 
rather brooded upon, in my thoughts, for the destroying these creat- 
ures, or at least frightening them so as to prevent their coming 
hither any more : but all this was abortive ; nothing could be possible 
to take effect, imless I was to be there to do it myself : and what 
could one man do among them, when perhaps there might be twenty 
or thirty of them together with their darts, or their bows and arrows, 
with which they could shoot as true to a mark as I could with my 
gun? 

Sometimes I thought of digging a hole under the place where they 
made their fire, and putting in Qvo or six pounds of gunpowder, 
which, when they kindled their fire, would consequently take fire 
and blow up all that was near it ; but as, in Uie first place, I should 
be unwilling to waste so much powder upon them, my store being 
now within the quantity of one barrel, so neither could I be sure of 
its going off at any certain time, when it might surprise them ; 
and, at best, that it would do little more than just blow the fire about 
their ears and fright them, but not sufficient to make them forsake the 
place : so I laid it aside ; and then proi)used that I would place myself 
in ambush in some convenient place, with my three guns all double 
loaded, and in the middle of their bloody ceremony let fly at them, 
when I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every 
shot ; and then falhng in upon them with my three pistols and my 
sword, I made no doUbt but that, if there were twenty, I should kill 
them all. This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and I 
was so full of it that I often dreanj^ed of it, and sometimes that I 
was just going to let fly at them in my sleep. I went so far with it 
m my imagination that I employed myself several days to find out 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 117 

• 

proper places to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to watch for 
them, and 1 went frequently to the place itself, which was now 
grown more familiar to me ; but while my mind was thus filled with 
tiioughts of revenge and a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them 
to the sword, as I may nal\ it, the horror I had at the place, and at 
the signals of the barbarous wretches devouring one another, abetted 
my malice. Well, at length I found a place in the side of the hill, 
where I was satisfied I mi^ht securely wait till I saw any of their 
boats coming ; and might then, even before they would be ready to 
come on shore, convey myself unseen into some thickets of trees, in 
one of which there was a hollow large enough to conceal me entirely ; 
and there I might sit and observe all their bloody doings, and take 
my full aim at their heads, when they were so close together as that 
it would be next to impossible that I should miss my shut, or that I 
could fail wounding three or four of them at the first shot. In this 
place, then, I resolved to fulfil my design ; and accordingly 1 pre- 
pared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece. The two mus- 
kets I loaded with a brace of slugs each and four or five smaller 
bullets, about the size of pistol bullets ; and the fowling-piece I 
loaded with near a handful of swan shot of the largest size ; I also 
loaded my pistols with about four bullets each ; and, in this posture, 
well provided with ammunition for a second and third charge, I pre- 
pared myself for my expedition. 

After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my imagina- 
tion put it in practice, I continually made my tour every morning to 
the top of the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about 
three miles, or more, to see if I cimld oliserve any boats upon the sea, 
coming near the island, or standing over toward it ; but I began to 
tire of this hard duty, after I had for two or three months constantly 
kept my watch, but came always back without any discovery ; there 
having not, in all that time, been the least appearance, not only on 
or near the shore,^ut on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glass 
could reach every way. 

As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out, so long also 
I kept up the vigor of my design, and my spirits seemed to be all the 
while in a suitable form for so outrageous an execution as the 
killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for an offence which I had not 
at all entered into any discussion of in my thoughts, any further than 
my passions were at first fired by the horror I conceived at the un- 
natural custom of the people of that country ; who, it seems, had 
been suffered by Providence, in his wise disposition of the world, to 
have no other guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated 
passions ; and, consequently, were left, and perhaps had l)een so for 
some ages, to act such horrid thmgs, and receive such dreadful cus- 
toms, as nothing but nature, entireiy abandoned by Heaven, and actu- 
ated by some h^Iish degeneracy, could have run them into. But now 
when, as I have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless excursion 



1 



118 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

• 
which I had made so long and so far every morning in vain, so my 
opinion of the action itself began to alter ; and I began, with cooler 
and calmer thoughts, to consider what I was going to engage in ; 
what authority or call I had to pretend to be judge and executioner 
upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit, for so 
many ages, to suffer, unpunished, to go on, and to be, as it were, 
the executioners of his judgments one upon another ; how far these 
people were offenders against me, and what right 1 had to engage in 
the quarrel of that blood which they shed promiscuously upon one 
another. I debated this very often with myself tlius : '* How do I 
know what God himself judges in this particular case ? It is certain 
these people do not commit this as a crime ; it is not against their 
own consciences reproving, or their light reproaching them ; they do 
not know it to be an offence, and then commit it in defiance of divine 
justice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit. They think it no 
more a crime to kill a captive taken in war than we do to kill an ox ; 
or to eat human flesh than we do to eut mutton." 

When I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I was cer- 
tainly in the wrong ; that these people were not murderers, in the sense 
that I liad before condemned them in my thoughts, any more than 
those Christians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners 
taken in battle ; or more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole 
troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they 
threw down their arms and submitted. In the next place, it oc- 
curred to me that although the usage they gave one another was 
thus brutish and inhuman, yet it was really nothing to me — these 
people had done me no injury ; that if they attempted, or I saw it 
necessary, for my immediate preservation, to fall upon them, some- 
thing might be said for it ; but that I was yet out of their power, 
and they really had no knowledge of me, and consequently no design 
upon me ; and therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon 
them ; that this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards in all 
their barbarities practised in America, where they destroyed millions 
of these people ; who, however they were idolaters and barbarians, 
and had several bloody and barbarous rites in their customs, such as 
sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, 
very innocent people ; and that the rooting them> out of the country 
is spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detestation by even the 
Spaniards themselves, at this time, and by all other Christian nations 
in Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece of 
cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man ; and for which the venr 
name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all 
people of humanity or of Christian compassion ; as if the kingdom of 
Spain were particularly eminent for the produce of a race of men 
who were without principles of tenderness, or the common bowels of 
pity to the miserable, which is recKoned to be a mark of generous 
temper in the mind.

KOBINSOK CRUSOE. 119 

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of a 
full stop ;• and I began, by little and little, to be off my design, and 
to conclude I had taken wrong measures in my resolution to attack 
the savages ; and that it was not my busiuess to meddle with (hem, 
unless they first attacked me ; and this it was my business, if possi- 
ble, to prevent ; but that, if I were discovered and attacked by 
them, I knew my duty. On the other hand, I argued with myself, 
that this really was the way not to deliver myself, but entirely to 
ruin and destroy myself ; for, unless I was sure to kill every one that 
not only should be on shore at that time, biit that should ever come 
on shore afterward, if but one*of them escaped to lell their country- 
people what had happened, they would come over again by thousands 
to revenge the death of their fellows, and I should only bring upon 
myself a certain destruction, which, at present, I had no manner of 
occasion for. Upon the whole, I concluded that I ought, neither in 
principle nor in policy, one way or other, to concern myself in this 
affair : that my business was, by all possible means, to conceal myself 
from them, and not to leave the least sign for them to guess by that 
there were any living creatures upon the island — I mean of human 
shape. Keligion joined in with this prudential resolution ; and I 
was convinced now, many ways, that I was perfectly out of my 
duty when I was laying all my bloody schemes for the destruction 
of innocent creatures — I mean innocent as to me. As to the crimes 
they were guilty of toward one another, I had nothing to do with 
them ; they were national, and I ought to leave them to the justice 
of God, who is the Governor of nations, and knows how, by national 

gunishments, to make a ju^t retribution for national offences, and to 
ring public judgments upon those who offend in a public manner, 
by such ways as best please him. This appeared so clear to me 
now that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me than that I had 
not been suffered to do a thing which-I now saw so much reason to 
believe wouW have been no less a sin than that of wilful murder, if 
I had committed it ; and I gave most humble thanks, on my knees, 
to God, that he had thus delivered me from blood-guiltiness ; be- 
seeching him to grant me the protection of his providence, that I 
might not fall into the hands of the barbarians, or that I might not 
lay my hands upon them, unless I had a more clear call from Heaven 
to do it, in defence of my own life. 

In this disposition I continued for near a year after this ; and so 
far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these wretches 
that in all that time I never once went up the hill to see whether 
there were any of them in sight, or to know whether any of them 
had been on shore there or not, that I might not be tempted to renew 
any of my contrivances against theni, or be provoked, by any advan- 
tage that might present itself, to fall upon them : only this I did ; I 
went and removed my boat, which I had on the other side of the isl- 
and, and carried it down to the east end of the whole island, where I 



120 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

ran it into a little cove which I fount! under some high rocks, and 
where 1 knew, by reason of the currents, the savas^es durst not, at 
least would not, come with their boats upon any account whatever. 
With my boat I carried away everything that I had left there be- 
longing to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither, viz., 
a mast and sail which I had made for her, and a thing like an anchor^ 
but which indeed could not be calletl either anchor or grapnel ; 
however, it was the best I could make of its kind : all these I re- 
moved, that there might not be the least shadow for discovery, or 
appearance of any boat, or of any human habitation upon the island. 
Besides this, 1 kept myself, as I saicl, more ittired than ever, and 
seldom went from my cell except upon my constant employment, to 
milk my she-goats, and manage my little nock in the wood, which, 
as it was quite on the other part of the island, was out of danger ; for 
certain it is that these savage people, who sometimes haunted this 
island, never came with any" thoughts of finding anything here, and 
consequently never wandered off from the coast, and I doubt not but 
they might have been several times on shore after my apprehensions 
of them had made me cautious, as well as before. Indeed, I looked 
back with some horror upon the thoughts of what my condition 
would have been if I bad chopped upon them and been discovered 
before that ; when, naked and unarmed, except with one gun, and 
that loaded often only with small shot, I walked everywhere, peep- 
ing and peering about the island to see what I could ge<; ; what a 
surprise should I have been in, if. when I discovered the print of a 
man's foot, I had, instead of that, seen fifteen or twenty savages, and 
found them pursuing me, and, by the swiftness of their running, no 
possibility of my escaping them I the thoughts of this sometimes 
sunk my very soul within me, and distressed my mind so much that 
I could not soon recover it, to think what I should have done, and 
how I should not only have been unable to resist them, but even 
should not have had presence of mind enough to do what I might 
have done ; much less what now, after so much consideration and 
preparation, I might be able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking 
of these things, 1 would be very melancholy, and sometimes it 
would last a great while ; but I resolved it all, at last, into thankful- 
ness to that Providence which had delivered me from so many unseen 
dangers, and had kept me from those mischiefs which I could have 
no way been the agent in delivering myself from, because I had not 
the least notion of any such thing depending, or the least supposition 
of its being possible. This renewed a contemplation wliich often 
had come into my thoughts in former times, when first I began to 
see the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in the dangei-s we run 
through in this life ; how wonderfully we are delivered when we 
know nothing of it ; how, when we are in a quandary (as we call it), 
a doubt or hesitation whether to go this way or that way, a secret 
hint ahaU direct us this way, when we intended to go that way ; 




nay, when sense, cBSKNl-indliDsmcm^slTlcF perhaps business, has 
called us to go the other way, yet a strange impression upon the 
mind, froui wc know not what springs, and by we know not what 
power, shall overrule us to go this way ; and it shall afterward ap- 
pear that had we gone that way, which we should have' gone, and 
even to our imagination ought to have gone, we should have been 
ruined and lost. Upon these, and many like reflections, I afterward 
made it a certain rule witu me, that whenever I found those secret 
hints or pressings of mind, to doing or not doing anything that pre- 
sented, or going this way^ or that way, I never failed to obey the 
secret dictate ; though I knew no other reason for jt than that such a 
pressure, or such a hint, hung upon m^ mind. I could give many 
examples of the success of tliis conduct in the course of my life, but 
more especially in the latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy island ; 
besides many occasions which it is very likely I might have taken 
notice of, if I had seen with the same eyes then that I see with now. 
But it is never too late to be wise ; and I cannot but advise all con- 
sidering men, whose lives are attended with such extraordinary in- 
cidents as mine, or even though not so extraordinary, not to slight 
such secret intimations of iProvidencc, let them come from what in- 
visible intelligence they will. That I shall not discuss, and perhaps 
cannot account for ; but certainly they are a proof of the converse 
of spirits, and a secret communication between those embodied and 
those unei^bodied, and such a proof as can never be withstood ; of 
which I shall have occasion to give some very remarkable instances 
in the remainder of my solitary residence in tUis dismal place. 

I believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I confess 
that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the con- 
cern that was now upon me, put an end to all invention, and to all 
the contrivances that 1 had laid for my future accommodations and 
conveniences. I had the care of my safety more now upon my hands 
than that of my food. I cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of 
wood now, for fear the noise I might make should be heard ; much 
less would I fire a gun for the same reason : and, above all, I was 
intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible 
at a great distance in the day. should betray me. For this reason I 
removed that part of my business which required flre, such as burn- 
ing of pots and pipes, etc., into my new apartment in the woods ; 
where, after I had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable con- 
solation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which went in a vast way, 
and where, I dare say, no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, 
would be so hardy as to venture in ; nor, indeed, would any man 
else, but one who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat. 

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, where 
{by mere accident, I would say, if I did not see abundant reason to 
ascribe all such things now to Providence) I was cutting down some 
thick branches of trees to make charcoal ; and before I go on I must 



122 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



observe the reason of my making this charcoal, which was thus ; I 
was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I said before ; 
and yet I could not hve there without baking my bread, cooking my 
meat, etc.;. so I contrived, to burn some wood here, as I had seen 
done in England, under tiirf, till it became chark or dry coal ; and 
then putting the fire out, I preserved the coal to carry home, and 
perform the other services for which fire was wanting, without 
danger of smoke. But this is by the bye. While I was cutting 
down some wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick bmnch 
of low brushwood or underwood there was a kind of hollow place : 
I was curious to look in it ; and getting with difilculty into the 
mouth of it, I found it was pretty large — that is to say, sufficient for 
me to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with me : but I must 
confess to you that I made more haste out than I did in, when look- 
ing farther into the place, and which w^as perfectlj' dark, I saw two 
broad shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or man I knew 
not, which twinkled like two stars ; the dim light from the cave's 
mouth shining directly in, and making the refieclion. However, after 
some pause, 1 recovered myself and beffan to call m.vself a thousand 
fools, and to think that he that was afraid to see the devil was not 
fit to live twenty years in an island all alone : and that I might well 
think there was nothing in this cave that was more frighiful than 
myself. Upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up a tirebraud, 
and in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my hand : I had not 
gone three steps in t)efore I was almost as much frightened as l)e- 
fore ; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain, 
and it was followed by a broken noise, as of words half expressed, 
and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and was indeea struck 
with such a surprise that it put me into a cold sweat, and if I had had 
a hat on my head, I will not answer for it that my hair might not 
have lifted it off. But still plucking up my spirits as well as 1 could, 
and encouraging myself a little with considering that the ppwer and 
presence of God was everywhere, and was able to protect me, I 
stepped forward again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding it 
up a little over my head, I saw lying on the ground a monstrous, 
frightful, old he-goat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping 
for life, and dying, indeed, of mere old age. I siirrea him a little to 
see if I could get him out, and he essayed to get up, but was not able 
to raise himself ; ami I thought with myself he might even lie there 
— for if he had frightened me so he would certainly fright any of 
the savages, if any one of them should be so hardy as to come in there 
while he had any life in him. 

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round 
me, when I found the cave was but very small ; that is to say, it 
might be about twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, neiVher 
round nor square, no hands having ever been employed ia making it 
but those of mere nature. I observed also that there was a place at 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 133 

the farther side of it that went ia farther, but was so ]ow that it re- 
quired me to creep upon my hands and knees to go into it, and 
whither it went I knew not ; so, having no candle. I gave it over for 
that lime, but resolved to come again the next day provided with 
candles and a tinder-box, which I. had made of the lock of one of the 
muskets, with some wildfire in the pan. 

Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with six large candlos 
of my own making (for I made very good candles now of goals' 
tallow, but was hard set for candle-wick, using sometimes nigs or 
rope-yarn, and sometimes the dried rind of a weed like nettles); and 
going into this low place I was obliged to creep upon all-fours, as I 
have said, almost teii yards — which, by the way, I 'thought was a 
venture bold enough, considering that I knew not how far it might 
go, nor v^at was beyond it. When I had got through the straii, 
I found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty feet ; but 
never was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it 
was to look round the sides and roof of this vault or cave — the wall 
reflected a hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles. 
What it was in the rock — whether diamonds, or any other precious 
stones, or gold — which 1 rather supposed it to be— I knew not. The 
place I was in was a most delightful cavity, or grotto, though per- 
fectly dark ; the floor was dry and level, and had a sort of a small 
loose gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous or venomous 
creature to be seen, neither was there any damp or wet on the sides 
or roof : the only difficulty in it wais the entrance — which, however, 
as it was a place of security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought 
was a convenience, so that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and 
resolved, without any delay, to bring some of those things which I 
was most anxious about to this place ; particularly, I resolved to 
bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my spare arms — viz., 
two fowling-pieces — for I had three in all — and three muskets — for 
of them I had eight in all ; so I kept in m^ castle only five, which 
stood ready mounted like pieces of cannon on my outmost fence, and 
were ready also to take out upon any expedition. Upon this occa- 
sion of removing my ammunition, I happened to open the barrel of 
powder which I took up out of the sea, and which had been wet, 
and 1 found that the water had penetrated about three or four inches 
into the powder on every side, which, caking and growing hard, had 
preserved the inside like a kernel in the shell, so that I had near 
sixty pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask. This 
was a very agreeable discovery to me at that time ; so I carried all 
away thither, never keeping above two or three pounds of powder 
with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind ; I also car- 
ried thither all the lead I had left for bullets. 

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who were said 
to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come at 
them ; for I persuaded myself, while I was here, that if five hundred 



124 ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 

savages were to hunt me, they could never find me out — or if they 
did, Ihey would not venture to attack mo here. The old goat whom 
I found expiring died in the mouth of the cave the next day after I 
made this discovery ; and 1 found it much easier to dig a great hole 
there, and throw bim in and cover him with ^rth, than to drag him 
out ; so I interred hiai there, to prevent offence to my nose. * 

I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in tliis island, 
and was so naturalized to the place and the manner of liviuff that, 
could I l)ut have.enjoyed tlie certainty that no savages would come 
to the place to disturb me, I could have been content to have capitu- 
lated for spending the rest of my time there, even to the last mo- 
ment, till I had laid me down and died, like the old goat in the cave. 
I had also arrived to some little diversions and amusements, which 
made the time pass a great deal more pleasantly with me than it did 
before ; first, I had taught my Poll, as I named before, to speak ; and 
he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain, that it 
was very pleasant to me, for I believe no bird ever spcke pliiiner — and 
he lived with me no less than six-apd-tweniy years ; how long he 
might have lived afterward I know not, though I know they have a 
notion in the Brazils that they live a hundred years. My dog was a 
pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than sixteen years 
of my time, and then died of mere old age. As for my cats, they 
multiplied, as I have observed, to that degree that I was obliged to 
shoot several of them at first, to keep them from devouring me and 
all 1 had ; but at length, when the two old ones I brought with me 
were gone, and after some time continually driving them from me, 
and letting them have no provision with me, thej' all ran wild into 
the woods, except two or three favorites, which I kept tame, and 
whose 3'^oung, when they had any, I always drowned ; and these 
were part of my family. Besides these I always kept two or three 
household kids about me, whom I taught to feed out of my hand ; 
and I had two more parrots, which talked pretty well, and would all 
call ** Robin Crusoe," hxk none like my first ; nor, indeed, did I take 
the pains with any of them that I had done with him. I had also 
several tame sea-fowls, whose name I knew not, that I caught upon 
the shore, and cut their wings ; and the little stakes which I had 
planted before my castle- wall being now grown up to a good thick 
grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees, and bred there, 
which was very agreeable to me, so that, as I said above, I began to 
be very well contented with the life I led, if I could have been se- 
cured from the dread of the savages. But it was otherwise directed ; 
and it may not be amiss for all people who shall meet with my story 
to make this just observation from it — how frequently, in tlie course 
of our lives, the evil whieh in itself we seek most to shun, and which^ 
when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the 
very means or door of onr deliverance, by which alone we can be 
raised again from the afiiictiou we are fallen into* 1 could givQ

many examples of this in the course of my unaccountable life ; but 
in nothing was it moUe particularly remarkable than in the circum- 
stances of my last yean, of solitary residence in this island. 

It was now the mouth of Dwember, as I said above, in my 
twenty- third j^ear ; and this, being (he southern solstice (for winter 
I cannot call it), was the particular time of my harvest, and requh*ed 
me to be pretty much abroad in the fields, when, going out early in 
the morning, even before it was through daylight, I was surprised 
with seeing a light of some fire upon the shore, at a distance from me 
of about two miles, toward that part of the island where I had ob- 
served some savages had been, as before, and not on the other side ; 
hut, to my great afl3iction, it was on my side of the island. 

1 was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short 
within my grove^ not daring to go out lest I might be surprised ; 
and yet I had no more peace within, from the apprehensions 1 had 
that if these savages, in rambling over the island, should find my 
corn standing or cut, or any of my works and improvements, they 
would immediately conclude that there were people in the place, and 
would then never rest till they had found me out. In this extremity 
1 went back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me, and 
made all things without look as wild and natural as I could. 

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of 
defence ; I loaded all my cannon, as I called them — that is to say, my 
muskets, which were mounted upon my new fortification — and all my 
pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the last gasp, not forgetting 
seriously to commend myself to the Divine protection, and earnestly 
to pray to God to deliver me out of the bauds of the barbarians. I 
continued in this posture about two hours, and began to be impatient 
for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send out. After sitting 
awhile longer, and musing what I should do in this case, I was not 
able to bear sitting in ignorance any longer ; so setting up my ladder 
to the side of the hill, where there was a flat place, as I observed 
before, and then pulling the ladder after me, I set it up again, and 
mounted the top of the hill, and pulling out my perspective-^lass, 
which I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on 
the ground, and began to look for the place. I presently found there 
were no less than nine naked savages, sitting round a small fire they 
had made, not to warm them, for they had no need of that, the 
weather being extremely ho*;, but, as I supposed, to dress some of 
their barbarous diet of human flesh whicii they had brought with 
them, whether alive or dead I could not tell. 

They had two canoes with them, which they had haufed up upon 
the shore ; and as it was then ebb of tide they seemed to me to wait 
for the return of the flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine 
what confusion this sight put me into, especially seeing them come 
on my side of the island, and so near to me ; but when I considered 
their coming must be always with the current of the ebb, I began 



'* 



l26 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

afterward to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might 
go abroad with safety all the time of the flood- of tide, if they were 
not on shore before ; and having made this observation I went 
abroad about my harvest work with the more composure. 

As I expected, so it proved ; for, as soon as the tide made to the 
westward, I saw them all take boat and row (or paddle, as we call it) 
away. I should have observed, that for an hour or more before they 
went off they were dancing, and I could easily discern their postures 
ahd gestures by my glass. I could not perceive, by my nicest obser- 
vation, but that*they were stark naked, and had not the least covering 
upon them ; but whether they were men or women I could not dLs- 
tioguish. 

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon 
my shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my great sword by 
my side without a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to 
make went away to the hill where 1 had discovered the first appear- 
ance of all ; and as soon as I got thither, which was not in less than 
two hours (for I could not go quickly, being so loaded with arms as 
I was), I perceived there had been three canoes more of the savages 
at that place ; and looking out farther, I saw they were all at sea to- 
gether, making over for the main. This was a dreadful sight to me, 
especially as, going down to the shore, I could see the mfirks of 
horror T\jhich the dismal work they had been about had left behind it, 
viz , the blood, the bones, and part of the flesh of human bodies eaten 
and devoured by those wretches with merriment and sport. I was 
so filled with indignation at the sight that I now began to premedi- 
tate the destruction of the next that I saw there, let them be whom 
or how many soever. It seemed evident to me that the visits which 
they made thus to this island were not very frequent, for it was above 
fifteen months before any more of them came on shore there again — 
that is to say, 1 neither saw them nor any footsteps or signals of them 
in all that time ; for as to the rainy seasons, then they are sure not 
to come abroad, at least not so far ; yet all this while 1 lived uncom- 
fortably, by reason of the constant apprehensions of their coming 
upon me by surprise ; from whence I observed, that the expectation 
of evil is more bitter than the suffering, especially if there is no room 
to shake off that expectation or those apprehensions.. 

During all this time I was in the murdering humor, and spent 
most of my hours, which should have been better employed, in con- 
triving how to circumvent and fall upon them the very next time I 
should see them— especially if they should be divided, as they were 
the Inst time, into two parties ; nor did I consider at all that if I 
killed one party — suppose ten or a dozen — I was still the next day, 
or week, or month, to kill another, and so another, even ad infiniiumf 
till I should be, at length no less a murderer than they were in being 
man-eaters — and perhaps much more so. I spent my days now in 
great perplexity and anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one

day or other fall into the handa of these merciless creatures ; and if I 
did at any lime venture abroad, it was not without looking around 
me with the greatest care and caution imaginable. And now I 
found, to my great comfort, how happy it was that I had provided a 
tame flock or herd of goats ; for I durst not upon any account fire 
my gun, especially near that side of the island where they usually 
came, lest I should alarm the savages ; and if they had fled from mg 
now,. I was sure to have them come again with perhaps two or three 
hundred canoes with them in a few days, and then I knew what to 
expect. However, I wore out a year and three months more before 
I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I found them agaia, 
as I shall soon observe. It is true they might have been there oucq 
or twice ; but either they made no stay, or at least I did not see 
them ; but, in the month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in ' 
my four-and-twentieth year, I had a very strange encounter with 
them ; of which in its place. 

The perturbation of my mind, during this flfteen or sixteen 
months' interval, was very great ; I slept unquietly, dreamed always 
frightful dreams, and often starUid out of my sleep in the night. In 
the day, great troubles overwhelmed mv miud ; and in the night I 
dreamed often of killing the savages, and of the reasons why I might 
justify doing it. But to waive all this for a while. It was in the 
middle of May, on the sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor 
wooden calendar would reckon, for I marked all upon the post still ; 
I say, it was on the sixteenth of May that it blew a very great storm 
of wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and thunder, and a 
very foul night it was after it. I knew not what was the particular 
occasion of it ; but as I was reading in the Bible, and taken up with 
very serious thoughts about my present condition, I was surprised 
with the noise of a gnn, as I thought, fired at sea. This was, to be 
sure, a surprise quite of a different nature from any I had met with 
before ; for the notions this put into my thoughts were quite of an- 
other kind. I started up in the i^reatest haste imaginable ; and, in a 
trice, clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock, and pulled 
it after me ; and mounting it the second time, got to the top of the 
hill the very moment that a flash of fire bid me listen for a second 
gun, which, accordingly, in about half a minute, I heard -, and by 
the sound, knew that it was from that -part of the sea where I was 
driven down the current in my boat. I immediately considered that 
this must be some ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, 
or some other ship in company, and fired these for signals of dis- 
tress, and to obtain help. 1 had the presence of mind, at that 
minute, to think, that though I could not help them, it miffht be they 
might help me ; so I brought together all the dry wood i could get 
at hand, and making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the 
hill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely ; and though the wind 
blew very hard, yet it burned fairly out, so that I was ceitain, if there 






128 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

was any such thing as a ship, they must need see it, and no douht 
they did ; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up I heard another 
gun, and after that several others, all from the same -quarter. - I 
pliefl my fire all night long, till daybreak : and when it was broad 
day, and the air cleared up,'I saw something at a great distance at 
sea, full east of the island, whether a sail or a hull I could nf)t dis- 
tinguish — no, not with my glass ; the distance was so great and the 
weather still something hazy also ; at least, it was so out at sea. 

I looked frequently at it all that day, and «oon perceived that it did 
not move ; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor ; 
and being eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in 
my hand ana ran toward the south side of the island, to the rocks 
where I had formerly been carried away by the current ; and gettins 
up there, the weather by this time lieing perfectly clear, I could 
plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in 
the night upon those concealed rocks which I found when I was out 
in my boat ; and which rocks, as they checked the violence of the 
stream and made a kind of counter-stream or eddy, were the occa- 
sion of my recovering from the most desperate, hopeless condition 
that ever I had been in in all my life. Thus what is one man's 
safety is another man's destruction ; for it seems these men, whoever 
thev were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks being wholly 
unaer water, had been driven upon them in (he night, the wiud blow- 
ing hard at E.N.E. Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily 
suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have endeavored to 
have saved themselves on shore by the help of their boat ; but their 
firing off guns for help, especially when they saw, as I imagined, my 
fire, filled me with many thoughts. First, I imagined that upon see- 
ing my light they might have put themselves into their boat and 
endeavored to make the shore ; but that the sea running very high, 
they might have been oast away. Other times, I imagined that they 
might have lost their boat before, as might be the case many ways ; 
particularly by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which mai»y 
times obliged men to stave or take in pieces their boat, and some- 
times to throw it overboard with their own hands. Other times, 1 
imagined they had some other ship or ships in companj^ who, upon 
the signals of distress they made, had taken them up, and carried 
them off. Other times, I fancied they were all gone off to sea in 
their boat, and being hurried away by the current that I had he&a, 
formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean, where there waa 
nothing but misery and perishing ;'and that, perhaps, they might by 
this time think of starving, and of being in a condition to eat od»^ 
another. 

As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition I w«i 
in, I could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor msm 
and pity them ; which had still this good effect upon my side, tb^t H 
gave me more and more cause to give thanks to Qod, who had 0Q

happily and comfortably provided for me ia my desolate condition*: 
and that of two ships' companies, who were now cast away upon 
this part of the world, not one life should be spared but mine. I 
learned here again to observe, that it is very r^ e that the providence 
of God casts ns into any condition of life bo lo^, or anv misery so 
great, but we may see something or other to be thankful for, and may 
see others in worse circumstances than our own. Such certainly was 
the case of these men, of whom I could not so much as see room to 
suppose any of them were saved ; nothing could make it rational so 
much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish there, except 
the possibility only of their being taken up bv another ship in com- 
pany ; and this was but mere possibility inaeed, for I saw not the 
least sign or appearance of any such thing. I cannot explain, by any 
possible energy of words, what a strange longing I felt in my soiil 
upon this sight, breaking out sometimes thus : " O that there had 
been but one or two, nay, or but one soul, saved out of this ship, to 
have escaped to me, that I might but have had one companion, one 
fellow-creature, to have spoken to me and to have conversed with !" 
In all the time of my solitary life I never felt so earnest, so strong a 
desire after the society of my fellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at 
the want of it. ' • 

There Are some secret moving springs in the affections, which, 
when they are set a-going by some obiect in view, or, though not in 
view, yet rendered present to the mind by the power of imagination, 
that motion carries out the soul by its impetuosity to such violent, 
eager embracings of the object that the absence of it is insupportable. 
Such were these earnest wishings that but one man had been saved. 
I believe I repeated the words, '* O that it had been but one I** a 
thousand times ; and my desires were so moved by it that w^hen I 
spoke the words my hands would clinch together, and my fingers 
would press the palms of my hands, so that if I had bad any soft 
thing in my hand I would have crushed it involuntarily ; and the 
teeth in my head would strike together and set against one another so 
strong that for some time I could not part them again. Let the 
naturalists explain these things, and the reason and manner of them. 
All I can do is to describe the fact, which was even surprising to 
me, when I found it, though I knew not from whence it proceedad ; 
it was, doubtless, the effect of ardent wishes, and of strong ideas 
formed in my mind, realizing the comfort which the conversation 
of one of my fellow-Christians would have been to me. But it was 
not to be ; either their fate or mine, or both, forbade it, for till the 
last year of my being on this islaad, I never knew whether any were 
saved out of that ship or no ; aud had only the affliction, some days 
after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on shore at the end 
of the island whidi was next the shipwreck. He had no clothes on 
^bol a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a 
t^Soe linen shirt ; but nothing to direct me so much as to guess what 

R.C.--5 



130 ROBINSOiq- CRUSOE. 

nation he was of. He had nothiD^ in his pockets but two pieces-of- 
eight and a tobacco-pipe — the last was to me of ten times more value 
than the first. 

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat 
to this wreck, not doubling but I might find something on board that 
might be useful to me. But that did not altogether press me so 
much as the possibility that there might be yet some livmg creature 
on board, whose life 1 might not onlv save, but might, by saving 
that life, comfort my own to the last degree ; and this thought clung 
so to my heart that I could not be quiet night or day, but I must ven- 
ture out in my boat on board this wreck ; and conmiitting the rest 
to God's providence, I thought the impression was so strong upon 
my mind that it could not be resisted, that it must come from some 
invisible direction, and that I should be wanting to myself if I did 
not go. , 

Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my castle, 
prepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great 
pot of fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had 
still a great deal of that left), and a basket of raisins ; and thus, load- 
ing myself with everything necessary, I went down to my boat, got 
the water out of her, got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and 
then went home again for more. My second cargo was a great bag 
of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head ^or a shade, another 
large pot of fresh water, and about two dozen of small loaves, or 
barley-cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's milk and a 
cheese : all which with great labor and sweat I carried to my boat ; 
and praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out, and rowing, or 
padcfiing the canoe along the shore, came at last to the utmost point 
of the island on the north-east side. And now 1 was to launch out 
into the ocean, and either to venture or not to venture, , 1 looked on 
the rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides of the island at 
a distance, and which were, very terrible to me, from the remem- 
brance of the hazard I had been in before, and my heart began to 
fail me ; for I foresaw that if I was driven into either of those cur- 
rents I should be carried a great way out to sea, and perhaps out of 
my reach or sight of the island again ; and that then, as my boat 
was but small, if any little gale of wind should rise I should be in- 
evitably lost. 

These thoughts so oppressed my mind that I began to give over 
my enterprise ; and having hauled my boat into a little creek on the 
shore, I stepped out, and sat down upon a rising bit of ground, very 
pensive and anxious, between fear and desire, about my voyage ; 
when as I was musing I could perceive that the tide was turned, and 
the flood come on ; upon wliich, niy going was impracticable for so 
many hours. Upon this, presently it occurred to me that I should 
go up to the highest piece of ground I could find, and observe, if I 
could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay, when the flood camo 



R0BISrS02!f CRUSOE. 131 

in, that I might judge whether, if I was driven one way out, I might 
not expect lo be driven another way home, with the same rapidity of 
the currents. This thought was no sooner in my head than I cast 
my eye upon a little hill, which sufficiently overlooked the sea both 
ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the currents, or sets of 
the tide, and which way I was to guide myself in my return. Here 
I found that as the current of ebb set out close by the south point of 
the island, so the current of the flood set in close by the shore of the 
north side ; and that I had nothing to do but to keep to the north 
side of the island in my return, and I should do well enough. 

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved, the next morning, to 
set out with the first of the tide ; and, reposing myself for the night in 
my canoe, under the great watch-coat 1 mentioned, Ilauncbed out. I 
first made a little out to sea, full north, till I began to feel the benefit 
of the current, which set eastward, and which carried me at a great 
rate ; and yet did not so hurry me as the current on the south side 
had done before, so as to take from me all government of the boat ; 
but having a strong steerage with my paddle, I went, at a great rate, 
directly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came up to it. It 
was a dismal sight to look at : the ship, which, by its building, was 
Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two rocks : all the stern and 
quarter of her were beaten to pieces by the sea ; and as her fore- 
castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with great violence, her 
mainmast and foremast were brought by the board— that is to say, 
broken short off ; but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and 
bow appeared firm. When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon 
her, who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried ; and, as soon as I 
called him, jumped into the sea to come to me : I took him into the 
boat, but found him almost dead with hunger and thirst. I gave 
bim a cake of my bread, and he devoured it like a ravenous wolf that 
had been starving a fortnight in the snow : I then gave the poor 
creature some fresh water, with which, if I would have let him, he 
would have burst himself. After this I went on board ; but the first 
sight I met with was two men drowned in the cook-room or fore- 
castle of the ship, with their arms fast about one another. I con- 
cluded, as is indeed probable, that when the ship struck, it being in 
a storm, the sea broke so high and so continually over her that the 
men were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the constant 
Tushing in of the water, as much as if they had been under water. 
Besides the dog there was nothing left in the ship that had life ; 
nor any goods, that I could see, but what were spoiled by the water. 
There were some casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew 
not, which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed 
out, I could see ; but they were too big to meddle with. I saw 
several chests, which I believe belonged to some of the seamen ; and 
I got two of them into the boat, without examining what was in 
aSim, Had the stem of the ship been fixed, and the lore part

broken off, I am persuaded I might have made a good voyage ; for, 
by what I found in these two chests. I had room to suppose the ship 
had a great deal of wealth on board : and, if I may guess from the 
course she steered, she must h&ve been bound from Buenos Ayres, or 
the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of America, beyond the Bra- 
zils to the Havana, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. 
She had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no use, at that 
time, to anyl>ody ; but what l»ecame of the crew I then knew not. 

I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of about 
twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much difficulty. 
There were several muskets in the cabin, and a great powder-horn, 
with about four pounds of powder in it : as for the muskets, I had 
no occasion for them ; so I left them, but took the powder-'horn. £ 
took a fire-shovel and tongs, which I wanted extremely ; as also two 
little brass kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron ; 
and with this cargo aila the dog, I came away, the tide l^ginning 
to make home again ; and the same evening, about an hour within 
night, I reached the island again, weary and fatigued to the last de- 
gree. I reposed that night in the boat ; and in the morning I re- 
solved to harbor what I had got in my new cave, and not carry it 
home to my castle. After refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on 
shore, and began to examine the particulars. The cask of liquor I 
found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the Brazils ; 
and, in a word, not at all good ; but whei%I came to open the chests, 
I found several things of great use to me ; for example, I found in 
one a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with 
cordial waters, fine and very good ; the bottles held abqut three 
pints each, and were tipped with silver. I found two pots of very 
good succades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on the top that the 
salt water had not hurt them ; and two more of the same, which the 
water had spoiled. I found some very good shirts, which were very 
welcome to me : and about a dozen and a half of white linen hand-/ 
kerchiefs and colored neckcloths ; the former were also very wel- 
come, being exceedingly refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day. 
Besides this, when I came to the till in the chest , I found there three 
great bags of pieces-of -eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces 
in all ; and in one of them, wrapi>ed up in a paper, six dotibloons of 
gold and some small bars or wedges of gold ; I suppose they might 
all weigh near a pound. In the other chest were some clothes, but 
of little value ; but, by the circumstances, it must have belonged to 
the gunner's mate ; though there was no powder in it, except two 
pounds of fine glazed powder, in three small flasks, kept, I suppose, 
for chaining their fowling-pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, I 
got very little by this voyage that was of any use to me ; for, us to 
the money, I had no manner of occasion for it ; it was to mc as the 
dirt under my feet, and I would have given it all for three or four 
pairs of English shoes and stockings, which were things I greiU^y 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 133 

wanted, but had none on my feet for many years. I had, indeed, 
ffot two paiis of slioes now, which I took off the feet of the two 
drowned men whom I saw in the wreck, and I found two pair more 
in one of the chests, which were very welcome to me ; but they were 
not like our English shoes, either for ease or service, being rather 
what we call pumps than shoes. I found in this seaman's chest 
about fifty pieces-of -eight, in rials, but no gold : I suppose this be- 
longed to a poorer man than the other, which seemed to belong to 
some officer. Well, however, I lugged this money home to my cave, 
and laid it up, as I had done that before which I had brought from 
our own ship ; but it was a great pity, as I said, that the other p9rt 
of this ship had not come to my share ; for I am satisfied I might have 
loaded my canoe several times over with money ; and, thought I, if 
I ever escape to England, it might lie here safe enough till I come 
again and fetch it. 

Having now ])rought all my things on shore, and secured them, I 
went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to 
her old harbor, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way to 
my old habitation, where I found everything safe and quiet. I be- 
gan now to repose myself, live after mjr old fashion, and take care of 
my family affairs ; and for a while I lived easy enough, only tliat I 
was more vigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not 
go abroad so much ; and if, at any time, I did stir with any freedom, 
it was always to the east part of the island, where I was pretty well 
satisfied the savages never came, and where I could go without so 
many precautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition as I al- 
ways carried with me if I went the other way. 1 lived in this con- 
dition near two years more ; but my unlucky head, that was always 
to let me know it was born to make my body miserable, was all these 
two years filled with projects and designs, how, if it were possible, 
I might get away from this island ; for sometimes I was for making 
another voyage to the wreck, though mv reason told me that there 
was nothing left there worth the hazard of mv voyage ; sometimes 
for a ramble one way, sometimes another ; ana I believe verily if I 
had had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should have ventured 
to sea, bound anywhere, I knew not whither. I have been, in all 
my circumstances, \l memento to those who are touched with the gen- 
eral plague of mankind, whence, for aught I know, one half of 
their miseries flow ; 1 mean that of not being satisfied with the sta- 
tion wherein God and Nature hath placed them ; for, not to look 
back upon my primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my 
father, the opposition to which was, as I may call it, my original sin, 
my subsequent mistakes of the same kind had been the means of 
my coming into this miserable condition ; for had that Providence, 
which so happily seated me at the Brazils as a planter, blessed me 
with confined desires, and I could have been contented to have gone 
on gradually, I might have been by this time (I mean in the time of

my being in this island) one of the most considerable planters in the 
Brazils : nay, I am persuaded that by the improvements I had made 
in that little time I lived there, and Uie increase 1 should probably 
have made if I had remained, 1 might have been worth a hundred 
thousand moidores : and what business had 1 to leave a settled for- 
tune, a well-stocked plantation, improving and increasing, to turn 
supercargo to Guinea to fetch negroes, when patience and time 
would have so increased our stock at home that we could have 
bought them at our own door for those whose business it was to 
fetch them ? and though it had cost us something more, yet the 
difference of that price was by no means worth saving at so great a 
hazard. But as this is usually the fate of young lieads, so reflection 
upon the folly of it is as commonly the exercise of more years, or of 
the dear-bought experience of time : so it was with me now ; and 
yet so deep had the mistake taken root in my temper that I could 
not satisfy myself in my station, but was continually poring upon the 
means and possibility of my escape from this place : and that I may, 
with the greater pleasure to the reader, bring on the remaining part 
of my story, it may not be improper to give some account of my first, 
conceptions on the subject of this foolish scheme for my escape, and 
how and upon what foundation I acted. 

I am now to be supposed retired into my castle, after my late voy- 
age to the wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water, as 
usual, and my condition restored to what it was before : I had more 
wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was not at all the richer ; for 
I had no more use for it than the Indians of Peru had before the 
Spaniards came there. 

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the four- 
and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of solitude, 
I was lying in my bed or hammock, awake, very well in health, had 
no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, nor any uneasiness of 
mind more than ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes, that 
is, so as to sleep ; no, not a wink all night long, otherwise than as 
follows : It is impossible to set down the innumerable crowd of 
thoughts that whirled through that great thoroughfare of the brain — 
the memory, in this night's time: I ran over the whole history of 
m}*^ life in miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to my com- 
ing to this island, and also of that part of my life since I came to this 
island. In mjr reflections upon the state of my case since I came on 
shore on this island, I was comparing the happy posture of my affairs 
in the first years of my habitation here, with the life of anxiety, fear, 
and care, which I had lived in ever since I had seen the print of a 
foot in the sand ; not that I did not believe the savages had frequented 
the island even all the while, and might have been several hundreds 
of them at times on shore there ; but I had never known it, and was 
incapable of any apprehensions about it ; my salislaction was pei:- 
fect, though m3' danger was the same, and I was as happy in not 



ROBINSON" CRUSOE. 135 

knowing my dauger as if I had never really been, exposed to it. This 
funiished my thoughts with many very profitable reflections, and 
particularly this one : How infinitely good that Providence is, which 
has provided, in its government of mankind, such narrow bounds to 
his sight and knowledge of things ; and though he walks in the midst 
of so many thousand dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to 
him, would distract his mind and sink his spirits, he is kept serene 
and calm bv having the events of things hid from his eyes, and 
knowing nothing of the dangers which surround him. 

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came to 
reflect seriously upon the real danger 1 had been in for so many yeai*8 
in this very island, and how I had walked about in the greatest se- 
curity, and with all possible tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing 
but-the brow of a hill, a great tree, or the casual approach of night, 
had been between me and the worst kind of destruction, viz., that of 
» falling into the hands of cannibals and savages, who would have 
seized on me with the samg view as I would on a goat ..or a turtle ; 
and have thought it no more crime to kill and devour me than I did 
of a pigeon or a curlew. I would unjustly slander myself if I should 
say I was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose 
singular protection I acknowleged, with great humility, all these un- 
known deliverances were due, and without which I must inevitably 
have fallen into their merciless hands. 

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken 
up in considering the nature of these wretched creatures (I mean the 
savages), and how it came to pass in the world that the wise Govern- 
or of all things should give up any of his creatures to such inhu- 
manity, nay, to something so much below even brutality itself as to 
devour its own kind ; but as this ended in some (at that time) fruitless 
speculations, it occurred to me to inquire what part of the world 
these wretches lived in ? how far off the coast was from whence they 
came ? what they ventured over so far from home for ? what kind of 
boats they had ? and why I might not order myself and my business so 
that I might be as able to go over thither as they were to come to me ? 

I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do 
with myself when I went thither ; what would become of me if I feU 
into the hands of these savages ; or how 1 should escape them if they 
attacked me ; no, nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach 
the coast, and not be attacked by some or other of them, without any 
possibility of delivering myself ; and if I should not fall into their 
hands, what I should do for provision, or whither I should bend my 
course : none of these thoughts, I say, so much ,as came in my way ; 
but my mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in 
my boat to the mainland. I looked upon my present condition as 
the most miserable ihat could possibly be ; that I was not able to 
throw myselt into anything but death, that could be called worse ; 
and if I reached the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet with 



136 UOBINSON CRUSOE. 

relief, or I might coast along, as I did on the African shore, till I 
came to some inhabited country, and where I might find some relief ; 
and, after all, perhaps I might fall in with some Christian ship that 
might take me in ; and if the worst came to the worst, I could but 
die, which would put an end to all these miseries at once. Pray note, 
all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient temper, made 
desperate, as it were, by the long continuance of my troubles, and the 
disappointments I had met in the wreck I had been on board of, and 
where I had been so near obtaining what I so earnestly longed for, 
somebody to speak to, and to learn some knowledge from.themof the 
place where I was, and of the probable means of my deliverance. I 
was agitated wholly by these thoughts : all my Calm of mind, in my 
resignation to Providence, and waiting the issue of the dispositions of 
Heaven, seemed to be suspended ; anH I had, as it were, no power to 
turn my thoughts to anything but to the project of a voyage to the 
main,which came upon me with such force and such an impetuosity 
of desire that it was not to be resisted. 

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with 
such violence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and my pulse 
beat as if I had been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervor 
of my mind about it, Nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted 
with the very thoughts of it, threw me into a sound sleep. One 
would have thought I should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor 
of anything relating to it : but I dreamed that as I was going out in 
the morning as usual, from my castle, I saw upon the shore two 
canoes and eleven savages coming to land, and that they brought 
with them another savage, whom they were going to kill in order to 
eat him ; when, on a sudden, the savage that they were going to kill 
jumped away, and ran for his life ; and I thought, in my sleep, that 
he came running into my little thick grove before my fortification, to 
hide himself ; and that I, seeing him alone, and not perceiving that 
the others sought him that way, showed myself to him, and smiling 
upon him, encouraged him : that he kneelea down to me, seeming to 
pray me to assist him ; upon which I showed him my ladder, made 
him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he became my ser- 
vant ; and that as soon as I had got this man, I said to myself, ** Now 
I may certainly venture to the mainland, for this fellow will serve 
me as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for pro- 
visions, and whither not to go for fear of beings devoured ; what 
places to venture into, and what to shun." I waked with this 
thought ; and was under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the 
prospect of my escape in my dream that the aisappoiniments which 
1 felt upon coming to myself, and finding that it was no more than a 
dream, were equally extravagant the other way, and threw me into a 
very great dejection of spirits. 

iJpon this, however, I made this conclusion : that my only way to 
go about to attempt an escape was, if possible, to get a savage mto 



.1^ 



ROBIKSON CEU80B. 137 

my x>osscs8ion ; and, if possible, it should be one of their prisonei's, 
whom they had condemned to be eaten, and should bring hither to 
kill. But these thoughts still were attended with this difficulty, that 
it was impossible to effect this without attacking a whole caravan of 
them, ana killing them all ; and this was not only a very desperate 
attempt, and might miscarry, but, on the other hand, I greatly 
scrupled the lawfulness of it to myself ; and m^ heart trembled at 
the thoughts of shedding so much blood, though it was for my deliv- 
erance. I need not repeat, the argumeots which occurred to me 
against this, they being the same mentioned before ; but though I 
had other reasons to offer now, viz., that those men were enemies 
to my life, and would devour me if they could ; that it was self-pres- 
ervation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself from this death of 
a life, and was acting in my own defence as much as if thev were 
actuflJly assaulting me, ana the like — I say, though these things 
argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human blood for my de- 
liverance were very terrible to me, and such as I could by no meau3 
reconcile myself to for a great while. However, at last, after m my 
secret disputes with myself, and after great perplexities about it (for 
all these arguments, one way and another, struggled in my head a 
long time), the eager prevaihng desire of deliverance at length mas- 
tered all the rest ; and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these 
savage!^ into my hands, cost what it would. My next thing was to 
contrive how to do it, and this indeed was very difficult to resolve on ; 
but as I could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to 
put myself upon the watch, to see them when they came on shore, 
and leave the rest to the event ; taking such measures as the oppor- 
tunity should present, let what would be. 

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the scout 
as often as possible, and indeed so often that 1 was heartily tired of 
it ; for it was above a year and a half that I waited ; and for great part 
of that time went out to the west end, and to the south-west corner 
of the island almost every da}', to look for canoes, but none appeared. 
This was very discouraging, and began to trouble me much, though 
I cannot say that it did in this case (as it had done some time before) 
wear off the edge of my desire to the thing ; but the longer it seemed 
to be delayed the more eager I was for it : in a word, 1 was not at 
first so careful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being 
seen by them, as I was now eager to be upon them. Besides, I 
fanciea myself able to manage one, nay, two or three savages, if I 
had them, so as to make them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I 
ghould direct them, and to prevent their being able at any time to do 
me any hurt. It was a great while that I pleased myself with this 
affair ; but nothing still presented itself ; all my fancies and schemes 
came to nothing, for no savages came near me for a great while. 

About a year and a half after I entertained these notions (and by 
long musing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing, for want 



138 EOBINSON CRUSOE. 

of an occasion to put them into execution) I was surprised one morn- 
ing by seeing no less than five canoes all on shore together on my side 
the island, and the people who belonged to them all landed and out 
of my sight. The number of them broke all my measures ; for seeing 
so many, and knowing that they always came four or six, or some- 
times more in a boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to 
take my measures, to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed ; so 
lay still in my castle, perplexed and discomforted. However, I put 
myself into the same position for an attacji that I had formerly pro- 
vided, and was just ready for action, if anything had presented. 
Having waited a good while, listening to hear if they made any noise, 
at length, being very impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my 
ladder, and clambered up to the top of the hill, by my two stages, 
as usual ; standing so, however, that my heafl did not appear above 
the hill, so that they could not perceive me by any means. Here I 
observed, by the help of my perspective-glass, that they were no less 
than thirty in number ; that they had a fire kindled, and that they 
had meat dressed. How they had cooked it, I knew not, or what it 
was ; but they were all dancing, m I know not how many barbarous 
gestures and figures,' their own way, round the fire. 

White I was thus looking on them I perceived, by my perspective, 
two miserable wretches dragged from the boats, where, it seems, 
they were laid by, and were now brought out for the slaughter. I 
perceived one of them immediately fall ; being knocked down, I sup- 
pose, with a club, or wooden sword, for that was their way ; and 
two or three others were at work immediately, cutting him open for 
their cookery, while the other victim was left standing by himself, 
till they should be ready for him. In that very moment, this poor 
wretch, seeing himself a little at liberty, and unbound. Nature in- 
spired him with hopes of life, and lie started away from them, and 
ran with incredible swiftness along the sands directly toward me ; 
I mean toward that part of the coast where my habitation was. I 
was dreadfully frightened, I must acknowledge, when I perceived 
him run my way ; and especially when, as I thought, I saw him pur- 
sued by the whole body ; and now I expected that part of my dream 
was coming to pass, and that he would certainly tak« shelter in my 
grove : but I could not depend, by any means, upon my dream, that 
the other savages would npt pursue him thither and find him there. 
However, I kept my station, and my spirits began to recover when I 
found that there was not above three men that followed him ; and 
still more was I encouraged when 1 found that he outstripped them 
exceedingly in running, and gained ground on them ; so that if he 
could but hold out for half an hour I saw easily he would fairly get 
away from them all. 

Tliere was between them and my castle, the creek, which I men- 
tioned often in the first part of my story, where I landed my cargoes 
out of the ship-; and this I flaw plainly he must necessarily swim 



ROBINSOJC CRUSOE. 139 

over, or the poor wretch would be taken there ; but when the aava/?e 
escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though the tide was 
then up ; but plunging in, swam through in about thirty strokes, or 
thereabout, landed, and ran with exceeding strength and swiftness. 
When the three persons came to the creek I f oundf that two of them 
could swim, but the thurd could not, and that, standing on the otlier 
side, he looked at the others, but went np farther, and soon after 
went softly back agam ; which, as it happeued, was very well for 
him in the end. I observed that the two who swam were yet niore 
than twice as long swimming over the creek as the fellow was that 
fled from them. It came very warmly upon my thoughts, and in- 
deed irresistibly, that now was the time to get me a servant, and per- 
haps a companion or assistant ; and that I was plainly called by 
Providence to save this poor creature's life. I immediately ran 
down the ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, 
for they were both at the foot of the ladders, as I observed before, 
and getting up again with the same haste to the top of the hill, I 
crossed toward the sea ; and having a very short cut, and all down 
hill, placed myself in the way between the pursuers and the pur- 
sued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who, looking back, was at 
first perhaps as much frightened at me as at them ; but I beckoned 
with my hand to him to come back ; and in the mean time I slowly 
advanced toward the two that followed ; then rushing at once upon . 
the foremost I knocked him down with the stock of my piece. I 
was loath to fire, because I would not have the rest hear ; though at 
that distance it would not have been easily heard, and being out of 
sight of the smoke, too, they would not have known what to make of 
it. Having knocked this fellow down, the other who pursued him 
stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I advanced toward him : 
but as I came nearer I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, 
and was fitting it to shoot at me : so I was then obliged to shoot at 
him first, which I did, and killed him at the first shot. The poor 
savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw both his enemies 
fallen and killed, as he thought, y^t was so frightened with the fire 
and noise of my piece that he stood stock still, and neither came for- 
ward nor went backward, though he seemed rather inclined still to 
fly than to come on I hallooed" again to him, and made signs to 
come forward, which he easily understood, and came a little way ; 
then stopped again, and then a little farther, and stopped again ; 
and I could then perceiTe that he stood trembling, as if he had 
been taken prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as his two 
enemies were. I beckoned to him again to come to me, and 
gave him all the signs of encouragement that 1 could think 
of ; and he came nearer and nearer, kneeliug down every ten or 
twelve steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving his life. I 
smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come 
still nearer ; at length he. came close to me ; and then he kneeled 



140 BOBINSON CRUSOE, 

down again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon the ground, 
and, taking me by the foot, set my fo(Jt upon liis head ; tliis, it 
seems, was in token of swearing to be my slave forever. I took 
him up and made much of him, and encouraged him all I could. But 
there was more work to do yet ; for I peiceiv^ the savage whom I had 
knocked down was not killed, but stunned by the blow, and began to 
come to himself : so I pointed to him, and showed him the savage, 
that he was not dead : upon this he spoke some words to me, and 
though I could not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant 
to hear ; for they were the tirst sound of a man's voice that I had heard, 
my own excepted, for above twenty-five years. But there was no time 
for such reflections now ; the savage who was knocked down recov- 
ered himself so far as to sit up upon the ground, and I perceived that 
my savage began to be afraid ; but when I saw that, 1 presented my 
other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him : upon this, my sav- 
age, for so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my 
sword, which hung naked in a belt by my side, which I did. He no 
sooner had it but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow cut off his 
head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done it;, 
sooner or better ; which I thought very stran^je for one who, I had 
reason to believe, never saw a swoi*d in his lite before, except their 
own wooden swords ; however, it seems, as I learned afterward, 
they make their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is 
so hard, that they will even cut off heads with them, ay, and arms, 
and that at one blow too. When he had done this, he comes laugh- 
ing to me in sign of triumph, and brought me the sword again, and 
with abundance of gestures which I didnot understand, laid it down, 
with the head of the savage that he hitd killed, just before me. But 
that which astonished him most was to know how I killed the other 
Indian so far off ; so pointing to him, he made signs to me to let him 
go to him ; and I bade him go, as well as I could. When he came to 
him, he stood like one amazed, lookiug at him, turning him first on 
one side and then on the other ; looked at the wound the bullet had 
made, which it seems was just i^ his breast, where it had made a 
hole, and no great quantity of blood had followed ; but he had bled 
inwardly, for he was quite dead. He took up his bow and arrows, 
and came back ; so I turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow 
me, making signs to him that more might come after them. Upon 
this he made signs to me that he should bury them with sand, that they 
might n >t be seen by the rest, if they followed ; and so I made signs 
to him again to do so. He fell to work, and in an instant he had 
scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big enough to bury tho 
first in, and then dragged him into it, and covered him ; and did so 
by the other also ; I believe he had buried them both In a quarter of 
an hour. Then calling him away, I carried him, not to my castle, 
but quite away to my cave, on the farther part of the island : so I 
did not let my dream come to pass in that part,4;hat he came into m^- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 141 

grove, for shelter. Here I ^ijave him bread and a bunch of raisins to 
eat. and a draught of water, which I found he was indeed in great 
distress for, from his running : and having refreshed him, I made 
signs for him to go and lie down to sleep, showing him a place whci*e 
I had laid some rice-straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to 
sleep- upon myself sometimes ; so the poor creature lay down and 
went to sleep. 

He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with 
straight strong limbs, not too large, tall and well shaped ; and, as I reck- 
on, about twenty-six years of age. He had a very good countenance, 
not a fierce and surly aspect, out seemed to have something very 
manly in his face : and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of 
a European in his countenance too, especially when he smiled. His 
hair was long and black, not curled like wool ; his foi*ehead very 
high and large ; and a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his 
eyes. The color of his skin was not quite black, but very tawny ; 
and yet not an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and 
Virginians and other natives of America are, but of a bright kind of 
a dun olive color, that had in it something very agreeable, though 
not very easy to describe. His face was round and plump ; his nose 
small, not fiat like the negroes ; a very good moutii, thin lips, and 
his fine teeth well set, and as white as ivory. 

After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an hour, he 
awoke again, and came out of the cave to me ; for I had been milk- 
ing ray goats, which I had in the inclosure just by ; when he espied 
me. he came running to me, laying himself down again upon the 
ground, with all the possible signs of a humble, thankful disposition, 
making a great many antic gestures to show it. At last he lays his 
head flat upon the ground, close to my foot, and sets my other foot 
upon his head, as he had done before ; and after this made all the 
signs to me of subjection, servitude, and submission imaginable, to 
let me know how he would serve me so long as he lived. I under- 
stood him in many things, and let him know I was very well pleased 
with him. In a little time I be^an to speak to him, ana teach him to 
speak to me ; and, first, I let him know his name should be Friday, 
which was the day I saved his life : I called him so for the memory 
of the time. I likewise taught him to say Master ; and then let him 
know that was to be my name : I likewise taught him to say Yes 
and No, and to know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk 
in an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before him, and sop 
my bread in it ; and gave him a cake of bread to do the like, which 
he quickly coriiplied with, and made signs that it was very good for 
him. I kept there with him all that night ; but as soon as it was day 
I beckoned to him to coma willi me, and let him know I wouH give 
him some clothes ; at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark 
naked. As he went by the place where he had buried the two men, 
he pointed exactly to the place, and showed me the marks that he 



142 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



had made to find them again, making si^rn? to me that we should dig 
them up again and eat them. At Ihif • Mppeared very angry, ex- 
pressed my abhorrence of it, made :.= i' 1 would vomit at the 
thoughts of it, and beckoned with my ii i .. to him to come away, 
which he did immediately, with great submission. I then led him 
up to the top of the hill, to see if his enemies were gone ; and pull- 
ing out my glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place -whepe they had 
been, but no appearance of them or their canoes ; so that it was 
plain they were gone, and had left their two comrades behind them, 
without any search after them. 

But I was not content with this discovery ; but having now more 
courage, and consequently more curiosity, I took my man Friday 
with me, giving him the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows 
at his back, which I found he could use very dexterously, making 
him carry one gun for me, and I two for myself ; and away we 
marched to the place where these creatures had been ; for I had a 
mind now to get some fuller intelligence of them. When I came to 
the place my very blood ran chill in my veins, and my heart sunk 
within me at the horror of the spectacle ; indeed, it was a dreadful 
sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday made nothing of it. 
The place was covered with human bones, the ground dyed with 
their blood, and great pieces of flesh left here and there, half eaten, 
mangled, and scorched ; and,in short, all the tokens of the triumpbant 
feast they had been making there, after a victory over their enemies. 
I saw three skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four legs and 
feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies ; and Friday, by his 
signs, made me understand that they brought over four prisoners to 
feast upon ; that three of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing 
to himself, was the fourth ; that there had been a great battle be- 
tween them and their next king, of whose subjects, it seems, he had 
been one, and that they had taken a great number of prisoners ; all 
which were carried to several places, by those who had taken them 
in the fight, in order to feast upon them, as was done here by these 
wretches upon those they brought hither. 

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bcnes, flesh, and whatever 
remained, and lay them together in a heap, and make a great fire 
upon it, and bum them all to ashes. I found Friday had still a 
hankering stomach after some of the flesh, and was still a cannibal in 
his nature ; but I showed so much abhorrence at the verjr thoughts 
of it, and at the least appearance of it, that he durst not discover it ; 
for I had, by some means, let him know that I would kill him if he 
offered it. 

When he had done this, we came back to our castle ; and there I 
fell to work for my man Friday ; and first of all, I gave him a pair 
of linen drawers, which I had out of the poor gunner's chest I men- 
tioned, which I found in the wreck, and which, with a little altera- 
tion, fitted him very well ; and then I made him a jerkin of goat's 



?. 



EOBINSOK CBUSOE. 143 

skin, as "well as my skill would allow (for I was now grown a tolera- 
bly good tailor) ; and I gave him a cap which I made of hare's skin, 
very convenient, and fashionable enough ; and thus he was clothed, 
for the present, tolerably well, and was mighty well pleased to see 
himself almost as well clothed as his master. It is true, he went 
awkwardly in these clothes at first ; wearing Iho drawers was very 
awkward to him, and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his shoulders 
nud the inside of his arms ; but a little easing them where he com- 
plained they hurt him, and using himself to them, he took to them 
at length very well. 

The next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, I began to 
consider where I should lodge him ; and, that I might do well for 
him and yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him in 
the vacant place between my two fortifications, in the inside of the 
last, and in the outside of the first. As there was a door or entrance 
there into my cave, I made a formal framed door case, and a door to 
it of boards and set it up in the passage, a little within the entrance ; 
and causing the door to open in the inside, I barred it up in the 
night, taking in xay ladders, too ; bo that Friday could no way come at 
me in the inside of my innermost wall without making so much noise 
in getting over tliat it must needs awaken me ; for my first wall had 
now a complete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and 
leaning up to the side of the hill ; which was again laid across with 
smaller sticks, instead of laths, and then thatched over a great thick- 
ness with the rice straw, which was strong, like leeds ; and at the 
hole or place which was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had 
placed a kind of trap door, which, if it had been attempted on the out- 
side, would not have opened at all, but would have fallen down and 
made a great noise ; as to weapons, I took them all into my side 
every night. But I heeded none of all this precaution ; for never 
man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to 
me ; without passions, suUenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and 
engaged ; his very affections were tied to me, like those of a child to 
a faHier ; and I dare say he would have sacrificed his life to save mine, 
upon any occasion whatsoever : the many testimonies he gave me of 
this put it out of doubt, and soon convinced me that I neeided to use 
no precautions for my safety on his account. 

This frequently ^ve me occasion to observe, and that with won- 
der, that however it had pleased God in liis providence, and in the 
government of the works of his hands, to take from so great a part 
of the world of his creatures the best uses to which their faculties 
and the powers of their souls are adapted, yet that he has bestowed 
upon them the same powers, the same reason, the same affections ; 
the same sentiments of kindness and obligation ; the same passions 
and resentments of wrongs ; the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, 
fidelity, and all the capacities of doing good and receiving good, that 
he has isiTcn to us : and that v^hen he pleases to offer them occa*

sioDS of exerting tbese, they are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply 
tbcm to the right uses for which thejr were bestowed than we are. 
This made me very melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as tbe sev- 
eral occasions presented, how mean a use we make of all these, even 
thougli we bave these powers enlightened by the great lamp of in- 
struction, the Spirit or God, and by the knowledge of his word 
added to our understanding ; and why it has pleased God to hide the 
like saving knowledge from so many millions of souls; who, if I 
might judge by this poor savage, would make a much better use of it 
than we did. From hence I sometimes was led loo far, to invade 
tbe sovereignty of Providence, and, as it were, arraign the justice of 
so arbitrary a dist)osition of things, that should hide that sight from^ 
some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty from both ; 
but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts with this conclusion : 
first, that we did not know by what light and law these should be 
condemned ; but that as God was necessarily, and by the nature of 
hi» being, infinitely holy and just, so it could not be, but if theses 
creatures were all sentencefl to absence from himself, it was on ac- 
count of sinning against that light, which, as the Scriptures say, was 
a law to themselves, and by such rules as their consciences would 
acknowledge to be just, though the foundation was not discovered to 
us ; -and, secondly, that still, as we all are the clay in the hand of 
the potter, no vessel could say to him, ** Why hast thou formed me 
thus?" 

But to return to my new c<»npanion : I was greatly delighted 
with him, and made it my business to teach him eveiy thing that was 
proper to make him useful, handy, and helpful ; but especially to 
make him speak, and understand me when I spoke ; and ho was the 
aptest scholar that ever was ; and particularlv was so merry, so con- 
stantly diligent, and so pleased when he could but understand me, or 
make me understand him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk to 
him. Now my life began to be so easy that I began to say to my- 
self, that could I but have been safe from more savages, I cared not 
if I was never to remove from the place where I lived. 

After I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I thought 
that, in order to bring Friday ofit from bis horrid way of feeding, 
and from the relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him taste 
other flesh ; so I took him out with me one morning to the woods. I 
' went, indeed, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring 
it home and dress it ; but as I was goin^, 1 saw a she-goat lyin^ 
down in the shade, and two young kids sitting by her. I catched 
hold of Friday. ** Hold," said I ; " stand still ;" and made signs to 
him not to stir : immediately I presented my piece, shot, and killed 
one of the kids. The poor creature, who had, at a distance, indeed, 
seen me kill the savaee, his enemy, but did not know, nor could im- 
agine how it was done, was sensibly surprised ; trembled, and 
shook, and looked so amazed that I thought he would have sunk 



KOBINSOK CRUSOE. 145 

down. He did not see the kid I shot at, or perceive I had killed it, 
hut ripped up his waistcoat, to feel whether he was not wounded : 
and, as I found presently, thought I was resolved to kill him ; for he 
came and kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees, said a 
great many things I did not understand ; but I could easily see the 
meaning was, to pray me not to kill him. 

I soon found a way to convince him that 1 would do him no 
harm ; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing 
to the kid which 1 had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, 
which he did ; and while he was wondering, and looking to see how 
the creature was killed, I loaded my gun again. By and by I saw a 

freat fowl, like a hawk, sitting upon a tree within shot ; so, to let 
fViday understand a little what I would do, I called him to me 
again, pointed at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though I 
thought it had been a hawk ; I say, pointing to the parrot, and to my 
gun, and to tlie ground under the parrot, to let him see I would make 
it fall, I made him understand that I would shoot and kill that bird ; 
accordingly, I fired, and bade him look, and immediately he saw the 
parrot fsdl* Ho stood like one frightened again, notwithstanding all 
I had said to him ; and I found he was the more amazed because he 
did not see me put anything into the gun, but thought that there 
must be some wonderful fund of death and destruction iathat thing, 
able to kill man, beast, bird, or anything near or far off ; and the as- 
tonishment this created in him was such as could not wear off for a 
long time ; and, I believe, if I would have let him, he would have 
worshipped me and my gun. As for the gun itself, he would not so 
much as touch it for several days after ; but he would speak to it 
and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was by himself ; 
which, as I afterward learned of him, was to desire it not to kill 
him. Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed 
to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but staid 
some time ; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered away 
a good distance from the place where she fell : however, he found 
her, took her up, and brought her to me ; and as I had perceived his 
ignorance about the gun before, I took this advantage to charge the 
gun again, and not to let him see me do it, that I might be ready for 
any other mark that might present ; but nothing more offered at that 
time : so I brought Inme the kid, and the same evening I took the 
skin off, and cut it out as well as I could ; and having a pot fit for 
that purpose, I boiKid or stewed some of the flesh, and made some 
very good broth. After I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my 
man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well ; but that 
which was strangest to him was to see me eat salt with it. He made 
a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat ; and putting a little 
into his mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter 
at it, washing his mouth with fresh water after it ; on the other 
hand, I took some meat into my mouth without salt, and I pretended 



146 ROBINSON CBUSOB. 

to Rpit and sputter for want of salt, as much as he had done at the 
salt ; but it would not do ; he would never care for salt with his meat 
or in his broth ; at least not for a great while, and then but a very 
little. 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved 
to feast him the next dav by roasting a piece of the kid : this I did 
by hansjing it before the nre on a string, as 1 had seen many people do 
in England, setting two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one 
across on the top, and tying the string to the cross stick, letting the 
meat turn continually. This Friday admired verj*^ much ; but when 
he came to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how 
well he liked it, that I could not but understand him : and at last he 
told me, as well as he could, he would never eat man's flesh any 
more, which I was very glad to hear. 

The next day I set him to work to beating some, corn out, and sift- 
ing it in the manner I used to do, as I observed before ; and he soon 
understood how to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen 
what the meaning of it was, and that it was to make bread of ; for 
after that, I let him see me make my bread, and bake it too, and in 
a little time, Friday was able to do all tiie wdrk for me, as well as I 
could do it myself. 

I began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed instead 
of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a 
larger quantity of corn than I used to do ; so I marked out a larger 
piece of land, and began the fence in the same manner as before, in 
which Friday worked not only very willingly and very hard, but 
did it very cheerfully : and I told him what it was for ; that it was 
for corn to make more bread, because he was now with me, and that 
I might have enough for him and myself too. He appeared very 
sensible of that part, and let me know that he thought I had much 
more labor upon me on his account than I had for myself ; and that 
he would work the harder for me, if I would tell him what to do. 

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place. Fri- 
day began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost 
everything I had occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send 
him to, and talked a great deal to me ; so that, in short, I began now 
to have some use for my tongue again, which, indeed, I had veiy lit- 
tle occasion for before. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, 1 had 
a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself : his simple, unfeigned 
honesty appeared to me more and more every day, and I began 
really to love the creature ; and on his side, I believed he loved me 
more than it was possible for him ever to love anything before. 

I had a mj^d once to try if he had any inclination for his own 
country again ; and having taught him English so well that he could 
answer me almost any question, I asked him whether the nation that 
he belonged to never conquered in battle ? At which he smiled, and 
said, '' ^es, yes, we always fight the better ;" that is, he meant, 



BOBIIS^SOK CRUSOE. 147 

always get the better in fight ; and so we began the following dis- 
course : 

Maste7\ — You always fight the better ; how came you to be taken 
prisoner then, Friday? 

Friday. — ^My nation beat much for all that. 

Master, — How l>eat ? If your nation beat them, how came you to 
be taken ? 

Friday. — They more many than my nation, in the place where me 
was ; they take one, two, three, and me : my nation over-beat them 
in the yonder place, where me no was ; there my nation take one, 
two, great thousand. 

Mazier. — But wliy did not your side recover you from the hands 
of your enemies then ? 

Friday. — They run, one, two, three, and me, and make go in the 
canoe ; my nation have no canoe that time. 

Master, — Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with the 
men they take? Do they carry them away and eat them, as these 
did? 

Friday. — Yes, my nation eat mans too : eat all up. 

MaMer. — Where do thov carry them ? 

Friday. — Go to other place, where they think. 

Master. — ^Do they come hither ? 

Friday. — Yes, yes, they come hither ; come other else place. ' 

Master. — ^Have you been here with them ? 

Friday. — -Yes, 1 have been here (points to the N.W. side of the 
island, which, it seems, was their side). 

By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly been 
among the savages who used to come on shore on the farther part of 
the island on the same man-eating occasion he was now brought for : 
and, some time after, when I took the courage to carry him to that 
side, being the same I formerly mentioned, he presently knew the 
place, and told me he was there once, when they ate up tweuty 
men, two women, and one child : he could not tell twenty in Eng- 
lish, but he numbered them, by la3ring so many stones in a row, and 
pointing to me to tell them over. 

I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows ; that 
after this discourse I had with him, I asked him how far it was from 
our island to the shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost. 
He told me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost ; but that after 
a little way out to sea, there was a current and wind, always one 
way in the morning, the other in the afternoon. This I understood to 
be no more than the sets of the tide, as going out or coming in ; but 
I afterward understood it was occasioned by the great draught and 
-reflux of the mighty ]0veT Oroonoko, in the mouth or gulf of which 
, river, as I found afterward, our island lay ; and that this land which 
I perceived to the W. and N.W. was the great island Trinidad on 
the north point uf the mouth of the river. I asked Friday a thou* 



148 BOBINSOK CBUSOE. 

• 
sand questions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, ' 
and what nations were near : he told me all he knew, with the great- 
est openness imaginable. I asked him the names of the several na- 
tions of his sort of people, but could get no other name than Oaribs : 
from whence I easily understood that these were the Caribbees. 
which our maps place on the part of America which reaches from 
the mouth of the River Oroonoko to Guiana, and onward to St. 
Martha. He told me, that up a great way beyond the moon, that 
was, beyond the setting of the moon, which must be west from their 
country, there dwelt white, bearded men, like me, and pointed to my 
great whiskers, which I mentioned before ; and that they had killed 
much mans — that was his word : by all which I understood he meant 
the Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had been spread over the 
whole country, and were remembered by all the nations from father 
to son. 

I inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this island, and 
get among those white men ; he told me, " Yes, yes, you may go in 
two canoe." I could not understand what he meant or make 
him describe to me what he meant by two canoe, till at last, with 
great difficulty, I found he meant it must be in a large boat, as big 
as two canoes. This part of Friday's discourse 1 hegSLU to rel- 
ish very well ; and from this time I entertained some hopes that, one 
time or other, I might find an opportunity to make my escape from 
this place, and that tbis poor savage niighl be a means to help me. 

During the long time that Friday had now been with me, and that 
he began to speak to me and understand me, I was not wanting to 
lay a foundation of i-ellgious knowledge in his mind ; particularly' I 
asked him one time who made him. The poor creaturQ did not un- - 

derstand me at all, but thought I had asked him who was his father ; I 

but I took it up by another handle, and asked him who made the ^ 

sea, the ground we walked on, and the hills and woods. He told 
me, ** It was one Benamuekee, that lived beyond all ;" he could de- 
scribe nothing of this great person, but that he was very old, ** much 
older," he said, " than the sea or the land, than the moon or the 
stars." I asked him then if this old person had made all things, 
why did not all things worship him ? He looked very grave, and, 
with a pNerfect look of innocence, said, ** All things say O to him." I 
asked him, if the people who die in his country went- awtiy any- 
where? He said, ** Yes; they all went to Benammkee*" Then I 
asked him whether those they eat up went thither too ? He said 
"Yes." 

From these things, I began to instruct him in the knowledge of 
the true God : I told him that the great Maker of all thin'gs lived up 
there, pointing up toward heaven ; that he g^erned the world by 
the same power and providence by which he made it ; that he was 
omnipotent, and could do everything for us, give everything to us — 
take everything from us ; and tUus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. 



JZ^^LL. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. * 149 

^^[e listened with great attention, and received with pleasure the no- 
tion of Jesus Chrtst being sent to redeem us, and of the manner of 
making our prayers to God, and his being able to hear us, even in 
heaven. He told me one day, that if our God could hear us, up be- 
yond the sun, he must needs be a greater God tlian their Benamuc- 
kee, who lived but a little way off, and yet could not hear till they 
went up to the great mountains where he dwelt to speak to him. I 
asked him if ever he went tiiither to speak to him. He said, '* No ; 
they never went that were young men ; none went thither but the 
old men ;" whom he called their Oowokakee ; that is, as I made him 
explain it to me, their religious, or clergy ; and that they went to say 
O (so be called saying prayers), and then came back and told them 
what Benamuckee said. By this I observed that there is priestcraft 
even among the most blindeid, ignorant pagans in the world ; and the 
policy of making a secret of religion, in order to preserve the venera- 
tion of the people to the clergy, is not only to be found in the Ro- 
man, but, perhaps, among all religions in the world, even among the 
most brutish and barbarous savages. 

I endeavored to clear up this fraud to my man Friday ; and told 
him that the pretence of their old men going up to the mountains to 
say O to their god Benamuckee was a cheat ; and their bringing 
word from thence what he said was much more so ; that if they met 
with any answer, or spake with any one there, it must be with an 
evil spirit : an^ then I entered into a long discoui*se with him about 
the devil, the origin of him, his rebellion against God, his enmity to 
man, the reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark parts of the 
world to be worshipped instead of God, and as God, and the many 
stratagems he made use of to delude mankind to their ruin ; how he 
had a secret access to our passions and to our affections, and to 
adapt his snares to our inclinations, so as to cause us even to be our 
own tempters, and run upon our destruction by our own choice. 

I found it wa^ not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind 
about the devil as it was about the being of a God : nature assisted 
all my 'arguments to evidence to him even the necessity of a great 
First Cause — an overruling, governing Power — a secret directing 
Providence ; and of the equity and justice of paying homage to him 
that made us, and the like ; but there appeared nothing of this kind 
in the notion of an evil spirit ; of his origin, his being, his nature ; 
and, above all, of his inclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do 
so too ; and the poor creature puzzled me once in such a manner, by 
a question merely natural and innocent, that I scarce knew what to 
say to him. I had been talking a great deal to him of the power of 
God, his omnipotence, his aversion to sin, his being a consuming 
fire to the workers of iniquity ; how, as he had made us all, he 
could destroy us and all the world in a moment ; and he listened 
with great seriousness to me all the while. After this I had been 
telling him how the devil was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and 



150 • ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

used all his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of Provi- 
dence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the world, and the like. 
•' Well,' says Friday, *' but you say God is so strong, so great : is 
he not much strong, much miglit as the devil ?'* *' Yes, yes,*' says 
I, " Friday ; God is stronger Than the devil : God is above the devil, 
and therefore we pray to God to tread him down under our feet, and 
enable us to resist his temptations and quench his fiery darts." 
*• But," says he again, ** if God much stronger, much might as the 
wicked devil, why God no kill the devil, so make him no more do 
wicked ?" I was strangely surprised at this question ; and, after all, 
though I was now an old man, yet I was but a young doctor, and ill 
qualified for a casuist, or a bolver of difficulties ; and at first I could 
not tell what to say ; so I pretended not to hear him, and asked him 
what he said ; but he was too earnest for an answer to forget his 
question, so that he repeated it in the very same broken words as 
above. Bp'' this time I had recovered myself a little, and I said, 
** God will at last punish him severely ; he is reserved for the judg- 
ment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell with everlast- 
ing fire." This did not satisfy Friday : but he returns upon me, re- 
peating my words, ** * Reserve at last/* me no understand : but why 
not kill the devil now ? not kill great ago V" " You may as well ask 
me," said I, *' why God does not kill you or me, when we do wicked 
things here that offend him : we are preserved to repent and be par- 




by him to the last degree ; and it was a testimony to me, hpw the 
mere notions of nature, though they will guide reasonable creatures 
to the knowledge of a God, and of a worship or homage due to the 
supreme being of God, as the consequence of our nature, yet nothing 
but divine revelation can form the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of 
redemption purchased for us ; of a Mediator of the new covenant, 
and of an Intercessor at the footstool of God's throne ; I say, nothing 
but a revelation from heaven can form these in the soul ; arid that, 
therefore, the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (I mean the 
Word of God), and the Spirit of God, promised for the guide and 
sanctifler of his people, are the absolutely necessary instructors of the 
souls of men in the saving knowledge of God, and the means of sal- 
vation. 

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my 
man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of going out ; 
then sending him for something a good way off, I seriously prayed to 
God that he would enable me to instruct savingly this poor savage ; 
assisting, by his Spirit, the heart of the poor ignorant creature to re- 
ceive the light of the knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling him to 
himself, and would guide me to speak so to hun from the Woid of 
God tlmt his conscience^ might be convinced, his eyes opened, and 



BOBINSON CRUSOE. 151 

his soul saved. When he came again to me, I entered into a long 
discourse with him upon the subject of the redemption of man by 
the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine of the gospel preached 
from heaven, viz., of repentance toward God, and faith in our 
blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him as well as I could why 
our blessed Redeemer took not on him the nature of angels, but the 
seed of Abraham ; and how, for that reason, the fallen angels had no 
share in the redemption ; that he came only to the lost sheep of the 
house of Israel, and the like. 

I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the meth- 
ods I took for this poor creature's instruction, and must acknowl- 
edge, what I believed all that act upon the same principle will find, 
that in laying things open to him, I really informed and instructed 
myself in manv things that either I did not know, or had not fully 
considered before, but which occurred natunlly to my mind upon 
searching into them, for the information of this poor savage ; and I 
had more affectioiTin my inquiry after things upon this occasion than 
ever I felt before : so that, whether this poor wild wretch was the 
better for me or no, I had great reason to be thankful that ever he 
came to me ; my grief sat lighter upon me ; my habitation grew 
comfortable to me lieyond measure : and when I reflected that in this 
solitary life which I had been confined to, I had not only been moved 
to look up to Heaven myself, and to seek the hand that had brought 
me here, but was now to be made an instrument under Providence, 
to save the life, and, for aught I knew, the soul of a poor savage,^ 
and bring him to the true knowledge of religion, and of the Christian 
doctrine, that he might Jcnow Christ Jesus, in whom is life eternal ; 
I say when I reflected upon all these things, a secret joy ran through 
every part of mv soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever I was 
brought to this place, which I had so often thought the most dread- 
ful of all afiiictions that could possibly have befallen me. 

I continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my time ; 
and the conversation which employed the hours between Friday and 
me was such as meule the three years which we lived there together 
perfectly and completely happy, if any such thing as complete hap- 
piness can be found in a sublunary state. This savage was now a 
good CJhristian, a much better than I ; though I have reason to hope, 
and bless God for it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted, 
restored penitents. We had here the Word of God to read, and no 
farther on from his Spirit to instruct than if we had been in Eng- 
land. I always applied myself, in reading the Scriptures, to let him 
know, as well as I could, the meaning of what I read ; and he again, 
by his serious inquiries and questionings, made me, as I said before, 
a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge than I should ever 
have been by my own mere private reading. Another thing I cannot 
refrain from observing here also, from experience in this retired part 
of my life, viz., how infinite and inexpressible a blessing it is that 



162 BOBINSON CRUSOE. 

the knowledge of God, and of the doctrine of salvation by Christ 
Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the "Word of God, so easy to be 
received and understood, that, as the bare reading the IScripture 
made me capable of understanding enough of my duty to carry mc 
directly on to the great work of sincere repentance for my sins, and 
laying hold of a Saviour for life and salvation, to a stated reforma- 
tion in practice, and obedience to all God's commands, and this 
■without any teacher or instructor, I mean iiuman ; so the same plain 
instruction sufficiently served to the enlightening this savage creat- 
ure, and bringing him to be such a Christian as I have known few 
equal to him in my life. 

As to all the disputes, wrangling, strife, and contention which 
have happened in the world about religion, whether niceties in doc- 
trines or schemes of church government, they were all perfectly use- 
less to us, and for aught I can yet see, they have been so to the rest 
of the world. We had the sure guide to heaven, viz., the Word of 
God ; and we had, blessed be God, comfortable views of the Spirit of 
God teaching and instructing by his Word, leading us into all truth, 
and making us both willing and obedient to the Instruction of his 
Word. And I cannot see the least use that the greatest knowledge 
of the disputed points of religion, which have made such confusion 
in the world, would have been to us, if we could have obtained it ; 
but I must go on with the historical part of things, and take every 
part in its order. 

After Friday and I beciime more intimately acquainted, and that 
he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak pretty 
fluently, though in broken English, to me, I acquainted him with m^ 
own history, or at least so much of it a? related to my coming to this 
place : how I had lived there, and how long : I let him into the mys- 
tery, for such it was to him, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught 
him how to shoot. I gave liim a knife, which he was wonderfully 
delighted with ; and I made him a belt, with a frog han^ng to It. 
such as in England we wear hangers in ; and in the frog, instead of 
a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only as good a we^- 
on in some cases, but much more useful upon other occasions. 

I described to him the country of Europe, particularly England, 
which I came from ; how we lived, how we worshipped God, how we 
behaved to one another, and how we traded in ships to all parts of the 
world. I gave him an account of the wreck which I had been on 
board of, and showed him, as near as I could, the place where she 
lay : but she was all beaten in pieces before, and gone. I showed 
him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we escaped, and 
which I could not stir with my whole strength then ; but was now 
fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood 
musing a great while, and said nothing, f asked him what it was be 
studied upon. At last, says he, ''Me see such boat like come to 
place at my nation.'* I did not understand him a good while ; bul. 



ROBINSON CKUSOE. 153 

ftt last, when I had examined further into it, I understood by him 
that a boat, such as that had been, came on shore upon the country 
where he lived : that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by 
stress of weather. I presently imagined that some European ship 
must have been cast away upon their coast, and the boat might get 
loose and drive ashore ; but was so dull that I never once thought of 
men making their escape from a wreck thither, much less whence 
they might come : so I only inquired after a description of the l)oat. 

Friday described the boat to me well enough ; but brought me better 
to understand him when he added, with some warmth, ** We save the 
white mans from drown." Then I presently asked if there were any 
white mans, as he called them, in the boat. ** Yes," he said ; ** the 
boat full of white mans." I asked him how many. He told upon 
his fingers seventeen. I asked him then what became of them. He 
told me, ** They live, they dwell at my nation." 

This put new thoughts into my head ; for I presently imagined 
that these might be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away 
in the sight of my island, as I now called it ; and who, after the 
ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had 
saved themselves in their boat, and were landed upon that wild shore 
among the savages. Upon this I inquired of him more critically 
what was become of them. He assured me they lived still there ; 
that they had been there about four years ; that the savages left them 
alone, and gave them victuals to live on. I asked him how it came 
to pass .they did not kill them and eat them. He said, ** No, they 
make brother with them;" that is, as I understood him, a truce; 
and then he added, '* they no eat mans but when make the war 
fight ;" thai is to say, they never eat any men but such as come to 
fight with them, and are taken in battle. 

it was after this some considerable time, that being upon the top 
of the hill, at the east side of the island, from whence, as I have 
said, I had, in a clear day, discovered the main or continent of 
America, Friday, the weather being very serene, looks very earnestly 
toward the mainland, and, in a kind of surprise, falls a jumping 
and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some distance from 
him. I asked him what was the matter. " O joy !" says he ; ** O 
glad ! there see my country, there my nation I" I observed an extra- 
ordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his face, and his eyes 
sparkled, and his countenance discovered a strans:e eagerness, as if 
he had a mind to be in his own country again. This observation of 
mine put a great many thoughts into me, which made me, at first, 
not so easy about my new man^Friday as I was before ; and I made 
no doubt but that, if Fridav could get back to his own nation again 
ho would not only forget all his religion, but all his obligation to me, 
and would be forward enough to give his countrymen an account of 
me, and come back, perhaps, with a hundred or two of them, and 
make a feast upon me, at which he might be as merry as he used to 



154 KOBINSON CRUSOE. 

be with those of his enemies when they were taken in war. But 1 
wronged the poor honest creature very much, for which I was very 
sorry afterward. However, as my jealousy increased and held me 
some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so familiar and 
kind to him as before : in which I was certainly wrong too ; the 
honest, grateful creature having no thought about it, but what con- 
sisted with the best principles, both as a religious Christian and as a 
grateful friend ; as appeared afterward to my full satisfaction. 

While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every day 
pumping him, to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts 
which I suspected were in him ; but I found everything he said was 
so honest and so innocent that I could find nothing to nourish my 
suspicion ; and, in spile of all my uneasiness, he made me at last 
entirely his own again ; nor did he in the least perceive that I was un- 
easy, and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit. 

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being hazy at 
sea so that we could not see the continent, I called to him and said, 
** Friday, do not you wish youi-self in your own country, your own 
nation V* * Yes, he said, ** I be much O glad to be at my own na- 
tion." **What would you do there?" said I; "would you turn 
wild again, c;it men's flesh again, and be a savage, as you were be- 
fore ?" He looked full of concern, and shaking his head said, ** No, 
no, Friday tell them to live good ; tell them to pray God ; tell them 
to eat corn bread, cattle-flesh, milk ; no tat man again." ** Why, 
then," said I to him, " they will kill vou." He looked gravest that, 
and then said, " No, no, they no kill me, they willing' love learn." 
He meant by this, they would be willing to learn. He added, they 
learned much of the bearded mans that came in the boat. Then! 
asked him if he would go back to them. He smiled at that, and told 
me that he could not swim so far. I told him I would make a canoe 
for him. He told me he would go, if I would go with him. ** I 
go !" says I, ** why, they will eat me if I come there." *' No, no," 
says he, *** me make they no eat you ; me make they much love you." 
He meant, he would tell them how I had killed his enemies, and 
saved his life, and so he would make them love me. Then he told 
me, as well as he could, how kind they weie to seventeen white 
men, or bearded men, as he called them, who came on shore there in 
distress. 

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, and see if 
I could possibly join with those bearded men, who I made no doubt 
were Spaniards and Portuguese; not doubting. but, if I could, we 
might find some method to escape from thence, being upon the con- 
tinent, and a good company together, better than I could from an 
island forty miles off the shore, alone, and without help, ^o, after 
some days, I took Friday to work again, by way of discourse, and 
told him I would give him a boat to go back to his own nation ; and 
accordingly I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other side 



ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 155 

of the island, and having cleared it of water (for I always kejt it 
sunk in water), I brought it out, showed it him, and we both went 
into it. I found he was a most dexterous fellow at managing it, and 
would make it- go almost as swift again as I CQuld. So when he was 
in, I said to him, ** Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your nation ?" 
He looked very dull at my saying so ; which it seems was because he 
thought the boat too small to go so far. I then told him I had a big- 
ger ; 80 the next day I went to the place where the first boat lay 
which I had made, but which I could not get into the water. He 
said that was big enough - but then, as I had taken no care of it, aud 
it had lain two or three and twenty years there, the sun had split and 
dried it, that it was rotten. Friday told me such a boat would do 
very well, and would carry ** much enough vittle, drink, bread ** — 
that was his way of talking. 

Up(m the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of 
going over with him to the continent that I told him we would go 
and make one as big as that, and he should go home in it. He an 
swered not One word, but looked very grave and sad. I asked him 
what was the matter with him. He asked me again, ** Why you 
angry mad with Friday ? — ^what me done ?" I asked him what he 
meant. I told him I was not angry with him at all. ** No angry I" 
says he, repeating the words several times ; *' why send Friday home 
away to my nation ?'* ** Why,'* says I, *' Friday, did not you say you 
wished you were there?" ** Yes, yes,'* says he, '*wish we both 
there ; no wish Friday there, no master there.'* In a word, he 
would not think of going there. without me. ** I go there, Friday ?" 
says I ; " what shall I do there ?*' He turned very quick upon me at 
this. ** You do great deal much good," f.iys he ; ** you teach wild 
mans be good, sober, tame mans ; you tell them know God, pray 
€k)d, and live new life." ** Alas, Friday !" says I, " thou knowest 
not what thou say est ; I am but an ignorant man myself." •*' Yes, 
yes," says he. **you teachee me good, you teachee them good." 
" No, no, Friday, says I, '* you shall go without me ; leave me here 
to live by myself, as I did before. " He looked again confused at that 
word ; and running to one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he 
takes it up hastily and gives it to me. *' What must I do with 
this?" says I to him. " You take kill Friday," says he. ** What 
must I kill you for ?" said I again. He returns very quick, " What 
you send Friday away for? Take kill Friday, no send Friday 
away." This he spoke so earnestly that I saw tears stand in his 
eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost affection in him 
to me, and a firm resolution in him, that I told him then, and often 
after, that I would never send him away from me, if he was willing 
10 stay with me. 

Upon -the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled aflfection 
to me, and that nothing could part him from me, so I found all the 
foundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his 



I - 



156 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

ardmt affection to the people and his hopes of my doing them good ; 
a thing which, as I had no notion of myself, so I had not the least 
thought or intention or desire of undertaking it. But still I found a 
strong inclination to attempting my escape, founded on the supposi- 
tion gathered from the*discourse, that there weie seventeen hearded 
men there ; and therefore, without any more delay, 1 went to work 
with Friday to find out a great tree proper to fell and make a large 
periagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There were tiees 
enough in the island to have huilt a little fleet, not of periaguas or 
Ciinoes, but even of good large vessels ; but the main thing I looked 
at was to get one so near the water that we mi^ht latmch it when it 
was made, to avoid the mistake I committed at hrst. At last Friday 
pitched upon a tre^ ; for I found he knew much better than I 
what kind of wood was fittest for it ; nor can I tell to this day 
what wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it was very 
like the tree we call fustic, or between that and the Nicaragua wood, 
for it was much of the same color and smell. Friday wished to burn 
the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it for a boat, but I 
showed him how to cut it with tools ; which, after I had showed 
him how to use, he did very handily ; and in about a month's hard 
labor we finished it and made it very handsome ; especially when, 
with our axes, which I showed him how to handle, we cut and 
hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat. After this, how- 
ever, it cost us near a fortnight's ^ime to get her along, as it were 
inch by inch, upon great rollers into the water : but when she was 
in she would have carried twenty men with great ease. 

When she was in the water, though she was so bi^, it amazed me to 
see with what dexterity and how swift my man Friday could manage 
her, turn her, and paddle her along. So I asked him if he would, and 
if wc might venture over in her. " Yes," he said. ** we venture over 
in her very weU, though great blow wind.** However, I had a fur- 
ther design that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a mast 
and a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable. As to a mast, 
that was easy enough to get ; so I pitched upon a straight young 
cedar tree, which I found near the place, and which there were great 
plenty of in the island, and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and 
gave him directions how to shape and order it. But as to the sail, 
that was my particular care. I knew I had old sails, or rather 
pieces of old sails, enough ; but as I had had them now six -and- 
twenty years by me, and had not been very careful to preserve them, 
not imagining that I should ever have this kind of use for them, I did 
not doubt but thej' were all rotten ; and, indeed, most of them were 
so. However, I found two pieces, which appeared pretty good, and 
with these I went to work ; and with a great deal of pains and awk- 
ward stitching, you may be sure, for want of neeales, I at length 
made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call in England a 
Bhoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 157 

short sprit at the top, such as usually our ships' long-boats sail with, 
and such as I best knew how to manage, as it was such a one as I had 
to the boat in which I made my escape fi*om Barbary, as related in 
the first part of my story. 

I was near two months performing this last work, viz., rigging 
and fitting my mast and sails ; for I finished them very complete, 
making a small stay, and a sail, or foresail to it, to assist if we should 
turn to windward ; and what was more than ail, I fixed a rudder to 
the stern of her lo steer with. I was but a bungling shipwright, yet 
as I kiiew the usefulness and even necessity of such a thing, I ap- 
plied myself with so much pains to do it that at last I brought it to 
X)ass ; though, considering the many dull contrivances I had for it 
that failed, I think it cost me almost as much labor as making the 
boat. 

After all this was done I had my man Friday to teach ns to what 
belonged to the navigation of my boat ; for though he knew very 
well how to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing of what belonged to a 
sail and a rudder ; and was the most amazed when he saw me work 
the boat to and again in the sea by tiie rudder, and how the sail 
gibbed, and filled this way or that way, as the course we sailed 
changed ; I say, when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and 
amazed. However, with a little use, I made all these things familiar 
to him, and he became an expert sailor, except that of the compass I 
could make him understand very little. On the other hand, as there 
was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in 
those parts, there was the less occasion for a compass, seeing the 
stars were always to l»e seen by night and the shore by day, except in 
the rainy seasons, and then nobody cared to stir abroad either by 
land or sea. 

I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my captivity 
in this place ; though the three last years that I had this creature 
with me ought rather to be left qjit of the account, my habitation be- 
ing quite of another kind than in all the rest of the time. I kept the 
anniversary of my landing here with the same thankfulness to God 
for his mercies as at first ; and if I had such cause of acknowledg- 
ment at first, I had much more so now, having such additional testi- 
monies of the care of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had 
of being effectually and speedily delivered ; for I had an invincible 
impression upon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand, and 
that I should not be another year in this place. I went on, however, 
with my husbandry ; digging, planting, and fencing, as usual. I 
gathered and cured my grapes, and did every necessary thing as be- 
fore.- 

The rainy season was, in the mean time, upon me, when I. kept 
more within doors than at other times. We had stowed our new 
vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up into the creek, where, 
as I said in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship ; and 



158 ROBIKSOK CRUSOE. 

Lauling her up to tbe shore at high- water-mark, I made my man Fri- 
day dig a Utile dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep 
enough to give her water enough to float in ; and then, when the 
tide was out, we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep the 
water out ; and so she lay dry as to the tide from the sea : and to 
keep the rain off we laid a great many boughs of trees, so thick that 
she was as well thatched as a house ; and thus we waited for the 
months of November and December, in which I designed to make 
my adventure. 

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my 
design returned with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for the 
voyage. And the first thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of 
provisions, being the stores for our voyage, and intended, in a week 
or a fortnight's time, to open the dock and launch out our boat. 1 
was busy one morning upon something of this kind, when I called 
to Friday and bade him to go to the sea-shore, and see if be could find 
a turtle or tortoise, a thing which wc generally got once a week, for 
the sake of the eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not been long 
gone when he came running back, and flew over my outer wall, or 
fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the steps he set his feet 
on ; and before I had time to speak to him, he cries out to me, " 
muster ! O master ! O sorrow I O bad !" ** What's the matter, Fri- 
day?" says I. "O yonder there," says he, "one. two. three 
canoes ; one, two, three !" By this way ot speaking I concluded there 
were six ; but on inquiry I found there were but three. ** Well, Fri- 
day, '* says I, *' do not be frightened. " So I heartened him up as well 
as I could. However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly scared, 
for nothing ran in his head but that they were come to look for him, 
and would cut him in pieces and eat him ; nnd the poor fellow trem- 
bled so that I scarcely knew what to do with him. I comforted him as 
well as I could, and told him I was in as much danger as he, and 
tliat they would eat me as well as Jiim. " But," says I, ** Friday, 
we must resolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday?" "Me 
shoot," says he, " but there come many great number." ** No mat- 
ter for that," said I, again ; " our guns will fright them that we do 
not kill." So I asked him whether, if I resolved to defend him, he 
would defend me, and sta-nd by me, and do just as I bade him. He 
said, ** Me die, when you bid die, master. " So I went and fetched a 
good dram of ruin and gave him ; for I had been so good a husband 
of my rum that I had a great deal left. When he had drunk it, I 
made him take the two fowling-pieces, which we always carried, and 
loaded them with large swan-shot, as big as small pistol-bullets. 
Then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs, and five 
small bullets each ; and my two pistols 1 loaded with a brace of 
bullets each. I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my 
side, and gave Friday his hatchet. When I had thus prepared my- 
self, I took my perspective-glass and went up to the side of the hifi.

to see what I could discover ; and I found quickly by my glass that 
there were one-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes ; 
and that their whole business seemed to be the triumphant banquet 
upon these three human bodies ; a barbarous feast indeed I but noth- 
ing more than, as I had observed, was usual ^^ith them. I observed 
also that they had landed, not where they had done when Friday 
made his escape, but nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, 
and where a thick wood came almost close down to the sea. This, 
with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came 
about, filled me with such indignation that I came down again to 
Friday, and told him I was resolved to go down to Ihem and kill 
them all ; and asked him if he would stand by me. He had now got 
over his fright, and his spirits being a little raised with the dram I 
had given him, he was very cheerful, and told me, as before, he 
would dife when I bid die. 

In this fit of fury I divided the arms which I had charged, as be^ 
fore, between us ; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and 
three guns upon his shoulder, and I took one pistol and the other 
three guns myself ; and in this posture we marched out. I took a 
small bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with 
more powder and bullets ; and as to orders, I charged him to keep 
close behind mo, and not to stir, or shoot, or do anything till I bade 
him, and in the mean time not to speak a word. In this posture I 
fetched a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get 
over the creek as to get into tlie wood, so that I could come within 
shot of them before I should be discovered, which I had seen by my 
glass it was easy to do. 

While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I 
began to abate my resolution : I do not mean that I entertained any 
fear of their number, for, as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it 
is certain I was superior to them — nay, though I had been alone. 
But it occurred to my thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less 
what necessity, I was in to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack 
people who had neither done or intended me any wrong ? who, as to 
me, were innocent, and whose barbarous customs were their own dis- 
aster, being in them a token, indeed, of God's having left them, with 
the other nations of tjiat part of the world, to such stupidity, and to 
such inhuman courses, but did not call me to take upon me to be a 
judge of their actions, much less an executioner of his justice — that 
whenever he thought fit he would take the cause into his own hands, 
and by national vengeance punish them as a people for national 
crimes, but that, in the mean time, it was none of ray business — that 
it was true Friday might justify it, because he was a declared enemy 
and in a state of war with those very particular people, and it was 
lawful for him to attack them — but I could not say the same with 
regard to myself. These things were so warmly pressed upon my 
thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I would only go and

place myself Dear them that I might observe their, barbarous feast, 
and tliat I would act then as God should direct ; but that unless 
something offereii that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I 
would not meddle with them. 

With this resolution I entered the wood, and, with all possible 
wariness and silence, Friday following close at my heels, I marched 
till I came to the skirt of the wood on the side which was next to 
them, onlv that one comer of the wood lay between me and them. 
Here I called softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree which 
was just at the corner of the wood, 1 bade him go to the tree, and 
bring me word if he could see there plainly what they were doing. 
He aid so, and came immediately back to me, and told me they might 
be plainly viewed there — that they were all about their fire eating the 
flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay bound upon the 
sand a little from them, whom he sai'd they would kill next ; and this 
fii:ed the very soul within me. He told me it was not one of their 
nation, but one of the bearded men he had told me of, that came to 
their country in the boat. I was filled with horror at the* very nam- 
ing of the white, bearded man ; and going to the tree, I saw plainly 
by my glass a while man. who~4ay upon the beach of the sea with 
his hands and his feet tied with flags, or things like rushes, and that 
he was a European, and had clothes on. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about fifty- 
yards nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by going a 
little way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then 
I should be within half a shot of them ; so I withheld my passion, 
though I was indeed enraged to the highest degree ; and going back 
about twenty paces, I got behind some bashes, which held ail the 
way till I came to the other tree, and then came to a little rising 
ground, which gave me a full view of them at the distance of about 
eighty yards. 

1 had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful 
wretches sat upon the ground, all close huddled together, and had 
just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him 
perhaps limb by limb to their fire, and thev were stooping down to 
untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Friday. ** Now, Friday,'* 
said I, '* do as I bid thee." Friday said he would. "Then, 
Friday," says I, "do exactly as you see me do ; fail in nothing." 
So I set down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon the 
ground, and Friday did the like by his, and with the other musket I 
took my aim at the savages, bidding him to do the like ; then asking 
him if he was ready, he said, ** Yes." '* Then fire at them," said I ; 
and at the same moment I fired also. 

Friday took his aim so much better than I that on the side that he 
shot he killed two of them and wounded three more ; and on my 
side I killed one, and wounded two. They were, you may be sore, 
in a dreadful consternation ; and all of them that were not hurt 



BOBINSOl^ CRUSOE. IGl 

jumped upon their feet, but did not immediately know which way lo 
run. or which way to look, for they knew not from whence their 
destruction came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me, that, as I 
had bid him, he might olierve what I did ; so, as soon as the first 
shot waj made, I threw down the piece and took up the fowling- 
piece, and Friday did the like ; he saw me cock and present ; he did 
the same again. ** Are you ready, Friday?** said I. " Yes,'* says 
he. " Let By then," says I, " in the name of God I" and with that 
I fired again among the amazed wretches, and so did Friday : and as 
our pieces were now loaded with what I call swan-shot, or small 
pistol-bullets, we found only two drop ; but so many were wounded 
that they ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all 
bloody, and most of them miserably wounded ; whereof three more 
fell quickly after, though not quite dead. 

"Now, Friday.*' says 1, laying down the discharged pieces, and 
taking up the musket which was yet loaded, "follow me,'* which 
he did with a great deal of courage ; upon which I ruslied out of the 
wood and showed myself, and Fndav close at my fool. As soon as 
I perceived they saw me^ I shouted as loud as I could, and bade 
Friday do so too, and running as fast as I could, which by the way 
was not very fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I made directly 
toward the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the beach or 
rfiore, between the place where they sat and the sea. The two 
butchers who were just going to work with him had left him at the 
surprise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible fright to the sea-side, 
and had jumped 4nto a canoe, and three more of the^ rest made the 
same way. 1 turned to Friday, and bade him step forward and fire 
at them ; he understood me immediately, and running about forty 
yards, to be nearer them, he shot at them ; and I thought he ha& 
killed them all, for I saw them all fall of a heap into the boat, though 
I saw two of them up again quickly ; however, he killed two of 
them, and wounded the third so that he lay down in the bottom of 
the boat as if he had been dead. 

While my man» Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife and 
cut the fiags that bound the poor victim ; and loosing his hands and 
feet, I lifted him up, and asked him, in the Portuguese tongue, what 
he was. He answered in Latin, Christianus ; but was so weak and 
faint that he could scarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of 
my pocket and gave it him, making signs that he should drink, 
which he did ; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he ate. Then 
I asked him what countryman he was ; and he said Espagniole ; and 
being a little recovered, let me know, by all the signs he could possi- 
bly make, how mucn he was in my debt for his deliverance. 
*' Seignior," said I, with as much Spanish as I could make up, " we 
will talk afterward, but we mast light now : if you have any strength 
left, take this pistol and sword and layabout you." He took them 
yery thankfully ; and no sooner had he the arms in his hands, but, 
R. c— 6 



162 ROBINSOir CRUSOE. 

as if they had put new vigor into him, he flew upon his murderers 
like a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant ; for the 
truth is, as the wliole was a surprise to, them, so the poor creatures 
were so much frightened with the noise of our pieces that tliey fell 
down for mere amazement and fear, and had no more power to at- 
tempt their own escape than their flesh had to resist our shot : and 
that was the case of those five that Friday shot at in the boat ; for 
as three of them fell with the hurt 4,hey received, so the other two 
fell with the fright. 

I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being willing to 
keep my charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol 
and sword : so I called to Friday and bade him run up to the tree 
from whence we first fired and fetch the arms which lay there that 
had been discharged, which he did with great swiftness ; and then 
giving him my musket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again, 
and bade them come to me when they wanted. While I was loading^ 
these pieces, there happened a fierce engagement between the Span- 
iard and one of the savages, who made at nim with one of their great 
wooden sworda. the weapon that was to have killed him before, if I 
had not prevented it. The Spaniard, who was as bold and brave as 
could be imagined, though weak, had fought the Indian a good 
while, and had cut two great wounds on his head ; but the savage, 
being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him 
down, being faint, and was wringing my sword out of his hand ; 
when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting the sword, 
drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage through the body, 
and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running to help 
him, could come near him. 

Friday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches, 
with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet ; and with that he dis- 
patched those three who, as I said before, were wounded at first, 
and fallen, and all the rest he could come up with : and the Spaniard 
coming to me for a gun, I gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with 
which he pursued twp of the savages, and wounded them both ; but, 
as he was not able to run, they both got from him into ^le wood, 
where Friday pursued them and killed one of them, but the other was 
too nimble for him ; and though he was wounded, yet had plunged 
himself into the sea, and swam with all his might off to those two who 
were left in the canoe ; which three in the canoe, with one wounded, 
that we knew not whether he died or no, were all that escaped our 
hands of one-and-twenty. The account of the whole is as follows : 
three killed at our first shot from the tree ; two killed at the next 
shot ; two killed by Friday in the boat ; two killed by Friday of those 
at first wounded ; one killed by Friday in the wood ; three killed by 
the Spaniard ; four killed, being found dropped here and there, of the 
wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of them ; four escaped in 
the boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead — twenty-one in all. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 163 

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gunshot, 
and though Friday made two or three shots at them, I did not find 
that he hit any of them. Friday would fain have liad me take one 
of tlieir canoes and pursue them ; and, indeed, I was very anxious 
about their escape, lest, carrying the news home to their people, they 
should come back perhaps with two or three hundred of the canoes, 
and devour us by mere jpultitude ; so I consented to pursue them by ' 
sea, and running to one of their canoes, I jumped in and bade Friday 
follow me ; but when I was in the canoe, I was surprised to find 
another poor creature lie there, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard 
was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what 
was the matter ; for he had not been able to look up over the side of 
tlie boat, he was tied so hard neck and heels, and had been tied so 
long, that he had really but little life in him. 

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes which they had 
bound him with, and would have helped him up ; but he could not 
stand or speak, but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems, still, 
that he was only unbound in order to be killed. When Friday came 
to him I bade him speak to him. and tell him of his deliverance ; 
and pulling out my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a drain ; 
which, with the news of his being delivered, revived him, and he sat 
up in the boat. But when Friday came to hear him speak, and look 
in his face, it would have moved any one to teal's to have seen how 
Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hal- 
looed, jumped about, danced, sung ; then cried again, wrung his 
hands, beat his own face and head ; and then sung and jumped 
about again like a distracted creature. It was a good while before I 
could make him spe^k to me, or tell me what was the matter ; but 
when he came a little to himself he told me that it was his fatlicr. 

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what ec- 
stasy and filial affection had worked in this poor savage at the sight 
of his father, and of his being delivered from death ; nor, indeed, 
can I describe half the extravagances of his affection after this ; for 
he went into the boat and out of the boat a great many times : when 
he went in to him, lie would sit down by him, open his breast, and 
hold his father's head close to his bosom for many minutes together, 
to nourish it ; then he took his arms and ankles, which were numbed 
and stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his 
hands ; and I, perceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out 
of my bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal of good. 

This affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other 
savages, who were now almost out of sight : and it was happy for 
us that we did not, for it blew so hard within two hours after, and 
l>efore they could be got a quarter of their way, and continued blow- 
ing so hard all night, and that from the north-west, which was against 
them, that I could not suppose their boat could Uve, or that they 
ever reached their own coast.

164 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

But to return to Friday : he was so busy about his father, that I 
could Qot find in my heart to take him off for some time ; but af lor I 
thought he could leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came 
jumping and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme ; Ihen I 
asked him if he had given his father any bread. He shook his head, 
and said, " None ; ugly do^ eat all up self.** I then gave him a cake 
of bread, out of a litUe pouch I carried on purpose ; 1 also gave him 
a dram for himself j; but he would not taste it, but carried It .to Jiis 
father. I had in my pocket two or three bunches of raisins ; so I 
gave him a handful of them for his father. He had no sooner given 
his father these raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat and run 
away as if he had been bewitched, for he was the swiftest fellow on 
his teet that ever I saw : I say, he ran at such a rate that he was out 
of sight, as it were, in an instant ; and though I called, and hallooed 
out too, after him, it was all one — ^away he went ; and in a quarter 
of an hour I saw him come back again, though not so fast as he 
went ; and as he came nearer, I found his pace slacker, because he 
had something in his hand. When he came up to me, I found he 
had been quite home for an earthen jug or pot, to bring his father 
some fresh water, and that he had got two more cakes or loaves of 
bread : the bread he gave me, but the water he carried to his father ; 
however, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little of it. The water 
revived his father more than all the rum or spirits I had given him, 
for he was fainting with thirst. 

When his father had drank, I called to him to know if there was 
any water left : he said, *' Yes ;'* and I bade him give it to the poor 
Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his father ; and I sent 
one of the cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard too, who was 
indeed very weak, and was reposing himself upon a green place under 
the shade of a tree ; and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very 
much swelled with the rude bandage he had been- tied with. When 
I saw that upon Friday's coming to him with the water, he sat up 
and drank, and took the bread^and began to eat, I went to him and 
gave him a handful of raisins ; he looked up in my face with all the 
tokens of gratitude and thanlifulness that could appear in any coun- 
tenance ; but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so everted him- 
self in the fight, that he could not stand up upon his feet • he tried 
to do it two or three times, but was really not able, his ankles were 
m swelled and so painful to him ; .so I bade him sit still, and caused 
Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum, as he had done 
his father's. 

I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, or 
perhaps less, all the while he was here, turn his head about, to see if 
his father was in the same place and posture as he left him sitting ; 
and at last he found he was not to be seen ; at which he started up, 
and, without speaking a word, flew with that swiftness to him that 
one could scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went : 




ROBINSON CRUSOE. 165 

but when he came, be only found he liad laid himself down to ease 
bis limbs ; so Friday came back to me presently ; and then I spoke 
to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him 
to the boat, and then he should carry him to our dwelling:, where I 
would take care of him. But Friday, a lusty, strong fellow, took 
the Spaniard upon his back and carried him away to the boat, and 
set him down softly upon the side or ^nnel of the canoe, with his 
feet in the inside of it ; and then liftmg him quite in, he set him 
close to his father ; and presently stepping out again, launched the 
boat off, and pnddled it along the shore faster than I could walk, 
though the wind blew pretty hard too ; so he brought them both 
safe mto our creek, and leaving them m the boat, ran away to fetch 
the other canoe. As he passed me I spoke to him and asked him 
whither he went. He told me, '* Go fetch more boat :** so away he 
went like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like him ; and 
he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by 
land ; so he wafted me over, and then went to help our new guests 
out of the boat, which he did ; but they were neither of them able to 
walk ; so that poor Friday knew not what to do. 

To remedy this, 1 went to work in my thought, and calling to 
Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to me, I soon 
made a kind of hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I car- 
ried them both up together upon it between us. 

But when we got them to the outside of our wall, or fortification, 
we were at a worse loss than before, for it wa^ impossible to get them 
over, and I wjis resolved not to break it down ; so I set to work again, 
and Friday and I, in alnnit two hours* time, made a very handsome 
tent, covered with old sails, and above that with'boughs of trees, 
being in the space without our outward fence, and between that ^nd 
the grove of voung wood which I had planted ; and here we made 
them two beds of such things as I had ; viz., of good rice straw, with 
blankets laid upon it, to lie on, and another to cover them, on each 
bed. 

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in sub- 
jects ; and it was a merry reflection, which I frequently made, how 
like a king I looked. First of all, the whole country was my own 
property, so that I had an undoubted right of dominion. Secondly, 
my people were perfectly subjected : I was absolutely lord and law- 
giver : they all owed their lives to me, and were ready to lay down 
their lives, if there had been occasion for it, for me. It was remark- 
able, too, I had but three subjects, and they were of three different 
religions : my man Friday was a Protestant, his father was a Pagan 
and a cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Papist. However, I allowed 
liberty of conscience throughout my dominions. But this is by the 
wav. 

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners, and 
given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon. I began to think 



166 ROBINSON^ CRUSOE. 

of making some provision for them : and the first thing I did, I or- 
dered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of 
my particular flock, to be killed ; when I cut oflf the hinder quarter, 
and chopping it into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and 
stewing, and made them a rery good dish, I assure you, of flesh and 
broth ; and as I cooked it without doors, fori made no fire within my 
inner wall, so I carried it all into the new tent, and having set a table 
there for them, I sat down, and ate my own dinner also with them, and, 
as well as I could, cheered them and encourao^ed them. Friday was 
my interpreter, especially to his father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard 
too ; for the Spaniard spoke the language of the savages pretty well. 

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take one 
of the canoes and go and fetch our muskets and otiier firearmi^ 
which, for want of time, we had left upon the place of buttle ; and 
the next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the 
savages, which lay open to the sun, and woiild presently be offensive. 
I also ordered him to burv the horrid remains of their barbarous 
feast, which I could not think of doing myself : nay, I could not 
bear to see them, if I went that way ; all which he punctually per- 
formed, and effaced the very appearance of the savages being there ; 
BO that when I went again I could scarce know where it was, other- 
wise than by the corner of the wood pointing to the place. 

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new 
subjects ; and first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he 
thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we 
might expect a return of them, with- a power too great for us to re- 
sist. His first opinion was that the savages in the boat never could 
live out the storm which blew that night they went off, but must of 
necessity be drowned or driven south to those other shores, where 
they were as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if they 
were cast away ; but as to what they would do if they came safe on 
shore, he said he knew not ; but it was his opinion that they were 
so dreadfully frightened with the manner of their being attacked, the 
noise, and the fire, that he believed they would tell the people they 
were all killed by thunder and lightning, not by the hand of man ; 
and that the two which appeared, viz., Friday and I, were two heav- 
enly spirits, 6r furies, come down to destroy them, and not men 
with weapons. This, he said, he knew ; because he heard them all 
cry out so, in their language, one to another ; for it was impossible 
for them to conceive t&t a man could dart fire and speak thunder, 
and kill at a distance without lifting up the hand, as was done now ; 
and this old savage was in the right ; tor, as I understood since, by 
other hands, the savages never attempted to go over to the island 
afterward, they were so terrified with the accounts given by those 
four men (for it seems they did escape the sea), that they believed 
whoever went to that enchanted island would be destroyed with fire 
from the gods. This, however, I knew not ; and therefore was 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 167 

under continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept always 
upon my guard, with all my army ; for, as there were now four of 
us, I would have ventured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the 
open iield, at any time. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of 
their coming wore olf ; and I began to take my former thoughts of 
a voyage to the main into consideration ; being likewise assured, by 
Friday's father, that I might depend upon good usage from their 
nation, on his account, if I would go. But my thoughts were a little 
suspended when I had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and 
when I understood that there were sixteen more of his countrymen 
and Portuguese, who, having been cast away and made their escape 
to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with the savages, but were 
very sore put to it for necessaries, and, indeed, for life. I asked 
him all the particulars of their voyage, and found they were a Spanish 
ship, bound from the Rio de la I^iata to the Havana, being directed 
to leave their loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver, and 
to bring back what European goods they could meet with there ; that 
they had five Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took out of 
another wreck ; that five of their own men were drowned, when first 
ti^e ship was lost, and that these escaped through infinite dangers 
and hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal coast, 
where they expected to have been devoured every moment. He told 
me they had some arms with them, but they were perfectly use- 
less, for that they had neither powder nor ball, the washing of the 
sea haying spoiled all their powder but a little, which they used at 
their fii^t landing to provide themselves some food. 

I asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if 
they had formed any design of making their escape. He said they 
had many consultations about it ; but that, having neither vessel, 
nor tools to build one, nor provisions of any kind, their councils al- 
ways ended in tears and despair. I asked him how he thought they 
would receive a proposal from me, which might tend toward an 
escape ; and whether, if they were ail here, it might not be done. I 
told him with freedom, I feared mostly their treachery and ill usage 
of me, if I put my life in their hands ; for that gratitude was no in- 
herent virtue in the nature of man, nor did men always square their 
dealings by the obligations they had received, so much as they did 
by the advantages they expected. I told him it would be very hard 
that I should be the instrument of their deliverance, and that they 
should afterward make me their prisoner in New Spain, where an 
Englishman was certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity, or 
what accident soever brought him thither ; and that I had rather be 
delivered up to the savages and be devoured alive than fall into the 
merciless claws of the priests and be carried into the Inquisition. I 
added that, otherwise, I was persuaded, if they were all here, we 
might, with so many hands, build a bark large enough to carry us all 



.x^»<— a 



168 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



'away, either to the Brazils southward, or to the islands or Spanish 
v^oast northward; but that if, in requital, they should, when I had 
put weapons into their hands, carry me by force among their own 
people, I might be ill used for my kindness to them, and make my 
case worse than it was before. 

He answered, with a great deal of candor and ingenuousness, that 
their condition was so miserable, and that they were so sensibre of it, 
that he believed they would abhor the thought of using any man un- 
kindly that should contribute to their deliverance ; and that, if I 
pleased, he would go to them, with the old man, and discourse with 
,them about it, and return again, and bring me their answer ; that he 
would make conditions with them upon their solemn oath, that they 
should be absolutely under my direction, as their commander and 
captain ; and they should swear upon the holy sacraments and gos- 
pel to be true to me, and go to such Christian country as I should 
agree to, and no other ; and to be dii^ected wholly and absolutely by 
my orders, till they were landed safely in such country as I intended ; 
and that he would bring a contract from them, unaer their hands, 
for that purpose. Then he told me he would first swear to me him- 
self, that he would never stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave 
him orders ; and that he would take my side to the last drop of his 
blood, if there should happen the least breach of faith among his 
countrymen. He told me they were ajl of them very civil, honest 
men, and they were under the greatest distress imaginable, havi|:ig 
neither weapons, nor clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and dis- 
cretion of the savages ; out of all hopes of ever returning to their own 
country ; and that he was sure, if I would undertake their relief, they 
would live and die by me. 
^W^'' «H»Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if 
possible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to 'them 
to treat. But when we had got all things in readiness to go, the 
Spaniard himself started an objection, which had so much prudehee 
in it on one hand, and so much sincerity on the other hand, that I 
could not but be very well satisfied in it ; and, by his advice, put off 
the deliverance of his comrades for at least half a year. The case 
was thus : he had been with us now about a month, during which 
time I had let him see in what manner I had provided, with the as- 
sistance of Providence, for my support ; and he saw evidently what 
stock of corn and rice I had laid up ; which, though it was more 
than sufiicient for myself, yet it was not sufiicient, without good 
husbandry, for my family, now it was increased to four ; but much 
less would it be sufficient if his countrymen, who were, as he said, 
sixteen, still alive, should come over ; and least of all would it be 
sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage 
to any of the Christian colonies of America ; so he told me he thought 
it would be more advisable to let him and the other two dig and cul- 
tivate some more land, as much as I could spare seed to sow, and

that we should wait another harvest, that we might have a supply of 
cora for his countrymen, when they should come ; for want might 
be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to think themselves deliv- 
ered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into another. ** You 
know," says he, ** the children of Israel, though they rejoiced at first 
for their Ixiing delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against God 
himself, that delivered them, when they came to want bread in the 
wilderness." 

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I could 
not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I was sat- 
isfied with his fidelity ; so we fell to digging, all four of us, as well 
as the wooden tools we were furnished with permitted ; and, in 
about a month's time, by tbe end of which it was seed-time, we had 

fot as much land cured and trimmed up, as we sowed two-and-twenty 
ushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all 
the seed we had to spare ; indeed, we left ourselves barely sufficient 
for our own food for the six months that we had to expect our crop ; 
that is, to say, reckoning from the time we set our seed aside for 
sowing ; for it is not to be supposed it is six months in the ground 
in that country. 

Having now society enough, and our number being sufficient to 
put us out of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless their num- 
ber had been very great, we went freely all over the island, whenever 
we found occasion ; and as we had our escape or deliverance upon 
our thoughts, it was impossible, at least for me, to have the means of 
it out of mine. For this purpose, I marked out several trees, which 
I thought fit for our work, and I set Friday and his father to cut 
them down ; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted 
my thoughts on that affair, to oversee and direct their work. ,1 
showed them with what indefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree 
into single planks, and I caused them to do the like, till they had 
made about a dozen large planks of good oak, near two feet broad, 
thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to four inches thick : what 
prodigious labor it took up, any one may imagine. 

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock of tame 
goats as much as I could ; and for this purpose I made Friday and 
the Spaniard go out one day, and myself with Friday the next day 
(for we took our turns), and by this means we got about twenty 
young kids to breed up with the rest ; for whenever we shot the 
dam we saved the kids, and added them to our fiock. But, above 
all, the season for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a pro- 
digious quantity to be hung up in the sun that I believe, had we 
been at Alicant, where the raisins of the sun are cured, we could 
have filled ^ixty or eighty barrels ; and these, with our bread, formed 
a great part of our food — very good living, too, I assure you, for they 
are exceeding nourishing. 

It was^uow harvest, and our crop in good order : it was not the 



:il.

most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was 
enough to answer our end ; for, from twenty-two bushels of barley 
we brought in and thrashed out above two hundred and twenty 
bushels ; and the like in proportion of the rice ; which was store 
enough for our food to the next harvest, though all the sixteen Span- 
iards had been on shore with me ; or, if we had been ready for a 
voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled our ship to have 
carried us to any part of the world — that is to say, any part of Amer- 
ica. When we had thus housed and secured our magazine of corn, 
we fell to work to make more wlckerware, viz., ^reat baskets, in 
which we kept it ; and llie Spaniard was very handy and dexterous 
at ihis part, and often blamed me that I did not make some things 
for defence of this kind of work ; but I saw no need of it. * 

And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I ex- 
pected, I gasre the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what 
he could do with those he had left behind him there. I gave him a 
strict charge not to bring any man with him who would not first 
swear, in the presence of himself and the old savage, that he would 
no way injure, tight with, or attack the person he should find in the 
island, who was so kind as to send for them in order to their deliver- 
ance ; but that they would stand by him and defend him against 
all 9uch attempts, and wherever they went, would be entirely under 
and subjected to liis command ; and that this should be put in writ- 
ing and signed in their hands. How they were to have done this, 
when I knew they hail neither pen nor ink, was a question which we 
never asked. Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old 
savage, the father of Fiiday, went away in one of the canoes which 
they might be said to have come in, or rather were brought in, when 
they came as prisoners to be devoured by the savages. I gave each 
of them a musket, with a firelock on it, and about eight charges of 
powder and ball, charging them to be very good husbands of both, 
and not to use either of them but upon urgent occasions. 

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me, in 
view of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years and some days. 
I gave them provisions of bread and of dried grapes, sufllcient lor 
themselves for many days, and sutflcient for all the Spaniards for 
about eight days' time ; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them 
go. agreeing with them about a signal they should hang out at their 
return, by which I should know them again, when they came back, 
at a distance, before they came on shore. They went away, with a 
fair gale, on the day that the moon was at full, by my account in the 
month of October ; but as for an exact reckoning of days, after I liad 
once lost it, I could never recover it again ; nor had I kept even the 
number of years so punctually as to be sure I was right ^ though, as 
it proved, when I afterward examined my account, I found I had 
kept a true reckoning of years. 

it was DO less than eight days I had waited f&r them. When a

Strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has 
not, perhaps, l)een heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my 
hutch one morning, when my man Friday came running in to me, and 
called aloud, ** Mtister, master, they are come, they are come !'* I 
jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went out as soon as I could 

fet my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by the way, was 
y this time grown to be a very thick wood ; I say, regardless of 
danger, I went out without my arms, which was not my custom to 
do : but I was surprised, when, turning my eyes to the sea, I pres- 
ently saw a boat at about a league and a half distance, standing in 
for the shore, with a shoulder -oi-mutton sail, as they call it, and the 
wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in : also I observed, pres- 
ently, that they did not come from that side which the shore lay on, 
but from the southernmost end of the island. Upon this I called 
Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these were not the people we 
looked for, and that we might not know yet whether they were 
friends or enemies. In the next place, I went in to fetch my per- 
spective-glass, to see what I could make of them ; and haviug taken 
the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the hill, as I used to do 
"when I was apprehensive of anything, and to take ray view the 
plainer, without being discovered. I had scarce set my foot upon 
the hill, when my eye plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at 
about two leagues and a halt distance from me, 8.8.E., but not above 
a league and a half from the shore. By my observation, it appeared 
plainly to be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an English 
long-boat. 

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of seeing 
a ship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned by my own 
countrymen, and consequeutly friends, was such as I cannot de- 
scribe ; but yet I had some secret doubts hung about me— I cannot 
tell from whence they came — bidding me keep upon my guard. 
In the first place, it occurred to me to consider what business an 
English ship could have in that part of the world, since it was not the 
way to or from any part of the world where the English had any traffic; 
and I knew there had been no storms to drive them in there, in dis- 
tress ; and that if they were reallv English it was most probable 
that they were here upon no good design : and that I had better con- 
tinue as I was than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers. 

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger which 
sometimes are given hira when he may think there is no possibility 
of its being rea*. That such hints and notices are given us, I believe 
few that have made any observations of things can deny ; that they 
are certain discoveries of an invisible world, and a converse of 
spirits, we cannot doubt ; and if the tendency of them seems to be 
to warn us of danger, why should we not suppose they are from 
some friendly agent (whether supreme, or inferior and subordinate, 
is not the question), and that they are given for our good ? 



172 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

The present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of this 
reasoning ; for had I not been made cautious by this secret admoni- 
tion, come it from whence it will, I bad been undone inevitably, and 
in a far worse condition than before, as you will see presently. I 
had not kept myself long in this posture till I saw the boat draw 
near the shore, as if they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for tlie con- 
venience of landing ; however, as they did not come quite far enough, 
they did not see the little inlet where 1 formerly landed my rafts, but 
ran their boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from 
me ; which was very happy for me ; for otherwise Ihey would have 
lauded just at my door, as I may say, and would soon have beaten 
me out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered me of all I had. 
When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied they were English- 
men, at least most of them ; one or two I thought ^were Dutch, but 
it did not prove so ; there were in all eleven men, whereof three of 
them I found were unarmed, and, as I thought, bound ; and when- 
the first four or five of them were jumped on shore ihey took those 
three out of the boat as prisoners ; one of the three I could perceive 
using the most passionate gestures of entreaty, afiliction, and despair, 
even to a kind of extravagance ; the other two, I could perceive, 
lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared concerned, indeed, 
but not to such a degree as the first. I was perfectly confounded at 
the sight, and knew not what the meaning of it should be. Friday 
called out to me in English, as well as he could. *' Oh, master ! 
you see English mans eat prisoner as well as savage mans. '* ** Why, 
Friday,'* says I, ** do you think they are going to eat them, then r" 
"Yes,'* says Friday, "they will eat them.'^ "No, no," says I, 
" Friday ; I am afraid they will murder them, indeed ; but you may 
be sure they will not eat them.'* 

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but 
stood trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every moment 
when the three prisoners should be killed ; nay, once I saw one of 
the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the seamen call it, 
or sword, to strike one of the poor men ; and I expected to see him 
fall every moment ; at which all the blood in my body seemed to run 
chill in my veins. I wished heartily now for the Spaniard, and the 
savage that was gone with him, or that I had any way to have come 
undiscovered within shot of them, that I might have secured the 
three men, for I saw no firearms they had among them ; but it fell 
out to my mind another way. After I had observed the outrageous 
usage of the three men by the insolent seamen, I observed the fellows 
run scattering about the island, as if they wanted to see the country. 
I observed that the three other men had liberty to go also where they 
pleased ; but they sat down all three upon the ground, very pensive, 
and looked like men in despair. This put me in mind of the first 
time when I came on shore and began to look about me ; how 1 gave 
myself over for lost ; how wildly 1 looked round me ; what dreadful 



- ^

apprehensions I had ; and how I lodged in the tree all night, for fear 
01 being devoured by wild beasts. As I knew nothing, that night, of 
lh§ supply I was to receive by the providential driving of the sliip 
nearer the land by the storms and tide, by which I have since been 
so long nourished and supported, so these Jthree poor desolate men 
knew nothing how certain of deliverance arid supply they were, how 
near it was to them, and how effectual! v and really they were in a 
condiiion of safety, at the same time that they thought themselves lost 
and their case desperate. So little do we see before us in the world, 
and so much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the great 
Maker of the world, that he does not leave his creatures so absolutely 
destitute but that, in the worst circumstances, they have always 
something to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer deliverance 
than they imagine ; nay, are even brought to their deliverance by the 
means by which they seem to be brought to their destruction. 

It was just at high water when these people came on shore ; and 
while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in, 
they had carelessly staid till the tide was spent, and the water was 
ebbed considerably away, leaving theij boat aground. They had left 
two men in the boat, who. as I found afterward, having drunk a liltlo 
too much brandy, fell asleep ; however, one of them, waking a little 
sooner than the other, and finding the boat too fast aground for him 
to stir it, hallooed out for the rest, who were straggling about ; upon 
which they all soon came to the boat : but it was past all their stren2;th 
to launch her, the boat being very heavy and the shore on that side 
being a soft oozy sand, almost like a quicksand. In this condition, 
like true seamen, who are. perhaps, the Mast of all mankind given to 
forethought, they gave it over, and away they strolled about the 
country again ; and I heard one of them say aloud to another, calling 
them off from the boat, ** Why, let her alone. Jack, can't you ? she'll 
float next tide ;" by which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry 
of what countrymen they were. All this while I kept myself very 
close, not once daring to stir out of mj' castle any farther than to 
my place of observation, near the top of the hill i and very glad I 
was to think how well it was fortified. I knew it was no less than 
ten hours before the boat could float again, and by that time it would 
be dark, and I might be at more liberty to see their motions, and to 
hear their discourse, if they had any. In the mean time I fitted my- 
self up for a battle, as before, though with more caution, knowing I 
had to do with another kind of enemy than I had at first. I ordered 
Friday also, whom I had made an excellent marksman with his gun, 
to load himself with arms. I took myself two fowling pieces, and I 
gave him three muskets. My figure, indeed, was very fierce ; I had 
my formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I have men- 
tioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my bell, and a gun 
upon each shoulder. 

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



till it was dark ; but about two o'clock, being the heat of the day, I 
found that they were all gone strap:gling into the woods, and, as I 
thought, laid down to sleep. The three poor distressed men, too anx- 
ious for their condition to get any sleep, had, however, sat down 
under the belter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from 
me and, as I thought, oift of sight of any of the rest. Upon this I 
resolved to discover myself to them, and K am something of tbeir con- 
dition ; immediately I marched as above, uiy man Friday at a good 
distance behind me, as formidable for his aims as I, but not mnkiug 
quite so staring a spectre-like iigure as I did. I came as nenr thenx 
undiscovered as I could, and thenT before any of them saw me, I called 
aloud to them in Spanish, ** "What are ye, gentlemen ?" They started 
up at the noise, but were ten times more confounded when they saw 
me and the uncouth figure that I made. They made no answer at 
all, but I thought I perceived them iust going to fly from me when 
I spoke to them in English. *' Gentlemen,'* said I, *' do not be sur- 
prised at me ; perhaps you may have a friend near, when you did 
not expect it.** ** He must be sent directly from heaven then." said 
one of them very gravely to me. and pulhng off his hat at the same 
time to me ; "for our conditioti is past the help of man. " ** All help 
is from heaven, sir,** said I : ** but can you put a stranger in the 
way to help you ? for you seem to be in some great distress. I saw 
you when you landed ; and when you seemed to make application to 
the brutes that came with you, I saw one of them lift up his sword 
to kill you.'* 

The poor man, with tears running down his face, and trembling, 
looking like one astonished, returned, ** Am I talking to God or 
man? Is it a real man or an angel?" ** Be in no fear about that, 
sir,*' said I ; ** if God had sent an angel to relieve you he would have 
come better clothed, and armed after another manner than you aee 
me ; pray lay aside youi- fears ; I am a man, an Englishman, and 
disposed to assist you ; you see I have one servant only ; we have 
arms and ammunition ; tell us freely, can we serve you ? What is 
your case?" ** Our case, sir,'* said he, "is too long to tell you, 
while our murderers are so near us ; but, in short, sir, I was com- 
mander of that ship ; niy men have mutinied against me ; they have 
been hardly prevailed on not to murder me, and, at last, have set me 
on shore in this desolate place, with these two men with me— one 
my mate, the other a passenger — where we expected to perish, believ- 
ing the place to be uninhabited, and know not yet what to think of 
it.** "Where are these brutes, your enemies?** said I ; "do you 
know where they are gone ?'* " There they lie, sir,*' said he, pomt* 
ing to a thicket of trees ; " my heart trembles for fear they have seen 
us, and heard you speak ; if they have, they will certainly murder us 
all.** "Have Ihey any firearms?" said I. He answered, "they 
had only two pieces, one of which they left in the boat.** " Well 
then," said I, " leave the rest to me ; I see they are all asleep ; it is 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



175 



an easy thing to kill them all ; but shall we rather take them {Prison- 
ers?" He told me there were two desperate villains among them 
that it was scarce safe to show any mercy to ; bat if they were se- 
cured, he believed all the rest would return to their duty. I asked 
him which they were. He told me he could not at that distance dis- 
tinguish them, but he would obey my orders in anything I would 
direct. ** Well," says I, ** let us retreat out of their view or hearing, 
lest they awake, and we will resolve further.** So they willingly 
went back with me, till the woods covered us from them. 

** Look you, sir," said I, ** if I venture upon your dehverance, are 
you willing to make two conditions with me?" He anticipated my 
proposals by telling me that both he and the ship, if recovered, should 
be wholly clirected and commanded by me in everything ; and if the 
ship was not recovered, he would live and die with me in what part of 
the world soever I would send him ; and the two other men said the 
same. '* Well," savs I, "my conditions are but two ; first, that 
while you stay in this island with me, you will not pretend to any 
authority here ; and if I put arms in your hands, you will, upon all 
occasions, give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine 
upon this island, and in the mean time be governed by my oniers *, 
secondly, that if the ship is or may be recovered, you will carry me 
and my man to England passage free. * ' 

He gave me all the assurances that* the invention or faith of man 
could devise that he would comply with these most reasonable de- 
mands, and besides would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it 
upon all occasions as long as he lived. ** Well, then," said I, "here 
are three muskets for you, with powder and ball ; tell me next what 
you think is proper to be done." He showed all the testimonies of 
his gratitude that he was able, but offered to be wholly guided by 
me. I told him I thought it was hard venturing anything ; but the 
best method I could think of was to flre on them at once as they lay, 
and if any were not killed at the first volley, and offered to submit, 
we might save them, and so put it wholly upon God's providence to 
direct the shot. He said, very modestly, that he was loath to kill 
them, if he could help it ; but that those two were incorrigible vil- 
lains, and had been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if 
thev escaped, we should be undone still, for they would go on board 
and bring the whole ship's company, and destroy us ail. " Well, 
then," says I, " necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the only way 
to save our lives." However, seeing him still cautious of shedding 
blood, I told him they should go Siemselves, and manage as they 
found convenient 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and 
soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him if either 
of them were the heads of the mutiny. He said, "No." "Well, 
then," said I, " you may let theni escape ; and Providence seems to 
|}ave ^Mfakened ^eni oi^ purpose to s^ve theniselves. Novf/* says I, 



176 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



* ' if the rest escape you, it is your fault. * * Animated with this, he took 
the musket I had given liim in his hand, and a pistol in his heU, and 
his two comrades with him, with each a piece in his hand ; the two 
men who were with him, going first, made some noise, at which 
one of the seamen, who was awake, turned about, and seeing them 
coming, cried out to the rest ; but it was too late then, for the mo- 
ment te cried out they fired — I mean the two men, the captain wisely 
reserving his own piece. They had so well ainicd their shot at the 
men they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot and the 
other very much wounded ; but not being dead, he started up on his 
feet, and called eagerly for help to the other ; but the captain, step- 
ping to him, told him it was too late to cry for help ; he should call 
upon God to forgive his villainy, and with that word knocked him 
down with the stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more : 
there were three more in the company, and one of them was slight ly 
wounded. By this time I was come ; and when they saw "their 
danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. The 
captain told them he would spare their lives if they would give him 
an assurance of their abhorrence of the treachery they had been guiity 
of, and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and 
afterward in carrying her back to Jamaica, from whence they came. 
They gave him all the protestations of their sincerity that could be 
desired ; and he was willing to believe them, and spare their lives, 
which I was not against, on^^ that I obliged him to keep them bound 
hand and foot while they were on the island. 

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate to the 
boat, with orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and sails, 
which they did ; and by and by three straggling men, that were 
(happily for them) parted from the rest, came back upon hearing the 
guns fired ; and seeing the captain, who was before their prisoner, 
now their conqueror, they submitted to be bound also ; and so our 
victory was complete. 

It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one 
another's circumstances. I began first, and told him my whole hi8> 
tory, which he heard with an attention even to amazement — and par- 
ticularly at the wonderful manner of my being furnished with pro- 
visions and ammunition ; and, indeed, as my story is a whole collection 
of wonders, it affected him deeply. But when he reflected from 
thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have been preserved there 
on purpose to save his life, the tears ran down his face, and he could 
not speak a word more. After this communication was at an end, 
I carried him and his two men into my apartment, leading them in 
just where I came out, viz., at the top of the house, where I re- 
freshed him with such provision as I had, and showed them all the 
contrivances I had made during my long, long inhabiting that place. 

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing ; but 
above all, the captain admired my fortification, and how perfectly I

hud concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which, having been 
now planted near twenty years, and the trees growing much faster 
than in England, was become a little wood, so thick that it was im- 
passable in any part of it but at that one side where I had reserved 
my little winding passage into it. I told him this was my castle and 
my residence, but that I had a seat in the country, as most princes 
have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and 1 would show bim 
that-too another time ; but at present our business was to consider 
how to recover the ship. He agreed with me as to that, but told me 
he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take, for that there were 
still six-and-twenty hands on board, who, having entered into a cursed 
conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the law, 
would be hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it on, 
knowing that if they were subdued they would be brought to the 
gallows as soon as they came to England, or to any of the English col- 
onies, and that, therefore, there would be no attacking them with so 
small a number as we were. 

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it was a 
very rational conclusion, and that therefore something was to be re- 
solved on speedily, as well to draw the men on board into some snaro 
for their surprise as to prevent their landing upon us and destroying 
us. Upon this, it presently occurred to me that in a little while the 
ship's crew, wondering what was become of their comrades and of 
the boat, would certainly Cv)me on shore in their other boat to look for 
them, and that then, perhaps, they mi^ht come armed, and be too 
strong for us : this he allowed to be rational. Upon this, I told him 
the first thing we had to do was to stave the boat, which lay upon the 
beach, so that they might not carry her off, and taking everything out 
of her, leave her so far useless as not to be fit to swim. Accordingly 
we went on board, took the arms which were left on board out of 
hcT, and whatever else we found there, which was a bottle of brandy, 
and another of rum, a few biscuit cakes, a horn of powder, and a 
great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas (the sugar was five or six 
pounds) ; all which was very welcome to me, especially the brandy 
and sugar, of which I had had none left for many years. 

When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, mast, sail, 
and rudder of the boat were carried away before), we knocked a 
great hole in her bottom, that if they had' come strong enough to 
master us, yet th6y could not carry off the boat. Indeed, it was not 
much in my thoughts that we could be able to recover the ship ; but 
my view was, that if they went away without the boat, I did not 
much question to make her again fit to carry us to the Leeward 
Islands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had 
them still in my thoughts. 

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main 
strength, heaved the boat upon the beach, so hi^h that the tide would 
not float her off at high- water-mark, and, besides, had broke a hole 



y.

in her bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were set down mus- 
ing wliat we siiould do, we heard tlie ship lire a gun and make a 
waft with her ensign as a signal for the boat to come on board : but 
no boat stirred ; and they tired .seveial times, making other signals 
for the boat. At last, when all their signals and firing proved fruit- 
less, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help 
of my glasses, hoist another boat out and row toward the "shore ; 
and we found, as they approached, that there were no less than ten 
men in her, and that they had firearms with them. 

As the ship lay almost two leagues from' the shore, we had a full 
view of them as they came, f\nd a plain sight even of the^r faces ; 
because the tide having set them a little to the east of the other boat, 
they rowed up under shore, to come to the same place where the 
other had landed, and where the boat lay ; by this means, I say, 
we had a full view of them, and the captain knew the persons and 
characters of all the men in the Jboat, of whom, he said, there were 
three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into this con- 
spiracy by the rest, being overpowered and frightened ; but that as 
for the boatswain, who it seems was the chief oflScer among them, 
and all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew, 
and were no doubt made desperate in their new enterprise ; and ter- 
ribly apprehensive he was that they would be loo powerful for us. 
I smiled at him, and told him that men in our circumstances were 
past the operation of fear ; that seeing almost every condition that 
could be was better than that which we were supposed to be in, we 
ought to expect that the consequence, whether death or life, would be 
sure to be a deliverance. I asked him what he thought of the cir- 
cumstances of my life, and whether a deliverance were not worth 
venturing for ? ** And where, sir," said I, ** is your belief of my be- 
ing preserved here on purpose to save your life, which elevated you 
a little while ago ? For my part," said I, " there seems to be but one 
thing amiss in'all the prospect of it." ,** What is that?" says he. 
'* Why, " said I, *' it is that, as you say, there are three or four honest 
fellows among them, which should be spared ; had they been all of the 
wicked part of the crew, I should have thought God*s providence 
had singled them out to deliver them into your hands ; for depend 
upon it, every man that comes ashore is our own, and shall die or live 
as they behave to us. " As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheer- 
ful countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him ; so we set vigor- 
ously to our business. 

We had, upon the first appearance of the boats coming from the 
ship, considered of separating our prisoners ; and we had, indeed, 
secured them effectually. Two of them, of whom Ihe captain was 
loss assured tlian ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three 
delivered men, to my cave, where they were remote enough, and out 
of danger of being heard or discovered, or of finding their way out of 
the woods, if they could have delivered themselves : here ihsf left 



BOBINSOK CRUSOE. 179 

them bound, but gave them provisions ; and promised them, if they 
continued there quietly, to give them their liberty in a day or two ; 
but that if they attempted their escape, they should be put to dealh 
without mercy. They promised faithfully to bear their continenieut 
with patience, and were very thankful that they had such good usage as 
to have provisions and light left them ; for Friday gave them caudles 
(such as we made ourselvte) for their comfort : and tliey did not know 
but that he stood sentinel over them at the entrance. 

The other prisoners had, better usage ; two of them wefe kept pin- 
ioned indeed, because the captain was not able to trust them ; but 
the other two were taken into my service, upon the captain's recom- 
mendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to live and die with 
us ; so with them and the three honest men we were seven men, well 
armed ; and I made no doubt we should be able to deal well enough 
with the ten that were coming, considering that the captain had said 
there were three or four honest men among them also. As soon as 
they got to the place where their other boat lay, they ran their boat 
into the beach and came all on shore, hauling the boat up after them, 
which I was glad to see. for I was afraid they would rather have left 
the boat at an anchor some distance from the shore, with some hands 
in her to guard her, and so we should not be able to seize the boat. 
Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran all to their other 
boat ; and it was easy to see they were under a great surprise to find 
her stripped, as al)ove, of all that was in her, and a great hole in 
her bottom. After they had mused awhile upon this, they set up 
two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try if 
they could make their companions hear ; but all was to no purpose : 
then they came all close in a rin^, and fired a volley of their small 
arms, which, indeed, we hearcF, and the echoes made the woods 
ring : ,but it was all one ; those in the cave, we were sure, could not 
hear ; and those in our keeping, though they heard it well enough, 
yet durst give no answer to them. They were so astonished at the 
surprise of this, that, as they told us afterward, they resolved to go 
all on board again to their ship, and let them know that the men 
were all murdered, and the long-boat staved ; accordingly, they im- 
mediately launched their boat again, and got all of them on board. 

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at this, 
believing they would go on board the ship again, and set sail, giving 
their comrades over for lost, and so he should still lose the ship, which 
he was in hopes we should have recovered ; but he was quickly as 
much frightened the other way. 

They had not been long put oflF with the boat when we perceived 
them all coming on shore again ; but with this new measure in their 
conduct, which it seems they consulted together upon, viz., to leave 
three men in the boat, and the rest go on shore, and go up into the 
country to look for their fellows. This was a great disappointment 
to us, for now we were at a loss what to do, as our seizing those 



180 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

seven men on shore would be no advantage to us if we let the boat 
escape ; because they would row away to the ship, and then the rest 
of them would be sure to weigh and set sail, and so our recovering 
the ship would be lost. However, we had no remedy but to wait and 
see what the issue of things might present. The seven men came on 
shore, and the three who remained in the boat put her off to a good 
distance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait fo» them ; so 
that it was impossible for us to come at them in the boat. Those 
that came on shore kept close together, marching toward the top of 
the little hill under which my habitation lay ; and we could see them 
plainly, though they could not perceive us. We should have been 
very glad if they would have come nearer to us, so that we might 
have tired at them, or that they would have gone farther off, that we 
might come abroad. But when they were come to the brow of the 
hill where they could see a great way into the valleys and woods, 
which lay toward the north-eafst part, and where lh6 island lay low- 
est, they shouted and hallooed till they were weary : and not caring, 
it seems, to venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, 
they sat down together under a tree to consider it. Had they thought 
fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other part of them had done, 
they had done the job for us ; but they were too full of apprehensions 
of danger to venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell what 
the danger was they had to fear. 

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation 
of theirs, viz., that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to en- 
deavor to make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon 
them just at the juncture when their pieces were all discharged, and 
they would certainly yield, and we should have them without blood- 
shed. I liked this proposal, provided it was di[)ue while we were near 
enough to come up to them before they could load their pieces again. 
But this event did not happen ; and we lay still a long time, very 
irresolute what course to take. At length I told them ther^i would 
be nothing done, in my opinion, till night ; and then, if they did not 
return to the boat, perhaps we might find a wa3'^ to get between them 
and the shore, and so mi^ht use some stratagem with them in the boat 
to get them on shore. We waited a great while, though very im-' 
patient for their removing, and were very uneasy, when, after long 
consultation, we saw them all start up and march down toward the 
sea : it seems they had such dreadful apprehensions of the danger of 
the place that they resolved to go on board the ship again, give their 
companions over for lost, and so go on with their intended voyage 
with the ship. 

As soon as I perceived them go toward the ^lore, I imagined it to 
be, as it really was, that they had given over their search and were 
going back again ; and the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, 
was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it : but I presently th<Miglit 
of a stratagem to fetch them back again, and which answered m^r^nd

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 181 

to a tittle. I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over the 
little creek westward, toward the place where the savages came on 
shore when Friday was rescued, and so soon as Ihey came to a little 
rising ground, at about half a mile distance, I hade them halloo out, 
as loud as they could, and wait till they found the seamen heard 
them ; that as soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them, they 
fihouM return it again ; and then keeping out of sight, take a rounq, 
always answering when the others hallooed , to draw them as far into 
the island, and among the woods, as possible, and then wheel about 
again to me by such ways as I directed them. 

They were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate hal- 
looed ; and they presently heard them, and, answering, ran along the 
shore westward, toward the voice they heard, when they were stopped 
by the creek, where, the water being up, they could not get over, and 
called for the boat to come up and set them over ; as, indeed, I ex- 
pected. When they had set themselves over, I observed that the 
boat being gone a good way into the creek, and, as it were, in a har- 
bor within the land, the}' took one of the three men out of her, to 
go along with them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened her 
to the stump of a little tree on the shore. This was what I wished 
for ; and immediately leaving Friday and the captain's mate to tl)eir 
business, I took the rest witli me, and crossing the creek out of their 
sight, we surprised the two men before they were aware ; one of 
them lying on the shore and the other being in the boat. The fel- 
low on shore was between sleeping and waking, and going to start 
up : the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him and knocked 
him down ; and then called out to him in the boat to yield, or he 
was a dead man. There needed very few arguments to persuade a 
single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him and his com- 
rade knocked down ; besides, this was, it seems, one of the three T^ho 
were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew ; and there- 
fore was easily persuaded not only to yield but afterward to join 
very sincerely with us. In the mean time, Friday and the captain's 
mate so' well managed their business with the rest, that they drew 
them, by hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from 
one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired them, but left 
them where they were very sure they could not reach back to the 
boat before it was dark ; and, indeed, they were heartily tired them- 
selves also by the time they came back to us. 

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and 
to fan upon them, so as to make sure work with them. It was several 
hours after Friday came back to me before they came back to their 
lioat ; and we could hear the foremost of them, long before they 
came quite up, calling to those behind to come along ; and could also 
hear them answer, and complain how lame and tired they were, and 
not able to come any faster ; which was very welcome news to us. 
At length they came up to the boat : but it is impossible to express 



.nr- 



182 ROBINSON. CRUSOE, 

their confusion when they found the boat fast aground in the creek, 
tlie tide ebbed out, and their two men gone. We could hear them 
call to one another in a most lamentable manner, telling one uuother 
they were got into an enchanted island ; that either there were in- 
habitants in it, and they should all be murdered, or else there were 
devils and spirits in it, and they should be all carried away and de- 
voured. They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by 
their names a great many times : but no answer. After some time 
we could see them, bjr the little light there was, run about, wringing 
their hands like men in despair, and sometimes they would *go and 
sif down in the boat to rest themselves ; then come ashore again and 
walk about again, and so the same thing over again. My men would 
fain have had me give them leave to fall upon them at once lu the 
dark ; but I was willing to take them at some advantage, so as to 
spare them, and kill as few of them as I could ; and especially I was 
unwilling to hazard the killing any of our men, knowing (he others 
were very well armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not sep- 
arate ; and, therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade 
nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon I heir hands 
and feet, as close to the ground as they could, that they might not 
be discovered, and get as near them as they could possibly, before 
they offered to fire. 

They had not been long in that posture, when the boatswain, who 
was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown him- 
self the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking 
toward them, with two more of the crew : the captain was so eager 
at having this principal rogue so much in his power, that he could 
hardly have patience to let him come so near as to be sure of him, 
for they only heard his tongue before ; but when they came nearer, 
the* captain and Friday, starting up on their feet, let fly at them. 
The boatswain was killed upon the spot ; the next man was shot in 
the body, and fell just by him, though he did not die till an hour or 
two after ; and the third ran for it. At the noise of the fire, 1 im- 
mediately advanced with my whole army, which was now eight men ; 
viz., myself, generalissimo ; Friday, my lieutenant-general ; the cap- 
tain and his two men, and the three prisoners of war whom we had 
trusted with arms. We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that 
they could not see our number ; and I made the man they had left 
in the boat, who was now one of us, to call them by name, to try if 
I could bring them to a parley, and so perhaps might reduce them to 
terms ; which fell out just as we desired : for, indeed, it was easy to 
think, as their condition then was, they would be very willing to ca- 

Eitulate. So he calls out as loud as he could to one of them, " Tom 
mith ! Tom Smith !" Tom Smith answered immediately, ** Is that 
Robinson?" for it seems he knew the voice. The other answered, 
** Ay, ay : for God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms a^Q, 
yield, or you are all dead men this moment." *' Who must we ;ield 



>*•- * 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 183 

to? Where are they?** says Smith again. " Here they are," says 
he ; " here's our captaiu, and fifty men with him, have been hunt- 
ing you these two hours ; the boatswain is killed, Will Fry is wound- 
ed, and I am a prisoner ; and if you do not yield, you are all lost.** 
" Will they give us quarter then?*' says Tom Smith, " and we will 
yield." ** 111 go and ask, if you promise to yield," said Robinson : 
so he asked the captain ; and the captain hunself then called out, 
" You, Smith, you know my voice ; if 3'ou lay down your arms im- 
mediately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all but Will At- 
kins." 

Upon this, Will Atkins cried out, ** For €k)d*s sake, captain, give 
me quarter ; what have I done? They have all been as bad as I;" 
which, by ihe way, was not true ; for it seems this Will Atkins was 
the first man that laid hold of the captain, when they first mutinied, 
and used him barbarously in tying his hands and giving him injuri- 
ous language. However, the captain told him he must lay down 
his arms at discretion, and trust to the governor's mercy ; by which he 
meant me, for they all called me governor. In a word, they all laid 
down their arms and begged their lives ; and I sent the man that had 
parleyed with them, and two more, who bound them all ; and then 
my great army of fifty men, which, with those three, were in all but 
eight, came up and seized upon them and upon their boat ; only that 
I Kept myself and one more out of sight, for reasons of state. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the 
ship : and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, 
he expostulated with them upon the villainy of their practices with 
him, and upon the further wickedness of their design, and how cer- 
tainly it must bring them to misery and distress in the end, and per- 
haps to the gallows. They all appeared very penitent, and begged 
hard for their lives. As for that, he told them they were not his 
prisoners, but the commander*s of the island ; that they thought they 
had set him on shore in a barren, uninhabited island ; but it had 
pleased God so to direct them that it was inhabited, and that the 
governor was an Englishman ; that he might hang them all there, if 
ne pleased ; but as he had given them all quarter, he supposed he 
would send them to England, to be dealt with there as justice required, 
except Atkins, whom he was commanded by the governor to ad- 
vise to prepare for death, for that he would be hanged in the morning. 

Though this was all but a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired 
effect ; Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the captain to intercede 
with the governor for his life ; and all the rest begged of him, for 
God's sake, that they might not be sent to England. 

It now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was come, 
and that it would»be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be 
hearty in getting possession of the ship ; so I retired in the dark, 
from them, that they might not see what kind of a governor they had, 
and called the captain to me ; when I called, at a good distance, one 



>.' 



184 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

of the men was ordere'd to speak again, and say to the captain, " Cap-, 
tain, the commander calls for you ;" and presently the captain re- 
plied, " Tell his Excellency I am just coming." This more perfectly 
amazed them, and they all believed that the commander was just by, 
with his fifty men. Upon the captain coming to me, I told him my 
project for seizing the ship, which ha liked wonderfully well, and 
resolved to put in execution the next morniug. But in order to ex- 
ecute it with more art, and to be secure of success, I told him w« 
must divide the prisoners, and that he should go and take Atkins, 
and two more of the worst of them, and send them pinioned to the 
cave where the others lay. This was committed to Friday and the two 
men who came on shore with the captain. They conveyed them to 
the cave as to a prison : and it was, indeed, a dismal place, espeeially 
to men in their condition. The others I ordered to. my bowe^, as 1 
called it, of which I have given a full description : and as it was 
fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was secure enough, consider- 
ing they were upon their behavior. 

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into 
a parley with them ; in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he 
thought they might be trusted or not to go on board and surprise 
the ship. He talked to them of the injury done him, of the con- 
dition they were brought to, and that though the governor hfui 
given them quarter for iheir Uves as to the present action, j'et that 
if they were sent to England they would all be hanged in chains ; 
but that if they would join in so just an attempt as to recover the 
ship, he would have the governor's engagement for their pardon. 

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be ac- 
cepted by men in their condition ; they fell down on their ktiees to 
the captain, and promised, with the deepest imprecations, that they 
would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that they should owe 
their lives to him, and would go with him all over the world ; that 
th^ would own him as a father to them as long as they lived. 
** Well," says the captain, " I must go and tell the governor what 
you say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it.'* So 
he brought me an account of the temper he found them in, and tbaA 
he verily believed they would be faithful. However, that we might 
be very secure, I told him he should go back again and choose out 
those nve, and tell them that they might see he did not want men» 
that he would take out those five to be his assistants, and that the 
governor would keep the other two and the three that were sent 
prisoners to the castle (my cave) as hostages for the fidelity of those 
five ; and that if they proved unfaithful in the executioji, the five 
hostages should be hanged in chains alive on the shore. This looked 
severe, and convinced them that the governor wa^in earnest,: how- 
ever, they had no way left them but to accept it ; and it was now the 
business of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to persuade the 
other five to do their duty. 



ROBIKSON CRUSOE. 185 

Our strength was now thus ordered for the exp^ition : first, the 
captain, his mate, and passenger ; second, th«n the two prisoners of 
the first gang, to whom, having their character from the captain, I 
had given their liberty and trusted them with arms ; third, the 
other two that I had kept till now in my bower pinioned, but, on the 
captain's motion, had now released ; fourth, these five released at 
last ; so that they were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners 
in the cave for hostages. 

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands 
on board the ship : but as for me and my man Friday, I did not think 
it was proper for us to stir, having seven men left behind ; and it was 
employment enough for us to keep them asunder, and supply them 
with victuals. As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep ihem 
fast ; but Friday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with 
necessaries ; and I made the other two carry provisions to a certain 
distance, where Friday was to take it. 

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the 
captain, who told them I was the person the .governor had ordered 
to look after them ; and that it was the governor's pleasure they 
should not stir anywhere but by my direction ; that if they did they 
would be fetched into the castle and be laid in irons ; so that, as we 
never suffered them to see me as governor, I now appeared as another 
person, and spoke of the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the 
like, upon all occasions. 

The captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish his 
two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He made his 
passenger captain of one, with four of the men ; and himself, his 
mate, and five more, went in the other ; and they contrived their 
business very well, for they came up to the ship about midnight. 
4s soon as they came within call of the ship, he made Robinson hail 
them, and tell them they had brought off the men and the boat, but 
that it was a long time before they had found them, and the like ; 
holding them in a chat till they came to the ship's side ; when the 
captain and the mate, entering first with their arms, immediately 
Icaocked down the second mate and carpenter with the butt-end of 
their muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their men ; they 
secured all the rest that were upon the main and quarter-decks, and 
began to fasten the hatches, to keep them down that were below ; 
when the other boat and their men, entering at the forechains, 
secured the forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle which went down 
into the cook-room, making three men they found there prisoners. 
When this was done, and all sate upon deck, th^ captain ordered the 
mate, with three men, to break into the round-house, where the new 
rebel captain lay, who, having taken the alarm, had got up, and with 
two men and a boy had got firearms in their hands ; and when the 
niate,^ with a crow, split open the door, the new captain and his men 
fired boldly among them and wounded the mate with a musket-ball. 



186 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

which broke his arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed 
nobody. The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into the 
round-house, wounded as he was, and with his pistol shot the new 
captain through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth, and came 
out again behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a word 
more : upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken effectu- 
ally, without any more lives lost. 

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven 
guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give 
me notice of his success, which, you may be sure, I was very glad 
to hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it till near two 
o'clock in the morning. Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid 
me down ; and it having been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept 
very sound, till I was surprised with the noise of a gun ; and pres- 
ently starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of ** Governor ! 
Governor !*' and presently I knew the captain's voice ; when climb- 
ing up to the top of the hill, there he Ftood, and, pointing to the 
ship, he embraced me ijn his arms. ** My dear friend and deliverci , " 
says he, ** there's your ship ; for she is all jours, and so aie we, and 
all that belong to her.'* 1 cast my eyes to the ship, and there she 
rode, within little more than half a mile of the shore, for they had 
weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters of her, and, the 
weaAher being fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the 
mouth of the little creek ; and, the tide being up, the captain had 
brought the pinnace in near the place where I had first landed mv 
rafts, and so landed just at my door. I was at first ready to sink 
dowuMrith the surprise ; for I saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly 
put into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just ready to 
carry me away whither I pleased to go. At first, for some time. I 
was not abh; to answer him one word ; but as be. had taken me in his 
arms, I held fast by him or I should have fallen to the ground. He* 
perceived the surprise, and immediately pulkd a bottle out of his 
pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which he had braught on 
purpose for me. After I had drunk it, I sat down upon the ground ; 
and though it brought nie to mvself , yet it was a good while before 
I could speak a word to him. All this time the poor man was in as 
great an ecstasv as I, only not under any surprise, as I was ; and he 
said a thousand kind and tender things to me, to corapose and bring 
me to myself ^ but such was the fiood of joy in my breast that it put 
all mv spirits into confusion ; at last it bioke out into tears ; and, in 
a little while after, I recovered my speech. I then tdok my turn, 
and embraced him as my deliverer, and we rejoiced together. I told 
him I looked upon him as a man sent from heaven to. deliver me, 
and that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders ; that 
such things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand of 
Providence governing the world, and an evidence that the eye of aa 
infinite power could search into the remotest corner of the world, and

send help to the miserable whenever He pleased. I forgot not to lift 
up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven ; and what heart could for- 
bear to bless Him who had not only in a miraculous manner pro- 
vided for me in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, 
but from whom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to 
proceed ? 

When we had talked awhile, the captain told me he had brought me 
some little refresbment, such as the sbip afforded, and such as tho 
wretches that had been so long his masters had not plundered him 
of. Upon this, he called aloud to the boat, and bade his men bring 
the things ashore that were for the governor ; and, indeed, it was a 
present as if I had been one that was not to be carried away with 
them, but as if I had been to dwell upon the island still. First, he had 
brought me a case of bottles full of excellent cordial waters, six large 
bottles of Madeira wine (the bottles held two quarts each), two 
pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship's 
beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag of peas, and about a hundred- 
weight of biscuit ; he also brought me a box of sugar, a box of flour, 
a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of 
other things. But besides these, and what was a thousand times 
more useful to me, he brought me six new clean shirts, six very good 
neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair 
of stockings, with a very good suit of clothes of his own, which had 
been worn but very little': in a word, he clothed me from head to 
foot. It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one may im- 
agine, to one in my circumstances ; but never was anything in the 
world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy as it was to 
me to wear such clothes at first. 

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things 
were brought into my little apartment, we began to consult what was 
to be done with the prisoners we had ; for it was worth considering 
whether we might venture to take them away with us or no, espe- 
cially two of them, whom he knew to be incorrigible and refractory 
to the last degree ; and the captain said he knew they were such 
rogues that there was no obliging them, and if he did carry them 
away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to jus- 
tice at the first English colony he could come to ; and I found that 
the captain himself was very anxious about it. Upon this, I told 
him that, if he desired it, I would undertake to bring the two men 
he spoke of to make it their own request that he should leave them 
upon the island. ** I should be very glad of that," says the captain, 
** with all my heart." *' Well," says I, " I will send for them up, 
and talk with them for you." So I caused Friday and the two hos- 
tages, for they were now discharged, their comrades having per- 
formed their promise ; I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and 
bring up the five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep 
them there till I came. After some time, I came thither dressed in 



A^

my new habit ; and now I was called governor again. Being all 
met, and the captain wiih me, I caused the men to be brought be- 
fore me, and I told them I had got a full account of their villainous 
behavior to the captain, and how they had run away with the ship, 
and were preparing to commit further robberies, but that Pmvidence 
had insnared them in their own ways, and that they were fallen into 
the pit which they had dug for others. I let them know that by my 
direction the ship had been seized ; that she lay now in the road ; 
and they might see by and bv that their new captain had received 
the reward of his villainy, and that they would see him hanging at 
the yard-Urm ; that as to them, I wanted to know what they had to 
say why -I should not execute them as pirates, taken in the fact, as 
by my commission they could not doubt but I had authority so to do. 

One of them answered in the name of tEe rest, that they had 
nothing to say but this — that when they were taken, the captain 
promised them their lives, and they humbly implored my mercy. 
But I told them I knew not what mercy to show them ; for as for 
mvself, I had resolved to quit the island with all my men, and had 
taken passage with the captain to go for England ; and as for the 
captain, he could not carry them to England, other than as prisoners 
in irons, to be tried for mutiny and running away with the ship : 
the consequence of which, they must needs know, would be the gal- 
lows ; so that I could not tell what was best for them, unless they 
had a mind to take their fate in the island. If they desired tliat, as 
I had liberty to leave the island, I had some inclination to give them 
their lives if they thought they could shift on shore. They seemed 
very thankful for it, and said they would much rather venture to 
stay there than be carried to England to be hanged. So I left it on 
that issue. 

However, the captain seemed to make some diiBculty of it, as if 
he durst not leave them there. Upon this, I seemed a little angry 
with the captain, and told him that they were my prisoners, not his ; 
and that seeing I had offered them so much favor, I would be as 
good as my word ; and that if he did not think fit to consent to it, I 
would set them at liberty, as I found them ; and if he did not like it, 
he might take them again if he could catch them. Upon this, they 
appeared very thankful, and I accordingly set them at liberty and 
bade them retire into the woods, to the place whence they came, and I 
would leave them some firearms, some ammunition, ana some direc- 
tions how they should live very well, if they thought fit. Upon this 
I prepared to go on board the ship ; but told the captain I 'would 
stay that night to prepare my things, and desired him to go on board 
in the mean' time, and keep all right in the ship, and send the I)oat 
on shore next day for me ; ordering him, at all events, to cause 
the new captain, who was-killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that 
these men might see him. 

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me to my 



ROBINSON CRtJSOE. 189 

apartment, and entered seriously into discourse witli them on their 
Circumstances. I told them I thought they had made a right choice ; 
that if the captain had carried them away they would certainly be 
hanged. I showed them the nev^ captain hanging at the yard-arm 
of the ship, and told them they had nothing less to expect. 

When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then told 
them I would let them into the story of my living therfe, and put 
them into the way of making it easy to them. Accordingly I gave 
them the whole history of the place, and of my coming to it ; showed 
them my fortifications, the way I made my bread, planted my corn, 
cured my grapes ; an I, in a word, all that was necessary to make 
them easy. I told tliem the story also of the seventeen Spaniards 
that were to be expected, for whom I left a letter, and made them 
promise to treat them in common with themselves. Here it may be 
noted that the captain had ink on board, who was greatly surprised 
that I never hit upon a way of making ink of charcoal and water, or 
of something else, as 1 had done things much more difficult. 

I left thenl my firearms, viz., five muskets, three fowling-pieces, 
and three swords. I had above a barrel and a half of powder left ; 
for after the first year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I 
gave them a description of the way I managed the goats, and direc- 
tions to milk and fatten them, and to make both butter and cheese. 
In a word, I gave them every part of my own story ; and told them I 
should iDrevail with the captain to leave them two ban'els of gun- 
powder more, and some garden-seeds, which I told them I would 
have been \f;ry glad of. Also, I gave them the bag of peas which 
the captain had brought me to eat, and bade them be sure to sow and 
increase them. 

Having done all this, I left them the next day and went on board 
the ship. We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that 
night. The next morning early, two of the fl /e men came swimming 
to the ship's side, and, making tlie must lamentable complaint of the 
other thre3, begged to be taken into the ship for God's sake, for Ihev" 
should be murdered, and begged the captain to take them on board, 
though he hanged them immediately. Upon this the captain pre- 
tended to have no power without me ; but after some difficulty, and 
after their solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on 
board, and were, some time after, soundly whipped and pickled ; 
after which they proved very honest and quiet fellows. 

Some time after this the boat was ordered on shore, the tide being 
up, with the things promised to the men ; to which the captain, at 
my intercession, caused their chests and clothes to be added, which 
tUcy took, and were very thankful for. I also encouraged them by 
telling them that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take 
them in, I would not forget them. 

When I took leave of this island I carried on board, for relics, the 
great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots ;

also I forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned, which had, 
Irtin by me 80 long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and 
could hardly pass for silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled, 
as also the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship. And 
thus I left the island, the 19th of December, as I found by the ship's 
account, in the year 1686, after I had been upon it eight-and-twenty 
years, two months, and nineteen days ; being delivered from this 
second captivity the same day of the month thSt I first made my es- 
cape in the long-boat, from among the Moors of Sallee. In this 
vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in England the 11th of June, in 
the year 1687, having been thirty -five years absent. 

When I came to England I was as perfect a stranger to all the 
world as if I had never been known there. ' My benefactor and faithful 
steward, whom I had left my money in trust with, was alive, but 
had had great misfortunes in the world ; was become a widow the 
second time, and very low in the world. I made her very easy as to 
what she owed me, assuring her I would give her no trouble ; but, 
on the contrary, in gratitude for her former care and faithfulness to 
me, I relieved her as my little stock would afford ; which at that 
time would, indeed, allow me to do but little for her ; but I assured 
her I would never forget her former kindness to me ; nor did I for- 
get her when I bad sufficient to help her, as shall be observed in its 
proper place. 1 went down afterward into Yorkshire ; but my father 
was dead, and my mother and all the family extinct, except that I 
found two sisters and two of the children of one of my brothers ; 
and as I had been long ago given over for dead, there had been no 
provision made for me ; so that, in a word, I found nothing to re- 
lieve or assist me ; and that the little money I ti&d would not do 
much for me as to settling in the world 

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not expect ; 
and this was, that the master of the ship, whom I had so happily de- 
livered, and by the same means saved the ship and cargo, having 
given a very handsome account to the owners of the manner how I 
had saved the lives of the men and the ship, they invited me to meet 
them and some other merchants concerned, and all together made 
me a very handsome compliment upon the subject, and a present of 
almost £200 sterling. 

But after making several reflections upon the circumstances of mv 
life, and how little way this would go toward settling me in the world, 
I resolved to go to Lisbon and see if I might not come at some in- 
formation of the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what 
was become of my partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some 
years past given me over for dead. With this view I took shipping 
for Lisbon, where I arrived in April following ; my man Friday ac- 
companying me very honestly in all these ramblings, and proving a 
most faithful servant upon all occasions. When 1 came to Lisbon I 
found out, by inquiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my old 



:;dS^

• 
friend, the captain of the ship, who first took me up at sea off the 
shore of Africa. ,He was now grown old, and had left off g^ing to 
sea, having put his son, who was far from a young man, into his 
ship, and who still used the Brazil trade. The old man did oot know 
me ; and indeed I hardly knew him. But I soon brought him to my 
remembrance, and as soon brought myself to his remembrance, when 
I told him who I was. 

After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between 
us, I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my partner. 
The old man told me ho had not been m the Brazils for about nine 
years ; but that he could assure me that when he came away my 
partner was living ; but the trustees, whom 1 had joined with him lo 
take cognizance of my part, were both dead : that, however, he be- 
lieved I would have a very good account of the improvement of the 
plantation ; for that, upon the general belief of my being cast away 
and drowned, my trustees had given in the account of the produce of 
my part of the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, who had appro- 
priated it, in case I never came to claim it, one third to the king 
and two thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be expended 
for the benefit of the poor and for the conversion of the Indians to 
the Catholic faith : but that if I appeared, or any one for me, to 
claim the inheritance, it would be restored ; only that the improve- 
ment, or annual production, being distributed to charitable uses, 
could not be restored : but he assured me that the steward of the 
king's revenue from lands, and the providore, or steward of the 
monastery, had taken great care all along that the incumbent, that 
is to say, my partner, gave every year a faithful account of the prod- 
uce, of which they had duly received my moiety. I asked him if 
he knew to what height of improvement he had brouffht tbe planta- 
tion, and whether he thought it might be worth looking afl^r ; or 
whether, on my going thither, I should meet with any obstruction to 
my possessing my just right in the moiety. He told me he could 
not tell exactly to what degree the plantation was improved ; but 
this he knew, that my partner was grown exceeding rich upon the 
enjoying his part of it ; and that, to the best of his remembrance, he 
had heard that the king's third of my part, which was, it seems, 
granted away to some other monastery or religious house, amounted 
to above two hundred moidores a year : that as to my being restored 
to a quiet possession of it, there was no question to be made of that, 
my partner being alive to witness my title, and my name l>eing also 
enrolled in the register of the country ; also he told me that the sur- 
vivors of my two trustees were very fair, honest people, and v^ry 
wealthy ; and he believed I would not only have their assistance for 
putting me in possession, but would find a very considerable sum of 
money in their hands for my account, being the produce of the farm 
while their fathers held the trust, and before it was given up, as 
above ; which, as he remembered, was for about twelve yeara

.^^"^ showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, and 
inquired of the old captain how it came t) pass that tlie tlu^lees 
should thus dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had msy(ie 
my will, and had made him, the Portuguese captain, my universal 
heir, etc. 

He told me that was true ; hut that as there was no proof of my 
he'mg dead he could not act as executor until some certain account 
should come of my death ; and, hesides, he was not, willing to inter- 
meddle with a thing so remote : that it was true he had registered my 
will, and put in his claim ; and could he have given any account of 
my being dead or alive, he would have acted by procuiation, and 
taken possession of the ingenio (so they called the sugar>house), and 
have given his son, who was now at the Brazils, orders to do it 
** But," says the old man, " I have one piece of news to tell you, 
which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the rest ; and that 
is, believing you were lost, and all the world believing so also, your 
partner and trustee» did offer to account with me, in your name, for 
the first six or eight years' profits, which I received. There being 
at that time great disbursements for increasing the works, building 
an Ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to near so much $s 
afterward it produced : however," says the old man, ** I shall give 
you a true account of what I have received in all, and how I £kfie 
disposed of it. " 

After a few days* further conference with this ancient friend, lie 
brought me an account of the first six years' income of my plaotn^ 
tion, signed by the partner and the mercbant-truslees, being al^ 
deliverSi in goods, viz., tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besi 
rum, molasses, etc., which is the consequence of a sugar-work ; 
I found by this account that every year the income considerably 
creased ; but, as above, the disbursements being large, the sunn f| 
first was small : however, the old man let me see that he was deblQt. 
to me four hundred and seventy moidores of gold, besides i^3^ 
• chests of sugar and fifteen double roUs of tobacco, which were wk 
in his ship; he having been shipwrecked coming home to Lis^lXHI^ 
about eleven years after my leaving the place. The good man ^W 
began to' complain of his misfortunes, and how he had been obl!^|^ 
to make use of my money to recover his losses and buy him a sfc""^ 
in a new ship. ** However, my old friend," says hte, *' you sbatl' 
want a supply in your necessity ; and as soon as my son returns 
shall be fully satisfied." Upon this he pulls out an old ptiucll; 
gives me one hundred and sixty Portugal moidores in gold ;.; 
givins: the writings of liis title to the ship, which his son was 
the Brazils in, of which he was quarter-part owner, and his 
other, he puts them both into my hands for security for the rettfr- 

I was too much moved with the honesty and kmdness of ib^ "^ 
man to be able to bear this ; and remembering what he had 
me, how he had taken me up at sea, and how generously he had: 




E<.M,«» cn,«. au.m, , 1^^^ o.«r._P«. lit

me on all occasions, and particularly how sincere a friend he was^ 
now to nie, I could hardly refrain weeping at what he had said to 
me ; therefore I asked him if his circumstances admitted him lo 
spare so much money at that time, and if it would not straiten him. 
He told me he could not say but it might straiten him a little ; but, 
however, it was my money, and I might want it more than he. 

Everything the good man said was full of affection, and I could 
hardly refrain from tears while he spoke ; in short, I took one hun- 
dred of the moidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a re- 
ceipt for them : then I returned him the rest, and told him if ever I 
had possession of the plantation I would return the other to him also 
(as indeed I afterward did) ; and tliat as to the bill of sale of his part 
in his son*s ship, I would not take it by any means ; but that if I 
wanted the money, I found he was honest enough to pay me ; and if 
I did not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to expect, I 
would never have a penny more from him. 

When this was past, the old man asked me if he should put me 
into a method to make my claim to my plantation. I told him I 
thought to go over to it myself. He said I might do so if I pleased ; 
but that if I did not, there were ways enough to secure my right, 
and immediately to appropriate the profits to my use ; and as there 
were ships in the river of Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he 
made me enter my name in a public register, with his affidavit, affirm 
ing upon oath that I was alive, and that I was the same person who 
took up the land for the planting the said plantation at first. This 
being regularly attested by a notary, and a procuration affixed, he 
directed me to send it,, with a letter of his writing, to a merchant of 
his acquaintance at the place ; and then proposed m}*- staying with 
him till an account came of the return. 

Never was anything more honorable than tiie proceedings upon this 
procuration ; for in less than seven months 1 received a large packet 
from the survivors of my trustees, the merchants, for whose account 
I went to sea, in which were the following particular letters and 
papers inclosed : 

First, there was the account current of the produce of my farm or 
plantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced with my 
old Portuguese captain, being for six years ; the balance appeared to 
be one thousand one hundred and seventy, four moidores in my favor. 

Secondly, there was the account of four years more, while they 
kept the effects in their hands, before the government claimed the 
administration, as being the effects of a person not to be found, 
which they called civil death ; and the balance of this, the value of 
the plantation increasing, amounted to nineteen thousand four hun- 
dred and forty-six crusadocs, being about three thousand two hun- 
dred and forty moidores. 

Thirdly, there was the Prior of St. Augustine's account, who had 
received the profits for above fourteen years ; but not being able to

account for what was disposed of by the hospital, very honestly de- 
clared he had eight hundred and seventy-two moidores not distrib- 
uted, which he acknowledged to my account : as to the king's part, 
that refunded nothing. 

There was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me very affec- 
tionately upon my being sdive, giving me an account how the estate 
was improved, and what it produced a year ; with the particulars 
of the number of squares or acres that it contained, how planted, 
how many slaves there were upon it ; and making two-and-twenty 
crosses for blessings, told me he had said so many Ave Maiias to 
thank the Blessed Virgin tbat I was alive ; inviting me very passion- 
ately to come ov6r and take possession of my own ; and, in the mean 
time, to give him orders to whom he should deliver my effects, if I 
did not come myself ; concluding with a hearty tender of his friend- 
ship and that of his family ; and sent me, as a present, seven fine 
leopards' skins, which he had, it seems, received from Africa, by some 
other ship that he had sent thither, and wliich, it seems, had made 
a better voyage than I. He sent me also five chests of excellent 
sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large 
as moidores. By the same fleet, my two merchant-trustees shipped 
me one thousand two hundred chests of su^ar, eight hundred rolls of 
tobacco, and the rest of the whole account m gold. 

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was better 
than the beginning. It is impossible to express the flutterings of 
my very heart when I found all my wealth about me ; for as the 
Brazil ships come all in fleets, the same shipa which brought my 
letters brought my goods : and the effects were safe in the river 
before the letters came to my hand. In a word, I turned pale and 

frew sick ; and had not the old man run and fetched me a cordial 
believe the sudden surprise of joy had overset nature, and I had 
died upon the spot : nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so 
some hours, till a physician being sent for, and something of the real 
cause of my illness being known, he ordered me to be let blood ; 
after which I had relief, and grew well : but I verily believe if I had 
not been eased by a vent given in that manner to the spirits, I should 
have died. 

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand pounds 
sterling in money, and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the 
Brazils, of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of 
lands in England : and, in a word, I was in a condition which I 
scarce knew how to understand, or how to compose myself for the 
enjo3'ment of it. The first thing I did was to recompense my original 
benefactor, my good old captain, who had been first charitable to me 
in my distress, kind to me in my beginning, and honest to me at the 
end. I showed him all that was sent to me ; I told him that next 
to the providence of Heaven, which disposed all things, it was owing 
to him ; and that it now lay on me to reward him, which I would do 



KOBIN^SON CRUSOE. 195 

a hundredfold : so I first returned to him the hundred moidores I 
had received of him ; then I sent for a notary, and caused him to 
draw up a general release or discharge from the four hundred and 
seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged he owed me, in the 
fullest and firmest manner possible. After which, I caused a procu- 
ration to be drawn, empowering him to be the receiver of the annual 
profits of my plantation ; and appointing my partner to account to 
him, and make the returns, by the usual fleets, to him in my name ; 
and by a clause in the end made a grant of one hundred moidores a 
year to him during his life, out of the effects, and fifty moidores a 
year to his son after him, for his life ; and thus I requited my old man. 

I had now to consider which way to steer my course next, and 
what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put into my 
hands ; and indeed I had more care upon my head now that I had 
in my silent state of life in the island, wnere I wanted nothing 
but what I had, and had nothing but what I wanted ; whereas 
I had how a great charge upon me, and my business was how 
to secure it. I had not a cave now to hide my money in, or 
a place where it might lie without lock or key till it grew mouldy 
and tarnished before anybody would meddle with it ; on the 
contrary, I knew not where to put it or whom to trust with 
it. My old patron, the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the 
only refuge 1 had. In the next place, my interest in the Brazils 
seemed to summon me thither ; but now I could not tell how to think 
of going thither till I had settled my affairs and left my effects in 
some safe hands behind me. At first I thought of my old friend the 
widow, who I knew was honest, and would be just to me ; but then 
she was in years, and but poor, and, for aught 1 knew, might be in 
debt ; so that, in a word, I had no way but to go back to England 
myself and take my effects with me. 

It was. some months, however, before I resolved upon this ; and 
therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to his satis- 
faction, who had been my former benefactor, so I began to think of 
the poor widow whose husband had been my first benefactor, and 
she, while it was in her power, my faithful steward and instructor. 
So the first thing I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to write to his 
correspondent in London, not only to pay a bill, but to go find her 
out, and carry her in money a hundred pounds from me, and to talk 
with her and comfort her in her poverty, by .telling her she should, if, 
I lived, have a further supply : at the same time I sent my two 
sisters in the country a hundred pounds each, they being, though not 
in want, yet not in very good circumstances ; one having been mar- 
ried and left a widow ; and the other having a husband not so kind 
to her as he should be. But, among all my relations or acquaint- 
ances, I could not yet pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the 
gross of my stock, that I might go away to the Brazils and leave 
things safe behind me ; and tMs greatly perplexed me. 






196 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

I had once a mind to bave gone to the B^^azils, and have settled 
myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalized to the place ; but I 
had some little scruple in my mind about religion, which insensibly 
drew me back. However, it was not religion that kept me from 
going there for the present ; and as I had made no scrupje of being 
openly of the religion of the country all the while I was among them, 
80 neither did I yet ; only that now and then, having of late thought 
more of it than formerly, jpvhen I began to think of living and dying 
among them, I began to regret my having professed myself a Papist, 
and thought it might not be the best religion to die with. 

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that Icept me from 
going to the Brazils, but that really I did not know with whom to 
leave my effects behind me ; so I resolved at last lo go to England, 
where, if I arrived, I concluded I should make some acquaintance, 
or find some relations that would be faithful to me ; and accord- 
ingly I prepared to go to England with all my wealth. 

In order to prepare things for mv going home, I first (the Brazil 
fleet being just going away) resolved to give answers suitable to the 
just and faithful account of things I had from thence ; and, first, to 
the Prior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of thanks for his just 
dealings, and the offer of eight hundred and seventy-two moidores 
which were undisposed of, which I desired might be given, five hun- 
dred to the monastery, and three hundred and seventy-two to the 
poor, as the prior should direct ; desiring the good paSre's pi*ayers 
for me, and the like. I wrote next a letter of thanks to mj two 
trustees, with all the acknowledgment that so much justice and hon- 
esty called for : as for sending them any present, they were far above 
having any occasion for it. Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowl- 
edging his industry in the improving the plantation, and his integrity 
in increasing the stock of the works ; giving him instructions for his 
future government of my part, according to the powers I had left 
with my old patron, to whom I desired him to send whatever became 
due to me, till he should hear from me more particularly ; assuring 
him that it was my intention not only to come to him, but to settle 
myself there for the remainder of my life. To this I added a very 
handsome present of some Italian silks for his wife and two daugh- 
ters (for such the captain's son informed me he had), with two pieces 
of fine English broadcloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, five pieces 
of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a good value. 

Having thus settled nay affairs, sold my cargo, and turned all my 
effects into good bills of exchange, my next difficulty was which way 
to go to England : 1 had been accustomed enough to the sea, ancl 
yet I had a strange aversion to go to England by sea at that time ; 
and though I could give no reason for it, yet the difficulty increased 
upon me so much, that though I had once shipped my baggage in 
order to go, yet I altered my mind, and that not once, but two or 
three times.

ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 197 

It is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might be 
one of the reasons ; but let no man slight the strong impulses of bi^ 
own thoughts in cases of such moment : two of the-ships which 1 had 
singled out to go in, I mean more particularly singled out than any 
other, having put my things on board one of them, and in the other 
having agreed with the captain ; I say two of these ships miscarried ; 
viz., one was taken by the Algerihes and the other was cast awfty 
on the Start, near Torbay, and all the people drowned except three ; 
so that in either of those vessels I had been made miserable. 

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whom 
I communicaled everything, pressed me earnestly not to go bv sea, 
but either to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the Bay of 
Biscay to Kochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe journey 
by land to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover ; or to go up to Madrid, 
and so all the way by land through France. In a word, I was so 
prepossessed against my going by sea at all, except from Calais to 
Dover, that I resolved to travel all the way by land ; which, as I 
was not in haste, and did not value the charge, was by much the pleas- 
anter way : and to make it more so, my old captain brought an English 
gentleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to trav- 
el with me : after which we picked up two more English merchants 
also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Paris 
only ; so that in all there were six of us, and five servants ; the two 
merchants and the two Portuguese contenting themselves v/ith one 
servant between two, to save the charge ; and as for me, I got an Eng- 
lish sailor to travel with me as a servwit, besides my man Friday, 
who was too much a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of 
a servant on the road. 

In this manner I set out from Lisbon ; and our company being very 
well mounted and armed, we made a little troop, whereof they did 
me the honor to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest man 
as because I had two servants, and, indeed, was the origin of the 
whole journey. 

As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so I shall 
trouble you now with none of my land journal ; but some adventures 
that happened to us in this tedious and difficult journey I must not 
omit. 

When we came to Madrid, we, being all of lis strangers to Spain, 
were willing to stay some time to see the court of Spain, and what 
was worth observmg ; but it being the latter part of the summer, wo 
hastened away, and set out from Madrid about the middle of Octo- 
ber ; but when we came to the edge of Navarre we were alarmed, 
at several towns on the way, with an account that so much snow was 
fallen on the French side of the mountains that several travellers 
were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after having attempted at 
an extreme hazard to pass on. 

When we came to Pampeluna itself we found it so indeed ; and 



^T 



198 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

to me, that had been always used to a hot climate, and to countries 
yrhere I could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable : 
nor indeed was it more painful than surprising to come but ten 
days before out of Old Castile, where the weather was not only 
warm but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind from the 
Pyrenean Mountains so very keen, so severely cold, as to be intoler- 
able, and to endanger benumbing and perishing of our fingers and 
toes. 

Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw the mountains all 
covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never seen 
or felt before in his life. To mend the matter, when we came to 
Pampeluna, it continued snowing with so much violence and so long 
that the people said winter was come before its time ; and the roads, 
which were difficult before, were now quite impassable ; for, in a 
word, the snow lay in some places too thick for us to travel, and 
being not hard frozen, as is the case in the northern countries, there 
was no going without being in danger of being buried alive every 
step. We staid no less than twentj^ days at Pampeluna ; when (see- 
Jng the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its being better, for it 
was the severest winter all over Europe that had been known in 
the memory of man), I proposed that we should go away to Fontara- 
bia, and there take shipping for Bordeaux, which was a. very little 
voyage. But while I was considering this, there came in four 
French gentlemen, who, having been sti>pped on the French eide of 
the passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who, 
traversing the country near the head of Languedoc, had bruught them 
over the mountains by such ways that they were not much incom- 
moded with the snow ; for where they met with snow in any 
quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and 
their horses. We sent for this guide, who told us he would under- 
take to carry us the same way, with no hazard from the snow, pro- 
vided we were armed sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild 
beasts ; for, he said, in these great snows, it was frequent for some 
wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains, being made 
ravenous for want of food, the ground being covered with snow. 
We told him we were well enough prepared for such creatures as 
they were, if he would insure us from a kind of two-legged wolves, 
which, we are told, we were in most danger from, especially on the 
French side of the mountains. He satisfied us that there was no 
danger of that kind in the way that we were to go ; so we readily 
agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other gentlemen, with then 
servants, some French, some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted 
to go and were obliged to come back again. 

Accordingly we set out from Pampeluna with our guide, on th€ 
15th of November ; and, indeed, I was surprised, when, instead ot 
going forward, he came directly back with us on the same road thai 
we came from Madrid, about twenty miles ; when, having passed 






ROBINSON CRUSOE. 199 

two rivers, and come into the plain country, we found ourselves in a 
warm climate again, where the country was pleasant, and no snow 
to be seen ; but, on a sudden, turning to his left, he approached the 
iidountains another way ; and though it is true the hills and preci- 
pices looked dreadful, yet he made so m ny tours, such meanders, 
and led us by such winding ways, that we insensibly passed the 
height of the mountains without being much incumbered with the 
snow ; and all on a sudden he showed us the pleasant and fruitful pro- 
vinces of Languedoc and Gascony, all green and flourishing, though 
indeed at a great distance, and we had some rough way to pass still. 

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one 
whole day and a night so fast that we could not travel ; but he bade 
us be easy ; we should soon be past it all : we found, indeed, that 
we began to descend every day, and to come more north than be- 
fore ; and so, depending upon our guide, we went on. 

It was about two hours before night, when, our guide being some- 
thing before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three monstrous 
wolves, and after them a bear, from a hollow way adjoining to a 
thick wood : two of the wolves made at the guide, and had he been 
far before us he would have been devoured before we could have 
helped him ; one of them fastened upon his horse, and the other at- 
tacked the man with such violence that he had not time or presence 
of mind enough to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us 
most lustily. My man Friday being next me, I bade him ride up 
and see what was the matter. As soon as Friday came in sight of 
the man he hallooed out as loud as the other, " O master I O mas- 
ter !*' but like a bold fellow rode directly up to the poor man and 
with his pistol shot the wolf that attacked him in the head. 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday ; for, 
having been used to such creatures in his country, he had no fear 
upon him, but went cl^se up to him and shot him ; whereas, any 
other of us would have fired at a farther distance and have perhaps 
either missed the wolf or endangered shooting the man. 

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I ; and, in- 
deed, it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of Friday's 
pistol, we heard on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves ; 
and the noise, redoubled' by the echo of the mountains, appeared to 
us as if there had been a prodigious number of them ; and perhaps 
there was not such a few as that we had no cause of apprehension : 
however, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other that had fastened 
upon the horse left him immediately and fled, without doing him 
any damage, having happily fastened upon his head, where the boss- 
es of the bridle had stucR in his teeth. But the man was most 
hurt ; for the raging creature had bit him twice, once in the arm 
and the other time a little above his knee ; and though he had made 
some defence, he was just tumbling down by the disorder of his 
hoarse when Friday came up and shot the wolf.

200 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

It is easy t50 suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol wfe all 
mended our pace and rode up as fast as the way, which was very 
difficult, would give us leave, to see what was the matter. As soon 
as we came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we saw 
clearly what had been the case, and how Friday had disengaged the 
poor guide, though we did not presently discern what kind of creat* 
ure h was he had killed. 

But never was a fight managed so hardly, and in such a surprising 
manner, as that which followed between Friday and the bear, which 
gave us all, though at first we were surprised and afraid for him, the 
greatest diversion imaginable. As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creat* 
ure, and does not gallop as the wolf does, who is swift and li^ht, 
so he has two particular qualities, which generally are the rule oi his 
actions : first, as to men, who are not his proper prey (he does not 
usually attempt them, except they first attack him, unless he be ex- 
cessively hungry, which it is probable might now be the case, tlie 
ground being covered with snow), if you do not meddle with him 
he will not meddle with you ; but then you must take care to be 
very civil to him and give him the road, for he is a very nice gentle- 
man ; he will not go a step out of his way for a prince ; nay, if you 
are really afraid, your best way is to look another way and keep go- 
ing on ; for sometimes if you stop and stand still and look stead- 
fastly at him, he takes it for an affront . but if you throw or toss 
anything at him, and it hits him, though it were but a bit of stick as 
big as your finger, he thinks himself abused, and sets all oUier busi- 
ness aside to pursue his revenge, and will have satisfaction in point 
of honor — that is his first quality : the next is, if he be once 
affronted he will never leave you, night or day, till he has his re- 
venge, but follows at a good round rate till he overtakes you. 

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up to 
him he was helping him off his horse, for the man was both hurt 
and frightened, when on a sudden we espied the bear come out of 
the wood, and a monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I 
saw. We were all a little surprised when we saw him ; but when 
Friday saw him it was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow's 
countenance. ** O, O, 1" says Friday three times, pointing to 
him ; •* O master ! you give me te leave, me shakee te hand with 
him ; me makee j'ou gowl laugh." 

I was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased. "You fool,*' 
says I, ''he will eat you up." ** Eatee me up ! eatee me up !" says 
Friday, twice over again ; " me eatee him up ; me makee you good 
laugh ; you all stay here, me show you good laugh." So down he 
sits, and gets off his boots in a moment, and puts on a pair of pumps 
(as we call the flat shoes they wear, and which he had in his pocket), 
gives my other servant his horse, and with his gun away he flew, 
swift like the wind. 

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with nobody 



- ■ .-^a' 



ROBINSON CRtJSOB. 201 

tai Friday, coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear could un- 
derstand him. ** Hark ye, hark ye," says Friday, ** me speakee with 
you." We followed at a distance, for now l>eing come down on the 
Gascony side of the mountains we entered a vast forest, where the 
country was plain and pretty open, though it had many trees in it 
scattered here and there. Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of 
the bear, came up with him quickly, and took up a great stone and 
threw it at him, and hit him just on the head, but did him no more 
harm than if he had thrown it against a wall ; but it answeped Fri- 
day's end, for the rogue was so void of fear that he did it purely to 
make the bear follow him and show us some laugh, as he called it. 
As soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw him, he turns about and 
comes after him, taking very long strides, and shufflins on at a 
strange rate, so as would have put a horse to a middling gallop : away 
runs Friday, and takes his course as if he ran toward us for help ; so 
we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear and deliver my man ; 
though I was angry at him heartily for bringing the bear back upon 
us, when he was going about his own busmess another way ; and 
especially I was angry that he had turned the bear upon us, and then 
run away ; and I called out, '* You dog ! is this your making us 
laugh ? Come away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the 
creature." He heard me, and cried out, '* No shoot, no shoot ; stand 
still, and you get much laugh :" and as the nimble creature ran two 
feet for the bear's one, he turned on a sudden on one side of us, and 
seeing a great oak tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to fol- 
low ; and doubling his pace, he got nimbly up the tree, laying his 
gun down upon the ground, at about five or six yards from the bot- 
tom of the tree. The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed 
at a distance ; the first thing he did he stopped at the gun, smelled 
at it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a 
cat, though so monstrous heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I 
thought it, of my man, and could not for my life see anything to 
laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode near to 
him. 

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the small 
end of a large branch, and the bear got about half way to him. As 
Boon as the i)ear got out to that part where the limb of the tree was 
weaker, *' Ha !" says he to us, ** now you see me teachee the bear 
dance :*' so he began jumping and shaking the bough, at which the 
bear began to totter, but stood still, and began to look behind him 
to see how he should get back ; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. 
But Friday had not done with him by a great deal ; when seeing him 
stand still, he called out to him again, as if he had supposed the 
bear could speak English. "What, you come no farther? pray 
you come farther ;" so he left jumping and shaking the tree ; ana the 
bear, just as if he understood what he said, did come a little farther ; 
then he began jumping again, and the bear stopped again. We 



202 ROBINSON CRCSOE. 

thought now was a good time to knock him in the head, and called 
to Friday to stand still, and we would shoot the bear : but he cried 
o^it earnestly, " O pray ! O pray ! no shoot ; me shoot by and then :" 
he would have said by and by. However, to shorten the story, Fri- 
day danced so much and the bear stood so ticklish that we had 
laughing enough, but still could not imagine what the fellow would 
do : for first we thought he depended upon shakmg the bear off ; 
and we found the bear" was too cunning for that too ; for he would 
not go out far enough to be thrown down, but clung fast with his 
great broad claws and feet, so that we could not Imagine what would 
be the end of it, and what the jest would l>e at last. But Friday put 
us out of doubt quickly : for seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, 
and that he would not be persua3ed to come any farther, ** Well, 
well,*' says Friday, '* you no come farther, me go ; you no come to 
me, me come to you ;" and upon this he went out to the smaller end 
of the bough, where it would bend with his weight, and gently let 
himself down by it, sliding down the bough till he came near enough 
to jump down on his feet ; and away he ran to his gun, took it up, 
and stood still. ** Well," said I to him. ** Friday, what will you do 
now ? Why don't you shoot him ?' * * * No shoot, ' ' says Friday, * * no 
yet ; me shoot now, me no kill ; me stay, give you one more laugh :" 
and, indeed, so he did ; for when the bear saw his enemy gone he 
came back from the bough where he stood, but did it very cau- 
tiously, looking behind him every step, and coming backward till he 
got into the body of the tree ; then, with the same hinder end fore- 
most, he came down the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving 
one foot at a time very leisurely. At this juncture, and just before 
he could set his hind foot on the ground, Friday stepped up close to 
him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear. and shot him dead. 
Then tbe rogue turned about to see if we did not laugh ; and when he 
saw we were pleased, by our looks, he began to laugh very loud. 
"So we kill bear in my country," says Friday. *' So you kill 
them?" says I ; " why, you have no guns." *' No," says he, " no 
gun, but shQOt great much long arrow." This was a good diversion 
to us ; but we were still in a wild place, and our guide very much 
hurt, and what to do we hardly knew ; the howling of wolves ran 
much in my head ; and, indeed, except the noise I once heard on the 
shore of Africa, of which I have said something already, I never 
heaid anything that filled me with so much horror. 

These things and the approach of night called us off, or else, as 
Friday would have had us, we should certainly have taken the skin 
of this monstrous creature off, which was worth saving ; but we had 
near three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us : so we left him 
and went forward on our journey. 

The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep and 
.dangerous as on the mountains ; and the ravenous creatures, as we 
heanl afterward, were come down into the forest and plain country. 



BOBIKSON CRUSOE. • 203 

pressed by hung^, to seek for food, and had done a great deal of 
mischief m the villages, where they surprised the country people, 
killed a great many of their sheep and horses, and some people loo. 
We had one dangerous place to pass, and our ^ide told us, it there 
were more wolves in the country, we should nnd them there ; and 
this was a small plain surrounded with woods on every side, and a 
long narrow defile, or lane, which we were to pass to get through the 
wood, and then we should come- to the village where we were to 
lodge. It was within half an hour of sunset when we entered tlie 
wood, and a little after sunset when we came into the plain : we met 
with notliing in the first wood, except that in a little plain within the 
wood, which was not above two furlongs over, we saw five great 
wolves cross the road, full speed, one after another, as if they had 
been in chase of some prey and had it in view ; they took no notice 
of us, and were gone out of sight in a few moments. Upon this, our 
giiide, who, by the way, was but a faint-hearted fellow, bade us 
keep in a ready posture, for he believed there were more wolves 
a-coming. We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us ; but wo 
saw no more wolves till we came through that wood, which was near 
half- a league, and entered the plain. As soon as we came into the 
plain we had occasion enough to look about us : the first object we 
met with was a dead horse ; that is to say, a poor horse which the 
wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of them at work, we could 
not say eating him, but picking his bones rather ; for they had eaten 
up all the flesh before. We did not think tit to disturb them at their 
feast, neither did they take much notice of us. Friday Would have let 
fly at them, but I would not suffer him by any means ; for I found 
we were like to have more business upon our hands than we were 
aware of. We had not gone half over the plain, when we began to 
hear the wolves howl in the wood on our left in a frightful manner, 
and presentljr after we saw about a hundred coming on directly to- 
ward us, all in a body, and most of them in a line, as regularly as 
an army drawn up by experienced ofllcers. I scarce knew in what 
manner to receive them, but found to draw ourselves in a close line 
was the only way ; so we formed in a moment ; but that we might 
not have too much interval, I ordered that only every other man should 
fire, and that the others, who had not fired, should stand ready to 
give them a second volley immediately, if they continued to advauce 
upon us ; and then that those who had fired at first should not pre- 
tend to load their fusees again, but stand ready, every one with a 
pistol, for we were all armed with a fusee and a pair of pistols each 
man ; so we were, by this method, able to fire six volleys, half of us 
at a time ; however, at present we had no necessity ; for upon firing 
the first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being terrified as well by 
the noise as with the fire. Four of them, being shot in the head, 
dropped ; several others were wounded, and went bleeding off, as we 
could see by the snow. I found they stopped, but did not immedi- 



204 , ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

ately retfeat ; whereupon, ranemberinp: that I had been told Ibattho 
fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice of a man, I caused all the 
company to haHoo as loud as we could ; and I found the notion not 
altogether mistaken ; for upon our shout they began to retire and 
turn about. I then ordered a second volley to be fired in their rear, 
which put them to the gallop, and away they went to the woods. 
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again ; and that we might 
lose no time, we kept going ; but we had but little more than loaded 
our fusees and put ourselves in readiness when wo heard a terrible 
noise in the same wood on our left, only tliat it was farther onward, 
the same way we were to go. 

The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, which 
made it worse on our side ; but. tlie noise increasing, wfe could easily 
perceive that it was the howling and yelling of those hellish creat- 
ures ; and, on a sudden, we perceived two or three troops of wolves, 
one on our left, one behind us, and one in our front, so that we 
seemed to be surrounded with them : however, as they did not fall 
upon us we kept our way forward, as fast as we could make our 
horses go, which, the way being very rough, was only a good hard 
trot. In this manner we came in view or the entrance of a WQpd, 
through which we were to pass, at the farther side of the plain ; but 
we were greatly surprised, when coming nearer the lane or pass, we 
saw a confused number of wolves standing just at tlie entrance. On 
a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard the noise of a 
gun, and looking that way, out rushed a horse, with a saddle and a 
bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves 
after him full speed : the horse had the advantage of them ; but as 
we supposed that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not 
but they would get up with him at last ; no question but they did. 

But here we had a most horrible sight : for, ^ riding i?p to the 
entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcasses of an- 
other horse and of two men devoured by the ravenous creatures ; and 
one of the men was no doubt the same whom we heard fire the gun, 
for there lay a gun just by him fired off ; but as to the man, his head 
and the upper part of his body were eaten up. This filled us with 
horror, and we knew not what course to take ; but the creatures re- 
solved us soon, for they gathered about us presently, in liopes of 
prey ; and I verily believe there were three hundred of them. It 
happened, very much to our advantage, that at the entrance into the 
wood, but a little way from it, there lay some large timber- trees, 
which had been cut down the summer before, and I suppose lay 
there for carriage. I drew my little troop in among those trees, and 
placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I advised them all to 
alight, and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork, to stand in 
a triangle, or three fronts, inclosing our horses in the centre. We 
did so, and it was well we did ; for never was a more furious charge 
than the creatures made upon us in this place. They came on with 



V, 







KOBINSOK CRUSOE. 205 

a growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber, whieh, aa 
I said, was our breastwork, as if they were only rusliing upon their 
prey ; and this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by 
their seeing our horses behind us. I ordered our men to fire as be- 
fore, every other man j and they took their aim so sure that they killed 
several of the wolves at the first volley ; but there was a necessity to 
keep a continued firing, for they came on like devils, those behind 
pushing on those before. 

"When we had fired a second volley of our fusees we thought they 
stopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off, but it was but 
a moment, for others came forward again ; so we fired two volleys 
of our pistols ; and I believe in these four firings we had killed sev- 
enteen or eighteen of them and lamed twice as many, yet they came 
on again. I was loath to spend our shot too hastily ; so I called my 
servant, not my man Friday, for he was better employed, for, with 
the greatest dexterity imaginable, he had charged my fusee and 
his own while we were engaged — but. as I said, I called my other 
man, and giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a train all 
along the piece of timber, and let it be a large train. He did so, and 
had but just time to get away, when the wolves came up to it, and 
some got upon it, when I, snapping an imcharged pistol close to the 
powder, set it on fire ; those that were upon the limber w(!re 
scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell, or rather jumped in 
among us with the force and fright of the fire : wo dispatched these 
in an mstant, and the rest vtere so frightened with the light, which 
the night— for it was now very dark— made more terrible, that they 
drew back a little ; upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired 
off in one volley, and after that we gave a shout ; upon this the 
wolves turned tail, and we sallied inmiediately upon near twenty 
lame ones that we found struggling on the ground, and fell to cut- 
ting them with our swords, which answered our expectation, for the 
crymg and howling they made was better understood by their fel- 
lows ; so that they all fied and left us. 

We had, first and last, killed about threescore of them, and had it 
been daylight we had killed many more. The field of battle being 
thus cleared, we made forward again, for we had still near a league 
to go. We heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods 
as we went, several times, and sometimes we fancied we saw some of . 
them ; but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain. In 
about an hour more we came to the town where we were to lodge, 
which we found in a terrible fright, and all in arms, for, it seems, 
the night before the wolves and some bears had broke into the vil- 
lage and put them in such terror, that they were obliged to keep 
guard night and day, but especially in the night, to preserve their 
cattle, and indeed their people. 

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so 
much with the raiSding of his two wounds, that he could go no

farther ; so we were obliged to take a Dew guide here, and go to 
Toulouse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful, plftasant coun- 
try, and no snow, no wolves, nor anything like them ; but when 
we told our story at Toulouse, they told us it was nothing but what 
was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the mountains, espe- 
cially when the snow lay on the ground ; but they inquiied much 
what kind of a guide we had got, who would venture to bring us 
that way in such a severe season, and told us it was surprising wo 
were not all devoured. "When we told them how we placed our- 
selves and the horses in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and 
told us it was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed, for it was 
the sight of the horses which made the wolves so furious, seeiug their 
prey, and that at other times they are really afraid of a gun ; but 
being excessively hungry, and raging on that account, the eagerness 
to come at ttie horses had made them senseless of danger, and that if 
we had not by the continued tire, and at last by the stratagem of the 
train of powder, mastered them, it had been great odds but that we 
had been torn to pieces ; whereas, had we been content to have sat 
still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not have taken 
the horses so much for their own, when men were on their backs, 
as otherwise ; and, withal, they told us that at last, if we had stood 
all together, and left our horses, they would have been so eager to 
have devoured them that we might have come off safe, especially 
having our firearms in our hands, and being* so many in number. 
For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in my life ; for, see- 
ing above three huudred devils come roaring and open-mouthed to 
devour us, and having nothing to shelter us or retreat to, I'gave my- 
self over for lost ; and, as it was, I believe I shall never care to cross 
those mountains again ; I think I would much rather go a thousand 
leagues by sea, thousrh I was sure to meet with a storm once a week. 

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through 
France — nothing but what other travellers have given an account of 
with much more advantage than I can. I travelled from Toulouse 
to Paris, and without any considerable stay came to Calais, and 
landed safe at Dover the 14th of January, after having e severe cold 
season to travel in. 

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little 
time all my new- disco verefl estate safe about me, the bills of ex- 
change which I brought with me having been very currently paid. 

My principal guide and privy-counsellor was my good ancient 
widow, who, in gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought no 
pains too much nor care too great to employ for me ; and I trusted 
her so entirely with everything that I was perfectly easy as to the 
security of my effects ; and, indeed, I was very happy from the be- 
ginning, and now to the end, in the unspotted integrity of this good 
gentlewoman. 

And now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation in the Bra- 



•.' 



KOBINSO]Sr CRUSOE. 207 

zils, I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who having offered it to the 
two mercliants, the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Bra- 
zils, they accepted the offer, and remitted thirty-three thousand 
preces-of-eight to a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon to pay for it. 

In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form which they 
sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me the bills 
of exchange for thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces-of-eight 
for the estate, reserving the payment of one hundred moidores a year 
to him (the old man) during his life, and fifty moidores afterward to 
his son for his life, which I had promised them, and which the plan- 
tation was to make good as a rent-charge. And thus I have given 
the first part of a life of fortune and adventure — a life of I'rovi- 
dence's checker-work, and of a variety which the world wUl seldom 
be able to show the like of — beginning foolishly, but closing much 
more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so much as to 
hope for. 

Any one would think that in this state of complicated good fortune 
I was past running any more hazards ; and so, indeed, I iiiul been, if 
other circumstances had concurred ; but 1 was inured to a wander- 
ing life, had no family, nor many relations ; nor, however rich, had 
I contracted much acquaintance ; and though I had sold my estate in 
the Brazils, yet I could not keep that country out of my head, and 
had a great mind to be upon the wing again ; especially I could not 
resist the strong inclination I had to see my island, and to know if 
the poor Spaniards were in being there. My true fiiend, the widow, 
earnestly dissuaded me from it, and so far prevailed with me that 
for almost seven years she prevented my running abroad, during 
which time I took my two nephews, the children of one of my brotli- 
ers, into my care ; the eldest having something of his own, I bred 
up as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement oi some addition to his 
estate after my deceaJse. The other I placed with the captain of a 
ship ; and after five years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising 
young fellow, I put him into a good ship and sent him to sea ; and 
this young fellow afterward drew me in, as old as I was, to further 
adventures myself. 

In the mean time I iif part settled myself here ; for. first of all, I 
married, and that not either to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, 
and had three children, two sons and one daughter ; but my wife 
dying, and my nephew coming home with good success from a voy- 
age to Spain, my inclination to go abroad and his importunity pre- 
vailed, and engaged me to go in his ship as a private trader to the 
East Indies : this was in the year 1694. 

In this voyage I visited my new colony in the island — saw my suc- 
cessors Hie Spaniards — had the whole story of their lives, and of the 
"villains I left there — how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards — 
how they afterwaid agreed, disagreea, united, separated, and how at 
last the Spaniards were obliged to use violence with them— how they 



208 B0BTS801SC CRUSOB. 

were gobjected to the Bpainaids — ^how honestly the Spaniards used 
them ; a histoiy, if it were entered into, as full of variety and won- 
derful accidents as my own part — particolarly, also, as to their bat- 
tles with the Caribbesms, who landed several times upon the island, 
and as to the improvement they made upon the island itself — and 
how A^e of them made an attempt upon the mainland and brought 
away eleven men and five women prisoners, by which, at my com- 
ing. I found about twenty young c^dren on the island. 

llere I staid about twenty days — left them supi^ies of all neces- 
'sary things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes, tools, 
and two workmen, which I brought from England with me, viz., a 
carpenter and a smith. 

Besides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, reserved to 
myself the property of the whole, but gave them such parts respect- 
ively as they agreed on ; and having settled all things with them, and 
engaged them not to leave the place, I left them there. 

From thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent a bark, 
which I brought there, with more people to the island ; and in it, be- 
sides other supplies, I sent seven women, being such as I found 
proper for service, or for wives to such as would take them. As to 
the Englishmen, I promised th^n to send them some women from 
England, with a good cargo of necessaries, if they would apply them- 
selves to planting — which I afterward could not perform. The fel- 
lows proved very honest and diligent after they were mastered, and 
had their properties set apart for them. I sent them also from the 
Brazils five cows,. three of them being big with calf, some sheep, 
and some hogs, which when I came again were considerably in- 
creased. 

But all these things, with an account how three hundred Caribbees 
came and invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and how they 
fought with that whole number twice, and were at first defeated and 
one of them killed ; but at last, a storm destroying their enemies' 
canoes, they famished or destroyc^d almost all the rest, and renewed 
and recovered the possession of their plantation, and still lived upon 
the island. 

All these things, with some very surprising incidents in some new 
adventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall give a further ac- 
count of in the second part of my history^ 



THE 

FURTHER ADVENTURES 



OF 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 



That homely proverb, used on so many occasions in England, 
viz., ** That what is bred in the bone will not ^o out of the nesh," 
was never more verifled than in the story of my life. Any one would 
think that after thirtv-five years' affliction, ana a variety of unhappy 
circumstances, which few men, if any, ever went through before, 
and after near seven years of peace and enjoyment in the fulness of 
all things, grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed me to 
have haa experience of every state of middle life, and to know which 
was most adapted to make a man completely happy— I say, after all 
this, any one would have thought that the native propensity to ram- 
bling, which I gave an account of in my first setting out in the world 
to have been so predominant in my thoughts, should be worn out, the 
volatile part be fully evacuated, or at least condensed, and I might, 
at sixty-one years of age, have been a little inclined to stay at home, 
and have done venturing life and fortune any more. 

Nay, further, the common motive of foreign adventures was taken 
away in me, for I had no fortune to make ; I had nothing to seek : 
if I had gained ten thousand pounds I had been no richer ; for I had 
already sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave it to ; and 
what I had was visibly increasing ; for having no great family, I 
could not spend the Income of what I had unless I would set up for 
an expensive way of living, such as a great family, servants, equipage, 
gayety, and the like, which were things I had no notion of, or incli- 
nation to ; so that I had nothing, indeed, to do but to sit still and 
fully enjoy what I had got, and see it increase daily upon my hands. 
Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at least not enough 
to resist the strong inclination I had to go abroad again, which hung 



r-t 



210 ROBINSOX CRUSOE. 

about me like a chrooical distemper. In particalar, the desire of see- 
io^ my new plantation in the island, and the eolonj I left there, ran 
in my head continually. I dreamed of it all ni^ht, and my imagina- 
tion ran upon it all day ; it was uppermost in all my thoughts ; and 
my fancy worked so steadily and strongly upon it that I talked of it 
in my sleep ; in short, nothing could remove it out of my mind : it 
even broke so violently into all my discourses that it made my con- 
versation tiresome, for I could talk of nothing else ; all my discourse 
ran into it, even to impertinence ; and I saw it myself. . 

I have often heard persons of good judgment say, that all the stir 
people make m the world about ghosts and apparitions is owing to 
the strength of imagination and the powerful operation of fancy in 
their minds ; that there is no such thing as a spirit appearing or a 
ghost walking ; that people's poring affectionately upon the piist con- 
versation of their deceased friends so realizes it to them that they 
are capable of fancying, upon some exiraordinarj'' circumstances, 
that they see them, talk to them, and are answered by them, when, 
in truth, there is nothing but shadow and vapor in the thing, and 
they really know nothing of the matter. 

For my part, I know not to this hour whether there are any such 
things as real apparitions, spectres, or walking of people after they 
are dead ; or whether there is anything in the stories they tell us of 
that kind more than the product of vapors, sick minds, and wander- 
ing fancies : but this I know, that my imagination worked up to 
such a height, and brought me into such excess of vapors, or what 
else I may call it, that I actually supposed myself often upon the 
spot, at my old castle, behind the trees ; saw my old Spaniard, Fri- 
day's father, and the reprobate sailors I left upon the island ; nay, I 
fancied I talked with them, and looked at them steadily, though I 
was broad awake, as at persons just before me ; and this I did till I 
often frightened myself with the images my fancy represented to me. 
One time, in my sleep, I had the villainy of the three pirate sailors so 
lively related to me by the first Spaniard and Friday's father that it 
was surprising : they told me how they barbarously attempted to 
murder all the Spaniards, and that they set fire to the provisions they 
had laid up, on purpose to distress and starve them ; things that I 
had never heard of, and that, indeed, were never all of them true in 
fact : but it was so warm in my imagination, and so realized to me, 
that, to the hour I saw them, I could not be persuaded but that it 
was, or would be, true : also how I resented it, when the Spaniard 
complained to me ; and how I brought them to justice, tried them, 
and ordered them all three to be hanged. What there was really in 
this shall he seen in its place : for however I came to form such 
things in my dream, and what secret converse of spirits injected it, 
yet tliere was, I sav, much of it true. 1 own that this dream had 
nothing in it literally and specifically true ; but the general part was 
80 true — the base, villainous behavior of these three hardened rogues 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 211 

Tfas such, and had been so much worse than all I can describe, that 
the dream had too much simihtude of the fact ; and as I would after- 
ward have punished tbem severely, so, if I had hanged them all, I 
had been much in the right, and even should have been justified both 
by the laws of God and man. But to return to my story : In this kind 
of temper I lived some years ; I had no enjoyment of my life, no pleas- 
ant hours, no agreeable diversion, but what had something or other 
of this in it ; so that my wife, who saw my mind wholly bent upon 
it, told me very serfously one night that she believed there was some 
secret, powerful impulse of Providence upon me which had deter- 
mined me to go thither again ; and that she found nothing hindered 
my going but my being engaged to a wife and children. She told 
me that it was true she could not think of parting with me : but as 
she was assured that if she was dead it would be the first thing I 
would do, so, as it seemed to her that the thing was determined 
above, she would not be the only obstruction ; for, if I thought fit 
and resolved to go — [Here she found me very intent upon her 
words, and that I looked very earnestly at her, so that it a little dis- 
ordered her, and she stopped. I asked her why she did ndt go on, 
and say out what she was going to say ? But I perceived that her 
heart was too full, and some tears stood in her eyes.] " Speak out, 
my dear," said I; '* are you willing I should go? *'3So," says 
she. very affectionately, ** I am far from willing ; but if you are re- 
solved to go," says she, '* rather than I would be the only hin- 
drance, I will go with you : for though I think it a most preposter- 
ous thing for one of your years and in your condition, yet, if it must 
be," sai{l she, agaiu weeping, ** I would not leave you ; for, if it he 
of Heaven, y6n must do it ; there is no resisting it ; and if Heaven 
make it your duty to go, he will also make it mine to go with you, 
or otherwise dispose of me that 1 may not obstruct it." 

This affectionate behavior of my wife's brought me a little out of 
the vapors, and I began to consider what I was doing ; I corrected 
my wandering fancy, and began to argue with myself sedately wluit 
business I had, after threescore years, and after such a life of tedious 
sufferings and disasters, and closed in so happy and easy a manner — 
I say, what business had I to rush into new hazards and put myself 
upon adventures fit only for youth and poverty to run into ? 

With these thoughts I considered my new enga|?ement ; that I 
had a wife, one child born, and my wife then great with child of 
another ; that I had all the world could give me, and had no need to 
seek hazard for gain ; that I was declining in years, and ought to 
think rather of leaving what I had gained than of seeking to in- 
crease it ; that as to what my wife had said of its being an impulse 
from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go, I had no notion of 
that ; so, after many of these cogitations, I struggled with the power 
of my imagination, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe people may 
always do in like cases if they will ; and, in a word, I conquered it ; 



212 BOBINSOir CBUSOB. 

composed myself with such arguments as occurred to my thought^ 
and which my present condition furnished me plentifully with : and 
particularly, as the most effectual method, I resolved to divert my- 
self with other things, and to engage in some business that might 
effectually tie me up from any more excursions of this kind ; for I 
found that thing return upon me chiefly when I was idle, and ha^l 
nothing to do, nor anything of moment immediately before mu. To 
this purpose, I bought a little farm in the county of Bedford, and 
resolved to remove myself thither. I had a little convenient housa 
upon it, and the land about it I found was capable of great im- 
provement ; and it was many ways suited to my inclination, which 
delighted in cultivating, managing, planting, and improving of land ; 
and particularly, being an inland country, I was removed from con- 
versing among sailors, and things relating to the remote parts of the 
worid. 

In a word. I went down to my farm, settled my family, bought 
ploughs, harrows, a cart, wagon, horses, cows, and sheep, and, set- 
ting seriously to work, became in one half year a mere country gen- 
tleman : my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my ser- 
vants, cultivating the ground, inclosing, planting, etc. ; and I lived, 
as I thought, the most agreeable life that nature was capable of direct- 
ing, or that a man always bred to misfortunes was capable of re- 
treating to. 

I farmed upon my own land ; I had no rent to pay, was limited by 
no articles ; I could pull up or cut down as I pleased : what I planted 
was for myself, and what I improved was for my family ; and imv- 
ing thus left off the thoughts of wandering, I had not the least dis- 
comfort in any part of life as to this world. Now I thought indeed 
that I enjoyed the middle state of life, which my father so earnestly 
recommended to me, and lived a kind of heavenly life, something 
like what is described by the poet, upon the subject of a country 

life: 

** Free from vices, free from care. 
Age hu8 no pain, and youth no snare.*^ 

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from unseen Provi- 
dence unhinged me at once ; and not only made a breach upon me 
inevitable and incurable, but drove me, by its consequences, into a 
deep relapse of the wandering disposition, which, as I may sav, be- 
ing bom in my very blood, soon recovered its hold of me ; and, like 
the returns of a violent distemper, came on with an irresistible force 
upon me. This blow was the loss of my wife. It is not my busi- 
ness here to write an elegy upon my wife, give a character of her par- 
ticular virtues, and make my court to the sex by the flattery of a 
funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, the stay of all my affairs, 
the centre of all my enterprises, the engine that, by her prudence, 
reduced me to that happy compass I was in, from the most extrava- 
gant and ruinous project that filled my head, and did more to guide 




ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 213 

V 

my rambling genius than a mother*s tears, a father's instruction, a 
friend's counsel, or all my own reasoning powers could do. I was 
happy in listening to her, and in being moved by her entreaties ; and 
to the last degree desolate and dislocated in the world by the loss of 
her. 

When she was gone the world looked awkwardly round me. I 
was as much a stranger in it, in my thoughts, as I was in the Bra- 
zils, when I first went on shore there ; and as much alooe, except 
for the assistance of servants, as I was in my i^aud. I knew neither 
what to think nor what to do. I saw the world busy around me ; 
one part laboring for bread, another part squandering in vile ex- 
cesses, or empty pleasures, equally miserable, because the end they 
proposed still ned from them ; for the men of pleasure every day 
surfeited of their vice, and heaped up work for sorrow and repent- 
ance ; and thj men of labor spent their strength in daily struggling 
for bread to maintain the vital strength they labored with ; so living 
in a daily circulation of sorrow, liviug but to work, and Working 
but to live, as if dailv bread were the only end of wearisome life, 
and a wearisome life the only occasion of daily bread. 

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the inland ; 
where I suffered no more corn to grow, because I did not want it ; 
and bred no more goats, because I had no more use for them ; where 
the money lay in the drawer till it grew mouldy, and had scarce tho 
favor to be looked upon in twenty years. 

All these thines, had I improved them as I ought to have done, 
and as reason and religion had dictated to me, would have taught me 
to search farther than human enjoyments for a full felicity ; and tiiat 
there was something which certainly was the reason and end of life, 
superior to all these things, and which was either to be possessed, or 
at least hoped for, on this side the grave. 

But my sage counsellor was gone : I was like a ship without a 
pilot, that could only run afore the wind. My thoughts ran all 
away again into the old affair ; my head was quite turned with the 
whimseys of foreign adventures ; and all the pleasant, innocent 
amusements of my farm, my garden, my cattle, and my family, 
"which before entirely possessed me, were nothing to me, had no 
relish, and were like music to one that has no ear, or food to one 
that has no taste : in a word, I resolved to leave off housekeeping, 
let my farm, and return to London ; and in a few months after I did 

80. 

When I came to London I was still as unetisy as I was hi€ore ; 
I had no relish for the place, no employment in it, nothing to do but 
to saunter about like an idle person, of whom it may be said he ia 
perfectly useless in God's ci'eation, and it is not one farthing's matter 
to the rest of his kind whether he be dead or alive. Tliis also was 
the thing which, of all circumstances of life, was the most niy aver- 
sion, who had been all my days used to an active life ; and I would 



214 KOBIKSOK CRUSOE. 

often sav to myself, ** A state of idleness is the very dregs of life ;" 
and, indeed, I thought I was much more suitably employed when I 
was twenty-six days making a deal board. 

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my nephew, 
whom, as I have observed before, I had brought up to the sea, and 
had made him commander of a ship, was come home from a short 
voyage to Bilboa, being the first he had made. He came to me, and 
told me that some merchants of his acquaintance had been proposing 
to him to go a voyage for them to the East Indies, and to China, as 
private traders. "And now, uncle," says he, '*if you will go to 
sea with me, I will engage to land you upon your old habitation in 
the island ; for we are to touch at the Brazils. 

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state, and of 
the existence of an invisible world, than the concurrence of second 
causes with the ideas of things which we form in our minds, per- 
fectly reserved, and not communicated to any in the world. 

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wandering 
was returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had in his 
thought to say, when that very morning, before he came to me, I 
had, in a great deal of confusion of thought, tind revolving every 
part of my circumstances in my mind, come to this resolution, that 
I would go to Lisbon and consult with my old sea-captain ; and- if it 
was rational and practicable I would go and see the island again, 
and what was become of my people there. I had pleased myself 
with the thoughts of peopling the place and carrying inhabitants 
from hence, getting a patent for the possession, and I know not 
what ; when, in the middle of all this, in comes my nephew, as I 
have said, with his project of carrying me thither in his way to the 
East Indies. 

I paused awhile at his words, and looking steadily at him, 
""What devil.'* said I, "sent you on this unlucky errand?" My 
nephew stared as if he had been frightened, at first ; but perceiving 
that I was not much displeased with the proposal, he recovered him- 
self. " I hope it may not be an unlucky proposal, sir," says he ; 
" I dare say you would be pleased to see your new colony there, 
where you once reigned with more felicity than most of your brother 
monarchs in the world." 

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my temper, t;hat is to 
say, the prepossession I was under, and of which I have said so 
much, that I told him, in a few words, if he agreed with the mer- 
chants, I would go with him ; but I told him I would not promise to 
jTO any farther than my own island. ** Why, sir," says he, ** you 
aon't want to be left there again, I hope ?" ** Why," said I, " can 
you not takc^me up again on your return?" He told me it would 
not be possible to do so ; that the merchants would never allow him 
to come that way with a laden ship of such value, it being a month *s 
sail out of his way, and might be thi'ee or four. " Besides, su*, if I 



-m^M. 



ROBINSON" CRUSOE. 215 

should miscarrv," said he, **and not return at all, then you would 
be Just reduced, to the condition you were in before.'* 

This was very rational ;* bat we both found out a remedy for it ; 
which was, to carry a framed sloop on board the ship, which, being 
taken in pieces and shipped on board the ship, might, by the help of 
some carpenters whom we agreed to carry with us, be set up again 
in the island, and finished fit to go to sea m a few days. 

I was not long resolving ; for, indeed, the importunities of my 
nephew joined so effectually with my inclination that nothing could 
oppose me ; on the other hand, my wife bein^ dead, nobody con- 
cerned themselves" so much for me as to persuade me to one way or 
the other, except my ancient good friend the widow, who earnestly 
struggled witli,me to consider my years, my easy circumstances, and 
the needless hazards of a long voyage ; and, above all, my young 
children. But it was all to no purpose ; I had an irresistible desire 
for the voyage ; and I told her I thought there was something so un- 
common in the impressions I had upon my mind that it would be a 
kind of resisting Providence if I should attempt to stay at home ; 
after which she ceased her expostulations, and joined with me, not 
only in making provision for my voyage, but also in settling my 
family affairs for my absence and providing for the education of 
my children. 

In order to do this I made my will, and settled the estate I had in 
such a manner for my children, and placed in such hands that I was 
perfectly easy and satisfied they would have justice done them, 
whatever might befall me : and for their education, I left it wholly 
to the widow, with a sufficient maintenance to herself for her care ; 
all which she richly deserved ; for no mother could have taken more 
care in their education, or understood it better : and as she lived till 
I came home, I also lived to thank her for it. 

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of January, 
1694r^ ; and I, with my man Friday, went on board, m the Downs, 
the 8th ; having, besides that sloop, which I mentioned above, a 
very considerable cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my col- 
ony ; which if I did not find in good condition 1 resolved to leave so. 

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I purposed to place 
there as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there, upon my ac- 
count, while I staid, and either to leave them there or carry them 
forward, as they should appear willing : particularly I carried two 
carpenters, a smith, and a very handy, ingenious fellow, who was a 
cooper by trade, and was also a general mechanic : for he was dex- 
terous at making wheels, and hand mills to grind com, was a good 
turner and a good pot-maker ; he also made anything that was prop- 
er to make of earth or of wood ; in a word, we called Mm our Jack- 
of -all -trades. With these I carried a tailor, who had offered himself 
to go a passenger to the East Indies with my nepiiew, but afterward 
consented to slay on our new plantation ; and who proved a most

necessary, haody fellow as could be desired, in many other businesses 
besides liiat of his trade ; for, as I observed formerly, necessity arms 
us for all employments. 

My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not kept account 
of the particulars, consisted of a sufficient quantity of linen and 
some English thin stuffs, for clothing the Spaniards that I expected 
to find there ; and enough of them as by my calculation might com- 
fortably supply them for seven years ; if I remember right, the 
mateiials I carried for clothing them, with gloves, hats, shoes, stock- 
ings, and all such things as they could want for wearing, amounted 
to above two Jiundred pounds, including some beds, bedding, and 
household stuff, particularly kitchen utensils, with pots, kettles, pew- 
ter, brass, etc., and near a hundred pounds more in iron -work, nails, 
tools of every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every necessary thing 
I could think of. 

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and fusees ; besides 
some pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes, three or 
four tons of lead, and two pieces of brass cannon ; and, because I 
knew not what time and what extremities I was providin/i: for, I car- 
ried a hundred barrels of powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and the 
iron pail; of some pikes and halberds ; so that, in short, we had a 
large magazine of all sorts of stores : and I made my nephew (^rry 
two small quarter-deck guus more than he wanted for his ship, to 
leave behind if there was occasion ; that when we came there wo 
might build a fort and man it against all sorts of enemies : and, in- 
de^, I at first thought there would be need enough for all, and 
much more, if we hoped to maintain our possession of the island ; as 
shall be seen in the course of that story. 

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used to meet 
with ; and therefore shall have the less occasion to interrupt the 
reader, who, perhaps, may be impatient tf> hear how matters went 
with my colony : yet some odd accidents, cross winds, and bad 
weather happened on this first setting out, which made the voyage 
longer than I expected it at first ; and I, who had never made but one 
voyage, my first voyage to Guinea, in which I might be said to come 
bactk again, as the voyage was at first designed, began to think the 
same iu fate attended me, and that I was born to be never contented 
with being on shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at sea. 

Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and we were obliged 
to put in at Galway in Ireland, where we lay wind-bound two-and- 
twenty days ; but we had this satisfaction with the disaster, that 
provisions were here exceeding cheap and in the utmost plenty ; so 
that while we lay here, we never touched th€ ship*s stores, but rather 
added to them. Here also I took in several live hogs and two 
cows with their calves, which I resolved, if I had a good passage, to 
put on shore in my island : but we found occasion to diaposo other- 
wIm of them. 



ROBIKSON CRUSOE. 217 

We set out on the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a very 
fair gale of wind for some days. As I remember, it might be about 
the 20th of February, in the evening late, when the mate, having 
the watch, came into the roundhouse and told us he saw a flash of 
3re and heard a gun fired ; and wliile he was telling us of it a boy 
came in and told us the boatswain heard another. iThis made us all 
run out upon the quarter-deck, whe e for a while we heard nothing ; 
but in a few minutes we saw a very great light, and found that there 
was some very terrible fire at a distance ; immediately we had re- 
course to our reckonings, in whi^h we all agreed that there could be 
no land that way in which the fire showed itself, no, not for five hun- 
dred leagues, for it appeared at W.N.W. Upon this we con- 
cluded it must be some ship on fire at sea ; and as, by our hearing 
the noise of guns just before, we concluded that it could not be far 
off, we stood directly toward it, and were presently satisfied we 
should discover it, .because the farther we sailed the greater the light 
appeared ; though, the weather bein^ hazy, we could not perceive 
anything but the light for a while. In about half an hour's sailing, 
the wind being fair for us, though not much of it, and tiie weather 
clearing up a little, we could plamly discern that it was a great ship 
on fire m the fiiiddle of the sea. 

I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at all 
acquainted with the persons engaged in it : I presently recollected 
my former circumstances and what condition I was in when taken 
up by the Portuguese captain, and how much more deplorable the 
circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to that ship must be, 
if they had no other ship in company with them. Upon this I im- 
mediately ordered that five guns should be fired, one soon after an- 
other, that, if possible, we might give notice to them that there was 
help for them at hand, and that they might endeavor to save them- 
selves in their boat ; for though we could see the fiames of the ship, 
yet they, it being night, could see nothing of us. 

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning ship 
drove, waiting for daylight ; when, on a sudden, to our great terror, 
though we had reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the air, and 
immediately, that is to say, in a few minutes, all the fire was out, that 
is to say, the rest of the ship sunk. This was a terrible, and, indeed, 
an afflicting sight, for the sake of the poor men, who, I concluded, 
must be either all destroyed in the ship or be in the utmost distress 
in their boat, in the middle of the ocean ; which, at present, as it was 
dark, I couhi not see. However, to direct them as well as I could, I 
caused lights to be hung out in all the parts of the ship where we 
could, and which we had lanterns for, and kept firing guns all the 
night long ; letting them know by this that there was a ship not far 
off. 

About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered the ship's boats 
by the help of our perfective-glasses, and found there were two of 



■■ f IE_ 



218 



EOBINSON CRUSOE. 



them, both thronged with people and deep in the water. We per- 
ceived they rowed, the wind being against them ; that they saw our 
ship and did their utmost to make us see them. 

We immediately spread our ancient, to let them know we saw 
them, and hung a waft out, as a signal for them to come on board ; 
and then made more sail, standing directly to them. In little more 
than half an hour we came up with them ; and, in a word, took them 
all in, being no less than sixty-four men, women, and children ; for 
there were a great many passengers. 

Upon inquiry we found it was a French merchant ship of three 
hundred tons, home bound from Quebec, in the river of Canada. 
The master gave us a long account of the distress of his ship ; how 
the fire began in the steerage, by thQ negligence of the steersman ; 
but, on his crying out for help, was, as everybody thought, entirely 
put out ; but they soon found that some sparks of the first fire had 
got into some part of the ship so difficult to come at that they could 
not effectually quench it ; and afterwanl getting in between (he 
timbers, and within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded into the 
hold and mastered all the skill and all the application they were able 
to exert. 

They had no more to do then but to get into their boats, which, 
to their great comfort, were pretty large ; being their long-boat and 
a great shallop, besides a small skiff, which was of no great service to 
them other than to get some fresh water and provisions into her, after 
they hafl secured their lives from the fire. They had, indeed, small 
hope of their lives by getting into these boats, at that distance from 
any land : only, as they said, that they thus escaped from the fire, 
and there was a possibility that some ship might happen to be at sea 
and might take them in. They had sails, oars, and a compass, and 
were preparing to make the best of their way back to Newfoundland, 
the wind blowing pretty fair, for it blew an easy gale at S.E. by E. 
They had as much provision and water as, with sparing it, so 
as to be next door to starving, might support them about twelve 
days, in which, if they had no had weather and no contrary winds, 
the captain said he hoped he might get to the Banks of Newfound- 
land, and might perhaps take some fish, to sustain them till they 
might go on shore. But there were so many chances against them 
in all these cases, such as storms, to overset and founder them ; rains 
and cold, to benumb and pensh their limbs ; contrai-y winds, to keep 
them out and starve them ; that it must have been next to miracu- 
lous if thejr had escaped. 

In the midst of their consternation, every one being hopeless and 
ready to despair, the captain, with tears in his eyes, told me they 
were on a sudden surprised with the joy of hearing a gun fire, and 
after that four more : these were the five guns which I caused to be 
fired at first seeing the light. This revived their hearts and gave 
them the notice, which as above I desired it should, that there was a 



EOBINSON CRUSOE. 219 

ship at hand for their help. It was upon the hearing of these guns 
that they took down their masts and sails : the sound coming from 
the windward they resolved to lie by till morning. Some time after 
this, hearing no more guns, they fired three muskets, one a consider- 
able while after another ; but these, the wind being contrary, we 
never heard. 

Some time after that again they were still more agreeably surprise;! 
with seeing our lights and hearing the guns which, as I have said, I 
caused to be fired all the rest of the night. This set them to work 
with their oars, to keep their boats ahead, at least, that we might the 
sooner come up with them ; and, at last, to their inexpressible joy, 
they found we saw them. 

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the strange 
ecstasies, the variety of postures, which these poor delivered people 
ran into, to express the joy of their souls at so unexpected a deliver- 
ance. Grief and fear are easilv described ; sighs, tears, groans, and 
a very few motions of the head and hands, make up the sum of its 
variety ; but an excess of joy, a surprise of joy, has a thousand ex- 
travagances in it. There were some in tears ; some raging and tear- 
ing themselves, as if they had been in the greatest agonies of sor- 
row ; some stark raving and downright lunatic ; some ran about the 
ship stamping with their feet, others wringing their hands ; some 
were dancing, some singing, some laughing, more crying, many 
quite dumb, not able to speak a word ; others sick and vomiting ; 
several swooning and ready to faint ; and a few were crossing tliem- 
selves and giving God thanks. 

I would not wrong them either ; there might be many that were 
thankful afterward ; but the passion was too strong for them at first, 
and they were not able to master it ; they were thrown into ecsta- 
sies and a kind of frenzy, and it was but a very few that were com- 
posed and serious in their joy. 

Perhaps, also, the case may have some addition to it from the par- 
ticular circumstance of that nation they belonged to ; I mean the 
French, whose temper is allowed to be more volatile, more passion- 
ate, and more sprightly, and their spirits more fluid than in other 
nations. I am not philosopher enough to determine the cause ; but 
nothing I had ever seen before came up' to it. The ecstasies poor 
Friday, my trusty savage, was in, when he found his father in the 
boat, came the nearest to it ; and the surprise of the master and his 
two companions, whom I delivered from the villains that set them 
on shore in the island, came a little way towai*d it ; but nothing 
was to compare to this, either that I saw in Friday or anywhere 
else in my life. 

It is further observable that these extravagances did not show 
themselves in that different manner I have mentioned, in different 
persons only ; but all the variety would appear, in a short succession 
of moments, in one and the same person. A man that we saw this 



I 



220 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid and confounded, would the 
next minute be dancing and hallooing like an antic, and the next 
moment be tearing his hair, or pulling his clothes to pieces and 
stamping them under his feet like a n^man ; in a few moments 
after that we would have him all in tears, then sick, swo(»ning, and, 
had not inmiediate help been had, he would in a few moments have 
been dead ; and thus it was, not with one or two, or ten or twenty, 
but with the greatest part of them ; and, if I reott^mber right, our 
surgeon was obliged to let blood of about thirty of theuL 

There were two priests among them ; one an old man and the 
other a young man ; and that which was strangest was, the oldest 
man was the worst. As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, 
and saw himself safe, he dropped down stone dead to all appearance ; 
not the least sign of life could be perceived in him : our surgeon im- 
mediately applied proper remedies to recover him, and was the only 
man in the ship that believed he was not dead. At length he opened 
a vein in his arm, having first chafed and rubbed the part so 'as to 
warm it as much as possible. Upon this the blood, which only drop- 
ped at first, flowing freely, in three minutes after the man opened 
his eyes ; and a quarter of an hour after that he spoke, ^rew better, 
and in a little time quite well. After the blood was stopped, he 
walked about, told us he was perfectly well, took a dram of cordial 
which the surgeon gave him, and had come to himself. About a 
quarter of an hour after this they came running into the cabin to 
the surgeon, who was bleeding a French woman that had fainted, 
and told him the priest was gone stark mad. It seems he had begun 
to revolve the change of his circumstances in his mind, and again 
this put him into an ecstasy of joy. Uis spirits whirled about faster 
than the vessels could convey them, the blood grew hot and fever- 
ish ; and the man was as fit for Bedlam as any creature that ever 
was in it. The surgeon would not bleed him again in that con- 
dition, but gave him something to doze and put him to sleep ; which, 
after some time, operated upon him, and he awoke next morning per- 
fectly composed and well. 

The younger priest behaved with great command of his passions, 
and was really an example of a serious, well governed mind. After 
his first coming on board the ship he threw himself flat on his face, 
prostrating himself in thankfulness for his deliverance, in which I 
unhappily and unseasonably disturbed him, really thinking he had 
been in a swoon ; but he spoke calmly, thanked me, told me he was 
giving God thanks for his deliverance, begged me to leave him a few 
moments, and that, next to his Maker, he would give me thanks 
also. 

I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not only left him, 
but kept others from interrupting him also. He continued in that 
posture about three minutes, or little more, after I left him. then 
came to me, as he had said he would, and with a great deal of seri- 



_iL^ 



ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 221 

ousness and affection, but with tears in his eyes, thanked me, that 
had, under (jk>d, ^iven him and so many miserable creatures their 
lives. I told him I had lio need to tell him to thank God for it rather 
than me, for I had seen that he had done that already : but J added 
that it was nothing but what reason and humanity dictated to all 
men, and that we had as much reason as he to give thanks to God, 
who had blessed us so far as to make us the instruments of his mercy 
lo so many of his creatures. 

After this the young priest applied himself .to his countrymen ; 
labored to compose them ; persuaded, entreated, argue<l, reasoned 
with tfjem, and did his utmost to keep them within the exercise of 
their reason ; and with some he had success, though others were for 
a time out of all government of themselves. 

I cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may be 
useful to those into whose hands it may fall, for guiding themselves 
in the extravagances of their passions ; for if an excess of joy can 
carry men out to such a length beyond the reach of their reason, 
what will not the extravagances of anger, rage, and a provoked mind, 
carry us to ? And, indeed, here I saw reason for keeping an exceed- 
ing watch over our passions of every kind, as well those of joy and 
satisfaction as those of sorrow and anger. 

We were somewhat disordered by these extravagances among our 
new guests, for the first day ; but after they had retired to lodgings 
provided for them as well as our ship would allow, an»l they had 
slept heartily — as most of them did, being fatigued and frightened — 
they were quite another sort of people the next day. 

Nothing of good manners or civil acknowledgments for the kind- 
ness shown them was wanting ; the French, it is known, are 
naturally apt enough to exceed that way. The captain and one of 
the priests came to me the next day and desired to speak with me 
and my nephew ; the commander begiin to consult with us what 
should be done with them ; and, first, they told us we had saved 
their lives ; so all they had was little enough for a return to us for 
that kindness received. The captain said they had saved some money 
and some things of value in their boats, caught hastily out of the 
flames, and if we would accept it they were ordered to make an 
offer of it all to us ; they only desired to be set on shore somewhere 
in our way, where, if possible, they might get a passage to France. 
My nephew wished to accept their money at first word, and to con- 
siaer what to do with them afterward ; but 1 overruled him in that 
part, for I knew what it was to be set on shore in a strange country ; 
and if the Portuguese captain that took me up at sea had served me 
so, and taken all I had for my deliverance, I must have starved, or 
have been as much a slave at the Brazils as 1 had been at Barbary, 
the mere being sold to a Mahometan excepted ; and perhaps a Por- 
tuguese is not a much better master than a Turk, if not, in some 
cases, much worse. 



222 ROBIKSON CUUSOE. 

I therefore told the French captain that we had taken them up in 
their distress, it was true, but that it was our duty to do so, as we 
were fellow-creatures ; and we would desire to be so delivered if 
we were in the like or any other extremity ; that we had done noth- 
ing for Ihem but what we believed they would have done for us, If 
we had been in their case and they in ours ; but that we took them 
up to save them, not to plunder them ; and it would be a most bar- 
barous thing to take that little from them which they had saved out 
of the fire, and then set them on shore and leave them ; that this would 
be first to save them from death and then kill them ourselves ; save 
them from drowning and abandon them to starving ; and, therefore, 
I would not let the least thing be taken from them. As to setting 
them on shore, I told them, indeed, that was -an exceeding difficidty 
to us, for that the ship was bound to the East Indies ; and though 
we were driven out of our course to the westward a very great way, 
and perhaps were directed by Heaven on purpose for flieir deliver- 
ance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to change our voyage on 
their particular account ; nor could my nephew, the captain, answer 
it to the freighters, with whom he was under charter to pursue his 
voyage by way of Brazil ; and all I knew we could do for them was 
to put ourselves in the way of meeting with other ships homeward 
bound from the West Indies, and get them a passage, if possible, to 
England or France. 

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind they could 
not but be very thankful for it ; but they were in very great conster- 
nation, especially the passengers, at the notion of being carried away 
to the Eagt Indies ; they then entreated me, that as I was driven so 
far to the westward before I met with them, I would at least keep 
on the same course to the Banks of Newfoundland, where it was prob- 
able I might meet with some ship or sloop that they might hire to 
carry them back to Canada, from whence they came. 

I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part, and 
therefore I inclined to agree to it ; for, indeed, I considered that to 
carry this whole company to the East Indies would not only be an 
intolerable severity upon the poor people, but would be ruining our 
whole voyage, by devouring all our provisions ; so I thought it no 
breach of charter-party but what an unforeseen accident made abso- 
lutely necessary to us, and in which no one could say we were to 
blame ; for the laws of God and nature would have forbid that we 
should refuse to take up two boats full of people in such a distressed 
condition ; and the nature of the thing, as well respecting ourselves as 
the poor people, obliged us to set them on shore somewhere or other 
for their deliverance. So I consented that we would carry them to 
Newfoundland, if wind and weather would permit ; and if not, that 
I wduld carry them to Marlinioo, in the West Indies. 

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty good ; 
and as the winds had continued in the points between N.E. and S.£l 



ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 22S 

a long time, we missed several opportunities of sending them to 
France ; for we met several ships bound to Europe, whereof two 
were French, from St. Christopher's ; but they had been so long 
beating up against the wind that they durst take in no passengers, 
for fear of wanting provisions for the voyage as well for themselves 
as for those they should take in ; so we were obliged to go on. It 
was about a week after this that we made the Bai\ks of Newfound- 
land ; where, to shorten my story, we put all our French people on 
board a bark, which they hired at sea there, to put them on shore, 
and afterward to carry them to France, if they could get provisions 
to victual themselves with. When I say all the French went on 
shore, 1 should remember that the young priest 1 spoke of, hearing 
we were bound to the East Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, 
and to be set on shore on the coast of Coromandel ; which I readily 
agreed to, for I wonderfullv liked the man, and had very good rea- 
son, as will appear afterward ; also four of the seamen entered 
themselves on our ship, and proved veiy useful fellows. 

From hence we directed our course tor the West Indies, steering 
away 8. and S. by E. for about twenty days together, sometimes 
little or no wind at all ; when we met with another subject for our 
humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable as that before. 

It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes north, on the 19th 
day of March, 1694-5, when we spied a sail, our course S.E. and 
by S. We soon perceived it was a large vessel, and that she bore up 
to us, but could not at first know what to make of her, till, after 
coming a little nearer, we found she had lost her main-topmast, 
foremast, and bowsprit ; and presently she fired a gun as a signal of 
distress. The weather was pretty good, wind atJN.N.W., a fresh 
gale, and we soon came to speak with her. 

We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, but 
had been blown out of the road at Barbadoes a few days before she 
was ready to sail, by a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief 
mate were both gone on shore ; so that, besides the terror of tho 
stormy they were m an indifferent case for good artists to bring the 
ship home. They had been already, nine weeks at sea, and had met 
with another terrible storm, after the hurricane was over, which had 
blown them quite out of their knowledge to the westward, and in 
which they lost their masts. They tola us they expected to have 
seen the Bahama Islands, but were then driven away again to the 
south-east, by a strong gale of wind at N.N.W., the same that 
blew now ; and having no sails to work the ship with but a main 
course, and a kind of square sail upon a jury-foremast, which they 
had set up, they could not lie near the wind, but were endeavoring 
to stand away lor the Canaries. 

But that which was worst of all was that they were almost 
starved for want of provisions, besides the fatigues they had under- 
gone : their bread and flesh were quite gone ; they had not one 



i 

I 



224 ROBINSON CRUSOE, 

ounce left in the £hip, and had had none for eleven days. The only 
relief they had was, their water was nut all spent, and they haa 
about half a barrel of flour left ; they had sugar enough ; some suc- 
cades, or sweetmeats, they had at tirst^but they were all devoured ; 
and they had seven casks of rum. 

There was a youth and his mother and a maid-servant on board, 
who were passengers, and thinking the ship was ready to sail, un- 
happily came on board the evening btfore the hurricane began ; and 
having no provisions of their own left, they were in a more deplora- 
ble condition than the rest : for the seamen, being reduced to such 
an extreme necessity themselves, had no companion, we may be 
sure, for the poor passengers ; and they were, indeed, in such a con- 
dition that their naisery is very hard to describe. 

I had perhaps not known this part if my curiosity had not led me 
(the weather being fair, and the wind abated) to go on board the 
ship. The second mate, who upon this occasion comnmnded the 
ship, had been on board ourship, and he told me they had three pas- 
sengers in the great cabin that were in a deplorable condition. 
** iCay,'* says he, "I believe they are dead, for I have heard nothing 
of them for above two days : and 1 was afraid to inquire after 
them," said he, " for I had nothing to relieve them with." 

We immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief we 
could spare ; and, indeed, I had so far ovemiled things with my 
nephew that 1 would have victualled them, though we had gone 
away to Virginia, or any other part of the coast of America, to have 
supplied ourselves ; but thei*e was no necessity for that. 

But now they were in a new danger ; for Ihey were afraid of eat- 
ing too nauch, even of that little we gave them. The mate, or com- 
mander, brought six men with him in his boat ; but these poor 
wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak that they could 
hardly sit to their oars. The mate himself was very ill and half 
starved ; for he declared he had reserved nothing from the men, and 
went share and share alike with them in every bit they ate. 

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set naeat before him immedi- 
ately ; and he had not eaten three mouthf lils before he began to be 
sick and out of order ; so he stopped awhile, and our surgeon mixed 
him up something with some broth, which he said woulu be to him 
both food and physic ; and after he had taken it he grew belter. In 
the mean time I forgot not the men ; I ordered victuals to be given 
them, and the poor creatures rather devoured than ate it : tliey were 
so exceedingly hungry that they were in a manner ravenous, and had 
no command of themselves ; and two of them ate with so much 
greediness that they were in danger of their lives the next morning. 

The sight of these people's distress was very moving to me, and 
brought to mind what I had a terrible prospect of at my first coming 
on shore in my island, where I had never the least mouthful of food,

I had of bein^ wkBfe Tne food of other creatures. But all the while 
the mate was thus relating to me the miserable condition of the ship's 
company, I could not put out of my thought the story he had told 
me of the three poorcreatures in the great cabin, viz., the mother, 
her son, and the mam-servant, whom he had heard nothing of for 
two or three days, and whom, he seemed to confess, they had wholly 
neglected, their own extremities being so great ; by which I under- 
stood that they had really given them 'no food at all, and that there- 
fore they must be perished, and be all lying dead, perhaps, on the 
floor or deck of the cabin. 

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain, on board 
with his men, to refresh tbem, so I also forgot not the starving crew 
that were left on board ; but ordered my own boat to go on board 
the ship, and, with my mate and twelve men, to carry them a sack of 
bread and four or five pieces of beef to boil. Our surgeon charged 
the men to cause the meat to be boiled while they staid, and to keep 
guard in the cook-room, to prevent thf5 men taking it to eat raw, or 
taking it out of the pot before it was well boiled, and then to give 
every man but a very little at a time : and by this caution ho pre- 
served the men, who would otherwise have killed themselves with 
that very food that was given them on purpose to save their 
lives. 

At the same time I ordered the mate to go into ^the great cabin 
and see what condition the poor passengers were in ; and if they 
were alive, to comfort them, and give them what refreshment was 
proper : and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher, with some of the 
prepared broth which he had given the mate that was on board, and 
which he did not question would restore them gradually. 

I was not satisfied with this : but, as I said above, having a great 
mind to see the scene of misery which I knew the ship itself would 
present me with, in a more lively manner than I could have it by re- 
port, I took the captain of the ship, as we now called him, with me, 
and went myself, a little after, in their boat. 

I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult, to get the 
victuals out of the boiler before it was ready ; but my mate observed 
liis orders, and kept a good guard at the cook-room door ; and the 
man he placed there, after using all possible persuasion to have 
patience, kept them off by force : however, he caused some biscuit 
cakes to be dipped in the pot, and softened with the liquor of the 
meat, which they called brewis, and gave them every one some, to 
stay their stomachs, and told them it was for their own safety that 
he was obliged to give them but little at a time. But it was all in 
vain ; and had I not come on board, and their own commander and 
oflfeeis with me, and with good words, and some threats also of giv- 
ing them no more, I believe they would have broken into the cook- 
room by force, and torn the meat out of the furnace ; for words are 
indeed of very small force to a hungry belly • however, we pacified

them, and fed them gradually and cautiously for the first, and the 
next time gave them more, and at last filled their bellies, and the 
men did well enough. 

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of another 
nature, and far beyond the rest ; for as, first, ^he shift's company 
had so little for themselves, it was but too true that they bad at first 
kept them very low, and at last totally neglected Ihem : so that for 
six or seven days it might be said they had really no food at all, and 
for several days before very little. The poor mother, who, as the 
men reported, was a woman of sense and good breeding, had spared 
all she could so affectionately for her son, that at last she entirely 
sank under it ; and when the mate of our ship went in, she sat upon 
the floor or deck, with her back up against the sides, between two 
chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head sunk between her shoul- 
ders, like a corpse, though not quite dead. My mate said all he could 
to revive and encourage her, and with a spoon put some broth into 
her mouth. She opened her lips, and lifted up. one hand, but could 
not speak : yet she understood what he said, and made signs to him, 
intimating that it was too late for her, but pointed to her child, as 
if she would have said they should take care of him. However, the 
mate, who .was exceedingly moved at the sight, endeavored to get 
some of the broth into her mouth, and, as he said, got two or three 
spoonfuls down ; though 1 question whether he could be sure of it 
or not ; but it was too late, and she died the same night. 

The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most affectionate 
mother's life, was not so far gone ; yet he lay in a cabin bed, as one 
stretched out, with hardly any life left in him. He had a piece of an 
old glove in his mouth, having eaten up the rest of it : however, be- 
ing young, and having more strength than his mother, the mate got 
something down his throat, and he began sensibly to revive ; though 
by giving him, some time after, but two or three spoonfuls extradrai- 
nary, he was very sick, and brougbt it up again. 

But the next care was the poor maid : she lay all along upon the 
deck, hard by her mistress, and just like one that nad fallen down 
with an apoplexy, and struggled for life. Her limbs were distorted ; 
one of her hands was clasped round the frame of the chair, and she 
gripped it so hard that we could not easily make her let it go ; her 
other arm lay over her heud, and her feet lay both together, set fast 
against the frame of the cabin table : in short, she lay just like one in 
the agonies of death, and yet she was alive too. 

The poor creature was not only starved with hunger and terrified 
with the thoughts of death, but, as the men told us afterward, was 
broken-hearted for her mistress, whom sht saw dying for two or three 
days before, and whom she loved most tenderly. 

We knew not what to do with this poor girl ; for when our sur- 
geon, who was a man of very great knowledge and experience, had, 
with great application, recovered her as to life, he had her upon hia

hands still ; for she was little less than distracted for a considerable 
time after. 

Wlioever shall read these memorandums must be desired to con- 
sider that visits at sea are not like a journey into the country, where 
sometimes people stay a week or a fortnight at a place : our business 
was to relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not lie by for them ; 
and though they were willing to steer the same course with us for 
some days, yet we could carry no sail to keep pace with a ship that 
had no masts : however, as their captain begged of us to help him lo 
set up a maiu-topmast, and a kind of a topmast to his jury-foremast, 
we did, as it were, lie by him for three or four days ; and then, 
liaving given him five barrels of beef, a ban*el of pork, two hogs- 
heads of biscuit, and a proportion of peas, flour, and what other 
things we could spare ; and taking three casks of sugar, some rum, 
and some pieces-of-eight from them for satisfaction, we left them, 
taking on board with us, at their own earnest request, the youth and 
the maid, and all their goods. 

The young lad was about seventeen years of age ; a pretty, well- 
bred, modesf, and sensible youth, greatly delected with the loss of 
his mother, and, as it seems, he had lost his father but a few months 
before at Barbadoes : he begged of the surgeon to speak to me to 
take him out of the ship ; for he sail the cruel fellows had murdered 
his mother : and, indeed, so they had, that is to say, passively ; for 
thev might have spared a small sustenance to the poor, helpless 
widow, that might have preserved her life, though it had been but just 
enough to keep her alive ; but hunger knows no friend, no relation, no 
justice, no right, and therefore is remorseless and capable of no 
compassioo. 

The surgeon told him how far we were going, and that it would 
carry him away from all his friends, and put him, perhaps, in as bad 
circumstances almost as those we found him in — Uiat is to say, starv- 
ing in the world. He said it mattered not whither he went, if he 
Was but delivered from the terrible crew that he was among ; that 
the captain (by which he meant me, for he could know nothing of 
my nephew) had saved his life, and he was sure would not hurt him ; 
and as for the maid, he was sure, .if she came to herself, she would 
be very thankful for it, let us carry them where we would. The 
surgeon represented the case so affectionately to me that I yielded, 
ana we took them both on board, with all their goods, except eleven 
hogsheads of sugar, which could not be removed or come at ; and as 
the youth had a bill of lading for them, I made his commander sign 
a writing, obliging himself to go, as soon as he came to Bristol, to 
one Mr. Rogers, a merchant there, to whom the youth said he was 
related, and to deliver a letter which I wrote to him, and all the 
goods he had belonging to the deceased widow ; which I suppose 
was not done, for 1 could never learn that the ship came to Bristol, 
but was, as is most probable, lost at sea ; being in so disabled a con*

dition and so far from any land that I am of opinion the first storm 
she met witli afterward she might founder in the sea, for she was 
leaky, and had damage in her hol(i, when we met witli her. 

I was now in the latitude of 19 degrees 82 minutes, and had hith- 
erto a tolerable voyage as to weather, though at first the winds had 
been contrary. I shall trouble nobody with the little incidents of 
wind, weather, currents, etc., on the rest of our voyage ; but, to 
shorten my story, shall observe that I came to my old habitation, the 
island, on the 10th of AprU, 1695. It was with no small difficulty 
that I found the place ; for as I came to it, and went from it, before, 
on the south and. east side of the island, coming from the Brazils, so 
now, coming in between the main and the island, and having no 
chart for the coast, nor any landmark, I did not know it when I saw 
it, or know whether I saw it or not. 

"We beat about a great while, and went on shore on several islands 
in the mouth of the great River Oronooque, but none for my pur- 
pose ; only this I learned by my coasting the shore, that I was under 
one great mistake before, viz., that the continent which I thought I 
saw from the island I lived in was really no continent, but a long 
island, or rather a ridge of islands, reaching from one to the other 
side of the extended mouth of that great river ; and that the savages 
who came to my island 'were not properly those which we call Canb- 
Ifees, but islanders, and other barbarians of the same kind, who in- 
habited nearer to our side than the rest. 

In short, I visited several of these islands to no purpose ; some I 
found were inhabited, and some were not : on one of them I found 
some Spaniards, and thought they had lived there ; but, speaking 
with them, found they had a sloop lying in a small creek hard by, 
and came thither to make salt, and to catch some pearl mussels if 
they could ; but that they belonged to the Isle de Trinidad, which 
lay farther north, in thie latitude of 10 and 11 degrees. 

Thus coasting from one island to another, sometimes with the ship, 
sometimes with the Frenchmen's shallop, which we had found a con- 
venient boat, and therefore kept her with their very good will, at 
length I came fair on the south side of my island, and presently 
knew the very countenance of the place : so I brought the £hip sate 
to an anchor, broadside with the little creek where my old habitation 
was. 

As soon as I saw the place I called for Friday, and asked him if 
he knew where he was? He looked about a little, and presently 
clapping his hands, cried, ** O yes, O there, O yes, O there !** point- 
ing to our old habitation, and fell dancing and capering like a mad 
fellow ; and I had much ado to keep him from jumping into the sea, 
to swim ashore to the place. 

** Well, Friday," says I, " do you think we shall find anj'body here 
or no? and do you think we shall see your father?" The fellow 
Stood mute as a stock a good while ; but when I ni^ned his father 



EOBINSOK CRUSOE. 229 

the poor affectionate crenture looked dejected, and I could see the 
tears run down his face very plentifully. ** What is the matter, Fri- 
day?" says I; "are you troubled because you may see your 
father?*' *lNo, no," s^ys he, shaking his head, ** no see him more : 
no, never more see him again." ** Why so," said I, *' Friday ? how 
do you know that?" ** O no, O no,'** says Friday, "he long ago 
die, long ago ; he much old man." ** WeU, well," says I, ** Friday, 
you don't know ; but shall we see any one else, then ?" The fellow, 
it seems, had better'eyes than I, and he points to the hill just above 
my old house ; and though we lay half a league off, he cries out, 
** We see, we see, yes, yes, we see much man there, and there, and 
there." I looked, but I saw nobody — no, not with a perspective- 
glass, which was, I suppose, because I could not hit the place ; for 
the fellow was right, as I found upon inquiry the next day ; and 
thete were five or six men all together, who stood to look at the ship, 
not knowing what to think of us. 

As soon as Friday told me- he saw people, I caused the English an- 
cient to be spread and fired three guns, to give them notice we were 
friends; ana in about a quarter of an hour after we perceived a smoke 
arise from the side of the creek ; so I immediately ordered the boat 
out, taking Friday with me ; and, hanging out a white flag, or a flag 
Qf truce, I went directly on shore, taking with me the young friar i 
mentioned, to whom I had told the story of my living there, and the 
manner of it, and every particular, both of myself and those I left 
there, and who was, on that account, extremely desirous to go with 
me. We had, besides, about sixteen men well armed, if we had 
found any new guests there which we did not know of ; but we had 
no need of weapons. 

As we went on shofe upon the tide of flood, near high water, we 
rowed directly into the creek ; and the first man I fixed my eye upon 
was the Spaniard whose life I had saved, and whom I knew by his 
face perfectly well : as to his habit, I shall describe it afterward. I 
ordered nobody to ^o on shore at first but myself ; but there was no 
keeping Friday in the boat, for the affectionate creature had spied 
his father at a distance, a good way off the Spaniards, where, indeed, 
I saw nothing of him ; and if they had not let him go ashore he 
would have jumped into the sea. He was no sooner on shore but he 
flew away to his father, like an arrow out of a bow. It would have 
made any man shed tears, in spite of the firmest resolution, to have 
seen -the first transports of this poor fellow's joy when he came to his 
father ; how he embraced him, kissed him, stroked his face, took him 
' up in his arms, set Jiim down upon a tree, and lay down by him ; 
then stood and looked at him, as any one would look at a strange 
picture, for a (quarter of an hour together, then lay down on the 
ground and stroked his legs, and kissed them, and then got up 
again and stared at him ; one would have thought the fellow be- 
witched. But it would have made a dog laugh the next day to see 



i. ' .^ 



230 ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 

how his passion ran out another way : in the morning he walked 
along the shore with his father several hours, always leading him 
by the hand, as if he had been a lady ; and every now and then he 
would come to the boat to fetcli something or other for him, either a 
lump of su^ar, a dram, a biscuit cake, or something or other that 
was good. In the afternoon his frolics ran another way ; for then he 
would set the old man down upon the ground, and dance about him, 
and make a thousand antic postures and gestures ; and all the while he 
did this he would be talking to him, and telling him one story or an- 
other of his travels, and of what had happened to him abroad, to 
divert him. In short, if the same filial affection was to be found in 
Christians to their parents, in our part of the world, one would be 
tempted to say there would hardly have been any need of the fifth 
commandment. 

But this is a digression : I return to my landing. It would be 
needless to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities that the 
Spaniards received me with. The first Spaniard, whom, as I said, I 
knew very well, was he whose life I had saved. He came toward 
the boat, attended by one more, carrying a flag of truce also ; and he 
not only did not know me at first, but he had no thoughts, no notion 
of its being me that was come, till I spoke to him. " Seignior,'* said 
I; in Portuguese, ** do you nut know me ?" At which he spoke not 
a word, but, giving his musket to the man that was with him, threw 
his arms abroad, saying something in Spanish that I did net perfectly 
hear, came forward and embracea me, telling me he was ineAcusable 
not to know that face again that he had once seen as if an angel from 
heaven, sent to save his life : he said abundance of very handsome 
things, as a well-bred Spaniard always knows how ; and then, beckon-* 
ing to the person that attended him, bade him go and call out his 
comrades. He then asked me if I would walk to my old habitation, 
where he would give me possession of my own house again, and 
where I should see they had made but mean improvements : so I 
walked along with him ; but alas I I could no more find the place 
than if I had never been there ; for they had planted so many trees, 
and placed them in such a position, so liiick and close to one another, 
and in ten years' time they were grown so big, that, in short, the 
place was inaccessible, except by such windings and blind ways as 
they themselves only, who made them, could find. 

I asked them what put them upon all these fortifications : he told 
me I would say there was need enough of it, when they had given 
me an account how they had passed their time since their arriving in 
the island, especially after they had the misfortune to find that I was . 
gone. He told me he could not but have some satisfaction in my 
good fortune, when he heard that I was gone in a good ship, and to 
my satisfaction ; and that he had oftentimes a strong pci suasion that 
one time or other he should see me again ; but nothing that ever be- 
fell him in his life, he said, was so surprising and afilicling to bim at 



ROBIKSON CEUSOE. 231 

first, as the disappointment he was under when he came back to the 
island and found I was not there. 

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left behind, 
and of whom, he said, he had a long story to tell me, the Spaniards all 
thought themselves much better among the savages, only that their 
number was so small. **And," says he, "had tliey been strong 
enough, we had been all long ago in purgatory ;" and with that he 
crossed himseiron the breast. ** But, sir," says he. **I hope you 
will not be displeased when I shall tell you how, forced by necessity, 
we were obliged, for our own preservation, to disarm them, and 
make them our subjects, as they would not be content with being 
moderately our masters, but would be our murderers. " I answered, 
I was afraid of it when I left them there, and nothing troubled me at 
my parting from the island but that they were not come back, that I 
might have put them in possession of everything first, and left the 
otliers in a slate of subjection, as they deserved ; but if they had re- 
duced them to it, I was verv glad, and should be very far from find- 
ing any fault with it ; for 1 knew they were a parcel of refractory, 
ungoverned villains, and were fit for any manner of mischief. 

While I was thus saying this, the man came whom he had sent 
back, and with him eleven more. In the dress they were in, it was 
impossible to guess what nation they were of ; but he made all clear, 
both to them and to me. First he turned to me, and pointing lb 
them, said, ** These, sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe their 
lives to you ;*' and then turning to them and pointing to me, he let 
them know who I was ; upon which they all came up, one by one, 
not as if-they had been sailors, and ordinary fellows, and the like, but 
really as if they had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a mon- 
arch or great conqueror : their behavior was, to the last degree, 
obliging and courteous, and yet mixed with a manly, majestic grav- 
ity, which very well became them ; *and, in short, they had so much 
more manners than I that I scarce knew how to receive their civil- 
ities, much less how fo return them in kind. 

The history of their coming to and conduct in the island, after my 
going away, is so very remarkable, and has so mauy incidents, 
which the fomier part of my relation will help to understand, and 
which will, in most of the particulars, refer to the account I 
have already given, that I cannot but commit them, with great de- 
light, to the reading of those that come after me. 

I shall no Ictoger trouble the story with a relation in the first per- 
son, which will put me to the expense of ten thousand *' said I's," 
and " said he's," and " he told me's," and " I told him's," and the 
like ; but I shall collect the facts historically, as near as I can gather 
them out of my memory, from what they related to me, and from 
what I met with in my conversing with them, and with the place. 

In order to do this succinctly, and as inlelligibly as I can, I must 
go back to the circumstances in which I left the island, and in which 



232 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

the persons were of whom I am to speak. And, first, it is nece sfiary 
to repeat that I had sent away Friday's father and the Spapiard (the 
two whose lives I had rescued from the savages) in a large canoe to 
the main, as I then thought il, to fetch over the Spaniard's compan- 
ions that he left ' behind him, in order to save them from the like 
calamity that he had been in, and in order to succor them for the 
present ; and that, if possible, we might together find some way for 
our deliverance afterward. 

When I sent them away, I had no visible appearance of, or the 
least room to hope for, my own deliverance, any more than I had 
twenty years before— much less had I any foreknowledge of what 
afterwara happened ; I mean, of an English ship coming on shore 
there to fetch me off ; and it could not be but a veir great surprise to 
them, when they came back, not only to find that i was gone, but lo 
find three strangers left on the spot, possessed of all that I had left 
behind me, which would otherwise have been their own. 

The first thing, however, which I inquired into, that I might begin 
where I left off, was of their own part ; and I desired the Spaniard 
would give me a particular account of his voyage back to his coun- 
trymen with the boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. He told 
me there was little variety in that part, for nothing remarkable hap- 
pened to them on the way, having had very calm weather and a 
smooth sea. As for his countrymen, it could not be doubted, he 
said, but that they were overjoyed to see him (it seems he was the 
principal man among them, the captain of the vessel they had been 
shipwrecked in having been dead some time) ; they were, he said, 
the more surprised to see him, because they knew tliat he was fallen 
into the hands of the savages, who, they were satisfied, would devour 
him, as they did all the rest of their prisoners ; that when he told 
them the story of his deliveiance, and in what manner he was fur- 
nished for carrying them away. It was like a dream to them, and 
their astonishment, he said, was somewhat like that of Joseph's 
brethren, when he told them who he was, and the story x>f his exulta- 
tion in Pharaoh's court ; but when he showed them the arms, the 
powder, the ball, and provisions, that he brought them for their jour- 
ney or voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a just share of 
the joy 01 their deliverance, and immediately prepared to come away 
with him. 

Their first business was to get canoes ; and in this they were 
obliged not to stick so much upon the honesty of it, but to trespass 
upon their friendly savages, and to borrow two large canoes, or 
periaguas, on pretence of going out a-fishing, or for pleasure. In 
these they came away the next morning. It seems they wanted no 
time to get themselves ready ; for they had no baggage, neither 
clothes, nor provisions, nor anything in the world, but what they; 
had on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they used to make 
their bread. 



KOBINSOK CRUSOE. 233 

They were, in all,. three weeks absent ; and in tliat time, unluckily 
for them, I had the occasion offered for my escape, as I mentioned 
in the other part, and to get off from the island, leaving three of the 
most impudent, hardened, ungoverhed, disagreeable villains behind 
me, that any man could desire to meet with ; to the poor Spaniard's 
great grief and disappointment, you may be sure. 

The only just thing the rogues did was, that when the Spaniards 
came ashore they gave my letter to them, and gave them provisions 
and pther relief, as I had ordered them to do ; also they gave them 
the long paper of directions which I had left with them, containing 
the particular methods which I took for managing every part of my 
life there ; the way I baked my bread, bred up tame goats, and 
planted my corn ; how I cured my grapes, made my pots, and, in a 
word, everything I did ; all this, being written down, they gave to 
the ir^paniards (two of them understood English well enough) ; nor 
did they refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with anything else, 
for they agreed very well for some time. They gave them an equal 
admission into the house, or cave, and they began to live very socia- 
bly ; and the head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my 
methods, and Friday's father together, managed all their affairs ; but 
as for the Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble about the island, 
shoot parrots and catch tortoises ; and when they came home at 
night the Spaniards provided their suppei*s for them. 

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this, had the others 
but let them -alone ; which, however, they could not find in their 
hearts to do long ; but, like the dog in the m mger, they would not 
eat themselves, neither would they let the oiheis eat. The differ- 
ences, nevertheless, were at first but trivial, and such as are not 
worth relating ; but at last it broke out into open war : and it began 
with all the rudeness and insolence that can be imagined — without 
reason, without provocation, contrary to nature, and, indeed, to com- 
mon-sense ; and though it is true the first relation of it came from 
the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the accusers, yet when I 
came to examine the fellows they could not deny a word of it. 

But before I come to the particulars of this part, I must supply a 
defect in my former relation ; and this was, 1 forgot to set down, 
among the rest, that just as we were weighing the anchor to set sail, 
there happened a little quarrel on board of our ship, which I was 
once afraid would have turned to a second mutiny ; nor was it ap- 
peased till the captain, rousing up his courage and taking us all to his 
assistance, parted them by force, and, making two of the most 
refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in irons : and as they had 
been active in the former disorders, and let fall some ugly, dangerous 
words,' the second time he threatened to carry them in irons to Eng- 
land and have them hanged there for mutiny and running awaj*^ with 
the ship. This, it seems, though the captain did not intend to do it, 
frightened some other men in the ship ; and some of them liad put it 



tM ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

into the heads of the rest that the captaia only gave them good words 
for the present, till they should come to some English port, and that 
then they should be all put into jail and tried for their lives. The 
mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us with it ; upon which 
it was desired that I, who still passed for a great man among them, 
should go down with the mate and satisfy the men, and tell them that 
they might be assured, if tliey behaved well the rest of the voyage, 
all they had done for the time past should be pardoned. So I went, 
and after passing my honor's word to them, they appeared easy^ and 
the more so when I caused the two men that were in irons to be re- 
leased and forgiven. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night ; the 
wind also falling calm next morning, we found that our two men, 
who had been laid in irons, had stolen each of them a musket and 
some other weapons (what powder or shot they had we knew not), 
and had taken the ship's pinnace, which was not yet hauled up, and 
run away with her to their companions in roguery on shore. As 
soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat on shore with twelve 
men and the mate, .and away they went to seek the rogues ; but they 
could neither find them nor any of the rest, for they all ded into the 
woods when they saw the boat coming on shore. The mate was 
once resolved, in justice to their roguery, to have destroyed their 
plantations, burned all their household stuff and furniture, and left 
them to shift without it ; but having no orders, he let it all alone, left 
everything as he found it, and bringing the pinnace away, came on 
board without them. These two men made their number five ; but 
the other three villains were so much more wicked than they, that 
after they had been two or three days together I hey turned the two 
new-comers out of doors to shift for themselves, and would have 
nothing to do with thein ; nor could they, for a good while, be per- 
suaded to give them any food ; as for the Spaniards, they were not 
yet come. 

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the business began to go 
forward : the Spaniards would have persuaded the three English 
brutes to have taken in their countrymen a.g}iiu, that, as they said, 
they might be all one family ; but they would not hear of it : so the 
two poor fellows lived by themselves ; and finding nothing but in- 
dustry and application would make them live comfortably, they 
pitched their tents on the nortli shore of the island, but a little more 
to the west, to be out of danger of the savages, who always landed 
on the east parts of the island. 

Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in and the other to 
lay up their magazines and stores in ; and the Spaniards, having 
given ihem some corn for seed, and some of the peas which I had 
left them, they dug, planted, and inclosed after the pattern I had set 
for them all, and began to live pretty well. Their first crop of com 
was on the ground ; and though it was but a little bit of land which 



_!j=i 




ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 235 

they bad .du^ up at first, having had but a little time, yet it was 
enough to rdieve them, and find them with bread and other eat- 
ables ; and one of the fellows, being the cook*8 mate of the ship, was 
very ready at making soup, puddings, and such other preparations as 
the rice and the milk, and such little flesh as they got, furnished him 
to do. 

They were going on in this little thriving i)osition when the three 
unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in mere humor, and to 
insult them, came and bullied them, and told them the island was 
theirs : that the governor, meaning me, had given them the posses- 
sion of it, and nobody else had any right to it ; and that they should 
build no houses upon their ground unless they would pay rent for 
them. 

The two men, thinking they were jesting at first, asked tliem to 
come in and sit down, and see what fine houses they were that they 
had built, and to tell them what rent they demanded ; and one of 
them merrily said, if they were the ground landlords, he hoped, if 
they built tenements tipon their land and made improvements, they 
would, accordin«? to the custom of landlords, grant a long lease ; and 
desired tliey would get a scrivener to draw the writings. One of the 
three, cursing and raging, told them they should see they were not in 
jest ; and going to a little place at a distance, where the honest men 
had made a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a firebrand and claps 
it to the outside of their hut, and very fairly set it on fire ; and it 
would have been all burned down in a few minutes if one of the 
•two had not run to the fellow, thrust him away, and trod the fire out 
with his feet, and that not without some difficulty too. 

The fellow was in such a rage at the bonest man^s thrusting him 
away that he returned upon him, with a pr>le he had in his hand ; 
and had not the man avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the 
hut, he had ended his days at once. His comrade, seeing the danger 
they were both in, ran in after him, and immediately they came both 
out with their muskets, and the man that was first struck at with the 
pole knockfd the fellow down that began the quarrel, with the stock 
of his musket, and that before the other two could come to help him ; 
and then seeing the rest come at them they stood together, and pre- 
senting the other ends of their pieces to them, bade them stand off. 

The others had firearms with them too ; but one of the two hon- 
est men, bolder than his comrade, and made desperate by his dan- 
ger, told them, ff they offered to move hand or foot they w(ax*-d<'»d 
men, and boldlv commanded them to lay down their arms.^ Thc^y 
did not, indeed, lay down their arms, but seeing him so resoUUe, it 
brought them to a parley, and they consented to take their woundod 
man with them «nil be gone ; and, indeed, it seems the fellow was 
wounded sutficiently with the blow. However, they were m^ich in 
the wrong, since they had the advantage, that they did not disarm 
them effectually, as they might have done, and have gone immedlaioiy

236 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

to the Spaniards and given them an account how the rogues had 
-treated them ; for the three villains studied nolhing hut revenge, and 
every day gave them some intimation that they did so. 

But not to crowd this part with an account bf the lesser part of 
the rogueries, such as treading down their corn, shooting three 
young kids and a she goat, which the poor men had got to breed up 
tame for their store, and, in a word, plaguing them night and day 
in this manner ; it forced the two men to such a desperation that 
they resolved to fight them all three, the first tjme they had a fair op- 
portunity. In order to do this, they resolved to go to the castle, as 
they called it (that was my old dwelhng), where the three rogues and 
the Spaniards all lived together at that time, intending to have a fair 
battle, and the Spaniards should stand by to see fair play : so they 
got up in the morning before day and came to the place, and called 
the Englishmen by their names, telling a Spaniard that answered 
that they wanted to speak with them. 

It happened that, the day before, two of the Spaniards, having been 
in the woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom, for dis- 
tinction, I called the honest men, and he had made a sad complaint 
to the Spaniards of the barbarous usage they had met with from their 
three countrymen, and how they had ruined their plantation and de- 
stroyed their corn that they had labored so hard to bring forward, 
and killed the milch-goat and their three kids, which was all they 
had provided for their sustenance ; and that if he and his friends 
(meaning the Spaniards) did not assist them again they should be 
starved. When the Spaniards came home at night, and they were , 
all at supper, one of them took the freedom to reprove the three 
Englishmen, though in very gentle and mannerly terms, and asked 
them how they could be so cruel, they bein^ harmless, inoffensive 
fellows : that they were putting themselves m a way to subsist by 
their labor, and that it had cost them a gieat deal of pains to bring 
things to such perfection as they were then in. 

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, ** What had they to 
do there? that they came on shore without leave; and that thejr 
should not plant or build upon the island ; it was none of their 
ground." ** Why," says the Spaniard, very calmly, '* Seignior In- 
glese, they must not starve." The Englishman replied, like a roughs 
hewn tarpauling, ** They might starve; they should not plant nor 
build in that place." But what must they do then, seignior?*' 
vsaiil the Spaniard. Another of the brutes returned, *'Do? they 
should be servants, and work for them." "But how can you ex- 
pc'C'Mljat of them?" says the Spaniard ; " they are not bought with. 
your money ; you have no right to make them, servants." The Eng- 
lishman answered, " The island was theirs ; the governor had given 
i(. to them, and no man had anything to do there but themselves ;" 
and with that swore by his Maker that they would go and burn all 
their new huts ; they should build none upon their land* ** Why, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 23? 

seignior,*' says the Spaniard, '* by the same rule, we must be your 
servants too." ** Ay/' says the bold dog, ** and so you shall, too, 
before we have done with you;*' mixing two or three oaths in the 
proper Intervals of his speech. The Spaniard only smiled at that, and 
made him no answer. However, this little discourse had heated 
them ; and startin/i^ up, one says to the other (I think it was he they 
called Will Atkins), " Come, Jack, let's go, and have t'other brush 
with them ; we'll demolish their castle, 1 11 warrant you ; they shall 
plant no colony in our dominions." 

Upon this they went all trooping away, with every man a gun, a 
pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent things among them- 
selves, of what they would do to the Spaniards too, when oppor- 
tunity offered ; but the Spaniards, it seems, did not so perfectly un- 
derstand them as to know all the particulars, only that, in general, 
they threatened them hard for taking the two Englishmen's part. 

Whither they went or how they bestowed their time that evening, 
the Spaniards said they did not know ; but it seems they wandered 
about the country part of the night, and then lying down in the 
place which I used to call my bower, they were weary and overslept 
themselves. The case was this : they had resolved to stay till mid- 
night, and so to take the two poor men when they were asleep, and 
as they acknowledged afterward, intended to set fire to their huts 
while they were in them\ and either burn them there or murder them 
as they came out. As malice seldom sleeps very sound, it was very 
strange they should not have been kept awake. 

However, as the two men had also a design upon them, as I have 
said, though a much fairer one than that of burning and murdering, 
it happened, and very luckily for them all, that they were up and 
gone abroad before the bloody-minded rogues came to their huts. 

When they came there and found the men" gone. Atkins, who, it 
seems, was the forwardest man, called out to his comrade, " Ha, Jack, 
here's the nest, but the birds are flown.*' They mused awhile, to 
think what should be the occasion'of their being gone abroad so soon, 
and suggested presently that the Spaniards had given them notice of 
it; and with that they shook hands and swore to one another that 
they would be revenged of the Spaniards. As so6n as they had 
made this bloody bargain they fell to work with the poor men's hab- 
itation ; they did hot set fire, indeed, to anything, but they pulled 
down both their houses, and pulled them so limb from limb that they 
left not the least stick standing, or scarce any sign on the ground 
where they stood ; they tore all their little collected honsehold stuff 
in pieces, and tlwew everything about in such a manner that the 
poor men afterward found some of their things a mile off their habi- 
tation. When they had done this, they pulled up all the young trees 
which the poor nien had planted ; pulled up an inclosufe they had 
made to secure their cattle and their corn ; and, in a word, sacked 
and plundered everything as completely as a horde of Tartars would 
havo done. 



238 ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 

, The two men were, at this juncture, gone to find them out, wid 
had resolved to fierht them wherever they had been, though they were 
but two to three ; so that,' had they met, there certainly would have 
been bloodshed among them ; for they were ail very stout, resolute 
fellows, to give them their due. 

But Providence took more care to keep Ihem asunder than they 
themselves could do to meet ; for, as if tlj('y had dogged one anothei^ 
when the three were gone thither, the two were here : and afterward^ 
when the two went back, to find them, the three were come to the 
old habitation again : we shall see their different conduct presently. 
When the three came back, like furious creatures, fluslied with the 
rage which the work they hc.d been about had put them into, they 
came up to the Spaniards and told them what they had done, by way 
of scon and bravado ; and one of them slepping^ up to one of the 
Spaniards, as if they had been a couple of boys at play, takes hold 
of his hat as it was upon hi» head, and giving it a twirl about; fieer- 
ing in his face, says to him, *' And you. Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall 
have the same sauce, if you do not mend your manners," The 
Spaniard, who, though a quiet, civil man, was as brave a man as could 
be, and, withal, a strong, well-made man, looked at him for a good 
while, and then, having no weapon in his hand, stepped gravely up 
to him, and, with one blow of his fist, knocked him down, as an ox 
is felled with a pole-axe ; at which one of the rogues, as insolent as 
the first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard immediately ; he missed his 
body indeed, for the bullets went through his hair, but one of them 
touched the tip of his ear, and he bled pretty much. The blood made 
the Spaniard believe he was more hurt than he really was, and that 
put him into some heat, for before he acted all in a perfect calm ; 
but now, resolving, to go through with his work, he stooped, and took 
the fellow's musket whom he had knocked down, and was just going 
to shoot the man who had fired at him^ when the rest of the Span- 
iards, being in the cave, came out, and calling to. him not to shoot, 
they stepped in, secured the other two, and tQok their arms from 
them. 

When they were thus disarmed, and found they had made all the 
Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own countrymen, they be- 
gan to cool, and, giving the Spaniards better words, would haveiiad 
their arms again ; but the Spaniards, considering the feud that was 
between them and the other two Englishmen, and that it would be 
the best method they could take to keep them frQjn killing one an- 
other, told them they would do them no harm ; and if they would 
live peaceably, they would be very willing to assist and associate 
with them as they aid before ; but that they could not think of giv- 
ing them their arms again, while they appeared so resolved to do mis- 
chief with them to their own countrymen, and had even threatened 
thorn all to make them their servants. 

The rogues were now no more capable to hear reason than to act 



ROBINSOiq^ CKUSOE. 239 

with reason ; but being refused their arms, they, went raving away, 
and raging Itiie madmen, threatening what they would do, though 
they had no firearms. But the Spaniards, despising tlieir threaten- 
ing, told them they should take care how they offered any injury to 
their plantation or cattle ; for if they did, they would shoot them as 
they would ravenous beasts, wherever they found them ; and if they 
fell into their hands alive, they should certainly be hanged. How- 
ever, this was far from cooling them, but away they went, raging 
and swearing like furies of hell. As soon as they were gone, the two 
men came back, in passion and rage enough also, though of another 
kind ; for having been at their plantation, and finding it all demol- 
ished and destroyed, as above, it will easily be supposed they had 
provocation enough. They could scarce have room to tell their tale, 
the Spaniards were so eager to tell them theirs ; and it was strange 
enough to find that three men should thus bully nineteen, and re- 
ceive no punishment at all. 

The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and especially, having thus 
disarmed them, made light of their thi^eatcnings ; but the two Eng- 
lishmen resolved to have their remedy against them, what pains 
soever it cost to find them out. But the Spaniards interposed here 
too, and told them that as they had disarmed them they could not 
consent that they (the two) should pursue them with firearms, and 
perhaps kill theni. !* But," said the grave Spaniard, who was their 
governor, *' we will endeavor tamake them do you justice, if you 
will leave it to us ; for there is no doubt but they will come to us 
again, when theirpassion is over, being not able to subsist without 
our assistance. We promise you to make no peace with them with- 
out having a full satisfaction for you ; and, upon this condition, we 
hope you will promise to use no violence with them, other than in 
your own defence." The two Englishmen yielded to this very awk- 
wardly, aud with great reluctance ; but the Spaniards protested that 
they did it onlv to keep them from bloodshed, and to make them all 
easy at last. For," said they, ** we are not so many of us ; here is 
room enough for us all, and it is a great pity that we should not l)e 
all good friends^" At length they/lid consent, and waited for the 
issue of the thing, living for some days with tlie Spaniards ; for their 
own habitation was destroyed. 

In about five days' time, the three vagrants, tired with wandering, 
and almost starved with hunger, having chiefly lived on turtles' eggs 
all that while, cafhe back to the grove ; and finding my Spaniard, 
who, as I have said, was the governor, and two more with him, walking 
by the side of the creek, they came up in a very submissive, humble 
manner, and begged to be received again into the family. The Span- 
iards used them civilly, but told them they had acted so unnaturally to 
their countrymen, and so very grossly to them (the Spaniards), that 
they couid not (;ome to any CDnclusion without consulting the two 
£nglis|;men and the rest ; b(;t, however, they would go to ihem and 



^jr 



240 ROBIKSOl^ CRUSOE. 

discourse about it, apd they should know in half an hour. It may 
be guessed that they were very hard put to it ; for, it seems, as they 
were to wait this half hour for an answer, they begged they would 
send them out some bread in the mean time, which they did, send- 
ing, at the same time, a large piece of goat's flesh and a boiled par- 
rot, which they ate very heartily, for they were hungry enough. 

After half an hour's consultation they were called in, and a long 
debate ensued, their two countrymen charging them with the ruin 
of all their labor, and a design to murder them ; all which they 
owned before, and therefore could not deny now. Upon the whole, 
the Spaniard^ acted the moderators between them ; and as they had 
obliged the two Englishmen not to hurt the three while they were 
naked and unarmed, so they now obliged the three to go and rebuild 
their fellows' two huts, one to be of the same and the other of larger 
dimensions than they were before ; to fence their ground again 
where they had pulled up their fences, plant trees in the room of 
those puUed up, dig up the land again for planting corn where they 
had spoiled it, and, in a word, to restore everything to the same state 
as they found it, as near as they could ; for ientirely it could not be, 
the season for the corn and the growth of the trees and hedges not 
being possible to be recovered. 

Well, they submitted to all this ; and as they had plenty of pro- 
visions given them all the while, they grew very orderly, and the 
wliole society began to live pleasantly and agreeably together again ; 
only that these three fellows could never l^ persuaded to work — ^I 
mean for themselves — except now and then a little, just as they 
pleased ; however, the Spaniards told them plainly, that if they would 
but live sociably and friendly together, and study the good of the 
whole plantation, they would be content to work for them, and let 
them walk about ana be as idle as they pleased ; and thus, having 
lived pretty well together for a month or two, the Spaniards gave 
them arms again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with them as 
before. 

It was not above a week after they had these arms, and went 
abroad, before the ungrateful creatures began to be as insolent and 
troublesome as ever ; but, however, an accident ha'^pened presently 
upon this, which endangered the safety of them all ; and they were 
obliged to lay by all private resentments and look to the preservation, 
of their lives.- 

. It happened one night that the Spanish governor, a« I call him — 
that is to say, the Spaniard whose life I had saved — who was no^v 
the captain, or leader, or governor of the rest, found himself very- 
uneasy in the night, and could by no means get any sleep : he was 
perfectly well in body, as he told me the story, only found his. 
thoughts tumultuous ; his mind ran upon men nghting and killing 
one another ; but he was broad awake, and could not by any means 
get any sleep ; in short, he lay a great while, but, growing more and 




ROBIKSOK CRUSOE. 241 

more uneasy, he resolved to rise. As they lay, being so many of 
them, on goat-skins laid thick upon such coucbes and pads as they 
made for themselves, and not in hammocks and ship- beds as I dia, 
who was but one, so they had little to do, when they were willing to 
rise, but to get upou their feet, and perhaps put on a coat, such as it 
was, and their pumps, and they were ready for going any way that 
their thoughts guided them. Being thus got up, he looked out ; but, 
being dark, he could see little or nothing : and, besides, the trees 
which I had planted, as in my former account is described, and 
which were now grown tall, intercepted his sight, so that he could 
only look up, and see that it was a clear starlight night, and, hearing 
na noise, he returned and laid him down a^am ; but it was all one : 
he could not sleep, nor could he compose himself to anything iike 
rest ; but his thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, and he knew 
not for what. 

Having made some noise with rising and walkTng about, going out 
and coming in, another of them waked, and, calling, asked who it 
was tliat was up. The governor told him how it had been with him. 
** Say you so ? says the other Spaniard ; ** such things are not to be 
sliglitf^, I assure you ; there is certainb| some mischief working 
near us ;*' and presently he asked him. Where are the English- 
men?'* " They are all in their huts," says he, '* safe enough. It 
seems the Spaniards had kept possession of the main apartment, and 
had made a place for the three Englishmen, who, since their last 
mutiny, were always quartered by themselves, and could not come 
at the rest. " Well," says the Spaniard, ** there is something in it, I 
am persuaded, from my own experience. I am satisfied our spirits 
embodied have a converse with, and receive intelligence from, the 
spirits uneuibodied, and inhabiting the invisible world ; and this 
friendly notice is given for our advantage, if we knew how to make 
use of it. Come, says he, ** let us go and look abroad ; and if we 
find nothing at all in it to justify the trouble, I'll tell you a story to 
the purpose, that shall convince you of the justice of my proposing 
it." 

In a word, they went out, to go up to the top of the hill, where I 
used to go ; but they, being strong, and a goo<i company, not alone, 
as I was, used none of my cautions, to go up by the ladder, and pull- 
ing it up after them, to go up a second stage to the top, but were 
going round through the grove, unconcerned and unwary, when they 
were surprised with seeing a light as of fire, a very little way off from 
them, and hearing the voices of men — not of one or two, but of a 
great nujnber. 

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages landing on the 
island, it was my constant care to prevent them making the least dis- 
covery of there being any inhabitant upon the place ; and when by 
any occasion they came to know it, they felt it so effectually that 
they that got away were scarce able to givQ any account of it ; for w# 



242 ROBINSQK CRUSOE. 

disappeared as soon as possible ; nor did ever any that had seen me 
escape to tell any one else, except it was the three savages in our last 
encounter, who jumped into the boat ; of whom, I mentioned, I was 
afraid they should go home and bring more help. Whether it was 
the consequence of the escape of those men that so great a number 
came now together, or whether they came i^s^nomntly, and by acci- 
dent, on their usual bloody errand, the Spaniards could not, it seems, 
understand ; but whatever 4t was, it had been their business either to 
have concealed themselves or not to have seen them at all. much 
less to have let the savages have seen that there were any inhabitants 
in the place ; or to have fallen upon them so effectually as that not 
a man of them should have escaped, which could only have been by 
gettiug in between them and their boats ; but this presence of mind 
was wanting to them, which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a 
great while. , 

We need not doubt but that the governor and the man with him, 
surprised with this sight, ran back immediately aUd raised their fel- 
lows, giving them an account of the imminent danger they were all 
in, and they again as readily took the alarm ; but it was impossibije 
to persuade them to staj^close within where they were, but they 
must all run out to see how things stood, v 

While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, and they had 
opportunity enough, for some hours, to view them by the light of 
three fires they had made at a distance from one another ; what they 
were doing they knew not, and what to do themselves they knew not. 

For, first, the enemy were too many ; and, secondly, they did not 
keep together, but were divided into several parties, and were on 
shore in several places. 

The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight ; and, 
as they found that the fellows ran straggling all over the shore, they 
made no doubt but, first or last, some of them would chop in upon 
their habitation, or upon some other place, where they would see the 
token of inhabitants ; and they were in great perplexity also for fear 
of their flock of goats, which would have been little less than starv- 
ing them, if they should have been destroyed ; so the first thing they 
resolved upon was to dispatch three men away before it was light, 
two Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive all the goats away to 
the great valley where the cave was, and if need were, to drive Ihem 
into the very cave itself. Could they have seen the savages all to- 
gether in one body, and at a distance from their canoes, they re- 
solved, if there had. been a hundred of them, to have attacked them ; 
but that could not be obtained, for they were some of them two 
miles off from the other ; and as it appeared afterward, were of two 
different nations. 

After having mused a great while on the course they should take, 
and beating their brains in considering their present circumstances, 
they resolved at last, while it was still dark, to send the old savage.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 243 

Friday's father, out as a spy lo learn, if possible, something concern- 
ing them — as what they came for, what they intended to do, and the 
like. The old man readily undertook it ; and stripping himself quite 
naked, as most of the savages were, away he went. After he had 
been gone an hour or two, he brings word that he had been among 
them undiscovered — that he found they were two parties, and of 
two several nations who had war with one another, and had a great 
battle in their own country ; and that both sides having had several 
prisoners taken in the fight, they were by mere chance landed all on 
the same island for the devouring their prisoners and making merry ; 
but (heir coming so by chance to the same place had spoiled all their 
mirth — that they were in a great rage at one another, and were so 
near that he believed they would fighc again as soon as daylight be- 
gan to appear ; but he did not perceive that they bad any notion of 
anybody being on the island but themselves. He had hardly made 
an end of telling his story, when they could perceive, by the unusual 
noise they made, that the two little armies were engaged in a bloody 
fight. 

Friday's father used all the arguments he could to persuade our 
people to lie close and not be seen ; he told.them their safety consist- 
ed in it, and that they had nothing to do but lie still, and the savages 
would kill one another to their hands, and then the rest would go 
away ; and it was so to « tittle. But it was impossible to prevail, 
especially upon the Englishmen ; their curiosity was so imporiunalc 
upon their prudentials that they must run out and see the battle ; 
however, they used some caution, too ; they did not go openly, just 
by their own dwelling, but went farther into the woods, and placed 
themselves to advantage, where they might securely see them manage 
the fight, and, as they thought, not be seen bv them ; but it seems the 
savages did see them, as we shall find hereafter. 

The battle w^ very fierce ; and if I might believe the Englishmen, 
one of them said he could perceive that some of them were men of 
great bravery, of invincible spirits, and of great policy in guiding 
the fight. The battle they said held two hours before they could 
guess which partv would be beaten ; but then that party which was 
nearest our people's habitation began to appear weakest, and after 
some time more some of them began to fiy ; and this put our men 
again into a great consternation lest any one of those that fled should 
run into the grove before their dwelling for shelter, and thereby in- 
voluntarily discover the place ; and that by consequence the pur- 
suers would do the like in search of them. Upon this, they resolved 
that .they would stand armed within ibe wall, and whoever came 
into the grove, they resolved to sally out over the wall and kill them, 
so that, if possible, not one should return to give an account of it ; 
they ordered also that it should be done with their swords, or by 
knocking them down with the stocks of their muskets, but not by 
shooting them, for fear of raising an alarm by the noise. 



L 



244 ROBINSON- CRUSOE. 

As they expected, it fell out ; three of the routed army fled for life, 
and crossing the creek, ran directly into the place, not in the least 
knowing whither they went, but running as into a thick wood for 
shelter. The scout they kept to look abroad gave notice of this 
within, with this addition, to our men*s great satisfaction, viz., that 
the conquerors had not pursued them, or seen which way they were 
gone ; upon this the Spaniard governor, a man of humanity,'would 
not suffer them to kill the three fugitives, but sending three men out 
by Uie top of the hill, ofdered them togo round, come in behind them, 
and surprise and take them prisoners ; which was done. The residue 
of the conquered people fled to their canoes and got off to sea ; the vic- 
tors retired, made no pursuit, or very little, but drawing themselves 
into a body together, gave two great screaming shouts, which they 
supposed was by way of triumph — and so the tight ended ; and the 
same day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they also marched to 
their canoes. And thus the Spaniards had the island again f i*ee to 
themselves, their fright was over, and they saw no savages for sev- 
eral years after. 

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of their den, and 
viewing the field of battle, they found about two-and-thirty men dead 
on the spot : some were killed with great long arrows, some of which 
were found sticking in their bodies ; but most of them were killed 
with great wooden swords, sixteen or seventeen of which they found 
in the field of battle, and as many bows, with a great many arrows. 
These swords were strange, greAt unwieldy things, and they must be 
very strong men that used them ; most of those men that were killed 
with them had their heads mashed to pieces, as we may say, or, as 
we call it in English, their brains knocked out, and several their arms 
and legs broken ; so that it is evident they fight with inexpressible 
rage and fury. We found not one man that was not stone dead — 
for either they stay by their enemy, till they have killed him, or they 
carry all the wounded men that &j» not quite dead away with them. 

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great while ; the 
sight had filled them with horror, and the consequences appeared 
terrible to the last degree, especially upon supposing that some time 
or other they should fall into the hands of those creatures, who would 
not only kill them as enemies but kill them for food, as we kill our 
cattle ; and they professed to me that the thoughts of being eaten up 
like beef and mutton, though it was supposed it was not to be till 
they were dead, had something in it so horrible that it nauseated 
their very stomachs, made them sick when they thought of it, and 
filled their minds with such unusual terror that they were not them- 
selves for some weeks after. This, as I said, tamed even the three 
English brutes I have been speaking of ; and for a great while after 
they were tractable, and went about the common business of the 
whole society well enough — planted, sowed, reaped, and began to bo 
all naturalized to the country. But some time after this they fell 



" r'lMrB 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 245 

into such simple measures again as brought them into a great deal 
of trouble. 

They had taken three prisoners, as I observed ; and these throe be- 
ing lusty, stout young fellows, they made them servants and taught 
them to work for them ; and as slaves they did well enough ; but 
they did not take their measures with them as I did by my man Fri- 
day, viz., to begin with them upon the principle of having saved 
their lives, and then instruct them in the rational principles of Kfe — 
* much less of religion — civilizing and reducing them by kind usage 
and affectionate arguments ; but as they gave them their food every 
day, so they gave them their work too, and kept them fully em- 
ployed in drudgeiy enough ; but they failed in this by it, that they 
never had them to assist them and fight for them as I had my man 
Friday, who was as true to me as the very flesh upon my bones. 

But to come to the family part. Being all now good friends, for 
common danger, as I said above, had effectually reconciled them, 
they began to consider their general circumstances ; and the first 
thing that came imder consideration was whether, seeing the savages 
particularly haunted that side of the island, and that there were more 
remote and retired parts of it equally adapted to their way of living, 
and manifestly to their advantage, they should not rather move their 
habitation and plant in some more proper place for their safety, and 
especially.for the security of their cattle and corn. 

Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that they would not 
remove their habitation ; because that, some time or other, they 
thiiught they might hear from their governor again, meaning me ; 
and if I should send any one to seek them, I should be sure to direct 
them to that side, where, if they should find the place demolished, 
they wouU conclude the savages had killed us all and we were gone, 
and sa our supply would go too. But as to their com and cattle, they 
agreed to remove them into the valley where my cave was, where 
the land was as proper for. both, and where, indeed, there was land 
enough ; however, upon second thoughts, they altered one part of 
their resolution too, and resolved only to remove part of their cattle 
thither and plant part of their corn there ; and so, if one part was 
destroyed, the other might be saved. And one part of prudence, they 
used, which it was very well they did — that they never trusted those 
three savages which they had prisoners with knowing anything of the 
plantation they had made in that valley, or of any cattle they had 
there, much less of the cave there, which they kept in case of neces- 
sity as a safe retreat ; and thither they carried also the two barrels of 
powder, which I had sent them at my coming away. But, how- 
ever, they resolved not to change their habitation ; yet they agreed, 
that as I had carefully covered it first with a wall or fortification, and 
then with a grove of trees, so seeing their safely consisted entirely in 
their being concealed, of which they were now fully convinced, they 
set to work to cover and conceal the place yet more effectually than 



246 KOBINSON CRUSOE. 

before. For this purpose, as I planted trees, or rather thrust in 
stakes, which in time all grew up to be trees, for some good distance 
before the entrance into my apartments, they went on in the same 
manner and filled up the rest of that whole space of ground, from the 
trees 1 had set quite down to the side of the creek, where, as I said^ I 
landed my floats, and even into the very ooze where the tide flow^, 
not so much as leaving any place to land or any sign that there had 
been any landing thereabout—these stakes also being of a wood very 
forward to grow, as I have noted formerly, they took care to liave 
them generally much larger and taller than those which I had 
planted ; and as they grew apace, so they planted them so very 
thick and close together that when they had been three or four years 
grown there was no piercing with the eye any considerable way into 
the plantation ; and as forlhat part which 1 had planted, the trees 
were grown as thick as a man's thigh, and among them they placed so 
many other short ones and so thick, that, in a word, it stood like a 
palisado a quarter of a mile thick, and it was next to impossible to 
penetrate it, but with a little army to cut it all down — ^for a little dog 
could hardly get between the trees, they etood so close. 

But this was not all ; for they did the same by all the ground to 
the right hand and to the left, and round even to the side of the bill, 
leaving no way, not so much as for themselves, to come out but by 
the ladder placed up to the side of the hill, and then lifted up and 
placed again from the first stage up to the top ; and when the ladder 
was taken down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to assist 
it could come at them. This whs excellently well contrived ; nor 
wad it less than what they afterward found occasion for, which 
served to convince me, that as human prudence has the authority of 
Providence to justify it, so it has doubtless the direction of Provi- 
dence to set it to work ; and if we listened carefully to the voice of 
it, I am persuaded we might prevent many of the disasters which our 
hves are now, by our own negligence, subjected to. 

I return to the story. They lived two years after this in perfect 
retirement, and had no more visits from the savages. They had, in- 
deed, an alarm given them one morning, which put them into a great 
consternation ; for, some of the Spaniards being out early one morn- 
ing on the west side, or rather end, of the island (which was that end 
where I never went for fear of being discovered), they were surprised 
with seeing above twenty canoes of Indians just coming on shore. 
They made the best of their way home in hurry enough ; and giving 
the alarm to their comrades, they kept close all that day and the 
next, going out only at night to make their observation ; but they 
had the good luck to be mistaken, for wherever the savages went, 
they did not land that time on the island, but pursued some other 
design. 

And now they had another broil with the three Englishmen ; one 
of whom, a most turbulent fellow, being in a rage at one of the three 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. Ml 

slaves, whom I mentioned they had taken, because the fellow had 
not done something right which he bade him do, and seemed a little 
untractable in his showing him, drew a hatchet out of a frog-belt, in 
which he wore it by his side, and fell upon the poor savage, not to 
correct him but to kill him. One of the Spaniards, who was by, 
seeing him give the fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which 
he aimed at his head, but struck into his shoulder, so that he thought 
he had cut the poor creature's arm off, ran to him, and entreating 
him not to murder the poor man, placed himself between him and 
the savage to prevent the mischief. The fellow, being enraged tlie 
more at this, struck at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he 
would serve him as he intended to serve the savage ; which the 
Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and with a shovel which he 
had in his hand (for they were all working in the field about th^ir 
corn land) knocked the brute down. Another of the Englishmen 
running at the same time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard 
down ; and then two Spaniards more came in to help their man, and 
a third Englishman fell in upon them. They had none of them any 
firearms, or any other weapons but hatchets and other tools, except 
this third Englishman ; he had one of my rusty cutlasses, with which 
he made at the two last Spaniards and wounded them both. This 
fray set the whole family in an uprbar, and more help coming in, they 
took the three Englishmen prisoners. The next question was, what 
should be done with them ? They had been so often mutinous and 
were so very furious, so desperate and so idle withal, they knew not 
what course to take with them, for they wefe mischievous to the 
highest degree, and cared not what hurt they did to any man ; so 
that, in short, it was not safe to live with them. 

The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many .words, that 
if they liad been of his own country, he would have hanged them ; 
for all laws and all governors were to preserve society, and those who 
were dangerous to the society ought to be expelled out of it ; but as 
they were Englishmen, and that it was to the generous kindness of an 
Englishman that they all owed their preseiTation and deliverance, 
he would use them with all possible lenity, and would leave them to 
the judgment of the other two Englishmen, who were their country- 
men. 

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said they desired 
it might not be left to them. '* For," says he, ** I am sure we ought 
to sentence them to the gallows ;" and with that he gives an account 
how Will Atkins, one ot the three, had proposed to have all the five 
Englishmen join, together and murder all the Spaniards when they 
were in their sleep. 

When the Spaniard governor heard this, he calls to Will Atkins, 
"How, Seignior Atkins, would you murder us all? What have 
you to say to that ?" The hardened villain was so far from denying 
It, tliat he said it was true, and swore they would do it still before 



-ri~ 



248 HOBINSON CRUSOE. 

they had done with them. " Well, but Seignior Atkins," says the 
Spaniard, " wliat have we done to you that you will kill us ? And 
what would you get by killing us ? And what must we do to prevent 
your killing us ?" Must we kill vou, or you kill us ? Why will jon 
put us to the necessity of this, Seignior Atkins ?*' says the Spaniard 
very calmly, and smiling. Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at 
the Spaniard's making a jest of it, t^at, had he not been.held by thcee 
men and witbal had no weapon near him, it was thought he would 
have attempted to kill the Spaniard in the middle of all the company. 
This hare-brained carriage obliged them to consider seriously what 
was to be done ; the two Englishmen, and the Spaniard who saved the 
poor savage, were of the opinion that tbey should hang one of the 
three, for an example to the rest, and that particularly it should be he 
that had twice attempted to commit murder with his hatchet ; and, 
indeed, there was some reason to believe he had done it, for tlie poor 
savage was in such a miserable condition with the wound he had re- 
ceived, that it was thought he could not live. But the governor 
Spaniard still said no ; it was an Englishman that had saved all their 
lives, and he would never consent to put an Englishman to death, 
thoufich he had murdered half of them — nay, he said, if he had been 
killed himself by an Eofi^lishman, aud had time left to speak, it 
should be that they shoulcl pardon him. 

This was so positively insisted on by the governor Spaniard that 
there was no gainsaying it ; and as merciful counsels are most apt to 
prevail, where they are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into 
It ; but then it was to be considered what should be done to kct p 
them from doing the mischief they designed ; for all agreed, govern- 
or and all, that means were to be used for preserving the society 
from danger. After a long debate, it was agreed, first, that they 
should be disarmed and not permitted to have either gun, powder, 
shot, sword, or any weapon ; and should be turned out of the society 
and left to live where they would, and how they would, by them- 
selves ; but that none of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should 
converse with them, speak with them, or have anything to do with 
them ; that they should be forbid to come within a certain distance 
of the place where the rest dwelt ; and if they offered to commit any 
disorder, so as to spoil, bum, kill, or destroy any of the com, plant- 
ings, buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the society, they should 
die without mercy, and they would shoot them wherever they could 
find them. 

The governor, a man of great humanity, musing upon the sentence, 
considered a little upon it^ and turning to the two honest Engishmen, 
said, '* Hold ; you must reflect that it wiU be long ere they can raise 
corn and cattle of their own, and they must not starve ; we must 
therefore allow them provisions.'* So he caused to be added, that 
they should have a proportion of corn given them to last them eight 
monthSi and for seed to sow, by which time they might be supposed 



EOBINSON CRUSOE. 249 

to raise some of Iheir own ; that they should have six milch-goats, 
four lie-goats, and six kids given them, as well for present subsistence 
as for a store ; and that they should have tools given them for their 
Tvork in the delds, such as six hatchets, an adze, a saw, and the like ; 
but they should have none of these tools or provisions, unless they 
would swear solemnly that they would not hurt or injure any of the 
Spaniards with them, or of their fellow-Englishmen. 

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out to 
shift for themselves. They went away sullen and refractory, as neither 
content to go away nor to stay ; but, as there was no remedy, they 
went, pretending to go and choose a place where they woulcl settle 
themselves ; and some provisions were given them, but no weapons. 

About four or five days after, they came again for some victuals, 
and gave the governor an account where they had pitched their tents 
and marked themselves out a habitation ana plantation ; and it was 
a very convenient place indeed, on the remotest part of the island, 
N.E., much about the place where I providentially landed in my first 
voyage, when I was driven out to sea, the Lord knows whither, in 
my foolish attempt to sail round the island. 

Here they bunt tnemseives two Handsome huts, and contrived them 
in ^manner like my first habitation, being close under the side of a 
hill, having some trees growing already on three sides of it, so that by 
planting others it would be very easily covered from the sight, unless 
narrowly searched for. They desired some dried goat-skins, for beds 
and covering, which were given them ; and upon giving their words 
that they would not disturb the rest or injure any of their planta- 
tions, they gave them hatchets, and what other tools they could 
spare ; some peas, barley, and rice, for sowing ; and, in a word, any- 
thing they wanted except arms and ammunition. 

They lived in this separate condition about six months, and had 
got in their first harvest, though the quantity was but small, the 
parcel of land they had planted being but little ; for, indeed, 
having all their plantation to form, they had a great deal of work 
upon their hands ; and when they came to make boards and pots, 
and such things, they were quite out of their element, and could 
make nothing of it ; and when the rainy season came on. for want of 
a cave in t lie earth, they could not keep their grain dry, and it was 
in great danger of spoiling ; and this humbled them much : so they 
came and begged the Spaniards to help them, which they very 
readily did ; and in four days worked a great hole in the side of the 
hill for them, big enough to secure their corn and other things from 
the rain : but it was a poor place at best, compared to mine, and espe- 
cially as mine was then, for the Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, 
and made several new apartments in it. 

About three quarters of a year after this separation, a new frolic 
took these rogues, which, together with the former villainy they had 
committed, brought mischief enough upon them, and had very near 



250 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

been the ruin of the whole colony. The three new associates began, 
it seems, to be weary of the laborious life they led, and that without 
hope of bettering their circumstances : and a whim took them ihat 
they would make a voyage to the continent, from whence the sav- 
ages came, and would try if they could seize upon some prisoneis 
among the natives there, and bring them home, so as to make them 
do the laborious part of the work for them. 

The proiect was not so preposterous, if they had gone no further. 
But they did nothing, and proposed nothing ; but had either mis- 
chief in the design, or mischief in the event. And if I may give my 
opinion, they seemed to be under a blast from Heaven ; for if we 
will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible crimes, how shall we 
reconcile the events of things with the Divine justice ? It was cer- 
tainly an apparent vengeance on their crime of mutiny and piracy 
that Drought them to the state they were in ; and they showed not 
the least remorse for the crime, but added new villainies to it, such 
as the piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor slave because 
he did not, or perhaps could not, understand to do what he was 
directed, and to wound him in such a manner as made him a ciipple 
all his life, and in a place where no surgeon or medicine could be had 
for his cure ; and, what was still worse, the murdeious intent, or^ to 
do justice to the crime, the intentional murder — for such, to be sure, 
it was — as was afterward the formed design they all laid, to murder 
the Spaniards in cold blood, and in their sleep. 

- But I leave observing, and return to the story. The three fellows 
came down to the Spaniards one morning, and in very humble terms 
desired to be admitted to speak with them. The Spaniards very 
readily heard what they had to say, which was this : that they were 
tired of living in the manner they did, and that they were not 
handy enough to make the necessaries they wanted, and that having 
no help, they found they should be starved ; but if the Spaniards 
would give them leave to take one of the canoes which they came 
over in, and give them arms and ammunition prjoportioned to their 
defence, they would go over to the main and seek their fortunes, and 
so deliver them from the trouble of supplying them with any other 
provisions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but very hon- 
estly represented to them the certain destruction they were running 
into; told them. they had suffered such hardships upon that very 
spot, that they could, without any spirit of prophecy, tell them they 
would be starved or murdered, and bade them consider of it. 

The mim replied audaciously, they should be starved if they stayed 
here, for they could not work and would not work, and they could 
but be starved abroad ; and if they were murdered, there was an end 
of them ; they had no wives or children to cry after them ; and, in 
short, insisted importunately upon their demand, declaring they 
would go whether they gave theui any arms or no. 



ROBINfeOK CRUSOE. 251 

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if they were re- 
solved to go, they should not go Tike naked men, and be in no condi- 
tion to defend themselves ; and that though 4hey could ill spare their 
fireanns, having not enough for themselves, yet they would let them 
have two muskets^ a pistol, and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet, 
whtch they thought was sufficient for them. In a word, they ac- 
cepted the offer ; and having baked bread enough to serve them a 
month, and given them as much goats' flesh as they could eat while 
it was Bweet, and a great basket of dried gmpes, a pot of fresh water, 
and a young kid alive, they boldly set out in I he canoe for a voyage 
over the sea, where it was at least forty miles broad. 

The boat, indeed, was a large one, and would very well have car- 
ried fifteen or twenty men, and therefore was rather too big for them 
to manage ; but as they had a fair breeze, and flood-tide with them, 
they (lid well enough. They had made a mast of a long pole, and a 
sail of four large goat-skins dried, which they had sewed or laced to- 
gether ; and away they went merrily enough. The Spaniards called 
after them, ** Bon veyajo ;'' and no man ever thought of seeing them 
an^ more. 

The Spaniards were often saying to one another, and to the two 
honest Englishmen who remained behind, how quietly and comfort- 
ably they lived, now thefee thiee turbulent fellows were gone. As for 
their coming again, that was the remotest tiling from their thoughts 
that could be imagined ; when, behold, after i wo-andtwenty days' 
absence, one of the Englishmen, being abroad upon his planting- 
"work, sees three strange men coming toward him at a distance, with 
guns upon their shoulders. 

Away runs the Englishman, as if he was bewitched, comes fright- 
ened and amazed to the governor Spaniard, and tells him they were 
all undone, for there were strangers upon the island, but could not 
tell who they were. The Spaniard, pausing awhile, says to him, 
** How do you mean — you cannot tell who? Thev are the savages, 
to be sure." ** N<f, no," says the Englishman ; they are men in 
clothes, with arms." *'Nay, then," says the Spaniard, "why are 
you so concerned ? If they are not savages, they must be friends ; 
for there is no Christian nation upon earth but will do us good rather 
than harm." 

While they were debating thus, came the three Englishmen, and, 
standing without the wood, which was new planted, hallooed to 
them. They presently knew their voices, and so all the wonder 
ceased. But now the admiration was turned upon another question 
—what could be the matter, and what made them come back again ? 

It was not long before they brought the men in, and inquiring 
wheie they had been, and what they had been doing, they gave them 
a full account- of their voyage in a few words — that they had reached 
the land in two days, or something less ; but finding the people 
alarmed at their coming, and preparing with bows and arrows to 



252 KOBINSOK CftUSOE. 

fight them, they durst not go on shore, but sailed on to the north- 
ward six or seven hours, till they came to a great opening, by which 
they perceived that the land they saw from our island was not the 
mam, but an island. Upon entering that opening of the sea, they 
saw another island on the right hand, north, and several more west ; 
and being resolved to land somewhere, they put over to one of -the 
Islands which lay west, and went boldly on shore ; that they found 
the people very courteous and friendly to them ; and that thpy gave 
them several roots and some dried fish, and appeared very sociable ; 
and the women, as well as the men, were very forward to supply 
them with anything they could get for them to eat, and brought it to 
them a great way upon their heads. 

They continued here four days, and inquired, as well as they could 
of them, by signs, what nations were this way and that way, and were 
told of several fierce and terrible people that lived almost every way, 
who, as they made known by signs to them, used to eat men ; but, as 
for themselves, they said, they never ate men or women, except only 
such as they took in the wars ; and then, they owned, they made a 
great feast, and ate their prisoners. 

The Englishmen inquired when they had had a feast of that kind ; 
and they told them about two moons ago, pointing to the moon and 
to two Angel's ; and that their great king hrfd two hundred prisoners 
now, which he had taken in his war, and they were feeding th( ni to 
make them fat for the next feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty 
desirous of seeing those prisoners ; but the others, mistaking them, 
thought they were desirous to have some of them to carry away for 
their own eating. So they beckoned to them, pointing to the setting of 
the sun, and then to the rising ; which was to signify that the next 
morning at sunrising they would bring some for them ; and, accord- 
ingly, the next morning they brought down five women and eleven 
men, and gave them to the Englishmen, to cany with them on their 
voyage, just as we would bring so many cows and oxen down to a 
seaport town to victual a ship. * 

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home, their 
stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know what to do. 
To refuse the prisoners would have been the highest affront to the 
savage gentry that could be offered them, and what to do with them 
they knew not* However, after some debate, they resolved to ac- 
cept of them ; and, in return, they gave the savages that brought 
them one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of 
their bullets, which, though they did not understand their use, tliey 
seemed particularly pleased with ; and then tying the poor creat- 
ures' hands behind them, they dragged the prisoners into the boat 
for our men 

The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they had 
them, or else they that gave them this noble present would certainly 
have expected that they should have gone to work with them, have 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 253 

killed two or three of them the next morniotf, and, perhaps, have in- 
vited tlie donors to dinner. Bat having takeD their leave, with all 
the respect and thanks that could well pass between people, where, 
on either side, they understood not one word they could say, they 
put off with their boat, and came back toward the first island ; 
where, when they arrived, they set eight of their prisoners at liberty, 
there being too many of them for their occasion. 

In their voyage they endeavored to have some communication 
with their prisoners ; but it was impossible to make them understand 
anything. Nothing they could say to tliem, or give them, or do for 
them, but what was looked upon as going to murder them. They 
first of all unbound them ; but the poor creatures screamed at that, 
especially the women, as if they had just felt the knife at their 
throats ; for they immediately concluded they were unbound on pur- 
pose to be killed. If they gave them anything to eat, it was the same 
thing ; they then concluded it was for jfear they should sink in flesh, 
and so not be fat enough to kill. If they looked at one of them more 
particularly, the party presently concluded it was to see whether he 
or she was fattest, and fittest to kill first ; nay, after they had 
brought them quite over, and began to use them kindly, and treat 
them well, still they expected every day to make a dinner or supper 
for their new masters. 

When the three wanderers had given this unaccountable history or 
journal of their voya<;e, the Spaniard asked them where their new 
family was ; and being told that they had brought them on shore, 
and put them into one of their huts, and were come up to beg some 
victuals for them, they (the Spaniards) and the other two English- 
men, that is to say, the whole colony, resolved to* go all down to the 
place and see them ; and did so, and Friday's father with them. 

When they came into the hut, there ihey sat, all bound ; for when 
they had brought them on shore they bound their hands, that they 
might not take the boat and make their escape ; there, I say, they sat, 
all of them stark naked. First, there were three men, lust}'-, comely 
fellows, well shaped, straight and fair limbs, about thirty to thirty- 
five years of age ; and five women, whereof two might be from 
thirty to forty ; two niore not above four or five and twenty ; and 
the fifth, a tall, comely maiden, about sixteen or seventeen. The 
women were well-favored, agreeable persons, both in shape and feat- 
ures, only tawny ; and two of them, had they been perfect white, 
would have passed for very handsome women, even in London itself, 
having pleasant, agreeable countenances, and of a very modest be- 
havior ; especially when they came afterward to be clothed and 
dressed, as they called it, though that dress was very indifferent, it 
must be confessed. 

The si.a:ht, you may be sure, was something uncouth to our Span- 
iards, who were, to give them a just character, men of the best be- 
havior, of the most calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good humor,

that ever I met with ; and, in particular, of the rhost modesty ; I 
say, the sight was very uncouth, to see three naked iien and five 
naked women, all togetlier bound, and in the most miserable circum- 
stance^ that human nature could be supposed to be, viz., to be ex- 
pecting every moment to be dragged out and have their brains 
knocked out, and then to be eaten up like a calf that is killed for i^ 
dainty. 

The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, Friday's 
father, to go in and see, first, if he knew any of them, and then if 
he understood any of their s()eech. As soon as the old man qame in 
he looked seriously at them, but knew none of them ; neither could 
any of them understand a word he said or a sign he could make, ex- 
cept one of the women. However, this was enough to answer the 
end, which was to satisfy them that the men into whose hands they 
were fallen were Christians ; that they abhorred eating men or women ; 
and that they might be sure they would not be killed. As soon as 
they were assured of this, they discovered such a joy, and by such 
awkward gestures, several ways, as is hard to describe ; for it seems 
they were ot several nations. 

The woman, who was their interpreter, was bid in the next place to 
ask them if they wrre willing to be servants, and to wotk for the 
men who had brought thdm away to save their lives ; at which they 
all fell a-dancing ; and presently one fell to taking up this, and an- 
otiier that, anything that lay next, to carry on their shoulders, to in- 
timate they were willing to work. 

The governor, who found that the having women among them 
would presently be attended with some inconvenience, and might oc- 
casion some strife and perhaps blood, asked the three men what they 
intended to do with these women, and how they intended to use 
them, whether as servants or as wives. One of the Englishmen an- 
swered, very boldly and readily, that they would use them as both ; to 
which the governor said, ** I am not going to restrain you from it — ^you 
are your own masters as to that ; but this I think is but iust for avoid- 
ing disorders and quarrels among you, and I desire it of you for that 
reason only , viz. . that you will all engage, that if any of you take any of 
these women as a wife, that he shall take but one ; and that, having 
taken one, none else shall touch her ; for though we cannot marry 
any one of you, yet it is but reasonable that, whilejvou stay here, the 
woman any of you takes shall be maintained by the man that takes 
her, and should be his wife — I mean,'* says he, ** while be continues 
here, and that none else shall have anything to do with her." AU 
this appeared so just that every one agreed to it without any diffi- 
culty. 

Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they designed tp take 
any of them. But every one of them answered "No." Some of 
them said they had wives in Spain, and the others did not like wom- 
en that were not Christians ; and all together declared that they 



Jj^im 



t 



ROBIKSOX CRUSOE. 255 

would not touch one of them, which was an instance of such virtue 
as I have not met with in all my travels. On the other hand, to be 
short, the five Englishmen took them every one a wife — that is to say, 
a temporary wife ; and so they set up a new form of living ; for the 
Spaniards and Friday's father lived in my old habitation, which they 
had enlarged exceedingly within. The three servants which were 
taken in the last battle of the savages lived with them ; and these 
carried on the main part of the colony, supplied all the rest with 
food, and assif^ted them in anything as they could, or as they found 
necessity required. 

But the wonder of the story was how five such refractory, ill- 
matched fellows should agree about these women, and that two of 
them should not choose the same woman, especially seeing two or 
three of them were, without comparison, more agreeable than the oth- 
ers : but they took a good way enough to prevent quarrelling among 
themselves, for they set the five women by themselves in one of their 
huts, and they went all into the other hut and drew lots among them 
who should choose first. 

Hethat drew to choose first went away by himself to the hut where 
^e poor naked creatures were, and fetched out her he chose ; and it was 
worth observing that he that chose first took her that was reckoned 
the homeliest and oldest of the five, which made mirth enough 
among the rest ; and even the Spaniards laughed at it ; but the ftl- 
low considered better than any of them, that it was application and 
business they were to expect a.ssistance in, as much as in anything 
else ; and she proved the best wife of all the parcel. 

When the poor women saw thcpnselves set in a row thus, and 
fetched out one by one, the terrors of their condition returned upon 
them again, and they firmly believed they were now going to be de- 
voured. Accordingly, when the English sailor came in and fetched 
out one of them, the rest set up a most lamentable cry, and hung 
about her and took their leave of her with such agonies and affection 
as would have grieved the hardest heart in the world ; nor was it 
possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them that they were not to be 
immediately murdered, till they fetched the old man, Friday's father, 
who immeaiately let them know that the ^ve men who were to fetch 
them out, one by one, bad chosen them for their wives. 

When they had done, and the fright the women were in was a little 
over» the men went to work, and the Spaniards came and helped 
them ; and in a few hours they had built them every one a new hut 
or tent for their lodging apart ; for those they had already were 
crowded with their tools, household stuff, and provisions. The 
three wiciced ones had pitched farthest off, and the two honest ones 
nearer, but both on the north shore of the island, so that they contin- 
ued separated as before ; and thus my island was peopled in three 
places, and, as I might say, three towns were begun to be built. 

And here it is very well worth observing, that as it often happens in 



I 



■k.. 



266 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

the world (what the wise ends of God's providence are in such a dis- 
position of things I cannot say), the two honest fellows had the two 
worst wives ; and the three reprobates, tliat were scarce worth hang- 
ing, that were fit for nothing, and neither eeemed born to do them- 
selves good nor any one else, had three clever, diligent, careful, and 
ingenious wives ; not that the first two were bad wives as to their 
temper or humor, for all the five were most willing, quiet, passive, 
and subjected creatui^s, rather like slaves than wives ; but my 
meaning is they were not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, or 
alike cleanly and neat. 

Another observation I must make, to the honor of a diligent appli- 
cation on one hand and to the disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle 
temper on the other, that when I came to tlie place and viewed the 
several improvements, plantings, and management of the several little 
colonies, the two men had so far outgone the three that there was no 
comparison. They had, indeed, both of them as much ground laid 
out for corn as they wanted, and the reason was because, according 
to my rule, nature dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more 
corn than they wanted ; but the difference of the cultivation, of the 
planting, of the fences, and, indeed, of everything else, was ea$y to 
be seen at first view. 

Tlie two men had innumerable young trees planted about their 
huts, so that when you came to the place nothing was to be seen but 
a wood ; and thoue:h they had twice had their plantation demol- 
ished once by their own countrymen and once by the enemy, as 
shall be shown in its place, yet they had restored all again, and every- 
thing was thriving and flourishing about them : they had grapes 
planted in order and managed like a vineyard, though they had 
themselves never seen anything of that kind ; and by their good order- 
ing the vines, their grapes were as good again as any of the others. 
They had also found themselves out a retreat, in the thickest part of 
the woodft, where, though there was not a natural cave as I had 
found, yet they made one with incessant labor of their hands, and 
where, when the mischief which followed happened, they secured 
their wives and children so as they could never be found ; thev hav- 
ing, by sticking innumerable stakes and poles of the Wood, which, as 
I said, grew so readily, made the grove unpassable, except in some 
places, where they climbed up to get over the outside part, and 
then went on by ways of their own leaving. 

As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, though they weie 
much civilized by their settlement compared to what they were be- 
fore, and were not so quarrelsome, having not the same opportunity, 
yet one of the certain companions of a profligate mina never left 
them, and that was their idleness. It is true they planted com and 
made fences ; but Solomon's words were never better verified than in 
them : " I went by the vineyard of the slothful, and it was all over- 
grown with thorns ;" for when the Spaniards came to view their crop^ 



I 



• 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 257 

they could not see it in some places for weeds ; the hedge had several 
gaps in it, where the wild goats had got in and eaten up the corn ; 
perhaps here and there a dead bush was crammed in to stop them 
out for the present ; but it was only shutting the stable-door after the 
steed was stolen : whereas, when they loolced on the colony of the 
other two, there was the very face of industry and success upon all 
they did ; there was not a weed to be seen in all their corn or a gap in 
any of their hedges ; a£d they, on the other hanci, verified Solomon's 
words in another place, *' that the diligent hand maketh rich ;" for 
everything grew and thrived, and they had plenty within and with- 
out ; they had more lame cattle than the others, more utensils and 
necessaries within doors, and yet more pleasure and diversion too. 

It is true the wives of the three were very handy and cleanly within 
doors ; and having learned the English ways of dressing and cooking 
from one of the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was a cook's 
mate on board the ship, they dressed their husbands* victuals very 
nicely and well ; whereas the others could not be brought to under- 
stand it ; but then the husband, who, as I say, had been cook's mate 
did it himself. But as for the husbands of the three wives, they 
loitered about, fetched turtles* eggs and caught fish and birds ; in a 
word, anything but labor ; and they fared accordingly. The diligent 
lived well and comfortably, and the slothful hard and beggarly : and 
so I believe, generally speaking, it is all over the world. 

But I now come to a scene dilferent from all that had happened 
before, either to them or to me ; and the origin of the story was this : 
Early one niorning there came on shore five or six canoes of Indians 
or savages, call them which you please, and there is no room to 
doubt they came upon the old errand of feeding upon their slaves ; 
but that part was now so familiar to the Spaniards and to our men 
too that they did not concern themselves about it as I did : but hav- 
ing been made sensible by their experience, that their only business 
was to lie concealed, and that if they were not seen by any of the 
savages they would go off again quietly when their business was 
done, having as yet not the least notion of there being any inhab- 
itants in the island. ; I say, having been made sensible of this, they had 
nothing to do but to give notice to all the three plantations to keep 
within doors and not show themselves, only placing a scout in a 
proper place, to give notice when the boats went to sea again. 

This was, without doubt, very right ; but a disaster spoiled all 
these measures, and made it known among the savages that there 
were inhabitants there ; which was, in the end, the desolation of 
almost the whole colony. After the canoes with the savages were 
gone off, the Spaniards peeped abroad again ; and some of them had 
the curiosity to go to the place where they bad been, to see what they 
had been doing. Here, to their great surprise, they found three sav- 
ages left behind, and lying fast asleep upon the ground. It was sup- 
posed they had either been so gorged with their inhuman feast that, 
R. c.'-^ 



258 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

» 

like beasts, they were fallen asleep and would not stir when the oth- 
ers went, or they had wandered into the woods and did not uome 
back in time to be taken in. 

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and perfectly at a 
loss what to do. The Spanish governor, as it happened, was with them, 
and his advice was asked, but he professed he knew not what to do. 
As for slaves, they had enough already ; and as to killing tiiem, 
there were none of them inclined to do that : the Spanish governor 
told me they could not think of shedding innocent blood ; for as to 
them, Uie poor creatures had done them no wrong, invaded none of 
their property, and they thought they had no just quarrel against 
them to take away their lives. And here I must, in justice to these 
Spaniards, observe, that let the accounts of Spanish cruelty in Mex- 
ico and Peru be what they will, I never met with seventeen men of 
any nation whatsoever in any foreign country, who were so univer- 
sally modest, temperate, virtuous, so very good-himiored, and so 
courteous, as these Spaniards : and as to cruelty, they had nothing of 
it in their very nature ; no inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous 
passions ; and yet all of them men of great courage and spirit. 
Their temper and calmness had appeared in tlieir bearing the insuffer- 
able usage of the three Englishmen ; and their justice and humanity 
appeared now in the case of the savages, as above. After some con- 
sultation, they resolved upon this : that they would lie still awhile 
longer, till, if possible, these three men might be gone. But then the 
governor Spaniard recollected that the three savages hail no boat ; 
and if they were left to rove about the island they would certainly 
discover that there were inhabitants in it ; and so they should be un- 
done that way. Upon this they went back again, and there lay the 
fellows fast asleep still, and so they resolved to awaken them and take 
them prisoners ; and they did so. The poor fellows were strangely 
frightened when they were seized upon and bound ; and afraid, like 
the women, that thev should be murdered and eaten : for it seems 
those people think all the wotld does as they do, eating men's tiesh ; 
but they were soon made easy as to that, and away they carried 
them. 

It was very happy for them that they did not carry them home to 
their castle — I mean to my palace under the hill ; but they carried them 
lirst to the bower, where was the chief of their country work, such 
as the keeping the goats, the planting the^ corn, et€. ; and afterward 
they carried them to the habitation of the two Englishmei;. 

Here they were set to work, though it was not much they had for 
them to do ; and whether it was by negligence in guarding tJ^em or 
that they thought the fellows could not mcud themselves, I know not, 
but one of them ran away, and, taking to the woods, they could 
never hear of him any more. 

They had good reason to believe he got home again soon after in 
some other boats or canoes of savas^es who came on shore three or 



R0B1KS02T CRUSOE. 259 

four weeks afterward, and who, carrying on their revels as usual, 
went off in two days* time. This thought terrified Ihem exceed- 
ingljr ; for they concluded, and that not without good cause indeed, 
that if this fellow came home safe among his comrades, he would 
certainly give them an account that there were people in the island, 
and also how few and weak they were ; for this savage, as ob- 
served before, had never been told (and it was very happy he had 
not) how many there were or where they lived ; nor had he ever seen 
or heard the nre of any of their guns, much less had the^' shown him 
any of their other retired places, such as the cave in the valley, or 
the new retreat which tiie two Englishmen had made, and the like. 

The first testimony they had that this fellow had given intelligence 
of them was, that about two months after this six canoes of savages, 
with about seven, eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing 
along the north side of the island, where they never used to come 
before, and landed, about an hour after sunrise, at a convenient place 
about a mile from the habitation of the two Englishmen, where this 
escaped man had been kept. As the SpaniarcTgovernor said, had 
they been all tliere, the damage would not have been so inuch, for not 
a man of them would have escaped ; but the case differed now very 
much, for twa men to fifty was too much odds. The two men had 
the happiness to discover them about a league off. so that it was 
above an hour before they landed ; and as they landed a mile from 
their huts, it was some time before they could come at them. Now 
having great reason to believe that they were betrayed, the first 
thing they did was to bind the two slaves which were left, and cause 
two of the three men whom they brought with the women (who, it 
seems, proved very faithful to them), to lead them, with their two 
wives and whatever they could carry away with them, to their retired 
places in the woods, which I have spoten of above, and there to 
bind the two fellows hand and foot till they heard further. 

In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on shore, and 
that they had bent their course directly that way, they opened the 
fences where the milch-cows were kept, and drove them all out ; 
leaving their goats to straggle in the woods whither they pleased, 
that the savages might think they were all bred wild ; but the rogue 
who came with them was too cunning for that, and gave them an ac^ 
count of it all, for they went directly to the place. 

When the two poor frightened men had secured their wives and 
goods, they sent the other slave they had of the three who came with 
the women, and who was at their place by accident, away to the 
Spaniards with all speed, to give them the alarm, and desire speedy 
help, and in the mean time they took their arms and what ammu- 
nition they had, and retreated toward the place in the woods where 
their wtves were sent ; keeping at a distance, yet so that they might 
see, if possible, which way the savages took. 

They had not gone far, but that from a rising ground they could 



260 EOBINSON CRUSOE. 

see the little army of their enemies come on directjy to their habita* 
lion, and, in a moment more, could see all their huts and household 
stuff flaming up together, to their great grief and mortification ; for 
they had a very great loss, to them irretrievable, at least for some 
time. They kept their station for a while, till they found the savages, 
like wild beasts, spread themselves all over the place, rummaging 
every way, and every place they could think of, in search of prey ; 
and in particular for the people, of whom now it plainly appeared 
thev had intelligence. 

The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves not secure 
where they stood, because it was likely some of the wild people 
might come that way, and they might come too many together, 
thought it proper to make another retreat about half a mile farther ; 
believing, as it afterward happened, that the farther tliey strolled 
the fewer would be together. 

Their next halt was at the entrance into a very thick-grown pait 
of the woods, and where an old trunk of a tree stood, which was 
hollow and vastly large ; and in this tree they both took their stand- 
ing, resolving to see there what might offer. They had not stood 
there long before two of the savages appeared, runuiDg directly that 
way, as ii Ihey already had notice where they sicod, and weie com- 
)Dg up to attack them ; and a little way farther they espied three 
more coming after them, and five more beyond them, all coming the 
same way; besides which, they saw seven or eight moie at a dis- 
tance, running another way ; for, in a word, they ran every way, like 
sportsmen beating for their ^ame. 

The poor men were now m great perplexity whether they should 
stand and keep their posture, or fly ; but after a very short debate 
with themselves thev considered that if the savages ranged the 
co;:ntry thus before help came, they might perhaps find out their 
I ell eat in the woods, and then all would be lost ; so they resolved to 
stand them there, and if they were too many to deal with, then they 
would get up to the top of the tree, from whence they doubted not to 
defend themselves, fire excepted, as long as their ammunition lasted, 
though all the savages that were landed, which was near fifty, were 
to attack them. 

Having resolved upon this, they next considered whetlffer they 
should fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so take the 
middle party, by which the two and the five that followed would be 
separated : at length they resolved to let the first two pass by, unless 
t hey should spy them in the tree, and come to attack them. The 
first two savages confirmed them also in this resolution by turning a 
little from them toward another part of the wood ; but the three, and 
the five after them, came forward directly to the tree, as if they had 
known the Englishmen were there. Seeing them come so straight 
toward them, they resolved to take them in a line as they came ; 
and as they resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps tlie first shot 




ROBINSON CRUSOE. 261 

might hit them all three ;- for which purpose the man who was to fire 

gut three or four small bullets into his piece ; and having a fair loop- 
ole, as it were, from a broken hole in the tree, be tooli sure aim, 
without being seen, waiting till they were within alwut thirty yards 
of the tree, so that he could not miss. 

While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on, they 
plainly saw that one of the three was the runaway savage that had 
escaped f rota them ; and they both knew him distinctly, and resolved 
that if possible he should not escape though they should both fire : 
so the Other stood ready with his piece, that if he did not drop at the 
first shot he should be sure to have a second. But the first was too 
good a marksman to miss his aim ; for as the savages kept near one 
another, -a little behind in a line, he fired, and hit two of them 
directly : the foremost was killed outright, being shot in the head ; 
the second, which was the runaway Indian, was shot through the body, 
and fell, but was not quite dead*; and the third had a little scratch 
m the shoulder, perhaps by the same ball that went through the 
body of the second ; and being dreadfully frightened, thouffh not so 
much hurt, sat down upon the ground, screaming and yelling in a 
hideous manner. 

The five that were behind, more frightened with the noise than 
sensible of the danger, stood still at first ; for the woods made the 
sound a thousand times bigger than it really was, the echoes rattling 
from one side to another, and the fowis rismg from all parts, scream- 
ing, and every sort making a different noise, according to their kind ; 
just as it was when I fired the first gun that perhaps w^as ever shot 
off in the island. ^ 

However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what the 
matter was, came on unconcerned till they came to the place where 
their companions lay in a condition miserable enough : and here the 
poor ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were within reach of 
the same mischief, stood all together over the wounded man, talking, 
and, as may be supposed, inquiring of him how he came to be hurt ; 
and who, it is very rational to believe, told them that a flash of fire 
first, and immediately after that thunder from their gods, had killed 
those two and wounded him : this, I say, is rational ; for nothing is 
more certain than that, as they saw no man near them, so they had 
never heard a gun in all their lives, nor so much as heard of a gun ; 
neither knew they anything of killing and wounding at a distance 
"With fire and bullets : if they had, one might reasonably believe they 
would not have stood so unconcerned to view the fate or their fellows 
without some apprehensions of their own. 

Our two men, though, as they confessed to me, it grieved them to 
be obliged to kill so many poor creatures who, at the same time, had 
no notion of their danger, yet having them all thus in their power, and 
the first having loaded his piece again, resolved to let fiy both together 
among them ; and singling out, by agreement, which to aim at, they 







2G2 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

shot together and killed, or very much wounded, four of them ; the 
fifth, frightened even to death, though not hurt, fell with the rest ; so 
that our men, seeing them all fall together, thought they had killed 
them hll. 

The belief that the savages were all killed made our two men come 
boldly out from the tree iSfore they had charged theu* guns, which 
was a wrong step ; and they were under some surprise when they 
came to the place and found no less than four of them alive, and of 
them two very little hurt, and one not at all : this obliged them to 
fall upon them with the stocks of their muskets ; and fiist they made 
sure of the runaway savage, that hud been the cause of all the mis^ 
chief, and of another that was hurt in the knee, and put them out of 
their pain : then the man that was not hurt at all came and kneeled 
down to them, with his two hands held up, and made piteous moans 
to them, by gestures and signs, for his life, but could not say one word 
to them that they could understand. However, they made signs to 
him to sit down at the foot of a tree hard by ; and one of the Eng- 
lishmen, with a piece of rope-twine, which he had by great chance 
in his pocket, tied his two hands behind him, and there they left him ; 
and with what speed they could made after the other two, which 
were gone before, fearing they, or any more of them, should find the 
way to their covered place in the woods, where their wives and the 
few goods they had left lay. They came once in sight of the two 
men ; but it was at a great distance ; however, they had the satisfacticm 
to see them cross over a valley toward the sea quite the contrary way 
from that which led to their retreat, which they were afraid of ; and 
being satisfied with that, they went back to the tree where they left 
their prisoner, who, as they supposed, was delivered by his comrades, 
for he was gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn with which they 
had bound him lay just at the foot of the tree. 

They were now in as great concern as before, not knowing what 
course to take, or how near the enemy might be, or in what number ; 
so they resolved to go away to the place where their wives were, to 
see if all was well there, and to make them easy, who were in fright 
enough, to be sure ; for though the savages were their own country- 
men, yet they were most terribly afraid of them, and perhaps the 
more for the knowledge they had of them. 

When they came there, they found the savages had been in the 
wood, and very near that place, but had not found it ; for it was in- 
deed inaccessible, from the treed standing so thick, unless the persons 
seeking it had been directed by those that knew it, which these did 
not : they found, therefore, everything very safe, only the women in 
a terrible fright. While they were here, they had the comfort to 
have seven of the Spaniards come to their assistance ; the other ten. 
with their servants, and old Friday (I mean Friday's father), were 
gone in a body to defend their bower, and the corn and cattle that 
were kept there, in case the savages should have roved over to that 



ROBINSON" CRUSOE. 263 

side of the country ; but they did not spread so far. With the seven 
Spaniards came one of the three savages, who^^as I said, were their 

Srisoners formerly ; and witii them also came the savage whom the 
ingiishman had left bound hand and foot at the tree ; for it seems 
they came that way, saw the slaughter of the seven men, and un- 
bound the eighth, and brought him along with them ; where, how- 
ever, they were obliged to bind him again, as they had the two others 
who were left when the third ran away. 

The prisoners now began to be a burden to them ; and they were 
so afraid of their escaping that they were once resolving to kill them 
all, believing they were under an absolute necessity to do so for their 
own preservation. However, the Spaniard governor would not con- 
sent to it, but ordered, for the present, that thev should be sent out 
of Uie way to my old cave in the valley, and be* kept there, with two 
Spaniards to guard them, and give them food for their subsistence, 
which was done ; and they were bound there, hand and foot, for 
that night. 

When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so encouraged 
that they could not satisfy themselves to stay anv longer there ; but 
taking five of the Spanianis and themselves, with four muskets and 
a pistol among them, and two stout quarter-staves, away they went 
in quest of the savages. And first they came to the tree where the 
men lay that had been killed ; but it was easy to see that some more 
of the savages had been there, for they had attempted to carry their 
dead men away, and had dragged two of them a good way, but had 
given it over. Prom thence they advanced to the first rising ground, 
where they had stood and seen their camp destroyed, and where they 
had the mortification still to see some of the smoke ; but neither 
could they here see any of the savages. They then resolved, though 
with all possible caution, to go forward toward their ruined plantation ; 
but a httle before they came thither, coming in sight of the sea-shore, 
they saw plainly the savages all embarked again in their canoes, in 
order to be gone. They seemed sorry at first, that there was no way 
to come at them, to give them a parting blow ; but upon the whole, 
they were well satisfied to be rid of them. 

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all their im- 
provements destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help them to 
rebuild, and assist them with needful supplies. Their three country, 
men, who were not yet noted for having the least inclination to do 
any good, yet as soon as they heard of it (for they living remote east- 
ward knew nothing of ihe matter till all was over) came and offered 
their help and assistance, and did very friendly work for several days 
Ho restore their habitation and make necessaries for them. Anil ihus 
in a little time they were set upon their legs again. 

About two days after this they had the further satisfaction of 
seeing three of the savages' canoes come driving on shore, and at 
some distance from them two drowned men, by which they had re&jon 



264 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

to believe tbut* they had met with a storm at sea which had overset 
some of them ; for it had blown very hard the night after they went 
off. 

However, as some might miscarry, so, on the other hand, enough of 
them escaped to inform the rest as well of what they had done as of 
what had happened to them, and to whet them on to another enter- 
prise of the same nature, which they, it seems, resolv^ed to attempt 
with sufficient force to carry all before them ; for except what the 
first man had told them of inhabitants, they could say little of it of 
' their own knowledge, for they never paw one man ; and the fellow 
being killed that had afiSrmed it they had no other witness to confirm 
it to them. 

It was five or six months after this before they heard any more of 
the savages, in which time our men were in hopes 1 hey had either 
forgot their former baij luck or given over hopes of better ; when 
on a sudden they were invaded with a most formidable fleet of no less 
than eight-and twenty canoes, full of savages armed with bows and 
arrows, great clubs, wooden swords, and such like engines of war ; 
and they brought such numbers with them that, in short, it put all 
our people into the utmost consternation. 

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the easternmost side 
of the island, our inen had that night to consult and consider what 
to do ; and, in the first place, knowing that their being entirely conr 
cealed was their only safety before, and would be much more so 
now, while the numl>er of their enemies would be so great, they 
therefore resolved, first of all, to take down the huts which were 
built for the two Englishmen, and drive away their goats to the old 
cave ; because they supposed the savages would go directly' thither, 
as soon as it was day, to play the old game over again, though they 
did not now land within two leagues of it. In the next place, they 
drove away all the flocks of goats they had at the old bower, as I 
called it, which belonged to the Spaniards ; and, in short, left as 
little appearance of inhabitants anywhere as was possible ; and the 
next morning early they posted themselves, with all their force, at 
the plantation of the two men, to wait for their coming. As they 
guessed, so it happened : these new invaders, leaving their canoes at 
the east end of the island, came ranging along the shore, directly to- 
ward the place, to the number of two hundred and fifty, as near as 
our men could judge. Our army was but small indeed ; but that 
which was worse, they had not arms for all their number neither.- 
The whole account, it seems, stood thus : first, as to men, seventeen 
Spaniards, five Englishmen, old Friday (or Friday's father), the three 
slaves taken with the women, who proved very faithful, and three 
other slaves, who lived with the Spaniards. To arm these, they had 
eleven muskets, five pistols, three fowling-pieces, five muskets, or 
fowling-piecea, which were taken by me from the mutinous seamen 
whom I reduced, two swords, and three old halberds. 



aOBINSON CBUSOE. 265 

To their slaves they did not give either musket or fusee ; but they 
had each a halberd, or a long staff, like a quarter-staff, with a great 
spike uf iron fastened into each end of it, and by his side a hatchet ; 
also every one of our men had a hatchet. Two of the women could 
not be prevailed upon, but they would come into the fight, and they 
hail bows and arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from the savages 
when tiie first action happened, which I have spoken of, where the 
Indians fought with one another ; and the women had hatchets too. 

The Spaniard governor, whom I have described so often, com- 
manded the whole ; and Will Atkins, who, though a dreadful fellow 
for wickedness, was a most daring, bold fellow, commanded under 
him. The savages came forward like lions ; and our men, which 
was the worst of their fate» had no advantage in their situation ; only 
that Will Atkins, who now proved a most useful fellow, with six men, 
was plant(?d just behind a small thicket of bushes as an advanced 
guard, with orders to let the first of them pass by and then fire into 
the middle of them, and as soon as he had fired to make his retretlt as 
nimbly as he could round a part of the wood, and so come in behind 
the Spaniards, where they stood, having a thi(;ket of trees before them. 

When the savages came on, they ran straggling about every way 
in heaps, out of all manner of order, and Will Atkins let about fifty of 
them pass by him ; then seeing the rest come in a very thick thronff. 
he orders three of his men to nre, having loaded their muskets with 
six or seven bullets apiece, about as big as large pistol bullets. How 
many they killed or wounded they knew not, but the consternation 
and surprise were inexpressible among the savages ; they were 
frightened to the last degree to hear such a dreadful noise and see 
their men killed and i^thers hurt, but see nobody that did; it ; when, 
in the middle of tlien* fright. Will Atkhis and his other three let fly 
again among the thickest of them ; and in less than a minute, the first 
three being loaded again, gave them a third volley. 

Had Will Atkins and his men retired immediately, as soon as they 
had fired, as they were ordered to do, or had the rest of the body 
been at hand to have poured in their shot continually, the savages 
had been effectually routed ; for the terror that was among them 
came principally from this, that they were killed by the gods witii 
thunder and lightning, and could see nobody that hurt them ; but 
Will Atkins, staying to load again, discovered the cheat : some of the 
savages, who were at a distance spying them, came upon them ]^e- 
hind ; and though Atkins and his men fired at them also, two or three 
times, and killed alx)ve twenty, retiring as fast as they could, yet 
they wounded Atkins himself, and killed one of his fellow-English- 
men with their arrows, as they did afterward one Spaniard and one 
of the Indian slaves who came with the women. This slave was a 
most gallant fellow, and fought most desperately, killing five of them 
with his own hand, having no weapon but one of the armed staveg 
and a hatchet

866 KOBINSON CRUSOE. 

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and two other 
men killed, retreated to a rising ground in the wood ; an^ the Span- 
iards, after firing three volleys upon them, retreated also ; for their 
number was so great, and they were so desperate, that though above 
fifty of them were killed, and more than as many wounded, yet they 
came on in the teeth of our men, fearless of danger, and shot their 
arrows like a cloud ; and it was observed that their wounded men, 
who were not quite disabled, were made outrageous by their wounds, 
and fought like madmen. 

Wlien our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the English- 
man that were killed behind them ; and the savages, when they came 
up to them, killed them over again in a wretched manner, breaking 
their arms, legs, and head with their clubs and wooden swords, like 
true savages ; but finding our men were gone, they did not seem to 
pursue them, but drew themselves up in a ring, which is, it seems, 
their custom, and shouted twice, in token of their victory ; after 
whicb they had the mortification to see several of their wounded men 
fall, dying with the mere loss of blood. 

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up together 
upon a rising ground, Atkins, though he was wounded, would have 
had them march and charge again all together at once ; but the 
Spaniard replied, *' Seignior Atkins, you see how their wounded men 
fight ; let them alone till morning ; all the wounded men will be stiff 
and sore with their wounds, and faint with the loss of blood ; and so 
we shall have the fewer to engage." This advice was good ; but Will 
Atkins replied merrily, ** That is true, seignior, and so shall I too ; 
and that is the reason I would go on while I am warm." '* Well, 
Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, " you have behaved gallantly, 
and done your part ; we will fight for you if you cannot come on ; 
but I think it best to stay till m~orning ;" so they waited. 

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they found the savages 
in a great disorder about their dead and wounded men, and a great 
noise and hurry among them where they lay, they afterward re- 
solved to fall upon them in the night ; especially if they could come 
to give them but one volley before they were discovered, which they 
had a fair opportunity to do ; for one of the Englishmen, in whose 
quarter it was where the fight began, led them round between the 
woods and the sea-side westward, and then turning ^hurt south, they 
came so near where the thickest of them lay, that, before they were 
seen or heard, eight of them fired in upon them, and did dreadful 
execution upon them ; in half a minute more eight others fired after 
them, pouring in their small shot in such a quantity that abundance 
were killed and wounded , and all this while they were not al)le to. 
see who hurt them, or which way to fly. 

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition, and then 
divided themselves into three bodies, and resolved to fall in amon^^ 
them all together. They had in each body eight persons, that is Uy 



BOMNSON CRUSOE. 267 

say, twenty-two men and the two women, who, by the way, fought 
desperately. They divided the firearms equally m each party, as 
well as til e halberds and staves. They would have had the women 
kept back, but they said they were resolved to die with their hus- 
bands. Having thus formea their little army, they marched out 
from among the trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy, shout- 
ing and hallooing as loud as they could ; the savages stood all to- 
gether, but were in the utmost confusion, hearing the noise of our 
men shouting from three quarters together : they would have fought 
if they had seen us ; for as soon as we came near enough to be seen, 
some arrows were shot, and po^r old Friday was wounded, thouirli 
not dangerously ; but our men gave them no tiiue, but, running up 
to them, fired among them three ways, and then fell in with the butt- 
ends of their muskets, their swords, armed staves, and hatchets, and 
laid about them so well that, in a word, they set up a dismal scream- 
ing and howling, flying to save their lives which way soever they 
could. 

Our men were tired with the execution, and killed or mortally 
wounded in the two fights %bout one hundred and eighty of them ; 
the rest, being frightened out of their wits, scoured through the- 
woods and over the hills, with all the speed fear and nimble feet 
could help them to ; and as we did not. trouble ourselves much to 
pursue them, they got all together to the sea-side where they landed 
and where their canoes lay. But their disaster was not at an end 
yet ; for it blew a terrible storm of wind that evening from the sea, 
so that it was impossible for them to go off ; -nay, the storm continu- 
ing all night, when the tide came up, their canoes were most of them 
driven by the surge of the sea so high upon the shore that it requirei 
infinite toil to get them off ; and some of them were even daslied to 
pieces against the beach, or against one another. 

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little rest that 
night ; but having refreshed themselves as well as they could, they 
resolved to march to that part of the island where the savages were 
fled, and see what posture they were in. This necessarily led them 
over the place where the fight had been, and where they found 
several of the poor creatures not quite dead, aud yet past recovering 
life ; a sight disagreeable enough to generous minds, for a truly great 
man, though obliged by the law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes 
no delight in his misery. However, there was no need to give any 
orders in this case ; for their own savaires, who were their servants, 
dispatched these poor creatures with their hatchets. 

At lengtli they came in view of the place where the more miserable 
remains of the savages* army lay, where there appeared about a hun- 
dred still ; their posture was generally sitting upon the ground, with 
their knees up toward their mouth, and the head put between the 
two hands, leaning down upon the knees. 

When our men came within two musket-shots of them, the Span- 



268 BOBIKSON CRUSOE. 

iard governor ordered two muskets to be fired, without ball, to alarm 
them : tbis he did, that by their countenance he might know what 
to expect, whether they were still in heart to fight, or were so 
heartily beaten as to be dispirited and discouraged, and so he might 
manage accordingly. This stratagem took ; for as soon as the 
savages heard the first gun, and saw the flash of the second, they 
started up upon their feet in the greatest consternation imaginable ; 
and as our men advanced swiftly toward them, they all ran screaming 
and yelling away, with a kind of howling noise, which our men did 
not understand, and had never heard before ; and thus they ran up 
the hills into the country. * 

At first our men had much rather the weather had been calm, and 
they had all gone away to sea ; but they did not then consider that 
this might probably have been the occasion of their coming again in 
such multitudes as not to be resisted, or at least to come so many 
and so often as would quite desolate the island and starve them. 
Will Atkins, therefore, who, notwithstanding his wound, kept al- 
ways with them, proved the best counsellor in this case : his advice 
was, to take the advantage that offered, and step in between them and 
their boats, and so deprive them of the capacity of ever returning any 
more to plague the island. 

They consulted long about this ; and some were against it for fear 
of mafeing the wretches fly to the woods and live there desperate, and 
so they should have them to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid to stir 
out aliout their business, and have their plantations continually rifled, 
all their tame goats destroyed, and, in short, be reduced to a life of 
continual distress. 

Will Atkins told them they had better have to do with a hundred 
men than with a hundred nations ; that as they must destroy their 
boats, so they must destroy the men, or be all of them destroyed 
themselves. In a word, he showed them the necessity of it so 
plainly that they all came into it ; so they went to work immediately 
with the boats, and getting some dry world together from a dead tree, 
they tried to set some of them on fire, but they were so wet that they 
would not burn ; however, the fire so burned the upper part that it 
soon made them unfit for swimming in the sea as boats. -When the 
Indians saw what they were about, some of them came running out 
of the woods, and coming as near as they could to our men, kneeled 
down and cried, " Oa, Oa. Waramokoa," and some other words of 
their language, which none of the others understood anything of ; 
but as they made pitiful gestures and strange noise?, it was easy to 
understand they begged to have their boats spared, and that they 
would be gone, and never come there again. But our men were now 
satisfied that they had no way to preserve themselves, or to save their 
colony, but effectually to prevent any of these people from ever goins^ 
home again, depending upon this, that if even so much as one of 
them got back into their country to tell the story, the colony was ua-

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3G9 

done ; so that letting them know that they should not have any mercy 
they fell to work with their canoes, and destroyed every one that the 
storm had not destroyed before ; at the sight of which the savages 
raised a hideous cry in the woods, which our people heard plain 
enough, after which they ran about the island like distracted men, 
so that, in a word, our men did not really know what at first to do 
with them. Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, consider 
that while they made those people thus desperate, they ought to have 
kept a good guard at the same time upon their plantations ; for 
though, it is true, they had driven away their cattle, and the Indians 
did not find out their main retreat (I mean my old castle at the hill), 
nor the cave in the valley, yet they found out my plantation at the 
bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences and planting 
about it ; trod all the corn under foot, tore up the vines and grapes, 
being just then almost ripe, and did our men an inestimable damage, 
though to themselves not one farthing's worth of service. 

Though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions, yet, 
they were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt them up and 
down ; for as they were too nimble of foot for our men when they 
found them single, so our men dtirst not go abroad single, for fear 
of being surrounded with their numbers. The best was, they had 
no weapons ; for though they had bows, they had no arrows left, 
nor any materials to make any ; nor had they any edge-tool or weapon 
among them. 

The extremity and distress they were reduced to was great, and 
indeed deplorable ; but, at the same time, our men were also brought 
to very bad circumstances by them, for though their retreats were 
preserved, yet their provision was destroyed, and their harvest 
spoiled, and what to do, or which way to turn themselves, they knew 
not. The only refuge they had now was the stock of cattle they 
had in the valley by the cave, and some little corn which grew there, 
and the plantation of the three Englishmen, Will Atkins and his 
comrades, who were now reduced to two, one of them being killed 
by an arrow, which struck him on the side of his head, just under 
the temples, so that he never spoke more ; and it was very remark- 
able that this was the same barbarous fellow that cut the poor savage 
slave with Jiis hatchet, and who afterward intended to have murdered 
the Spaniards. 

I looked upon their case to have been worse at this time than mine 
was at any time after I first discovered the grains of barley and rice, 
and got into the manner of planting and raising my corn, and my 
tame cattle ; for now they had, as I may saw, a hundred wolves upon 
the island, which would devour everything they could come at, yet 
could be hardly come at themselves. 

When they saw what their circumstances were, the first thing Ihey 
concluded was, that they would, if possible, drive them up to the 
farther part of the island, south-west, that if any more savages came 



270 BOBINSON CRUSOE, 

on shore they might not find one another ; then, that they would 
daily hunt and harass them, and kill as many of them as they could 
come at, till they had reduced their niunber ; and if they could at last 
tame them, and bring them to anything, they would give them corn 
and teach them how to plant, and live upon their daily labor. 

In order to this, they so followed ihem, and so terrified them 
with their guns, that in a few days, if any of them fired a gun at an 
Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he would fall down for fear ; and 
so dreadfully frightened they were that they kept out of sight farther 
and farther ; till at last, our men following Ihem, and almost every 
day killing or wounding some of them, they kept up in the woods or 
hollow places so much that it reduced them to the utmost misery 
for want of food ; and* many were afterward found dead m the woods 
without any hurt, absolutely starved to death. 

When our men found this, it made their hearts relent, and pity 
moved them, especially the Spaniard governor, Who was the most 
gentlemanlike, generous-minded man that I ever met with in my 
life ; and he proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive, and 
bring him to understand what they meant, so far as to be able to act 
as interpreter, and go among them, and see if they might be brought 
to some conditions that might be depended upon to save their lives 
and do us no harm. 

It was some while before any of them could be taken ; but being 
weak and half -starved, one of them was at last sui-prised and made a 
prisoner. He was sullen at first, and would neither eat nor drink ; 
but finding himself kindly used, and victuals given to him, and no 
violence offered him, he at last grew tractable, and came to himself. 
They brought old Friday to him, who talked often with him, and told 
him how kind the others would be to them all ; that they would not 
only save their lives, but give them part of the island to live in, pro- 
vided they would give satisfaction that they would keep in their own 
bounds, and not come beyond it to injure or prejudice others ; and 
that they should have corn given them to plant and make it grow for 
their bread, and some bread given them for their present subsist- 
ence : and old Friday bade the fellow go and talk with the rest of 
his countrymen, and see what they said to it, assuring them tliat if 
they did not agree immediately they should be all destroyed. 

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in number 
to about thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at the first offer, and 
begged to have some food given them ; upon which twelve Span- 
iards and two Englishmen, well armed, with three Indian slaves and 
old Friday, marched to the place where they were. The three Indian 
slaves carried them a large quantity of bread, some rice boiled up to 
cakes and dried in the sun, and three live goats ; and they were or- 
dered to go to the side of a hill, where they sat down, ate their pro- 
visions very thankfully, and were the most faithful fellows to their 
words that could be thought of ; for except when they came U) beg 



ROBINSOIS' CRUSOE. 271 

victuals and directions, they never came out of their bounds ; and 
there they lived when I came to the island, and I went to see them. 

The}' had taught them both to plant corn, make bread, breed tame 
goats, and milk them : they wanted nothing but wives, and they 
soon would have been a nation. They were confined to a neck of 
land, surrounded with high rocks behind them, and lying plain to- 
ward the sea before them, on the south-east corner of the island. 
They had land enough, and it was very good and fruitful ; about a 
mile and a half broad and three or four miles in length. 

Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such as I made for 
myself, and gave among them twelve hatchets and three or four 
knives ; and there they lived, the most subjected, innocent creatures 
that ever were heard of. 

After tljiis the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity, with respect 
to the savages, till I came to revisit them, which was about two years 
after ; not but that, now and then, some canoes of savages came on 
shore for their triumphal, unnatural feasts ; but as they were of sev- 
eral nations, and perhaps had never heard of those that came before, 
or the reason of it, they did not make any search or inquiry aft^r 
their countrymen ; and if they had, it would have been very hard to 
have found them out. 

Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all that happened to 
them till my return, at least that was worth notice. The Indians or 
savages were wonderfully civilized by them, and they frequently 
went among them ; but forbid, on pain of death, any one of the In- 
dians coming to them, because they would Jiot have their settlement 
betrayed again. One thing was very remarkable, viz., that they 
taught the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets, but they soon, 
outdid their masters ; for they made abundance of moat ingenious 
things in wicker-work, particularly of all sorts of baskets, sieves, 
bird-cages, cupboards, etc. ; as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds, 
couches, and abundance of other things ; being very ingenious at 
such work when they were once put in the way of it. 

My coming was a particular relief to these people, because we f ur-^ 
nished them with knives, scissors, spades, shovels, pickaxes, and all 
things of that kind which they could want. With the help of those, 
tools thej" were so very handy that they came at last to build up their 
huts or houses very handsomely, raddling or working it up like 
basket-work all the way round ; which was a very extraordinary 
piece of ingenuity, and looked very odd, but was au exceeding good 
fence as well against heat as against all sorts of vermin ; and our men 
were so taken with it that they got the wild savages to come and do 
the like for them ; so that when 1 came to see the two Englishmen's 
colonies they looked, at a distance, as if they all lived like bees in a 
hive. As for Will Atkins, who was now become a very industrious, 
useful, and sober fellow, he had made himself such a tent of basket- 
work as. I befieye, was never seen | it was one hundred and twenty 



273 



BOBINSON CRUSOE. 



paces round on the outside, as I measured by my steps ; the walls 
were as close worked as a basket^ in panels or squares of thirty -two 
in number, and very strong, standing about seven feet high ; in the 
middle was another, not above twenty-two paces round, but built 
stronger, being octagon in its form, and in the eight corners stood 
eight very strong posts ; round the top of which he laid strong 
pieces, pinned together with wooden pins, from which he raised a 
i>yramid for a roof of eight rafters, very handsome, I assure you, and 
joined together very well, though he had no nails, and only a few 
iron spikes, which he made himself too out of the old iron that I had- 
left there ; and, indeed, this fellow showed abundance of ingenuity 
in several things which he had no knowledge of : he made him a 
forge, with a pair of wooden bellows to blow the fire ; he made him- 
self charcoal for his work ; and he formed out of the iron crows a 
middling good anvil to hammer upon : in this manner he made many 
things, but especially hooks, staples, and spikes, bolts, and himres. 
But to return to the house : after he had pitched the roof of his inner- 
most tent, he worked it up between the rafters with basket-work, 
so firm, and thatched that over again so ingeniously with rice-straw, 
and over that a large leaf of a tree which covered the top, that his 
house was as dry as if it had been tiled or slated. Indeed, he owned 
that the savages had made the basket-work for him. The outer cir- 
cuit was covered as a lean-to, all round this inner apartment, and long 
rafters lay from the thirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner 
house, being about twenty feet distant, so that there was a space like 
a walk within the outer wicker-wall and without the inner, near 
twenty feet wide. 

The inner place he partitioned off with the same wicker-work, but 
much fairer, and divided into six apartments, so that he had six 
rooms on a floor, and out of every one of these there was a door ; 
first, into the entry, or coming into the main tent, and another door 
into the space or walk that was round it ; so that walk was also 
divided into six equal parts, which served not only for a retreat, but 
to store up any necessaries which the family had occasion for. 
These six spaces not taking up the whole circumference, what other 
apartments the outer circle had were thus ordered : As soon as you 
were in at the door of the outer circle, you had a short passage 
straight before you to the door of the inner house ; but on either side 
was a wicker partition, and a door in it by which you went first into 
a krge room or storehouse, twenty feet wide and about thirty feet 
long, and through that into another not quite so long ; so that in the 
outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which were only to be 
come at through the apartments of the inner tent, and served as 
closets or retiring-rooms to the respective chambers of the inner cir- 
cle ; and four large warehouses, or barns, or what you please to call 
them, which went through one another, two on either hand of the 
passage, that led through tlie outer door to the inner tent. 



BOBINSOK CRUSOE. 273 

Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never seen in the 
world, nor a house or tent so neatly contrived, much less so built. 
In this great beehive lived the three families— that is so say, Will 
Atkins and his companion ; the third was killed, but his wife re- 
mained with three children, for she was, it seems, big with child 
when he died ; and the other two were not at all backward to give 
the widow her full share of everything, I mean as to their corn, milk, 
grapes, etc., and -when they killed a kid, or found a turtle on the 
shore ; so that they all lived well enough ; though it was true they 
were not so industrious as the other two, as has been observed 
already. 

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz., that as for religion, I 
do not know that there was anything of that kind among them ; they 
often, indeed, put one another in mind that there was a God by the 
very common method of seamen, swearing by his name ; nor were 
Iheir poor ignorant savage wives much better for having been mar- 
ried to Christians, as we must call them ; for as they knew very lit- 
tle of God themselves, so they were utterly incapable of entering 
into any discourse with their wives about a God, or to talk anything 
to them concerning religion. 

The utmost of all the improvement which I can say the wives had 
made from them was, that they had taught them to speak English 
pretty well ; and most of their children, who were near twenty in 
all, were taught to speak English too, from their first learning to 
speak, though they at first spoke it in a very broken manner, like their 
mothers. There was none of these children above six years old 
when I came thither, for it was not much above seven years since 
they had fetched these five savage ladies over ; but they had all been 
pretty fruitful, for they had ^11 children more or less : I think the 
cook's mate 8 wife was big of her sixth child ; and the mothers were 
all a good sort of well-governed, cjuiet, laborious women, modest and 
decent, helpful to one another, mighty observant and subject to their 
masters (I cannot call them husbands), and wanted nothing but to be 
well instructed in the Christian religion, and to be legally married ; 
both which were happily brought about afterward by my means, or 
at least in consequence of my coming among them. 

Having thus given an account of the colony in general, and pretty 
much of my runagate English, I must say something of the Span- 
iarcfs, who were the mainbody of the family, and in whose story 
there are some incidents also remarkable enough. 

I had a great many discourses with them about their circumstances 
when they were among the savages. They told me readily that they 
had no instances to give of their application or ingenuity in that 
country ; that they were a poor, miserable, dejected handful of peo- 
ple ; that if means had been put into their hands, yet they had so 
abandoned themselves to despair, and so sunk under the weight of 
their misfortune, that they thought of nothing but starving. One of 



•t--

them, a grave and sensible man, told me he was convinced they were 
in ihe wrong ; that it was not the part of wise men to give them- 
selves up to their misery, i)ut always to take hold of the helps which 
reason offered, as well for present support as for future deliverance : 
he told me that grief was the most senseless, insignificant passion in 
the world, for that it regarded only things past, which were generally 
impossible to be recalled or to be remedied, bat had no views of 
things to come, and had no share in anything that looked like deliv- 
erance, but rather added to the affliction than proposed a remedy ; 
and upon this he repeated a Spanish proverb, which though I cannot 
repeat in just the same words that he spoke it in, yet I remember I 
made it into an English proverb of my own, thus : 

In trouble to be troubled, 

Is to have your trouble doubled. 

He ran on then in remarks upon all the little improvements i had 
made in my solitude f my imwearied application, as he called it ; and 
how I had made a condition which in its circumstances was at first 
much worse than theirs, a thousand times more happy than theirs 
was, even now when they were all together. He told me it was re- 
markable that Englishmen had a greater presence of mind« in their 
distress, than any people that he ever met with ; that their unhappy 
nation and the Portuguese were the worst men in the world to strug- 
gle with misfortunes ; for that their first step in dangers, after the 
common efforts were over, was to despair, lie down under it, and die, 
without rousing their thoughts up to proper remedies for escape. 

I told him their case and mine differed exceedingly ; that they 
were cast upon the shore without necessaries, without supply of 
food, or present sustenance till they could provide for it ; that, it 
was true, I had this disadvantage and discomfort, that I was alone ; 
but then the supplies I had providentially thrown into my hands, by 
the unexpected driving of the ship on shore, was such a help as 
would have encouraged any creature in the worfB to have applied 
himself as I had done. "Seignior," says the Spaniard, ** had we 
poor Spaniards been in your case, we should never have got half 
those things out of the ship as you did : nay," says he, *' we should 
never have found means to have got a raft to carry them, or to 
have got the raft on shore without boat or sail ; and how much less 
should we have done if any of us had been alone !" Well, I desired 
him to abate his compliments and go on with the history of their 
coming on shore, where they landed. He told nae they unhappily 
landed at a place where there were people without provisions ; 
whereas, had they common-sense to put off to sea again and gone to 
another island a little farther, they had found provisions, though 
without people ; there being an island that way, as they had been 
told, where there were wovisions, though no people ; that is to say, 
that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been there and had 
filled the island with goats and hogs at several times, where they had 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 275 

bred in such multitudes and where turtle and sea-foT^s were io 
such plenty that they could have been in no want of flesh, though 
they had found no bread ; whereas, here they were only sustained 
with a few roots and herbs which they understood not, and which 
had no substance in them, and which the inhabitants gave them 
sparingly enough ; and they could treat them no better, unless they 
would turn cannibals and eat men's llesh, which was the great dainty 
of their country. 

They gave me an account how many ways they strove to civilize 
the savages they were with, and to teach tnem rational customs in 
the ordinary way of living, but in vain ; and how they retorted it 
upon them as unjust that they, who came there for assistance and 
support, should attempt to ^et up for instructors of those that gave 
them food ; intimating, it seems, that none should set up for the in- 
structors of others but those who could live without them. 

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they were driven 
to ; how sometimes they were many days without any food at all, 
the island they were upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that 
lived more indolent, and for that reason were less supplied with the 
necessaries of life than they had reason to believe others were in the 
same part of the world : and yet they found that these savages were 
less ravenous and voracious than those who had better supplies of 
food. Also they added, they could not but see with what demon- 
strations of wisdom and goodness the governing providence f)f God 
directs the events of things in this world i which, they said, ap- 
peared in their circumstances ; for if, pressed by the hardships they 
were under, and the barrenness of the country where they were, they 
had seal died after a better to live in, they had then been out of the 
wav of the relief that happened to them by my means. 

They then gave me an account how the savages whom they lived 
among expected them to so out with them into their wars ; and it 
Was true, that as they had firearms with them, had they not had the 
disaster to lose their ammunition, they could have been servieeable 
not only to their friends, but have made themselves terrible both to 
friends and enemies ; but being without powder and shot, and yet in a 
condition that they could not in reason deny to go out with their 
landlords to their wars, so when they came into the field of battle 
they were in a worse condition than the savages themselves, for they 
had neither bows nor arrows, nor could they use those the savages 
gave them : so they could do nothing but stand still and be wounded 
with arrows; till they came up to the teeth of their enemy; and 
then, indeed, the three halberds they had were of use to them ; and 
they would often drive a whole little army before them with those 
halberds and sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their muskets : 
but that, for all this, they were sometimes surrounded with multitudes 
and in great danger from their arrows, till at last they found the way 
to make themselves large targets of wood, which they covered with 



276 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

skins of ^Id beasts, whose names tbey knew not, and these covered 
them from the arrows of the savages : that, notwithstanding these, 
tbey were sometimes in great danger ; and live of them were once 
knocked down together with the clubs of the savages, which was the 
time when one of them was taken prisoner— rtb at is to sjiy, the Spaniard 
whom I relieved : that at first they thought he had been killed ; but 
when they afterward beard he was ta^en prisoner they were under 
the greatest grief imaginable, and would willingly have all ventured 
their lives to have rescued him. 

They told me that when they were so knocked down, the rest of 
their company rescued them, and stood over them fighting till they 
Were come to themselves, all but him who they thought had been 
dead ; and then they made their way with their halberds and pieces 
standing close together in a line, through a body of above a thou- 
sand savages, beatmg down all that came in their way, got the victory 
over their enemies, but to their great sorrow, because it was with the 
loss of their friend, whom the other party, finding alive, carried off, 
with some others, as I gave an accoimt before. 

They described most affectionately how they were surprised with 
joy at the return of their friend and companion in miserj', who they 
thought had been devoured by wild beasts of the worst kind — wild 
men ; and yet, how more and more they were surprised with the ac- 
count he gave them of his en-and, and thai there was a Christian in 
anj'^ place near, much more one that was able and had humanity 
enough to contribute to their deliverance. 

They described how they were astonished at the sight of the relief 
I sent them, and at the appearance of loaves of bread — things they 
had not seen since their coming to that miserable place ; how often 
they crossed it and blessed it as bread sent from heaven ; and what a 
reviving cordial it was to their spirits to taste it, as also the other 
things I had sent for their supply ; and, after all, lliey would have 
told me something of the joy they were in at the sight of a boat and 
pilots to carry them away to the person and place from whence all 
these new comforts came ; but it was impossible to express it by 
words, for their excessive joy naturally driving them to unbecoming 
extravagances, they had no way to describe them but by telling me 
they bordered upon lunacy, having no way to give vent to their pas- 
sions suitable to the sense that was upon them ; that in some it 
worked one way, and in some another ; and that some of them, 
through a surprise of joy, would burst into tears, others be stark mad, 
and others immediately faint. This discourse extremely affected 
me, and called to mv mind Friday's ecstasy when he met his father, 
and the poor people s ecstasy when I took them up at sea after their 
ship was on fire ; the joy of the mate of the ship when he found him- 
self delivered in the place where he expected to perish ; and my'own 
joy when, after twenty-eight years* captivity, I found a jrood ship 
ready to carry me to my own country. All these things mftdc mo 



ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 277 

more sensible of the relation of these poor men, and more affected 
with it. 

Having thus ffiven a view of the state of things as I found them, I 
must relate the heads of what I did for these people, and the condi- 
tion ih which I left them. It was their opinion, and mine too, that 
they would be troubled no more with the savages, or if they were, 
they would be able to cut them off, if they were twice as many as 
before ; so they had no concern about that. Then I entered into a 
Berious discourse with the Spaniard, whom I call governor, about 
their stay in the island ; for as I was not come to carry any of them 
off, so it would not be just to carry off some and leave others, who, 
perhaps, would be unwilling to stay if their strength was dimin- 
ished. On the other hand, I told them I came to establish them 
there, not to remove them ; and then I let them know that I had 
brought with me relief of sundry kind for them ; that I had been at a 
great charge to supply them with all things necessary, as well for 
their convenience as their defence ; and that I had such and such 
partipular persons with mo, as well to increase and recruit their nuin- 
bcr, as by the particular necessary employments which they 
were bred to, being artificers, to assist them in those things in which 
at present they were in want. 

They were all together when I talked thus to them ; and before I 
delivered to them the stores I had brought, I asked them, one by 
one, if they had entirely forgot and buried the first animosities that 
had been among tbem, and would shake bauds with one another, and 
engage in a strict friendship and union of interest that so there might 
be no more misunderstandings and jealousies. 

Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and good-humor, said 
they had met with affliction enough to make them all sober, and ene- 
mies enough to make them all friends ; that, for his part, he would 
live and die with them, and was so far from designin<j anything 
against the Spaniards that he owned they had done nothing to him 
but what his own mad humor made necessary, and what he would 
have done, and perhaps worse, in their case ; and that he would ask 
them pardon, if I desired it, for the foolish and brutish things he had 
done to them, and was very willing and desirous of living in terms of 
^ntire friendship and union with them, and would do anything that 
lay in his power to convince them of it ; and us for going to Eng- 
land, he cared not if he did not go thither these twenty years. 

The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at first disarmed and ex- 
cluded Will Atkins and his two countrymen for their ill conduct, as 
they had let me know, and they appealed to me for the necessity 
they were under to do so ; but that Will Atkins had behaved him- 
self so bravely in the great fight they had with the savages, and On 
several occasions since, and had showed himself so faithful to and 
concerned for the general interest of them all, that they had forgot- 
ten all that was passed, and thought he merited as much to be 






278 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

trusted with arms and supplied with necessaries as any of them ; and 
they had testified their satisfaction in him by committing tlje com.- 
mapd to him next to the governor himself ; and as th^^y had entire 
confidence in him and all his countrymen, so they acknowledged 
they had merited that confidence by all the methods tbat honest mtin 
could merit to be valued and trusted ; and they most heartily em- 
braced the occasion of giving me this assurance, that they would 
never have any interest separate from one another. 

Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship we appointed 
the next day to dine all together ; and, indeed, we made a splendid 
feast. I caused the ship's cook and his mate to come on shore and 
dress our dinner, and the old cook's mate we had on shore assisted. 
We brought on shore six pieces of good beef and four pieces of pork 
out of the ship's provisions, with our punch-bowl, and materials to 
fill it ; and, in particular, I gave them ten bottles of French claret 
and ten bottles of English beer ; things that neither the Spaniards 
nor the English had tasted for many years, and which it nmy be 
supposed they were very glad of. The Spaniards added to our feast 
five whole kids, which the cooks roasted ; and three of them were 
sent covered up close on board the ship to the seamen, that they might 
feast on fresh meat from on t^hore, as we did with their salt meat from 
on board. 

After tfiis feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I 
brought my cargo of goods ; wherein, that there might be no dispute 
about dividing, 1 showed them that there was a sufficiency for them 
all, desiring that they might all take an^ equal quantity of the goods 
that were for wearini^ ; that is to say, equal when made up : as 
first 1 distributed linen sufficient to make every one of them four 
shirts, and, at the Spaniard's request, afterward made them up six ; 
these were exceeding comfortable to them, having been what thev 
had long since forgot the use of, or what it was to wear them. T 
allotted the thin English stuffs, which I mentioned before, to make 
every oixe a light coat, like a frock, which liudged fittest for the heat 
of the season, cool and loose ; and ordered that whenever they de- 
cayed, they should make more as they thought fit ; the like for 
pumps, shoes, stockings, hats, etc. 

I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction sat upon the 
countenances of all these poor men when they saw the care I had* 
taken of them, and how well I had furnished them. They told me I 
was a father to them ; and that having such a correspondent as I was 
in so remote a part of the world, it would make them forget that 
they were left in a desolate place ; and the/ all voluntarily engaged 
to me not to leave the place without my consent, 
r Then I presented to them the people I had brought with me, par- 
ticularly the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters, all of them 
most necessary people ; but, above all, my general artificer, thAO 
whom they could not name anything that was more useful to them ; 



ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 27d 

and the tailor, to show his concern for them, went to work imme- 
diately, and with my leave made them every one a shirt the fii*st 
thing he did ; and, what was still more, he taught the women not 
only how to sew and stitch and use the needle, but made them assist 
to make the shirts for their husbands and for all the rest. 

As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they were ; 
for they took to pieces all my clumsy, unhandy things, .and made 
clever, convenient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, 
shelves, and everything they wanted of that kind. But to let them 
see how nature made artificers at first, I carried the carpenters to see 
Will Atkins* basket-house, as I called it ; and they both owned they 
Bever saw an instance of such natural ingenuity before, nor anything 
so regular and so handily built, at least of its kind ; and one 
of them, when he saw it, after musing a good while, turning about 
to me, '* I am sure," says he, " that man has no need of us ; you 
need do nothing but give him tools/* 

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave every man 
a digging-spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had no harrows or 
plough ; and to every separate place a pickaxe, a crow, a broad axe, 
and a saw ; always appointing, that as often as any were broken or 
worn out, they should be supplied without grudging, out of the gen- 
eral stores that I left behind. Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chis- 
els, knives, scissors, and all sorts of iron-work, they had without re- 
serve as they required ; for no man would take more than he wanted, 
and he must be a fool that would waste or spoil them on any account 
whatever ; and for the use of the smith I left two tons of unwrought 
iron for a supply. 

Mymagazme of powder and arms which I brought them was such, 
even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice at them ; for now 
they could march as I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder, 
if there was occasion'; and were able to fight a thousand savages, if 
they had but some little advantages of situation, which also they 
could not miss if they had occasion. 

I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother was 
starved to death, and the maid also : she was a sober, well-educated, 
religious young woman, and behaved so inoffensively that every one 
gave her a good word ; she had, indeed, an unhappy life with us, 
there being no woman in the ship but herself, but she bore it with 
patience. After a while, seeing things so well ordered, and ir; so 
fine, a way of thriving upon my island, and considering that they 
had neither business nor acquaintance in the East Indies, or reason 
for taking so long a voyage, both of them came to me and desired I 
^ould g:ive them leave to remain on the island, and be entered among 
my family, as they called it. I agreed to this readily ; and they had 
a little plot of ground allotted to them, where they had three tents or 
houses set up,, surrounded with a basket-work, palisadoed like Atkins', 
adjoining to. his plantation. Their tents were contrived so that^hey^ 



Li. 



280 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

had each of them a room apart to lodge in, and a middle tent like a 
great storehouse to lay their goods in and to eat and drink in. And 
now the other two Englishmen removed their habitation to the same 
place ; and so the island was divided into three colonies and no more, 
viz., the Spaniards, with old Friday and the first servants at my old 
habitation under the hill, which was, in a word, the capital city, and 
where they had so enlarged and extended their works, as well under 
as on the outside of the hill, that they lived, thouffh perfectly con- 
cealed, yet full at large. Never was there such a little city in a wood, 
and so hid in any part of the world ; for I verily believe that a thou- 
sand men might have ranged the island a month, and, if they had not 
known there was such a thing and looked on purpose for it, they 
would not have found it ; for the trees stood so thick and so close 
and grew so fast woven one into another that nothing but cutting 
them down first could discover theplace, except the only two narrow 
entrances where they went in and out could be found, which ^was not 
very easy ; one of them was close down at the water's edge on the 
side of the creek, and it was afterward above two hundred yards to 
the place ; and the other was up a ladder at twice, as I have already 
described it ; and they had also a large wood thickly planted on the 
top of the hill, containing above an acre, which grew apace and con- 
cealed the place from all discovery there, with only one narrow place 
between two trees not easily to be discovered to enter on that side. 

The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where there were four 
families of Englishmen ~I mean those I had left there with their 
wives and children ; three savages that were slaves, the widow and 
the children of the Englishman that was killed, the young man and 
the maid, and, by the way, we made a wife of her before we went 
away. There were also the two carpenters and the tailor whom I 
brought with me for them ; also the smith, who was a very neces- 
sary roan to them, especially as a gunsmith to take care of their 
arms ; and my other man, whom I called Jack-of-all-trades, who 
was in himseli as good almost as twenty men ; for he was not only a 
very ingenious fellow but a very merry fellow, and before I went 
away we married him to the honest maid that came with the youth 
in the ship I mentioned before. 

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to say some- 
thing of the French ecclesiastic that I had brought with me out of 
the ship's crew whom I took up at sea. It is true this man was a 
Boman, and perhaps it may give offence to some liereafter if I leave 
anything extraordinary upon record of a man whom, before I begin, 
I must (to set him out in just colors) represent in terms very much to 
his disadvantage in the account of Protestants ; as, first, that he was 
a Papist ; secoiidly, a Popish priest ; and, thirdly, a French Popish 
priest. But justice demands of me to give him a due character ; and 
I must say he was a grave, sober, pious, and most religious person ; 
exact in his life, extensive in his charity, and exemplary in almost 



■I. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 281 

erer^tbing he did. What then can any one say against being very 
sensible of the value of such a man, notwithstanding his profession f 
though it may be my opinion perhaps, as well as tlie opinion of others 
who shall read this, that he was. mistaken. 

The first hour that I began to converse with him after he had 
agreed to go with me to the East Indies I found reason to delight ex- 
ceedingly in his conversation ; and he first began with me about 
religion in the most obliging manner imaginable. '* 8ir/' says he, 
** you have not only under God (and at that he crossed his breast) 
saved my life, but you have admitted me to go this voyage in your 
ship, and by your obliging civility have talcen me into your family, 
giving me an opportunity of free conversation. Now, sir, you see by 
my habit what my profession is, and I guess by your nation what 
yours is ; I may think it is my duty — and doubtless it is so — to use 
my utmost endeavors on all occasions to bring all the souls I can to 
the knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the Catholic doctrine ; 
hot as I am here under your permission and in four family, I am 
bound in justice to your kindness, as well as in decency and good 
manners, to be under your government ; and therefore 1 shall not, 
without your leave, enter into any debate on the points of religion in 
which we may not agree, farther than you shall give me leave." 

I told him his carriage was so modest that I could not but acknowl- 
edge it ; that it was true we were such people as they call heretics, 
but that he was not the first Catholic I had conversed with without 
falling into inconveniences, or carrying the questions to any height 
in debate ; that he should not find himself the worse used for being 
of a different opinion from us, and if we did not converse without 
any dislike on either side, it should be his fault, not ours. 

He replied that he thought all our conversation might be easily* 
separated from disputes ; that it was not his business to cap princi- 
ples with every man he conversed with, and that he rat her desired me 
to converse with'jhim as a gentleman than as a religionist ; and that, 
if I would give him leave at any time to discourse upon religious sub- 
jects, he would readily comply with it, and that he did not doubt but 
1 v/ould allow him also to defend his own opinions as well as he 
could ; but that without my leave he would not break in upon me 
with any audi tiling. He told me further that he would not cease to 
do all tiiat became him, in his office as a priest as well as a private * 
Christian, to procure the good of the ship and the safety of all that 
was in her ; and though perhaps we would not join with him and 
he could not pray with us, he hoped he might pray for us, which he 
would do upon all occasions. In this manner we conversed ; and as 
he was of the most obliging, gentlemanlike behavior, so he was, if I 
may be allowed to say so, a man of good sense, and, as I believe, of 
great learning. 

He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of the many 
extraordinary events of it ; of many adventures which had befallen

r 

him in the few years that he had been abroad in the woiid ; said 
particularly it was very remarkable that in tbe voyage he was now 
engaged in he hid the misfortune to be five times shipped and un- 
shipped, and never to /a^o to the place whither any of the ships he 
was in at first designed ; that his first intent was to have gone to 
Martinico, and that he went on Iward a ship bound thilher at Ht 
Malo ; but, being forced into Lisbon by bad weather, the ship re- 
ceived some damage by running aground in the mouth of the River 
Tagus, and wa« obliged to unload her cargo there ; but finding a Por- 
tuguese ship there bound to the Madeiras and ready to sail, and suppos- 
ing he should easily meet with a vessel there bound to Martinico, he 
went on board in order to sail to the Madeiras ; but the master of tlic 
Portuguese ship being but an indifferent mariner, had been out of his 
reckoning, and they drove to Fayal, where, however, he happened to 
find a very good market for his cargo, which was corn, and there- 
fore resolved not to go to the Madeiras, but to load salt at the Isle of 
May and to go away to NewfoundlaBd. lie had no remedy in this 
exigence but to go with the ship, and had a pretty good voyage as 
far as the Banks (so they call the place where they catch the fish), 
where meeting with a French ship bound from France to Quebec, in 
the river of Canada, and from thence to Martinico to carry provi- 
sions, he thought he should have an opportunity to complete his first 
design ; but when he came to Qutl^ec, the master of the ship died 
and the vessel proceeded no farther ; so the next voyage he shipped 
himself for France in the ship that was burne<l when we took them 
up at sea, and then shipped with us for the East Indies, as I liave 
already said. Thus he had been disappointed in five voyages, all, as - 
I may call it, in one voyage, besides what I shall have occasion to 
mention further of him. 

But I shall not make digression into other men*s stories which have 
no relation to my own : 1 return to what concerns our affairs in the 
island. He came to me one morning (for he lodged among us all the 
while we were upon the island), and it happened to be just when I 
was going to visit the Englishmen's colony, at the farthest part of the 
island ; I say, he came to me and told me, with a very grave coun- 
tenance, that he had for two or three days desired an opportunity of 
some discourse with me, which he hoped would not be displer.sinff 
to me, because he thought it might in some measure correspond 
with my general design, which was the prosperity of my new colony, 
and perhaps might put it, at least more than he yet thought it was, 
in the way of God's blessing. 

I looked a little surprised at the last part of his discourse, and turn- 
ing a little short, " How, sir," said I, *' can it be said that we are not 
in the way of God's blessing, after such visible assistances and deliv- 
erances as we have seen here, and of which I have given you a large 
account?" ** If you had pleased, sir," said he, with a .world of 
modesty, and yet great readiness, ** to have heard me, you would 



f 



ROBIXSOIT CRUSOE. 283 

have found no room to have been displeased, much less to think so 
Lard of me, that I should suggest that you have not had wonderful 
.issfstances and deliverances ; and I hope, on your behalf, that you 
are in the way of God's blessing, and your design is exceeding good, 
and will prosper : but, sir, though it were more so than is even possi- 
ble to you, yet there may be some among you that are not equally 
right in their actions : and you know that in the story of the children 
. of Israel, one Aclian in the camp removed God's blessiu|r from them, 
and turned his hand so against them that si x-and- thirty of them, 
though not concerned in the crime, were the obiects of divine ven- 
geauce and bore the weight of that punishment. 

I was sensibly touched with his discourse, and told him his inference 
was so ust and the whole design seemed so sincere and was really so 
religious in its own nature, that I was very sorry I had interrupted him, 
and begged him to go on ; and, in the mean time, because it seemed that 
vrhal we had both to say might take up some time, I told him I was 
going t(i the Englishmen's plantations and asked him to go with me, 
and we might discburse of it by the way. He told me he would the 
more willingly wait on me thither, because there partly the thing was 
acted which he desired to speak to me about ; so we walked on, and 
I pressed him to be free and plain with me in what he had to 
say. 

" Why, then, sir," says he, ** be pleased to give me leave to lay 
down a few propositions, as the foundation of what I have to say, 
that we may not differ in the general principles, though we may be 
of some difrering opinions in the practise of particulars. First, sir, 
though we differ in some of the doctrinal articles of religion (and it 
is very unhappv it is so, especially in the ca% before us, as I shall 
show afterwanl), yet there are some general principles in which we 
both agree — ^that there is a God ; and that tliis God, having given us 
some stated general rules for our service and ei>edience, we ought 
not willingly au^ knowingly to offend him, either by neglecting to 
do what he has commanded, or by doing what he has expressly for- 
bidden. And let our different religions be what they will, this gen- 
eral principle is readily owned by us all, that the blessing of God does 
not ordinarily follow presumptuous sinning against bis command ; 
and every good Christian will be affectionately concerned to prevent 
any that are under his care living in a total neglect of God and his 
commands. It is not your men being Protestants, whatever my 
opinion may be of such, that discharges me from being concerned 
for their souls and from endeavoring, if it lies before me, that they 
should live in as little distance from and enmity with their Maker as 
possible, especially if you give roc leave to meddle so far in your cir- 
cuit." 

I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told him I granted 
all he had said, and thanked him that he would so far concern himself 
for us ; and begged he would explain the particulars of what he had 



284 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

observed, that, like Joshua, to take his own parable, I might pat 
awaythe accursed Ihiug from us. 

"Why, then, sir," says he, ** I will take the liberty you give me : 
and there are three things, which, if I am right, must stand in the 
way of God's blessing upon your endeavors here, and which I should 
rejoice, for your sake and their own, to see removed. And. sir, I 
promise myself that you will fully agree with me in them all, as soon 
as I name them ; especially, because I shall convince you that every 
one of them may, wUh great ease and very much to your satisfaction, 
be remedied. First, sir, says he, " you have here four Englishmen, 
who have fetched women from among the savages and have taken 
them as their wives, and have had many children by them all, and 
yet are not married to them after any stated legal manner, as the 
laws of God and man require ; and therefore are yet, in the sense of 
both, no less than fornicators, if not living in adulteiy. To this, sir, 
I know you will object that there was no clergyman or priest of any 
kind, or any profession, to perform the ceremony ; nor any pen and 
ink, or paper, to write down a contract of marriage and have it 
signed between them. And I know also, sir, what the Spaniard gov- 
ernor has told you ; I mean of the agreement that he obliged them 
to make when they took those women, viz.. that they should choose 
them out by consent, and keep separately to them ; which, by the 
way, is nothing of a marriage, no agreement with the women, as 
wives, but onlv an agreement amont; themselves, to keep them from 
quarrelling. But, sir. the essence of the sacrament of matrimony (so 
he called it, being a Roman) consists not only in the mutual consent 
of the parties to take one another as man and wife, but in the formal 
and legal obligation that there is in the contract, to compel the man 
and woman, at all times, to own and acknowledge each other ; oblig- 
ing the man to abstain from all other women, to engage in no other 
contract while these subsist ; and, on all occasions, as ability allows, 
to provide honestly for them and their children ; and to oblige the 
women to the same or like conditions, mutatis mutandis, on their side. 
Now, sir,*' says he, '* these men may, when they please, or when oc- 
casion presents, abandon these women, disown their children, leave 
them to perish, and take other women and marry them while these 
are living ;" and here he added, with some warmth, *' How, sir, is 
(j^od honored in this unlawful liberty ? And how shall a blessing 
succeed your endeavors in this place, however good in themselves 
and however sincere in your design, while these men, who at present 
are your subjects, under your absolute government and dominion, 
are allowed by you to live in open adultery ?" 

I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but mucli more with 
the convincing arguments lie supported it with ; for it was certainly 
true, that though they had no clergyman upon the spot, yet a formal 
contract on both sides, made before witnesses and confirmed by any 
token which they had all agreed to be bound by, though it had been 



^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 285 

but breaking a stick between them, engaging the men to own' these 
women for their wives upon all occasions, and never to abandon them 
or their children, and the women to the same with their husbands', 
had been an effectual lawful marriage in the sight of God ; and it 
was a great neglect that it was not done. But I thought to have got 
off my young priest by telling him that all that part was done when 
I was not there ; and that they had lived so many years with them 
now, that if it was adultery, it was past remedy ; nothing could be 
done in it now. 

" Sir," says he, " asking your pardon for such freedom, you are 
right in this, that, it being done in your absence, you could not be 
char£?ed with that part of the crime ; but, I beseech you, flatter not 
yourself that you are not, tlierefore, under an obliscalion to do ypur 
utmost now to put an end to it. How can you think but that, let the 
time past lie on whom it will, all the guilt, for th'e future, will lie en- 
tirely upon you ? because it is certainly in your power now to put an 
end to it, and in nobody's power but yours." 

I was so dull still that I did not understand him right ; but I im- 
agined that, by putting an end to it. he meant that I should part 
them, and not suffer them to live together any longer ; and I said to 
him I could not do that by any means, for that would put the whole 
island into confusion. Efe seemed surprised that I should so far mis- 
take him. ** No, sir." says he, ** I do not mean that you should now 
separate them, but legally and effectually marry them ; and as, sir, 
my way of maiTying them may not be easy to reconcile them to, 
though it will be effectual, even by your own laws, so your way may 
-be as well before God, and as valid among men. I mean by a writ- 
ten contract, signed by both man and woman, and by all the wit- 
nesses present, which all the laws of Europe would decree to be 
valid." 

I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much sincerity of 
zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in his discourse as to his own 
party or church, and such true warmth for preserving the people 
that he had no knowledge of or relation to ; I say, for preserving 
them from transgressing the laws of God, the like of which I had, 
indeed, not met with anywhere. But recollecting what he had said 
of marrying them by a written contract, which 1 knew he would 
stand to, I returned it back upon him, and told him I granted all that 
he had said to be just, and on his part very kind ; that I would dis- 
course with the men upon the point now, when I came to them ; and 
I knew no reason why they should scruple to let. him marry them 
all, which I knew well enough would be granted to be as authentic 
and valid in England as if they were married by one of our own 
clergymen. What was afterward done in this matter I shall speak 
of by itself. 

I then pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint 
Which he had to make, acknowledging that I was very much his 



286 ROBINSON CRUSOK 

debtor for the first, and thanked him heartily for it. He told me he 
would use the same freedom and plainness in the second, and hoped I 
would take it as well ; and this was, that, notwithstanding these 
English subjects of miue, as he called Ihem, had lived with these 
women almost seven years, had taught them to speak English and 
even to read it, and that they were, as he perceived, women of toler- 
able understanding and capable of instruction^ yet they had not to t^ 
hour taught them anything of the Christian religion — no, not so 
much as to know that there was a God or a worship, or in what 
manner God was ^ be served, or that their own idolatry and wor- 
shipping they knew not whom was false and absurd. This, he said, 
was an unaccountable neglect, and what God would certainly call 
them to account for, and perhaps at last take the work out or their 
hands. He spoke this very affectionately and warmly. ** I am per- 
suaded,** says he, " had those men lived in the savage country whence 
their wives came, the savages would have taken more pains to have 
brought them to be idolaters and to worship the devil, than any of 
these men, so far as I can see, have taken with them to teach them 
the knowledge of the true God. Now. sir," said he, ** though I do 
not acknowledge your religion, or you mine, y6t we would be glad 
to see the devil's servants and the subjects of his kingdom taught to 
know the general principles of the Christian religion ; that they 
might, at least, hear of God and a Redeemer and of the resurrection, 
and of a future state — things which we all believe ; that they might, 
at least, be so much nearer coming into the bosom of the true church 
than they are now, in the public profession of idolatry and devil- 
worship.'* 

I could hold no longer : I took him in my arms and embraced 
him with an excess of passion. *' How far," said I to him, *' have 
I been from understanding the most essential part of a Christian, viz., 
to Igve the interest of the Chiistian church and the good of other 
men's souls ! I scarce have known what belongs to the being a 
Christian." *' Oh, sir ! do not say so," replied he ; ** this thing is not 
your fault." " No," said I ; " but why did I never lay it to heart 
as well as you?" " It is not too late yel,'* said he ; ** be not too 
forward to condemn yourself.*' '* But what can be done now?" 
said It" you see I am going away.*' " Will you give me leave to 
talk with these poor men about it ?" " Yes, with all my heart," said 
I ; *' and will oblige them to give heed to what you say, too." " As 
to that," said he, ** we must leave them to the mercy of Chiist ; but 
it is your business to assist them, encourage them, and instruct them; 
and if you give me leave and God his blessing, I do not doubt but 
tlie poor ignorant souls shall be broiight home to the great circle of 
Christianity, if not into the particular faith we all embrace, and that 
even while you stay here.** Upon this I said, '* I shall not only give 
you leave, but .rive you a thousand thanks for it.'* What foflowed 
I shall mention in its place. 



ROBIKSOK CRUSOE. 287 

T now pressed liim for the third article in which we were to blame. 
"Why, really," says he, "it is of the same nature. And I will 
proceed, asking your leave with tbe same plainness as before. It is 
about your poor savages, who are, as I may say, your conquered 
subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that is or ought to be received among 
all Christians of what church or pretended church soever, that the 
Christian knowledge ought to be propagated by all possible means 
and on all possible occasions. It is on this principle that our church 
sends missionaries into Persia, India, and China ; and that our 
clergy, even of the superior sort, willingly engage in the most has^ 
ardous voyages, and the most dangerous residence among murderers 
and barbarians, to teach them the knowledge of the true Qod, and to 
bring them over to embrace the Christian faith. Now, sir, you have 
such an opportunity here to have six or seven and thirty poor savages 
brought over from a state of idolatry to tbe knowledge of (Jod, their 
Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pass such an occa- 
aon of doing good, which is really worth the expense of a man's 
whole life. " ' 

I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one word to say. I 
had here the spirit of true Christian zeal for God and religion before 
me, let his particular principles be of what kind soever. As for me, 
I had not so much as entertamed a thought of this in my heart before, 
and I believe I should not have thought of it ; for I looked upon these 
savages as slaves and people whom, had we had any work for them 
to do, we would have used as such, or would have l)een glad to have 
transported them to any other part of the world ; for our business 
was to get rid of them, and we would all have been satisfied if they 
had been sent to any country, so they had never seen their own. 1 
was confounded at his discourse, and knew not what answer to make 
him. 

He looked earnestly at me, seeing me in some disorder. ** Sir," 
says he, ** I shall be very sorry if what I have said gives you any 
offence.** " No, no," said I, ** I am offended with nobody but my- 
self ; but I am perfectly confounded, not only to think that I should 
never take any notice of this before, but with reflecting what notice 
I am able to take of it now. You know, sir," said I, *' what cir- 
cumstances I am in ; I am bound to the East Indies in a ship 
freighted by merchants, and to whom it would be an insufferable 
piece of injustice to detain their ship here, the men lying all this 
while at victuals and wages on the owners* account. It is true, I 
agreed to be allowed twelve days here, and if I stay more I must pay 
three pounds sterling per diem demurrage ; nor can I stay upon de- 
murrage above eight days more, and I have been here thirteen already ; 
so that I am perfectly unable to engage in this work, unless I would 
suffer myself to be left behind here again ; in which case, if this sin- 
gle ship should miscarry in any part of her voyage, I should be just 
m the same condition that I was left in here at first, and from which 



288 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

I have been so wonderfully delivered. " He owned the case was very 
hard upon me as to my voyage ; but laid it home upon my conscience, 
whether the blessing of saving thirty-seven souls was not worth ven- 
turing all I had in the world n>r. I was not so sensible of that as he 
was. I replied to him thus : '* Why, sir, it is a valuable thing, in- 
deed, to be an instrument in God's hand to convert thirty -seven 
heathens to the knowledge of Christ ; but as you Are an ecclesiastic, 
and are given over to the work, so it seems so naturally to fall into 
the way of your profession ; how is it, then, that you do not rather 
offer yourself to undertake it than press me to do it ?** 

Upon this he faced about just before me, as he walked along, and 
putting me to a full stop made me a very low bow. ** I most heartilv 
thank God and you, sir," said he, ** for giving me so evident a call 
to so blessed a work ; and if you think yourself discharged from it 
and desire me to undertake it, I will most readily do it, and think it 
a happy reward for all the hazards and difficulties of such a broken, 
disappointed voyage as I have met with, that I am dropped at last 
into so glorious a work.** 

I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke this to 
me ; his eyes sparkled like fire, his face glowed, and his color came 
and went as if he had been falling into fits ; in a word, he was fired 
with the joy of being embarked in such a work. I paused a consid- 
erable while before 1 could tell what to say to him ; for I was really 
surprised to find a man of such sincerity and zeal and carried ]but in 
his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men, not of his profession only, 
but even of any profession whatsoever. But after I had considered 
it a while, I asked him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he 
would venture, on the single consideration of an attempt to convert 
those poor people, to be locked up in an unplanted island for perhaps 
his life, and at last might not know whether he should be able to do 
them good or not. 

He turned short upon me and asked me what I called a venture ? 
*' Pray, sir,'* said he, ** what do you think I consenle<l to eo in your 
ship to the East Indies for?" *' Nay," said I, " that 1 know not. 
unless it was to preach to the Indians." " Doubtless it was," said 
he ; •* and do you think, if I can convert these tliirly-^ven men to ' 
the faith of Jesus Christ, it is not worth my time, though I should 
never be fetched off the island again ?— nay, is it not infinitely of more 
worth to save so many souls than my life is, or the life of twenty 
more of the same profession? Yes, sir,** says he, ** I would give 
Christ and the blessed Virgin thanks all my days, if I could be made 
the happy instrument of saving the souls of those poor men, though 
I were never to get my foot off this island, or see my native country 
any more. But since you will honor me with putting me into this 
work, for which I will pray for you all the days of my life, I have 
one humble petition to you besides." '* What- is that?" said I. 
•* Why," says he, " it is that you will leave your man Friday with 






Jli 



ROBIKSOK CRUSOE. 289 

me, to be my InteFpreter to them, and to assist me ; for witfiout some 
help I cannot speak to them, or they to me.'* 

1 was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because I couid 
not think of parting with him, and that for many reasons : he had 
been the companion of my travels ; he was not only faithful to me, 
but sincerely affectionate to the last degree ; and I had resolved to do 
something considerable for him if he outlived me, as it was probable 
he would. Then I knew that, as I had bred Friday up to be a Prot- 
estant, it would quite confound him to bring him to embrace another 
religion ; and he would never, while his eyes were open, believe that 
lus old master was a heretic and would be damned ; and this might in 
the end ruin the poor fellow's principles, and so turn him back again 
to his first idolatry. However, a sudden thought relieved me in this 
strait, and it was this : I told him I could not say that I was willing to 
part with Friday on any account whatever, though a work that to 
niiu was of more value than his life ought to be to me of much more 
value than the keeping or parting with a servant. But, on the other 
hand, I was persuaded that Friday would b^ no means agree to part 
with me ; and I could not force him to it without his consent, with- 
out manifest injustice ,* bf^auso I had promised I would never send 
him away, and he had promised and engaged to me that he would 
never leave me, unless 1 sent him away. 

He seemed very much c(Hicerned at it, for he had no rational ac- 
cess to these poor people, seeing he did not understand one word of 
their language, nor they one of his. To remove this difficulty, I told 
him Friday's father had learned Spanish, which I found he also un- 
derstood, and he should serve him as an interpreter. So he was much 
better satisfied, and noth'ng could persuade him but he would stay 
and endeavor to convert them ; but Providence gave another very 
happy turn to all this. 

I come back now to the first part of his objections. When we 
came to the Englishmen, J sent for them all together, and after some 
account given them of what I had done for them, viz., what neces- 
sary things I had provided for them and how they were distributed, 
which they were very sensible of and very thankful for, I began to 
talk to them of the scandalous life they led, and gave them a full ac- 
count of the notice the clergymui bad taken of it ; and arguing how 
michristian and irreligious a life it was, I first asked them if they 
were married men or bachelors ? They soon explained their condi- 
tion to me, and showed that two of them were witfowers and ttie other 
three were single men, or bachelors. I asked them with what con- 
science they could take these women and call them their wives, and 
have so many children by them, and not be lawfully married to 
them? 

They all gave me the answer I expected, viz., that there was nobody 
to marry them ; that they agreed before the governor to keep them 
as their wives, and to maintain them and own them as their wives ; 
R. c. -10 



290 ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 

and they thought, as things stood with them, they were as legally 
married as if tney had been married by a parson and with all the 
formalities in the world. 

I told them that no doubt they were married in the sight of God, 
and were bound in conscience to keep them as their wiyes ; but that 
the laws of men being otherwise, they might desert the poor women 
and children hereafter ; and that their wives, being poor desolate 
women, friendless and moneyless, would have no way to help them< 
selves. I therefore told them that, unless I was assured of their hon- ^ 

est intent, I could do nothing for them, but would take care that i 

what I did should be for the women and children without them ; and 
that unless they would give me some assurances that they would 
marry the women, 1 could not think it was convenient they should 
continue together as man and wife ; for that it was both scandalous 
to men and offensive to God, who they could not think would bless 
them if they went on thus. 

All this went on as I expected ; and they told me, especially Will 
Atkins, who now seemed to speak for the rest, that they loved their 
wives as well as if they had been born in their own native country, 
and would not leave them on any account whatever ; and they did 
verily believe that their wives were as virtuous and as modest, and 
did, to the utmost of their skill, as much for them and for their chil- 
dren as any women could possibly do ; and they would not part with 
them on any account ; and Will Atkins, for his own particular, added 
that if any man would take him away and offer to cany him home to 
England and make him captain of the best man of-war in the navy, 
he would not go with him, if he might not carry his wife and chil- 
dren with him ; and if there was a clergyman in the ship he would 
be married to her now wilh all his heart. 

This is just as I would have it The priest was not with me at 
that moment, but was not far off ; so to try him farther, I told him 
I had a clergyman with me, and if he was sincere. I would have him 
married next morning, and bade him consider of it and talk with the 
rest. He said, as for himself, he need not consider of it at all, for he 
was very ready to do it and was glad I had a minister with me, and 
he believed they would be all willing also. I then told him that my 
friend, the minister, was a Frenchman and could not speak English, 
but I would act the clerk between them. He never so much as asked 
me whether he was a Papist or Protestant, which was, indeed, what I 
was afraid of ; so we parted : I went back to my clergyman, and Will 
Atkins went in to talk with his companions. I desired the French 
gentleman not to say anything to them till the business was thor- 
oughly ripe ; and I told him what answer the men had given me. 

Before I went from their quarter, they all came to me, and told me 
they had been considering what I had said ; that they were glad to 
hear I had a clergyman in my company, and they were very willing 
to give me the satisfaction I desired, and to be formally married as 



_J|J 



ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 291 

Boon as I pleased ; for they -were far from desiring to part with their 
wives, and that they meant nothing but what was very honest when 
they chose them. So I appointed them to meet me the next morn- 
ing ; and in the mean time they should let their wives know the 
menning of the marriage law ; and that it was not only to prevent 
any scandal, but al^ to oblige them that they should not forsake 
them, whatever might happen. 

The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the thing, 
and were very well satisfied with it, as, indeed, they had reason to 
be : so they failed not to attend all together at my apartment next 
mornings where I brought out my clergyman ; and though he had 
not on a minister's gown, after the manner of England, or the habit 
of a priest, after the manner of Prance, yet having a black vest some- 
thing like a cassock, with a sash round it, he did not look very un- 
like a minister ; and as for his language, I was his interpreter. But 
the seriousness of his behavior to them and the scruples he made of 
marrying the women, because they were not baptized and professed 
Christians, gave them an exceeding reverence for his person ; and 
there was no need after that to inquire whether he was a clergyman 
or not. Indeed, I was afraid his scruples would have been carried so 
far as that he would not have married them at all ; nay, notwith- 
standing all I was able to say to him, he resisted me, though mod- 
estly, yet very steadily, and at last refused absolutely to marry them, 
unless he had first talked with the men and the women too ; and 
though at first I was a little backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it 
with a good will, perceiving the sincerity of his design. 

When he came to them he let them know that I had acquainted him 
with their circumstances and with the present design ; that he was 
very willing to perform that part of his function and marry them, as 
I had desired ; but that before he could do it he must take the lib- 
erty to talk with them. He told them, that in the sight of all iu' 
different men and in the sense of the laws of society they had lived 
all this while in open fornication ; and that it was true that nothing 
but the consenting to marry, or effectually separating them from one 
another, could now put an end to it ; but there was a difllculty in it 
too, with respect to the laws of Christian matrimony, which he was 
not fully satisfied about — that of marrying one that is a professed 
Christian to a savage, an idolater, and a heathen, one that is not bap-* 
tized ; and yet that he did not see that there was time left to endeav- 
or to persuade the women to be baptized, or to profess the name of 
Ciirist, whom they had, he doubted, heard nothing of, and without 
which they (^ould not be baptized. Ho told them he doubted they 
were but indifferent Cbristiaus themselves ; that they had but little 
knowledge of God or of his ways, and therefore he could not expect 
that they had said much to their wives on that head yet ; but that, 
unless they would promise him to use their endeavors with their 
wives to persuade them to become Christians, and would as weU as 



292 EOBINSON CRUSOE. 

they could instruct them iu the knowledge and belief of God that 
made them, and to worship Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could 
not marry them ; for he would have no hand in joining Christians 
with savages, nor was it consiciicut with the principles of the Chris- 
tian religion, and was, indeed, expressly forbidden in G^'s law. 

Th y heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it very faith- 
fully to them from his mouth, as near his own woids as I could ; 
only sometimes adding something of my own, to convince them how 
just it was and that I was of his mind ; and 1 always very faithfully 
distinguished between what I said from myself, and what were the 
clergyman's words. They told me it was very true what the gentle- 
man said, that they were very indifferent Christians themselves, and 
that they had never talked to their wives about religion. *' Lord, 
sir," says Will Atkms, ** how should we teach them religion ? Why, 
we know nothing ourselves ; and besides, sir," said he, ** should we 
talk to them of God and Jesus Chiist and heaven and hell, it would 
make them laugh at us, and askus what we believe ourselves? And if 
we should tell them that we believe all the things we speak of to them, 
such as of good people going to heaven and wicked people to the 
devil, they would ask us where we intend to go ourselves, that be- 
lieve all this and are such wicked fellows as we indeed are ? Why, 
sir, 'tis enough to give them a surfeit of religion at first hearing ; folkfl 
must have some religion themselves before they pretend to teach 
other people." '* Will Atkins," said I to him, *' though I am afraid 
that what you say has too much truth in it, yet can you not tell your 
wife she is in the wrong ; that there is a God and a religion better 
than her own ; that her gods are idols ; that they can neither hear 
nor speak ; that there is a great Being that made all things and that 
run destroy all that he has made ; that he rewards the good and pun- 
ishes the bad ; and that we are to be judged by him at last for all we 
do here ? You are not so ignorant but even nature itself will teach you 
that all this is true ; and I am satisfied you know it all to be true, and 
believe it yourself." " That is true, sir," said Atkins ; ** but with 
what face can I say anything to my wife of all this, when she will 
tell me immediately it cannot be true?" **Not true 1" said I; 
" what do you mean by that ?" ** Why. sir," said he, ** she will tell 
me it cannot be true that this God I shall tell her of can be just, or 
can punish or reward, since I am not punished and sent to the devil 
that have been such a wicked creature, as she knows I have been even 
to her and to everybody else ; and that I should be suffered to live, 
that have been always acting so contrary to witat 1 must tell her Is 
good, and to what I ought to have done. '* Why, trulj% Atkins," 
said 1^ ** I am afraid thou speakest too much truth ;" and with that 
I informed the ch^rgyman of what Atkins had said, for he was im[)a- 
tienttoknow. " Oh, ' said the pi lest, *' tell him there is one thing will 
make him the best minister in the world to his wife, and that is, re- 
pentance ; for none teach repentance like true penitents. He wants 



ROBIKSON CRUSOE. 293 

nothing but to repent, and then he will be so much the better quali- 
fied to instruct hb wife ; he will then be able to tell her that there is 
not only a God, aud that he is the just Rewarder of good and evil, 
but that he is a merciful Being, and with infinite goodness and long- 
suffering forbears to punish those that offend ; waiting to be gracious, 
and willing not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should re- 
turn and live ; that oftentimes hu suffers wicked men to go a long 
time, and even reserves damnation to the general day of retribution ; 
that it is a clear evidence of God and of a future state that righteous 
men receive not their reward, or wicked men their punishment, till 
they come into another world ; and this will lead him to teach his 
wife the doctrine of the resurrection and of the last judgment. Let 
him but repent himself, he will be an excellent preacher of repent- 
ance to his wife." 

I repealed all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the while, 
and who, we could easily perceive, was more than ordinarily affected 
with it ; when being eager and hardly suffering me to make an 
end — " I know all this, master,'* says he, ** and a great deal more ; 
but I have not the impudence to talk thus^ to my wife, when God 
and my conscience know and my wife will be an undeniable evi- 
dence against me, that I have lived as if I had never heard of a God 
or future state, or anything about it ; and to talk of my repenting, 
alas !*' — and with that he fetched a deep sigh, and I could see that the 
tears stood in his eyes—" 'tis past all that with me." ** Past it, At- 
kins?" said I: ** what dost thou mean by tliat?" ** I know well 
enough what I mean, " says he ; ''I mean 'tis too late, and that is too 
true." 

I told the clergyman word for word what be said : the poor, zeal- 
ous priest — I must call him so, for, be his opinion what it will, he 
had certainly a most singular affection for the good of other men's 
souls, and it would be hard to think he had not the like for his own — 
I say this affectionate man could not refrain from tears ; but recover- 
ing himself said to me, " Ask him but one question : Is he easy that 
it is too late ; or is he troubled and wishes it were not so ?" I put 
the question Jairly to Atkins ; and he answered, with a great deal of 
passion, '' How could any man be easy in a condition that must cer- 
tainly end in eternal destruction ? that he was far from being easy ; 
but' that on the contrary he believed it wuuld one time or other ruin 
him." " What do you mean by that?" said I. " Why," he said. 
** he believed he should one time or other cut his throat to put an end 
tothe terror of it." 

The clergyman shook his head with great concern in his face when 
I UAd him all this ; but turning quick to me upon it says, '* If that be 
his case, we may assure him it is not too lale ; Christ will give him 
repentance. Bnt pray," says he, " explain this to him ; that as no 
man is saved but by Christ, and the merit of his passion procuring 
divine mercy for him, how can it be too late for any man to receive 



294 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

mercy ? Does he think he is able to sio beyond the power or reach 
of divine mercy ? Pray lell him, there may be a time when provoked 
mercy will no longer strive, and when God may refuse to hear, but 
that it is never too late for men to ask mercy ; and we, that are 
Christ's servants, are commanded to preach mercy at all times, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely repent : so that it is 
never too late to repent." 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earnestness ; but 
it seemed as if he turned off the discourse to the rest, for he said to 
me, he would go and have some talk with his wife ; so he went out 
awhile, and we talked to the rest. I perceived they were all stupidly 
ignorant as to matters of religion, as much as I was when I went 
rambling away from my father ; and yet there were none of f hem 
backward to hear what had been said : and all of them seriously prom- 
ised that they would talk with their wives about it and do their 
endeavors to persuade them to turn Christians. 

The clergyman smiled upon me when 1 reported what answer they 
gave, but said nothing a good while ; but ai last, shaking his heacf, 
** We that are Christ's servants," says he, " can go no farther than 
to exhort and instruct ; and when men comply, submit to the reproof 
and promise what we ask, 'tis all we can do ; we are bound to accept 
their good words ; but believe me, sir," said he, *' whatever you may 
have known of the life of that man you call Will Aikins, I believe he 
is the only sincere convert among them : I will not despair of the 
rest ; but* that man is apparently struck wilh the sense of his past 
life, and 1 doubt not, when he comes to talk of religion to his wife, 
he will talk himself effectually into it ; for attempting to teach others 
is sometimes the best way of teaching ourselves. 1 know a man who, 
having nothing but a summary notion of religion himself, and being 
wicked and profligate to the last degree in his life, made a thorough 
reformation in himself by laboring to convert a Jew. If that poor 
Atkins begins but once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ to his wife, 
my life for it he talks himself into a thorough convert, makes himself 
a penitent, and who knows what may follow 1" 

Upon this discourse, however, and their promising, as above, to en- 
deavor to persuade their wives to embrace Christianity, he married 
the other two couple : but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet 
come in. After this, my clergyman, waiting awhile, was curious to 
know where Atkins was gone ; and turning to me, said, ** I entreat 
you, sir, let us w.ilk out of your labyrinth here ^nd look ; I dare say 
we shall find this poor man somewhere or other talkiLg seriously to 
his wife and teaching her already something of religion." I be^n to 
bo of the same mind ; so we went out together, and 1 carried him a 
way which none knew but myself, and where the trees were so very 
thick that it was not easy to see through the thicket of leaves, and so 
far harder to see in than to see oui ; when, coming to the edge of tho 
wood, I saw Atkins and his tawny wife sitting under the £hade of a 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 295 

bush, very eager in discourse : I stopped short till mv clergyman 
came up to me, and then, having showed him where they were, wo 
stood and looked very steadily at them a good while. We observed 
him very earnest with her, pointing up to the sun and to every quar- 
ter of the heavens, and then down to the earth, then out to the sea, 
then to himself, then to her, to the woods, to the trees. ''Now,'* 
says the clergyman, ** you see my words are made good ; the mun 
preaches to her : mark him now ; he is telling her that our God has 
made him and her and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the woods, 
the trees, etc.*' *' I believe he is," said I. Immediately we perceived 
Will Atkins start upon his feet, fall down on his knees and lift up both 
his hands. We supposed he said something, but we could not hear 
him ; it was too far for that. He did not continue kneeling half a 
minute, but comes and sits down again by his wife and talks to her 
again ; we perceived then the woman very attentive, but whether 
she said anything to him we could not tell. While the poor fellow was 
upon his knees, I could see the tears run plentifully down my clergy- 
man 's'cheeks, and I could hardly forbear myself ; but it was a great 
affliction to us both that we were not near enough to hear anything 
that passed between them. Well, however, we could come no 
nearer for fear of disturbing them : so we resolved to see an end of 
this piece of still conversation, and it spoke loud enough to us with- 
out the help of voice. He sat down again, as I have said, close by 
her, and talked again eameatly to her, and two or three times we could 
eee him embrace her most passionately ; another time we saw him 
take out his handkerchief and wipe her eyes and then kiss her again 
wi\h a kind of transport very unusual ; and after several of thfese 
things, we saw him on a sudden jump up again and lend her his 
hand to help her up, when, immediately leading her by the hand a 
step or two, they both kneeled down together and continued so 
about two minutes. 

My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud, " St. Paul I 
St. Faul ! behold, he prayeth.'* I was afraid Atkins would hear him ; 
therefore I entreated him to withhold himself awhile, that we might 
see an end of the scene, which to me, I must confess, was the most 
affecting that ever I saw in my life. Well, he stiove with himself for 
awhile, but was in such raptures, to think that the poor heathen 
woman was become a Christian, that he was not able to contain him- 
self ; he wept several times, then throwing up his hands and cross- 
ing his breast, said over several things ejaculatory, and by the way 
of giving God thanks for so miraculous a testimony of the success of 
our endeavors ; some he spoke softly, and I could not well hear 
others ; some in Latin, some in French ; then two or three times the 
tears would interrupt him, that he could not speak at all ; but I 
begged that he would contain himself and let us more narrowly and 
fully observe what was before us, which he did for a time, the scene 
not being near ended yet ; for after the poor man and his wife were 



296 BOBINSON CRUSOE. 

risen a^n from their knees, we observed he stood talking still 
eagerly to her, and we observed her motion, that she was greatly 
affected with what he said, by her frequently lifting up her hands, 
laying her hand to her breast, and such other postures as express the 
greatest seriousness and attention ; this continued about half a quar- 
ter of an hour, and then they walked away, su we could see no more 
of them in that situation. 1 took this interval to say to the clergy- 
man, first, that I was glad to see the particulars we had botli been 
witnesses to ; that, though I was hard enough of belief in such cases, 
yet that I began to thmk it was all very sincere here, both in the 
man and his wife, however ignoraut they might both be, and I hoped 
such a beginning would yet have a more happy end. ** And who 
knows,'* said I, but these two may in time, by instruction and ex- 
ample, work upon some of the others?" ** Some of them?*' said 
he, turning quick upon me ; ** ay, upon all of them : depend upon it, 
if those two savages — for he has been but little bttler, as you relate 
it — should embrace Jesus Christ, Uiey will never leave it till they 
work upon all the rest ; for true religion is naturally communicative, 
and he that is once made a Christian will never leave a pagan be- 
hind him, if he can help it." I owned it was a most Christian prin- 
ciple to think so, and a testimony of true zeal as well as a generous 
heart in him. *' But, my friend, said I, *' will you give me leave to 
start one difficulty here ? I cannot tell how to object the least thinfi[ 
against that affectionate concern which you show for the turning or 
the poor people from their paganism to the Christian religion ; bnt 
how does this comfort you, wliile these people are, in your account, 
out of the pale of the Catholic Church, without which you believe 
there is no salvation ? so that you esteem these but heretics, as effect- 
ually lost as the pagans themselves?" 

To this he answered, with abundance of candor, thus : ** Sir, I am 
a Catholic of the Roman Church, and a priest of the order of St. 
Benedict, and I embrace all the principles of the Homan faith ; but 
yet, if you will believe me, and that I do not speak in compliment to 
you, or in respect to my circumstances and your civilities ; I say 
nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who call yourselves reformea, 
without some charity ; I dare not say (though I know it is our opin- 
ion in general) that you cannot be saved ; i will by no means limit 
the mercy of Christ so far as to think that he cannot receive you into 
the bosom of his church, in a manner to us unperceivable ; and I 
hope you have the same charity for us : I pray daily foi^your being 
all restored to Christ's church, by whatsoever method he, who is ail- 
wise, is pleased to direct. In the mean time surely you will allow it 
consists with me, as a Roman, to distinguish far between a Protestant 
and a pagan ; between one Uiat calls on Jesus ('hrist, though in a 
way which 1 do not think is according to the true faith, and a sava^ 
or a bai'barian, that knows no God, no Christ, no Redeemer ; and if 
you are not within the pale of the Catholic Church, we hope you are 



BOBINSON CRUSOB. 297 

nearer being restored to it tlian those wlio know nothing tf €k>d or of 
his church : and I rejoice, therefore, when I see this poor man, who, 
you say, has been a profligate and almost a murderer, kneel down 
and pray to Jesus Christ, as we suppose be did, though not fully 
enlightened ; believing that God, from whom every such work pro- 
ceeds, will sensibly touch his heart and brin^ bun to the further 
knowledge of that truth in his own time ; and if God shall influence 
this poor man to concert and instruct the ignorant savage, his wife, 
I can never believe that he shall be cast away himself. And have I 
not reason, then, to rejoice, the nearer any are brought to the knowU 
edge of Christ, though they may not be brought quite home into the 
bosom of the Catholic church just at the time when I mav desire it, 
leaving it to the goodness of Christ to perfect his work in his own 
time,. and in bis own way? Certainly, I would rejoice if all the 
savages in America were brought, like this poor woman, to pray to 
God, though they were all to be Protestants at first, rather than they 
should continue pagans or heathens ; firmly believing that He that 
had bestowed the first light on them would further illuminate them 
with a beam of his heavenly grace, and bring them into the pale of 
his church, when he should see good. '* 

I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this pious Papist, 
as much as I was oppressed by the power of his reasoning ; and it 
presently occurred to my' thoughts, that if such a temper was uni- 
versal, we might be all Catholic Christians, whatever church or 
particular profession we ioined in ; that a spirit of charity would 
soon work us all up into right principles ; and as he thousfht that the 
like charity would make us all Catholics, so I told him I believed 
had all the members of his church the like moderation 'tliey would 
soon all be Protestants. And there we left that part ; for we never 
disputed at all. 

However, I talked to him another way, and taking him by the 
hand, '* My friend,** says I, *' I wish all the clergy of the Romish 
X/hurch were blessed with such moderation, and had an equal share 
of your chanty. I am entirely of your opinion ; but I must tell- 
you, that if you should preach such doctrine in Spain or Italy they 
would put you into the Inquisition.'* ** It may be so," said he ; '* I 
know not what they would do in Spain or Italy ; but I will not say 
they would be the better Christians for that severity ; for I am sure 
there is no heresy in abounding with charity." 

Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our business there 
was over ; so we went back our own way ; and when we came back 
we found them waiting to be called in : observing this, I asked my 
clergyman if we should discover to him that we had seen him under 
the bush or not ; and it was his opinion we should not, but that we 
should talk to him first, and hear what he would say to us : so we 
called him in alone, nobody being in the pUuM but ourselvta, and I 
b^an with him thus : 



I 



298 ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 

** Will Atfins," said I, " pry thee what education had you ? What . 
wad your father ?' ' 

TV. ^.~A better man than ever I shall be ; sir, my father was a 
clergyman. 

B. (7. —What education did he give you ? 

W. -4.— He would have taught me well, sir, but I despised all edu- 
cation, iustruction, or correction, like a beast as 1 was. 

B. C. — It is true, Solomon says, *' He that despises reproof is 
brutish.** 

W. A. — Ay, sir, I was brutish indeed, for I murdered my father : 
for God's sake, sir, talk no more about t^at ; sir, I murdered my 
poor father. 

Ji. C. — Ha ! a murderer ! 

Here the priest started (for I interpreted every word he spoke) and 
looked pale : it seems he believed that Will had really killed his 
father. 

B. C. — No, no, sir ; I do not understand him so : Will Atkins, ex- 
plain yourself : you did not kill your father, did you, with your own 
hands ? 

W. A. — No, sir, I did not cut his throat ; but I cut the thread of 
all his comforts, find shortened his days ; I broke his heart by the 
most ungrateful, unnatural return, for the most tender and affection- 
ate treatment that ever father gave or child could receive. 

B. G. — Well, 1 did not ask you about your father to extort this 
confession : I pray God give you repentance for it, and forgive that 
and all your other sins ; but 1 asked you because I see that though 
you have not much learning, yet you are not so ignorant as some are 
m things that are good ; that you have known more of religion, a 
gieat deal, than you have practised. 

W. A. — Though you, sir, do not extort the confession that I make 
about my father, conscience does ; and whenever we come to look 
back upon our lives, the sins against our indulgent parents are cer- 
tainly the first to touch us ; the wounds they make lie deepest, and 
the weight they leave will lie heaviest upon the mind, of all the sins 
we can commit. 

B. C. — You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins ; I can- 
not bear it. 1 

W. A. — You bear it, master ! I dare say you know nothing of it. I 

B. C. — Yes, Atkins, every shore, every hill, nay, 1 may say every } 

tree in this island, is witness to the anguish of my soul fur my in- 
gratitude to, and bad usage of, a good, tender. father, a falhcr much 
like yours, by your description : and I murdered my father as well 
as you, Will Atkins ; but 1 think, for all that, my repentance is short 
of yours, too, by a great deal. 

I would have said more if I could have restrained my passions ; 
but I thought this poor man's repentance was so much sincerer than 
mine that I was going to leave off the discourse and retire ; for I 



.•■ ^ 



BOBINSOK CRUSOE. - 299 

was surprised with what he had said, and thought that instead of my 
goin^ about to teach and instruct him, the man was made a teacher 
and instructor to me- in a most surprising and unexpected manner. 

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly affected 
with it, and said to me, '* Did I not say, sir, that when this man was 
converted he would preach to us all ¥ I tell you, sir, if this one man 
be made a true penitent, here will be no need of me ; he will make 
Christians of all in the island. ** But having a little composed myoelf, 
I renewed my discourse with Will Atkins. "But, Will/' said I, 
** how comes the sense of this matter to touch you just now ?*' 

W. A. — Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck a dart 
through my very soul : I have been talking about God and religion 
to my wife, in order, as you directed me, to make a Christiau of her, 
and she has preached such a sermon to me as I shall never forget 
while I live. 

B. C. — No, no ; it is not your wife has preached to you ; but when 
you were moving religious arguments to her, conscience has flung 
them back upon you. 

W. A. — Ay, sir, with such force as is not. to be resisted. 

E, C. — Pray, Will, let us know what passed between you and your 
wife ; for I know something of it already. 

W. A. — Sir, it is impossible to give you a full account of it ; I 
am too full to hold it, and vet have no tongue to express it ; but let 
her have said what she will, though I cannot give you an account of 
it, this I can tell you, that I have resolved to amend and reform my 
life. 

B. C.—But tell us some of it : how did you begin, Will ? For this 
has been an extraordinary case, that is certain. She has preached a 
sermon indeed, if she has wrought this upon you. 

W. A. — Why, I first told her^the nature of our laws about mar- 
riage, and what the reasons were that men and women were obliged 
to enter into such compacts, as it was neither in the power of one 
nor other to break ; that otherwise order and justice could not be 
maintained, and men would run from their wives and abandon their 
children, mix confusedly with one another, and neither families be 
kept entire nor inheritances be settled by legal descent. 

B, C. — You talk like a civilian. Will. Could you make her under- 
stand what you meant by inheritance and families ? They know no 
such things among the savages, but marry anyhow, without regard 
to relation, conscfnguinity, or family ; brother and sister, nay, as I 
have been told, even the father and the daughter, and the son and 
the mother. 

W. A. — I believe, sir, you are misinformed, and my wife assures 
me of the contrary, and that they abhor it ; perhaps, for any further 
relations, they may not be so exact as we are ; but she tells me never 
in the near relationship you speak of. 

B. C7.— Weil, li^hai dia she say to what you told her ? 



300 BOBINBON CRUSOE. 

W. A. — She said dfae liked it vviy well, as it was tnueh better tiMB 
in her countiy. 

B. (7.— But did yoa tell her what marriage was ¥ 

W, A, — Aj, ay, there hegan our dialogue. I asked her if she 
would foe married to me our way. She asked me what way that 
was. I told her marriage was appointed by God ; and here we had 
a strange talk together, indeed, as ever man and wife had, I believe. 

N.B. This dialogue between Will Atkins and his wife I took 
down in writing, just after he had told it me, which was as follows : 

Wife. — Appomted by your God I Why, have you a Qod in your 
countrj'? 

W. J..— Yes, my dear, God is in every country. 

y^e. — No your God in my country ; my country have the great 
old Benamuckee God. 

W, A. — Child, I am very unfit to show you who God is ; God is 
in heaven, and made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and all that 
in them is. 

Wife, — No makee de earth ; no you God makee all earth ; no 
makee my country'. 

- Wilt Atkins laughed a little at her expression of God not making 
her country. 

Wife.^rio laugh ; why laugli me ? This nothing to laugh. 

He was justly reproved by his wife, for she was more serious than 
he at ^rst. 

W. A. — ^That's true, indeed ; 1 will not laugh any more, my dear. 

Wife. — Why you say you God makee all ? 

W, ^.— ^Yes, child, our God made the whole world, and you, and 
me, and all things ; for he is the only true God, and there is no God 
but him ; he lives forever in heaven. 

Wife. — ^Why vou no tell me k)ng«ago? 

W, A. — That s true indeed ; but I have been a wicked wretch, 
and have not only forgotten to acqutunt tliee with anything before, 
but have lived without God in the world myself. 

Wtfe. — What, have you a great God m your country, you no know 
him ? No say O to him ? No do good thing for him ? That no 
possible. 1 

W. A.-^lt is true ; though, for all that, we live as if there was no | 

God in heaven, or that he had no power on earth. ; 

Wife. — But why Qod let you do so ? Why he no makee you good 
live ? ; 

W. A. — It is all our own fault. 

Wife. — But you say me he, is great, much great, have much great 
power, can makee kill when he will ; why he no makee kill when 
you no serve him ? No say O to him ? No be good mans ? 

W. A. — That is tnie ; he might strike me dead ; and I ought to 
expect it, for I have been a wicked wretch, that is true ; but God is j 

merciful, and does not deal with uo as wo deservo. 



ftOBtNSOK CRUSOE. 301 

ft 

Wife. — But then you do not tell God thankee for that too ? 

W. A. —No, indeed, I have not thanked God for his mercy, any 
more than I haive feared God for his power. 

Wife. — Then you God no Gk>d ; me no think believe he be such 
one, great much power strong : no makee kill you, though you makee 
him much angry. 

W, A. — What, will my wicked life hinder you from believing in 
Ood ? What a dreadful creature am I ! aud what a sad truth is it, 
tiiat the horrid lives of Christians hinder the conversion of heathens I 

Wife.—Ilow me think you have great much God up there [she 
points up to heaven], and yet no do well, no do good thing? Can 
he tell ? Sure he no tell what you do. 

W. A. — Yes, yes, he knows and sees all things ; he hears us speak, 
sees what we do, knows what we think, though we do not speak. 

Wife. — What ! he no hear you curse, swear, speak de great damn ? 

W. A, — Yes, yes, he hears it all. 

Wife. — ^Where be then the much great power strong ? 

W. A. — ^He is merciful, that is all we can say for it ; and this 
proves him to be the true Gk>d ; he is God, and not man, and there- 
fore we are not consumed. 

Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with horror, to think how 
he could tell his wife so clearly that God sees, and hears, and knows 
the secret thoughts of the heart, and all that we do, and yet that he 
had dared to do all the vile things he had done. 

Tr{/«.— Merciful ! What you call that ? 

W. A. — He is our Father and Mak^, and he pities and spares 
us. 

Wife. — So then he never makee kill, never angry when you do 
wicked ; then he no good himself, or no great able. 

W, -4.— Yes, yes, mj dear, he is infinitely good and infinitely 
great, and able to punish too ; and sometimes, to show his justice 
and vengeance, he lets fly his anger to destroy sinners and make ex- 
amples ; many are cut off in their sins. 

Wife. — But no makee kill you yet ; then he tell you, may be, that 
he no makee you kill : so you makee de bargain with him, you do 
bad thing, he no be angry at you when he be an^ry at other mans. 

W. A. — No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions upon his good- 
ness ; and he would be infinitely just if he destroyed me, as he has 
done other men. 

Wife. — Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead ; what you say 
to him for that ? You no tell him thankee lor all that too ? 

W. A. — 1 am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that is true. 

Wife. — Why he no makee you much good better? you say he 
makee you. 

W. A.^Re made me as he made all the world ; it is I have de- 
formed myself, and abused his goodness, and made myself an abom< 
inable wretch. 



302 BOBIKSOK CRUSOE. 

Wife. — ^I wish you makce €k)d know me. I no makee him angry. 
I no do bad wicked thing. 

Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him, to hear a poor 
untaught creature desire to be taught to know God, and he such a 
wicked wretch, that he could not say one word to her about God, 
but what the reproach of his own carriage would make most irra- 
tional to her to believe ; nay, that already she had told him that she 
could not believe in God, because he, that was so wicked, was not 
destroyed. 

TT. A. — Mv dear, you mean, you wish I could teach you to know 
God, not Goa to know you ; for he knows you already, and eveiy 
thought in your heart. 

Wife. — ^Why, then, he know what I say to you now ; he know me 
wish to know him. How shall me know who makee me ? 

W. A, — ^Poor creature, he must teach thee : I cannot teach thee. 
I will pray to him to teach thee to know him, and forgive me, that 
am unworthy to teach thee. 

The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring him to make 
her know God, and her wishing to krow him, that he said he fell 
down on his knees before her, and prayed to God to enlighten her 
mind with the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, and to pardon his 
sins, and accept of his being the unwoithy instrument of instructing 
her in the principles of religion : after which he sat down l)y her 
again, and their dialogue went on. This was the time when we saw 
him kneel down and hold up his hands. 

Wife. — What you put down the knee for ? Whatjou hold up the 
hand for ? What you say ? Who you speak to ? What is all Uiat ? 

W, -4.— My dear, I bow my knees in token of my submission to 
him that made me : 1 said O to him, as you call it, and as your old 
men do to their idol Benamuckee : that is, I prayed to him. 

Wife. — What say you O to him for ? 

W. A. — I prayed to him to open your eyes and your understanding, 
that you may know him, and be accepted by him. 

Fp.— Can he do that too ? 

W. A. — Yes, he can : he can do all things. 

Wife. — But now he hear what you say ? 

W. A. — Yes, he has bid us pray to him, and promised to hear us. 

Wife. — Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he bid you? 
What, you hear him speak ? 

W. A. — No, we do not hear him speak ; but he has rerealed him- 
self many ways to us. 

Here he was at a great loss to make her understand that €k)d 
has revealed himself to us by his word, and what his word was ; 
but at last he told it her thus : 

W, A, — God has spoken to some good men in former days, even 
from heaven, by plain words ; and God has inspired good men by 
his spirit ; and they have written all his laws down in a book. 



..ImJ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 303 

Wife. — Me no understand that ; where is book ? 

W. A. — Alas ! my poor creature, I have not this book ; but I hope 
1 shall one time or other get it for you. and help you to read it. 

Here he embraced her with great affection, but with inexpressible 
grief that he had not a Bible. 

Wife, — But how you makee me know that Gk)d teachee them to 
write that book ? 

W. A. — By the same rule that we know him to be God. 

Wife, — What rule ? What way you know him ? 

W. A. — Because he teaches and commands nothing but what is 
good, righteous, and holy, and tends to make us perfectly good, as 
well as perfectly happy ; and because he forbids, and commands us 
to avoid, all that is wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in its conse- 
quence. 

Wife. — That me would understand, that me fain see ; if he teachee 
all good thing, he makee all good thing, he give all thing, he hear 
me when I say O to him, as you do, just now ; he makee me good, 
if I wish to be good ; he spare me, no makee kill me, when I no be 
good : all this you say he do, yet he be great God : me takee, think, 
believe him to be great God ; me say O to him with you, my dear. 

Here the poor man could forbear no longer, but mised her up, 
made her kneel by him, and he prayed to Gcxl aloud to instruct her 
in the knowledge of himself, by his spirit, and that by some good 
providence, if possible, she might, some time or other, come to have 
a Bible, that she might read the Word of God, and be taught by it 
to know him. This was the time that we saw him lift her up by the 
hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above. 

They had several other discourses, it seems, after this, too long to be 
set down here ; and particularly she made him promise that, since 
he confessed his own life had been a wicked, abominable course of 
provocations against Grod, he would reform it, and not make God 
angry any more, lest he should make him dead, as she called it, and 
then she would be left alone, and never be taught to know this God 
better ; and lest he should be miserable, as he had told her wicked 
men would be, after death. 

This was a strange account, and very affecting to us both, but par- 
ticularly to the voung clergyman ; he was, indeed, wonderfully sur- 
prised with it, but under the greatest affliction imaginable that he 
could not talk to her, that he could not speak English, to make her 
understand him ; and as she spoke but very broken English, he could 
not understand her ; however, he turned himself to me, and told me 
that he believed that there must be more to do with this woman 
than to marry her. I did not understand him at first ; but at length 
he ei^plained himself, viz., that she ought to be baptized. I agreed 
witl^ bim in that pajrt readily, and w^ished it to be done presently, 
" No, no ; hold, sir," said he j " though I would have her be bap* 
^^t by ii\\ u^eai^-^tor I must objserve that WiU Atkins, hef l&us- 



3 04 ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 

band, has indeed brought her, in a wonderful manner, to be wOfing 
to embi-ace a religious life, and has given her just Ideas of the being 
of a God ; of his power, justice, ana mercy — ^yet I desire to know of 
him if he has said anything to her of Jesus Clirist, and of the Falva- 
tion of sinners ; of tlie nature of faith in him, and redemption by 
him ; of the Holy 8pirit, the resurrection, the last judgment, and the 
future state.** 

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him ; but the poor fellow 
fell immediately into tears, and told us he had said something to her 
of all those things, but that he was himself so wicked a creature, and 
his own conscience so reproached him with his horrid, ungodly life, 
that he trembled at the apprehensions that her knowledge of bim 
should lessen the attention she should give to those things and make 
her rather contemn religion than receive it ; but he was assured, he 
said, that her mind was so disposed to receive due impressions of all 
those things, and that if I would but discourse with her she would 
make it appear to my satisfaction that my labor would not be lost 
upon her. 

Accordingly' 1 called her in, and placriiig myself as interpreter be*- 
tween my religious priest and the woman, I entreated him to begin 
with her ; but sure such a sermon was never preached by a Popish 
priest in these latter ages of the world ; and, as I tokl him, I thought 
he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, all the sincerity of a Christian, 
without the error of a Roman Catholic ; and that I took him to be 
such a clergym^ as the Roman bishf^s were before the Church oi 
Rome assumed spiritual sovereignty over the consciences of men. 
In a word, he brought the poor woman to embrace the knowledge 
of Christ, and of redemption by him, not with wonder and astonish- 
ment only, as she did the first notions of a God, but with joy and 
faith ; with an affection and a surprising degree of understandings 
scarce to be imagined, much less to be expressed ; and at her own 
request she was baptized. 

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated him that he 
would perform that office with some caution, that the man might not 
perceive he was of the Roman Church, if possible, because of other 
ill consequences which might attend a difference among us in that 
very religion which we were instructing the other in. He told me 
that as he had no consecrated chapel, nor proper thmgs for the office, 
I should see he would do it in a manner that I should not know by it 
that he was a Roman Catholic myself if 1 had not known it before ; 
and so he did ; for saying only some words over to himself in Latin, 
which I could not understand, he poured a whole dishful of water 
upon the woman's head, pronouncing in French, very loud, ** Mary 
[which was the name her husband desired me to give her, for I was 
her godfather], I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the 
Son, and of the Holy Ghost ;" so that none could know anything 
by it what religion he was of. He gave the benedictien afterward in 



BOBINSOX CRUSOE. 306 

Latin, but either Will Atkins did not know but it was French, or else 
did not take notice of it at that time. 

As soon as this was over we married them ; and after the marriage 
was oyer, he tamed to Will Atkins, and in a very affectionate man- 
ner exhorted liim, not only to persevere in that good disposition he 
was in, but to support the convictions that were upon him by a resolu- 
tion to reform his life ; told him it was in vain to say he repented if 
he did not forsake his crimes : represented to him how God had hon- 
ored him with being the instrument of bringing his wife to the 
knowledge of the Christian religion, and that he should be careful 
be should not dishonor the grace of God ; and that if he did, he 
would see the heathen a better Christian than himself ; the savage 
converted, and the instrument cast away. He said a great many 
good things to them both ; and then, recommending them to God's 
goodness, trave them the benediction again, I repeating everything 
to them in English ; and thus ended the ceremony. I think it was 
the most pleasant and agreeable day to me that ever I passed io my 
whole life. 

But my clergyman had not done yet : his thoughts huns contin- 
ually upon the conversion of the thirty-seven savages, ana fain he 
would have staid upon the island to "have undertaken it ; but I con- 
vinced him, first, that his undertaking was impracticable in itself ; 
and, secondly, that perhaps I would put it into a way of being done 
in his absence to his satisfaction. 

Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a narrow compass, 
I was preparing to go on board the ship, when the young man I had 
taken out of the famished ship's company came to me and told me 
he understood I had a clergyman with me, and that I had caused the 
Englishmen to be married to the savages ; that h^ had a match too, 
which he desired might:.be finished before I went, between two Chris- 
tians, which he hopS would not be disagreeable to me. 

I knew this must be the young woman who was his mother's ser- 
vant, for there was no other Christian woman on the island : so I 
began to persuade him not to do anything of that kind rashly, or be- 
cause he round himself in this solitory cux;umstance. I represented 
to him that he had some considerable substance in the world, and 
good friends, as I understood by himself, and the maid idso ; that the 
maid was not only poor, and a servant, but was unequal to him, she 
being six or seven and twenty years old, and he not above seventeen 
or eighteen ; that he might very probably, with my assistance, make 
a remove from this wilderness, and come into his own country again ; 
and that then it would be a thousand to one but he would repent his 
choice, and the dislike of that circumstance might be disadvantageous 
to both. I was going to say more, but he interrupted me, smiling, 
and told me, with a great deal of modesty, that I mistook in my 
guesses — that he had nothing of that kind in his thou^ts ; and he 
was very glad to hear that I had an intent of putting thea in a way 



806 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

to see their own country again ; and nothing should have made him 
think of staying theie, but that the voyage I was going was so ex- 
ceeding long and hazardous, and would carry him quite out of the 
reach of all his friends ; that he had nothing to desire of mc, but that 
I would settle him in some little property in the island where he was, 
give him a servant or two, and some few necessaries, and he would 
WvG here like a planter, waiting the good time when, if ever 1 re- 
turned to England, I would redeem him ; and hoped I would not be 
unmindful of Him when I came to England : that he would give me 
some letters to his friends in London, to let them know how good I 
had been to him, and in what part of the world and what circum- 
stances I had left him in : and he promised me that whenever I re- 
deemed him, the plantation and all the improvements he had made 
upon it, let the value be what it would. Bht.uld be wholly mine. 

His discoui-se was very prettily delivered, consideiing his youth, 
and the more agreeable to me because he told me positively the 
match was not for himself. I gave him all possible assurances that 
if I lived to come safe to England, I would deliver his letters and 
do his business effectually ; and that he might depend I should never 
forget the circumstances I hati left him in ; but still I was impatient- 
to know who was the person to be married ; upon which he told me 
it was my Jack-of-all- trades and his maid Susan. I was most agree- 
ably surprised when he named the match ; for, indeed, I thought it 
very suitable. The character of that man I have given already ; and 
as for the maid, she was a very honest, modest, sober, and religious 
young woman ; had a very good share of sense, was agreeable enough 
in her person, spoke very handsomely and to the purpose, always with 
decency and good manners, and was neither too backward to speak 
when requisite, n^ impertinently forwnid when it was not her busi- 
ness ; very handy and housewifely, and an excellent manager ; fit, 
indeed, to have been governess to the whole island, and she knew 
very well how to behave in every respect. 

The match being proposed in this manner, we married them the 
same day ; and as I was father at the altar, and gave her r.way, so I 
gave her a portion ; for I appointed her and her husband a handsome 
large space of ground for their plantation ; and indeed this match, 
and the proposal the 3'oung gentleman made to givehima^mall prop- 
erty in the island, put me upon parcelling it out among them, that 
they might not quarrel afterward about their situation. 

Tiiis sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins, who was 
now grown a sober, grave, managing fellow, perfectly reformed, ex- 
ceedingly pious and religious ; and as far as 1 may be allowed to 
speak positively in such a case, I verily believe he was a true penitent. 
He divided things so justly, and so much to every one's satisfaction, 
that they only desired one general writing under my hand for the 
whole, which I caused to bo drawn up, and signed and sealed, setting 
out the bounds and situation of every man's plantation, and testifying 






ROBINSOK CRtrSOB. 307 

that I gave them thereby severally a riffht to the whole possession 
and inheritaace of the respective plantatious or farms, with their im- 
provements, to them and their heirs, reserving all the rest of the isl- 
and as my own property, and a certain rent for every particular 
plantation after eleven years, if I, or any one from me, or in my 
name, came to demand it, producing an attested copy of the same 
writing. 

As to the government and laws among them, I told them I was not 
capable of giving them better rules than they were able to give them- 
selves ; only I made them promise me to live in love and good neigh- 
borhood with one another ; and so I prepared to leave them. 

One thing I must not omit, and that is, that being now settled in a 
kind of commonwealth among themselves, and having much business 
in hand, it was odd to have seven-and thirty Indians live in a nook 
of the island, independent, and indeed unemployed ; for excepting 
the providing themselves food, which they had aifflculty enough to 
do, sometimes they had no manner of business or property to manage. 
I proposed, therefore, to the governor Spaniard, that he should go to 
them, with Friday's father, and propose to them to remove, and either 
plant for themselves or be taken into their several families as ser- 
vants, to be maintained for their labor, but without being absolute 
slaves ; for I would not permit them to make them slaves by force 
by any means ; because they had their liberty given them by capitu- 
lation, as it were articles of surrender, which they ought not to break. 

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came all very 
cheerfully along with him : so we allotted them land and plantations, 
whicli Ihiee or four accepted of, but all the rest chose to be employed 
as servants in the several families we bad settled ; and thus my colony 
was in a manner settled as follows : The Spaniards possessed my 
original habitation, which was the capital city, and extended their 
plantations all along the side of the brook, which made the creek 
that I have so often described, as far as my bower ; and as they in- 
creased their culture, it went always eastward. The English lived 
in the north-e^t part, where Will Atkins and his comrades began, 
and came on southward and suuth-west, toward the back part of the 
Spaniards ; and every plantation had a great addition of land to take 
in, if they found occasion, so that they need not jostle one another 
for want of room. All the east end of the island was left uninhab- 
ited, that if any of the savages should come on shore there obly for 
their usual customary barbarities, they might come and go ; if they 
disturbed nol)ody, nobody would disturb them : and no doubt but 
they were often ashore, and' went away again ; for I never heard that 
the planters were ever attacked or disturbed any more. 

It now came into my thoughts that I had hinted to my friend the 
clergyman that the work of converting the savages might perhaps be 
set on foot in his absence to his satisfaction, and I told him that now 
I thought that it was put in a fair way ; for the savages, being thus 



308 BOBIKSGX CRUSOE, 

divided among the Christiaiis, if thej would but every one of them 
do their part with those which came under their hands, I hoped it 
might have a very good effect. 

He agreed presently in that, if they did their part ** But how/* 
says he, " shall we obtain that of them V* I told him we would call 
them all together, and leave it in charge with them, or go to them, 
one by one, which he thought best ; so we divided it — he to speak to 
the Spaniards, who were all Papists, and I to speak to the English, 
who were all Protestants ; and we recommended it earnestly to them, 
and made them promise that they would never make any distinction 
of Papist or Protestant in their exhorting the savages to turn Chris- 
tians, bnt teach them the general knowMge of the true God, and of 
their Saviour Jesus Christ ; and they likewise promised us that they 
would never have any differences or disputes one. with another al)out 
religion. 

When I came to Will Atkins* house (I may call it so, for such 
a house, or such a piece x)f ba^et-work, I believe was not standing in 
the world again), there I found the yuung woman I have mentioned 
above and Will Atkins* wife were become intimates ; and this pru- 
dent, religious young woman had perfected the work Will Atkins 
had begun ; and though it was not above four days after what I have 
related, yet the new-baptized savage woman was made such a Chris- 
tian as I have seldom heaid of in all my observation or conversation 
in the world. 

It came next into my mind in the morning before I went to them, 
that among all the neeaf ul things I had to leave with them I had 
not left them a Bible, in which I iriiowed myseif less considering for 
them than my good friend the widow was for me when she sent me 
the cargo of a hundred pounds from Lisbon, where she packed up 
three Bibles and a Prayer-book. However, the good woman's char- 
ity had agi^ater extent than ever.she imagined, for they were reservtKl 
for the comfort and instruction oi those that made much better use 
of them than I bad done. 

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I came to Will At- 
kins* tent or house and found <he young woman ana Atkins* bap- 
tized wife had been discoursing of religion together— for Will Atkins 
told it me with a great deal of joy— I asked if they were together now, 
and he said yes ; so I went into the bouse and he with me ; and we 
found them U^ether very earnest in discourse. *' Oh, sir,** savs Will 
Atkins, '* when God has sinners to reconcile to himself, and aliens 
to bring home, he never wants a messenger : my wife has got a new 
instructor : I knew I was unworthy as I was incapable of thAt work ; 
that young woman has been sent hither from heaven ; she is enough 
to convert a whole island of sava^.*' The young woman bludied, 
and rose up to go away, but I desired her to sit still ; I told her she 
had a good work upon her hands, imd 1 hoped God would bless her 
in it. 



B0BIN80K CRUSOE. 309 

We talked a little, and I did not perceive that they had any hook 
among them, though I did not ask ; but I put my hand into my 
pocket and pulled out my Bible. ** Here/' said I to Atkins, " I have 
brought you an assistant that pertiaps you had Aot before/' The 
man was so confounded that he was not able to speak for some 
time ; but, recovering himself, he takes it with both his hands, and 
turning to his wife, ** Here, my dear," savs he, ** did I not tell you 
our God, though he lives above, could hear what we have said? 
Here's the book I prayed for when you and I kneeled down under 
the bush ; now God has heard us, and sent it." When he had said 
so, the man fell into^such transports of passionate joy that between 
the joy of having it and giving God ttuuiks for it, the tears ran down 
his face like a child that was crying. 

The woman was surprised, and was like to have run into a mistake 
that none of us were aware of, for die firmly believed God had seat 
the book upon her husband's petition. It is true that providentially 
it was so, and might be taken so in a consequent sense ; but I be- 
lieve it would have been no difficult matter at that time to have per- 
suaded the poor woman to have believed that an express messenger 
came from heaven on purpose to bring that individual book ; but it was 
too serious a matter to suffer any delusion to take place ; so I turned to 
the young woman, and told her we did not desire to impose upon the 
new convert in her first and more ignorant understanding of things, 
and Ijegged her to explain to her that God may be very properly said 
to answer our petitions, when in the course of his providence such 
things are in a particular manner brought to pass as we petitioned 
for : but we did not expect returns f rcmi heaven in a miraculous and 
particular numner, and it is a mercy that it is not so. 

This the young woman did afterward effectually, so that there 
was, 1 assure you, no priestcraft used here ; and I should have 
thought it one of the most unjustifiable frauds in the world to have 
had ft so. But the surprise of joy upon Will Atkins is really not to 
be expressed ; and there we may be sure was no delusion. Sure no 
man was ever more thankful in the world for anything of its kind 
than he was for the Bible — nor, I believe, never any man was glad 
of a Bible from a better principle ; and though he had been a most 
profligate creature, headstrong, furious, and desperately wicked, yet 
this man is a standing rule to us all for the well instructing children, 
viz., that parents should never give over to teach and instruct, nor 
ever despair of the success of their endeavors, let the children be 
eyer so refractory, or, to appearance, insensible to instruction ; for if 
ever Qod in his prxividence touches the conscience of such, the force 
of their education returns upon th(>m. and the early instruction of 
parents is not lost, tliough it may have been many years laid asleep, 
but some time or other they may find the benefit of it. Thus it was 
with this poor mian : however ignorant he was of religion and Chris- 
tiaa knowledge, be found he had some to do with now more ignorant 



310 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

than himself, and that the least part of the instruction of his good 
^ father tliat now came to his mind was of use to hlui. 

Among the rest, it occurred to him, he said, how his father used to 
insist no much on*the inexpressible value of the Bil)le, and iha privi- 
lege and blessing of it to nations, Tamilies, and persons ; but he never 
entertained the least notion of the worth of it till now, when, being 
to talk to heathens, savages, and barbarians, he wanted the help of 
the written oracle for his assistance. 

The young woman was glad of it also for the present occasion, 
though she had one, and so had the youth, on board our ship, amdng 
their goods, which were not yet brought on shore. And now, hav- 
ing said so many things of this young woman» I cannot omit telling 
one story more of her and myself, which has something in it very 
instructive and remarkable. ' 

I have related to what extremity the poor young woman was re- 
duced — how her mistress was starved to death, and died on board 
that unhappy ship we met at sea, and how the whole ship's company 
was reduced to tbeiast extremity. The gentlewoman and her son 
and this maid were first hardly used as to provisions, and at last to- 
tally neglected and started — that is to say, brought to the last ex- 
tremity of hunger. One day, being discoursing with her on the ex- 
tremities they suffered, I asked her if she could describe, by what 
she had felt, what it was to starve, and how it appeared ? She told 
me she believed she could, and she told her tale very distinctly, 
thus : 

"First, sir,'* said the, "we had for some days fared exceeding 
hard, and ^uffered very great hunger ; but at last we were wholly 
without food of any kind, except sugar and a little wine-and-water. 
The first day after I had received no food at all, I found myself, tow- 
ard evening, first empt^ and sic^ at the stomach, and nearer night 
much inclined to yawnmg and sleep. I lay down on the couch in 
the great cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, and awaked a 
little refreshed, having taken a glass of wine when I lay down ; 
after being about three hours awake, it being about five o'clock in 
the morning, 1 found myself empty and my stomach sickish, and 
lay down again, but could not sleep at all, being very faint and ill ; 
and thus I continued all the second day with a strange variety — first 
hungry, then sick again, with retchings to vomit. The second night, 
being obliged to go to bed again without any fooH more than a 
draught of fresh water, and being asleep I dreamed I was at Barbadoes, 
and that the market was mightily stocked with provisions — that I 
bought some for my mistress and went and dined very heartily. I 
thought my stomach was as full after this as it would have been after 
a ^o^ dinner ; but when I awaked I wa^ exceedingly sunk in my 
spirits to find myself in the extremity of famine. The last glass of 
wine we had I drank, and put sugar in it because of its having some 
spirit to supply nourishment ; but there being no substance in the 



ROBIKSON CRUSOE. 311 

Btomacli for the digesting office to work upon, I found the only 
effect of the wine was to raise disagreeable fumes from the stomach 
into the head ; and I lay, as they told me, stupid and senseless, as 
one drunk, for some time. The third day, in the morniDg, after a 
night of strange, confused, and inconsistent dreams, and rather doz- 
ing than sleeping, 1 awaked ravenous and furious with hunger ; 
and I question, had not my understanding returned and conquered 
it, whether, if I had been a mother, and had had a little child with 
me, its life would have been safe or not. This lasted about three 
hours, during which time I was twice raiding mad as any creature in 
Bedlam, as my youn^ master told me, and as ho can now* inform you. 

" In one of those fits of lunacy or distraction I fell down and struck 
my face against the comer of a pallet-bed, in which my mistress lay, 
and with the blow the blood gushed out of my nose ; and the cabin- 
boy bringing me a little basin, I sat down and bled into it a great 
deal ; and as the blood came from me, I came to myself, and the 
violence of the flame or fever I was in abated, and so did the ravenous 
part of the hunger. Then I grew sick, and retched to vomit, but 
could not, for I had nothing in my stomach to bring up. After I had 
bled some time I f^wooned, and they all believed I was dead ; but I 
came to myself soon after, and then had a most dreadful pain in my 
stomach not to be described — not like the colic, but a gnawing, eager 
pain for.food ; and toward night it went off with a kind of earnest 
wishing or longing for food, something like, as I suppose, the long- 
ing of a woman with child. I took another draught of water with 
sugar in it ; but my stomach loathed the sugar, and brought it all 
up again ; then I took a draught of water without sugar, and that 
staid with me ; and I laid me down upon the bed, praying most 
heart! tjr that it would please God to take me away ; and composing 
my mmd in hopes of it, I slumbered awhile, and then waking, 
thought myself dying, being light with vapors from an empty stom- 
ach. I recommended my soul then to God, and earnestly wished 
that somebody would throw me into the sea. 

•* All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I thought^ expir- 
ing, but bore it with nmch more patience than I — gave the last bit 
of bread she had left to her child, my young master, who would not 
have taken it, but she obliged him to eat it ; and I believe it saved 
his life. 

** Toward the morning I slept again ; and when I awoke I fell into 
a violent passion of crymg, and after that had a second fit of violent 
hunger. I got up ravenous, and in a most dreadful condition ; had 
my mistress been dead, as much as I loved her, I am certain I should 
have"^ eaten a piece of her flesh with as much reMsh and as uncon- 
cerned as ever I did eat the flesh of any creature appointed for food ; 
and once or twice I was going to bite my own arm. At last I saw 
the basin in which was the blood I had b^ed at my nose the day be- 
fore-: I ran to it, and swallowed it with much haste, and such a greedy 



312 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

appetite, as if I wondered nobody had taken it before, and afndd 
it sliould bo taken from me now. After it was down, though ti^e 
thoughts of it filled me with horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger, 
and I took another draught of water, and was composed and re- 
freshed for some hours after. This was the fourth day ; and thus I 
kept up till toward ni^ht, when, within the compass of three hours, 
I had all the several cu'cumstances over again, one after another, viz., 
sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain in the stomach, then ravenous 
again, then sick, then lunatic, then crying, then ravenous again, and 
so every quarter of an hour, and my strength veasted exceedingly ; at 
night I lay me down, having no comfort Siit in the hope that I should 
die before morning. 

"All this night I had no sleep ; but the hunger was now turned 
into a disease ; and I had a terrible colic and giipmg, by wind, instead 
of food, having found its way into the bowels ; and in this condition 
I lay till morning, when I was surprised by the cries and lam^itationa 
of my young master, who called out to me that his mother was dead. 
I lifted myself up a little, for I had not strength to rise, but found 
she was not dead, though she was able to give very little signs of life. 

*' I had then such convulsions in my stomach, for want of sonie 
sustenance, as I cannot describe ; with such frequent throes and 
pangs of appetite as nothing but the tortures of dt^th can i£nitate ; 
and in this condition I was when I heard the seamen above cry out, 
* A sail ! a soil I ' and halloo and jump about as if they were dis- 
tracted. 

'' I was not able to get off from the bed, and my mistress much 
less ; and my young master was so sick that I thought he had- been 
expiring ; so we could not open the cabin door, or get any account 
what it was that occasioned such confusion ; nor had we had any 
conversation with the ship's company for two days, they haying told 
us that they bad not a mouthful of anything to eat in the ship ; and 
this they told us afterward— they thought we had been dead. It was 
this dreadful condition we were in when you were sent to save our 
lives ; ^md how you found us, sir, you know as well as I, and better 
too." 

This was her own relation, and is such a distinct account of starv- 
ing to death as, I confess, I never met with, and was exceeding en- 
tertaining to me. I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true ac- 
count, because the youth gave me an account of a good part of it ; 
though I must own not so distinct and so feeling as the maid ; and 
the rather because it seems his mother fed him at the price of her 
own life : but the poor maid, though her constitution being strongs 
than that of her mistress, who was in years, and a weakly woman, 
too, she might struggle harder with it ; I say, the poor maid might 
be supposca to feel the extremity something sooner than her mis- 
tress, who might be allowed to keep the last bit scunething longer 
thAa ab» parted with any to relieve the maid. No qjuestioa, as tfatt

case is here related, if onr ship, or some other, had not so providen- 
tially met thein, a few days more would have ended all their lives, 
imless they had prevented it by eating one another ; and tliat even, 
as their case stood, would have served them but a little while, they 
being five hundred leagues from any land, or any possibility of relief 
other than in the miraculous manner it iiappened : but this is by the 
way ; I return to my disposition of things among the people. 

And, first, it is to be observed here, that for many reasons I did 
not think fit to let them know anything of the sloop I had framed, 
and which I thought of setting up among them ; for I found, at least 
at my first coming, such seeds of division among them, that I saw 
plainly, had I set up the sloop and left it among them, they would, 
upon every light disgust, have separated, and gone away from one 
another ; or perhaps have turned pirates, and so made the island a 
den of thieves instead of a plantation of sober and religious people, 
as I intended it ; nor did I leave the two pieces of brass cannon that 
I had on board, or the two quarter-deck guns that my nephew took 
extraordinary, for the same reason : I thought it was enough to 
qualify them for a defensive war against any that should invade Uiem, 
but not to set them up for an offensive war, or to go abroad to attack 
others ; which, in the end, would only bring rum and destruction 
upcm them : I reserved the sloop, therefore, and the guns, for their 
service another way, as I shall observe in its place. 

Having now done with the island, I left them all in good circum- 
stences, and in a flourishing condition, and went on board my ship 
again on the 6th of May, having been about twenty-five days among 
them ; and as they were all resolved to stay upon the island till I 
came to remove them, I promised to send them further relief from 
the Brazils, if 1 could possibly find an opportunity ; and particularly 
I promised to send them some cattle, such as sheep, hogs, and cows : 
as to the two cows and calves which I brought from England, we 
had been obliged, by the length of our voyage, to kill them at sea, 
for want of hay to feed them. 

The next day, giving them a salute of five guns at parting, we set 
sail, and arrived at the Bay of All Saints in the Brazils, m about 
twenty-two days, meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but 
this : that about three days after we had sailed, being becalmed, and 
the current setting strong to the E.N.E., running, as it were, into a 
bay or gulf on the land side, we were driven something out of our 
eourse, and once or twice our men cried out, '* Land to the east- 
ward V* but whether.it was the continent or islands we could not tell 
by any means. But thft third day, toward evening, the sea smooth 
and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were, covered toward the 
land with something very black ; not being able to discover what it 
was till after some tjme, our chief mate, going up the main-shrouda 
a little way, and looking at them with a perspective, cried out it was 
an army. I could not imagine what he meant by an army, and 



314 K0BIK80N CRUSOE. 

thwarted him a little hastily. ** Nay, sir/' says he, ** don't be an- 
gry, for 'tis an army, and a' fleet too ; for I believe there are a thou- 
sand canoes, and you may see them paddlealung, for they are coming 
toward us apace. 

I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my nephew the 
captain ; for he had heard such terrible stories-of tliem'in the island, 
and having never been in those seas before, that he could not tell 
what to think of it, but said, two or three times, we should all be de- 
voured I must confess, considermg we were becalmed, and the cur- 
rent set strong toward the shore, I liked it the worse ; however, I 
bade them not be afraid, but bring the ship to an anchor as soon as 
we came so near as to know that we must engage them. 

The weather continued calm, and they came on apace toward us ; 
so I gave orders to come to an anchor, and furl all out sails ; as for 
the savages, I told them they had nothing to fear but fire, and there- 
fore they should get their boats out, and fasten them, one doee by 
the head, and the other by the stern, and man them both well, and 
wait the issue in that posture : this I did that the men in the boats 
might be ready with sheets and buckets lu put out any fire these sav- 
ages might endeavor to fix to the outside of the ship. 

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while they came up 
with us ; but never was such horrid sight seen by Christians : though 
my mate was much mistaken in his calculation of their number, yet 
when they came up we reckoned about a hundred and twenty-six ; 
some of them had sixteen or seventeen men in them, and some more, 
and the least six or seven. 

When they came neaier to us, they seemed to be struck with wonder 
and astonishment, as at a sight which doubtless they had never seen 
before; nor could they at first, ns we afterward understood, know 
what to make of us ; they came boldly up, however, very near to us, 
and seemed to go about to row round us ; but we called to our men 
in the boats not to let them come too near them. This very order 
brought us to an engagement with them, without our designing it ; for 
^ve or six of the large canoes came so near our long-boat that our 
men beckoned with their hands to keep them back, which they under- 
stood vety well, and went back : but at their retreat about fifty ar- 
rows came on board us fn>m those boats, and one of our men iu the 
long-boat was very much wounded. However, I called to them not 
to fire by any means ; but we handed down some deal boards into the 
boat, and the carpenter presently set up a kind of fence, like waste 
boards, to cover them from the arrows of the savages, if they should 
shoot again. 

About half an hour afterward they all came up in a body astern of 
us, and so near that we could easily discern what they were, though 
we could not tell (heir design ; and I easily found they were some of 
my old friends, the same sort of savages that I had been used to en- 
gage with ; and in a short time more they rowed a little farther out 



ROBINSOiT CRUSOE. 315 

to sea, till they came directly broadside with us, and then rowed 
down straight upon us, till they came so near that they could hear us 
speak ; upon this I ordered all my men to keep close, lest they should 
shoot any more arrows, and made all our guns ready ; but being so 
near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go out upon the deck, 
and call out aloud to them in his language, to know what they meant ; 
which accordingly he did. Whether they understood him or not, that 
I knew not ; but as soon as he hpd called to them, six of them, who 
were in the foremost or nighest boat to us, turned their canoes from 
us, and stooping down, showed us their naked backs ; whether this 
was a defiance or challenge we knew not, or whether it was done in 
more contempt, or as a signal to the rest : but immediately Friday 
cried out they were going to shoot, and unhappily for him, poor 
fellow, they let fly about three hundred of their arrows, and, to my 
inexpressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other man being in their 
sight. The poor fellow was shot with no less than three arrows, and 
about three more fell very near him ; such unlucky marksmen they 
were 1 

I was so enraged at the loss of my old trusty servant and compan- 
ion that I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with small 
shot, and four with great, and gave them such a broadside as they 
had never heard in their lives before, to be sure. They were not 
above half a cable's length off when we fired ; and our gunners took 
their aim so well that three or four of their canoes were overset, as 
live had reason to believe, by one shot only. 

The ill manners of turning up their bare backs to us gave us no 
great offence ; neither did I know for certain whether that which 
would pass for the greatest contempt among us might be understood 
so by them or not ; therefore, in return, I liad only resolved to have 
fired four or five guns at them with powder only, which I knew 
would frighten them suflBciently ; but when they shot at u^ directly 
with all the fury they were capable of, and especially as they had 
killed my poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved and valued, and 
who indeed so well deserved it, I thought myself not only justifiable 
before God and man, but would have been very glad if I could have 
'overset every canoe lliere, and drowned every one of them. 

I can neither tell how many we killed not how many we wounded 
at this broadside, but sure such a fright and hurry never were seen 
among such a multitude : there were thirteen or fourteen of their 
canoes split and overset in all, and the men all set a-swimming : the 
rest, frightened out of their wits, scoured away as fast as tbey could, 
taking but little care to save thqpe whose boats were split or spoiled 
with our shot ; so I suppose that many of them were lost ; and our 
men took up one poor fellow swimming for his life, above an hour 
after they were all gone. 

The small shot from our cannon must needs kill and wound a great 
many ; but, in short, we never knew how it went with Ihem, for 



316 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

they fled so fdst that in three hours or thereabout we coaM not see 
above three or four straggling canoes, nor did we ever see the rest 
any more ; for a breeze of wind springing up the same evening, we 
weighed and set sail for the Brazils. 

We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was so sullen that he 
would neither eat nor speak, and we all fancied he would starve 
himself to death : but I toolc a way to cure him ; for I made them 
. take him and turn him into the long-boat, and make him believe they 
would toss him. into the sea again, and so leave him where they found 
him, if he would not speak : nor would that do, but they really did 
throw him into the sea, and came away from hrm ; and then he fol- 
lowed them, for he swam like a cork, and called to them in his 
tongue, though they knew not one word of what he said ; however, 
at last they took him in again, and then he began to be more trac- 
table : nor did 1 ever design they should drc wn nim. 

We were now under sail again, but I was the most disconsolate 
c feature alive for want of my man Friday, and would hare been very 
glad to have gone back to the island, to have taken oce of the rest 
from thence for my occasion, but it could not be : so we went <wi. 
We had one prisoner, as I have said, and it was a long time before 
we could make him understand anything ; but in time our men 
taught him some English, and he began to be a little tractable. 
Afterward we inquired what country he came from, but could make 
nothing of What he said ; for his speech was so odd, all gutturals, 
and he spoke in the throat in such a hollow, odd manner that we 
could never form a word after him ; and we were all of opinion that 
they might speak that language as well if they were gngg^ as other- 
wise ; nor could we perceive that they had any occasion either for 
teeth, tongue, lips, or palate, but formed their words just as a hunt- 
ing-horn forms a tune with an open throat. He told us, however, 
some time after, when we had taught him to speak a little English, 
that thev were going with their kings to fight a great battle. When 
he said kings, we asked him how many kings ? He said they were 
five nation (we could not make him undetstand the plural a), and 
that they all joined to go against two nation. We asked him what 
made them come up to us? He said, " To makee te great wonder 
look." Here it is to be observed that all those natives, as also those 
of Africa, when they learn English, always add two e*s at the end of 
the words where we use one ; and they place the accent upon them, 
as mak6e, tak6e, and the like ; nay, I could hardly make Friday leave 
it off, though at last he did. 

And now I name the poor fellow pace more, I must take my last 
leave of him. Poor honest Friday I We buried him with all the de- 
cency and solemnity possible, by putting him into a coltln and 
throwing him into the sea ; and I caused them to fire eleven guns 
for him ; and so ended the life of the most grateful, faithful, honest, 
and most affectionate servant that ^rer man had. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 317 

We went sow away with a fair wind for Brazil ; and in about 
twelve daj8* lime we made land, in the latitude of Ave degrees south 
of the line, being the north-easternmost land of all that part of 
America. We kept on 8. by E. , in sight of the shore, four days, 
when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in three days came to an 
anchor off the Bay of All Saints, the old place of my deliverance, 
from whence came both my good and evil fate. 

Never ship came to this port that had less business than I had ; 
and yet it was with great diOiculty that we were admitted io hold the 
least correspondence on shore : not my partner himself, who was 
alive, and made a great figure among them, not my two merchant- 
trustees, not the fame of my wonderful preservation in the island, 
could obtain me that favor ; but my partner, remembering that I had 
given five hundred moidores to the prior of the Monastery of the 
Augustines, and two hundred and seventy- two to the poor, went tT> 
the monastery, and obliged the prior that then was to go to the gov- 
ernor, and get leave for me personally, with the captain and one 
more, besides eight seamen, to come on shore, and no more ; and this 
upon condition, absolutely capitulated for, that we should not offer to 
land any goods out of the ship, or to carry any person away without 
license. They were so strict with us, as to landing any goods, that 
it was with extreme difficulty that I got on shore three bales of Eng- 
lish goods, such as fine broadcloths, stuffs, and some linen, which I 
had brought for a present to my partner. 

He was a very generous, open-hearted man ; though, like me, ho 
began with little at fii*st ; and though he knew not that I had the least 
design of giving him anything, he sent me on board a present of 
fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth above thirty moidores, 
including some tobacco, and three or four fine medals of gold : but 
I was even with him in my present, which, as I have said, consisted 
of fine broadcloth, English stuffs, lace, and fine Hollands , also, I 
delivered him about the value of one Imndred pounds sterling, in the 
same goods, for other uses ; and I obliged him to set up the sloop 
which I had brought with me from England, as I have said, for the 
use of my colony, in order to send the refreshments I intended to my 
plantation. 

Accordingly he got hands and finished the sloop in a very few 
days, for she was already f ramed* ; and I gave the master of her such 
instructions that he could not miss the place ; nor did he, as I had an 
account from my partner afterward. I got him soon loaded with the 
small cargo I sent them ; and one of our seamen, that had been on 
shore with me there, offered to go with the sloop and settle there, 
upon my letter to the governor Spaniard, to allot him a sufficient 
quantity of land for a plantation, and giving him some clothes and 
tools for his planting work, which he said he understood, having been 
an old planter at Maryland, and a buccaneer into the bargain. I en- 
couraged the fellow by granting all he desired ; and, as an addition, 



318 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

I gave him the savage whom we had taken prisoner of war, to be 
his slave, and ordered the governor Spaniard to give him his share of 
everything he wanted witli the rest. 

When we came to fit tliis man out, my old partner told me there 
was a certain very honest fellow, a Brazil planter of his acqusdntance, 
who had fallen mto the displeasure of the church. ** I know not 
what the matter is with him," says he, ** but, on my conscience, I 
think he is a heretic in his heart, and he has been obliged to conceal 
himself for fear of the Inquisition ;'* that he would be very glad of 
such an opportunity to make his escape, with his wife and two 
daughters ; and if I would let them go to my island, and allot them 
a plantation, he would give them a small stock to begin with — for 
the officers of the Inquisition had seized all his effects and estate, and 
he had nothing left but a little household stuff and two slaves : 
**^nd,'* adds he, ** though I hate his principles, yet I would not have 
him fall into their hands, for he will be assuredly burned alive if he 
does." 

I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with them ; 
and we concealed the man and his wife and daughters on board our 
ship till the sloop put out to go to sea ; and then, having put all their 
goods on board some time before, we put them on board the sloop 
after she was got out of the bay. 

Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new partner ; and their 
stocks, indeed, were much alike, rich in tools, in preparations, and 
a farm — but nothing to begin with, except as above : however, they 
carried o^er with them, what was worth all the rest, some materials 
for planting sugar-canes, with some plants of 'canes, which he — I 
mean the Portugal man — understood very well. 

Among the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants in the island, I 
sent them by the sloop three milch-cows and fivo calves, about 
twenty-two hogs among them, three sows big with pig, two marcs, 
and a stone-horse. For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I 
engaged three Portugal women to go, and recommended it to them 
to marry them, and use them kindly. I could have procured more 
women, but I remembered that the poor persecuted man had two 
daughters, and that there were but five of the Spaniards that wanted 
— the rest had wives of their own, though in another country. 

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily suppose, was 
very welcome to my old inhabitants, who were now, with this addi- 
tion, between sixty and seventy people, besides little children, of 
which there were a great many. I found letters at London from 
them all, by way of Lisbon, when I came back to England, of which 
I shall also take some notice immediately. 

I have now done with the island, and all manner of discourse 
about it : and whoever reads the rest of my memorandums would do 
well to turn his thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read of the 
follies of an old man, not warned by his own haims, much less by 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 319 

those of other men, to beware ; not cooled by almost forty years' 
miseries and disappointments — not satisfied with prosperity beyond 
expectation, nor made cautious by afflictions and distress beyond 
imitation. 

I had no more business to go to the East Indies than a man at full 
liberty has to go to the turnkey at Newgate and desire him to lock 
him up among the prisoners there, and starve him. Had I taken a 
small vessel from England, and gone directly to the island ; had I 
loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with all the necetisaries for 
the plantation and for my people : taken a patent from the govern- 
ment here to have secured my property, in subjection only to that of 
England ; had I carried over cannon ahd ammunition, servants and 
people to plant, and taken possession of the place, fortified and 
strengthened it in the name of England, and increased it with people, 
as I might easily have done ; had I then settled myself there, and 
sent the ship back laden with good rit;e, as I might also have done in 
six months' time, and ordered my friends to have fitted her out again 
for our supply — had I done this, and staid there myself, I had at least 
acted like a man of common-sense : but I was possessed of a wander- 
ing spirit, and scorned all advantages : I pleased myself with bein^ 
the patron of the people I placed there, and doing for them in a kind 
of haughty, majestic way, like an old patriarchal monarch, provid- 
ing for Ihem as if I had been father of the whole family, as well as 
of the plantation : but I never so much as pretended to plant in the 
name of any government or nation, or to acknowledge any prince, or 
to call my people subjects to any one nation more than another ; nay, 
I never so much as gave the place a name, but left it as I found it, 
belonging to nobody, and the people under no discipline or govern- 
ment but my own ; who, though I had influence over them as a 
father and l)enefactor, had no authority or power to act or command 
one way or other, further than voluntary consent moved them to 
comply : yet even this, had I staid there, would have done well 
enough ; but as I rambled from them, and came there no more, the 
last letters I had from any of them were by my partner's means, who 
afterward sent another sloop to the place, and who sent me word, 
though I had not the letter till I got to London, several years after it 
was written, that they went on but poorly, were discontent with 
their long stay there ; that Will Atkins was dead— that five of the 
Spaniards were come away — and though they had not been much 
molested by the savages, yet they had had some skirmishes with 
them ; and* that they begged of him to write to me to think of the 
promise I had made to letch them away, that they might see their 
country again before they died. 

But I was gone a wild-goose chase indeed ! and they that will 
have any more of me must be content to follow me into a new variety 
of follies, hardships, and wild adventures, wherein the justice of 
Providence may be duly observed ; and we may see how easily Heaven 



320 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

can gorge us with our own desires, make the strongest of oi^r wishes 
be our affliction, and punish us most severely with those very things 
which we think it would be our utmost happiness to bo allowed in. 
"Whether I had business or no business, away I went : it is no time 
now to enlarge upon the reason or absurdity of my own conduct ; but 
to come to the history — I was embarked for the voyage, and the voy- 
age I went. 

I shall only add a word or two concerning my honest Popish cler- 
gyman ; for let their opinions of us, and all other heretics in general, 
as they call us, be as uncharitable as it may, I verily believe this man 
was very sincere, and wished the good of all men : yet I brieve he 
was upon the reserve in many of his expressions, to prevent giving 
me offence ; for I scarce heard him once call on the Blessed Virgin, 
or mention 8t. Jago. or his guardian angel, though so common with 
the rest of them : however, I say, I had not the least doubt of his 
sincerity and pious intentions ; and I am firmly of opinion, if the 
rest of the Popish missionaries were like him, they would strive to 
visit even the poor Tartars and Laplanders, where they have nothing 
to give them, as well as covet to flock to India, Persia, China, etc., 
the most wealthy of the heathen countries ; for if they expected to 
bring no gains to their church by it, it may well be admired how they 
came to sSmit the Chinese Confucius into the calendar of the Chris- 
tian saints. 

A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon, my pious priest asked me 
leave to go thither ; being still, as he observed, bound never to 
finish any voyage he began. How happy it had been for me if I had 
gone with him ! But it was too late now : all things Heaven appoints 
for the best : had I gone with him I had never had so many thiogs^ 
to be thtinkful for, and the reader had never heard of the second part 
of the travels and adventures of Robinson Crusoe ; so I must here 
leave exckcSming at myself, and go on with my voyage. From the 
Brazils we made directly over the Atlantic 8ca to the Cape of Good 
Hope, and had a tolerably good voyage, our course generally south- 
east, now And then a storm, and some contrary winds : but my dis- 
asters at sea were at an end— my future rubs and cross events were 
to befaQ tne on shore, that it might appear the land was as well pre- 
pared to be our scourge as the s«a. 

Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo on board, 
who was to direct all her motions after she arrived at the Cape, only 
being limited to a certain number of days for stay, by charter-party, 
at the several ports bhe was to go to. This was none of my business, 
neither did I meddle with it ; my nephew, the captain, and the super- 
cargo adjusting all those things between them as they thought fit. 

We staid at the Cape no longer than was needful to take in fresh 
water, but made the best of our way for the coast of Coromandel. 
We were, indeed, informed that a French man-of-wju*, of fifty guns, 
^d two large merchant ships, were gone for the Indies ; and as I

ROBINSON CRUSOK 321 

knew we were at war with France, I had some apprehensions of 
them ; but they went their own way, and we heard no more of them. 

I shall not pester the reader witli a tedious description of places, 
journals of our voyages, variations of the compass, latitudes, trade 
winds, etc. ; it is enough to name the ports and places which we 
touched at, and what occurred to us upon our passage from one to 
another. We touched first at the Island of Madagascar, where, 
though the people are fierce and treacherous, and very well armed 
with lances and bows, which they use with inconceivable dexterity, 
yet we fared very well with them awhile ; they treated us very civ- 
illy ; and for some trifles which we gave them,' such as knives, scis- 
sors, etc., tfiey brought us eleven good fat bullocks, of a middling 
size, which we took in, partly for fresh pro?isions for our present 
spending, and the rest to salt for the ship's use. 

We were obliged to stay here some time after we had furnished 
ourselves with provisions ; and I, who was always too curious to 
look into every nook of the world wherevec I came, went on shore 
as often as I could. It was on the east side of the island that we 
went on shore one evening : and the people, who, by the way, are 
very numerous, came thronging about us, and stood gazing at us at 
a distance : but as we had traded freely with them, and had been 
kindly used, we thought ourselves in no danger ; but when we saw 
the people, we cut three boughs out of a tree, and stuck them up at 
a distance from us ; which, it seems, is a mark in that country, not 
only of a truce and friendship, but when it is accepted the other 
side set up three poles or boughs, which is a signal that they accept 
the truce too ; but then this is a known condition of the truce, that 
you are not to pass beyond their three poles toward them, nor they 
to come past your three poles or boughs toward you ; so that you 
are perfectly secure within the three poles, and all the space between 
your poles and theirs is allowed like a market for free converse, 
traffic, and commerce. When you go there, you must not carry your 
weapons with you : and if they come into that space, they stick, up 
their javelins and li^ices all at the first poles, and come on unarmed ; 
but if any violence is oflPered them, and the truce thereby broken, 
away they run to the poles, and lay hold of their weax>ons, and the 
truce is at an end. 

It happened one evening, when we went on shore, that a greater 
number of their people came down than usual, but all very friendly 
and civil ; and they brought several kinds of provisions, for which 
we satisfied them with such toys as we had ; the women also brought 
us milk and roots, and several things very acceptable to us, and all 
was quiet ; and we made us a little tent or hut of some boughs or 
trees, and lay on shore all night. 

I know not what was the occasion, but I was not so well satisfied 
to lie on shore as the rest ; and the boat riding at an anchor at about 
a stone's cast from the land, with two men in her to take care of 



322 ROBINSOH CRUSOE. 

her, I Diade one of them come on shore ; and getting some boughs of 
trees to cover us also in the boat, I spread the sail on the bottom of 
the boat and lay under the cover of the branches of the trees all nighl 
in the boat. 

About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of our men mak»- 
a terrible noise on the shore, calling out, for Grod's sake, to bring 
the boat in and come and help them, for they were all like to be 
murdered ; at the same time I heard the fire of five muskets, which 
was the number of guns they had, and that three times over ; for, it 
seems, the natives here were not so easily frightened with guns as the 
savages were in America, where I had to do with them. All this 
while i knew not what was the matter ; but rousing immediately 
from sleep with the noise, I caused the boat to be thrust in, and re- 
solved, with three fusees we had on board, to land and assist our 
men. 

We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men were In too much 
haste ; for being come to the shore, they plunged into the water, to 
get to the boat with all the expedition they could, being pursued by 
between three and four hundred men. Our men were but nine in 
all, and only five of them had fusees with them ; the rest had pistols 
and swords, indeed, but they were of small use to them. 

We took up seven of our men, and with ditficulty enough too, three 
of them being very ill wounded ; and that which was still worse was, 
that while we stood in the boat to take our men in, we were in as 
much danger as they were in on shore ; for they poured their arrows 
in upon us so thick that we were glad to barricade the side of the 
boat up with the benches, and two or three loose boards, which, to 
our great satisfaction, we had by mere accident in the boat. And 
yet, had it been daylight, they are, it seems, such exact marksmen, 
that if they could have seen but the least part of any of us, they 
would have have been sure of us. We had, by the light of the 
moon, a little sight of them, as they stood pelting us from the shore 
with darts and arrows ; and having got ready our firearms we gave 
them a volley, that we could hear, by the cries of some of them, had 
wounded several ; however, they stood thus in battle array on the 
shore till break of day, which we supposed was that they might see 
the better to take their aim at us. 

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our an- 
chor or set up our sail, because we must needs stand up in the boat, 
and they were as sure to hit us as we were to hit a bird in a tree with 
small shot. We made signals of distress to the ship, and, though she 
rode a league off, yet my nephew, the captain, hearing our firing, and 
by glasses perceiving the posture we lav in, and that we fired toward the 
shore, pretty well understood us ; and weighing anchor with all spetd, 
he stood as near the shore as he durst with the ship, and then sent an- 
other boat with ten hands in her to assist us ; but we called to 
them not to come too near, telling them what condition we were 



BOBINSON CRUSOE. 323 

in ; however, they stood in near to us, and one of the men, taking 
the end of a tow-line in his hand and keeping one boat between him 
and the enemy so that thev could not perfectly see him, swam on 
board us and made /ast the line to the boat ; upon which we slipped 
out a little cable, and leaving our anchor behind, they towed us out 
of reach of the arrows ; we all the while lying close behind the bar- 
ricade we had made. 

As soon as we were got from between the ship and the shore, tha 
we could lay her side to the shure, she ran along just by them and 
poured in a broadside among them, loaded with pieces of iron and 
lead, small bullets and such stuff, besides the great shot, which made 
a terrible havoc among them. 

When we were got on board and out of danger, we had time to 
examine into the occasion of this fray ; and, Indeed, our supercargo, 
who had l)een often in those parts, put me upon it ; for he said he 
was sure the inhabitants would not have touched us after we had a 
truce, if we had not done something to provoke them to it. At 
length it came out that an old woman, who had come to sell us some, 
milk, had brought it within our poles, and a young woman with her, 
who also brought some roots or herbs ; and while the old woman 
(whether she was mother to the young woman or no they could not 
tell) was selling us the milk, one of our men offered some rudeness to 
the wench that was with her, at which the old woman made a great 
noise ; however, the seaman would not quit his prize, but carried 
her out of the old woman's sight, among the trees, it being almost 
dark ; the old woman went away without her, and, as we may sup- 
pose, made an outcry among the people she came from ; who, upon 
notice, raised this great army upon us in three or four hours, and it 
was great odds but we had all been destroyed. 

One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him just at the 
beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent they had made ; 
the rest came off free, all but the fellow who was the occasion of all 
the mischief, who paid dear enough for his black mistress, for we 
could not hear what became of him for a great while. We lay upon 
the shore two days after, though the wind presented, and made signals 
for him, and made our boat sail up shore and down shore several 
leagues, but in vain ; so we were obliged to give him over ; and if he 
alone had suffered for it, the loss had been less. 

I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing on shore 
once more, to try if I could learn anything of him or them : it was 
the third night after the action that I had a great mind to learn, if I 
could by any means, what mischief we had done, and how the game 
stood on the Indians* side. I was careful to do it in the dark, lest we 
should be attacked again ; but I ought, indeed, to have been sure 
that the men I went with had been under my command, before I 
engaged in a thing so hazardous and mischievous as I was brought 
into by it, without design. 



324 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

We took twenty as stout fellows with us as any in tbe ship, be- 
sides the supercargo and myself, and we landed two hours before mid- 
night, at the same place where the Indians stood drawn up in tlie 
evening before. I landed here, because mv design, as T have said, 
was chiefly to see if they had quitted the fieldf, and if they had left any 
marks behind them of the mischief we had done them, and I thought 
if we could surprise one or two of them, perhaps we might get our 
man again, by way of exchange. 

We landed without any noise, and divided our men into two bod- 
ies, whereof the boatswain commanded one and I the other. We 
neither saw nor heard anybody stir when we landed ; and we 
marched up, one body at a distance from the other, to the place ; 
but at flrst could see nothing, it being very dark ; till by and by our 
boatswain, who led the first party, stumbled and fell over a dead body. 
This made them halt awhile ; for knowing by the circumstances that 
they were at the place where the Indians had stood, they waited for 
my coming ^ip there. We concluded to halt till the moon began to 
rise, which we knew would be in less than an hour, when we could 
easily discern the havoc we bad made among them. We told thirty- 
two bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not quite dead ; some 
had an arm and some a leg shot off, and one his head ; those that 
were wounded we supposed they had carried away. 

When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery of all we could 
come to the knowledge of, I resolved on going on board ; but the 
boatswain and his party sent me word that they were resolved to 
make a visit to the Indian town where these dogs, as they called 
them, dwelt, and asked me to go along with them ; and if they could 
find them, as they still fancied they should, ihey did not doubt of 
getting a good booty ; and it might be they might find Tom Jeflfiy 
tlieie ; that was the man's name we had lost. 

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well enough what 
answer to have given them ; for I should have commanded them in- 
stantly on boara, knowing it was not a hazard fit for us to nm, who 
had a ship and ship-loading in our charge, and a voyage to make 
which depended very much upon the lives of the men ; but as they 
sent me word they were resolved to go, and only asked me and my 
company to go along with them, I positively reiused it, and rose up 
(for I was sitting on the ground) in order to go to the Imat. One or 
two of the men began to importune me to go : and when I refused, 
began to grunable and say they were not under my command, and 
they would go. '* Come, Jack,** says one of the men, ** will you go 
with me? I'll go for one." Jack said he wo«!d — and then an- 
other — and, in a word, they all left me but one. whom I persuaded to 
stay, and a boy left in the boat. So the supercargo and I, with the 
third man, went back to the boat, where we told them we would stay 
for them and take care to take in as many of them as should be left ; 



ROBINSOK CRUSOE. * 325 

for I told them it was a mad thing they were going about, and sup- 
posed most of them would have the fate of Tom Jeffrj^. 

They told mc, like seamen, they would warrant if they would 
come off again, and they would take care, etc. ; so away they went. 
I entreated them to consider the ship and the voyage, that their lives 
were not their own, and lliat they were intrusted with the voyage, in 
some measure ; that if they miscarried, the ship might be lost for 
want of their help, and that they could not answer for it to God or 
man. But I might as well have talked to the mainmast of the ship : 
they were mad upon their journey ; only they gave me good words 
and begged I would not be angry ; that they did not doubt but 
they would be back again in about an hour at farthest ; for 
the Indian town, they said, was not above half a mile off, though they 
found it above two miles before they got to it. 

AVell, they all went away, and though the attempt was desperate, and 
such as none but madmen would have gone about, yet, to give them 
their due, they went about it as warily as boldly ; they were gal- 
lantly armed, for they had everv man a fusee or musket, a bayonet, 
and a pistol ; some oi them had broad cutlasses, some of them had 
hangerfj, and the boatswain and two more had poleaxes ; besides all 
which they had among them thirteen hand-grenadoes ; bolder fel- 
lows and better provided never went about any wicked work in the 
world. 

When they went out, their chief design was plunder, and they were 
in mighty hopes of finding gold there ; but a circumstance which ncme 
of them were aware of set them on fire with revenge, and made devils 
of them all. 

When they came to the few Indian houses which they thought had 
been the town, which was not above half a mile off, they were under 
a great disappointment, for there were not above twelve or thirteen 
houses ; and where the town was, or how big, they knew not. They 
consulted, therefore, what to do, and were some time before they 
could resolve ; for if they fell upon these, they must cut all their 
throats ; and it was ten to one but some of them might escape, it be- 
ing in the night, though the moon was up ; and ii one escaped he 
would run and raise all the town, so they should have a whole army 
upon them : again, on the other hand, if they went away and left 
those untouched (for the people were all asleep), they could not tell 
which way to look for the town : however, the last was the best ad- 
vice ; so they resolved to leave them and look for the town as well as 
they could. They went on a little way and found a cow tied to a 
tree ; this, they presently concluded, would be a good guide to them ; 
for, they said, the cow certainly belonged to the town before them or 
the town behind them, and if they untied her they should see which 
way she went : if she went back, they had nothmg to say to her ; 
but if she went forward, t(iey would follow her ; so they cut the cord. 
Which was made of twisted flags, and the cow went on before them, 



326 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

directly to the town ; wliicii, as they reported, consisted of above 
two hundred houses or huts, and in some of these they found several 
families living together. 

Here they found all in silence, as profoundly secure as sleep could 
make them : and first they called another council to consider what 
tliey had to do ; and, in a word, they resolved to divide themselves 
into three bodies, and so set three houses on fire in three parts of the 
town ; and as the men came out, to seize them and bind them (if any 
resisted, they need not be asked what to do then), and so .to search 
the rest of the houses for plunder : but they resolved to march 
silently first through the town and see what dimensions it was of, 
and if they might venture upon it or no. 

They did so, and desperately resolved that they would venture upon 
them : but while they were animating one another to the work, three 
of them, who were a little before the rest, called out aloud to them, 
and told them that they had found Tom Jeff ry ; they all ran up to the 
place, where they found the poor fellow hanging up naked by one 
arm, and his throat cut. There was an Indian house Just by the tree, 
where they found sixteen or seventeen of the principal Indians, who 
had been concerned in the fray with us before, and two or tJiree of 
them wounded with our shot ; and our men found they were awake 
and talking one to another in that house, but knew not their number. 

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, as be- 
fore, that they swore to one another they would be revenged, and that 
not an Indian that came into their hands should have any quarter ; 
and to work they went immediately, and yet not so madly as might be 
expected from the rage and fury they were in. Their first care was 
to get something that would soon take fire, but after a little search 
they found that would be to no purpose ; for most of the houses were 
low and thatched with flags and rushes, of which the country is full : 
so they presently made-some wildfire, as we call it, by wetting a little 
powder in the palm of their hands, and in a quarter of an hour they 
set the town on fire in four or five places, and paiticularly that house 
where the Indians were not gone to bed. 

As Boon as the fire began to blaze, the poor frightened creatures 
b^an to rush out to save their lives, but met with their fate in the 
attempt ; and especially at the door, where they drove them back, the 
boatswain himself killing one or two with his poleaxe. The house 
being large, and many in it, he did not care to go in, but called for a 
hand-grenado, and threw it among them, which at first frightened 
them, but, wlien it burst, made such havoc among them that they 
cried out in a hideous manner. In short, most of the Indians who 
were in the open part of the house were killed or hurt with the gren- 
ado, except two or three more who pressed to the door, which the 
boatswain and two more kept, with their bayonets on the muzzles of 
their pieces, and dispatched all that came^ m their way ; but there 
was another apartment in the house, where the prince or king, or 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 327 

whatever he was, and several others were ; and these were kept in till 
the house, which was by this time all in a light flame, fell in upon 
them, and they were smotliercd together. 

All this while they fired not a gun, because they would not waken 
the people faster tlian they couldmaster them ; but the fire began to 
waken them fast enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a little to- 
gether in bodies ; for the fire grew so raging, all the houses being 
made of light combustible stuff, that they could hardly bear the street 
between them ; and their business was to follow the fire, for the 
surer execution : as fast as the fire either forced the people out of 
those houses wnich were burning, or frightened them out of others, 
our people were ready at their doors to knock them on the head, still 
callins: and hallooing one to another to remember Tom Jeffry. 

While this was doinp;, I must confess I was very uneasy, and 
especially when I saw the flames of the town, which, it being night, 
seemed to be just by me. My nephew, the captain, who was roused 
by his men, seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not knowing what 
the matter was, or what danger I was in, specially hearing the guns 
too, for by this time they began to use their firearms ; a thousand 
thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and the supercargo, what 
would become of us ; and at last, though he could ill spare any more 
men, yet not knowing what exigence we might be in, he taKes an- 
other boat, and with thirteen men and himseli comes ashore to me. 

He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the boat with no 
more than two men ;*and though he was glad that we were well, yet 
he was fn the same impatience with us to know what was doing ; for 
the noise continued and the flame increased ; in short, it was next to 
an impossibility for any men in the world to restrain their curiosity 
to know what had happened, or their concern for the safely of the 
men ; in a word, the captain told me he would go and help his men, 
let what would come. I argued with him, as I did before with the 
men, the safety of the ship, the danger of the voyage, the interest of 
the owners and merchants, etc., and told him 1 and the two men 
would go and only see if we could at a distance learn what was 
likely to be the event, and come back and tell him. It was in vain to 
talk 10 my nephew, as it was to talk to the rest before ; he would go, 
he said ; and he only wished he had left but ten men in the ship, for 
he could not think of having his men lost for want of help ; he had 
rather lose the ship, the voyage, and his life, and all ; and away he went. 

I was no more able to stay behind now than I was to persuade 
them not to go : so, in short, the captain ordered two men to row 
back the pinnace and fetch twelve men more, leaving the long-boat 
at an anchor ; and that when they came back, six men should keep 
the two boats and six more come after us ; so that he left only six- 
teen men in the ship ; for the whole ship's company consisted of 
sixty flve men, whereof two were lost in the late quarrel which 
>)rought this mischief on. 



3?8 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

BeiDg now on the march, you may he sure we felt little of the 
ground we trod on ; and hcing guided hy the fiie, we kept no path, 
but went directly to the place of the flame. If the noise of the guns 
was surprising to us before, the cries of the poor people were now 
quite of another nature, and filled us with horror. I must confess I 
was never at the sacking a city or at the taking a town by storm. I 
had heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda in Ireland and killing 
man, woman, and child ; and I had read of Count Tilly sacking the 
city of Magdeboutg and cutting the throats of twenty-two thousand 
of all sexes ; but I never had an idea of the thing itself before, nor is 
it possible to describe it, or the horror that was upon our minds at 
hearing it. However, we went on, and at length came to the town, 
though there was no entering the streets of it for the fire. The first 
object we met with was the ruins of a hut or house, or rather the 
ashes of it, for the house was consumed ; and just before it, plainly 
now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay four men and thiee 
women, killed, and, as we thought, one or* two more lay in the heap 
among the fire ; in short, there were such instances of lage, altogether 
barbarous and of a fury something beyond what was human, that we 
thought it nnpossible our men could be guilty of it ; or, if they were 
tlie authors of it, we thought they ought to be every one of them put 
to the worst of deaths. But this was not all : we saw the fire in- 
creased forward, and the cry went on just as tlie fire went on ; so 
that we were in the utmost confusion. We advanced a little way 
farther, and. behold, to our astonishment, three naked women, and cry- 
ing in a most dreadful manner, came flying as if they had wings, and 
after them sixteen or seventeen men, natives, in the same tenor and 
consternation, with three of our English butchers in the rear, who, 
when they could not overtake them, fired in among them, and one 
that was killed by their shot fell down in our sight When the rest 
saw us, believing us to be their enemies, and that we would murder 
them as well as those that pursued them, they set up a most dreadful 
shriek, especially the women ; and two of them fell down, as if already 
dead, with the fright. 

My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran chill in my 
veins when I saw this ; and I believe had the three English sailors 
that pursued them come on, I had made our men kill them all ; how- 
ever, we took some means to let the poor flying creatures know that 
we would not hurt them ; and immediately they came up to us, and 
kneeling down, with their hands lifted up, made piteous lamentation 
to us to save them, which we let them know we would ; whereupon 
they crept all together in a huddle close behind us as for protection. 
1 left my men drawn up together, and charging them to hurt nobody, 
but if possible to get at some of our people and see what devil it was 
possessed them, and what they intenaed to do, and to command them 
off ; assuring them that if they staid till daylight they would have a 
hundred thousand men about their ears : I say I left them and went 



ROBINSOX CRUSOE. 829 

among those flying people, taking only two of our men with me ; 
and there was, indeed, a piteous spectacle among them. Some of 
them had their feet terribly burned with trampling and running 
through the tire ; others their hands burned ; one of the women had 
fallen down in the fire and was very much burned before she could 
get out again ; and two or three of the men had cuts in their backs 
and thighs from our men pursuing ; and another was shot through 
the body and died while I was there. 

1 would fain have learned what the orc^sion of all this was ; but I 
could not understand one word they fi; id : though by signs I per- 
ceived some of them knew not what was the occasion themselves. I 
was so terrified in my thoughts at this outrageous attempt that I 
could not stay there, but went back to my own men and resolved to 
go into the middle of the town through the fire, or whatever might be 
in the way. and put an end to it, cost what it would ; accordingly, as 
I came bjick to my men, I told them my resolution and commanded 
them to follow me, when, at the very moment, came four of our men, 
with the boatswain at their head, roving over heaps of bodies they 
had killed, all covered with hlood and dust, as if they wanted more 
people to massacre, when our men hallooed to them as loud as they 
could halloo ; and with much ado one of them made them hear, so 
that they knew who we were, and came up to us. 

As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a halloo like a shout of 
triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come ; and without 
waiting to hear me, *' Captain,*' says he, ** noble captain ! I am glad 
you are come: we- have not half done yet. Villainous, hell-hound 
dogs ! I'll kill as many of them as poor Tom has hairs upon his 
head : we have sworn to spare none of them ; we'll root out the very 
nation of them from the earth ;" and thus he ran on, out of breath, 
too, with action, and would not give us leave to speak a word. 

At last, raising my voice that I might silence him a little, "Bar- 
barous dog !" said I, ** what are you doing? I won't have one creat- 
ure touched more upon pain of death : I charge you, upon your life, 
to stop your hands and stand still here, or you are a dead man this 
minute." ** Why, sir," says he, "do yo^ know what you do, or 
what they have done ? If you want a reason for what we have done, 
come hither ;" and with that he showed me the poor feUow hanging 
with his throat cut. 

I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time would have 
been forward enough ; but I thought they had carried their rage too 
far, and remembered Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi : 
** Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce, and their wrath, for it was 
cruel." But I had now a new task upon my hands ; for when the 
men I carried with me saw the sight, as I had done, I had as much 
to do- to restrain them as I should have had with the others ; nay, my 
nephew himself fell in with them, and told me, in their hearing, that 
he was only concerned for fear of tlie men being overpowered ; and 



L 



830 ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 

as to the people, he thought not one of them ought to live ; for tbej 
had all glutted themselves with the murder of the poor man, and that 
they ought to be used like murderers. Upon these words away lan 
eight of my men, with the boatswain and nis crew, to complete their 
bloody work ; and I, seeing it quite out of my power to restrain 
them, came away pensive and sad ; for I could not bear the sight, 
much less the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell 
into their hands. 

I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo and two 
men, and with these walked back to the boat. It was a very great 
piece of JPolly in me, I confess, to venture back as it were alone ; for 
as it began now to be almost day and the alarm had run over the 
country, there 8 ood about forty men, armed with lances and bows, at 
tlie little place where the twelve or thirteen houses stood, mentioned 
before ; but by accident I missed the place and came directly to the 
sea-side ; and by the time I got to the sea-side it was broad day ; im- 
mediately I took the pinnace and went on board, and sent her back to 
assist the men in what might happen. 

I observed, about the time that I came to the boat-side, that the 
fire was pretty well out and the noise abated ; but in about half an 
hour after I got on board I heard a volley of our men's firearms 
and saw a great smoke : this, as I understood afterward, was our 
men falling upon the men, who, as I said, stood at the few houses on 
the way, of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen and set all the 
houses on fire, but did not meddle with the women or children. . 

By the time the men got to the shore again with the pinnace, our 
men begum to appear ; they came dropping in^ not in two bodies as 
they wf nt, but straggling here and there in such a manner that a 
small force of resolute men might have cut them all off. But the 
dread of them was upon the whole country ; and the men were sur- 
prised and so frightened that I believe a hundred of them would 
nave fled at the sight of but five of our men ; nor in all this terrible 
action was there a man that made any considerable defence ; they 
were so surprised between the terror of the fire and the sudden at- 
tack of our men in the dark that they knew not which way to turn 
themselves ; for if they fled one way they were met by one party, if 
back again, by another : so that they were everywhere knocked 
down ; nor did any of our men receive the least hurt, except one that 
sprained his foot and another that had one of his hands burned. 

I was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and, indeed, with 
all the men, in my mind, but with him in particular, as well for his 
acting so out of his duty^ as commander of the ship, and having the 
charge of the voyage upon him, as in his prompting rather than cool- 
ing the rage of his blind men in so bloody and cruel an enterprise. 
My nephew answered me very respectfully, but told me that when 
he saw the body of the poor seaman, whom they had murdered in so 
cruel and barbaft>us a manner, he was not master of himself, neither 



EOBINSON CRUSOE. 331 

could lie govern his passion ; he owned he should not have done so, 
as he was commander of the ship ; but as he was a man, and nature 
moved Lim, he could not bear it. As for the rest of the men, Ihey 
were not subject to me at a]], and they knew it well enough ; so they 
took no notice of my dislike. 

The next day we set sail ; so we never heard any more of it. Our 
men differed in the account of the number they had killed ; but ac- 
cording to the best of their accounts put all together, they killed or 
destroyed about one hundred and fifty people, men, women, anil 
children, and left not a house standing in the town. As for the poor 
fellow Tom Jeffry, as he was quite dead (for his throat was so cut 
that his head was half off), it would do him no service to bring him 
away ; so they only look him down from the tree, where he was 
hanging by one hand. 

However just our men thought this action, I was against them in 
it, and I always, after that time told them God would blast the voy 
age ; for I looked upon all the blood they shed that night to be mur- 
der in them. For though it is true that they had killed Tom Jeffry, 
yet Jeffry was the aggressor, had broken the truce, and had violated a 
young woman of* theirs who came down to them innocently and on 
the faith of the public capitulation. 

The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were afterward on 
board. He said it was true that we seemed -to break the truce, but 
really had not ; and that the war was begun the night before by the 
natives themselves, who had shot at us and killed one of our men 
without any just provocation ; so that as we were in a capacity to 
fight them now, we might also be in a capacity to do ourselves justice 
upon them in an extraordinary manner ; that though the poor man 
had taken a little liberty with the wench, he ought not to have been 
murdered, and that in such a villainous manner ; and that they did 
nothing but what was just, and what the laws of God allowed to be 
done to murderers. 

One would think this should have been enough to have warned us 
against going on shore among heathens and barbarians ; but it is 
impossible to make mankind wise but at their own expense, and their 
experience seems to be always of most use to them when it is dearest 
bought. 

We were now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and from thence to the 
coast of Coromandel, only to touch at Surat ; but the chief of the 
supercargo's design lay at the Bay of Bengal ; where, if he missed 
his business outward-bound, he was to go up to China and return to 
the coast as he came home. 

The first disaster that befell us was in the Gulf of Persia, where five 
of our men, venturing on shore on the Arabian side of the g^ilf, were 
surrounded by the Arabians and either all killed or carried away into 
slavery ; the rest of the boat's crew were not able to rescue them, and 
had but just time to get off their boat. I began to upbraid them with 



332 BOBINSON" CRUSOE. 

the just retribution of Heaven in this case ; but the boatswain very 
warmly told me he thought I went fartlicr in my censures thnn I 
could show any warrant for in- Scripture ; and referred to Luke 13 : 4, 
where our Saviour intimates that those men on whom the Tower 
of Siloam fell were not sinners above all the Galileans ; but that 
which put me to silence in the cose was, that not one of these live 
men who were now lost were of those who went on shore to the mas- 
sacre of Madagascar ; so I always called it, though our men could 
not bear to hear the word masMcre with any patience. 

But my frequent preaching to them on this subject had worse con- 
sequences than I expected ; and the boatswain, who had been the 
head of the attempt, came up boldly to me one time, and told me he 
found that I brought that affair continually upon the stage ; that I 
made unjust reflections upon it, audhad used the men very ill on that 
account, and himself in particular ; that as I was but a passenger and 
had no command in the ship, or concern in the voyage, they were not 
obliged to bear it ; that they did not know but I might have some ill 
design in my head, and perhaf s to call them to an account for It when 
they came to England ; and that, therefore, unless I would resolve to 
have done with it, and also not to concern myself any further with 
him, or any of his affairs, he would leave the ship ; for he did not 
think it safe to sail with me among them. 

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then told him 
that I confessed I had all along opposed the massacre of Madagascar, 
and that I had on all occasions spoken my mind freely al^ut it, 
though not more upon him than any of the rest ; that as to having 
no command in the ship, that was true ; nor did I exercise any au- 
thority, only took the liberty of speaking my mind in things which 
publicly concerned us all ; and what concern I had in the voyage 
was none of his business ; that I was a considerable owner in the 
ship. In that claim I conceived I had a right to speak even further 
than I had done, and would not be accountable to him or anyone else, 
and began to be a little warm with him. He made but little reply to 
me at that time, and I thought the affair had been over. We were at 
this time in the road at Bengal ; and being willing to see the place, I 
went on shore, with the supercargo, in the ship's boat, to divert my- 
self ; and toward evening was preparing to go on board, when one 
of the men came to me and told me he would not have me trouble 
myself to come down to the boat, for they had orders not to carry 
me on board any more. Any one may guess what a surprise I was ik 
at so insolent a message ; and I asked the man who bade him de- 
liver that message to me? He told me the coxswain. I said 
no more to the fellow, but bade him let them know he had delivered 
his message, and that I had given him no answer to it. 

I immediately went and found out the supercargo, and told him the 
story, adding, what I presently foresaw, that there would be a mutiny 
in the ship ; and entreated him to go immediately on board the ship 



ROBINSON CRUSOBw 333 

in an Indian boat and acquaint the captain of it. But I might have 
spared this intelligence, for before 1 had spoken to him on shore the 
matter was effect^ on board The boatswain, the gunner, the car- 
penter, and all the inferior officers, as soon as I was gone oif in the 
boat, came up and desired to speak with the captain ; and there the 
boatswain, making a long harangue, and repeating all he had said to 
me, told the captain, in a few words, that as I was now gone peace- 
ably on shore, they were loath to use any violence with me, which, if 
I had not gone on shore, they would otherwise have done to oblige 
me to have gone. They therefore thought fit to tell him, that as they 
shipped themselves to serve in the ship under his command, they 
would perform it well and faithfully ; but if I would not quit the 
ship, or the captain oblige me to quit it, they would all leave the ship 
and sail no farther with him ; and at that word all he turned his 
face toward the mainmast, which was, it seems, the signal agreed on 
between them, at which' the seamen, being got together there, cried 
out, *' One arid all/ one and aU/" 

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit and of great presence 
of mind ; and though he was surprised, you may be sure, at tho 
thing, yet he told them calmly that he would considfer of the matter ; 
but that be could do nothing in it till he had spoken to me about it. 
He used some arguments with them to show them the unreasonable- 
ness and Injustice of the thing : but it was f^U in vain ; they swore, 
and shook hands round before his face, that they would all go on 
shore unless he would engage to them not to suffer me to come any 
more on board the ship. 

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obligation to me, 
and did not know how I might take it ; so he began to talk smartly 
to them ; told them that I was a very considerable owner of the ship, 
and that in justice he could not put me out of my own house ; that 
this was next door to serving me as the famous pirate Kidd had done, 
who made a mutinv in the ship, set the captain on shore on an unin- 
habited island, and ran Awsy with the ship ; that let them go into 
what ship they would, if ever they came to England again, it would 
cost them very dear ; that the ship was mine, and that he could not 
put me out of it ; and that he would rather lose the ship and the voy- 
age too than disoblige me so much ; so they might do as they 
pleased. However, he would go on shore and talk with me, and in- 
vited the boatswain to go with him, and perhaps they might accommo- 
date the matter with me. But they all rejected the proposal, and said 
they would have nothing to do with me any more ; and if I came on 
board thejr would all go on shore. ** Well,'* said the captain, " if you 
are all of this mind, let me go on shore and talk with him.*' So 
away he came to me with this account, a little after the message had 
been brought to me from the coxswain. 

I v/as very glad to see my nephew, I must confess ; for I was not 
without apprehensions that they would confine him by violence, set 



334: ROBINSON CRUSOB. 

sail and run away with the ship ; and then I had been stripped 
naked in a remote country, having nothing to help myself : in short, 
I had been in a worse case than when I was alone in the island. But 
they had not come to that length, it seems, to my satisfaction ; and 
when my nephew told me what they had said to him, and how they 
had sworn and shook hands that they would, one and all, leave the 
ship if I was suffered to come on board, I tokl him he should not be 
concerned at it at all, for I would stay on shore. I only desired he 
would take care and send me all my necessary things on shore, and 
leave me a sufficient sum of money, and I would find my way to Eng- 
land as well as I cnuld^ 

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew^ but there was no 
way to help it but to comply ; so, in short, he went on board the ship 
again, and satisfied the men that his uncle had yielded to their impor- 
tunity, and had sent for his goods from on board the ship ; so that 
the matter was over in a few hours, the men returned to their duty, 
and I began to consider what course I should steer. 

I was now alone, in the most remote part of the world, as I think I 
may call it, for I was near three thousand leagues by sea farther off 
from England than I was at my island ; only, it is true, I might trav- 
el here by land over the Great Mogul's country to Surat, might go 
from thence to Bassora by sea, up the Gulf of Persia, and take the 
way of the caravans over the Desert of Arabia to Aleppo and Scan- 
deroon ; from thence by sea again to Italy, and so overland into 
France ; and this put together might at least be a full diameter of the 
globe, or more. 

I had another way before me, which was to wait for some English 
ships which were coming to Bengal from Achin, on the Island of 
Sumatra, and get passage on board them for England. But as I came 
hither without any concern with the East India Company, so it would 
be difficult to go from hence without their license, unless with great 
favor of the captains of the ships, or the company's factors ; and to 
both I was an utter stranger. 

Here I had the mortification to see the ship set sail without me ; a 
treatment I think a man in my circumstances scarcely ever met with, 
except from pirates running away with a ship, and setting those that 
would not agree with their villainy on shore Indeed, this was next 
door to it both ways ; however, my nephew left me two servants, or, 
rather, one companion and one servant; the first was -clerk to the 
])urser, whom he engaged to go with me, and the other was his own 
servant. I took me also a good lodging in the house of an English- 
woman, where several merchants lodgea, some French, two Italians, 
or rather Jews, and one Englishman. Here I was handsomely enough 
entertained ; and that I might not be said to run rashly upon anything, 
I staid here above nine months, considering what course to take, 
and how to manage myself. I had some English goods with me of 
value, and a considerable sum of money, my ncpliew. furnishing me 



EOBINSOJ^ CRUSOE. ' 335 

with a thousand pieces-of -eight, and a letter of credit for more, if I 
had occasion, that I might not be straitened, whatever might happen. 

I quickly disposed of my goods to advantage ; and, as I originally 
intended, I bought here some very good diamonds, which, of all 
other things, were the most proper for me in my present circum- 
stances, because I could always carry my whole estate about me. 

After a long stay here, and many proposals made for my return to 
England, but none falling out to my mind, the English merchant 
who lodged with me, and whom I had contracted an intimate ac- 
quaintance with, came to me one morning. ' ' Coimtryman, ' * says he, 
** I have a project to communicate to you, which, as it suits with my 
thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit with yours also when you shall 
have thoroughly considered it. Here we are posted, you by accident 
and I by my own choice, in a part of the world very remote from our 
own country ; but it is in a country where, by us, who understand 
trade and business, a great deal of money is to be got. If you will 
put one thousand pounds to my one thousand pounds, we will hire a 
ship here, the first we can get to our minds ,* you shall be captain, 
I'll be merchant, and we'll go a trading voyage to China ; for what 
should we stand still for ? The whole world is in motion, rolling 
round and round ; all the creatures of God, heavenly bodies and 
earthly, are busy and diligent ; why should we be idle ? There are 
no.drones in the world but men ; why should we be of that num- 
ber?" 

I liked this proposal very well ; and the more so because it seemed 
to be expressed with so much good will and in so friendly a manner. 
I will not say but that I might, by my loose, unhinged circiun- 
stances, be the fitter to embrace a proposal for trade, or indeed any- 
thing else ; otherwise, trade was none of my clement. However, I 
migiit perhaps say, with some truth, that if trade was not my elemcDt, 
rambling was ; and no proposal for seeing any part of the world 
which I had never seen before could possibly come amiss to me. 

It was, however, some time before we could get a ship taour 
minds, and when we hod got a vessel it was not easy to get English 
sailors ; that is to say, so many as were necessary to govern the voy- 
age and manage the sailors which we should pick up there. After 
some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a gunner, English ; a 
Dutch carpenter, and three foremast men. With these we found we 
could do well enough, having India seamen, such as there were, to 
make up. 

There are so many travellers who have written a history of their 
voyages and travels this way, that it would be very little diversion 
to anybody to give a long account of the places we went to and the 
people who inhabit there ; these things I leave to others, and refer the 
reader to those journals ai^d travels q( Englishmen, of which many I 
find are published, and more pron^sed every day ; it is enough for 
jx^e to tell yoi^ that we n^ide this voyage to Achin, in the Island oi 



L .'^: 



336 ROBIKSOK CRUSOE. 

Sumatra, and from thence to Siam, where we exchanged some of our 
wares for opium and some arrack ; the first a commodity which 
hears a great price among the Chinese, and which, at that time, was 
much wanted there. In a word, we went up to Suskan, made a very 
great voyage, were eight months out, and returned to Bengal ; and I 
was very well satisfied with my adventure. I observe that our peo- 
ple in Enghmd often admire how oflScers, which the Company send 
mto India, and the merchants which generally stay there, get such very 
great estates as they do, and sometimes come home worth sixty or 
seventy thousand pounds at a time ; but it is no wonder, or at least 
we shall see so much farther into it when we consider the innumera- 
ble ports and places where they have a free commerce, that it will be 
none ; and much less it will be so when we consider that at those 
places and ports where the English ships come, there is such great 
and constant demand for the growth of all other countries, that 
there is a certain vent for the returns, as well as a market abroad 
for the goods carried out. 

In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so much money 
by my first adventure, and such an insight into the method of getting 
more, that had I been twenty years younger I should have been 
tempted to have staid here and sought no farther for making any for- 
tune ; but what was all this to a man upward of threescore, that 
was rich enough, and came abroad more in obedience to a restless 
desire of seeing the woild than a covetous desire of g^uning by it ? 
And, indeed, ithink it is with great justice I now call it restless de- 
sire, for it was so. When I was at home I was restless to go 
abroad ; and when I was abroad I was restless to be at home. I say, 
what was this ^in to me ? I was rich enough already, nor had I any 
uneasy desires about getting more money ; and therefore the profit of 
the voyage to me was of no great force for the prompting me for- 
ward to further undertakings : hence, I thought that by this vojra^ 
I had made no progress at all, because I was come back, as I might 
call it, to the place from whence I came as to a home ; whereas my 
eye, like that which Solomon speaks of, was never satisfied with see- 
ing. I was come into a part of the world which I was never in be- 
fore, and that part, in particular, which I had heard much of, and 
was resolved to see as much of it as I could : and then I thought I 
might say I had seen all the world that was worth seeing. 

But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions : I do not name 
tliis to insist on my own, for I acknowledge his were the most just 
and the more suited to the end of a merchant's life, who, when he is 
abroad upon adventures, is wise to stick to that as the best thing for 
him which he is likely to get the most money bv. My new friend 
kept himself to the nature of the Ihiug, ami would have been content 
to have gone like a carrier's horse, always to the same inn, backwaid 
and forward, provided he could, as he called it, find his account in it. 
On the other hand, mine was the notion of amad, rambling boy, that 



BOBINSOK CRUSOE. 337 

never cares to see a thing twipe over. But this was not all : I had a 
kind of impatience upon me to be nearer home, and yet the most un- 
settletl resolution imaginable which way to go. In tlie interval of 
these consultations, my friend, who was always upon the search for 
business, proposed another voyage to me among the Spice Islands, 
and to bring home a loading of cloves from the Manillas or there- 
about ; places, indeed, where the Dutch trade, but islands belonging 
partly to the Spaniards ; though we went not so far but to some 
other, where they have not the whole power, as they have at Batavia, 
Ceylon, etc. 

tVe were not long in preparing for this voyage ; the chief difficulty 
was in bringmg me to come into it : however, at last, nothing else 
offering, and finding that really stirring about and trading, the profit 
being so great, and, as I may say, certain, had more pleasure in it, 
and had more satisfaction to my mind than sitting still, which to me 
especially was the unhappiest part of life, I resolved on this voy- 
age too, which we made very successfully, touching at Borneo, and 
several islands whose names I do not remember, and came home in 
about five months. We sold our spice, which was chiefly cloves and 
nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who carried them away to the 
gulf ; and making near five of one, we really got a great deal of 
money. 

My friend, when he made up this account, smiled at me. " "Well, 
now,*' said he, with a sort of agreeable insult upon mv indolent tem- 
per, '* is not this better than walking about here like a man with 
notliing to do, and spending our time in staring at the nonsense and 
ignorance of the pagans?" '* Why, truly," says I, ** niy friend, I 
think it is, and I begin to be a convert to the principles of merchan- 
dising ; but I must tell you," said I, ** by the way, you do not know 
what I am doing ; for if I once conquer my backwardness and em- 
l)ark heartily, as old as I am, I shall harass you up and down the world 
till I tire you ; for I shall pursue it so eagerly I shall never let you 
lie still." 

But, to be short with my speculations, a little while after this there 
came in a Dutch ship from Batavia ; she was a coaster, not a Euro- 
pean trader, of about two hundred tons burden ; the men, as they 
pretended, having been so sickly that the captain had not hands 
enough to go to sea with, he lay bv at Bengal ; and having, it seems, 
got money enough, or being willing, for other reasons, to go to 
Europe, he gave public notice he would sell his ship. This came to 
my ears before my new partner heard of it, aiid I had a great mind to 
buy it ; so I w^nt to him and told him of it. He considered awhile, 
for he was no rash man neither ; but musing some time he replied, 
'* She is a little too big ; but, however, we will have her. " Accord- 
ingly we bought the ship, and agreeing with the master, we paid for 
her and took possession. When we had done so, we resolved to 
engage the men if we could, to join with those we had for the porsu- 



838 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

ing our business ; but, on a sudden, tbcy having received not their 
wages, but their share of the money, as we afterward learned, not 
one of tbem was to i)e found : we inquired much about Ihem, and at 
length were told that they were all gone together by land to Agra, 
the great city of the Mogul's residence, and from thence to travel to 
Surat, and go by the sea to the Gulf of Persia. 

Nothing had so much troubled me a good while as that I should 
miss the opportunity of going with them ; for such a ramble, I thought, 
and in such company as would both have guarded and diverted 
me, would have suited mightily with my great design ; and I should 
have both seen the world and gone homeward too : but 1 was much 
better satisfied a few days after, when I came to know what sort of 
fellows they were ; for, in short, their history was (hat this man they 
called captain was the gunner only, not the commander ; that they 
had been a trading voyage, in which they had been attacked on shore 
by some of the Malays, who had killed the captain and three of his 
men ; and that, after the captain was killed, these men, eleven in 
number, had resolved to run away with the ship, which they did, and 
brought her to Bengal, leaving the mate and five men more on shore. 

Well, let them get the ship how they would, we came honestly by 
her, as we thought, though we did not, I confess, examine into things 
so exactly as we ought ; for we never inquired anything of the sea- 
men, who would certainly have faltered in their account, contra- 
dicted one another, and perhaps contradicted themselves ; somehow 
or other we should have had reason to have suspected them ; but the 
man showed us a bill of sale for the ship to one Emanuel Closter- 
shoven, or some such name, for I suppose it was all a forgery, and 
called himself by that name, and we could not contradict him : and 
withal, having no suspicion of the thing, we went through with our 
bargain. 

We picked up some more English sailors here after this, and some 
Dutch ; and now we resolved on a second voyage to the south-east 
for cloves, etc. ; that is to say, among the Philippine and Molucca 
Isles ; and, in short, not to fill up this part of my story with trifles, 
when what is to come is so remarkable, I spent, from first to last, six 
years in this country, trading from port to port, backward and for- 
ward, and with very good success, and was now the last year with 
my new partner, going in the ship above mentioned, on a voyage to 
China, but designing first to go to Slam to buy rice. 

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged t6 beat yp and 
down a great while in the Straits of Malacca, and among the islands, 
we were no sooner got clear of those difilcult seas than we found our 
ship had sprung a leak, and we were not able, by all our industry, to 
find out where it was. This forced us to make some port, and my 
partner, who knew the country better than I did, directed the captain 
to put into the River of Cambodia ; for I had made the English mate, 
one Mr. Thompson, captain, not being willing to take the char|i;e of 



I^OBIKSOiq' CRUSOE. 339 

Clie ship upon myself. This river lies on tha north side of the great 
bay or gulf which goes up to Siani. While we were here, and coing 
often on shore for refreshment, there comes to me one day an Eng- 
lishman ; and he was, it seems, a gunner's mate on board an English 
East India ship, which rode in the same river at or near the city of 
Cambodia. What brought him hither we knew not ; but he comes 
to me, and, speaking English, ** Sir,*' says he, " you are a stranger to 
me, and I to you ; but I have something to tell you that very nearly 
concerns you." 

I looked steadfastly at him a gOod while, and thought at first I had 
known him ; but 1 did not. '* If it very nearly concerns me," said I, 
* • and not yoursd t, what moves you to tell i t to me V" * * I am moved, ' ' 
sayshCy " by the imminent danger you are in, and, for aught 1 see, you 
have no knowledge of it. " ** I know no danger I am in, " says I, *' but 
that my ship is leaky, and I cannot find it out ; but I intend to lay her 
aground to morrow, to see if I can find it." *'But, sir," says he, 
** leaky or not leaky, find it, or not find it, you will be wiser than to 
lay your ship on shore to-morrow when you hear what I have to say 
to you. Do you know, sir," said he, ** the town of Cambodia lies 
about fifteen leagues up this river ; and there are two large English 
ships about five leagues on this side, and three Dutch ?" ** Well," 
said I, " and what is that to me ? * ** Why, sir," said he, " is it for 
a man that is upon such adventures as you are, to come into a port 
and not examine first what ships there are there, and whether he is 
able to deal with them ? I suppose you do not think you are a match 
for them?" I was amused very much at his discourse, but not 
amazed at it, for I could not conceive what he meant ; and I turned 
short upon him and said, ** Sir, I wish you would explain yourself ; 
I cannot imagine what reason I have to be afraid of any of the Com- 
pany's ships, or Dutch ships. I am no interloper. What can they 
have to say to me?" He looked like a man half angry and half 
pleased, and pausing awhile, but smiling, *' Well, sir," savs he, *' if 
you think yourself secure, you must take your chance ; I am sorry 
your fate should blind you against good advice ; but assure yourself, 
if you do not put to sea immediately, you will the very next tide be 
attacked by five lon^-boals full of men, and perhaps, if you are taken, 
you will be hanged for a pirate, and the particulars be examined af- 
terward. I thought, sir," added he, "I should have met with a 
better reception than this, for doing you a piece of service of such 
importance." ** I can never be ungrateful," said I, *' for any service 
or to any man that offers me any kindness ; but it is past my compre- 
hension what they should have such a design upon me for ; however, 
since yoti say there is no time to be lost, and that there is some vil- 
laii^ous design on hand against me, I will go on board this minute 
and put to sea immediately, if my men can stop the leak, or if we can 
swim without stopping it ; but, sir," said I, '* shall I go away igno- 
rant of the cause of all this ? Can you give me no further light into 



340 KOBINSOK CRUSOE. 

it?" " I can teU you but part of the story, sir,*' says he ; ** but 1 
have a Dutch seaman here with me, and I believe I could persuade 
him to tell you the rest ; but there is scarce time for it ; but the short 
of the story is this, the first part of which 1 suppose you know well 
enough, that you were with this ship at Sumatra, that there your 
captnm was murdered by the Malays, with three of his men, ami that 
you, or some of those that were on board with you, ran away with tlie 
ship and are since turned pirates. This is the sum of the story, and 
you will all be seized as pirates, I can assure you, and executed with 
very little ceremony ; for you know merchant ships show but little 
law to pirates if they get them into their power.*' ** Now you 
speak plain English,** said I, ** and 1 thank you ; and though I know 
nothing that we have done like what you talk of — for I am sure we 
came honestly and fairly by the ship — yet seeing such a work is do- 
ing, as you say, and that you seem to mean honestl3% I will be upon 
my guard.** *' Nay, sir,** says he, '* do not talk of being upon your 
guard ; the best defence is to be qut of the danger. • If you have any 
regaixi for your life and the lives of all your men, put to sea without 
fail at high water ; and as you have a whole tide before you, you 
will be gone too far out before they can come down ; for they will 
come away at high water, and as they have twenty miles to come, 
you will get near two hours of them by the difference of the tide, not 
reckoning the length of the way ; l^esides, as they are only boats and 
not ships, they will not venture to follow you far out to sea, espe- 
cially if it blows.** "Well,** said I, *'you have been very kind in 
this : what shall I do for j'ou to make you amends ?** " Sir/' says 
he, '* you may not be willing to make me any amends, because you 
may not be convinced of the truth of it. I will make an offer to 

you : 1 have nineteen months* pay due to me on board the ship , 

which I came out of England in, and the Dutchman that is with me 
has seven months* pay due to him. If you will make good our pay 
to us, we will go along witli you ; if you find nothing more in it we 
will desire no more ; but if we do convince you that we have saved 
your lives, and the ship, and the lives of all the men in her, we will 
leave the rest to you.*' 

I consented to this readily, and went immediately on board, and 
the two men with me. As soon as I came to the ship*s side, my 
partner, who was on board, came out on the quarter-deck, and called 
to me with a great deal of joy, *' O ho 1 O ho ! we have stopped the 
leak ! we have stopped the leak !" ** Say you so ?*' said I, ** thank 
God ! but weigh anchor then immediately.** *' Weigh !'* says he ; 
**what do you mean by that? What is the matter?** *' Ask no 
questions,** said I ; *' but all hands to work and weigh without los- 
inti^ a minute.** He was surprised ; but, however, he called the cap- 
tain, >ind he immediately ordered the anchor to be got up ; and 
though the tide was not quite down, yet a little land l>ro( zo 
blowmg, we stood out to sea. Then I called him into the cabin 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 34:1 

and told him the story, and we called in the men, and they told us the 
rest of it ; but as it took up a sreat deal of time before we had done, 
a seaman comes to the cabin door and called out to us that the cap- 
tain bade him tell us we were chased. ** Chased," savs I ; ** bv 
what ?*' *' By five sloops or boats,** says the fellow, " full of men. 
** Very well,* said I, ** then it is apparent there is something in it.'* 
In the next place I ordered all our men to be called up, and told 
them there was a de«gn to seize the ship, and to take us for pirates, 
and asked them if they would stand by us, and by pne another ; the 
men answered cheerfully, one and all, tliat they would live and die 
with us. Then I asked the captain what way he thought best for us to 
manage a fight with them ; for resist them I was resolved we would,- 
and that to the last drop. He said readily that the way was to keep 
them off with our great shot as long as we could, and then to firq at 
them with our small-arms, to keep them from boarding us : but when 
neither of these would do any longer, we would retire to our close 
quarters ; perhaps they had not materials to break open our bulk- 
heads, or get in upon us. 

The gunn'br had in the mean time orders to bring two guns to bear 
fore and aft, out of the steerage, to clear the deck, and load them 
with musket bullets and small pieces of old iron and what came next 
to hand ; and thUs we made ready for fight : but all this while we 
kept out to sea with wind enough, and could see the boats at a dis- 
tance, being five large long-boats, following us with all the sail tb(*y 
could make. 

Two of those boats (which by our glasses we could see were Eng- 
lish) outsailed the rest, were near two leagues ahead of them, and 
gained upon us considerably, so that we found they would come up 
with us ; upon which we fired a gun without b^l, to intimate that 
they should bring to : and we put out a flag of truce, as a signal for 
parley ; but they came crowding after us, till they came within shot, 
when we took in our white flag, they having made no answer to it, 
and hung out a red flag, and fired at them with a shot. Notwith- 
standing this, they came on till they were near enough to call to them 
with a speaking-trumpet which we had on board ; so we called to 
them, and bade them keep off at their peril. 

It was all one ; they crowded after us, and endeavored to come 
under our stern, so as to board us on our quarter ; upon which, see- 
ing they were resolute for mischief, and depended upon the strength 
that followed them, I ordered to bring the ship to, so that they lay 
upon our broadside ; when immediately we fired five guns at iheni, 
one of which had been levelled so true as to carry away the stern of 
the hindermost boal, and bring them to the necessity of taking down 
their sail, and running all to tbe head of the boat, to keep her from 
sinking ; so she lay by, and had enough of it ; but seeing the fore- 
most Iwat crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her m particu- 
lar. . While this was doing, one of the three boats that was behind, 



342 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

being forwarder than the other two, made up to the boat which we 
had disabled, to relieve her, and we could see her take oul the men : 
we called again to the foremost boat and offered a truce to parley 
again, and to know what her business was with us ; but had no an- 
swer, only she crowded close under our stern. Upon this, our gun- 
ner, who was a very dexterous fellow, ran out his two chase guns, 
and fired again at her ; but the shot missing, the men in the boat 
shouted, waved their caps, and came on ; but the gunner getting 
quickly ready a^ain, fired among them a second time, one shot of 
which, though it missed the boat itself, yet fell in among the men, 
and we could easily see had done a great deal of mischief among 
them ; but we took no notice of that, wore the ship again, and 
brought our quarter to bear upon them, and firing three guns more, 
we found the boat was almost split to pieces ; in particular, her rud- 
der and a piece of her stem were shot quite away ; so they handed 
her sail immediately, and were in great disorder. But, lo complete 
their misfortune, our gunner let fly two guns at them again ; whenj 
he hit them we could not tell, but we found the boat was sinking, 
and some of the men already in the water : upon this, I immediately 
manned out our pinnace, which we kept close by our side, with 
orders to pick up some of the men, if they could, and save them 
from drowning, and immediately come on board ship with them, be- 
cause w<e saw the rest of the boats began to come up. Our men In 
the pinnace followed their orders, and took up three men, one of 
whom was just drowning, and it was a good while before we could 
recover him. As soon as they were on board, we crowded all the 
sail we could make, and stood farther out to sea ; and we found that 
when the other three boats came up to the first they gave over their 
chase 

Being thus delivered from a danger, which, though I knew not the 
reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater than I apprehended. I 
resolved that we should change our course, and not let any * one 
know whither we were going : so we stood out to sea eastward, quite 
out of the course of all European ships, whether they were bound to 
China or an3rwhere else, within the commerce oi the European 
nations. 

When we were at sea, we began to consult With the two seamen, 
and inquire what the meaning xTf all this should be ; and the Dutch- 
man let us into the secret at once, telling us that the fellow that sold 
us the ship, as we said, was no more than a thief that had run away 
with her. Then he told us that the captain, whose name too he told 
us, though 1 do not remember it now, was treacherously murdered by 
the natives on the coast of Malacca, with three of his men, and 
that he, this Dutchman, and fuur more, got into the woods, 
where they wandered about a great while, till at length he, in 
particular, in a miraculous manner, made his escape, and swam off 
to a Dutch ship, which, sailmg near the shore in its way from China. 



EOBINSOK CRUSOE. 343 

had sent their boat on shore for fresh water ; that he durst pot come 
to Ihat part of Ihe shore where the boat was, but made shift in the 
Bight to take the water farther off, and, swimming a great while, at 
last the ship's boat took him up. 

'He then told us that he went to Batavia, where two of the seamen 
belonging u> the ship arrived, having deserted the rest in their trav- 
els, and gave an account that the fellow who had run away with the 
ship sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, who were gone a-cruising 
in her, and that they had already taken an English ship and two 
Dutch ships very richly laden. 

This latter part we found to concern us directly, though we knew 
it to be false ; yet, as my partner said, very justly, if we had fallen 
into their hands, and they had had such a prepossession against us 
beforehand, it had been in vain for us to have defended ourselves, or 
to hope for any good quarter at their hands — and especially consider- 
ing that our accusers had been our judges, and that we could have 
expected nothing from them but what rage would have dictated, and 
an ungovemed passion have executed ; and therefore it was his opin* 
ion we should go directly back to Bengal, from whence we came, 
without putting in at any port whatever — because there we could 
give a good account of ourselves, could prove where we were when 
the ship put in, of whom we bought her, and the like ; and, what 
was more than all the rest, if we were put upon the necessity of 
bringing it before the proper judges, we should be sure to have some 
justice, and not to be hanged first and judged afterward. 

I was some time of my partner's opinion ; but after a little more se- 
rious thinking I told him I thought it was a very great hazard for us to 
attempt returning to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong side of the 
Straits of Malacca, and that if the alarm was given, we should be 
sure to be waylaid on every side, as well by the Dutch at Batavia as 
the English elsewhere ; that if we should be taken as it were running 
away, we should even condemn ourselves, and there would want no 
more evidence to destroy us. I also asked the English sailor's opin- 
ion, who said he was of my mind, and that we £ould certainly be 
taken. This danger a little startled my partner and all the ship's 
company, and we immediately resolved to go away to the coast of 
Tonquin, and so on to the coast of China, and, pursuing the first de- 
sign as to trade, find some way or other to dispose of the ship, and 
come back in some of the vessels of the country, such as we could 
get. This was approved of ^ the best method for our security ; and 
accordingly we steered away N.N.E., keeping above fifty leagues oflf 
from the usual course to the eastward. This, however, put us to 
some inconvenience, for, first the winds, when we came that distance 
from the shore, seemed to be more steadily against us. blowing almost 
trade, as we call it, from the E. and E.N.E., so that we were a 
long while upon our voyage, and we were but ill provided with vict- 
uals for 80 long a run ; and what was still worse, there was Bom$ 



844 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

danger that those English and Dutch ship, whose boats pursued us, 
whereof some were bound that way, might have got in before us, 
and if not, some other ship bound to China might have information 
of us from them, and pursue us with the same vigor. 

I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought myself, includ- 
ing the Jate escape from the long-boats, to have been in the most dan- 
gerous condition that ever I was in through my past life ; for what- 
ever ill circumstances I had been in, I was never pursued for a thief 
before ; nor had I ever done anything that merited the name of dis- 
honest or fraudulent, much less thievish ; I had chiefly been my own 
enemy, or, as I may rightly say, 1 had been nobody's enemy but my 
own ; but now I was embarrassed in the worst condition imaginable ; 
for though I was perfectly innocent, I was in no condition to make 
that innocence appear ; and if I had been taken, it had been under a 
supposed guilt of the worst kind. This made me very anxious to 
make an escape, though which way to do it I knew not, or what port 
or place we could go to. My partner, seeing me thus dejected, 
tliough he was the most concerned at first, began to encourage me, 
and, describing to me the several parts of that coast, told me he would 
put in on the coast of Cochin China, or the Bay of Tonquin, intending 
afterward to go to Macao, a town once in possession of the Portu- 
guese, and where still a great many European families resided; 
and particularly the missionary priests usually went thither in order 
to their going forward to China. 

Hither then we resolved to go ; and, accordingly, though after a te- 
dious and irregular course, and very much straitened for provisions, we 
came within sight of the coast very early in the morning ; and upon re- 
flection on the past circumstances we were in, and the danger if we had 
not escaped, we resolved to put into a small river, which, however, 
had depth enough of water for us, and to see if we could, either over 
land or by the ship's pinnace, come to know what ships were in any 
port thereabout. This happy step was, indeed, our deliverance ; for 
though we did not immediately see any European ships in the Bay of 
Tonquin, yet the next morning there came into the bay two Dutch 
ships ; and a third, fvithout any colors spread out, but which we be- 
lieved to be a Dutchman, passed by at about two leagues' distance, 
steering for the coast of China, and in the afternoon went by two 
English ships steering the same course ; and thus we thought we saw 
ourselves beset with enemies both one way and the other. The 
place we were in was wild and barbarous — ^the* people thieves, even 
by occupation or profession ; and though, it is true, we had not 
much to seek of them, and, except getting a few provisions, cared not 
how little we had to do with them, yet it was with much difficulty 
that we kept ourselves from being insulted by them several ways. 
We were in a small river of this country, withm a few leagues of its 
utmost limits northward ; and by our boat we coasted north-east, to 
the point of land which* opens the great Bay of Tonquin ; and it was 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 345 

in this beating up along the shore that we discovered we were sur- 
rounded with enemies. The people we were among were the most 
barbarous of all the inhabitants of the coast, having no correspond- 
ence with any other nation, and dealing only in fish and oil, and such 
gross commodities ; and it may be particularly seen that they are the 
most barbarous of any of the inhabitants. Among other customs, 
they have this one — that if any vessel has the misfortune to be ship- 
wrecked upon their coast, they presently make the men all prisoners 
or slaves ; and it was not long before we found a piece of their kind- 
ness this way, on the occasion following. 

I have observed above, that our ship sprung a leak at sea, and that 
we could not find it out ; and it happened that, as I have said, it wus 
stopped unexpectedly, in the happy minute of our being to be seized 
by the Dutch and English ships in the Bay of Siam ; vet, as we did 
not find the ship so perfectly tight and sound as we desired, we re- 
solved, while we were at this place, to lay her on shore, and take oat 
what heavy things we had on board, and clean her bottom, and, if 
possible, to find out where the leaks were. Accordingly, having 
lightened the ship, and brought all our guns and other movables to 
one side, we tried to bring her down, that we might come at her bot- 
tom ; but, on second thoughts, we did not care to lay her on dry 
ground, neither could we find out a proper place for it. 

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with such a sight, 
came wondering down the shore to look at us ; and seeing the ship lie 
down on one side in such a manuer, and heeling in toward the shore, 
and not seeing our men, who were at work on her bottom with 
stages, and with their boats on the off-side, they presently concluded 
that the ship was cast away, and lay fast on the ground. On this 
supposition, they all came about us, m two or three hours' time, with 
ten or twelve lar^ boats, having some of them eight, some ten men 
in a boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on Ix^rd and plundered 
the ship, and if they found us there, to have carried us away for 
slaves to their king, or whatever they call him, for we knew nothing 
of their governor. 

When they came up to the ship, and began to row round her, they 
discovered us all liard at work on the outside of the ship's bottom and 
side, washing, and graving, and stopping, as every seafaring man 
knows how. Tbey stood for a while ^ziog at us, and we, who were 
a little surprised, could not imagine what their design was ; but being 
willing to be sure, we took this opportunity to get some of us into the 
ship, and others to hand down arms and ammunition to those that 
were at work, to defend themselves with, if there should be occa- 
sion ; and it was no more than need, for in less than a quarter of an 
hour's consultation, they agreed, it seems, that the ship was really a 
wreck, and that we were all at work endeavoring to save her, or to 
save our lives by the help of our boats ; and when we handed our 
arms into the boat, they concluded, by that motion, that we were en- 



346 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

deavoring to save some of our goods : upon this, they took it for 
granted we all belonged to them ; and away they came directly upon 
our men, as if it had been in a line of battle. 

Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be frightened, for we 
lay but in an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us to know what 
they should do. I immediately called to the men that worked upon 
the stages to slip them down, and get up the side into the ship, and 
bade those in the boat to row round and come on board ; and the ftw 
who were on board worked with all the strength and hands we had 
to bring the ship to rights ; but, however, neither the men upon the 
stages nor those in the boats could do as they were ordered, before 
the Cochin Chinese were upon them ; and two of their boats boarded 
our long-boat, and began to lay hold of the men as their prisoners. 

The first man they laid hold of was an English seaman, a stout, 
strong fellow, who, having a musket in his hand, never offered lo 
fire it, but laid it down in the boat, like a fool, as I thought ; but he 
understood his business better than I could teach him, for he grap- 
pled the pagan and dragged him by main force out of their boat into 
ours, where, taking him by the ears, he beat his head so against the 
boat's gunnel that the fellow died in his hands ; and, in ihe mean 
time, a Dutchman, who stood next, took up the musket, and with 
the butt-end of it so laid about him that he knocked down five of 
them who attempted to enter the boat. But this was doing little 
toward resisting thirty or forty men, who, fearless because ignorant 
of their danger, began to throw themselves into the loDg-i)oat" where 
we had but five men in all to defend it ; but the following accident, 
which deserved our laughter, gave our men a complete victory. 

Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of the ship, as 
well as to pay the seams where he had calked her to stop the leaks, 
had got two kettles just let down into the boat, one filled with boiling 
pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and oil, and such stuff as the 
shipwrights use for that work ; and the man that attended the car- 
penter bad a great iron ladle in his hand, with which he supplied the 
men that were at work with the hot stuff. Two of the enemy's men 
entered the boat just where this fellow stood, being in the fore- 
sheets ; he immediately saluted them with a ladleful of the stuff, boil- 
ing hot, which so burned and scalded them, being half naked, that 
they roared out like bulls, and, enraged with the fire, leaped both 
into the sea. The carpenter saw it, and cried out, *' Well done, Jack ! 
give them some more of it ;'* and stepping forward himself- takes 
one of the mops, and dipping it in the pitch-pot, he and his man 
threw it among them so plentifully that, m short, of all the men in 
the three boats, there was not one that escaped being scalded and 
burned with it, in a most frightful, pitiful manner, and made such a 
howling and crying that I never heard a worse noise ; for it is worth 
observing, that though pain naturally makes all people cry out, yet 
every nation has a particular way of exclamation, and makes a noise 




ROBINSON CRUSOE. 347 

as different one from another as their speech. I cannot give the noise 
these creatures made a better name than howling, nor a name more 
proper to the tone of it ; for I never heard anything more like the 
noise of the wolves, which, as I have said, I heard howl in the forest 
on the frontiers of Languedoc. 

I was never better pleased with a victory in my life ; not only as it 
was a perfect surprise to me, and that our danger was immhient be- 
fore, but as we got this victory without any bloodshed, except ot 
that man the fellow killed with his naked hands,' and which I was 
very much concerned at ; for I was sick of killing such poor savage 
wretches, even though it. was in my own defence, knowing they came 
on errands which they thought just, and knew no better ; and that, 
though it may be a just thing, because necessary (for there is no 
necessary wickedness in nature), yet I thought it was a sad life, when 
we must be always obliged to be killing our fellow-creatures to pre- 
serve ourselves ; and, indeed, I think so still ; and I would even now 
suffer a great deal rather than I would take away Uie life even of the 
worst person injuring me ; and I believe all considering people who 
know the value of life would be of my opinion, if they entered seri- 
ously into the consideration of it. 

But to return to my story : All the while this was doing, mv part- 
ner and I, who managed the rest of the men on board, had with great 
dexterity brought the ship almost to rights, and having got the guns 
into their places again, the gunner called to me to bid our boat get 
out of the way, for he would let fly among them. I called back 
again to him, and bade him not offer to fire, for the carpenter would 
do the work without him ; but bade him heat another pitch-kettle, 
which our cook, who was on board, tQok care of ; but the enemy 
was so terrified with what they had met with in their first attack 
that they would not come on again ; and some of them, who were 
farthest off, seeing the ship swim, as it were, upright, began, as we 
suppose, to see their mistake, and gave over the enterprise, finding it 
was not as they expected. Thus we got clear of this merry tiglit ; 
and having got some rice and some roots and bread, with about 
sixteen hogs, on board, two days before, we resolved to stay here no 
longer, but go forward, whatever came of it ; for w^e made no doubt 
but we should be surrounded the next day with rogues enough, per- 
haps more than our pitch-kettle would dispose of for us. We there- 
fore got all our things on board the same evening, and the next morn- 
ing were ready to sail : in the mean lime, lying at anchor at some 
distance from the shore, we were not so much concerned, being now 
in a fighting posture, as well as in a sailing posture, if any enemy 
had presented. The pext day, having finished our work within 
boards and finding our ship was perfectly healed of all her leaks, we 
set sail. We would have gone into the Bay of Tonquin, for we 
wanted to inform ourselves of what was to be known concerning the 
Dutch ships that had been there ; but we durst not stand in there,. 



348 ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 

because we had seen several^ships go in, as we su|>posed, but a little 
before ; so we kept on N.E.. toward the Island of Ponnosa, as much 
afraid of being seen by a Dutch or English merchant ship, as a Dutch 
or English merchant ship in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine mao- 
of-war. 

When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N.E., as if we would 
go to the Manillas or the Philippine Islands ; and this we did that we 
might not fall into the way of any of the European ships ; and then 
we steered north, till we came to the latitude of 23 degrees 80 
minutes, by which means we made the Island of Formosa directly, 
where we came to an anchor, in order to get water and fresh pro- 
visions, which the people there, who are very courteous and civil in 
their manners, supplied us with willingly, and dealt very fairly and 
punctual}}' with us in all their agreements and bargains ; which is 
what we did not find amon^ other people, and may be owing to the 
remains of Christianity which was once planted here by a Dutch 
missionary of Protestants, and is a testimony of what I have often 
observed, viz., that the Christian religion always civilizes the people 
and reforms their manners, where it is received, whether it works 
saving effects upon them or no. 

From thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of China at an 
equal distance, till we knew we were beyond all the ports of China 
where our European ships usually come ; being resolved, if possible, 
not to fall into any of their hands, especially in this country ; where, 
as our circumstances were, we could not fail of being entirely ruined. 

Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we resolved to put 
into the first trading port we should come at ; and standing in for the 
shore, a boat came off two leagues to us with an old Portuguese 
pilot on board, who, knowing us to be a European ship, came to offer 
his service, which, indeed, we were glad of,.and took him on board ; 
upon whicli, without asking us v« hither we would go, he dismissed 
the boat he came in, and sent it back. 

I thought it was now so much in our choice to make the old man 
carry us whither we would, that I be^an to talk to him about carry- 
ing us to the Gulf of Nanquin, which is the most northern part of the 
coast of China. The old man said he knew the Gulf of Nanquin 
very well ; but, smiling, asked us what we would do there ? I told 
him we would sell our cargo and purchase China wares, calicoes, raw 
silks, tea, wrought silks, etc. ; and so would return by the same 
course we came. He told us our best port would have been to put in 
at Macao, where we could not have failed of a market for our opium 
to our satisfaction, and might for our money have purchased all sorts ' 
of China goods as cheap as we could at Nanquin. 

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, of which he was 
very opinionated or conceited, I told him we were gentlemen as well 
as merchants, and that we had a mind to go and see the great city of 
Pekin, and the famous court of the monarch of China. ** Why, 



J

then," says the old man, ** you should go to Ningpo, where, by the 
river fhich runs into the sea there, you may go up within five 
leagues of the great canal. This canal is a navigable stream, which 
goes through the heart of that vast empire of China, crosses all the 
rivers, passes some considerable hills by the help of sluices and gates, 
and goes up to the city of Pekin, being in length near two hundred 
and seventy leagues. 

•* Well,' said I, ** Seignior Portuguese, but that is not our business 
now ; the great question is, if you can carry us up to the city of 
!Nanquin, from whence we can travel to Pekin afterward?" He 
said he could do so very well, and that there was a great Dutch ship 
gone up that way just l)efore. This gave me a little shock, for a 
Dutch ship was now our terror, and we had much rather have met 
the devil, at least if he had not come in too frightful a figure ; and 
we depended upon it that a Dutch ship would be our destruction, for 
we were in no condition to fight them ; all the ships they trade with 
into those parts being of great burden, and of much greater force 
than we were. 

The old man found me a little confused, and under some concern, 
when he named a Dutch ship, and said to me, ** Sir, you need be uu- 
der no apprehensions of the Dutch ; I suppose they are not now at 
war with your nation ?" ** No," said 1, ** that's true ; but I know 
not what liberties men may take when they are out of the reach of 
the laws of their own country." ** Why," says he, "you are no 
pu*ates ; what need you fear ? They will not meddle with peaceable 
merchants, sure." 

If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up into my face at 
that word, it was hindered by some stop in the vessels appointed by 
nature to circulate it, for it put me into the greatest disorder and 
confusion imaginable ; nor was it possible for me to conceal it so ; 
but the old man easily perceived it. 

** Sir," says he, " I find you are in some disorder in your thoughts 
at nay talk ; pray be pleased to go which way you think fit, and, de- 
pend upon it, 1*11 do you all the service I can." " Why, seignior," 
surd I, ''it is true I am a little unsettled in my resolution, at this time, 
whither to go in particular ; and I am something more so for what 
you said about pirates. I hope there are no pirates in these seas. 
We are but in an ill condition to meet with them, for yousee we 
have but a small force, and are but very weakly manned." " Oh, 
sir," says he, ** don't be concerned ; I ao not know that there have 
been any pirates in these seas these fifteen years, except one, which 
was seen, as I hear, in the Bay of Siam, about a month since ; but 
you may be assured she has gone to the southward ; nor was she a 
ship of any great force, or fit for the work. She was not built for a 
privateer, but was run away with by a reprobate crew that was on 
board, 'after the captain and some of his men had been murdered by 
the Malayans, at or near the Island of Sumatra." " What," sakl I, 



350 ROBINSON CRUSOE. v 

seemiDg to know nothing of the matter, ** did they murder the cap- 
lain?" **No," said he, "I don't understand that they murdered 
liini ; but, as they afterward ran away with the ship, it is geneially 
believed that they betrayed him into the hands of the Malayans, who 
did murder liim, and perhaps they procured them to do it." ** Why. 
tiien, " said I, " they deserve death as much as if tliey had done it them- 
selves." *' Nay," says the old man, ** they do deserve it : and they 
will certainly have it if they light upon any English or Dutch ship : 
for ihey have all agreed together, that if they meet that rogue they/II 
give him no quarter." ** But," said I to him, *' you say the pirate is 
gone out of these seas: how can they meet with him then?" 
** Why, that's true," says he. *' they do say so ; but he was, as I tell 
you, in the Bay of Siam, in the River Cambodia, and was discovered 
there by some Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, and who were 
left on shore when they ran away with her ; and some English and 
Dutch traders being in the river, they were within a little of taking 
him ; nay," said he, ** if the foremost boats had been well seconded 
by the rest, they had certainly taken him ; but he, finding only two 
boats- within reach of him, tacked about and fired at those two, and 
disabled them before the others came up, and Uien standing off to 
sea, the others were not able to follow, and so he got awav : but they 
Imve all so exact a description of the ship that they will be sure to 
know her ; and wherever they find her, lliey have vowed to give no 
quarter either to the captain or seamen, but to hang tliem ajl up at 
the yard-arm." " What 1" said I. ** will they execute them, right or 
wrong; hang them first and judge them afterward?" ** Oh, sir," 
says the old pilot, ** there is no need to make a formal business of it 
with such rogues as those ; let them tie them back to back and set 
them a diving— r*tis no more than they deserve." 

I knew I had my old man fast on board, and tliat he could do no 
harm, so that I turned short upon him. "Well, now, seignior," 
said I, '* this is the very reason why I would have you carry us up 
to Nanquin, and not put back to Macao, or to any other part of the 
country where the English or Dutch ships come ; for be it known to 
you, seignior, those captains of the English and Dutch ships are a 
parcel of rash, proud, insolent fellows, that neither know what be- 
longs to justice, nor how to behave themselves as the laws of God and 
nature direct ; but being proud of their ofllces, and not understanding 
their power, they would act the murderers to punish robbers ; would 
take upon them to insult men falsely accused, and determine them 
guilty without due inquiry ; and perhaps 1 may live to bring some of 
them to account for it, when they may t)e taught how justice is to be 
executed ; and that no man ought to be treated as a criminal till 
some evidence may be had of the crime, and that he is the man." 

With this I told him that this was (he very ship Ihey attacked, and 
gave him a full account of the skirmi&h we had with their boats, and 
how foolishly and cowardly they behaved. I told him all the story 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 351 

of our buying the ship, and how the Dutchmen served us. I told 
him the reasons I had to believe the story of killing: the master by the 
Malayans was true, as also the running away with the ship ; but 
it was all a fiction of their own to suggest that the men had turned 
pirates, and they ought to have been sure it was so before they ven- 
tured to attack us by surprise, and oblige us to resist them ; adding 
that thev would have the blood of those men whom we killed there 
in just dcfeuce to answer for. 

The old mao was amazed at this relation, and told us we were 
very much in the right to go away to the north ; and that, if he 
might advise us, it should be to sell the ship in China, which we 
might very well do, and Iniy or buiid another in the country. 
** And," said he, ** though you will not gel so good a ship, yet you 
may get one able enough to carry you and all your goods buck again 
to Bengal, or anywhere else." I told him I would take his advice 
when 1 came to any port where I could find a ship for my turn, or 
get any customer to buy this. He replied I should meet with cus- 
tomers enough for the ship at Nanquin, and that a Chiaese junk 
would serve me very well to go back again ; and that he would pro- 
cure me people both to buy one and sell the other. ** Well, but, 
seignior," said 1, ** as you say they know the ship so well, I may, 
perhaps, if I follow jrour measures, be instrumental to bring some 
honest, innocent men into a terrible broil, and perhaps to be murdered 
in cold blood ; for wherever they find the ship they will prove the 
guilt upon the men, by proving this was the ship ; and so innocent 
men may probably be overpowered and murdered." ** Why," says 
the old man, " I'll find out a way to prevent that also ; for as I know 
all those commanders you speak of very well, and shall see them all 
as they pass by, I will be sure to set them to rights in the thing, and 
let them know that they had been so much in the wrong ; that 
though the people who were on board at first might run away with 
the ship, yet it was not true that they had turned pirates ; and that, 
in particular, these were not the men that first went off with the 
ship, but innocently bought her for their trade ; and I am persuaded 
they will so far believe me, as at least to act more cautiously for the 
time to come." 

While these things were passing between us by way of discourse, 
we went forward directly for Nanquin, and in about thirteen days' 
sail came to an anchor at the south-west point of the great Gulf of 
Nanquin ; where, by the way, I came by accident to understand 
that two Dutch ships were gone the length before me, and that I 
should certainly fall into their hands. 1 consulted my partner again 
in this exigency, and he was as much at a loss as I was, and would 
very gladly have been safe on shore almost anywhere: however, I 
was not in such perplexity neither, but I asked the old pilot if there 
was no creek or harbor which I might put into and pursue my busi- 
hess with the Chinese privately, and be in no danger of the enemy. 



352 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

He told me if I would sail to the southward about forty-two leagues, 
there was a little port called Quinchaug, where the fathers of the 
mission usually lauded from Macao, on Iheir progress to leach the 
Christian religion to th^ Chinese, and where no European ships ever 
put in ; and if I thought to put in there, I might consider what fur- 
ther course to take when I was on shore. He confessed, he said, it 
was not a place for merchants, except that at some certain times they 
had a kind of a fair there, when the merchants from Japan came 
over thither to buy Chinese merchandises. 

We all agreed to go back to this place : the name of the port, as 
he called it, I may perhaps spell wrong, for I do not particularly re- 
member it, having lost this, together with the names of many other 
places set down in a little pocketbook, which was spoiled by the 
water by an accident : but this I remember — that the Chinese or Jap- 
anese merchants we corresponded with called it by a different name 
from that which our Portuguese pilot gave it, and pronounced it as 
above, Quinchang. 

Ah we w€re imanimous in our resolution to go to this place, we 
weighed the next day, having only gone twice on shoie where we 
were, to get fresh water ; on both which occasions the people of the 
country were very civil to us, and brought abundance of things to 
sell to us ; I mean of provisions, plants, roots, tea, rice, and some 
fowls ; but nothing without money. 

We did not come to the other port (the wind being contrary) for 
^ve days ; but it was very much to our satisfaction ; and I was joy- 
ful, and I may say thankful, when I set my foot on shore, resolvmg, 
and my partner too, that if it was possible to dispose of ourselves and 
effects any other way, though not every way to our satisfaction, we 
would never set one foot on board that unhappy vessel more ; and 
indeed, I must acknowledge, that of all the circumstances of life that 
ever I had any experience of, nothing makes mnukind so completely 
miserable as that of being in constant fear. Well does the Scripture 
say, ** The fear of man brings a snare :" it is a life of death, and the 
mind is so entirely oppressed by it that it is capable of no relief. 

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy, by heighten- 
ing every danger ; representing the English and Dutch captains to 
be men incapable of hearing reason, or of distinguishing between 
honest men and rogues ; or between a story calculated for our own 
turn, made out of nothing, on purpose to deceive, and a true, genu- 
ine account of our whole voyage, progress, and design ; for we might 
many ways have convinced any reasonable creatures thot we were 
not pirates : the goods we had on board, the course we steered, our 
frankly showing ourselves, and entering into such and such ports ; 
and even our very manner, the force we had, the number of men, the 
few arms, the little ammunition, short provisions ; all these would 
have served to convince any men that we were no pirates. The opi- 
um and other goods we had on board would make it appear the ship 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 353 

had been at Bengal. The Dutchmen, who, it was said, had tlic 
names of all the men that were iii the ship, might easily see that we 
were a mixture of English, Portuguese, and Indians, and but two 
Dutchmen on board. These and many other particular circum- 
stances might have made it evideht to the understanding of any 
commander, whose hands we mi^ht fall into, that we were no pirates. 
But fear, that blind, useless passion, worked another way, and threw 
us into the vapors : it bewildered our understandings, and set the im- 
agination at work to form a thousand terrible things that perhaps 
might never happen. We first supposed (as indeed everybody had 
related to us) that the seamen on board the English and Dutch ships, 
but especially the Dutch, were so enraged at the name of a pirate, and 
especially at our beating off their boats and escaping, that they would 
not give themselves leave to inquire whether we were pirates or no, 
but woujd execute ua offhand, without giving us any room for a de- 
fence. We reflected that there really was so much apparent evidence 
before them that they would scarce inquire after any more ; as, first, 
that the ship was certainly the same, and that some of the seamen 
among them knew her, and had been on board her ; and, secondly, 
that when we had intelligence at the River of Cambodia that they were 
coming down to examine us, we fought their boats and fled ; so that 
we made no doubt but they were as fully satisfied of our being pirates 
as we were satisfied of the contrary ; and, as I often said, I know 
not but I should have been apt to have taken those circumstances for 
evidence, if the tables were turned, and my case was theirs, and 
have made no scruple of cutting all the crew to pieces, without be- 
lieving, or perhaps considering, what they might have to 6ffer in 
their defence. 

But let that be how it will, these were our apprehensions : and 
both my partnci* and I scarce slept a night without dreaming of hal- 
ters and yard-arms — tiiat is to say, gibbets ; of fighting, and being 
taken ; of killing, and being killed : and one night I was in such a 
fury in my dream, fancying the Dutchmen had boarded us, and I 
was knocking one of their seamen down, that I struck my double 
fist against the side of the cabin I lay in with such a force as wounded 
my hand grievously, broke my knuckles, and cut and bruised the 
flesh so that it awaked me out of my sleep. 

Another apprehension I had was, the cruel usage we might meet 
with from them if we fell into their hands : then the story of 
Amboyna came into my head, and how the Dutch might perhaps tor- 
ture us, as they did our countrymen there, and make some of our 
men, by extremity of torture, confess those crimes they never were 
guilty of, or own thomselvcs and nil of us to be pirates, and so they 
would put us to death, with a formal appearance of justice ; and 
that they might be tempted to do this for the gain of our ship and 
caigo, which were worth four or five thousand pounds altogether. 

These things tormented me, and my partner too, night and day ; 

R. C.-12

nor did we consider that the captains of ships have no authority to 
aot thus ; and if we had surrendered prisoners to them, the}^ could 
not answer the destroying us or torturing us, but would be account- 
able for it when they came to their country ; this, I say, gave me no 
satisfaction ; for if they were to act thus with us, what advantage 
would it be to us that they should be called to an account for itV or 
if we were first to be muraered, what satisfaction would it be to us (o 
have them punished when they came home ? 

I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections I now had 
upon the vast variety of my particular circumstances ; how hard I 
thought it was that I. who had spent forty years in a life of continual 
difficulties, and was at last come, as it were, to the port or haven 
which all men drive at, viz., to have rest and plenty, should be a 
volunteer in new sorrows by ray own unhappy choice ; and that I, 
who had escaped so many dangers in my youth, should now come to 
be hanged in my old age, and in so remote a place, for a crime which 
I was not in the least inclined to, much less guilty of. 

After these thoughts, something of religion would come in ; and I 
would be considering that this seemed to me to be a disposition of 
immediate Providence, and I ought to look upon it and submit to it 
as such ; that although I was innocent as to men, I was far from 
being innocent as to my Maker ; and 1 ought to look in and examine 
what other crimes in my life were most obvious to me, and for which 
Providence might justly inflict this punishment as a retribution ; and 
that 1 ought to submit to this, just as I. would to a shipwreck, if it 
had pleased God to have brought such a disaster upon me. 

In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take its place, and 
then I would be talking myself up to vigorous i^esoUitions ; that I 
would not be taken, to be barbarously used by a parcel of merciless 
wretches in cold blood ; that it were much belter to have fallen into 
the hands of the savages, though I was sure they would feast upon 
me when they had taken me, than those who would perhaps glut 
their rage upon me by inhuman tortures and barbarities ; that in the 
casg of the savages, I always resolved to die fighting to the last gasp, 
and why should I not do so now, seeing it was much more dreadful, 
to me at least, to think of falling into these men's hands, than ever 
it was to think of being eaten by men ? for the savages, give them 
their due, would not eat a man till he was killed and dead, but that 
these men had many arts beyond the cruelty of death. Whenever 
these thoughts prevailed, I was sure to put myself into a kind of 
fever with the agitation of a supposed fight ; my blood would boil, 
and my eyes sparkle, as if I was engaged, j^nd I was always re- 
solved to take no quarter at their hands ; but even, at last, if I could 
resist no longer, I would blow up the ship and all that was in her, 
and leave them bjit little booty to boast of. 

The greater weight the anxieties and perplexities of these things 
were to our thoughts while we were at sea, the greater was our satis- 



ROBINSOl^r CRUSOE. 355 

faction when we saw ourselves on shore ; and my partner told me he 
dreamed that he had a very heavy load upon his back, which he Was 
to carry up a hill, and found that he was not able to stand longer 
under it ; but that the Portuguese pilot came and took it off his back, 
and the hill disappeared, the ground before him appearing all smooth 
and plain : and truly it was so ; they were all like men who had a 
load taken off their backs. For my part, I had a weight taken off 
from my heart that it was not able any longer to bear ; and as I said 
above, we resolved to go no more to sea in that ship. When we 
came on shore, the old pilot, who was now our friend, got us a lodg- 
ing and a warehouse for our goods, which, by the way, was much 
the same ; it was a little house, or hut, with a larger house adjoining 
to it, all built with canes, and palisadoed round with large canes, to 
keep out pilfering thieves, of which, it seems, there were not a few 
in that country '."however, the magistrates allowed us a little guard, 
and we had a soldier with a kind of halberd, or half pike, who stood 
sentinel at our door ; to whom we allowed a pint of rice and a little 
piece of money, about the value of threepence, per day, so that our 
goods were kept very safe. 

The fair, or mart, usually kept at this place, had been over some 
time : however, we found that there were three or four junks in the 
river, and^Vvo Japanners (I mean ships from Japan) with goods 
which they had bought in China, and were not gone away, having 
some Japanese merchants on shore. 

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us was to ^et us 
acquainted with three missionary Romish pries^ who were m the 
town, and who had been there some time converting the people to 
Christianity : but we thought they made but poor work of it, and 
made them but sorry Christians when they had done : however, that 
was none of our business. One of these was a Frenchman, whom 
they called Father Simon ; anotlier was a Portuguese ; and the third 
a Genoese ; but Father Simon was courteous, easy in his manner, 
and very agreeable company ; the other two were more reserved, 
seemed rigid and austere, and applied seriously to the work they 
came about, viz., to talk with and insinuate themselves among the 
inliabitants, wherever they had opportunity. We often ate and 
drank with those men ; and though, I must confess, the conversion, 
as they call it, of the Chinese to Christianity, is so far from the true 
conversic n required to bring heathen people to the faith of Christ, 
that it seems to amount to little more than letting them know the 
name of Christ, and say some prayers to the Virgin Mary and her 
Sou, in a tongue whicli they understand not, and to cross themselves 
and the like, yet it must be confessed tliat the religionists, whom we 
call missionaries, have a Arm belief that these people will be saved, 
and (hat they are the instruments of it ; and on this account they 
undergo nut only the fatigue of the voyage, and the hazards of living 



356 KOBINSON CRUSOE.

in such places, but oftentimes death itself, and the most violent tor- 
tures, for the sake of this work. 

But to return to my story : This French priest, Father Simon, 
was appointed, it seems, by order of the chief of the mission, to go 
up to Pekin, the royal seat of the Chinese emperor, and waited only 
for another priest, who was ordered to come to him from Macao, to 
go along with him ; and we scarce ever met together but he was in- 
viting me to go that journey ; telling me how he would show me all 
the glorious things of that mighty empire, and, among the rest, the 
greatest city in the world — "A city," said he, ** that your London 
and our Paris put together cannot be equal to." This was the cil3'^ of 
Pekin, which, I confess, is very great, and infinitely full of people ; 
but as I looked on those things with different eyes from other men, 
so I shall give my opinion of Uicm in a few words, when I conie in 
the course of my travels to speak more particulai ly of them. 

But first I come to my friar or missionary. Dining with him one 
day, and being very merry together, I showed some little inclination 
to go with him ; and he pressed me and my partner very hard, and 
with a great many persuasions, to consent. ** Why, Father Simon," 
says my partner, '* should you desire our company so much ? You 
know we are heretics, and you do not love us, nor cannot keep uS 
company with any pleasure." "Oh," says he, "you TOy perhaps 
be good Catholics in time ; my business here is to convert heathens, 
and who knows but I may convert you too V" " Very well. Father," 
said I, "so you will preach to us all the way?" "I will not be 
troublesome to you," says he ; " our religion does not divest us of 
good manners ; besides, we are here like countrymen ; and so we 
are, compared to the place we are in ; and if you are Huguenots, and 
1 a Catholic, we may all be Christians at last ; at least, we are all gen- 
tlemen, and we may converse so, without being uneasy to one an- 
other." I liked this part of his discourse very well, and it began to 
put me in mind of my priest that I had left in the Brazils ; but tliis- 
Father Simon did not come up to his character by a great deal : for 
though Father Simon had no appearance of a criminal levity in him, 
yet he had not that fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and sincere 
affection to religion, that my other good ecclesiastic had. 

But to leave him a little, though he never left us, nor soliciting us 
to go with him, we had something else before us at first, for we had 
all this while our ship and our merchandise to dispose of, and we be- 
gan to be very doubtful what we should do, for we were now in a 
place of very little business ; and once I was about to venture to sail 
for the River of Kilara and the city of Nanquin ; but Providence 
seemed now more visibly, as I thought, than ever, to concern itself in 
our affairs ; and I was encouraged, from this very time, to think I 
should, one way or other, get out of this entangled circumstance, and 
be brought home to my own country again, though I had not the 
least view of the manner. Providence, f say, began here to clear up 



ROBINSON" CRUSOE. 367 

our way a little ; and the first thing that offered was, that our old 
Poituguese pilot brought a Japan merchant to us, who inquired what 
goods we had ; and, in the first place, he bought all our opium, and 
gave us a very good price for it, paying us in gold by weight, some 
in small pieces (rf their own coin, and some in small wedges, of about 
ten or twelve ounces each. While we were dealing with him for our 
opium, it came into my head that he might perhaps deal for the ship 
too, and I ordered the interpreter to propose it to him ; he shrunk up 
his shoulders at it, when it was first proposed to him ; but in a few 
days after he came to me, with one of the missionary priests for his 
interpreter, and told me he had a proposal to make to me, which was 
this : he had bought a great quantity of goods of us, when he had no 
thoughts of proposals made to him of buying the ship ; and that, 
therefore, he had not money to pay for the ship : but if I would let 
the same men who were in the ship navigate her, he would hire the 
ship to go to Japan ; and would send tbem from thence to the Philip- 
pine Islands with another loading, which he would pay the freight 
of before they went from Japan ; and that at their return he would 
buy the ship. I began to listen to his proposal ; and so eager did my 
head still run upon ramblinff, that I could not but begin to entertain 
a notion of going myself with him, and so to set sail from the Philip- 
pine Islands away to the South Seas : accordingly I asked the Japa- 
nese merchant if he would not hire us to the Philippine Islands and 
discharge us there. He said no, he could not do that, for then he 
could not have the return of his cargo ; but ho would discharge us in 
Japan, at the ship's return. Well, still I was for taking him at that 
proposal, and going myself ; but my partner, wiser than myself, 
persuaded me from it, representing the dangers, as well of the seas 
as of the Japanese, wbo are a false, cruel, and treacherous people ; 
likewise those of the Spaniards at the Philippines, more false, cruel, 
and treacherous than they. 

But t6 bring this long turn of our affairs to a conclusion : the first 
thing we had to do was to consult with the captain of the ship, and 
with his men, and know if they were willing to go to Japan : and 
while I was doing this, the young man whom my nephew had left 
with me as my companion for my travels came to me, and told me 
that he thought that voyage promised very fair, and that there was a 
great pro^^ect of advantage, and he would be very glad if I under- 
took it ; but that if I would not, and would give him leave, he would 
go as a merchant, or as I pleased to order him ; that if ever he came 
to England, and I was there and alive, he would render me a faith- 
ful account of his success, which should be as much mine as I 
pleased. I was really loath to part with him ; but considering the 
prospect of advantage, which really was considerable, and that he 
was a young fellow as likeljrto do well in it as any I knew, I inclined 
to let him go ; but I told him I would consult my partner and give 
him an answer the next day. My partner and I discoursed about it. 



358 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

and my partner made a most generous offer. *' You know it has 
been an unlucky sbip,** said he, *' and we both resolve not to go to 
sea in it again ; if your steward (so he called my man) will venture 
the voyage, I will leave my share of the vessel to him, and let him 
make the best of it ; and if we live to meet in England, and he meets 
with success abroad, he shall account for one half of the profits of the 
ship's freight to us ; the other shall be his own." 

If my partner, who was no way concerned with my young man, made 
him such an offer, I could do no less than offer him the same ; and 
all the ship's company being willing to go with him, we made over 
half the ship to him in property, and took a writing from him, oblig- 
ing him to account for the other, and away he went to Japan. The 
Japan merchant proved a very punctual, honest man to him ; pro- 
tected him at Japan, and got him a license to come on shore, which 
the Europeans in general have not lately obtained, paid him his freight 
very punctually, sent him to the Philippines loaded with Japan and 
China wares, and a supercargo of their own, who, trafficking with 
the Spaniards, brought back European goods again, *and a great quan- 
tity of cloves and other spices ; and there he was not only paid his 
freight very well, and at a very good price, but not being willing to 
sell the ship then, the merchant furnished him goods on his own ac- 
count ; and with some money and some spices of his own which he 
brought with him, he went back to the Manillas to the Spaniards, 
where he sold his cargo very well. Here, having got a good ac- 
quaintance at Manilla, he got his ship made a free ship, and the gov- 
ernor of Manilla hired him to go to Aeapulco, in America, on the 
coast of Mexico, and gave him a license to land there and to travel to 
Mexico, and to pass in any Spanish ship to Eui'ope with all his men. 
lie made the voyage to Aeapulco very happily, and there he sold his 
ship ; and having there also obtained alloAvance to travel by land to 
Porto Bello, he found means, somehow or'other, to get to Jamaica^ 
with all his treasure ; and about eight years after came to England, 
exceeding rich ; of which I shall take notice in its place : in the 
mean time I return to our particular affairs. 

Being now to part with the ship and ship's company, it came be- 
fore us of course to consider what recompense we should give to the 
two men that gave us such timely notice of the design against us in 
the River Cambodia. The truth was, they had done us a very con- 
siderable service, and deserved well at our hands ; though, by the 
war, they were a couple of rogues too ; for, as they believed the 
story of our being pirates, and that we had re*ally run away with the 
ship, they came down to us, not only to betray the design that 
was formed against us, but to go to sea with us as pirates ; and 
one of them confessed afterward that nothing else but the hopes of 
gging a-roguing brought him to do it : however, the service they did 
us was not the less, and, therefore, as I had promised to be grateful 
to them, I first ordei:ed the money to be paid them which they said 



ROBIXSOlJf CRUSOE. 359 

"was due to them on board their respective ships ; over and above 
that I gave each, of theih a small sum of money in gold, which con- 
tented them very well ; then I made the Englishman gunner in the 
ship, the gunner being now made. second mate and purser; the 
Dutchman I made boatswain ; so they were both very well pleased, 
and proved very serviceable, being both able seamen and very stout 
fellows. 

We were now on shore in China ; if I thought mvself banished and 
remote from my own country at Biengal, where I had many ways to 
get home for my money, what could I think of myself now, when I 
was got about a thousand leagues farther off from home, and per- 
fectly destitute of all manner of prospect of return ? All we had for 
it was this — that in about four months' time there was to be another 
fair at the place where we were, and then we might be able to pur- 
chase all sorts of the manufactures of the country, and withal might 
possibly find some Chinese junks or vessels from Tonquin, that 
would be to be sold, and would carry us and our goods whither wo 
pleased. This I liked very well, and resolved to wait ; besides, as 
our particular persons were not obnoxious, so if any English or 
Dutch ships came thither, perhaps we might have an opportunity to 
load our goods and get passage to some other place in India nearer 
home. Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here ; but, to 
divert ourselves, we took two or three journeys into the country. 
First we went ten days* journey to the city of Nanquin, a city well 
worth seeing indeed ; they say it has a million of people in it : it is 
regularly built, the streets all exactly straight, and cross one another 
in direct lines, which gives the figure of it great advantage. But 
when I come to compare the miserable people of these countries with 
ours, their fabrics, their manner of living, their government, their 
religion, their wealth, and their glory, as some call it, I must confess 
that I scarcely think it worth my while to mention them here. It is 
very observable, that we wonder at the grandeur, the riches, the 
pomp, the ceremonies, the government, the manufactures, the com- 
merce, and conduct of these people ; not that it is to be wondered at, 
or, indeed, in the least to be regarded, but because, having a true 
notion of the barbarity of those countries, the rudeness and the igno- 
rance that prevail there, we do not expect to find any such thing so 
far off. Otherwise, what are their buildings to the palaces and royal 
buildings of Europe ? What their trade to the universal commerce 
of England, Holland, France, and Spain ? What are their cities to 
ours, for wealth, strength, gayety of apparel, rich furniture, and.infl- 
nite variety ? What are their ports, supplied with a few junks and 
barks, to our navigation, our merchant fleets, our large and powerful 
navies ? Our city of London has more trade than half their mighty 
empire : one English, Dutch, or French man-of-war of eighty guns 
would be able to fight almost all the shipping belonging to China : 
but the greatness of their wealth, their trade, the power of their gov- 



360 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

emment, and the strength of their armies, may be a little surpiisiDg 
to U8, because, as I have said, considering them as a barbarous nation 
of pagans, little better than savages, we did not expect such things 
among them : and this, indeed, is the advantage witli which all their 
greatness and power is represented to us ; otherwise, it is in itself 
nothmg at all ; for what I have said of their ships may be said of 
their armies and troops ; all the forces of their empire, though they 
were to bring two millions of men into the field together, would he 
able to do nothing but ruin the country and starve themselves, if 
they were to besiege a strong town in Flanders, orjto fight a disci- 
plined army ; one good line of Grerman cuirassiers or of French cav- 
alry might withstand all the horse of China ; a million of their foot 
could not stand before one embattled body of our infantry, posted so 
as not to be surrounded, though they were not to be one to twenty in 
number ; nay, I do not boast if I say that thirty thousand German or 
EngUsh foot, and ten thousand hoise, well managed, could defeat all 
the forces of China. And so of our fortified towns : and of the art 
of our engineers in assaulting and defending towns ; there is not a 
fortified town in China could hold out one month against the batte- 
ries and attacks of a European army ; and, at the same time, all the 
armies of China could never take such a town as I)unkirk, provided 
it was not starved ; no, not in a ten years' siege. They have fire- 
arms, it is true, but they are awkward and uncertain in their going 
off ; and their powder has but little strength. Their nrmies are 
badly disciplined, and want skill to attack or temper to retreat ; and 
therefore, I must confess, it seemed strange to me, when I came 
home, and heard our people say such fine thmgs of the power, glory, 
magnificence, and trade -of the Chinese ; because, as far as I saw, 
they appeared to be a contemptible herd or crowd of ignorant, sordid 
slaves, subjected to a government qualified only to rule such a peo- 
ple ; and were not its distance inconceivably great from Muscovy, 
and the Muscovite empire in a manner as rude, impotent, and ill gov- 
erned as they, the Czar of Muscovy might with ease dri\ e them all 
out of their country and conquer them in one campaign ; and had 
the Czar (who is now a growing prince) fallen this way instead of at- 
tacking the warlike Swedes, and equally improved himself in the art 
of war, as the}^ say he has done, and if none of the powers of Europe 
had envied or interrupted him, he might by this time have been Em- 
peror of China, instead of being beaten by the King of Sweden at 
i^arva, when the latter was not one to six in number. As their 
strength and their grandeur, so their navigation, commerce, and hus- 
bandry, are very imperfect compared to the same things in Europe ; 
^iso in their knowledge, their learning, and in their skill in the sci- 
ences, they are either very awkward or defective, though they have 
globes or spheres, and a smattering of the mathematics, and think 
they know more than all the world besides ; but they know little of 
the motions of the heavenly bodies ; and so grossly and absurdly 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 361 

ignorant are their common people tliat wiien tlie suU is eclipsed they 
think a great dragon has assaulted it, and is going to run away with 
it ; and they fall a clattering with ail tlie drums and kettles in the 
country to fright the monster away, just as we do to hive a swarm of 
bees. 

As this is the only excursion of the kind which I have made in air 
the accounts I have given of my travels, so I shall make no more 
such ; it is none of my business, nor any part of my design, but to 
give an account of my own adventures llirough a life of inimitable 
wanderings, and a long variety of changes, which, perhaps, few that 
come after me will have heard the like of : I shall therefore say very 
little of all the mighty places, desert countries, and numerous people 
I have yet to pass through, more than relates to my own stoiy, and 
which my concern among them makes necessary. 

I was now, as near as 1 can compute, in the heart of China, about 
thirty degrees north of the line, for we were returned from Nanquin. 
I had, indeed, a mind to see the city of Pekin, which I had heard so 
jnuch of, and Father Simon importuned me daily to do it. At length 
his time of going away being set, and the other missionary who was 
to go with him being arrived from Macao, it was necessary that we 
should resolve either to go or not ; so I referred it wholly to my part- 
ner, and left it wholly to his choice, who at length resolved it in the 
affirmative, and we prepared for our journey. We set out with very 
good advantage, as to finding the way ; for we got leave to travel in 
the retinue of one of their mandarins, a kind of viceroy or principal 
magistrate in the province where they reside, and who take great 
state upon them, travelling with great attendance, and great homage 
from the people, who are sometimes greatly impoverished by them, 
being obliged to furnish provisions for them and all their attendants 
in their journeys. That which I particularly observed in our travel- 
ling with his baggage was this — that though we received sufficient 
provisions both for ourselves and our horses from the country, as be- 
longing to the mandarin, yet we were obliged to pay for everything 
we had after the market price of the country, and the mandarin's 
steward collected it duly from us ; so that our travelling in the ret- 
inue of the mandarin, though it was a very great kindness to us, was 
not such a mighty favor in him, but was a great advantage to him, 
considering there were above thirty other people travelled in the same 
manner besides us, under the protection of his retinue ; for tl>e coun- 
try furnished all the provisions for nothing to him, and yet he took 
our money for them. 

We were twenty -five days travelling to Pekin, through a country 
infinitely populous, but I think badly cultivated ; the husbandry, the 
economyj and the way of living miserable, though they l)oast so 
much of the industry of the people ; I say miserable, if compared 
with our own, but not so to these poor wretches who know no other. 
The pride of the people is infinitely great, and exceeded by nothing 



362 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

but their poverty, in some parts, which adds to that which I call their 
misery ; and I must needs think the native savages of America live 
much more happy than the poorer sort of these, because as they have 
nothing, so they desire nothing ; whereas these are proud and inso- 
lent, and in the main are in many parts mere beggars and drudges ; 
"their ostentation is inexpressible ; and, if they can, they love to keep 
multitudes of servants or slaves, which is to the last degree ridicu- 
lous, as well as their contempt of all the world but themselves. 

I must confess I travelled moie pleasantly afterward in the deserls 
and vast wildemcsbes of Grand Tartary than here, and yet the roads 
here are well paved and well kept, and very convenient for travel- 
lers ; hut nothing was more awkward to me than to see such a 
haui>:hty, imperious, insolent people, in the midst of the grossest sim- 
plicity and ignorance ; and my friend Father Simon and I used to be 
very meriy upon these occasions, to see the beggarly pride of these 
people. For exam{)le, coming by the house of a country gentleman, 
as Father Simon called him, about ten leagues off the city of Nan- 
quin, we had first of all the honor to ride with the master of the house 
about two miles ; the state he rode in was a perfect Bon Quixotism, 
being a mixture of pomp and poverty. His habit was very proper 
for a scaramouch or merry-andrew, being a dirty calico, with hang- 
ing sleeves, tassels, and cuts and slashes almost on every side : it 
covered a taffety vest, as greasy as a butcher's, and which testified 
that his honor must be a most exquisite sloven. His horse was but a 
poor, starved, hobbling creature, and he had two slaves followed him 
on foot to drive the poor creature along ; he had a whip in his hand, 
and he belabored the beast as fast about the head as his slaves did 
about the tail ; and thus he rode by us. with about ten or twelve ser- 
vants, going from the city to his country-seat, about half a league be- 
fore us. We travelled on gently, but this figure of a gentleman 
rode away before us ; and as we stopped at a village about an hour 
to refresh us, when we came by the country-seat of thisgreat man, 
we saw him in a little place before his door eating a repast. . It was 
a kind of garden, but he was easy to be seen ; and we were given to 
understand that the more we looked at him the better he would be 
pleased. He sat under a tree something Hke the palmetto, which 
effectually shaded him over head, and on the south side ; but under 
the tree was placed a large umbrella, which made that part look well 
enough. He sat lolling back in a great elbow-chair, being a heavy, 
corpulent man, and had his meat brought him by two women slaves. 
He had two more, one of whom fed the squire with a spoon, and the 
other held the dish with one hand and scraped off what he let fall 
upon his worship's beard and taffety vest. 

Thus leaving the poor wretch to please himself with our looking at 
him, as if we admired his pomp, though we really pitied and con* 
temned him, we pursued our .iournev ; only Father Simon had the 
curiosity to stay to inform himself what dainties the country justice 



ROBIKSOK 0RU30B. 363 

had to feed on in all his state, which he had the honor to taste of, and 
which was, I think, a mess of boiled rice, with a great piece of garlic 
in it, and a little bag filled with green pepper, and another plant 
which they have there, something like our ginger, but smelling like 
musk and tasting like mustard ; all this was put together, and a small 
piece of lean mutton boiled in it, and this was his worship's repast. 
Four or five servants more attended at a distance, who we supposed 
were to eat of the same after their master. 

As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, he was respected as 
a king, surrounded alwa3's with his gentlemen, and attended in all 
his appearances with such pomp that I saw little of him but at a dis- 
tance. But this I observed, that there was not a horse in his retinue 
but that our carriers' packhorses in England seemed to me to look 
much better ; though it was hard to judge rightly, for they were so 
covered with equipage, mantles, trappings, etc., that we could scarce 
see anything but their feet and their heads as they went along. 

I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and perplexity that I 
have given an account of being over, I had no anxious thoughts 
about me, which made this journey the pleasanter to me ; nor had I 
any ill accident attended me, only in passing or fording a small river 
my horse fell, and made me free of the country, as they call it — that 
is to say, threw me in. The place was not deep, but it wetted me all 
over. I mention it because it spoiled my pocketbook, wherein I 
had set down the names of several people and places which I had oc- 
cjision to remember, and which, not taking due care of, the leaves 
rotted, and the words were never after to be read, to my great loss, 
as to the names of some of the places I touched at in this journey. 

At length we arrived at Pekin. I had nobody with me but the 
youth whom my nephew the captain had given me to attend me as a 
servant, and who proved very trusty and diligent ; and my partner 
had nobody with him but one servant who was a kinsman. As. for 
the Portuguese pilot, he being desirous to see the court, we bore his 
charges for his company, and to use him as an interpreter, for he un- 
derstood the language of the country, and spoke good French and a 
little English ; and indeed this old man was a most useful implement 
to us everywhere ; for we had not been abovela week' at Pekin when 
he came laughing. *' Ah, Seignior Inglese," says he, "I have some- 
thing to tell will makeyonr heart glad." ** My heart glad,'* says I ; 
** what can that be ? I don't know anything in this country can either 
give me joy or grief to any great degree." " Yes, yes," said the 
ojd man in broken English, ** make you glad, me sorry." *' Why," 
said I, ** will it make you sorry ?" ** Because," said he, *' you have 
brought me here twenly-five days' journey, and will leave me to go 
back alonu ; and which way shall I get to my port afterward, with- 
out a ship, without a horse, without pecune?*' — so he called money, 
being his broken Latin, of which he had abundance to make us merry 
with. In sliort, he told us there was a great caravan of Muscovite 



364 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

V 

and Polish merchants in the city, preparing to set out on their Jour- 
ney by land to Muscovy, within four or five weeks ; and he was sure 
we would take the opportunity to go with them, and leave him be- 
hind, to go back alone. 

1 confess I was greatly sui prised with this good news, and had 
scarce power to speak to him for some time ; but at last I turned to 
him. "How do you know thisf* said I: **are you sure it is 
true?*' ** Yes," says he ; *' I met this morning in the street an old 
acquaintance of mine, an Armenian who is among them. He came 
last from Astracan, and was designing to go to Tonquin, where I 
formerly knew him, but has altered his mind, and is now resolved to 
go with the caravan to Moscow, and so down the River Wolga to 
Astracan." ** Well, seignior," says I, *' do not be uneasy about be- 
ing left to go back alone ; if this be a method for my return to Eng- 
land, it shall be your fault if you go back to Macao at all." We 
then went to consult together what was to be done ; and I asked my 
partner what he thought of the pilot's news, and whether it would 
suit with his affairs ? He told me he would do just as I would ; for 
he had settled all his affairs so well at Bengal, and left his effects in 
such good hands, that as we had made a good voyage here, if he 
could invest it in China silks, wrought and raw, such as mi^ht be 
worth the carriage, he would be content to go to England, and then 
make his voyage back to Bengal by the Company's ships. 

Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our Portuguese pilot 
would go with us, we would bear his charges to Moscow, or to Eng- 
land, if he pleased ; nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed over-gen- 
erous in that either, if we had not rewarded him farther, the service 
he had done us being really worth more than that ; for he had not 
only been a pilot to us at sea, but he had been like a broker for us 
on shore ; and his procuring for us the Japan merchant was some 
hundreds of pounds in our pockets. So we consulted together about 
it, and being willing to gratify him, which was but doing him jus- 
tice, and very willing also to have him with us besides, for he was a 
most necessary man on all occasions, we agreed to give him a quan- 
tity of coined gold, which, as I compute it, came to about one hun- 
dred and seventy-five pounds sterling between us, and to bear all his 
charges, both for himself and horsey except only a horse to carry his 
goods. Having settled this between ourselves, we called him to let 
him know what we had resolved. 1 told hira he had complaineil of 
our being willing to let him go back alone, and I was now about to 
tell him we were resolved he should not go back at all ; that as he 
had resolved to go to Europe wilh the caravan, we resolved also he 
should go with us ; and that we called him to know his mind. He 
shook his head, and said it was -a long journey, and that he had no 
peeune to carry him thither, or to subsist himself when he came 
there. We told him we believed it was so, and tlwjrefore we had re- 
solved to do something for him that should let him see how sensible 



J 



KOBIJS'SON CRUSOE. 365 

we were of tlie service he had done us, and also how agreeable he 
vas to us ; and then I lold him what we had resolved to give him 
here, which he might lay out as we would do our own ; and that as 
for his charges, if he would go with us we would set him safe on 
shore (life and casualties excepted), either in Muscovy or England, 
which he would, at our own charge, except only the carriage of his 
goods. He received the proposal like a man transported, ana told us 
he would go with us over the whole world ; and so we all prepared 
for our journey. However, as it was with us, so it was with the 
other merchants ; they had many things to do, and instead of being 
ready in five weeks, it was four months and some days before all 
things were got together. 

It was the beginning of February, our style, when we set out from 
Pekin. My partner and the old pilot haa gone express back to the 
port where we had first put in, to dispose of some goods which we 
had left there ; and I, with a Chinese merchant whom I had some 
knowledge of at Nanquin, and who came to Pekin on his own 
affairs, went to Nanquiu, where I bought ninety pieces of fine dam- 
asks, with about two hundred pieces of other very fine silks of sev- 
eral sorts, some mixed with gold, and had all these brought to Pekin 
against my partner's return : besides this, we bought a very large 
quantity of raw silk and some other goods, our cargo amounting, in 
these goods only, to about three thousand five hundred pounds ster- 
ling ; which, together with tea and some fine calicoes, and three cam- 
els' loads of nutmegs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen- camels for our 
share, besides those we rode upon ; which, with two or three spare 
horses, and two horses loaded with provisions, made us, in short, 
twenty-six camels and horses in our retinue. 

The company was very great, and, as near as I can remember, 
made between three and four hundred horse, and upward of one 
hundred and twenty msn, very well armed, and provided for all 
events; for as the Eastern caravans are subject to be attacked By 
the Arabs, so arc these by the Tartars ; but they are not altogether so 
dangerous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous when they prevail. 

The company consisted of people of several nations; but there 
were above sixty of them merchants or inhabitants of Moscow, 
though of them some were Livonians ; and to our particular satisfac- 
tion, five of them were Scots, who appeared also to be men of great 
experience in business and of very good substance. 

When we had travelled one day's journey, the guides, who were 
five in number, called all the gentlemen and mercliants — that is to 
say, all the passengers except the servants — to a great council, as they 
called it. At this council every one deposited a certain quantity of 
money to a common stock, for the necessary expense of buying for- 
age on the way, where it was not otherwise to he had, and for satis 
fying the guides, getting horses, and the like : and here they const! 
tuted tbe journey, as they call it, viz., they named captains and ofii- 



t

366 AOBINSON CRUSOE. 

cers to draw us all. up and give the word of command, in case of an 
attack, and give every one their turn of command ; nor was this 
forming us into order any more than what we found needful on the 
way, as shall be observed. 

The road all on this side of the country is very populous, and is 
full of potters and earth-makers — that is to say, people that temper 
the earth for the china-ware ; and as I was coming along, our Portu- 
guese pilot, who had always something or other to say to make U3 
merry, came sneering to me, and told me he would show me the 
greatest rarity in all the country, and that I should have this to say 
of China, after all the ill-humored things that I had said of it — that I 
had seen one thing which was not to be seen in all the world beside. 
I was very importunate to know what it was ; at last he told me it 
was a gentleman's house built with china-ware. *' Well," says I, 
*' are not the materials of their buildings the product of their own 
cojmtry ? and so it is all china-ware — is it not?*' ** No, no," says 
he ; ** I mean it is a house all made of china-ware, such as you call 
it in England, or, as it is called in our country, porcelain." 
"Well," says I. " such a thing may be: how big is it? Can we 
carry it in a box upon a camel? If we can we will T>uy it." 
" Upon a camel !" says the old pilot, holding up both his hands', 
** why, there is a family of thirty people lives in it." 

I was then curious, indeed, to see it ; and when I qame to it it was 
nothing but this : it was a timber house, or a house built, as we call 
it in England, with lath and plaster ; but all this plastering was 
really china-ware — that is to say, it was plastered with the earth that 
makes china-ware. The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was 
glazed, and looked very well, perfectly white, and painted with blue 
ligures, »s the large. china-ware in England is painted, and hard as if 
it had been burned. As to the inside, all the walls, instead of wain- 
scot, were lined with hardened and painted tiles, like the little squaro 
tiles we call galley -tiles in England, all made of the finest china, and 
the figiires exceeding fine indeed, with extraordinary variety of col- 
ors, mixed with gold, many tiles making but one figure, but joined 
so artificially, the morttir being made of the same earth, that it was 
very hard to see where the tiles met. The floors of the rooms were 
of the same composition, and as hard as the earthen floors we have in 
use in several parts of England ; as hard as stone, and smooth, but 
not burned and painted, except some smaller rooms, like closets, 
which were all, as it were, paved with the same tile : the ceiling and 
all the plastering work in the whole house were of the same earth ; 
and, after all, the roof was covered with tiles of the same, but of a deep 
shining black. This was a china-ware house indeed, truly and liter- 
ally to be called so ; and had I not l»een upon the journey I could 
have staid some days to see and examine the particulars of it. They 
told me there were fountains and fish-ponds in the garden, all paved 
on the bottom and sides with the same ; and fine statues set up iu 



ROBINS0K CRUSOE. 367 

rows on the walks, entirely formed of the porcelain earth, and burned 
whole. 

As this is one of the singularities of China, so thcjr may be 
allowed to excel in it ; but 1 am very sure they excel in their ac- 
counts of it ; for they told me such incredible things of their per- 
formance in crockery-ware (for such it is) that I care not to relate, as 
knowing it could not be true. One told me in particular of a work- 
man that made a ship, with all its tackle, and masts, and sails, in 
earthenware, big enough to carry fifty men. If he had told me he 
launched it arfd made a voyage to Japan in it, I might have said 
something to it indeed ; but as it was I knew the whole of the storv, 
which was, in slioi t, asking pardon for the word, that the fellow liea ; 
so I smiled, and said nothmg to it. 

This odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan, for which 
the leader of i^ for the day fined me about the value of three shillings ; 
&nd told me if it had been three days* journey without the wall, as 
it Was three days within, he must have fined me four times as much, 
and made me ask pardon the next council day : I promised to be 
more orderly ; and, indeed, I found aftervyard the orders made for 
keeping all together were absolutely necessary for our common 
safety. * 

In two days more we passed the great China wall,^made for a for- 
tification against the Tartars : and a very great work it is, going over 
hills and mountains in a needless track, where the rocks are impassa- 
ble, and the precipices such as no enemy could possibly enter, or in- 
deed climb up, or where, if they did, no wall could hinder them. 
They tell us its length is near a thousand English miles, but that the 
country is five hundred in a straight measured line, which the wall 
bounds, without measuring the windings and turnings it takes ; it is 
about four fathoms high, and as many thick in some places. 

I stood still an hour or thereabout without trespassing our orders 
(for so long the caravan was in passing the gate), to look at it on 
every side, near and far off— I mean that was within my view : and 
the guide of our caravan, who had been extolling it for the wonder 
of the world, was mighty eager to hear my opinion of it. I told him 
it was a most excellent thing to keep out the iWiars ; which he hap- 
pened not to understand as I meant it, and so took it for a compli- 
ment ; but the old pilot laughed. ** Oh, Seignior Inglese,** says he, 
** you speak in colors." ** In colors !" said I ; ** what do you mean 
by that?'* '* Why, you speak what looks white this way and black 
that wav — ^gay one way and dull another. You tell him it is a good 
wall to keep out Tartars ; you tell me by that it is good for nothing 
but to keep out Tartars. I understand you, Seignior Inglese, I un- 
derstand you ; but Seignior Chinese understood you his own way." 
** Well,** says I, '* seigniot, do you think \t would stand out an army 
of our country people, with a good train of artillery ; or our engi- 
neers, with two companies of miners ? Would not they batter it down

in ten days, that an army jxAght enter in battalia ; or blow it up in 
the air. foundation and all, that there should be no sign of it left ?" 
** Ay, ay," says he, *' I know that." The Chinese wanted mightily 
to know what I said, and I gave him leave to tell him a fevv days 
after, for we were then almost out of their country, and he was to 
leave us a little time after this ; but when he knew what 1 said, he 
was dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard no more of his fine 
story of the Chinese power and greatness while he staid. 

After we passed thjs mighty nothing, called a wall, something like 
the Picts* wall, so famous in Northumberland, built % the Romans, 
we began to find t-he country thinly inhabited, and the people rather 
confined to live in fortified towns and cities, as being subject to the 
inroads and depredations of the Tartars, who rob in great armies, 
and therefore are not to be resisted by the naked inhabitants of an 
open country. And here I beg^ to find the necessity of keeping to- 
gether in a caravan as we travelled, for we saw several troops of Tar- 
tars roving about ; but when I came to see them distinctly, I won- 
dered more that the Chinese empire could be conquered by such con- 
temptible fellows ; for they are a mere horde of wild fellows, keeping 
no order, and understanding no discipline or manner of fight. Their 
horses are poor, lean creatures, taught nothing and fit for nothing ; 
and this we found the first day we saw them, which was after we 
entered the wilder part of the country. Our leader for the day gave 
leave for about sixteen of us to go a hunting, as they call it ; and what 
was this but hunting of sheep !— however, it may be called hunting 
too, f )r the creatures are the wildest and swiftest of foot that ever 1 
saw of their kind ; only they will not run a great way, and you are 
sure of sport when you begin the chase, for they appear generally 
thirty or forty in a flock, and, like true sheep, always keep together 
when they fly. 

In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our hap to meet with 
about forty Tartars : whether they were hunting mutton as we were, 
or whether they looked for another kind of prey, we know not ; but 
as soon as they saw us, one of them blew a kind of horn very loud, 
but with a barbarous sound that I had never heard before, and, bv 
the way, never care to hear again. We all supposed this was to call 
their friends about them ; andf so it was, for in less than ten minuti^s 
a troop of forty or fifty more appeared at about a mile distance ; but 
our work was over first, as it happened. 

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to be among us, 
and as soon as he heard the horn he told us that we had nothing to 
do but to charge them immediately, without loss of time ; and draw- 
ing us up in a line, he asked if we were resolved. We told him we 
were ready to follow him ; so he rode directly toward them. They 
stood gazing at us like a mere crowd, drawn up in no onler. nor 
showing the face of any order at all ; but as soon as they saw us ad- 
vance they let fiy their arrows, which, however, mi»B#d us,, very 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 369 

happily : it seehis they mistook not their aim but their distance ; for 
their arrows all fell a little short of us, but with so true an aim, that 
had we been about twenty yards nearer we must have had several 
men wounded, if not l^illed. 

Immediately we halted, and though it was at a .fijreat distance, we 
fired, and sent them leaden bullets for wooden arrows, following our 
shot full gallop, to fall in among them sword in hand — for so our 
bold Scot that led us directed. He was, indeed, but a merchant, but 
he behaVed with such vigor aud bravery on this occasion, and yet with 
such cool courage too, that I never saw any man in action fitter for 
command. As soon as we capie up to them we fired our pistols in 
their faces and then drew ; but they fied in the greatest confusion 
imaginable. The' only stand any of them made was on our right, 
where three of them stood, and hy signs called the rest to come back 
to them, having a kind of cimeter in their hands and their bows hang- 
ing to their backs. Our brave commander, without asking anybody 
to follow him, gallops up close to them, and with his fusee knocks 
one of them off his horse, killed the second with his pistol, and the 
third ran away ; and thus ended our fight : but we had this misfor- 
tune attending it, that all our mutton we had in chase got away. 
We had not a man killed or hurt ; but as for the Tartars, there were 
about five of them killed ; how many were wounded we knew not ; 
but this we knew, tliat the other party were so frightened with the 
noise of our guns that they made on and never made any attempt 
upon us. 

We were all this while in the Chinese dominions, and therefore 
the Tartars were not so bold as afterward ; but in about five days 
we entered a vast, great, wild desert, which held us three days and 
nights' march ; and we were obliged to carry our water with us in 
great leathern bottles, and to encamp all night, just as I have heard 
they do in the desert of Arabia. 

I asked our guides whose dominion this was in : and they told me 
this was a kind of border, that might be called no man's land, being 
a part of Great Karakathy, or Grand Tartary ; that, however, it was 
all reckoned as belonging to China, but that there was no care taken 
here to preserve it from the inroads of thieves, and therefore it was 
reckoned the worst desert in the whole march, though we were to go 
over some much larger. 

In passing this wilderness, which was at first very frightful to me, 
we saw, two or three times, little parties of the Tartars, but they 
seemed to be upon their own affairs, and to have no design upon us ; 
and so, like the man who met the devil, if they had nothing to say 
to us we had nothing to say to them : we let them go. Once, how- 
ever, a party of them came so near as to stand and gaze at us ; 
whether it was to consider if they should attack us or not, we knew 
not ; but when we had passed at some distance by them, we made a 
rear-guard of forty men, and stood ready for them, letting the cara- 



370 BOBINSOK CRUSOE^ 

van pass half a mile, or thereabout, before us : but after a while 
they jnaiched off ; only we found they saluted us with five arrows at 
their parting, which wounded a horse so that it disabled him, and 
we left him the next day, poor creature, in great need of a good 
farrier : they might shoot more arrows, which might fall short of us, 
but we saw no more arrows or Tartars that time. 

WcLtravelled near a month after this, the ways not being so good 
as at first, though still in the dominions of the Emperor of China, 
but lay for the most part in the villages, s6me of which weVe forti- 
fied, because of the incursions of the Tartars. When we were come 
to one of these towns (it was about t^o days and a half's journey be- 
fore we came to the city of Naum), I wanted to buy a camel, of 
whicli there are plenty to be sold all the way upon that road, and 
horses also, such as they are, because, so many caravans coming that 
way, they are often wanted. The person that I spoke to to get me a 
camel would have gone and fetched one for me ; but I, like a fool, 
must be oflicious, and go myself along with him ; the place was 
about two miles out of the village, where, it seems, they kept the 
camels and horses feeding, under a guard. 

I walked it on foot, with niy old pilot and a Chinese, being veiy 
desirous of a little variety. When we came to the place, it was a 
low, marshy ground, walled round with a stone wall, piled up dry, 
without mortar or earth among it, like a park, with a little guard of 
Chinese soldiers at the door. Having bought a camel, and agreed 
for the price, I came away, and the Chinese man that went wi& me 
led the camel, when on a sudden came up five Tartars on horselnick. 
Two of them seized the fellow and took the camel from him, while 
the other three stepped up to me and my old pilot, seeing us, as it 
were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about me but my sword, which 
could but ill defend me against three horsemen. The first that came 
up stopped short upon my drawing my sword, for they are arrant 
cowards ; but a second, coming upon my left, gave me a blow on 
the head, which I never felt till afterward, and wondered, when I 
came to myself, what was the matter, and where I ^as, for he laid 
me 11 at on the ground ; but my never-failing old pilot, the Portu- 
guese, (so Providence, unlooked for, directs deliverances from dangers 
which to us are unforeseen), had a pistol in his pocket, which I 
knew nothing of, nor the Tartars either ; if they had I suppose 
they would not have attacked us ; but cowards are always boldest 
When there is no danger. The old man, seeing me down, with a 
bold heart stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and laying 
hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling him down by main force 
a little toward him with the other, shot him in the head and laid 
him dead upon the spot. He then immediately stepped up to him 
. who had stopped us, as I said, and before he coula come forward 
again, made a blow at him with a cimeter, which he always wore, 
but missing tJhe man, struck his horse in the side of his head, cut 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 371 

one of the ears off by the root, and a great sh'ce dbwn by thp side of 
his face. The poor beast, enragnd with the wound, was no more to 
be governed byvhia rider, though tlie fellow sat well enough too ; but 
away he flew, and carried him quite out of the pilot's reach, and at 
some distance, rising upon his hind legs, thre^r down the Tartar 
and fell upon him. 

In this interval, the poor Chinese came in who had lost the camel, 
but he had no weapon : however, seeing the Tartar down, and his 
horse fallen upon him, away he runs to him, and seizing upon an 
ugly, ill-favored weapon he had by his side — something like a pole- 
axe, but not a poleaxe neither — he wrenched it from him, and made 
shift to knock his Tartarian brains out with it. But my old man 
had the third Tartar to deal with still ; and seeing he did not fly as he 
expected, nor come on to fight him as he apprehended, but stood 
stock still, the old man stood still ti)0, and fell to work with his tackle 
to charge his pistol again ; but as soon as the Tartar saw the pistol, 
away he scoured and left my pilot — my champion I called him after • 
ward — a complete victory. 

By this time I was a little recovered ; for I thought, when I fiist 
began to wake, that I had been in a sweet sleep ; but, as I said 
above, I wondered where I was, how I came upon the ground, and 
what was the matter : but a fevv moments after, as sense returned, I 
felt pain, though I did not know where ; so I clapped my hand to 
my head and took it away bloody ; then I felt my head ache ; aod 
then in a moment memory returned; and everything was present to 
me again. I jumped upon my feet instantly, and got hold of mv 
sword ; but no enemies were in view : I found a Tartar lying dead, 
and his horse standing very quietly by him ; and, looking farther, I 
saw my champion and deliverer, who had been to see what the 
Chinese had done, coming back with his hanger in his hand. The 
old man, seeing me on my feet, came running to me, and emb^aeetl 
me with a great deal of joy, being afraid before that I haf^ befim 
killed ; and seeing me bloody, would see how I was hurt ; but [c ^/b.p 
not much, only what we call a broken head ; neither did I aftc svar^ 
find any great inconvenience from" the blow, for it was weUayrIn iij 
two or three days. 

We made no great gain, however, by this victory, fo^ /vo lost a 
camel and gained a horse. But that which was remark/,hle, when 
we came back to the village,-..the man demanded to be f^'.d for the 
camel ; I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing t'dfxe the 
Chinese judge of the place. To give him his due, he aci/A with a 
great deal of prudence and impartiality ; and, h'.rlng neard both 
sides, he gravely asked the Chinese man that wen' v/ith me to buy 
the camel, whose servant he was? ** I am no sr,rvai:(/' says he, 
"but went with the stranger.'* "At whose rcjuest?" says the 
justice. ** At the stranger's request," says he. *' Why, then," saya 
the justice, " you were the stranger's servant for the tiiiw.> aud th€i 



372 KOBINSON CRUSOE. 

camel being delivered to his servant, it was delivered to him, and he 
must pay for it. " 

I confess the thin^ was so clear that I had not a word to say ; but, 
admiring to see such just reasoning upon the consequence, and an 
accurate stating of the case, I paid willingly for the camel, and sent 
for another ; but, you may observe, I did not go to fetch it myself 
any more, for I had had enough of that. 

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese empire ; they call it 
fortified, and so it is, as fortifications go there ; for this I will ven- 
ture to affirm, that all the Tartars in Karakathay, which, I believe, 
are some millions, could not batter down the walls with their bows 
and arrows ; but to call it strong, if it were attacked with cannon, 
would be to make those who unaerstand it laugh at you. 

We wanted, as I have said, above two days' journey of this city, 
when messengers were sent express to ever}' part of the road to tell 
all travellers and caravans to halt till they had a guard sent for 
them ; for that an unusual body of Tartars, making ten thousand in 
all, had appeared in the way, about thirty miles beyond the city. 

This was very bad news to travellers ; however, it was carefully 
done of the governor, and we were very glad to hear we should have 
a guard. Accordingly, two days after, we had two hundred soldiers 
sent us from a garrison of the Chinese on our left, and three hundred 
more from the city of Naum, and with these we advanced boldly : 
the tliree hundred soldiers from Naum marched in our front, the two 
hundred in our rear, and our men on each side of our camels, with our 
baggage and the whole caravan in the centre ; in this order, and 
well prepared for battle, we thought ourselves a match for the whole 
ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared ; but the next 
day, when thejr did appear, it was quite another tiling. 

It was early in the morning, when, marching from a well-situated 
little town, called Changu, we had a river to pass, which we were 
obliged to ferry ; and, had the Tartars had any intelligence, then 
had been the time to have attacked us, when, the caravan being over, 
the rear-guard was behind ; but they did not appear there. About 
three hours after, when we were entered upon a desert of about 
fifteen or sixteen miles over, behold, by a cloud of dust they raised, 
we saw an enemy was at hand ; and they were at hand inaeed, for 
they came on upon the spur. 

The Chinese, our guard in the front, who had talked so big the day 
before, began to stagger ; and the soldiers frequently looked behind 
them, which is a certain sign in a soldier that he is just ready to run 
away. My old pilot was of my mind ; and being near me, called 
out, " Seignior Inglese," says he, " those fellows must be encour- 
aged or they will ruin us all ; for if the Tartars come on they will 
never stand it." " I am of your mind," said I ; " but what must be 
done?" *,* Done !" says he; ** let fifty of our men advance, and 
flank them on each wing, and encourage them ; and they will fight 



■: — > » ,-A- 



ROBINSOlff CRUSOE. 373 

like brave fellows in brave company ; but without thla they will 
every man turn his back.'* Immediately I rode up to our leader, 
find told him, who was exactly of our mind ; and accordingly fifty 
of us marched to the right wiog, and fifty to the left, ,and the rest 
made a line of rescue ; and so we marched, leaving the last two 
hundred men to make a body by themselves, and to guard the 
camels ; only that, if need were, they should send a bundled men to 
assist the last fifty. 

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable company 
they were ; how many we could not tell, but ten thousand, we 
thought, was the least ; a party of ihem came on ^rst, and viewed 
our posture, traversing the ground in the front of our line ; and, as 
we found them within gunshot, our leader ordered the two wings to 
advance swiftly, and give them a salvo on each wing with their shot, 
which was done ; and they went ofif, I suppose back, to ^ive an ac- 
count of the reception they were like to meet with ; and indeed that 
salute cloyed their stomachs, for they immediately halted, stood 
awhile to consider of it, and wheeling oflf to the left they gave over their 
design, and said no more to us for that time ; which was very agree- 
able to our circumstances, which were but very indifferent for a 
battle with such a number. 

Two days after we came to the city of Naun, or Naum ; we thanked 
the governor for his care of us, and collected to the value of a hundred 
crowns or thereabout, which we gave to the soldiers sent to guard 
us ; and here we rested one day. This is a garrison indeed, and 
there were nine hundred soldiers kept there : but the reason of it was, 
that formerly the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than they 
now do, the Muscovites having abandoned that part of the country 
which lies from this city west for about two hundred miles, as deso- 
late and unfit for use ; and more especially being so very remote^ and 
so difiicult to send troops thither for its defence ; for we were yet 
above two thousand miles from Muscovy, properly so called. 

After this we passed several great rivers and two dreadful des- 
erts ; one of which we were sixteen days passing over, and which, 
as I said, was to be called no man's land ; and on the 18th of April 
we came to the frontiers of the Muscovite dominions I think the 
first town, or fortress, whichever it may be called, that belonged to 
the Czar of Muscovy was called Arguna, being on the west side of 
the river Arguna. 

I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction that I was so soon 
arrived in, as I called it, a Christian country, or, at least, in a coun- 
try iroverned by Chrisslians ; for ih'iugji the Muscovites do, in my 
opinion, but just deserve the name of Christians, yet such they pre- 
tend to be, and are very devout in their way. It would certainly 
occur to any man who travels the world as I have done, and who had 
any power of reflection, what a blessing it is to be brought into the 
world where the name of God and a Redeemer is known, adored, 



374 BOBINSOK CRUSOE. 

and worshipped ; and not where the people, given up by Heaven to 
strong delusions, worship the devil, and prostrate themselves to 
stoclts and stones ; worship monsters, elements, horrid shaped anK 
mals, and statues or images of monsters. Not a town or city wc 
passed through but had their pagodas, their idols, and their temples, 
and ignorant people worshipping even the works of their own hands. 
Now w^e came where, at least, a face of the Christian worship ap- 
peared ; where the knee was bowed to Jesus ; and whether igno- 
raptly or not, yet the Christian religion was owned, and the name of 
the true God was called upon and adored ; and it made iny soul re- 
joice to see it. *I saluted the brave Scots merchant I mentioned above 
with my first acknowledgment of this ; and taking him by the hand 
I said to him, ** Blessed be God, we are once again among Chris- 
tians.** He smiled and answered, " Do not rejoice too soon, country- 
man ; these Muscovites are but an odd sort of Christians ; and but 
for the name of it you may see very little of the substance for some 
months farther of our journey/* **Well,** says I, "but still it is 
better than paganism and worshipping of devils.** "Why, I will 
tell you,'* says he ; ** except the Russian soldiers in the garrisons, 
and a few of the inhabitants of the cities upon the road, all the rest 
of this country, for above a thousand miles farther, is inhabited by 
the worst and most ignorant of pagans. '* And so, indeed, we found it. 

We were now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth, if I 
understand anything of the surface of the globe, that is to be found 
in any part of the world ; we had. at least, twelve thousand miles to 
the sea, eastward ; two thousand to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, 
westward ; and above three thousand, if we left that sea, and went 
on west, to* the British and French channels : we had full five thou- 
sand miles to the Indian or Persian Sea, south ; and about eight hun- 
dred to the Frozen Sea, north. Nay, if some people may be believed, 
there might be no sea north-east till we came round the Pole, and 
consequently into the north-west, and so had a continent of hmd into 
America, the Lord knows where ; though I could give some reasons 
why I believe that to be a mistake. 

As we entered into the Muscovite dominions a good while before 
we came to any considerable towns, we had nothing to observe there 
but this : first, that all the rivers run to the east ; as I understood by 
the charts, which some in our caravan had with them, it was plain 
all those rivers ran into the great river Yamour, or Gamour ; which 
river, by the natural course of it, must run into the East Sea or 
Chinese Ocean. The story thev tell us, that tha mouth of this river 
is choked up with bulrushes of a monstrous growth, viz., three feet 
about and twenty or thirty feet high, I must be allowed to say I be- 
lieve nothing of it ; but, as its navigation is of no use, because there 
is no trade that way, the Tartars, to whom it alone belongs^ dealing in 
nothing but cattle, so nobody that ever I heard of has been curious 
enough either to go down to the mouth of it in boats, or come up 



ROBIKSOK CRUSOE, 375 

from the mouth of it in ships, as far as I can find : but this is cer- 
tain^ that this river running east, in tlie latitude of about 50 degrees, 
carries a vast concourse of rivers along with it, and finds an ocean to 
empty itself in that latitude ; so we are sure of sea there. 

Some leagues to the north of this river there are several consider- 
able rivers, whose streams run as due north as the Yamour runs 
east ; and these are all found to join their waters with the great river 
Tartarus, named so from the northernmost nations of the Mogul 
Tartars ; who, as the Chinese say, were the first Tartars in the 
world ; and who, as our geographers allege, are the Gog and Magog 
mentioned in sacred history. These rivers running all northward, 
as well as all the other rivers I am yet to speak of, make it evident 
that the northern ocean bounds the lands also on that side ; so that it 
does not seem rational in the least to think that the land can extend 
itself to join with America on that side, or that tiiere is not a com- 
munication between the northern and eastern ocean ; but of this I 
shall say no more ; it was my observation at that time, and therefore 
I take notice of it in this place. 

We now advanced from the river Arguna by easy and moderate 
journeys, and were very visibly obliged to the care the Czar of Mus- 
covy has taken to have cities and towns built in as many places as it 
is possible to place them, where his soldiers keep garrison, some^ 
thing like the stationary soldiers placed by the Romans in the remotest 
countries of their empire ; some of -which 1 had read of were placed 
in Britain for the security of commerce and for the lodging of trav- 
ellers : and thus it was here ; for wherever we came, though at these 
towns and stations the garrisons and governors were Russians and 
professed Christians, yet the inhabitants were mere pagans, sacrificing 
to idols and worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or all the host of 
heaven ; and not only so, but were, of all the heathens and pagans 
that ever I met with, the most barbarous, except only that they did 
not eat men's flesh, as our savages •f America did. 

Some instances of this we met with in the country between Arguna, 
"Where we enter the Muscovite dominions, and a city of Tartars and 
Russians together, (galled I^ortziousky, in which is a continued desert 
or forest, which cost us twenty days to travel over. In a village near 
the last of these places, I had the curiosity to go and see their way 
of liviDg, which is most brutish and unsunerable. They had, I sup- 
pose, a great sacrifice that day ; for there stood out, upon an old 
stump of a tree, an idol made of wood, frightful as the devil ; at 
least, as anything we can think of to represent the devil can be 
made : it had a head not resembling any creature that the world ever 
saw ; ears as big as goats' horns, and as high ; eyes as big as a 
crown-piece ; a nose Tike a crooked ram's-horn, and a mouth ex- 
tended four-cornered, like that of a lion, with horrible teeth, hooked 
like a parrot's under bill ; it was dressed up in the filthiest manner 
that you could suppose ; its upper garment was of sheep-skins, with' 



376 B0BIN80N CRUSOE. 

the wool outward ; a great Tartar bonnet on the head, with two 
horns growing through it ; it was about eight feet high, yet had no 
feet or legs, nor any other proportion of parts. 

This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village ; and, 
when I came near to it^ there were sixteen or seventeen creatures — 
whether men or women I could not tell, for they made no distinction 
by their habits— all lying flat upon the ground round this formidable 
block of shapeless wood ; I saw no motion among them, any more 
than if they had been all logs of wood, like the idol, and at first I 
really thought they had been so ; but when I came a little nearer 
they started up upon their feet and raised a howling cry, as if it had 
been so many deep-mouthed hounds, and walked away, as if they 
were displeased at our disturbing them. A little way off from Ihe 
idol, and at the door of a tent or hut, made all of sheep-skins and 
cow-skins dried, stood three butchers — I thought they were such 
when I came nearer to them, for I found they had long knives in 
their hands ; and in the middle of the tent appeared three sheep 
killed, and one young bullock or steer. These, it seems, were sacii 
flees to that senseless log of an idol ; the three men -were priests be- 
longing to it, and the seventeen prostrated wretches were the people 
who brought the offering, and were making their prayers to that 
stock. 

I confess I was more moved at their stupidity and brutish worship 
of a hobgoblin than ever 1 was at anything in my life — to see God's 
most glorious and best creature, to whom he had granted so many 
advantages, even by creation, above the rest of tlie works of his 
hands, vested with a reasonable soul, and that soul adorned with 
faculties and capacities adapted both to honor his Maker, and be ' 
honored by him, sunk and degenerated to a degree so very stupid as 
toproslrate itself to a frightful nothing, a mere imaginary object, 
dressed up by themselves, and made terrible to themselves by their 
own contrivance, adorned only with clouts and rags — and that this 
should be the effect of mere ignorance, wrought up into hellish de- 
votion by the devil himself, who, envying his Maker the homage 
^nd adoration of his creatures, had deluded them into such sordid 
and brutish things as one would think would shock nature itself I 

But'What signified all the astonishment and reflection of thoughts ? 
And thus it was, and I saw it before my eyes, and there was no 
room to wonder^ at it, or think it impossible ; all my admiration 
turned to rage, and I rode up to the image or monster— call it what 
you will — and with my sword made a stroke at the bonnet that was 
on its head, and cut it in two ; and one of our men that was with me 
took hold of the sheep skin that covered it and pulled at it, when, 
behold, a most hideous outcry and howling ran through the villajje, 
and two or three hundred people came about my earsr^o that I was 
glad to scour for it, for we saw some had bows and arrows ; but I 
resolved from that moment to visit them again. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 377 

Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was about four 
miles off, in order to provide some horses which they wanted, several 
of the horses having been lamed and jaded with the badness of the 
way and long march over the last desert ; so we had some leisure 
here to put my design in execution. I communicated it to the Scots 
merchant of Moscow, of whose courage I had sufficient testiipony ; I 
told him what I had seen, and with what indignation 1 had since 
thought that human nature could be so degenerate ; I told him if I 
could get but four or five men well armed to go with me, 1 was re- 
solved to go and destroy that vile, abominable ic\ol, and let them see 
that it had no power to help itself, and consequently could not be an 
object of worship, or to. be prayed to, much less help them that 
offered sacrifices to it. 

He laughed at me : says he, " Your zeal may be good, but what 
do you propose to yourself by it ?" *' Propose !" said I, *' to vindi- 
cate the honor of God, which is insultefl by this devil-worship." 
** But how will it vindicate the honor of God," said he, " while the 
people will not be able to know what you mean by it, unless you 
could speak to them and tell them so ? and then they will fight you, 
and beat you, too, I assure you ; for they are desperate fellows, and 
that especially in defence of tneir idolatry." " Can we not," said 1, 
" do it in the night, and then leave them the reasons and the causes in 
writing in their own language ?" '* Writing !" said he ; ** why, there 
is not a man in five nations of them that knows anything of a letter, 
or how to read a word any way." *' Wretched ignorance !" said I 
to him ; " however, I have 4i great mind to do it ; nerhaps nature 
may draw inferences from it to them, to let them see how brutish they 
are to worship such horrid things." ** Look you, sir," said he; 
*' if your zeal prompts you to it so warmly, you must do it ; but, in 
the next place, I would have you consider these wild nations of peo- 
ple are subjected by force to the Czar of Muscovy's dominion ; and 
if you do this, it is ten to one but they will come by thousands to the 
governor of Nertsinskay and demand satisfaction ; and if he cannot 
give them satisfaction, it is ten to one but they revolt, and it will oc- 
Ciusion a new war with all tlie Tartars in the country." 

This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head for awhile ; but I 
harped upon the same string still : and all that day I was uneasy to 
put mypioject in execution. Toward the evening the Scots mer- 
chant met me by accident in our walk about the town, and desired to 
speak with me. ** I believe," said he, *'l have put you off vour 
good design. I have been a little concerned about it since, for I 
abhor idolatry as much as you can do." "Truly," said I, "you 
have put off a little the execution of it ; but you have not put it out 
of my thoughts, and I believe I shall do it before 1 quit this place, 
though I were to be delivered up to them for satisfaction." " No. 
no," said he ; " God forbid they should deliver you up to such a 
crew of monsters ! They shall not do that either ; that would bo

murdering you indeed." **Whv,'* said I, "how would they use 
me ?" ** Use you !" said he ; '* I'll tell you how they served a poor 
Russian who affronted them in their worship just as you did, and 
whom they took prisoner, after they had lamed him with an arrow 
that he could nut run away. They took him and stripped him stark 
naked, and set him upon the top of the idol monster, and stood all 
round him, and shot as many arrows into him as would stick over 
his whole body ; and then they burned him, and all the arrows stick- 
ing in him, as a sacrifice fo the idol.'* ** And was this the same 
idol?" said I. " Yes," said he, ** the very same." " Well," ^aid 
I, *' I will tell you a story." So I related the btory of our men dt 
Miulagascar, and how they burned and sacked the village there, and 
killed man, woman, and child, for their niurdering one o| our men, 
just as it is related before ; and I added that I thought we ought to 
do so to this village. 

He listened very attentively to the story ; but when I talked of 
doing so to that village, said he, *' You mistake very much ; it was 
not tbis village — it was almost a hundred miles from this place ; but 
it was the same idol, for they carry him about in procession all over 
the country." " Well, " said I, *' then that idol ought to be punished 
for it ; and it shall," said I, ** if I live this night out." 

In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the design, and told me I 
should not go alone, but he would go with me. but he would go first 
and bring a stout fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also with 
us ; •* and one," said he, ** as famous for his zeal as you can desire 
any one to be |gainst such devilish things as these." In a word, he 
brought me his comrade, a Scotsman, whom he called Captain Rich- 
ardson ; and I gave him a full account of what I had seen, and also 
what I intended ; and he told me readily he would go with me if it 
cost him his life. So we agreed to go — onljr we three. I had indeed 
proposed it to my partner, but he declined it. He said he was ready 
to assist me to the utmost, and upon all occasions, for my defence ; 
but this was an adventure quite out of his way ; so, I say, we re- 
solved upon our work, only we three and my man-servant, and to 
put it in execution that night about midhight, with all the secrecy 
imM^iqUfifeT'^. 

However^ upon second thoughts, we were willing to delay it till 
the next night, because the caravan being to set forward in the 
morning, we supposed the governor could not pretend to give them 
^ny satisfaction upon us when we were out of his power. The Scots 
merchant, as steady in his resolution for the enterprise as bold in ex- 
ecuting, brought me a Tartar's robe or gown of sheep- skins, and a 
bonnet, with a bow and arrows, and had provided the same for him- 
self and bis countryman, that the people, if they saw us, should not 
determine who we were. 

All the first night we spent in mixing up some combustible matter^ 
with aqua-vitae, gunpowder, and such other materials as we could 



ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 879 

get ; and having a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an liour 
after night we set out upon our expedition. 

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and found that 
the people had not the least jealousy of danger attending their idol. 
The night was cloudy ; yet the moon gave us light enough to see 
that the idol stood jjust in the same posture and place that it did be- 
fore. The people seemed to be all at their rest ; only that in the 
great hut, or tent, as we called it, where we saw the three piiesls, 
whom w^ mistook for butchers, we saw a'light, and going up close 
to the door we heard people talking as if there wei*e live or six of 
them ; we concluded, therefore, that if we set wildfire to the idul 
these men would come out immediately and run up to the place to 
rescue it from the destruction that we intended for it : and what to 
do with them we knew not. Once we thought of carrying it away 
and setting fire to it at a distance ; but when we came to handle it 
we found it too bulky for our carriage ; so we were at a loss again. 
The second Scotsman was for setting fire to the tent or hut, and 
knocking the creatures that were there on the head when they came 
out ; but I could not join with that ; I was against killing them, if 
it were possible to avoid it. *' Well, then," said the Scots merchant, 
*' I will tell you what we will do : we will try to make them pris- 
oners, tie their hands, and make them stand and see their idol de- 
stroyed." 

As it happened, we had twine or pack-thread enough about us. 
Which we used to tie our firelocks together with ; so we resolved to 
: ttack these people first, and with as little noise as we could. The 
first thing we did we knocked at the door, when one of the priests 
coming to it we immediately seized upon him, stopped his mouth, 
and tied his hands behind him, and led him to the idol, where we 
gauged him that he might not make a noise, tied his feet also together, 
and left him on the ground. 

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that another would 
come out to see what the matter was ; but we waited so long till the 
third man came back to us, and then nobody coming out we knocked 
again gently, and immediately out came two more, and we served 
them just in the same manner, but were obliged to go all with them 
and lay them down by the idol some distance from one another ; 
when, going back, we found two more were come out to the door, 
and a third stood behind them within the door. We seized the two, 
and immediately tied them, when the third, stepping back and cry- 
ing out, my Scots merchant went in after him, and taking out a com- 
position we had made that would only smoke and stink, he set fire 
to it and threw it in among them. By that time the other Scotsman 
and my man, taking charge of the two men already bound and tied 
together also by the arm, led them away to the idol and left them 
there, to see if their idol would relieve them, making haste back to us. 

When the furze we had thrown in had filled the hut with so much 



380 ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 

smoke that they were almost suffocated, we then threw in a small 
leather bag of another kind, which flamed like a candle, and follow- 
ing it in, we found there were but four people, and, as we sup- 
posed, had been about some of Iheir diabolic sacrifices. They ap- 
peared, in short, frightened to death, at least so as to sit trembling 
and stupid, and not able to speak eitlier for the smoke. 

In a word, we took Ihem, bound them as we had done the other, 
and all without any noise. I should have said we brought them out 
of the house or hut first : for indeed we were not able to bear the 
smoke any more than they were. When we »had done this" we car- 
ried them all together to the idol ; when we came there we fell, to 
work with him ; and first we daubed him all over, and his robes 
also, with tar, and such other stuff as we had, which was tallow 
mixed with brimstone ; then we stopped his eyes and ears and 
mouih full of gunpowder ; then we wrapped up a great piece of 
wildfire in his bonnet ; and then sticking all the combustibles we 
had brought with us upon him, we looked about to see if we could 
find anytliing else to help to burn him ; when ihy Scotsman remem- 
bered that by the tent or hut, wheje the men were, there lay a heap 
of diy forage, whether straw or rushes I do not remember ; away he 
and the other Scotsman ran and fetched their arms full of that. 
When we had done this, we took all our prisoners and brought 
them, having untied their feet and ungagged their mouths, and made 
them stand up, and set them before their monstrous idol, and then 
set fire to the whole. 

We staid by it a quarter of an hour or thereabout, till the powder 
in the eyes and mouth and ears of the idol blew up, and, as we 
could perceive, had split and deformed the shape of it ; and, in a 
word, till we saw it burned into a mere block or log of wood ; and 
setting dry forage to it we found it would be soon quite consumed ; 
so we began to think of going away ; but the Scotsman said, '* No, 
we must not go, for these poor deluded wretches will all throw 
themselves into the fire and burn themselves with the idol." So we 
resolved to stay till the forage was burned down too, and then came 
away and left them. 

After the feat was performed, we appeared in the morning among 
our fellow-travellers, exceedingly busy in getting ready for our 
journey ; nor could any man suggest that we had been anywhere hut 
m our beds, as travellers might be supposed to be, to fit themselves 
for tlie fatigues of the dixy*8 journey. 

But the affair did not end so ; the next day came a great number of 
the country people to the town gates, and in a most outrageous manner 
demanded satisfaction of the Russian governor for the insulting their 
priests and burning their great Cham Chi-Thaungu. The people of 
NertsiDskay were at first in a great consternation, for they said the 
Tartai's were already no less than thirty thousand strong. The Rus- 
sian governor sent out messengers to appease them, and gave them 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 381 

all the good words imaginable ; assuring them that he knew nothing 
of it, and that there had not a soul in his garrison been abroad, 
so that it could not be from anybody there : but if they could let him 
know who did it they should be exemplarily punished. They re- 
turned haughtily, that all the country reverenced 'the great Cham 
Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the sun, and no mortal would have dared 
to offer violence to his image but some Christian miscreant ; and they 
therefore resolved to denounce war against him and all the Russians, 
who, they said, were misci'eants and Christians. 

The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make a breach, or to 
have any cause of war alleged to be given by him, the Czar having 
strictly charged him to treat the conquered country with gentleness 
and civility, gave them still all the good words he could. At last he 
told them there was a caravan gone toward Russia that morning, and 
perhaps it was some of them who had done them this injury ; and 
that if they would be satisfied witli that he would send after them to 
inquire into it. This seemed to appease them a little ; and accord- 
ingly the governor sent after us, and gave us a particular account 
how the thing was ; intimating withal that if any in our caravan had 
done it, they should make their escape ; but that whether we had 
done it or no, we should make all the haste forward that was pos- 
sible ; and that in the mean time he would keep them in play as 
long as he could. 

This was very friendly in the governor ; however, when it came to 
the caravan there was nobody knew anything of the matter ; and as 
for us that were guilty, we were least of all suspected. However, 
the captain of the caravan for the time took the hint that the gov- 
ernor gave us, and we travelled two days and two nights without any 
considerable stop, and then we lay at a village called Plolhus : nor did 
we make any long stop here, but hastened on toward Jarawena, an- 
other of the Czar of Muscovy's colonies, and where we expected we 
should be safe. But upon the second day's march from Plotiius, by 
the clouds of dust behind us at a great distance, some of our people 
began to be sensible we were pursued. We had entered a great 
desert, and had passed by a great lake called Schaks Oser, when we 
perceived a very great body of horse appear on the other side of the 
lake, to the north, we travelling west. We observed they went away 
west, as we did, but had supposed we would have taken that side of 
the lake, whereas we very happily took the south side ; and in two 
days more they disappeared again : for they, believing we were still 
before them, pushed on till they came to the River Udda, a very great 
river when it passes farther north, but when we came to it we found 
it narrow and fordable. 

The third day they had either found their mistake or had intelli- 
gence of us, and came pouring in upon us toward the d^isk of the 
evening. We had, to our great satisfaction, just pitched upon a place 
for our camp, which was very convenient for the night ; for as we 



382 ROBINSOX CRUSOE. 

were upon a desert, though but at the beginning of it, that was above 
^ve hundred miles over, we had no towns to lodge at, and, indeed, 
expected none but the city Jarawena, which we had yet two days 
march to ; tlie desert, however, had some few woods in it on this 
side, and little rivers, wliicli ran all into the great River Udda ; it 
was in a narrow strait, between little but very thick woods, that we 
pitched our little cunp for that night, expecting to be attacked be- 
fore morning. 

Nobody knew but ourselves what w.e were pursued for : but as it 
was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go about in troops in that desert, 
so the caravans always fortify themselves every night against them, 
as against armies of robbers ; and it was, therefore, no new thing to 
be pursued. 

But we had this night, of all the nights of our travels, a most ad- 
vantageous camp ; for we lay between two woods, with a little rivu- 
let running just before our front, so that we could not be surrounded, 
or attacked any way but in our front or rear. We took care also to 
make our front as strong as we could, by placing our packs, with our 
camels and horses, all in a line, on the inside of the river, and felling 
some trees in our rear. 

In- this posture we encamped for the niffht ; but the enemy was 
upon us before we liad finished. They did not come on us like 
thieves, as we expected, but sent three messengers to us to demand 
the men to be delivered to them that had abused their priests and 
burned their god Cham Chi-Thaungu with fire, that they might bum 
them with fire ; and upon this, they said, they would go away, and 
do us no further harm, otherwise they would destroy us all. Our 
men looked very blank at this message, and began to stare at one an- 
other to see who looked with the most guilt in their faces ; but no- 
body was the word — nobody did it. The leader of the caravan sent 
word he was well assured that it was not done by any of our camp ; 
that we were peaceful merchants, travelling on our business ; that 
we had done no harm to them or to any one else ; and that, there- 
fore, they must look farther for their enemies who had injured them, 
for we were not the people ; so desired them not to disturb us, for if 
they did we should defend ourselves. 

They were far from being satisfied with this for an answer ; and a 
great crowd of them came running down in the morning, by break 
of day, to our camp ; but seeing us in such an unaccountable situ- 
ation, they durst come no farther than the brook in our froat, where 
they stood, and showed us such a number that indeed terrified us 
very much ; for those that spoke least of them spoke of ten thousand. 
Here they stood and looked at us awhile, and then setting up a great 
howl they let fly a crowd of arrows among us ; but we were well 
enough fortified for that, for we sheltered under our baggage, and I 
do not remember that one of us was hurt. 

Some time after this we saw them move a little to our right, andex' 



ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 383 

pecter! them od the re^r ; when a cunning fellow, a Cossack of Jara- 
wena, in the pay of the Muscovites, calling to the leader of the cara- 
van, said to him, " I'll go send all these people away to Siheilka." 
This was a city four or five days' journey at least to the right, -Bad 
rather behind us. So he takes "his bow and arrows, and 'getting on 
horseback he rides away from our rear directly, as it were back to 
Nertsinskay : after this he takes a great circuit about, and comes 
directly on the army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent express to 
tell them a long story that the people who had burned the Cham Chi- 
Thaungu were gone to Slheilka with a caravan of miscreants, as he 
called them — that is to say. Christians ; and that they had resolved 
to burn the god Schal-Isar, belonging to the Tongueses. 

As this fellow was himself a mere Tartar, and perfectly ^poke their 
laiiguage, he counterfeited so well that they all believed him, and 
away they drove in a most violent hurry to. Siheilka, which, it seems, 
was'flve davs' journey to the north ; and in less than three hours they 
were entirely out of our sight, and we never heard any more of them, 
nor whether they went to Siheilka or no. So we passed away safely 
on to Jarawena, where there was a garrison of Muscovites, and there 
we rested five days ; the caravan bemg exceedingly fatigued with the 
last day's hard march, and with want of rest in the night. 

From this city we had a frightful desert, which held us twenty- 
three days' march. We furnished ourselves with some tents here, 
for the better accommodating ourselves in the night ; and the leader 
of the caravan procured sixteen carriages or wagons of the country 
for carrying our water or provisions ; and these carriages were our 
defence every night round our little camp ; so that had the Tartars 
appeared, unless they had been very numerous indeed, they would 
not have been able to hurt us. 

We may well be sjipposed to have wanted rest agiiin after this Joog 
journey ; for in this desert we neither saw house nor tree, and scarce 
a bush ; though we saw abundance of the sable hunters, who are all 
Tartars of the^Mogul Tartary, of which this country is a part ; and 
they frequently attack small caravans, but we saw no numbers of 
them together. 

After we had pjissed this desert we came mto a cotmtry pretty 
well inhabited ; that is to say, we found towns and castles, settled by 
the Czar of Muscovy, with garrisons of stationary soldiers to protect 
the cai-avans and defend the country against the Tartars, who would 
otherwise make it very dangerous travelling ; and his Czarish majesty 
has given such strict orders for the well guarding the caravans and 
merchants that if there are any Tartars heard of in the country, de- 
tachments of the garrison are always sent* to see the travellers safe 
from station to station. And thus the governor of Adinskoy — whom 
I had an opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the Scots mer- 
chant, who was acquainted with him — offered us a guard of fifty 
men, if we thought there was any danger, to the next station. 



384 ROBIKSON CEUSOB. 

I thought long hefore this, that as we came nearer to Europe wa 
should find the country better inhabited and the people more civil^ 
izeii ; but I found myself mistak(^n in both ; for we liad yet the na 
tion of the Tongueses to pass through, where we saw the same tokens 
of paganism and barbarity as before ; only, as tliey were conquered 
by the Muscovites, they were not so dangerous, but for rudeness of 
manners and idolatry no people in the world ever went beyond 
them ; they are clothed all in skins of beasts, and their houses are 
built of the same ; you know not a man from a woman, neither by 
the ruggedness of their countenances nor their clothes ; and in the 
winter, when the ground is covered with snow, they live under- 
ground in vaults, which have cavities going from one to another. 

If the Tartars had their Cham Chi-Thaungu for a whole village or 
country, these bad idols in every hut and every cave : besides, Ihev 
worship the stars, the sun, the water, the snow, and, in a wora, 
everything they do not understand, and they understand but verjr 
little ; so that every element, every uncommon thing, sets them sacri- 
ficing. I met with nothing peculiar myself in all this country, which 
I reckon was, from the desert 1 spoke of last, at least four hundred 
miles, half of it being another desert, which took us up twelve days' 
severe travelling, without house or tree ; and we were obliged again 
to carry our own provisions, as well water as bread. After we were 
out of this desert, and had travelled two daj- s, we came to Janezay, a 
Muscovite city or station on the great River Janezay, whidi, they 
told us there, parted Europe from Asia. 

Here I observed. ignorance and paganism still prevailed, except in 
the Muscovite garrisons. AH the country between the River Oby 
and the River Janezay is as entirely pagan, and the people as barbar- 
ous, as the remotest of the Tartars ; nay, as any nation, for aught I 
know, in Asia or America. I also found, which I observed to the 
Muscovite governors whom I had an opportunity to converse with, 
that the poor pagans are not much wiser or nearer Christianity for 
being under the Muscovite government, which they ack no wedged 
was true enough ; but that, as they said, was none of their business ; 
that if the Czar expected to convert his "Siberian, Tonguese, or Tar- 
tar subjects, it should be done by sending cler^men among them, 
not soldiers ; and they added, with more sincerity than I expected, 
that they found it was not so much the concern of their monarch to 
make the people Christians as it was to make them subjects. 

From this river to the great River Oby we crossed a wild, unculti- 
vated country, barren of people and good management ; otherwise it 
is in itself a most pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country. What 
inhabitants we found in it are all pagans, except such as are sent 
among them from Russia ; for this islhe country — I mean on both 
sides the River Oby — whither the Muscovite criminals that are not 
put to death are banished, and from whence it is next to impossible 
they should ever get away. 






ROBINSON CRfSOE. 385 

I have nothing material to say of my particular affairs till I came 
to Tobolski, the capital city of Siberia, where I continued some time 
on the following account. 

We had now been almost seven months on our journey, and winter 
began to come on apace ; whereupon my partner and I called a 
council about our particular affairs, in which we found it proper, as 
we were bound for Englaud, and not for Moscow, to consider how t'» 
dispose of ourselves. They told us of sledges and reindeer to carry 
us over the snow in the winter-time ; and, indeed, they have such 
things that it would be incredible to relate the particulais of, by 
which means the Russians travel more in winter than they can in 
summer, as in these sledges they are able to run night and aay ; the 
snow, being frozen, is one universal covering to nature, by which the 
hills, vales, rivers, and lakes arc all smooth and hard as a stone, and 
they run upon the surface, without any regard to what is underneath. 

But I had no occasion to urge a winter journey of this kind : I was 
bound to England, not to Moscow, and my route lay two ways: 
either I must go on as the caravan went, till 1 came to Jaroslaw, and 
then go off west for Narva and the Gulf of Finland, and so on to 
Dantzic, where I might possibly sell my China cargo to good ad- 
vantage ; or I must leave the caravan at a little town on the Dwina, 
from whence I had but six days by water to Archangel, and from 
thence might be sure of shipping either to England, Holland, or 
Hamburg. 

Now, to go any of these journeys in the winter would have been 
preposterous ; for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would have been frozen 
up, and I could not get passage ; and to go by land in those countries 
was far less safe than among the Mogul Tartars ; likewise, to go to 
Archangel in October, all the ships would be gone from thence, and 
even the merchants who dwell there in summer retire south to Mos- 
cow in the winter, when the ships are gone ; so that 1 could have 
nothing but extremity of cold to encounter, witli a scarcity of pro- 
▼ii^ions, and must lie in an empt^ town all the winter ; so that, upon 
the whole, I thought it much my better way to let the caravan go, 
and make provision to winter where I was, at Tobolsk!, in Siberia, 
in the latitude of about sixty degrees, where I was sure of three * 
things to wear out a cold winter with, viz., plenty of provisions, such 
as the country afforded, a warm house, with fuel enough, and excel- 
lent company. 

I was now in quite a different climate from my beloved island, 
where I never felt cold, except when I had my ague ; on the con- 
trary, I had much to do to bear any clothes on my back, and never 
ihaae any Are but without doors, which was necessary for dressing 
my food, etc. Now I had three good vests, with large robes or gowns 
over them, to hang down to the feet and button close to the wrists ; 
and all these lined with furs, to make them sufficiently warm. 

As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly disliked our way io

cold as the climate ; hut taking an apartment in a good house iu the 
town, I ordered a chimney to be built like a furnace, in the centre of 
six several rooms,- like a stove ; the funnel to carry the smoke went 
up one way, the door to come at the fire went in another, and all the 
rooms were kept equally warm, but no lire seen, just as they heat the 
■•bagnios in England. By this means we had always the same climate 
in all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved ; and how cold 
soever it was without, it was always warm within ; and yet we saw 
BO fire, nor were ever incommoded with smoke. 

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be possible to 
meet with good company here, in a country so barbarous as that of 
the most northerly parts of Europe, near the Frozen Ocean, within 
but a very few degrees of Nova Zembla. But this being the country 
where the state criminals of Muscovy, as I observed before, arc all 
banished, this city was full of nobkmen, gentlemen, soldiers, and 
courtiers of^Muscovy. Here was the famous Prince Galitzin, the old 
General Roboatiski, and several other persons of note, and some 
ladies. By means of my Scotch merchant, whom, nevertheless, I 
parted with here, I made an acquaintance with several of these gentle- 
men ; and from these, in the long winter nights jn which 1 staid 
here, I received several very agreeable visits. 

It was talking one night with Prince , one of the banished 

ministers of state belonging to the Czar of Muscovy, that the jdis- 
course of my particular case began. He had l)een telling me abun- 
dance of fine things of the greatness, the magnificence, the dominions, 
and the absolute power of thcEmpeior of the Russians : I interrupted 
him, and told him I was a greater and more powerful priucb than 
ever the Czar of Muscovy was, though my dominions were not so 
large or my people so many. The Russian grandee looked a little 
surprised, and, fixing his eyes steadily upon me, began to wonder 
what I meant. I told him his wonder would cease when I had ex- 
plained myself. First, I told him I had absolute disposal of the lives 
and fortunes of all my subjects ; that notwithstanding my absolute 
power I had not one person disaffected to my government or to my 
person in all my dominions. He shook his head at that, and said, 
there, indeed, I outdid the Czar of Muscovy. I told him that all the 
lands in my kingdom were my own, and all my subjects were not 
only my tenants but tenants at will ; that they would all fight for 
me to the last drop : and that never tyrant (for such I acknowledged 
myself to be) was ever so universally beloved and yet so horribly 
feared by his subjects. 

After amusing him with these riddles in government for a while, I 
r peued the case and told him the story at large of my living in the 
Island, and how I managed both myself and the people that were un- 
der me, just as I have since minuted it down. They were exceed-

in.^ taken with the story, apd especially the prince, who told me, 
with a sigh, that the true greatness of life was to be masters of our- 
selves ; that he would not have exchanged such a state of life as mine 
to be Czar of Muscovy ; and that he found more felicity in the retire- 
ment ho seemed to be banished to there than ever he found iu the 

^ highest authority he enjoyed in the court of his master the Czar ; 

J • that the height of human wisdom was to bring our tempers down lo 
our circumstances, and to make a calm within under the weighf. of the 
greatest storms without. When he came first hither, he said he used 
to tear the hair from his head and the clothes from his back, as otb l 
ers had done before, him ; but a little time and consideration haa 
made him look into himself, as well as round him, to things with- 
out : that he found the mind of man, if it was but once brought lo 
reflect upon the state of universal life, and how little this world was 
concerned in its true felicity, was perfectly capable of making a 
felicity for itself, fully satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own 
best ends and desires, with but very little assistance from the world ; 
the air to breathe in, food to sustain life, clothes for warmth, and lib- 
erty for exercise, in order to health, completed, in his opinion, all 
that the world could do for us ; and though the greatness, the 
authority, the riches, and the pleasures which some enjoyed in the 
world had much in them that was agreeable to us, yet all those things 
chiefly gratified the coarsest of our affections, such as our ambition, 
our particular pride, avarice, vanity, and sensuality ; all which, be- 
ing the mere product of the worst part of man, were in themselves 
crimes, and had in them the seeds or all manner of crimes ; but nei- 
ther were related to nor concerned with any of those virtues that 
constituted us wise men, nor of those graces that distinguished us as 
Christians ; that being now deprived or all the fancied felicity which 
he enjoyed in the full exercise of all those vices, he said he was at 
leisure to look upon the dark side of them, where he found all man- 
ner of deformity ; and was ,now convinced that virtue only makes a 
man tnily wise, rich, amd great, and preserves him in the way to a 
. superior happiness in a future state ; and in this, he said, they were 
more happy in their banishment than all their enemies were, who 
had the full possession of all the wealth and power they had left be- 
hind them. ** Nor, sir," says he, " do I bring my mind to this polite ^ 
ically, from the necessity oi my circumstances, which some call mis- * 
erable ; but, if I know anything of myself, I would not now go back, v 
though the Czar my master should call me and reinstate me in all 
my former grandeur ; I say I would no more go back to it than I be 
lieve my soul, when it shall be delivered from this prison of the 
body, and has had a taste of the glorious state beyond life, would come 
• back to the jail of flesh and blood it is now inclosed in, and leave 
heaven, to deal in the dirt and crime of human affairs. 

He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, so much 
earnestness and motion of his spirits, that it was evident it was the 



388 TtOBINSON CRUSOE. 

tnie sense of his soul ; there was no room to doubt his sincerity. I 
told him I once thought myself a kind of monarch in my 
old station, of which 1 had given him an account, but that I 
thought he was not only a monarch, but a great conqueror ;. for 
he that had got a victory over his own exorbitant desires, and the ab- 
soiute dominion over himself, he whose reason entirely governs his 
will, is certainly greater than he that conquers a city. "But, mv 

I lord," said I, ** shall I take the liberty to ask you a question? 
*' With all my heart/* says he. ** If the door of ^our liberty was 
opened," said I, ** would you not take hold of it to deliver yourself 
fiom this exile ?" " Hold," said he ; ** your question is subtle, and 
requires some serious, lust distinctions to give it a sincere answer ; 
and 1 will give it you from the bottom of my heart. Nothing that I 
know of in the world would move me to deliver myself from this 
state of banishment, except these two : first, the enjoyment of my re- 
lations ; and, secondly, a little warmer climate ; but 1 protest to you, 
that to go back to the pomp of the court, the glory, the power, the 
hurry of a minister of state ; the wealth, the gayety, and the pleas- 
ures of a courtier ; if my master should send me wqid this moment 
that he restores me to all he banished me from, I protest, if I know 
myself at all, I would not leave this wilderness, these deserts, and 
these frozen lakes, for the palace at Moscow." "But, my lord,*' 
said I, " perhaps you not only are banished from the pleasures of the 
court, and from the power, authoiity, and wealth you enjoyed be- 
fore, ^ut you may be absent, too, from some of the conveniences of 

-life : your estate, perhaps, confiscated, and your effects plundered ; 
and the supplies left you here may not be suitable to the oidinary de- 
mands of life/* *' Ay,*' says he, ^* that is as you suppose me to be .a 
lord, or a prince, etc. ; so indeed I am ; but you are now to consider 
me only as a man, a human creature, not at all distinguished from 
another ; and so I can suffer no want unless 1 should be visited with 
sickness and distempers. However, to put the question out of dis- 
pute, you see our way of life : we are, in this place, five persons pf 
rank ; we live perftctly retired, as suited to a state of banishment ; 
we have something rescued from the shipwreck of our fortunes, 
which keeps us from the mere necessity of hunting for our food ; but 
the poor soldiers, who are here without that help, live in as muck 
plenty as we, who go into the woods and catch sables and foxes ; the 
labor of a month will maintain them a year ; and as the way of liv- 
ing is not expensive, so it is not hard to get sufficient for ourselves. 
So that objection is out of doors.** 

I have not room to give a full account of the most agreeable con- 
versation I had with this truly great man ; in all which he showed 
that his mind was so inspired with a sux>erior knowledj>e of things, 
so supported by religion, as well as by a vast ahare of wisdom, that 
bis contempt of the world was really as much as he had expressed. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 389 

and that he was always the same to the last, as will appear in the 
story I am going to tell. 

I had b«en here eight months, and a dark, dreadful winter I 
thought it ; the cold so intense that I could not so much as look 
abroad without being wrapped in furs, and a mask of fur before me 
face, or rather a hood, with only a hole for breath, and two for 
sight : the little davlight we had was, as we reckoned, for three 
months not about nve hours a day, and six at most ; only that the 
snow lying on the ground continually, and the weather being clear, it 
was never quite dark. Our horses were kept, or rather starved, un- 
der ground ; and as for our servants, whom we hired here to look 
after ourselves and horses, we had, every now and then, their fingers 
and toes to thaw and take care of, lest they should mortify and fall 
off. . 

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses being close, the 
walls thick, the lights small, and the glass all double. Our food was 
chiefly the flesh of deer, dried and cured in the season ; bread good 
enough, but baked as biscuits ; dried fish of several sorts, and scwic 
flesh of mutton and of buflfaloes, which is pretty good meat. All 
the stores of provisions for the winter are laid up iu the summer, and 
well cured : our drink was water mixed with aqua- vitro instead of 
brandy ; and for a treat, mead instead of wine, which, however, 
• they have very good. The hunters, who venture abroad all weath- 
ers, frequently brought us in fine venison, and sometimes bear's 
flesh, but we aid not much care for the last. We had a good stock 
of tea, with which we treated our friends, and we lived very cheer- 
fully and well, all things considered. 

It was now March, the days grown considerably longer, and the 
weather at least tolerable ; so the other travellers began to prepare 
sledges to carry them over the snow, and to get things ready to be 
going ; but my measures being fixed, as I have said, for Archangel, 
and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I made no motion, knowing very 
well that the ships from the south do not set out for that part of the 
world till May or June, and that if I was there ])y the beginning of 
August it would be as soon as any ships would be ready to go away ; 
and therefore I made no haste to be gone, as others did : in a word, 
I saw a great many people, nay, all the travellers, go away befoi'c 
me. It seems every year they go from thence to Muscovj' for trade, 
to carry furs and buy necessaries, which they bring back with them j 
to furnish their shops : also others went on the same errand to Arch-^ 
angel ; but then they, all bein^ to come back again above eight hun- 
dred miles, went out before me. 

In the month of May I began to make all ready to pack up ; and 
as I was doing this it occurred to me that, seeing all these people 
were banished by the Czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet, when 
they came there were left at lilHjrty to go whither they woiild, why 
they did not then go away to any part of the world, wherever they 



390 ROBIKSOK CRUSOE, 

thought fit : and I began to examine what should hinder them from 
making such an attempt. But my wonder was over when I entered 
upon that subject with the person I have mentioned, who answered 
me thus. ** Consider, first, sir," said he, *' the place where we are ; 
and, secondly, the condition we are in, especially the generality of the 
people who are banished hither. We are surrouuded with stronger 
things than bars or bolts ; on the north side an unnavigable ocean, 
where ship never sailed and boat never swam ; every other way we 
have above a thousand miles to pass through the Czar's owu dominions, 
and by ways utterly impassable except by the roads made by ihe gov- 
ernment and through the towns garrisoned by his troops ; so that 
we could neither pass undiscovered by the road nor subsist any 
other way ; so that it is in vain to attempt it." 

I was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that they were in a 
prison every jot as secure as if they had bten locked up in the castle 
at Moscow : however, it came into my thoughts that I might certainly 
be made an instrument to procure the escape of this excellent pei^on ; 
and that, whatever hazard I ran, I would certainly tiy if I could carry 
him off. Upon this, I look an occasion one evening to tell him my 
thoughts. I represented to him that it was very easy for me to carry 
him away, there being no guard over him in the country ; and as I 
was not going to Moscow, but to Archangel, and tliat I went in the 
retinue oi a caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in the station- 
ary towns in the 4esert, but could encamp every night where I 
would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to Archangel, where I 
would immediately secure him on board an English ship, and carry 
him safe along with me ; and as to his subsistence and other particu- 
lars, it should be my care till he could better supply himself. 

He heard mo very attentively, and looked earnestly on me all the 
while I^spoke ; nay, I could see in his very face that what I said put 
bis spirits into an exceeding ferment ; his color frequently changed, 
his eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered till it might be even per- 
ceived in his countenance ; nor could he immediately answer me 
when I had done, and, as it were, hesitated what he would say to it ; 
but after he had paused a little he embraced me, and said, ** How 
unhappy are we, unguarded creatures as we arc, (hat even our great- 
est acts of friendship are made snares unto us, and we are made 
tempters of one another 1 My dear friend," said he, ** your offer is 
so sincere, has such kindness in it, is so disinteiested in itself, and is 
^o calculated for my advantage, that I must have very little knowl- 
edge of the world if I did not both wonder at it and acknowledge 
the obligation I have upon me to you for it. But did j'ou believe I 
was sincere in what I have often said to you of my contempt of the 
world ? Did you believe I spoke my very soul to you, and that I 
had really obtained that degree of felicity here that had placed me 
above all that the world could give me ? Did you believe I was sincere 
when I told you I would not go back if I was recalled even to be all 



BOBIKSON CRUSOE. 391 

that I once was in the court, with the favor of the Czar my master? 
Did you believe me, my friend, to be an honest man ; or did you be- 
lieve me to be a boasting hypocrite ?" Here he stopped, as if he 
would hear what I would sa}'" ; but, indeed, I soon after perceived 
that he stopped because his spirits were in motion, his great heart 
was full of struggles, and he could not go on. I was, I confess, as- 
tonished at the thing as well as at the man, and I used some argu- 
ments with him to urge him to set himself free ; that he ought to look 
upon this as a door opened by Heaven for his deliverance, and a 
summons by Providence, who has the care and disposition of all 
events, to do himself good, and to render himself useful in the world. 

He had by this time recovered himself. '* How do you know, sir," 
says he warmly, " but that, instead of a summons from Heaven, it 
may be a feint of another instrument, representing in alluring colors 
to me the show of felicity as a deliverance, which may in itself b'q 
my snare, and tend directly to my ruin ? Here I am free from the 
temptation of returning to my former miserable greatness ; there I 
am not sure but that sdl the seeds of pride, ambition, avarice, and 
luxury, which I know remain in nature, may revive and take root, 
and, in a word, again overwhelm me ; and then the happy prisoner , 
whom you see now master of his soul's liberty shall be the miserable 
slave of his own senses, in the full enjoyment of all personal liberty. 
Dear sir, let me remain in this blessed confinement, banished from 
the crimes of life, rather than purchase a show of freedom at the ex- 
pense of the liberty of my reason, and at the future happiness which 
I now have in my view, but shall then, I fear, quickly lose sight of ; 
for 1 am but flesh ; a man, a mere man ; have passions and affections 
as likely to possess and overthrow me as any man : oh, be not my 
friend and tempter both together !'* 

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and stood silent, 
looking at him, and, indeed, admiring what i saw. The struggle in 
his soul was so great that, though the weather was extremely cold; 
it put him into a most violent sweat, and I found he wanted to give 
vent to his mind ; so I said a word or two, that I would leave him to 
consider of it and Wait on him again, and then I withdrew to my own 
apartment. 

About two hours after I heard somebody at or near the door of my 
room, and I was going to open the door ; but he bad opened it and . 
come in. " My dear friend," says he, " you had almost overset me, | 
but I am recovered. Do not take it ill that I do not close with your*^ 
offer. I assure you it is not for want of sense of the kindness of it in 
you ; and I came to make the most sincere acknowledgment of it to 
you ; but I hope I have got the victory over myself." . '* My lord," 
said I, " I hope you are fully satisfied that you do not resist the call 
of Heaven." "Sir," said he, " if it had be.en from Heaven, the 
same power would have influenced me to have accepted it ; but I 
hope and am fully satisfied that it is from Heaven that I decline it, 



393 KOBINSON CRUSOE. 

and I have infinite satisfaction in the parting, that you shall leave me 
un honest man still, though not a free man." 

I had nothing to do but to acquiesce and make professions to him 
of ray having no end in il but a sincere desire to serve him. He em- 
braced me very passionately, and assured me he was sensible of that, 
and should always acknowledge it ; and with that he offered me a 
very fine present of sables — too much, indeed, for me to accept from 
a man in his circumstances, and I would have avoided them, but he 
would not be refused. 

The next morning I sent my servant to his lordship with a small 
present of tea and two pieces of China damask, and four little 
wedges of Japan gold, which did not all weigh above six ounces or 
thereabout, but were far short of the value of his sables, which, when 
I came to England, I found worth near two hundred pounds. He 
accepted the tea and one piece of the damask, and one of the pieces 
of gold, which had a fine stamp upon it, of the Japan coinage, whicli 
I found he took for the rarity of it, but would not take any more ; 
and he sent word by my servant that he desired to speak with me. . 

When I came to him he told me I knew what had passed between 
us, and hoped I would not move him any more in that affair ; but 
that since I had made such a generous offer to him, he asked me if I 
had kindness enough to offer the same to another person that he 
would name to me, m whom he had a great share of concern. I told 
him that I could not say I inclineil to do so much for any but him- 
self, for whom I had a particular value, and should have been glad to 
have been the instrument of his deliverance ; however, if he would 
"please to name the person to me I would give liim my answer. He 
told me it was his only son, who, though I had not seen him, yet was 
in the same condition with hinlself, and above two hundred miles 
from him, on the other side of the Oby ; but that if I consented he 
would send for him. 

I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. I made some 
ceremony in letting him understand that*it was wholly on his ac- 
count ; and that, seeing I could not prevail on him, I would show my 
respect to him by my concern for his son ; but these things are too 
tedious to repeat here. He sent the next day for his son, and in about 
twenty days he came back with the messenger, bringing six or seven 
horses, loaded with very rich furs, which, in the whole, amounted to 
a very great value. Hfs servants brought the horses into the town, 
but left the young lord at a distance till night, when he came incog- 
nito into our apartment, and his father presented him to me ; and, in 
short, we concerted the manner of our travelling, and everything 
proper for the journey. 

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black fox skins, 
fine ermines, and such other furs as are very rich in that city, in ex- 
change for some of the goods I had brought from C^ina ; in particu- 
lar for the cloves and nutmegs, of which I sold the greatest part here, 



( 



ROBIKSOl^ CRUSOE* 393 

and the rest afterward at Archangel, for a much better price than I 
could have got at London ; and my partner, who was sensible of the 
profit, and whose business, more particularly than mine, was mer- 
chandise, was mightily pleased with our stay on account of the traflic 
we made here. 

It was the beginning of June when I left this remote place ; a city, 
I believe, little heard of in the world ; and, indeed, it is so far out of 
the road of commerce that I know not how it should be much talked 
of. We were now reduced to a very small caravan, having only 
thirty-two horses and camels in all, ana all of them passed for mine, 
though my new guest was proprietor of eleven of them ; it was most 
natural also that I should take more servants with me than I had be- 
fore ; and the young lord passed for my steward ; wliat great man I 
passed for myself I know not, neither did it concern me to inquire. 
We had here the worst and the largest desert to pass over that we 
met with in our whole journey ; I call it the worst because the waj*" 
was very deep in some places and very uneven in others ; the best 
we had to say for il^was that we thought wo had no troops of Tar- 
tars or robbers to fear, and that they never came on this side the 
River Oby, or at least very seldom ; but we found it otherwise. 

My young lord had a faithful Siberian servant, who was perfectly 
acquainted with the country, and led us by private roads, so that.we 
avoided coming into the principal towns and cities upon the great 
road, such as Tumen, Soloy, Kamskoi, and several others ; becausiB 
the Muscovite garrisons which are kept there are very curious and 
strict in their observation upon travellers, and searching lest amy of 
the banished persons of note should make their escape that way intq 
Muscovy ; but, by this means, as we were kept out of the cities, so 
our whole journey was a desert, and we were obliged to encamp and 
lie in our tents, when we might have had very good accommodation 
in the cities on the way ; Uiis the young lord was so sensible of that 
he would not allow us to Im^Uu^d when we came to several cities on 
the way, but lay abroad himsen, with his servant, in the woods, and 
met us always at the appointed gla^^i^ 

We had just entered Europe, mmag passed"fhe River Kama, which 
in these parts is the boundary^ between Europe and Asia, and the first 
city on the European side was called Soloy Kamskoi, which is as 
much as to say the great city on the River Kama ; and here we 
thought to see some evident alteration in the people ; but we were 
mistaken ; for as we had a vast desert to pass, which is near seven 
hundred miles long in some places, but not above two hundred miles 
over where we passed it, so till we came past that horrible place we 
found very little difference between that country and the Mogul Tar- 
tary : the people are mostly pagans, and little better than the savages 
of America ; their houses and towns full of idols, and their way of 
living wholly barbarous, except in the cities, and the villages neat* 
them, where they are Christians, as they call themselves, of the 



394 ROBINSOK CRUSOE, 

Greek Church ; but have their religion mingled with so many relics 
of superstition that it is scarce to be known in some places from 
mere sorcery and witchcraft. 

In passing this forest I thought, indeed, we must (after all our 
dangers were, to our imaffinalion, escaped) have been plundered and 
robbed, and perhaps murdered, by a troop of thieves ; of what coun- 
try they were I am yet at a loss to know ; but they were all on 
horseback, carried bows and arrows, and were at first about forly- 
five in number ; they came so near to us as to be within two musket- 
shots, and, asldng no questions, surrounded us with their horses, and 
looked very earnestly upon us twice ; at length they placed them- 
selves just in our way ; upon which we drew up in a little line, be- 
fore our camels, being not above sixteen men in all ; and, being 
drawn up thus, we halted, and sent out the Siberian servant, who at- 
tended his lord, to see who they were ; his master was the more will- 
ing to let him go because he was not a little apprehensive that they 
were a Siberian troop sent out after him. The man came up nearer 
them with a flag of truce, and called to them ; 'but though he spoke 
several of their languages, or dialects of languages rather, he could 
not understand a word they said ; however, after some signs to him 
not to come near them at his peril, the fellow came back no wiser 
than he went ; only that by their dress, he said, he believed them to 
be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Circassian hordes, and that 
there must be more of them upon the great desert, though he never 
heard that any of them were seen so far north before. 

About an hour after, they again made a motion to attack us, and 
jode round our little wood to see where they might break in ; but 
finding us always ready to face them they went off again ; and we 
resolved not to stir for that night. 

This was small comfort to us ; however, we had no remedy ; there 
was, on our left hand, at about a quarter of a mile distance, a little 
grove, and very near the road ; I inunediately resolved we should 
advance to those trees and fortify ourselves as well as we could 
there ; for, first, I considered that the trees would in a great measure 
cover us from their arrows ; and, ift the next place, they could not 
come to chai'ge us in a body ; it was, indeed, my old Portuguese 
pilot who proposed it, and who had this excellency attending him, 
that he was always readiest and most apt to direct and encourage us 
in cases of the most danger. We advanced immediately, with what 
speed we could, and gained that little wood ; the Tartars, or thieves 
— ^for we knew not what to call them — keeping their stand and not at- 
tempting to hinder us. When we came thuher, we found, to our 
great satisfaction, that it was a sWampy piece of ground, and on the 
one side a very great spring of water, which, running out in a little 
brook, was a little farther Joined by another of the like size ; and 
was, in short, the source of a considerable river, called afterward the 
Wirtska ; the trees which grew about this spring were not above two 



-^•k2

hundred, but very large, and stood pretty thick, so that as soon as 
"we got in we saw ourselves perfectly safe from the enemy unless 
they attacked us on foot. 

While we staid here waiting the motion of the enemy some 
hours, without perceiving that they made any movement, our 
Portuguese, with some help, cut several arms of trees half off, and 
laid them hanging across from one tree to another, and in a manner 
fenced us in. About two hours before night they came down 
directly upon us ; and though we had not perceived it, we found 
they had been joined by some more, so that they were near fourscore 
horse ; whereof, however, we fancied some were women. They 
came on till they were within half-shot of our little wood, when we 
fired one musket without ball, and called to them in the Russian 
tongue to know what they wanted, and bade them keep off ; but they 
came on with a double fury up to the wood side, not imagining we 
were so barricaded that they could not easily break in. Our old 
pilot was our captain as well as our engineer, and desired us not to 
fire upon them till they came within pistol-shot, that we might bo 
sure to kill, and that when we did fire we should be sure to take good 
aim ; we bade him give the word of command, which he delayed so 
long that they were some of them within two pikes' length of us 
wfaen we let fly. We aimed so true that we killed fourteen of them 
and wounded several others, as also several of their horses, for we 
had all of us loaded our pieces with two or thitje bullets at least. 

They were terribly surprised with our fire, and retreated immedi- 
ately about one hundred rods from us ; in which time we loaded our 
pieces again, and seeing them keep that distance we sallied out, and 
caught four or five of their horses, whose riders we supposed were 
killed ; and coming up to the dead, we judged they were Tartars, 
but knew not how they came to make an excursion such an unusual 
length. 

We slept little, you may Ije sure, but spent the most part of the 
night in strengthening our situation and barricading the entrances 
into the wood and keeping a strict watch. We waited for daylight, 
and when it came it gave us a very unwelcome discovery indeed ; 
for the enemy, who we thought were discouraged with the reception 
they met with, were now greatly increased, and had set up eleven or 
twelve huts or tents, as if they were resolved to besiege us ; and this 
\ little camp they had pitched upon the open plain, about three quar- 
ters of a mile jfrom us. We were indeed surprised at tbis discovery ; 
and now, I confess, I gave myself over for lost, and all that I had ; 
the loss of my effects did not lie so near me, though very consider- 
able, as the thoughts of falling into the hands of such barbarians, at 
the latter end of my journey, after so many difficulties and hazards 
as I had gone through, and even in sight of our port, where we ex- 
pected safety and deliverance. As to my partner, he was raging, 
and declarea that to lose his goods would be his ruin, and that he

would rather die than be starved, and he was for fighting to the last 
drop. 

The young lord, a gallant youth, was for fighting to the last also ; and 
my old pilot was of opinion that we were able to resist them all in the 
situation we were then in ; and thus we spent the day in debates of what 
we should do ; but toward evening we found that the number of pur 
enemies still increased, and we did not know but by the' morning they 
might still be a greater number : so I began to inquire of those people 
we had brought from Tobolsk!, if there were no private ways by which 
we might avoid them in the night, and perhaps retreat to some town^ 
or get help to guard us over the desert. The Siberian, who was ser- 
vant to the young lord, told us, if we designed to avoid them, and 
not fight, he would engage to carry us off in the night to a way that 
went north, toward the River Petrou, by which he made no ques- 
tion but we might get away and the Tartars never discover it ; but, 
he said, his lord had told lam he would not retreat, but would rather 
choose to fight. I told him lie mistook his lord ; for that he was too 
wise a man to love fighting for the sake of it ; that I knew his lord 
was brave enough, by what he had showed already ; hut that his lord 
knew better than to desire seventeen or eighteen men to fight five 
hundred, unless an unavoidable necessity forced them to it ; and that 
if he thought possible for us to escape m the night, we had nothing 
else to do but to attempt it. He answered, if his lordship gave him 
such orders he would lose his life if he did not perform it ,* wo soon 
brought his lord to give that order, though privately, and we imme- 
diately prepared for putting it in practice. 

And first, as soon as it began to be dark we kindled a fire in our 
little camp, which we kept burning, and prepared so as to make it 
burn all night, that the Tartars might conclude we were still there ; 
but as soon as it was dark, and we could see the stars (for our guide 
would not stir before), having all our horses and camels ready loaded, 
we followed our new guide, who I soon founa steered himself by the 
north star. 

After we had travelled two hours very hard it began to Ije lighter 
still ; not that it was dark all ICiight, but the moon began to 'rise, so 
that, in short, it was rather lighter than we wished it to be ; but by 
six o'clock the next morning we had got above thirty miles, having 
almost spoiled our horses. Here we found a Russian village, named 
Kerma7jnsko3% where we rested, and heard nothing of the Kalmuck 
Tartars that day. About two hours before night we set out again, 
and travelled till eight the next morning, though not quite so hard. as 
before ; and about seven o'clock we passed a little river, called 
Kirtza, and came to a good large town inhabited by Russians, called 
Ozomoys ; there we heard that sevjeral troops of Kalmucks had been 
abroad upon the desert, but that we were now completely out of dswi- 
ger of them, which was to our great satisfaction. Here we were 
obliged to get some fresh horses, and having need enough of rest we

staid five days ; and my partner and I agreed to give the honest Sibe- 
rian who brought us thither the value of ten pistoles. 

In five days more we came to Veuslima upon the River Wirtzogda, 
and running into the Dwina : we were there, very happily, near tlie 
end of our travels by land, that river being navigable, in seven days' 
passage, to Archangel. From hence we came to Lawrenskoy the 
3d of July ; and, providing ourselves with two luggage boats, and a 
barge for our own convenience, we embarked the 7th, and arrived all 
safe at Archangel the 18th ; having been a year, five months, and 
three days on the journey, including our stay of eight months at 
Tobolsk!. We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the 
arrival of the ships, and must have tarried longer had not a Ham- 
burgher come in above a month sooner than any of the English 
ships r when, after some consideration that the city of Hamburgh 
might happen to be as good a market for our goods as London; we 
all took freight with him ; and, having put our goods on board, it 
was most natural for me to put my steward on board to take care of 
them ; by which means my young lord had a sufficient opportunity 
to conceal himself, never coming on shore again all the time we staid 
there ; and this he did that he might not be seen in the city, where 
some of the Moscow merchants would certainly have seen and dis- 
co vere^l him. 

We then set sail from Archangel the 20th of August the same 
year ; and, after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived safe in the 
Elbe the 18th of September. Here my partner and I found a very 
good sale for our goods, as well those of China as the sables, etc. , 
of Siberia ; and, dividing the produce, my share amounted to 
£3475 17«. 3(f., including about six himdred pounds* worth of dia- 
monds which I purchased at Bengal. 

Here the young lord took his leave of us and went up the Elbe, 3n 
order to go to the court of Vienna, where he resolved to seek protec- 
tion, and could correspond with those of his father's friends who 
were left alive. He did not part without testimonies of gratitude for 
the service I had done him, and for my kindness to the prince his 
father. ' 

To conclude : having staid near four months in Hamburgh, I came 
from thence by land to the Hague, where I embarked in the packet 
and arrived in London the 10th of January, 1705, having been absent 
from England ten years and nine months.' And here I resolved to 
prepare for a longer journey than all these, having lived a life of in- 
finite variety seventy-two years, and learned sufficiently to know the 
value of retirement and the blessing of ending our days in peace.
