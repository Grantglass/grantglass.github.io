I have found the story of Robinson Crusoe, from 'beginning to
end, very excellent for thought work in the second grade. I have
read from the complete story to the children first, as a morning
reading. Then, for their own reading lesson later in the day, have
taken the corresponding chapters in this little book.
The children are doubly interested in their own reading then,
because an interest has already been created. They are pleased to
find themselves able to read the story, too. The amount of talking
it will arouse in the class is almost endless.
In one class I encouraged the children to make everything
that Robinson Crusoe made, even to dressing up a little wooden
manikin — not in goat skin to be sure, but in bits of fur that
would answer very well for Crusoe's new clothes.
In the story a good opportunity is offered to bring out ideas of
loneliness, where there is no companionship, and the utter depend-
ence of all of us on one another.
No one need fear that the effect of the story will be to cause
boys to desire to run away from home. By reading from a
complete edition to the children, every opportunity is given to
show that this boy suffered as the result of his wrong doing, and
that it was only after long years of hard work that he came back
to his birthright, — human companionship.

THE STORY OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
Robinson Crusoe lived in a city
near the sea.
Every day great ships came into the
harbor.
They came up to the docks.
They brought wonderful cargoes.
They brought silks from China.
They brought spices from the Indies.
Robinson Crusoe.
They brought parrots from South
America.
Strange people came in these ships.
They came from all the countries in
the world.
They looked very wonderful to
Robinson Crusoe.
They wore strange clothes.
They spoke strange languages.
They told of wonderful countries,
far away.
They told of countries where it was
always summer; where there was
always fruit. ':*,
They told of countries where there
were lions and tigers. And where
there were gay feathered birds,— and
flowers such as Robinson Crusoe had
never dreamed of.
All these stories made Robinson
Crusoe want to go away in the big
ships.
They made him want to see these
wonderful countries.
They made him think his own
country had no beauty at all.
He thought of these countries all the
time by day.
He dreamed about them at night.
He could not study. He did not
want to go to school.
At last he ran away from home.
He was wrecked on a lonely island.
He lived there for many years.
After a long time he came home
again.
He was an old man when he came
home.
He wrote the story of his life on the
island.
Here is what he said about it:
THE VOYAGE.
I set sail one sunny morning.
I had run away.
No one at home knew I meant to
run away.
But this morning I met one of my
boy friends.
"Come with us, Robinson Crusoe,"
he said.
"Where?" I asked.
"We sail away for America this
morning," he said.
ii
>
I looked out on the water.
It looked so beautiful to me!
It was so broad and free.
I looked back at the city.
The city looked hot and close.
"I will go with you," I said; and I
rushed down to the wharf.
I hurried on ship board.
I could hardly wait for the ship to
start.
Then the cannon boomed.
That was the signal to start.
The vessel began to turn around.
The water splashed and foamed.
Then we moved out of the harbor.
How happy I was!
Soon we were far, far out on the
water.
I turned to look at the city we had
left.
It looked very small and dim so far
away.
Soon it faded away, and I could see
nothing but water everywhere.
The water was on every side.
The sky looked like a great bell.
I could see where it met the water
on all sides.
I could not help thinking once in
a while of my mother and father.
I knew how grieved they would be.
Sometimes I almost wished I could
go back to land again.
By and by, the ship began to rock.
A great wind came up.
The ship heaved and tossed.
I could not keep on my feet.
I was thrown against the sides of
the vessel.
I began to grow very dizzy.
I could not see. Everything seemed
to whirl round and round.
The storm grew worse and worse.
Even the old sailors were alarmed.
They thought each wave would
swallow up the ship.

But the sailors only laughed at me.
"You will get use to this by-and-
by," they said.
But I grew sicker and sicker.
The sailors carried me down in the
cabin.
They put me into a berth.
For two days I was too seasick to
move.
How I longed to go home!
Then the storm cleared away.
We had beautiful weather again.
Then I forgot how sick I had been.
I began to enjoy all again.
By-and-by, another storm came up.
I was not seasick this time.
I had become used to the rocking
now.
I liked the noise and excitement.
I liked the howling of the wind.
I liked to see the waters toss.
It was fun to see the vessel ride
over the waves.
"I am glad I am a sailor!" I cried.
THE WRECK.
But another storm came down upon
us. A third storm!
This was a hard, hard storm.
Even the old sailors looked anxious.
The captain watched carefully.
Every man was on board and ready
for orders.
Our ship tossed like a nutshell on
the waters.
The waves were as high as a house.
And how they roared!
«9

Robinson Crusoe.
The sky was black.
The rain poured.

We could see nothing.
Then a sailor cried, "Land! Land!"
Everybody rushed up from the
cabin.
"Where is it!" they cried.
But a big wave dashed over the side
of the ship just then.
It flooded the deck.
It drove the people back down into
the cabin.
A few sailors clung to the rigging.
They tried to watch. But the rain
beat in their faces, and they could see
very little.
Then we felt a fearful shock.
Bang went the vessel against a rock!
"The ship has sprung a leak! The
ship has sprung a leak!" the sailors
shouted.
Only one minute, and the cabin was
filled with water.
The whole side of the vessel was
gone.
Already it had begun to sink.
Everybody screamed for help.
Everybody tried to save his own
life.
We had our little boat fastened to
the side of the ship.
»
The men let the boat down and we
all climbed into it.
We had no oars.
But that did not matter, for we
could not have rowed in such a sea.
We held on to the sides of the boat.
If we could only float till the wind
went down! That was all we could
hope.
But that was not to be.
A great wave came rolling up.
It dashed over the boat.
The boat rocked and rolled.
It filled with water and overturned.
We were all thrown into the sea.
I tried to swim But no one could
swim in such a sea.
S'
Another wave burst over me.
Then the sea tossed me up on a
rock.
I could not see, but I clung to the
rock.
Another wave swept over me,
another, and another. Still I clung.
Then I climbed up the rock.
It seemed like a cliff.
I clung as hard as I cou but I
could not hold on.
I fell, and that was the last I knew.
ON AN ISLAND.
I do not know how long I lay there.
But, by and by, I opened my eyes.
I was on an island.
I looked around me for my
companions.
Not one was to be seen.
I knew they must have drowned.
I was all alone. I was the only one
that was saved.
"What shall I do here alone?" I
thought.
25
I was wet, and cold, and very hungry
and thirsty.
^ -

There might be wild animals on the
island too.
I had no gun. What could I do if
they attacked me.
The storm was over; but the waters
were still rough.
It was getting dark. I began to
wonder where I should sleep.
I dared not sleep on the ground.
So I climbed up into a tree.
There I slept all night long.
When the sun came up again, I
woke.
Now the sky and sea were clear
and quiet.
The waters were dancing in the
sunlight.
There was no sign of a storm.
I climbed down from the tree.
I walked about in search of food.
I was weak and faint.
At last I found a stalk of corn.
On it were three ears.
Was ever corn so welcome?
I ate one ear and put the others in
my pocket.
Near by was a clear spring of water.
I knelt down and drank.
It was the sweetest water I ever
tasted.
Not far away was a hill.
I climbed it and looked out over
the sea.
There was water on every side, as
far as I could see.
But on the water lay the wrecked
ship.
It lay over on its side. It had not
sunk after all!
It looked a mile away.
If I could only get to it!
There would be food there in the
hold.
Could I swim so far?
I must try.
So I ran down to the shore.
I found the • water shallow, so I
waded out.
I waded almost as far as the ship.
Then I swam.
When I reached the ship, I was
greeted with the barking of our dog,
Barri.
Poor fellow! he had kept himself
from drowning.
But how hungry he must be!
"If I find any food you shall have
some, Barri," I said.
Barri seemed to understand.
And how glad he was to see me!
And how glad I was to see him!
I was not quite so lonesome now.
There were two cats, too, on board.
They, too, were glad to see me.
I climbed up the ship's sides.
First of all, I hunted for food.
I found some biscuits; and Barri
and I ate all we wanted.
Then I built a raft.
I put upon it everything I could
find.
There was the box of biscuits, a flint
to strike fire with, a box of tools, a
sabre, some guns and some powder.
Then Barri and I rowed towards
the island.
It was nearly night now.
So I landed my cargo and prepared
again for sleep.

In the morning I went back again
to the ship.
I meant to bring everything to the
island I could find.

All day long I worked, rowing my
raft back and forth.
Then I built a tent frame of poles
and covered it over with the sails of
the ship.
I had a tent full of things.
I had food and bed clothes, knives,
scissors and ropes.
I had even a bag of gold; but I
had no use for the gold.
Barri and I were sure of food now
for a long time.
Perhaps I could shoot some game,
by and by.
At any rate we should not starve
quite yet.
And we would keep a watch out on
the sea.
If we could only sight a ship. We
would signal it.
If it saw our signal, it would come
and rescue us. *^

MY NEW HOME.
Of course I could not forever live
in a tent.
Besides, my tent was not built in a
good part of the island.
The land was too low and damp.
So I looked around for a better
place.
I found one on the side of the hill
near the water.
This I liked. It was warm and
sunny. It was high and dry; and I
could look out over the sea.
36
Just back of it was a sharp cliff.
This shut off the cold winds.
There was a cave in the cliff, too.
This I could use for a storehouse.
Then I brought up my tent and all
that was in it.
I set to work at once to build my
house.
I made a fence shaped like a
semi-circle.
In this way I had a beautiful yard.
Then, too, it was a protection against
any foe.
I made it very strong.
I drove two rows of stakes into the
ground.

One row was just inside the other.
There was only a little space
between them.
Then I sharpened the ends of all
the stakes.
Between these two rows of stakes I
laid in row after row of ship cable.
Then, inside the whole, I drove
slanting stakes.
These leaned against the inner row.
They braced it so; it could not fall.
I had a fence now that neither man
nor animal could break through or
climb over.
I had no gate.
Instead, I used a ladder when I went
in and out.
This was hard work. It took me
three months to make this fence.
Then I began to build my cabin.
I wanted it rainproof.
First I set up two poles on either
side of the cave opening.
These were ten feet apart.
On these I laid a cross piece of
timber.
Then I nailed rafters to this cross
piece.
The other end of the rafters leaned
on the rocky cliff.
This formed a slanting roof.
I covered the roof with leaves and
grass.
The sides of the house I made of
poles, and filled in the cracks with
mud.
I cut a piece of the sail, and
fastened it up for a door.
Now my house was built.
I began next to clean out the cave.
I carried out load after load of rocks
and laid them just inside the fence.
By and by I had a nice large space
in the cave.
The cave made a dark cool cellar
for my house.
HOW I FINISHED MY HOUSE.
A storm came up while I was at
work in the cave.
It grew so dark I could not see.
The thunder rolled nearer and
nearer.
Then the lightning began to flash.
I thought of my bags of powder
first of all.
What if the lightning should get at
that!
If that were lost I could kill no
game.
And if I killed no game what would
I do for food.
As soon as the shower was over, I
carried the powder into the cave.
I separated it and put it into bags.
These I hid away back in the cave
where it could not get wet
All this time I went out daily to
hunt for game.
One day I saw a flock of goats.
I was glad to see them, but they
were very shy.
One day I fired at one of them.
It was an old mother goat that I
shot.
It had a little kid by its side.
It grieved me to have shot the
mother.
But what could I do? I must have
food.
I picked up the goat and threw it
over my shoulders.
The little kid followed along with
me to my home.
I hoped I could tame the little kid.
But it would not eat; and I had to
to kill it, too, to keep it from starving.
Some days I was very sad and
lonesome.
I thought of my good home in
England.
I knew my father and mother were/
grieving for me.
And often I wished myself back in
my own home.
What if no ship should ever sail
this way?
What if I should live here forever?
Among the things I had brought

from the ship were ink, and pens and
paper.
There was a Bible, too, and several
other books.
I was afraid I should forget the
days of the week.
So I set up a tall post.
At the top I cut these words:
"1 came here Sept. 30, 1659."
Then every day I made a little
notch in the post.
Each seventh day I made a longer
notch.
In this way I could know the days.
One day it rained all day.
I was lonesome and discouraged.
"Still I have much to be thankful
for," I said to myself.
Then I took my pen and paper.

This is what I wrote:
"I am on a • lonely island,
hope of being rescued.
"But I am alive and well.
No
"I am all alone.
"I have food and water.
"I have no clothes.
"But it is always warm here.
"I have little ammunition.
"But there are no wild animals here
to fight.
"I have no one to speak to all day
long.
"But I have Barri and the cats, and
these things from this ship."
Then I read over what I had
written.
It seemed to me then I was not so
very badly off, after all.
I might have been very much worse
off.
"I will make some furniture for my
house now," I said.
"If I stay here, I may as well be
comfortable."
So I made a table.
Then I made some rough chairs.
I made a shelf, too, across my cabin.
I needed this for my books.
This was not easy work at all.
For I had only an axe and an adze.
I had to chop down a tree to make
each board.
Then I must hew it out with my
axe till it was as thin as I wanted it to
be.
Then with my adze I could smooth
it
This is why it took a whole tree for
a board.
Then I drove spikes into the walls
to hang my guns on.
I began to think I had quite a
home.
"If I only had a light!" I thought,
"I should not have to go to bed so
early.
So I began to save up the tallow
from the goats I killed.
I then made a little clay dish and
baked it in the sun.
I found some oakum for a wick.
When I lighted this lamp, it made
my cabin light, though it flickered
rather more than I would have liked.
AN UNEXPECTED CROP.
HOW THE WHEAT GREW.
One day some green blades began
to spring up in my yard.
They looked something like grass.
I watched them every day.
S3
I liked to see them growing; they
were fresh and green.
By and by, I noticed they had little
heads of seed.
What could they be?
The heads grew bigger and bigger.
At last I found they were wheat
heads.
How glad I was!
But where could they have come
from?
I wondered and wondered.
But at last I remembered the bags
that I had put the powder into.
They were wheat bags.
And I had shaken them out in my
yard before I put the powder in.
It seemed to me this was like food
from Heaven.
I thought of the prayer: "Give us
this day our daily bread."
I watched the wheat very carefully.
I drove stakes around it so that
Barri could not hurt it.
By and by it was ripe.
Then I gathered all the seeds.
I laid them away to plant when the
right time came.
Down in a swampy place I found
some rice growing.
I gathered these seeds, too, and laid
them away.
Some day I would have wheat to
make flour with and rice to boil
Already I had caught and tamed a
goat.
This gave us milk of plenty.
By and by we would have rice and
milk!
What a treat that would be!
THE EARTHQUAKE.
One day the earth began to roll
down over the cliff.
There was an awful rumble under
the ground.
The whole hill shook.
Two strong posts in the cabin split.
I was at work in the cave when the
strange noise began.
I ran out into the cabin.
What could it be!
Was the hill tumbling in?
57
I stood trembling with fear.
Then the cabin began to sway.
I ran out into the yard.
I seized the ladder and climbed the
fence.
I dared not stay near the cliff.
I was afraid it might fall upon me.
I ran on, out into the field.
Then the earth gave three hard
shakes.
They were hard enough to shake
down a large building.
A great rock as big as a house
rolled down from the hilltop.
It fell with a great splash into the
sea.
I was so terrified I grew sick.
I knew, now, this must be an
earthquake.
What if the earth should open and
swallow me up!
For a long time I sat on the
ground afraid to move.
I did not dare to go back to my
cave.
The cliff might yet fall upon my
cabin.
I did not know whether the
earthquake was over or not.
But soon clouds began to gather in
the sky.
They were black and angry looking.
The wind rose, too.
It roared like a thousand lions.
The sea began to toss.
The waves grew high.
It was like the storm that had
wrecked the ship.
Then the rain began to pour.
So I had to go back to my cabin,
for now I was afraid of the wind.
Three great trees were torn up by
the roots.
I could hardly stand against the wind.
I struggled towards the cabin and
climbed in.
All night long I lay and trembled
with fear.
What if another earthquake should
come!
I lay and thought what I ought to
do.
If this was an earthquake island I
must move away from the cliff.
I knew it was not safe to be so near.
An earthquake might come at any
time.
One might come in the night while
I was asleep.
The rocks might roll down and
crush me.
So the next morning I set myself
to work.
I would build a new cabin.
It should set out in the broad open
place.
But, first of all, I must sharpen my
tools.
They had grown very dull.
I had brought a grindstone from the
ship.
But how could I use it?
I could not grind and turn the
handle at the same time.
So I fixed a crank to the grind-
stone handle.
To this I tied a string.
Then I made a treadle of a flat
piece of wood.
In this way I could turn the stone
with my foot.
It was very slow work.
I had only an axe and an adze;
but it took me two days to sharpen
them.
^~_ ^
THE ISLAND.
I had never yet explored the island
I lived upon.
I had been afraid I might find wild
men or fierce animals upon it.
But one morning I thought I would
set out.
64
There was a little stream of water
on the island; so I traveled along its
banks.
I walked several miles but I found
no wild men or animals.
I seemed to be all alone on the
island.
In fact, I was often very, very lonely.
But I would rather be alone than
be among wild men.
For wild men might kill me and
eat me.
I took the dog Barri with me when
I went out to explore.
The cats stayed at home and took
care of the cabin.
One day I took a long, long walk.
I walked so far, I could not get
home that night.
I found a fine grove of trees.
There were grape vines growing on
the trees along a little river.
I found ripe melons, too.
At night-time I climbed up in a
tree and slept.
Barri slept at the foot of the tree. .
The next morning I traveled farther.
I found cocoanut trees and orange
trees, lemon and citron trees.
I filled my pockets with fruit.
It was a rich treat to me.

**^/^v tt>
Then, after marking the place, I
went home and made two bags.
I carried these to where the fruit
grew.
I filled them with fruit, and had
nice fruit to eat for many days.
By and by, I thought that I would
like to live near this grove.
But this would not do.
I must live near the shore.
There I could keep watch for
ships going by.
When I saw one I meant to signal
it.
This was my only hope of ever
leaving the island.
But I built a rough little cabin in
the grove.
This I could sleep in when I
came for fruit.
I built it of poles and brushwood.
I called it my country home.
I went to it very often.
Sometimes I would stay a day or
two.
I was much pleased with what I
had learned of the island so far.
So I planned to travel all over it.
But now the rainy season came on.
It rained all the time.
It was never very cold on the island,
for the island was quite far south.

But while it rained I had to stay in
the cabin.
Meanwhile, I kept myself busy
making willow baskets.
I had learned how to weave baskets
when I was a little boy.
I was glad now that I knew how.
About this time I counted the
notches on the post I had put up.
I found I had been on the island
just three hundred and sixty-five days.
How lonely I was sometimes!
When the rainy season was over, I
started out again.
I wanted to know all about the
island that I had lived a year upon.
So I took Barri, my gun, an axe
and some food.
First, we went to the "country
house," and rested and ate fruit.
Then we traveled on and on.

Soon we came to a high cliff.
I could see all around me.
Away out across the water, I could
see some other land.
How I wondered what that land
could be!
I wondered if it were another island,
and if there were people there.
I found that this side of my island
was warmer and more beautiful than
where I had built my cabin.
There were beautiful flowers every-
where, and the trees were full of birds.
I had never seen such beautiful
birds.
Their feathers were red and green
and orange color.
There were parrots, also, in the
trees.
After a great deal of trouble I
caught a baby parrot and carried it
home with me.
I intended to try to teach it to talk.
"I will teach it to say Robinson
Crusoe," I said.
"It will make me happy to hear
some one call my name."
On our way home again, Barri
caught a tiny kid and brought it to
me.
I tied a string about its neck and
led it as far as our " country house."
I tied it there and went on to my
cabin,
74 Robinson Crusoe.
I was glad to see the cabin once
more.

I had been away nearly a month.
I rested a few days and made a
cage for Poll Parrot.
Then I went back for the kid.
Poor little thing! it was very lonely.
It was glad to see us come again.
It jumped up in my lap like a little
dog.
Then I fed it and took it home.
Think what a family I had now!
A dog, two cats, a parrot and a kid.
MY GARDEN.
I had learned now what the climate
of my island was.
I knew that there were two rainy
seasons and two dry seasons in a year.
I planted seeds at different times to
see when they grew best.
I found I could have two plantings
and two harvests.
One day some wild goats began to
browse upon the tender blades of
my grain.
77
My dog Barri, drove them off, but
they kept coming back.
"I shall have no grain left,"
I thought.
So I built a fence around the
garden.
This took me three whole weeks.
I had to work very slowly because
I had only an axe and an adze
But when the fence was done, and
the goats kept out, then whole flocks
of big black crows came.
They would sit on the fence and
look at the grain.
Then they would fly down into the
grain and eat it.
I feared I would have no grain left.
^-~*xV3s

Then I shot at the birds.
Four of them fell, the others flew off.
I took these four dead ones and hung
them on tall poles over the grain
fields.
By and by the flock flew back
again.
When they saw the four dead
crows they were frightened.
"Caw! caw! caw!" they cried. .
Then they flapped their wings and
flew away.
For crows are very wise birds.
By and by the grain was ripe.
There was a great deal of it.
There was enough to keep me and
my family from starving for a long
ti.ne.
But how should I harvest all this
grain?
I had neither scythe nor sickle.
"I will cut it with a knife," I
thought.
"It will take a long time, and I am
afraid I shall loee much of my grain."
But when I went into the cabin, I
saw on the wall a broad-sword.
I had brought this from the ship.
Now it would be useful.
For I could cut the grain with it.
It was rather slow work, but, by and
by, the harvesting was all donp
I carried the grain home in a basket,
and rubbed the wheat between the
palms of my hands to get out the
kernels.
I had planted rice, too, and it had
grown well.
When I gathered the rice I had
food enough to last a long time.
But how should I grind the
wheat?
Again, how could I make bread of
the flour, and bake it when made?
These thoughts troubled me for a
long time.
Then again, I was puzzled about
my garden.
How could I plow and harrow the
land?
How could I even dig it up?
I had no spade.
But all these things a farmer must
do.
So I set to work to make a spade.
It was very slow work.
How pleased I was when it was
finished!
Though made only of wood, it had
to do all the work of a plough.
Then I took a big heavy tree, as
heavy as I could drag.
This I dragged over the little field
back and forth.
In this way I broke up the big
clods of earth.
Then I took the spade again, and
broke the clods into still smaller
pieces.
After that I dragged a smaller tree
back and forth till the soil was quite
smooth.
It was ready now for next season's
planting.
LEARNING TO BAKE.
When the garden work was done,
I went to work in my cabin.
First of all I had to grind the grain
into flour.
"If I had had a mortar, I could
have ground the kernels to powder."
I thought I might find a stone down
on the seashore that would do.
So I searched among the rocks for
a long time.
I wanted to find a stone in which
85
the waves had worn out a hollow
place.
I had seen such hollows in the
stones along the rivers in England.
If I had had the right tools, I
would have cut a mortar out of the
solid rock itself.
But as I could find no rock that
was hollow and round enough for a
mortar, I cut down a hard wood tree
and made a block.
This I cut into shape with my axe.
Then I burned out the middle of
the block with a red hot iron.
. This made a nice, hollow place in
the block.
Then I scraped it clean and set it
on the shelf.
I had now a good mortar.
A heavy stone would serve as a
pestle, I was sure.
And now I was ready to make
flour.
But next, the flour must be sifted.
If I only knew how to weave, I
might weave sieves of goat hair.
In one of the old ship's chests I
found some coarse cloth.
It took a long time to sift the flour
through this, but when it was done,
the flour was very fine and nice.
Then came the baking.
I could make a fire with the aid of
the flint; but I had no dishes.
Not far from the cabin there was a
clay bed.
I had seen men bake jars in big
ovens in England.
I wondered if I could not make
some clay bowls and deep dishes in
the same way.
At any rate, I could try.
So I moulded some bowls from the
damp clay.

Then I made a roaring fire just
outside the cabin, and set the bowls
into it to bake.
Some of them cracked, but some of
them baked all right.
I was so delighted with my success
that I made all sorts of dishes for my
house.
I made jars in which to keep the food.
I made plates and bowls, and even
spoons.
Then I put rice and water into one
of the big jars, and set it on the fire to
boil.
It boiled very nicely; and, at last, I
had a nice dish of boiled rice and
goat's milk for supper.
The next morning I mixed some
flour and water and made a loaf of
bread.
This I put on the hot hearth and
heaped the red hot coals up around it.
I heaped the coals up very close, so
that the jar was very hot. , .
In this way the bread baked evenly
and well.
Now I had fruits and bread and
meat to eat.
I felt like a king.
I was so rich!
BOAT MAKING.
I often looked out across the water
to the land so far away.
How often I wished that I could go
there!
"It may not be so very far," I
would say.
"If there were people there, perhaps
they would help me to get home."
If I only had a boat!
I had read that the Indians hollowed
boats out of trees.
92
If they could, why could not I?
I believed I could; at any rate, it
was worth trying.
So I cut down a fine cedar tree.
It was five feet through at the base,
and four feet at the other end.
This was a good shape for a boat.
It would cut the water well.
It would make a boat twenty-two
feet long.
It took a week or more to chop down
the tree and cut off the top.
Then it took another week to shape
the ends.
Then it took a month to dig out the
inside.
It was a fine boat when it was done.

Twenty-six men could have sat in it.
I was very proud of it.
But how could I get it into the
water?
It was large and heavy, and I had
no horse or machine to help me drag it.
I found I could not move it as it
laid; so I thought I would dig a small
trench leading towards the water.
I might be able to drag it along
through that.
But no; it would not move.
What should I do?
I would try again, and dig the
trench so deep that the water would
flow into it from the sea, and thus float
my boat.
So I began again to dig and dig.
All one day I dug; but when night
came very little had been done.
Then I looked at the distance from
where I stood to the sea.
"It would take me ten years to dig a
deep trench so long," I said.
"And I hope I may not be living
here ten years from now.
"I shall have to give up this boat,
as fine as it is.
"I was very foolish not to think of
all this before I began the work.
"I should have counted the cost."
What months of hard work I had
thrown away!
But after a time I thought I would
try again.
"I will build a small canoe next
time.
"I will build one so light that I
can drag it.
So I looked around for another tree;
but I had to go half a mile from the
shore to get a good one.
There was no tree nearer the water
which was large enough.
The first boat lay just where I had
built it.
Every time I passed it I thought
how foolish I was not to have counted
the cost before I began!
But I was wiser this time.
This tree was not nearly so large;
and as soon as I had cut it down I
dug a small creek from the shore to it.
The water flowed up the creek, and
the log floated down.
I then went to work on the log, and
shaped it like a boat, and dug out the
middle, just as I had done the first.
Then I added a mast and a sail.
And at last my little boat was
finished!
But this second boat would not do
to cross the ocean in.

Still it was better than no boat.
I could go around my own island
in it.
So one fine morning I thought I
would make a trial trip in my new
boat.
It sailed very well.
How delighted I was!
It would be easy now to travel
around the island.
I made little boxes at the ends of
the boat, to put my powder and shot
in, and made a hollow place on one
edge of the boat to hold my gun.
Besides this I rigged up an umbrella
to keep off the sun.
Then I made several little short
trips with it.
But one day I thought I would
set out on a real voyage.
So I put food and blankets into the
boat and started off.
I did not think it would take very
many days.
When I reached the other side of
the island, I saw some great rocks
stretching far out into the ocean.
Beyond this was a long, long strip
of sand.
At first I thought I would go no
further.
So I anchored my boat and climbed
up one of the high cliffs to look
around.
Then I thought I would try and sail
around the point of rocks.
There seemed to be nothing to
prevent me.
So on I started again.
But when I reached the point,
something did happen.
I found myself in a strong current.
For a minute it whirled the boat
round and round.
Then it drove me out to sea.
My paddle was of no use to me;
and there was no wind to fill the sail.
Out, out I drifted into the ocean.
I thought I was lost.

How I longed then for my snug
little cabin and my pets; and I wished
I had never left them.
I stretched out my hands to the
land.
"O happy island," I said, "I shall
never see you again."
Then I thought of my unthankful
spirit.
I thought how I had grumbled at
my lot; and now what would I not
give to be on shore there again!
At last the current changed; a little
wind began to blow, and in a few
hours I found I was being driven
around to my own side of the island
again.
How thankful I was; and how
tired!
I rowed the little boat into a cave,
and, rolling myself up in my blankets,
laid me down to rest.
All night long I slept.
When the morning came I started
out to find which way to go to find my
home.
By and by I came to my country
house.
It was nearly night, so I crept in
and went to sleep again.
In the morning I was awakened by
a call.
It sounded as if someone had called
my name.
At first I thought I must be
dreaming.
_r'<

But the call came again.
"Robin! Robin! Robin Crusoe!" it
said.
I sprang to my feet.
How frightened I was!
"Robin Crusoe, where have you
been?" said the voice.
But just then I saw a flutter of
handsome feathers through the trees.
"Oh Polly, Polly, how you frightened
me!
Then Polly come down and alighted
on my shoulder.
She laid her head up close to my
face and kept saying, "Robin, Robin!
Poor Robin Crusoe I"
I had now lived on the island six
years.
I had used up many of the things I
brought from the ship.
Many of them were worn out.
My clothes were ragged and torn.
I could hardly get into my coat, it
was so torn.
"I must have something to wear," I
cried.
"These old clothes will not even
hang together much longer."
108
Then I looked at the bag of gold.
"Strange," I thought, "I have so

much money to buy with, but cannot
buy anything."
"I will try to make myself a new
suit of clothes.
"I will make it from the goat skins
I have dried."
So again I went to work to meet
my needs.
I cut one skin into a square shape
for the back of a coat.
Another skin I cut square for the
front.
These I sewed together with a
string.
I left. a place at the top for my
head, and one on each side for my
arms.
Then I sewed in some sleeves.
This was the hardest to do; but, by
and by, the coat was all made.
I put it on and went to look at
myself in the water.
I really thought I had made a very
nice coat.
I put the fur on the outside; because
it would shed the rain and also keep
out the heat.
Then I made some long leggings,
with feet on them.
These I put on as one would put on
a pair of boots.
And now that my suit was done, I
thought I would like to have a cap
and an umbrella.
I got along very nicely with these.
I made the cap like a cone,— that
being the easiest way; and I made the
back longer than the front, so that the
rain would not run down my neck.
Then, from another skin and some
sticks, I made an umbrella.
I had great trouble, at first, making
one that could be opened and shut.
But I took a world of pains with it,
and at last succeeded.
"Now," I thought, "I am ready for
all kinds of weather."
MY HOME LIFE.
I was now king of the whole island.
My cabin was my castle.
The Parrot was the only subject
allowed to talk to his king.
But I and my little family always
sat down to dinner together.
"3
Barri was getting old; so he sat
always at my right.
The two cats sat on the left.
Poll Parrot sat on my shoulder.
I was certainly a strange looking
king when full-dressed.
My goat-skin hat was very tall and
came to a point at the top.
My coat and leggings were very
shaggy.
Around my waist I wore a goat-
skin belt.
From one side my hatchet hung;
from the other, my adze.
Over my shoulder I wore another
belt

From this two bags hung; in one of
them was my powder, in the other my
shot.
Over one shoulder I carried my
gun.
Over the other I carried my
umbrella.
When I went for a long tramp, I
carried a basket of food over my
shoulder, too.
I had now two fine corn fields and
a vineyard.
I had caught also many goats by
this time.
These I kept in pastures, nicely
fenced in.
I had to catch these goats alive and
put them in pens, as my powder and
shot were running low.
"Some day," I thought, "I would
have no powder left."
Then how would I get food for
myself?
To get the goats, I had to set some
traps made of ropes and baited with
food.
But the ropes were so old that they
would not hold.
The goats would break away.
Then I dug some pits along the
path where the goats came, and
covered them over lightly with
brushwood.
The very next morning I found that
three kids had fallen through into the
pits.
I tied the three together and led
them home.
I fed and cared for them, and at
last they grew quite tame.
Then I built some pastures for
them.
This took a very long time, for
every bit of the fence had to be cut
from trees.
While I was building this fence I
kept the kids near me.
I fed them with wheat and rice.
They even learned to eat out of my
hand.
From time to time I caught more
goats.
At the end of three years I had
forty-three goats.
I was sure now of enough meat and
milk for my whole family.
„«»'>'' • *"
A BAD SCARE.
About this time I was one day
walking along the shore, feeling very
lonely.
I longed to speak to somebody once
more.
I looked out across the water and
wondered if a ship would ever come.
I had been alone on the island so
many, many years.
But just then I saw something that
made me forget everything else.
122
Robinson Crusoe.
I dropped my umbrella and stared.
What could it be?

The print of a man's foot in the
sand!
Who could have made it?
The foot was bare.
A man must have been there only a
few hours before.
Where could he have come from?
Was he a savage?
Would he eat me if he saw me?
Was he still on the island?
I listened,— I looked all around me.
But I could hear nothing, see nothing.
I rushed up to the top of a hill and
looked.
But I saw no one.
How I now wished that I could be
sure I was all alone on the island!
I forgot how lonesome I had been.
I forgot how I had longed for
some one to talk to.
I ran back to my cabin.
It was my castle now.
I climbed over and pulled up the
ladder.
For three days I did not dare to
come out.
On the fourth day I had to come
out for food.
Then, too, my poor goats needed
milking.
So I slowly crept out and looked
around.
The island was as still as ever.
I went down to the shore and hid
my boat.

If the strange visitor should see it,
he might search the island till he
found its owner.
I had heard, when I was a boy at
home, that there were cannibals on
these islands in the ocean.
That was why I was so afraid.
By and by, I slowly got over my
fear.
I felt sure there could be no one
else on this island.
Whoever it was, he had gone
away.
Still, he might come again.
I did not feel quite safe.
So I went to work to strengthen my
cabin.
Twelve years before, I had planted
a circle of trees around the outside of
the fence.
I had planted them very close
together.
They had now grown quite large.
They were so close that I had only
to drive a few posts in between them
to make a solid fence.
I had now two fences around my
cabin.
In this outer fence I made seven
round holes.
Through these seven round holes I
put seven muskets, all loaded.
Robinson Crusoe.
I so fitted them into place that they
served as seven small cannons.

I could fire the seven in two
minutes.
Then I piled soil and rocks up
inside the fence till it was ten feet
through.
I had now a real fort.
Then I planted willows all around
outside.
I planted these very thickly.
They would grow very rapidly.
In a few years they would be so
thick no one could see through.
No one would suspect there was a
cabin hidden behind them.
Then I planned a new way to come
and go from my cabin.
Instead of climbing the fence, I
would climb the cliff.
130
Robinson Crusoe.
To do this I must have two ladders,
one leading from the outer wall up to
a shelf of rock in the cliff, the other

leading from the shelf to the top of the
cliff.
When these ladders were taken
down, no man could get down to the
cabin from the cliff overhead.
For two whole years I did not dare
to fire my gun; I dreaded to chop
wood or drive nails.
I was afraid some one might hear me.
I did not go away from my cabin
except to go to my goats.
I dreaded even to make a fire, lest
some one should see the smoke.
To avoid this, I made some
charcoal.
I made it by burning wood under
turf till it became dry coal.
This would burn without smoke.
A NEW CAVE.
One day I was very busy cutting
firewood.
I had gone into a thick wood to do
this, so that no one should see me.
As I pushed through the brush I
came upon a cave.
It was a large cave; so large that I
could stand in it.
I looked in.
It was dark as midnight.
Then I slowly crept in.
132
Soon my eyes began to grow a little
used to the darkness.
I could see a little now.
I felt my way along the walls
I was sure it was a long cave.
Just then I heard a sound.
It was something like a moan.
My heart beat fast.
How quickly I sprang back!—-for
there in the darkness I saw two great,
shining eyes.
How they glared!
They were like fire.
I ran frightened from the cave.
"What a coward!" I thought.
"God is everywhere, and able to
protect me."
So I returned towards the cave.
I seized a branch of a tree and set
it on fire.
With this held in front of me, I
pushed my way again into the cave.
I must know what those shining
balls of fire mean.
Again I heard the moan.
I was so frightened I could hardly
stand.
My knees shook and my teeth
chattered.
Still I went on into the cave.
The burning branch lighted the
way.

Ah! now I saw what the balls of
fire meant.
It was only an old, old goat, that
had crept in there to die.
I tried to take him out, but the
poor old goat could not stand.
So I left him and went away.
"To-morrow I will come with
candles and see what this cave is
like," I said.
The next day I came again.
I brought candles made of tallow.
The cave did not seem very large;
but at the end was a narrow opening.
Creeping on my hands and knees
through this low opening, I came to a
great open place.
Here was a room twenty feet high.
The floor was dry and level and
covered with gravel.
"Just the place!" I cried.
"I will bring some of my goods
here.
"I will bring my powder and guns.
"Then if anything happens, I have
a hiding place."
MORE SAVAGES.
It was not very long after this
before I had another scare, worse than
the first.
This time I saw five canoes fastened
to the shore.
138
Where had they come from?
I took my spy glass and climbed
up the cliff.
From there I could see thirty
savages.
These men had kindled a big fire,
and were dancing around it.
They were howling and yelling.
Then they dragged two men out
from one of the canoes.
One of these men they threw upon
the ground.
The other one started and ran.
He ran straight towards my house-
Three of the savages turned and
ran after him.
But he ran faster than they could.
Pie reached the creek and swam
across.
Two of the savages swam after him.
"Now," thought I, "is my chance to
save him."
So I seized my gun and ran
towards the runaway.
I motioned to him to come to me.
Then I rushed on the other two
savages and killed them.
They had never heard a gun before,
141
and even the poor runaway
terribly frightened.
He stood shaking with fear.
was

I made signs to him to come nearer.
He came a little way and then
stopped.
I could see that he was trembling;
so I smiled upon him, and again
motioned him to come nearer.

At length he came close to me.
Then he knelt down, kissed the
ground, and laid his head upon the
ground; and, taking me by the foot,
set my foot upon his head.
This, it seems, meant, "I will be
your faithful servant forever."
Then I motioned to him to bury
the two savages, so that the others
would not see them.
When this was done, I led him to
my cave.
Here I gave him bread and a
bunch of raisins to eat, and a drink of
water; for he seemed to need them
very much.
Then I made signs to him to lie
down and sleep, pointing to a place
where I had laid a great parcel of rice
straw.
So the poor man lay down and
went to sleep.
I noticed that he was very good
looking, tall, and about twenty-six
years of age.
It was Friday when all this
happened; and so I named him
Friday.
At first I was not sure Friday
would be a true friend.
He had shown me that his own
people were cannibals.
They had come over to the island
that day to have a cannibal feast.
They had meant to eat Friday, and
would have done so had he not ran
away.
So I did not know but some day
Friday would want to eat me.
The first night I made a bed for
him outside the fence.
But, by and by, I learned what a
friend Friday was; how grateful and
loving he could be.
Then I took him into the cabin and
made a bed for him there.
THE BATTLE.
In a little time I began to teach
Friday to speak English.
He was a very bright young man,
and learned very fast.
He also learned to use the axe and
adze, and to grind the tools, too.
146
He even learned how to cook and
bake; how to plant, and how to
harvest.
One day I said to Friday, "Would
you like to go home?"
"O yes, I much glad to go home."
"What would you do there?" I
asked.
"I tell people live good; eat corn,
bread, fish; drink milk; no eat man
more."
"But perhaps they would kill you,
Friday."
"No; they love me," Friday said.
"Then you may go, Friday, if you
want to."
"How go?
"No swim so far."
"I will help you to make a big
canoe."
"Friday go not, if you go not."
"I am afraid they would kill me,
Friday."
"No, no, no kill you.
"We make them love you."
Then Friday told me about seven-
teen white men-that lived on his island
with his people.
They had been wrecked on the
shore, and his people had been very
kind to them.
This made me long to go across the
sea to Friday's home.
Perhaps the white men there were
Englishmen like myself.
How glad I would be to see them!
Perhaps they could plan some way
to get back to England.
So with Friday's help I started to
make a large boat, fit to cross the sea
in.
For a whole month we worked,
shaping the boat from a large tree.
Then I fixed a mast and a sail to it.
Friday was very much surprised at
first.

He could row a boat, hut had never
seen a sail.
But I soon taught him how to
manage and sail the boat.
Now we had only to wait for good
weather to make our start
Friday had been with me now about
three years.
And I had been on the island
twenty-six years.
I was a mere boy when I came.
Now I was almost an old man.
One morning Friday came running
down the ladder into the cabin.
"Oh! Oh! Oh!" he cried.
"Why, Friday! What is it?"
"Oh! Oh! Oh!"
"Tell me, Friday, quick!"
"Canoes! one! two! three!
"Come to take Friday!
"Eat Friday!" the poor, frightened
fellow cried.
"No, no Friday! Twill not let them
eat you," I said.
"Tell me where they are. We will
go and shoot them."
"We no shoot so many."
O yes we can. You do just what I
tell you to do."
So I loaded all my pistols and guns,
and hung the great sword to my belt,
and gave Friday the hatchet.
Then I crept up the hill, my spy-
glass in my hand.
Yes, there the cannibals were again.
I could count twenty-one of them,
besides their prisoners.
They had made a fire, and were just
making ready to feast again.
"We must shoot them all, Friday,"
I said.
"Not one must escape."
There were some woods that led
down almost to where the savages
were.
I told Friday to follow me silently
through the woods, and we would
come upon them without being seen
ourselves.
By this means we were able to
creep up very close to them.
Here I called softly to Friday, and
showing him a great tree, which was
just at the corner of the wood, I told
him to go to the tree and see what
they were doing.
He did so, and told me that nine-
teen of the savages were sitting around
the fire feasting; and that one of the
prisoners was a white man.
This made me very angry.
There was not a moment to lose.
"Now, Friday," I said, "you must
do just as I do."
Friday said he would.
"Are you ready?" I whispered.
"Now, shoot!"
Both of us fired at the same time.
Three savages were killed.
Several others were wounded.
The others jumped and ran.
We fired again.
More savages fell.
Again we fired, again more fell.
Only five were left.
They ran to their canoes.
"Fire at them, Friday, while I
unfasten this poor prisoner," I shouted.
Friday fired and killed one more.
I ran and cut the cords which
bound the hands and feet of the poor
white man.
I lifted him up, and asked him by
signs, as well as I could, of what
country he was.
"A Spaniard," he replied.
I found I could not talk to him
then; so I said, "We will talk
afterwards, but we must fight now."
Meanwhile, four of the cannibals
were getting away in a canoe.
"We must follow them, Friday," I
shouted, "or they will bring their
whole tribe to fight us."
So, running to one of the canoes, I
jumped in, and told Friday to follow
me.
But as soon as I was in the canoe I
saw a poor man lying in the bottom
of it.
He was bound hand and foot, and
was almost dead with fright.
I cut the ropes that bound him, and
called to Friday to speak to the poor
man, and tell him he- was free.

But when Friday came and looked
in his face, it would have made your
tears come to see how he hugged and
kissed him.
"O, sir!
"O, Robinson Crusoe! O! O! O!"
And Friday began to dance and
scream.
"What is the matter Friday?" I
cried.
"O, Robinson Crusoe! He — my—
father!"
Then Friday screamed and danced
some more.
The four savages were all the time
getting farther away.
Still, how could I blame Friday?
He was so glad to see his father!
It was useless to start out after the
savages now.
Besides, a storm was coming up.
We would not dare go out upon the
water in a little canoe.
So we took the Spaniard and
Friday's father to the cabin and gave
them food, and made ready some beds
for them.
They both were very sick and weak,
and needed much care.
But in a few days they were well
and strong again.
Then the Spaniard told me about
his home among the savages.
There were sixteen more white men
there.

They had been wrecked on the
coast.
The savages treated them kindly.
but they wanted very much to escape.
They had no vessel, however, and
no tools with which to build one.
I asked him if he thought they
would come to this island and help
build a large vessel.
He thought, as they were so
unhappy, that they would be willing
to do anything if I would help them
to escape.
But I could not ask them to come
yet awhile; for there was not food
enough on the island to keep so many
men.
So we all set to work to plant more
wheat and barley and rice.
We also caught more goats, and
gathered and dried many bushels of
grapes.
By and by, harvest time came.
We gathered two hundred and
twenty bushels of grain, and as much
more rice.
There was food enough now.
So I told the Spaniard he might
take a canoe and go over to the main-
land, with Friday's father, and see
what he could do with the white men
he had left there.
They took with them bread and
raisins, and two guns.
I also gave them powder enough for
eight charges; but told them to be
very careful of the powder, and not to
use it if they could help it.
Then the canoe sailed away.
They promised to come back as
soon as they could.
They were to run up a flag on their
boat when they came back.
Then we could see it long before it
reached the island.
THE ENGLISH SHIP.
The little canoe had been gone only
a few days, when, one morning Friday
came running back to the cabin.
"They come! they come!" he cried.
"What! so soon as this?"
I jumped up and ran to the top of
the cliff, my spy-glass in my hand.
166
Yes, there was a boat.
But it was not the boat I was
looking for.
It was a large sail boat, and in the
distance was a ship.
And an English ship at that.
It lay about two miles off the shore.
A boat was coming from it towards
the island.
An English boat manned by
English sailors!
How my heart beat!
I was rescued at last!
When the boat reached the shore,
we ran down to meet it.
How surprised the sailors were to
find a white man on the island.
"How did it happen?" they asked.

Then I told them all about the
wreck.
I took the captain to my cabin.
I showed him my housekeeping
and my goat pastures.
"We will take you home," said the
captain.
"Me too," said Friday.
"Do you want to go with me,
Friday?" I said.
"Would you not rather go to your
own home?"
"Friday go with Robinson Crusoe,"
the poor fellow replied; and so I took
him.
I left a letter for the white men who
were to come from Friday's island,
and told them what had happened.
I told them I would have a ship
sent out to rescue them.

I left them all the corn and rice and
all my ammunition.
I took with me for relics my great
goatskin cap, my umbrella and my
parrot, not forgetting my bag of gold.
Then I said goodby to my old
home, and sailed away in the English
ship.
How strange it all seemed!
How strange England seemed!
My father had grown so very old!
He could hardly believe it was his
own son who had come back.
Everybody had grown old; for I
had lived on the island twenty-eight
years!

this book into his hands as
his very own, his fingers will tingle to draw the "big buds,
little buds, fat buds, lean buds, jolly buds, sober buds," that
crown the opening page, and which create an appetite to
