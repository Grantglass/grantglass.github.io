PREFACE.
H E Success the former Part of
this Work has met with in the
Worlds has yet been no other,
than is acknowledgdto he due to
the surprizing Variety of theSib-
je£i, and to the agreeable Man-
ner of the Performance.
ALL the Endeavours of envious People to
reproach it with being a Romance, to search it
for Errors in Geography, Inconsistency in the
Kelatien, and Contradictions in the Fail, have
proved abortive, and as impotent as malicious.
^HE just Application of every Incident, the
religious and useful Inferences drawn from every
Part, are so many Testimonies to the good De-
sign of making it publick,and must legitimate
all the Part that may b^caltd Invention, or
Parable in the Story.
T'HE Second Part, if the Editor s Opinion
way pass, is (contrary to the Usage of Second
Parts J every way as entertaining as the First.,

contains as strange and surprizing Incidents, and
as great a Variety of them j nor is the Applica-
tion less serious, or suitable; and doubtless will,
to the sober, as well as ingenious Reader, be
every Way as profitable and diverting; and this
makes the abridging this Work, as scandalous,
as it is knavish and ridiculous; seeing, while to
shorten the Book, that they .may seem to reduce
the Value, they strip it os all those Reflections,
as well religious as moral, which are not only
the greatest Beauties of the Work, but are
calculated for the infinite Advantage of the
Reader.
B T this they leave the Work naked of its
brightest Ornaments; and yet they would, at the
fame time they pretend, that the Author has sup-
ply d the Story out of his Invention, take from it
the Improvement, which alone recommends that
Invention to wife and good Men.
T"HB Injury these Men do to the Proprie-
tor of this Work, is a PraiJice all honest
Men abhor; and be believes he may challenge
them to shew the Difference between that and
Robbing on the Highway, or breaking open a
House.
J F they can't shew any "Difference in the
Crime, they will find it hard to shew why there
fh-uld be any Difference in the Punishment:
Ar.d he will answer for it, that nothing shall he
iwanting on his PartjBc do them Justice.

. . HAT homely Proverb used on so mssly
MjPjrj&Æ Occasions in England, viz. That what is
1 bred in the Bone will net go out of the Tsltsh,
was never more verify'd, than in the Story
of my Life. Any one would think,
that after thirty-five Years Affliction, aiut
a Variety ofunhappy Circumstances, vvhiili
few Men, if any ever, went thro' before, and after ne^r
seven Years of Peace and Enjoyment in the Fulness of ail
Things; grown old, and when, if ever, it might be al-
lowed me to have had Experience of every State of m iddle
Life, and to know which was most adapted to make a
Man completely happy: I say, after all this, any one would
have thought.that the native Propensity to Rambling, which
I gave an Account of in my first Setting out into tiic
World, to have been so predominate in my Thoughts,
should be worn out, the Volatile Part be fully evacuated*
or at least condens'd, and I might at 61 Years of Age have
been a little inclin'd to stay atjjome, and have done ven-
turing Life and Fortune any more.
^ Nay sarther, the common Motive of foreign Adven-
tures was taken away in me; for I had no Fortune t.o
make, I had nothing to seek: If I had gain'd ten thousand
A 3
Pounds,
[ 6 ]
Founds, I had been no richer; for I had already sufficient
for me, and for those I had to leave it to; and that I had,
was visibly increasing; for having no great Family, I could
not spend the Income of what I had, unless I would set up
for an expensive Way of Living, such as a great Family,
Servants, Equipage, Gaiety, and the like, which were Things
I had nu Notion of, or Inclination to; so that I had no-
thing indeed to do, but to sit still, and fully enjoy what I
had got, and fee it increase daily upon my Hands.
Y et all these Things had no Effect upon me, or at least
not enough to resist the strong Inclination I had to go
abroad again, which hung about me like a chronical Dis-
temper; particularly the Desire of seeing my new Planta-
tion in the Istand, and the Colony I left there, run in my
Head continually. I dream'd of it all Night, and my Ima-
gination run upon it all Day; it was uppermost in all my
Thoughts, and my Fancy work'd so steadily and strongly
upon it, that I talk'd of it in my Sleep; in shortvjiothing
could remove it out of my Mind; it even broke so violently
into all my Discourses, that it made my Converfation
tiresome; for I could talk of nothing else, all my
Discourse run into it, even to Impertinence, and I.faw it
myself. "-
I have often heard' Persons of good Judgment fay,
That all the Stir People make in the World about Ghosts
and Apparitions, is owing to the Strength of Imagination,
and the powerful Operation of Fancy in their Minds; that
there is no such Thing as a Spirit appearing, or a Ghost
walking, and the like: That People's poring affectionately
upon the past Converfation of their deceas'd Friends, so
realizes it to them, that they are capable of fansying upon
some extraordinary Circumstances, that they fee them,
talk to them, and are answer'd by them; when, in Truth,
there is nothing but Shadow and Vapour in the Thing,
and they really know nothing of the Matter.
For my Part, I know not to this Hour, whether there
are any such Things as real Apparitions, Spectres, or walk-
ing of People after they are dead, or whether there is any
Thing in the Stories theytell us of that Kind, more than
the Product of Vapours.^rk Minds, and wandring Fan-
cies; But this I know, that my Imagination work'd up
to such a Height, and brought me into such Excess of
Vapours, or what else I may call it, that I actually sup-
pos'd myself, oftentimes upon the Spot, at my old Castle
behind
trl
fcehind the Trees"; saw my old Spaniard, Tridafs Father,
and the reprobate Sailors whom I left upon the Island; nay,
I sansy'd I talk'd with them, and looked at them so steadi-
ly, tho' I was broad awake, as at Persons just before me;
and this I did, till I often frighted myself wirh the Images
my Fancy represented to me. One Time in my Sleep I
had the Villany of the three Pirate Sailors so lively related
to me, by the first Spaniard and Friday's Father, that it was
surprizing; they told me how they barbarously attempted
to murder all the Spaniards, and that they set Fire to the Pro-
visions they had laid up, on purpose to distress and starve
them; Things that I had never heard of, and that yet Were'
all of them true in sact: And it was so warm in my Imagi-"
nation, and so realized to me, that to the Hour 1 saw them,
I could not be persuaded, but that it was, or would be
true; also how I resented it, when the Spaniards com-
plain'd to me, and how I brought them to Justice, try'd.
them before me, and order'd them all three to be hang'd:
What there was really in this, shall be seen in its Place:
For however I came to form such Things in my Dream,
and what secret Converse of Spirits injected it, yet there
was, /say, very much of it true. I own, that this Dream
had nothing in it literally and specifically true; but the ge-
neral Part was so true, the base and villainous Behaviour/
ef these three harden'd Rogues was such, and had been so
much worse than all I can describe, that the Dream had
too much Similitude of the Fact; and as I would after-
wards have punished them severely, so, if I had hang'd
them all, I had been much in the Right, and should have
been justified both by the Laws of God and Man.
y: But to return to my Story; in this Kind of Temper
I had liv'd some Years, I had no Enjoyment of my Life,
no pleasant Hours, no agreeable Diversion, but what had
something or other of this in it; so that my Wife,
who saw my Mind so wholly bent upon it, told me very
seriously one Night, That she believ'd there was some se-
cret powerful Impulse of Providence upon me, which had-
determin'd me to go thither again; and that she found no-
thing hindered my going, but gay being engag'd to a Wife
and Children. She told me, that it was true, she could
not think of parting with me; but as she was assur'd, that
if she was dead, it would be the first Thing I would do i
so, as it seem'd to her, that the Thing was determin'd
above, she would not be the only Obstruction: For if I
A 4 thought
[-8 3
thought fit, and resolv'd to go —Here she found me
very intent upon her Words, and that I look'd very ear-
nestly at her; so that it a little disorder'd her, and she
stopp'd. I ask'd her, Why she did not go on, and say
out what she was going to say? But I pereeiv'd her Heart
was too full, and some Tears stood in her Eyes; Speak out,
my Dear, said I, are you willing I should go! No, says
she, very afectionately, I am sar from willing: But if you
are resolv'd to go, says she, and rather than I will be the
only Hindrance, I will go with you; for tho' I think it
a most preposterous Thing for one of your Years, and in
your Condition, yet if it must be, said she again weeping,
I won't leave you; for if it be of Heaven, you must do it,
there is no resisting it; and if Heaven makes it your Duty
to go, he will also make it mine to go with you, or other-
wile dispose of me, that I may not obstruct it.
This affectionate Behaviour of my Wife's brought me
a little out of the Vapours, and I began to consider what
I was a doing; I corrected my wandering Fancy, and be-
gan to argue with myself sedately, what Business I had,
after threescore Years, and after siich a Life of tedious Suf-
ferings and Disasters, and closed in so happy and easy a
Manner, I say, what Business had. I to rush into new Ha-
zards, and put myself upon Adventures, fit only for Youth
and Poverty to run into?
With those Thoughts, I consider'd my new Engage-
ment, that I had a Wife, one Child born, and my Wife
then great with Child of another; that I had all the World
could give me, and had no need to seek Hazards for Gain;
that I was declining in Years, and ought to think rather
of leaving what I had gain'd, than of seeking to increase
it; thac as to what my Wife had said, of its being an Im-
pulse from Heaven, and that it should be my Duty to go,
I had no Notion of that; so after many of these Cogita-
tions, I struggled with the Power of my Imagination, rea-
son'd myself out of it, as I believe People may always do in
like Case, if they will; and, in a Word, I conquer'd its
compos'd myself with such Arguments as occu.r'd to my
Thoughts, and which my present Condition furnilh'd me
plentifully with; and particularly, as the most effectual Me-
thod, I resolv'd to divert myself with other Things, and
to engage in some Business that might effectually tie me
up from any more Excursions of this Kind; for I found
the Thing retura'd upon me chiefly when I was idle, had
nothing
nothing to do, or any thing of Moment immediately be-
fore me.
y To this Purpose I bought a little Farm in the County
of Bedford, and resolv'd to remove myself thither. I had
a little convenient House upon it, and the Land about i. I
found was capable of great Improvement, and that it wis
many Ways suited to my Inclination, which delighted in
Cultivating, Managing, Planting, and Improving of Land;
and particularly, being an Inland Country, I w^s remov'd
from conversing among Ships, Sailors, and Things relating
to the remote Parts of the World.
In a Word, I went down to my Farm, settled my Fa-
mily, bought me Ploughs, Harrows, a Cart, Waggon, Hor-
ses, Cows, Sheep; and setting seriously to Work, became in
one half Year, a mere Country Gentleman; my Theughrj
were intirely taken up in managing my Servants, Cultivate-
ing the Ground, Inclosing, Planting, &c. and I liv'd, as I
thought, the most: agreeable Life that Nature was capable
of directing, or that a Man always bred to Misfortunes
was capable of being retreated to.
I sarm'd upon my own Land, I had no Rent to pay, was
limited by no Articles; I could pull up or cut down as I
pleased: What I planted, was for myself, and what I im-
proved, was for my Family; and having thus left off the
r) houghts of Wandering, I had not the least Discomfort in
in any Part of my Life, as to this World. Now I thought
indeed, that I enjoy'd that middle State of Life, which
my Father so earnestly recommended to me: A Kind ol
Heavenly Life, something like what is described by the
Poet upon the Subject of a Country .Life.
Free frora Vices. free front Care,
Agt has no Pain, and Xouth no Snare.
But in the Middle of all this Felicity, one Blow from
unseen Providence unhing'd me at once; and not only
made a Breach upon me inevitable, and incurable; but drove
me, by its Consequence, upon a deep Relapse into the
wandering Disposition, which, as I may say, being born
in my very Blood, soon recover'd its Hold of roe, and, like
the Returns of a violent Distemper, came on with an irre-
sistible Force upon me; so that nothing could make any
more Impression upon me. This Blow was the Loss of
roy Wife.
It is not my Business here to write an Elegy upon my
Wife, to give a Character of her particular Virtues, and
make my Court to the Sex by the Flattery of a Funeral
Sermon. She was, in a few Words, the Stay of all my Af-
fairs, the Centre of all my Enterprizes; the Engine, that
by her Prudence redue'd me to that happy Compass I was
jn, from the most extravagant and ruinous Project that flut-
ters in my Head, as above; and did more to guide my
rambling Genius, than a Mother's Tears, a Father's Instru-
ctions, a Friend's Counsel, or all my own reasoning Pow-
ers could do. I was happy in listening to her Tears, and
in being mov'd by her Entreaties, and to the last Degree
desolate and dislocated in the World by the Loss of her.
When she was gone, the World look'd aukwardly
round me; I was as much a Stranger in it, in my Thoughts,
as I was in the Brasils, when I went first on Shore there;
and as much alone, except as to the Assistance of Servants,
as I was in my Island. I knew neither what to do, or
what not to do. I saw the World busy round me, one
Part labouring for Bread, and the other squandering it in
vile Excesses or empty Pleasures; equally miserable, be-
cause the End they propos'd still fled from them; for the
Men of Pleasure every Day surfeited of their Vice, and
heaped up Work for Sorrow and Repentance; and the Men
of Labour spent their Strength in daily Strugglings for
Bread to maintain the vital Strength they labour'd with;
so living in a daily Circulation ot Sorrow, living but to
work, and working but to live, as if daily Bread were the
only End of wearisome Life, and a wearisome Life the only
Occasion of daily Bread.
This put me in Mind of the Life I lived in my King-
dom, the Island; where I suffer'd no more Corn to grow,
because I did not want it; and bred no more Goats, be-
cause I had no more Use for them: Where the Money lay
in the Drawer till it grew milldcw'd, and had scarce the
Favour to be look'd upon in twenty Years.
All these Things, had I improv'd them as I ought to
have done, and as Reason and Religion had dictated to me,
would have taught me to search sarther than human En-
joyments for a full Felicity, and that there was something
which certainly was the Reason and End of Life, superior
to all these Things, and which was either to be possess'd,
or at least hop'd for on this Side the Grave.
But
t « 3
But my sage Counsellor was gone; I was like a Ship
without a Pilot, that could only run afore the Wind: My
Thoughts run all away again into the old Afsair; my Head
was quite turn'd with the Whimsies of foreign Adven'ures,
and all the pleasing innocent Amusements of my Farm, and
my Garden, my Cattle and my Family, which before in-
tirely possess. me, were nothing to me; had no Relish, and
were like Musick to one that has no Ear, or Food to one
that has no Taste: In a Word, I resolv'd to leave off House-
keeping, left my Farm, and return to London; and in a
few Months after I did so.
/ When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I was
before; 1 had no Relish to the Place, no Employment in
it, nothing to do but to saunter about like an idle Person,
of whom it may be said, he is perfectly useless in God's
Creation, and it is not one Farthing Matter to the rest of
his Kind, whether he be dead or alive. This also was the
Thing, which of all Circumstances of Life was the most
my Aversion, who had been all my Days used to an active
Life; and I would often say to my self, A State of Idleness
is the -very Dregs of Lift; and indeed I thonght I was much
more suitably employ'd, when I was 16 Days a making me
a Deal Board.
It was now the Beginning of the Year 1695, when
my Nephew, whom, as I have observed before, I had brought
up to the Sea, and had made him Commander of a Ship,
was come Home from a short Voyage to Bilboa, being the
first he had made: He came to me, and told me, that some
. Merchants of his Acquaintance had been proposing to him
to go a Voyage for them to the East-Indies, and to China,
as private Traders: And now, Uncle, says he, if you will go
to Sea with me, I'll engage to land you upon your old Habi-
tation in the Island, for we are to touch at the Brasils.
Nothing can be a greater Demonstration of a future
State, and of the Existence of an invisible World, than ths
Concurrence of second Causes with the Idea's of Things,
which we form in our Minds, perfectly reserv'd, and not
communicated to any in the World.
/ M y Nephew knew nothing how sar my Distemper of
wandering was return'd upon me, and I knew nothing of
what he had in his Thoughts to say; when that very
Morning before he came to me, I had, in a great deal of
Confusion of Thought, and revolving every Part of my
Circumstances in my Mind, come to this Resolution, viz.
A 6 That
[ » 3
That I would go to Lisbon, and consult with my old Sea-
Captain; and so if it was rational and practicable, I would
go and fee the Island again, and fee what was become of
my People there: I had pleas'd my self also with the
Thoughts of peopling the Place, and carrying Inhabitants
from hence, getting a Patent for the Possession, and I know
not what; when in the Middle of all this, in comes my
Nephew, as I have said, with his Project of carrying me
thicher, in his Way to the East-Indies.
I paus'd a while at his Words, and looking steadily at
him, What Devil, said I, sent you of this unlucky Errand?
My Nephew startled as if he had been frighted at first;
but perceiving I was not much displeased with the Pro-
posal, he reoover'd himself: I hope it may not be an
unlucky Proposal, Sir, says he, I dare say you would be
pleas'd to fee your new Colony there, where you once
reigned with more Felicity, than most of your Brother
Monarchs in the World.
In a Word. the Scheme hit so exactly with my Tem-
per, that is to say, with the Prepossession I was under, and
of which I have said so much, that I told him in few
Words, if he agreed with the Merchants, I would go with
him: But I told him, I would not promise to go any sar-
ther than my own Island. Why Sir, says he, you don't want
tt be left there again, I hope * Why, said I, can you not take
me up again in your Return? He told me, it could not be
possible to do so, that the Merchants would never allow
him to come that Way with a loaden Ship of such Value,
it being a Month's sail out of his Way, and might be three
or four: Besides, Sir, if X should miscarry, said he, and not
return at all, then you would be just redue'd to the Condition
you were in before. '-
This was very rational; but we both found out a
Remedy for it, which was to carry a framed Sloop on board
the Ship, which being taken in Pieces, and shipp'd on board
the Ship, might, by the Help of some Carpenters whom we
agreed to carry with us, be set up again in the Island, and
finish'd, fit to go to Sea in a few Days.
I was not long resolving; for indeed the Importunities
of my Nephew join'd in so effectually with my Inclination,
that nothing could oppose me: On the other Hand, my
Wife being dead, I had no-body that concern'd themselves
so much for me, as to persuade me one Way or other,
except roy antient goodFriead the Widow, who earnestly
struggled

[ 13 1
struggled with me to consider my Years, my easy Circum-
stances, and the needless Hazard of a long Voyage; and
above all, my young Children: But it was all to no Pur-
pose, I had an irresistible Desire to the Voyage; and I told
her, I thought there was something so uncommon in
the Impressions I had upon my Mind for the Voyage, that
it would be a Kind of resisting Providence, if I should
attempt to stay at Home ; after which she ceas'd her Expo-
stulations, and join'd with. me, not only in making Pro-
vision for my Voyage, but also in settling my Family-
Affairs for my Absence, and providing for the Education
of my Children.
In order to this, I made my Will, and settled the Estate
I had in such a Manner for my Children, and placed it in
such Hands, that I was perfectly easy and fatisfy'd they
would have Justice done them, whatever might befal me;
and for their Education, I left it wholly to my Widow,
with a sufficient Maintenance.to herself for her Care: All
which she richly deserv'd; for no Mother could have taken
more Care in their Education, or understood it better;
and as she liv'd till I came Home, I also liv'd to thank her
for it.
M y Nephew was ready to fail about the Beginning of
January, 1694-5-, and ' with my Man FrMaywent on board
in the Downs .the 8th, having, besides that Sloop which I
mention'd above, a very considerable Cargo of all Kinds of
necessary Things for my Colony, which if I did not find
in good Condition, I icsoiv'd to leave so.
First, I carried with me some Servants, whom I pur-
posed to place there, as Inhabitants, or at least to set on
Work there upon m^ own Account while I stay'd, and either
to leave them there, or carry them forward as they should
appear willing; particularly, I carry'd two Carpenters, a
Smith, and a very handy ingenious Fellow, who was a
Cooper by Trade, but was aiib a general Mechanick; for
he was dextrous at making Wheels, and Hand-Mills to
grind Corn, was a good Turner, and a good Pot-maker;
he also made any Thing that was proper to make of Earth,
or of Wood; in a Word, we call'd him Our Jack of all
Trades.
With these I carry'd a Taylor, who had offer'd himself
to go Passenger to the East-Indies, wkh my Nephew, but
afterwards consented to stay on our New Plantation, and
prov'd a most necessary handy Fellow, as could be dtflr'd,
...'
C Hi
in many other Businesses, besides that of his Trade; for, as I
observ'd formerly, Necessity arms us for all Employment?.
M y Cargo, as near as I can collect, for I have not kept
an Account of Particulars, consisted of a sufficient Quantity
of Linen, and some thin English Stuffs for cloathing the
Spaniards that I expected to find there; and enough of them,
as by my Calculation might comfortably supply them for
seven Years; if I remember right, the Materials which I
carry'd for cloathing them, with Gloves, Hats, Shoes,
Stockings, and all such Things as they could want for
wearing, amounted to above 200 Pounds, including some
Beds, Bedding, and Houthold-Stuff, particularly Kitchen-
Utensils, with Pots, Kettles, Pewter, Brass, &c. besides
near 100 Pounds more in Iron-Work, Nails, Tools of every
Kind, Staples, Hooks, Hinges, and every necessary Thing
I could think of.
I carry'd also an hundred spare Arms, Muskets and
Fuzils, besides some Pistols, a considerable Quantity of
Shot of all Sizes, three or four Tons of Lead, and two
Pieces of Brass Cannon; and because I knew not what
Time, and what Extremities I was providing tor, I carry'd
an hundred Barrels of Powder, besides Swords, and Cutlasses,
and the Iron Part of some Pikes, and Halberts, so that in
(horr, we had a large Magazine of all Sorts of Stores; and
I made my Nephew carry two small Quarter-Deck Guns
more than he wanted for his Ship, to leave behind, if
there was Occasion;that when we came there,we might
build a Fort, and Man it against all Sorts of Enemies:
And indeed, I at first thought there would be Need enough
for it all, and much more, it we hop'd to maintain our
Possession of the Island, as shall be seen in the Course of
the Story.
I h a D|not such bad Luck in this Voyage, as I had been
used to meet with; and therefore shall have the less Occa-
sion to interrupt the Reader, who perhaps may be impatient
to hear how Matters went with my Colony; yet some odd
Accidents, cross Winds, and bad Weather happen'd, on this
first setting out, which made the Voyage longer than I
expected it at first; and I who had never made but one
Voyage, (viz.) my first Voyage to Guiney, in which I might
be faid to come back again, as theVoyage was at first design'd,
began to think the fame ill Fate still attended me; and that
I was born to be never contented with my own Shore,
and yet to be always unfortunate at Sea,
115]
Contrary Winds first put us to the Northward, and we
were oblig'd to put in at Gnl-aay in Ireland, where we lay
Wind-bound two and twenty Days; but we had this Sa-
tissaction with the Disaster, that Provisions were here
exceeding cheap, and in the utmost Plenty; so that while
we lay here, we never touch'd the Ship's Stores, but rather
added to them; here also I took several live Hogs, and two
Cows with their Calves, which I resolv'd, if I had a good
Passage, to put ashore in my Island, but we found Occasion
to dispose otherwise of them.
W £ set out the ph of February from Ireland, and had
a very sair Gale of Wind for some Days; as I remember,
it might be about the zoth of February in the Evening
late, when the Mate having 'the Watch, came into the
Round-house, and told us, he saw a Flash of Fire, and heard
a Gun fir'd; and while he was telling us of it, a Boy came
in-, and told us the Boatswain heard another. This made
us all run out upon the Quarter-Deck, where for a while
we heard nothing, but in a few Minutes we saw a very
great Light, and found that there was some very terrible
Fire ata Distance; immediately we had Recourse to our
Reckonings, in which we all agreed, that there could be
no Land that Way, in which the Fire shew'd itself, no
not for 5-00 Leagues, for it appear'd at W. N. W, Upon
this we concluded it must be some Ship on Fire at Sea;
and as by our hearing the Noise of Guns just before, we
concluded it could not be sar off, we stood directly towards
it, and were presently satisfy'd we should discover it, be-
cause the sarther we sail'd, the greater the Light appear'd,
though the Weather being hazy, we could not perceive
any Thing but the L'ght for a while: In about half an
Hour's Sailing, the Wind being sair for us, tho' not much
of it, and the Weather clearing up a little, we could plainly
discern that it was a great Ship on fire in the Middle of the
Sea. I was most sensibly touch'd with this Disaster, tho'not
at all acquainted with the Persons engaged in it; I presently
recollected my former Circumstances, in what Condition
I was in, when taken up by the Portugal Captain; and
how much more deplorable the Circumstances of the poor
Creatures belonging to this Ship must be, if they had no
other Ship in Company with them: Upon this, T im-
mediately order'd, that five Guns should be fir'd, one soon
after another, that, if possible, we might give Notice to
them, that there was Help for them at hand, and that
[ If]
they might endeavour to fave themselves m their Boat;
for though we could seethe Flame of the Ship, yet they,
it being Night, could see nothing of ut.
W e lay by some Time upon this, only driving as the
burning Ship drove, waiting for Day-light; when on a
sudden, to our great Terror, though we had Reason
to expect it, the Ship blew up in the Air; and immediate-
ly, that is to fay, in a few Minutes, all the Fire was our,
that is to fay, the rest of the Ship sonk: This was a terri-
ble, and indeed an afflicting Sight, for the Sake of the poor
Men, who, I concluded, must be either all destroy'd in
the Ship, or be in the utmost Distress in their Boats in
the Middle of the Ocean, which, at present, by reason it
was dark, I could not fee: However, to direct them as
well as I could, I caus'd Lights to be hung out in all the
Parts of the Ship where we could, and which we had
Lanthorns for, and kept firing Guns all the Night long,
letting them know by this, that there was a Ship not
far off.
About 8 a-C!ock in the Morning we diseover'd the
Ship's Boats, by the Help of our Perspective-Glassss, found
there were two of them, both throng'd with People, and
deep in the Water: We perceiv'd they row'd, the Wind
being against them; that they faw our Ship, and did the
utmost to make us see them.
We immediately spread our Ancient, to let them know
we faw them, and hung a Waft out, as a Signal for them
to come on Board, and then made more Sail, standing
directly to them. In little more than half an Hour we
came up with them, and, in a Word, took them all in,
being no less than sixty-four Men, Women, and Children;
for there were a great many Passengers.
Upon the whole, we found it was a French Merchant-
Ship of 300 Tons, homeward-bound from Jj>)uebeck, in the
River of Canada. The Master gave us a long Account
of the Distress of his Ship, how the Fire began in the
Steerage, by the Negligence of the Steersman; but, on
his crymg out for Help, was, as every Body thought, in-
tire.y put out: But they soon found, that some Sparks of
the first Fire had gotten into some Part of the Ship, so
difficult to come at, that they could not effectually
quench it; and afterwards getting in between the Tim-
bers, and within the Ceiling of the Ship, it proceeded
into
into the Hold, and master'd all .the Skill, and all the Appft
cation they were able to exert.
They had no more to do then, but to get into their
Boats, which, to their great Comfort, were pretty large,
being their Long-boat, and a great Shalloup, besides a
small Skiff, which was of no great Service to them other
than to get some fresh Water and Provisions into her,
after they had secur'd their Lives from the Fire. They
had indeed small Hope of their Lives by getting into these
Boats at that Distance from any Land,"only, as they faid
well, that they were escap'd from the Fire, and had a
Possibility that some Ship might happen to be at Sea,
and might take them in. They had Sails, Oars, and a
Compass, and were preparing to make the best of their
Way back to Newfound-land, the Wind blowing pretty
fair; for it blew an easy Gale at S. E. by E. They had as
much Provisions and Water, as, with sparing it so as to be
next door to starving, might support them about 12 Days;
in which, if they had no bad Weather, and no contrary
Winds, the Captain faid, hehop'd he might get the Banks
of Newfound-land, and might perhaps take some Fish to
sustain them till they might go on Shore. But there were
ib many Chances against them in all these Cases; such as
Storms to overset and founder them; Rains and Cold to
benumb and perish their Limbs; contrary Winds to keep
them out and starve them; that it must have been next
to miraculous, if they had escap'd.
I n the midst of their Consultations, every one being
hopeless, and ready to despair, the Captain with Tears in
his Eyes told me, they were on a sudden surpriz'd with the
Joy of hearing a Gun fire, and after that four more; these
were the five Guns, which I caused to be fired at first see-
ing the Light: This revived their Hearts, and gave them
the Notice, which, as above, I desir'd it should,
that there was a Ship at hand for their Help.
I t was upon the hearing these Guns, that they took
down their Masts and Sails; and the Sound coming from
the Windward, they resolv'd to lie by till Morning. Some
Time after this, hearing no more Guns, they fir'd three
Muskets, one a considerable while after another; but these,
the Wind being contrary, we never heard.
Some Time after that again, they were still more **"
greeably surpriz'd with seeing our Lights, and hearing the
Cunt, which as I have faid, 1 caus'd to be fk'd ail the
reft.
rest of the Night; this set them to work with their Oars
to keep their Boats a-head, at least, that we might the
sooner come up with them; and at last, to their inexpres-
sible Joy, they found we saw them.
I t is impossible for me to express the several Gesture*,
the strange Ecstasies, the Variety of Postures which these
poor deliver'd People run into, to express the Joy of their
Souls at so unexpected a Deliverance; Grief and Fear are
easily describ'd; Sighs, Tears, Groans, and a very few Mo-
tions of Head and Hands make up the Sum of its Variety:
But an Excess of Joy, a Surprise of Joy has a thousand
Extravagancies in it; there were some in Tears; some
raging and tearing themselves, as if they had been in the
greatest Agonies of Sorrow; some stark-raving and down-
right lunatick; some ran about the Ship stamping with
their Feet, others wringing their Hands; some weredance-
ing, some singing, some laughing, more crying; many
quite dumb, not able to speak a Word; others sick and
vomiting, several swooning, and ready to saint; and a/e»
were crossing themselves, and giving God Thanks.
I would not wrong them neither; there might be
many that were thankful afterward, but the Passion wai
too strong for them at first, and they were not able to
master it; they were thrown into Ecstasies and a Kind of
Frenay, and so there were but a very few who were com'
pos'd and serious in their Joy.
Perhaps also the Case may have some Addition to
it, from the particular Circumstance of the Nation they
belong'dto; I mean the French} whose Temper is al-
low'd to be more volatile, more passionate, and more spright-
ly, and their Spirits more fluid than in other Nations. I
am not Philosopher enough to determine the Cause, but
nothing I had ever seen before came up to it : The Ecsta-
sies poor Friday, my trusty Savage, was in, when he found
his Father in the Boat, came the nearest to it, and the
Surprize of the Master and his two Companions, whom I
delivered from the Villains that set them on Shore in the
Island, came a little way towards it, but nothing was to
compare to this, either that I law in Friday, or any where
. else in my. Life.
r It is sarther observable, that these Extravagancies did
not shew themselves in that different Manner I have men-
tioned, in different Persons only: But all the Variety
would appear in a short Succession of Moments, in one
and
s 19 ]
and the fame Person. A Man that we saw this Minute
dumb, and as it were stupid and confounded, should the
next Minute be dancing and hallooing like an Antick; and
the next Moment be tearing his Hair, or pulling his Cloaths
to Pieces, and stamping them under his Feet, like a Mad-
man i a few Moments after that, we should have him all
in Tears, then sick, then swooning; and had not imme-
diate Help been had, would, in a few Moments more,
have been dead; and thus it was not with one or two,
or ten or twenty, but with the greatest Part of them;
and, if I remember right, our Surgeon was obliged to let
above thirty of them Blood.
There were two Priests among them, one an old Man,''
and the other a young Man ; and that which was strangest
was, that the oldest Man.was the worst.
A s soon as he set his Foot on board our Ship, and saw>
himself fafe, he dropp'd down stone-dead, to all Appear'
ance, not the least Sign of Life could be perceiv'd in him i
our Surgeon immediately apply'd proper Remedies to re-
cover him, and was the only Man in the Ship that be-
liev'd he was not dead; and at length he open'd a Vein, in
his Arm, having first chaPd and rubb'd the Part so as to
warm it as much as possible: Upon this the Blood, which
only dropp'd at first, flow'd something freely; in three. Mi-
nutes after, the Man open'd his Eyes, and about a Quar-
ter of an Hour after that he spoke, grew better, and in a
little Time quite well; after the Blood was stopp'd, he
walk'd about, told us he was perfectly well, took a Dram
of Cordial which the Surgeon gave him, and was what we
call'd, come to himself; about a Quarter of an Hour after
this, they came running into the Cabin to the Surgeon,
who was bleeding a French Woman that had fainted; and
told him, the Priest was gone stark-mad; it seems he bad
begun to revolve the Change of his Circumstances in his
Mind, and this put him into an Ecstasy of Joy, his Spirit*
whirl'd about faster than the Vessels could convey them,
the Biood grew hot and feverish, and the Man wai as fit for
Bedlam, as any Creature that ever was in it: The Surgeon:
would not bleed him again in that Condition, but gave
him something to dose and put him to sleep, which, after
some Time, operated upon him, and he wak'd next Morn-
ing perfectly compos'd, and well.
The younger Priest behav'd himself with great Com-
mand of his Passion, and was really an Example of a seri-
ous
ous well-govern'd Mind; at his first Coming on board the
Ship, he threw himself- flat on his Face, prostrating himself
in Thankfulness for his Deliverance; in which I unhap-
pily and unreasonably disturb'd him, really thinking he had
been in a Swoon; but he spake calmly, thank'd me; told
me, he was giving God Thanks for his Deliverance; begg'd
me to leave him a few Moments, and that, next to his
Maker, he would give me Thanks also.
I was heartily sorry, that I disturb'd him, and not on-
ly left him, but kept others from interrupting him also;
he continu'd in that Posture about three Minutes, or a little
more, after I left him; then came to me, as he had said
he would; and with a great deal of Seriousness and Affecti-
on, but with Tears in his Eyes, thank'd me that had, un-
der God, given him, and so many miserable Creatures,
their Lives: I told him, I had no Room to move him to
thank God for it, rather than me; for I had seen that he
had done that already: But I added, That it was nothing
but what Reason and Humanity dictated to all Men, and
that we had as much Reason as he to give Thanks to God,
who had bless'd us so sar as to make us the Instruments of
his Mercy to so many of his Creatures.
After this, the young Priest apply'd himself to his
Country-Folks, labour'd to compose them, persuaded, in-
treated, argu'd, reason'd with them, and did his utmost
to keep them within the Exercise of their Reason; and
with some he had Succefi, tho' others were, for a Time,
out of all Government of themselves.
I cannot help committing this to Writing, as per-
haps it may be useful to those into whose Hands it may
fall, in the guiding themselves in all the Extravagancies of
their Passions; for if an Excess of Joy can carry Men out
to such a Length beyond the Reach of their Reason, what
will not the Extravagancies of Anger, Rage, and a pro-
vok'd Mind, carry us to? And indeed here I saw Reason
for keeping an exceeding Watch over our Passions of eve-
ry Kind, as well those of Joy and Satissaction, as those of
Sorrow and Anger.
We were something disorders by these Extravagancies
among our new Guests for the first Day; but when they
had been retir'd, Lodgings provided tor them as well as
our Ship would allow, and they had slept heartily, as most
of them did, being satigu'd and frighted, they were quite
another Sort of-People the next Day. N o-
Nothing of good Manners, or civil Acknowledg-
ments for the Kindness shewn them was wanting; the
French, 'tis known, are naturally apt enough to exceed that
way: The Captain and one of the Priests came to me the
next Day, and deiiring to speak with me and my Nephew,
the Commander, began to consult with us what should be
done with them; and first they told us, that as we had
saved their Lives, so all they had was little enough for a
Return to us for the Kindness received. The Captain said,
. they had saved some Money and some Things of Value in
their Boats, catch'd hastily out of the Flames; and if we
would accept it, they were ordered to make an Offer of it
all to us-; they only desir'd to be set on Shore somewhere in
our Way, where.if possible.tbey might get Passage to France.
, M y Nephew was for accepting their Money at first
Word, and to consider what to do with them afterwards;
but I over-rul'd him in that Part, for I knew what it was
to be set on Shore in a strange Country; and if the Portugal
Captain, that took me up at Sea, had serv'd me so, and
took all I had for my Deliverance, I must have starv'd, or
. have been as much a Slave at the Brasils, as I had been in
BArbary, the being sold to a Mahometan only excepted; and
perhaps a. l'ortugtteze is not much a better Master than a
J;*rk,"\T not jn\ some-.fases a much worse.
; I therefore told the French Captain, that we had
taken them up in their Distress, it was true; but that it was
our Duty to do so, as we were Fellow-Creatures, and as
we would desire to be so delivered, if we were in the like
°J, anyt otjjfir^Extrexnity; that we had done nothing for
therW but what we believed they would have done for us,
if we had been in their Cafe, and they in ours; but that
we took them up.to.save them, not to plunder them, and
i^. would.be a most barbarous Thing to take that Little from
them which they had saved out of the Fire, and then set
them on Shore and leave them; that this would be first ro
save them frrm Death, and then kill them ourselves; save
them from drowning, and abandon them to starving; and
therefore I would not let the least Thing be taken from
them: As to setting them on Shore, I told them indeed,
that was an exceeding Difficulty to us, for that the Ship
was bound to the Bast-Indies; and tho' we were driven out
of our Course to the Westward a very great Way, which
perhaps was directed by Heaven on purpose for their Deli-
verance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully t* change
L
bar Voyage on this particular Account; nor could my Ne-
phew, the Captain, answer it to the Freighters, with whom
he was under Charter-Party to pursue his Voyage by the
Way of Brafil; and all I knew we could do for them, Was
to put our selves in the Way of meeting with other Ships
homeward-bound from the Weft-Indies, and get them Pas-
sage, if possible, to England or France.
The first Part of the Propofal was so generous and kind,
they could not but be very thankful for it; but they were
in a very great Consternation, especially the Passengers, at
the Notion of being carry'd away to the Eafl-Indies; they
then intreated me, that seeing I was driven so far to the
Westward, before I met with them, I would at least keep
on the fame Course to the Banks of Newfound-land, where
it was probable I might meet with some Ship or Sloop
that they might hire to cany them back to Canada, from
whence they came.
I thought this was but a reasonable Request on their
Part, and therefore I inclin'd to agree to it; for indeed I
consider'd, that to carry this whole Company to the East-
Indies, would not only be an intolerable Severity to the
poor People, but would be ruining our whole Voyage by
devouring all our Provisions; so I thought it no Breach of
Charter-Party, but what an unforeseen Accident made ab-
solutely necessary to us, and in which no one could fay we
were to blame; for the Laws of God and Nature would
have forbid, that we should refuse to take up two Boats
full of People in such a distress'd Condition; and the Na-
ture of the Thing as well respecting ourselves as the poor
People, oblig'd us to set them on Shore some where or
other, for their Deliverance; so I consented that we would
carry them to Newfound-land, if Wind and Weather would
permit, and if not, that I would carry them to Martinho
in the Weft-Indies.
The Wind continued fresh Easterly, but the Weather
pretty good; and as it had blowed continually in the Points
between N. E. and S. E. a long time, we missed several Op-
portunities of sending them to France ; for we met several
Ships bound to Europe, whereof two were French from
St. Christopher's; but they had been so long beating up against
the Wind, that they durst take in no Passengers for fear of
Wanting Provisions for the Voyage, as well for themselves
as fbr those they should take in; so we were oblig'd to go
on. It was about a Week after this that we made the
Banks
125)
Banks of Newfound-land, where, to shorten my Story, we
put all our French People on board a Bark, which they
hir'd at Sea there, to put them on Shore, and afterwards to
carry them to trance, if they could get Provision to victual
themselves with: When, I fay, all the French went on
Shore, I should remember that the young Priest I spoke of,
hearing *ve were bound to the East-Indies, desir'd to go the
Voyage with us, and to be set on Shore on the Coast of
Coromandel: I readily agreed to that, for I wonderfully
lik'd the Man, and had very good Reason, as will appear
afterwards; also four of the Seamen enter'd themselves on
our Ship, and prov'd very useful Fellows.
F ro m hence we directed our Course for the West-Indies,
steering away S. and S. by E. for about 10 Days together,
sometimes little or no Wind at all, when we met with
another Subject for our Humanity to work upon, almost as
deplorable as that before.
I t was in the Latitude of 27 Degrees f Minutes N. and
the 19th Day of March, 1694-7, when we 'spy'daSail, our;
Course S. E. and by S. We soon perceiv'd it was a large.
Vessel, and that she bore up to us, but could not at first
know what to make of her, 'till after coming a little nearer,1
we found she had lost her Main-Top-mast, Foremast and
Boltfprir, and presently she fires a Gun as a Signal of Di-
stress; the Weather was pretty good, Wind at N. N.W. a
fresh Gale, and we soon came to speak with her.
W e found her a Ship of Bristol, bound home from Bar-
badoes, but had been blown out of the Road at Barbadoes,
a few Days before she was ready to fail, by a terrible Hurri-
cane, while the Captain and Chief Mate were both gone
on Shore; so that, beside the Terror of the Storm, they
were but in an indifferent Case for good Artists to bring the
Ship home: They had been already nine Weeks at Sea, aad
had met with another terrible Storm after the Hurricane
was over, which had blown them quite out of their Know-
ledge to the Westward, and in which they lost their Masts,
as above; they told us, they expected to have seen the Ba-
hama Islands, but were then driven away again to the
South-East, by a strong Gale of Wind at N. N. W. the
lame that blew now, and having no Sails to work the Ship
with, but a Main-Course, and a Kind of square Sail upon
a Jury-Fore-Mast, which they had set up, they could not
lie near the Wind, but were endeavouring to stand away
for the Cmurits.
But that which was worst of. al!, was, that they were
almost starved for want of Provisions, besides the Fatigues
they had undergone; their Bread and Flesh was quite gone,
they had not an Ounce left in the Ship, and had had none
for 11 Days ; the only Relief they had, was, their Water
was not all spent, and they had about half a Barrel ot
Flower left ; they had Sugar enough ; some Succades or
Sweet-Meats they had at first, but they were devoured,
and they had seven Casks of Rum.
There was a Youth and his Mother, and a Maid-Servant,
on board, who were going Passengers, and thinking the
Ship was ready to sail, unhappily came on board the
Evening before the Hurricane began, and having.no Pro-
visions of their own left, they were in a more deplorable
Condition than the rest; for the Seamen, being reduced to
such an extreme Necessity themselves, had no Compassion,
we may be sure, for the poor Passengers; and they were
indeed in a Condition that their Misery is very hard to
describe.
I had, perhaps, not known this Part, if my Curiosity
had not led me, the Weather being sair, and the Wind aba-
ted, to go on board the Ship: The Second Mate, who upon
this Occasion commanded the Ship, had been on board our
Ship, and he told me indeed, that they had three Paflengers
in the great Cabin, that they were in a deplorable Condition;
nay, says he, I believe they are dead, for I have heard no-
thing ot them for above two Days ; and I was afraid to
enquire after them, said he, for I had nothing to relieve them
with.
We immediately apply'd ourselves to give them what
Relief we could spare ; and indeed I had so sar over-ruled
Things with my Nephew, that I would have victualled
them, tho' we had gone away to Virginia, or any Part of
the Coast of America, to have supplied ourselves; but there
was no Necessity for that.
But now they were in a new Danger; for they were
afraid of eating too much, even of that little we gave them;
the Mate or Commander brought six Men with him in his
Boat; but these poor Wretche; looked like Skeletons, and.
were so weak, they could hardly sit to their Oars : The
Mate himself was very ill, and half-starved; for he declared
he had reserved nothing from the Men, and went Share
and Share alike with them, in every bit they eat.
I
1 cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set Meat be-
fore him immediately, and he had not eaten three Mouth-
''fuls before he began to be &*- and out of order; so he
stopt% while, and our Surgeon mixeu Jwrn UP seething
with some Broth, which he (aid would be to tyiul
Food and Physick; and after he had'taken it, he grew bet-
ter: In the mean time, I forgot not the Men; I ordered
Victuals to be given them, and the poor Creatures rather
devoured than eat it; they were-so exceeding hungry, that
-they were in a kind ravenous, and had no Command of
themieivCS >, and two of them eat with so much Greedi-
ness, that they were in danger of their Lives the next
Morning. .'
Tbe Sight of these People's Distress was very moving
to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible Prospect
of at my first coming on Shore in my Island, where 1 had
not the least Mouthful of Food, or any Prospect of pro-
curing any;. besides the hourly Apprehension 1 had of being
made the Food of other Creatures. But all the while the
Mate was thus relating to me the miserable Condition of
the Ship's Company, I could not put out of my Thought
the Story he had told me of the three poor Creatures in
the great Cabin, (fix.) the Mother, her Son, and the Maid-
Servant, whom he had heard nothing ol for two or three
Days; and whom he seemed to confess they had wholly neg-
lected, their own Extremities being so great ; by which I
understood, that they had really given them no Food ac
all, and that therefore they must be perished, and be ali
lying dead perhaps on the Floor, or Deck of the Cabin.
As I therefore kept the Mate, whom we then called Cap-
tain, on board with his Men to refresh them, so I also for-
got not the starving Crew that were left on board, but or-
dered my own Boat to go on board the Ship, and with my
Mate and twelve Men to carry them a Sack of Bread, and
four or five Pieces of Bee's to boil. Our Surgeon charged
the Men to cause the Meat to be boiled while they stay'd, and
to keep Guard in the Cook-room, to prevent the Mens
taking it to eat raw, or taking it Out of the Pot before it was
'well boiled, and then to give every Man but a little at atime;
and by this Caution he preserved the Men, who would
otherwise have killed themselves, with that very Food that
was given them on purpose to save their Lives.
At the same time, I ordered the Mate to go into the
great Cabin, and fee what Condition the poor Passengers
B * were
were in, and if they were alive, to comfort them, and give
them what Refreshment was proper; and the Surgeon gave
him a large Pitcher with some of the prepared Broth which
he had given the fc&s that was on board, and which he did
not aiituimi would restore them gradually.
i w a s not fatisfied with this; but, as I said above, hav-
ing a great Mind to fee the Scene ot Misery, which I knew
the Ship itself would present me with, in a more lively
Manner than I could have it by Report, I took the Captain of
the Ship, as we now called him, with me, and went my
self a little after in their Boat.
I found the poor Men on board almost in a Tumult -
to get the Victuals out of the Boiler before it was ready:
But my Mate observed his Order, and kept a good Guard
at the Cook-room Door; and the Man he placed there,
after using all possible Persuasion to have Patience, kept
them off by Force: However, he caused some Bisket Cakes
to be dipped in the Pot, and softened them with the Li-
quor of the Meat, which they call Brewis, and gave them
every one One, to stay their Stomachs, and told them it
was for their own Safety that he was obliged to give them
but a little at a time: But it was all in vain, and had I not
come on board, and their own Commander and Officers
with me, and with good Words, and some Threats also ot
giving them no more, I believethey would have broke into
the Cook-room by Force, and tore the Meat out of the
Furnace; for Words are indeed of very small Force to a
hungry Belly: However we pacify'd them, and fed them
gradually and cautiously for the first Time, and the next time
gave them more, and at last silled their Bellies, and the Men
did well enough.
B u t the Misery of the poor Passengers in the Cabin was
of another Nature, and far beyond the rest; for as, first, the
Ship's Company had so little for themselves, it was but too
true that they had at first kept them very low, and at last
totally neglected them; so that for six or seven Days, it
might be iajd, they had really had no Food at all, and for
several Days before, very little. The poor Mother, who,
as the first Mate reported, was a Woman of good Sense and
good Breeding, had spared all she could get so affectionately
for her Son, that at last she intirely sunk under it: And
when the Mate of our Ship went in, she lat upon the Floor
or Deck, with her Back up against the Sides, between two
Chairs, which weje Ush'd fast, and her Head funk in be-
tween
tween her Shoulders, like a Corpse, tho' not quite dead.
My Mate said all he could to revive and encourage her, and
with a Spoon put some Broth into her Mouth; she open-
ed her Lips, and lifted up one Hand, but could not speak;
vet she understood what he said, and made Signs to him,
intimating, that it was too late for her, but pointed to her
Child, as if she would have said, they should take Care
of him.
However the Mate, who was exceedingly mov'd with
the Sight, endeavour'd to get some of the Broth into her
Mouth; and, as he said, got two or three Spoonfuls down,
tho' I question whether he could be sore of it or not: But
it was too late, and she dy'd the same Night.
The Youth, who was prefer v'd at the Price of his most
affectionate Mother's Life, was not fo sar gone; yet he lay in
a Cabin-bed as one stretch'd eut, with hardly any Life left
in him, he had.a Piece of an old Glove in his Mouth, hav-
ing eaten up the rest of it; however, being young, and
having more Strength than his Mother, the Mate got some-
thing down his Throat, aud he began sensibly to revive,
though by giving him some time after but two or three
Spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and brought ic
up again.
But the next Care was the poor Maid; she lay all along
upon the Deck, hard by her Mistress, and just like one
that had sallen down with an Apoplexy, and struggled for
Life: Her Limbs were distorted, one of her Hands was
claso'd round the Frame of the Chair, and she grip'd it sa
hard, that we could not easily make her let go; her other
Arm lay over her Head, and her Feet lay both together,
set sast against the Frame of the Cabin-table; in short, she
lay just like one in the last Agonies of Death; and yet she
was alive too.
THt poor Creature was not only starved with Hunger,
and terrify'd with the Thoughts of Death; but, as the Men
told us afterwards, was broken-hearted for her Mistress,
whom she saw dying two or three Days before, and whom
she lov'd most tenderly.
W e knew not what to do with this poor Girl; for when
our Surgeon, who was a Man of very great Knowledge
and Experience, and with great Application recover'd her,
as to Life, he had her upon his Hand as to her Senses, for
Ifce was little less than distracted for a considerable Time
after j at shall appear presently.
B z Who-
1281
Whoever shall read these Memorandums, must be de--
. sired to consider, that Visits at Sea are not like a Journey
into the Country, where sometimes People stay a Week or
a Fortnight at a Place. Our Business was to relieve this
distreflul Ship's Crew, but not lie by for them; and tho'
they were willing to steer the same Course with us for
some Days, yet we could carry no Sail to keep Pace with
a Ship that had no Masts: However, as their Captain beg-
ged of us to help him to set up.a Main-Top-Mast, and a
kind of Top-Mast to his Jury-Fore-Mist; we did, as it
were, lie by him for three or four Days, and then having
given him five Barrels of Beef, a Barrel of Pork, two Hogs-
heads of Bisket, and a Proportion of Peas, Flour, and
what other Things we could spare; and taking three Casks
of Sugar, some Kara, and some Pieces of Eight of them
for Satissaction, we left them, taking on board with us,
at their own earnest Request, the Youth, and the Maid,
and all their Goods.
The young Lid was about seventeen Years of Age, a
pretty, well-bred, modest, and sensible Youth; greatly de-
jected with the Loss of his Mother, and, as it seems, had
lost his Father but a few Months before at Barbados. He
begg'd of the Surgeon to speak to me, to take him out of
the Ship; for he said the cruel Fellows had murder'd his
Mother; ami indeed so they had, that is to fey, f ajpvely; for
they might have spar'd a small Sustenance to the poor help-
less Widow, that might have preserv'd her Life, though it
had been but just to keep her alive. -But Hunger knows
no Friend, no Relation, no Justice, no Right, and there-
fore is remorseless, and capable of no Compassion.
The Surgeon told him how sar we were going, and
how it would carry him away from all his Friends, and put
him perhaps in as bad Circumstances almost as we found
them in-, that is to lay, starving in the World. He said he
matter'd not whither he went, if he was but deliver'd front
-the terrible Crew that he was among: That the Captain
( by which he meant me, for he could know nothing of
my Nephew ) had iav'd his Life, and he was sore would
not hurt him; and as for the Maid, he was sore, if she came
to herseif, she would be very thankful for it, let us carry
them whither we would. The Surgeon represented the Case
so affectionately to me, that I yielded, and we took them
both on board with all their Goods, except eleven Hog-
sheads of Sugar, which could not be removed or come at;
and

and as the Youth had a Bill of Lading for them, I made
his Commander sign a Writing, obliging himself to go, as
soon as he came to Bristol, to one Mr. Rogers, a Merchanr
there, to whom the Youth faid he was related, and to
deliver a Letter which I wrote to him, and all the Goods
he had belonging to the deceased Widow; which I sup-
pose was not done, for I could never learn that the Ship
came to Bristol, but was, as is most probable, lost at Sea,-
being in so difabled a Condition, and so far from any Land,
that I am or Opinion, the first Storm she met with after-
wards, she might founder in the Sea, for she was leaky, ami
had Damage in her Hold when we met with her.
I was now in the Latitude of 19 Deg. ji Min. and
had hitherto had a tolerable Voyage as to Weather, though
at first the Winds had been contrary. I shall trouble no'
body with the little Incidents of Wind, Weather, Currents.
&c. on the rest of our Voyage; but shortning my Story
for the fake of what is to follow, shall observe that I came
to my old Habitation, the Island, on the 10th of April,
169f. It was with no small Difficulty that I found the
Place; for as I came to it, and went from it before, on the
South and East Side of the Island, as coming from the
-Brafils, so now coming in between the Main and the Island,
and having no Chart for the Coast, nor any Land-Mirk",
I did not know it when I faw it, or know whether I faw
it or no.
W e beat about a great while, and went on Shore on
several Islands in the Mouth of the great River O. oonoque,
but none for my Purpose; only this I learn'd by my
Coasting the Shore,- that I was under one great Mistake be-
fore, viz. that the Continent which I thought I faw, from
the Island I liv'd in, was really no Continent, but a long
Island, or rather a Ridge of Islands, reaching from one to
the other Side of the extended Mouth of that great River,
and that the Savages who came to my Island, were not
properly those which we call Caribbees, but Islanders and
other Barbarians of the fame ICind, who inhabited some-
thing nearer to our Side thanthe rest.
I n shorr, I visited several of these Islands to no Purpose;
some I lound were inhabited, and some were not. On one
of them I found some Spaniards, and thought they had
liv'd there; but speaking with them, found tluy had A
Sioop lay in a small. -Creek hard by, and that they c;ime
thither to- make 5ak,:aud-io catch some Pearl Muscles if
. -: B 3 that
C 30]
they could; but they belong'd to the Isle de Tr'midai,
which lay farther North, in the Latitude of 10 and 11
Degrees.
Thus coasting from one Island to another, sometimes
with the Ship, sometimes with the French Mm's Shalloup,
(which we had found a convenient Boat, and therefore*
kept her with their very good Will;) at length I came fair
on the South Side of my Island, and I presently knew the
very Countenance of the Place; so I brought the Ship fafe
to an Anchor, Broadside with the little Creek where was
nay old Habitation.
A s soon as I faw the Place, I call'd for Friday, and askM
him, If he knew where he was? He look'd about a little,
and presently, clapping his Hands, cry'd; © yes, O there,
O yes, O there, pointing to our old Habitation, and fell a
dancing and capering- like a mad Fellow, and I had much
ado- to. keep him from jumping into the Sea, to swim a-
shore to the Place.
Well, FriJay,' faid I, do you think we shall find any
Body here or no? And what do you think, shall we see
your Father? The Fellow stood mute as a Stock a good
while; but when I nam'd his Father, the poor affectionate
Creature look'd dejected, and I could see the Tears run
down his Face very plentifully. What is the Matter, Friday,
said I? Are you troubled because you may see your Father?
No, no, says he, shaking his Head, no see him more, n»
ever more see again; Why so, faid I, "Friday, hon do you knots
that? O no, O no, fays Friday, he long ago die; long ago,
he much old Man. Well, well, said I, Friday, you don't
know; butshall we see any one else then? The Fellow, it
seems, had better Eyes than I, and he points just to the Hill
above my old House; and tho' we lay half a League off, he
cries out, Me sec! me see! yes, yes, me see muck Man
there, and there, and there. I look'd, but 1 could fee no
body, no not with a Perspective Glass; which was, I sup-
pose, because I could not hit the Place, for the Fellow was
right, as I found upon Enquiry the next Day, and there
were five or six Men altogether, stood to look at the Ship,
not knowing what to think of us.
As soon as Friday had told me he faw People, I caus'd
the English Ancient to be spread, and fir'd three Guns, to
give them notice we were Friends; and in about half a
Quarter of an Hour after, we perceiv'd a Smoak rise from
the Side ot the Creek; fe I immediately order'd a Boat out,
taking
till
faking Friday with me, and banging out a white Flag, of a
Flag of Truce, I went directly on Shore, taking with mi
the young Frier I mention'd, to whom 1 had told the
whole Story of my living there, and the Manner of it, ami
every Particular both of myself, and those that I left there;
and who was on that Account extremely desirous to go
with me. We had besides about sixteen M*n very well
arm'd, if we had found any new Guests there' which we
did not know of; but we had no need of Weapons.-
As we went on Shore upon the Tide of Flood, near high
Water, we row'd directly into the Creek; and the first Mart,
I fix'd my Eye upon, was the Spaniard, whose Life I had
fev'd, and whom I knew by his Face perfectly well; as to his
Habit, I shall describe it afterwards. I order'd no body to
go on Shore at first but myself, but there was no keeping
Friday in the Boat; for the affectionate Creature had spy'j
his Father at a Distance, a good way off of the Spaniards,
where indeed I saw nothing of him; and it they had not
let him go on Shore, he would have jump'd into the Sea.
He was no sooner on Shore, but he flew away to his
Father like an Arrow out of a Bow. It would have made
any Man shed Tears in spite of the firmest Resoluion,
to have seen the first Transports of this poor Fellow's Joy
when he came to his Father; how he embrae'd him, kits'd
him, strok'd his Face, took him up in his Arms, set him
down upon a Tree, and lay down by him; then stood and
look'd at him, as any one would look at a strange Picture,
for a Quarter of an Hour together; then lay down on the
Ground, and stroke his Legs, and kiss them, and then get
up again, and stare at him; one would have thought the
Fellow bewitch'd: But it would have made a Dog laugh
to fee how the next Day his Passion run out another
way: In the Morning he walk'd along the Shore, to and—
again, with his Father, several Hours, always leading him
by the Hand, as if he had been a*Lady; and every now
and then would come to fetch something or other for him
tw the Boat, either a Lump of Sugar, or a Dram, a Bisket,
or something or other that was good. In the Afternoon
his Frolicks run another way; for then he would set the
old Man down upon the Ground, and dance about him,
and made a Thousand antick Postures and Gestures; and all
the while he did this, he would be talking to him, and
telling him one Story or another of his Travel, and of
what had happen'd to him Abroad, to divert him. In
0 4 stwrt,
[ s«-J
short, if the fame filial Affection was to be found in Christi-
ans to their Parents, in our Parts of the World, one would
be tempted to fay, there would hardly have been any
Need of the fifth Commandment.
But this is a Digression; I return to my Landing. It
would be endless to take Notice of all the Ceremonies and
Civilities that the Spaniards receiv'd me with. The first
Spaniard, whom, as I faid, I knew very well, was he whose
Life I had fav'd; he came towards the Boat, attended by
one more, carrying a Fhg of Truce also; and he did not
only not know me at first, but he had no Thoughts, no
Notion of its being me that was come, till I spoke to him:
Seignior, faid I, in Portuguese, do you not know me? At
which he spoke not a Word; but giving his Musket to
the Man that was with him, threw his Arms abroad, and
faying something in Spanisli, that I did not perfectly hear,
came forward, and embraced me, telling me he was inexcu-
fable, not to know that Face again, that he had once seen,
as of an Angel from Heaven, sent to fave his Life: He
faid Abundance of very handsome Things, as a well-bred
Spaniard always knows how; and then beckoning to the
Person that attended him, bad him go and call out his
Comrades. He then ask'd me, if I would walk to my old
Habitation, where he would give me Possession of my own?
House again, and where I should see there had been but
mean Improvements; so I walk'd along with him; but
ajas! - I could no more find the Place again, than if I had
never been there; for they had planted so many Trees,
and plac'd them in such a Posture, so thick and close to
one another; and in ten Years Time they were grown so
big, that in short the Place was inaccessible, except by such
Windings and blind Ways, as they themselves only, who
made them, could find./. . ..
I ask'd them, What put them upon all these Fortifica-
tions? He told me, I would fay there was need enough
of it, when they had given me an Account how they had
pais'd their Time since their arriving in the Island, espe-
cially after they had the Misfortune to find that I was
gone: He told me^.he could not but have some Satisfac-
tion in my good Fortune, when he heard that I was gone
in a good Ship, and to my Satisfaction; and that he had
oftentimes, a strong Persuasion, that one Time or other he
should see me again: Bat nothingthat ever be/el him in his
1 . Life,
Life, he said, was so surprizing and afflicting to hiirrrat fifst,
as the Difappointment he was under when he came back
to the Island, and found I was not there.
As to the three Barbarians (To hecall'd them) that were
left behind, and of whom he faid he had a long Story to
tell me; the Spaniards all thought themselves much better
among the Savages, only that their Number was so small.
And, fays he, had they been strong enough, we had been
all long ago in Purgatory; and with that he cross'd him-
self on the Breast: But, Sir, fays he, I hope you will not
be displeased, when I shall tell you how, sore'd by Necessi-
ty, we were oblig'd, for our own Preservation, to difarm
them, and making them our Subjects, who would not be
content with being moderately our Masters, but would be
our Murderers. I answer'd, I was heartily afraid of is
when I left them there; and nothing troubled me at my
parting from the Island, but that they were not come
back, that I -might have put them in Possession of every
Thing first, and left the other in a State of Subjection, as
they deserv'd: But if they had redue'd them to it; I
was very ghd, and should be very far from finding any
Fault with it; for I knew they were a Parcel of re-
fractory, ungovern'd Villains, and were fit for any manner
of Mischief. . / .- i ;.
- "While I was faying this, came the Man whom he
had sent back, and with him eleven Men more: In the
Dress they were in, it was impossible to guess what Na-
tion they were of: But he made all clear both to them
and to me. First he turrfd to me, and pointing to them,
feid, These, Sir, are some ot the Gentlemen who owe
their Lives to you; and then turning to them, and point-
ing to me, he let them know who I was; upon which
they all came up one by one, not as if they had been Sailors
and ordinary Fellows,.and I the like, but really, .as if they
had been Ambassadors of Noblemen, and I a Monarch or
a great Conqueror; their Behaviour wss to the last Degree
obliging and courteous, and yet mix'd with a manly, .ma-
jestick Gravity, which very, well became them; and in
sliort, they had so much mone Manners than I, that I
scarce knew how to receive their Civilities, much less
how to return them in kind. -
The History of their coming to, and Conduct in the
Island, after my going away, is so very remarkable, and
has so many Incidents, which the toimsr Part of my Rcla-
:" B j. tioo-
r 34 3
tion will help to understand, and which will, in most of
the Particulars, refer to that Account I have already given,
that I cannot but commit them with great Delight to the
Reading or those that come after me.
I shall no longer trouble the Story with a Relation in
the first Person, which will put me to the Expence ot ten
Thousmd said I's, and said he's, and he ttldme's, and I told
trim's, and the like; but I shallcollect the Facts historically,
as near as I can gather them out of my Memory from
what they related to me, and from what I'met with4in my.
conversing with them, and with the Place.
I n order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly- as.I
can, I must go back to the Circumstance in which I left
the Island, and which the Persons were in, of whom I am
to speak. And first-it is neceflary to repeat, that I had sent
away Friday's Father and the Spaniard, the two whose
Lives I had rescued from the Savages; I fay, I had sent
them away in a large Canoe to the Main, ms I then thought
it, to fetch over the Spaniards Companions whom he had
left behind him, in order to fave them from the like Cala-
mity that he had been in; and in order to succour them
for the present, and that, if possible, we might together.
find some Way for our Deliverance afterward.
When I sent them away, I had no visible Appearance
of, or the least Room to hope for my own Deliverance
any more than I had twenty. Years before, much less had
I any Fore-knowledge of what after happened, I mean of
an Zngtish- Ship coming on Shore there to fetch me offj.
and it could not but be a very great Surprize to them when
they came back, not only to find that I. was gone, but to..
find three Strangers lesi on the Spot, possessed of all that I
had left behind me, which would otherwise have. been.
their own.
The first Thing, however, which I enquir'd into, that
1 might begin where I left off, was of their own Part».
and I desir'd he would give me a particular Account ot
his Voyage back to his Countrymen with the Boat, when
I sent him to fetch them over. He told me there was lit-
tle Variety in that Part, for nothing remarkable happen'd
to them on the Way; they having very calm Weather, and
a smooth Sea; for his Countrymen, it could not be doubted,
he faid, but that they were over-joy'd to see him: (It seems
he was the principal Man among them; the Captain of the
Vessel they had been shipwreck'd in, basing been- dead
some time) They were, be said, the more surpriaed to see
him, because they knew that he was sallen into the Hands of
the Savagesr who, they were satisfy'd, would devour him,
as they did all the red of their Prisoners; that when he told
them the Story of his Deliverance, and in what Manner
he was furnish'd for carrying them away, it was like a
Dream to them; and their Astonishment, they iaid, was
something like that of Jofifh's Brethren, when he told
them who he was, and told them the Story of his Exalta-
tion in Pharaoh's Court: But when he shewed them the
Arms, the Powder, the Ball, and the Provisions that he
brought them for their Journey or Voyage, they were
restor'd to themselves, took a just Share of the Joy oF
their Deliverance, and immediately prepar'd to come away
with him.
T-h.eir first Business was to get Canoes; and in this
they were obliged not to stick so much upon the honest
Part of it, but to trespass upon their friendly Savages, and
to borrow twr> large Canoes or Periagua's, on pretence on-
going out a Fishing, or for Pleasure.
I n these they came away the next Morning; it seems
they wanted no Time to get themselves ready, tor they had
no Baggage, neither Cloaths, or Provisions, or any Thing in
the World, but what they had on them, and a few Roots to
eat, of which they us'd to make their Bread.
They were in all three Weeks absent, and in that Time,
unluckily for them, I had the Oeasion offer'd for my Es-
cape, as I mention'd in my other Part, and to.get off
from the Island; leaving three of-the most impudent,
harden'd, ungovern'd, disagreeable Villains behind me, that
any Man could desire to meet with, to the poor Spaniards
great Grief and Disappointment, ..you may be sure.
The only just Thing the Rogues did, was, that when
the Spaniards came to Shore, they gave my Letter to them,
and gave them Provisions, and other Relief, as 1 had
order'd them to do; also they gave them the long Paper of.
Directions, which I had left with them, containing the par-
ticular Methods which. I took for managing every Part of
my Life there, the Way. how I baked my Bread, bred up
my tame Goats, and planted my Corn, how I cured'my
Grapes, made my Pots, and, in a Word; every Thing I
did; all this being-written down, they gave to the Spaniards,
two .of. whom understood English well enough ; nor did
they . refuse. to~ accommodate the Spaniard* with any
B 6 thing:
tiling else, for they agreed' very Well for some time;
they gave them an equal Admission into the Hotrfe, or
Cave, and they began to live very sociably; and the Head-
Sfctniard, who had seen pretty much of my Method, and
Friday's Father together, managed all their Affairs ,- for, as
for the 'Englishmm, they did nothing but ramble about the
Island, shoot Parrots, and catch Tortoises, and when they
came Home at Night, the Spaniards provided their Sup-
pers for them.
The Spaniards would have been satisfy'd with this,
would the other but have let them alone, - which, how-
ever, they could not find in their Hearts to do long; but,
like the Dog in the Manger, they would not eat themselves,
and would not let others eat neither: The Differences,
nevertheless, were at first but trivial, and such as arc not
worth relating; but at last it bioke out into open War,
and it begun with all the Rudeness and Insolence that can
be imagined, without Reason, without Provocation, con-
trary to Nature, and indeed, to common Sense; and tho'
it is true, the first Relation of it came from the Spaniards
themselves, whom.I may call the Accusers, yet when I came
to examine the Fellows, they could not deny a Word of it.
But before I come to the Particulars of this Part, I
must Ripply a D ftctin my former I\elat ion; and this
was, that 1 forgot to set down among the rest, That, just
as we were weighing the Anchor to set Sail, there hap-
pen'd a little Quarrel on board our Ship, which I was
afraid once would hive turn'd to a second Mutiny; nor
was it appeas'd, till th; Captain rousing up his Courage,
and taking us all to his Assistance, parted them by Force,
and making two of the most refractory Fellows Prisoners,
he laid them to Iron?; and as they had been active in the
former Disorders, and let sall some ugly dangerous Words
the second Time, he threaten'd to carry them in Irons to
England, and have them hang'd there for Mutiny, and Tun-
ing away with the Ship.
T h 1 s, it seems, though the Captain did not intend to-
do it, fr ighted some other Men in the Ship, and some of
."thcn.1 had put it into the Heads of the rest, that the Cap-
tain" only gave them good Words for the present, till they
fhoulJ come to some Englifi Port, and that then they should
be all put into a Gaol, and try'd for their Lives.
The Mare got Intelligence of this, and acquainted us
with it; u.oa which ir was desir'd, that I> who still
. pasled
pasted for a great Mm among them, should go down
with the Mate, and satisfy the Men, and teil them, that
they might be assured, it they behaved well the rest of
the Voyage, all they had done for the Time past should
be pardon'd. So I went, and, after pasting my Honour's
Word to them, they a pp ear'd easy; and the more so, when
I cr.us'd the two Men, who were in Irons, to be rcleas'd,
and tor^ven.
But this Mutiny had brought us to an Anchor for that
Night, the Wind also salling dm; next Morning we
found, that our two Men, who had been laid in Irons,
had stole each of them a Mufquet, and some other Wea-
pons, what Powder or Shot they had, we know nor; and
had taken the Ship's Pinnace, which was not yet haled up,
and ran away with her to their Companions in Roguery,
on Shore. it
A s soon as we found this, I order'd the Long-boat on-
Shore, with twelve Men and the Mate, and away they
went to seek the Rogues, but they could neither find
them, nor any of the rest; for they all fled into the Woods
when they saw the Boat coming on Shore. The Mate
was once resolv'd, in Justice to their Roguery, to have
destroy'd their Plantations, burnt all their Houshold-stuft'
and Furniture, and left them to shist without it; but hay-
ing no Order, he let all alone, left every thing as they
found it, and bringing the Pinnace away, came on board
without them.
These two Men made their Number five; but the
other three Villains were so much wickeder than these,.
that after they had been two or three Days together,
they turn'd their two New-comers out of Doors to shift
for themselves, and would have nothing to do with them,
-nor could they, for a good while, be persuaded to give
them any Food; as for the Spaniards, they were not yet
come.
When the Spaniards came first on Shore, the Business)
began to go forward; the Spaniards would ave per-
suaded the three English Brutes to have taken in their two
Countrymen again, that, as they said, they might be all
one Family; but they would not hear of it: So the two
poor Fellows liv'd by themselves, and finding nothing but
Industry and Application would make them live comfort-
able, they pirch'd their Tents on the North Shore of the
Island, but a little more to the West, to be out of the
Danger
Danger of the Savxgu, who always landed on the Soft
Parts of the Island.
Here they built them two Huts, one to lodge in, . and
the other to fay up their Magazines and Stores in,-.and the
Spaniards having given them some Cosn<for Seed, and espe-
cially some of the Peas which I had left them, they dug
and planted, and inclos'd, after the Pattern I had set for
them all, and began to live pretty well; their first Crop
of Corn was on the Ground, and though it was but a lit-
tle Bit of Land which they had dug up at first, having
had but a little Time, yet it was enough to relieve them,
and find them with Bread and other Eatables; and one of
the Fellows, being the Cook's Mate of the Ship, was very
ready at making Soup, Puddings, and such other Prepara-
tions, as the Rice and the Milk, and such little Flesh as
they got, furnished him to do.
They were going on in a little thriving Posture, when
the three unnatural Rogues, their own Countrymen toes
in mere Humour, and to insult them, came, and bully'd
them, and told'then), the Island was theirs; that the Go-
vernor, meaning me, had. given them Possession of it,.
and no-body else had any Right to. it, and, damn them,.
they should build no Houses upon their Ground, unless-
they would pay them Rent for them.
The two Men thought they. had jested at first; andask'd
them, to come and fix down, and-fee what fine Houses.
they were, that they had built, and tell them what Rent
they demanded, and one of them merrily told them; If
they were Ground-Landlords, he hop'd, if they built Te-
nements upon the Land, and made Improvements, they
would, according to the Custom of all Landlords, grant
them a long Lease, and bid them go fetch a Scrivener to
draw the Writings. One of the three, damning and raging,
told them, they should sec they were not in Jest; and gor-
ing to a little Place at a Distance, where the honest Men.
had made a Fire to dress their Victuals, he takes a Fire-
brand, and claps it to the Out-side of their Hut, and very
fairly set it on . fire ; and it would have been all burnt down
in a few Minutes, if one of the two had- not run to the
Fellow, thrust him away, and trod the Fire out with his
Beet, and that not without some Difficulty too.
T h b -Fellow was in such a-Rage at the honest. Man/s
thrusting him. away, that he. turn'd upon. him with a Pole
be had injiis Hand j and bad not the Man. avoided the Blow
very nimbly, and run into the Hut, he had ended his
Days at once; his Comrade seeing the Danger they were
both in,- run in after him, and immediately they came
both out with their Mufquets; and the Man that was first
struck at with the Pole, knock'd the Fellow down, who
begun the Quarrel, with the Stock of the Mulquet, and
that before the other two could come to help him; and
then seeing the rest- come at them, they stood together,
and presenting the other Ends of their Pieces to them,
bad them stand off.
The other had Fire-arms with- them toobut one of
the two honest Men, bolder than his Comrade, and made
desperate by his . Danger, told . them, If they offer'd to move
Hand or Foot, they were all dead Men, and boldly com-
manded them. to lay down their Arms. They did not, in*-
deed, lay down their Arms; but seeing hip resolute, it
brought them to a Parley, and they consented to take
their wounded Man with them, and be gone; and indeed,
it seems the Fellow was wounded sufficiently with the
Blow; however, they were.much in the Wrong, since they-
had the Advantage, that. they did not difarm them effectu-
ally, as they. might have done, and have gone immediate-
ly to the Spaniards, and given them an. Account how the
Rogues had treated them) for the three Villains study'd
nothing but Revenge, and every. Day. gave them seme In-
timation that they. did so.
But not to.croud this Past with.an Account of the
lefler Part of their Rogueries, such as treading down their
Corn, shooting three young Kids, and a She-Goat, which
the poor Men had got. to.breed up tame for their Store;
and, in a Word, plaguing them Night and Day- in this
Manner, it forced the two Men to such a Desperation, that
they resolv'd to fight them all three the first Time they
had a fair Opportunity; in order to this they resolv'd to go.
to the Castle, as they call'd it, that was my old Dwelling,.
where the three Rogues and the Spaniards all liv'd together,
at that Time; intending to have a fair Battle, and the Spani-
ards should stand by to see fair Play.;- so they got up in the
Morning before Day, and came to the Place, and.call'd the
Englishman by their Names, telling a Spaniard that answer'd,
that they waneed-to speak with them.
It happened that the Day before two of the Spaniards,
having been,iu the Woods, had seen one of the two Englisk-
flw, whom, for Distinction, I call xhcHarust Men > and he had
made
[ 40 3
Ufage they had met with from their three Countrymen,
and how they had ruin'd their Plantation, and destroy'd
their Corn, that they had labour'd so hard to bring forward,
and kill'd the Milch-Goat, and rheir three Kids, which was
all they had provided for their Sustenance; and that if he
and his Friends, meaning the Spaniards. did not assist: t.iem
again, they should be staiv'd. When the Spaniards came
home at Night, and they were all at Supper, he took the
Freedom to reprove the three Englishmen,- though in gentle
and manrerly Terms, and ask'd them* how they could be-
so cruel, they being harmless inoffenlive Fellows, and that
they were putting themselves in a Way to soblist-by their
Labour, and that it had.eost them a great deal of Pams to
bring Things to such a Perfection as they had?
One of the Englishmen return'd ver/. briskly, What
had they to do there? That they came on Shore with-
out Leave, and they should not plant or build upon the
Island, it was none of their Ground. Why, fays the Spa-
niard very calmly, Seignior Inglese, they must not sttirze.
.The Englishman replyVt, like a true rough-hewn Tarpaulin,
They might starve; and be damn'd, they should not plant,
nor build in that Place. But what must they do thenr
Seignior, fays the Spaniard.» Another of the Brutes return'd,
Do! D -n them, they should be Servants, and work
for them. But hoto can you. expect that of themI They are
net bought with your Money; you have no Right to make
them Servants. The Englishman answer'd, The Island
was theirs, the Governor had given it to them, and no
Man h?d any thing to do there but themselves; and with
-that lwore by his Maker, that they would go and burn
all their new Huts; they should build none upon their
-Land; -'- 1 .'' .' ' v
Why, Seignior, fays the Spaniard, by the [ame Rule we
must be your servants toe. Ay, fays the bold Dog, and so
you shall too, before we have done with you, mixing two
or three G—d D—mme's in the proper Intervals of his
Speech; the 'Spaniard only smil'd at that, and-.made him
fio Answer. However,' this Kttle Discourse had heated
.them; and starting up, one fays to the other, I think it
was he they call'd Will. Atkins, £gme, sack, let us go and
have t'other Brush With them; we'll demolish their Castle*
I'll warrant you; they shall plant no Colony in our Dr>
{ninionsj
Upon this, they were all trooping away, with' every
Man a Gun, a Pistol, and a Sword, and mutter'd some in-
solent Things among themselves, of what they would do
to the Spaniards too, when Opportunity offer'd; but the
Spaniards, it seems, did not so perfectly understand them,
as to know all the Particulars, only, that in general,
they threaten'd them hard for taking the two Englishmen;-
Part.
Whither they went, or how they bestowed their
Time that Evening, the Spaniards said, they did not know;
but it seems they wander'd about the Country, Part of the
Night, and then lying down in the Place which I used to
call my Bower, they were weary, and over-flept them-
selves. The Case was this; they had resolv'd to stay till
Midrnight; and so to take the poor Men when they were
asleep; and, they acknowledged it afterwards, intended to
set Fire to their Huts while they were in them, and ei-
ther burn them in them, or murder them as they came
out: And as Malice seldom steeps very sound, it was very
strange they should not have been kept waking.
However, as the two Men had also a Design upon
them, as I have said, tho' a much sairer one than that of
Burning and Murdering, it happen'd, and very luckily for
them alii that they were up and gone abroad, before the
bloody-minded Rogues came to their Huts. 1
W h en they came thither, and found the Men gone, At-
kins, who it seems was the forwardest Man, call'd out to-
bis Comrades, ha' Jack, here's the Nest; but &—n them,
the Birds are flown: They mused a while to. think
what should be the Occasion of their being gone abroad so
soon, and suggested presently, that the Spaniards had given
them Notice of it; and with that they shook Hands, and
swore to one another, that they would be revenged of the
Spaniards. As soon as they had made this bloody Bargain,
they fell to work with the poor Mens Habitation, they
did not set Fire indeed to any thing, but they pull'd down
both their Houses, and pull'd them so Limb from Limb,
that they left not the least Stick standing, or scarce any
Sign on the Ground where they stood; they tore all their
little collected Houshold-sluff in Pieces, and threw every
thing about in such a Manner, that the poor Men found,
afterwards, some of their Things a Mile off. from their
Habitation. . . . ...
Trees which the poor Men had planted; pull'd up the In-
closure they had made to secure their Cattle and their
Corn; and, in a Word, fack'd and plunder'd every thing,
as completely as as a Hoard of Tartars would have done.
The two Men were at this Juncture gone to find them
©ut, and had resolved to fight them where-ever they had
been, though they were but two to three: So that, had
they met, there certainly would have been Blood shed
among them.; for they were all very stout resolute Fellows,
t» give them their Due.
But Providence took more Care to keep them asunder,
than they themselves could do to meet,- for, as they had
dogg'd one another, when the three were gone thither,
the two were here; and afterwards when the two went
back to find them, the three were come to the old Habi-
tation again.; we shall fee their differing Conduct presently.
When the three came back, like furious Creatures, flufti'd
-with the Rage which the Work they had been about put
them into, they came up to the Spaniards, and told them
what they had done, by way of Scoff and Bravado; and
one of (hem stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as if
they had been a Couple of Boys at play, takes hold of his
Hat, as it was upon bis Head, and giving it a Twirl about,
fleering in his Face, fays he to him, And you, Seignior
Jack Spaniard, /hall have the /ami Sauce, tf you do not
mend- your Manners. The Spaniard, who though a quiet
civil Man, was as brave, as a Man could be- delired to be,
and withal a strong well-made Man; Jook'd steadily at him,
for a good while, and then, and having no Weapon in his
Hand, slept gravely up to him, and with one Blow of his
Fist knock'd him down, as an Ox is sell'd with a Pole-Ax;
at which one of the Rogues, insolent as the firsts fir'd his
Pistol at the Spaniard immediately; he miss'd- his Body in-
deed, for the Bullets went through his Hair, but one of
them touch'd the Tip of his Ear, and he bled pretty much.
The Blood made the Spaniards believe, he was more hurt than
he really was, and that put him into some Heat, for before
he acted all in a perfect Calm; but now resolving to' go
through with his Work, he stoop'd and took the Fellow's
Musket whom he had knock'd down, and was just going
to. shoot the Man. who had fir'd at him; when the rest of
the Spaniards being in the Cave, came out, and calling to

s43]
him not to shoot, theysteptin, secur'd the other two, and
took their Arms from them.
Wbeh they were thus disarm'd, and found they had
made all the Spaniards their Enemies, as well as their own
Countrymen, they begin to cool, and giv.ing the Spaniards
better Words, would have had their Arms again; but the
Spaniards considering the Feud that was between them and
the other two Englishmen, and that it would be the best
Method they could take, to. keep them from one another,
told them they would do them no harm; and if they would
live peaceably, they would be very willing to assist and so.
ciate with them, as they did before, but that they could
not think of giving them their Arms again, while they
appear'd so resolv'd to do Mischief with them to their own
Countrymen, and had even threatned them all to. make
them their Servants.
The Rogues were now more capable to hear Reason,
than to act Reason; but being refused their Arms, they
went raving away, and raging like Madmen, threatning
what they would do, though they had no Fire-arms: But
the Spaniards despising their Threatning, told them they
s43]
I^WBfW CSttsejTor if they did, they would shoot them,
as they would da ravenous Beasts, where-ever they found
them}. and if they fell into their Hands alive,. they would
certainly. be hang'd. However, this was far from cooling
them; but away they went raging and swearing like Furies
of Hell. As soon. as they were gone, came back the two
Men in Passion and Rage enough also, though of another
Kind; for having been at their Plantation, and finding it
all demolifh'd and destroyed, as above, it will easily be sup-
posed they had Provocation enough; they could scarce have
room to tell their Tale, the. Spaniards were so eager to tell
them theirs; and it was strange enough to find that three
Men should thus buUy Nineteen, and receive no Punish-
ment at all.
The Spaniards indeed despised them, and especially hav-
ing thus disarm'd them, made light of all their Threat-
nings; but the two.Englishmen resolved to have their Re-
medy against them, what Pains soever it cost to find them
out.
But the Spaniards interposed. here too, and told them,
that as they were already disarm'd) they could not consent
that they (the Twa) should pursue- them with Eire-arms,
and perhaps kill them; but, said the grave Spaniard, who
was their Governor, we will endeavour to make tbem
do you Justice, if you will leave it to us; for as there is
no doubt but they will come to us again when their Pas-
sion is over, being not able to subsist without our Assist-
ance, we promise you to make no Peace with them,
without having a full Satissaction for you; and upon this
Condition we hope you will promise to use no Violence
with them, other than in your own Defence.
The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly,
and with great Reluctance; but the Spaniards protested,
they did it only to keep them from Bloodshed, and to
make all easy at last; for, said they, we are not so many
of us, here is Room enough for us all, and it is great Pity
we should not be all good Friends; at length they did con-
sent, and waited for the Issue of the Thing, living for
some Days with the Spaniards, for their own Habitation-
was destroyed.
I n about five Days Time the three Vagrants, tir'd with
wandring, and almost starv'd with Hunger, having chiefly
Jiv'd on Turtles Eggs all that while, came back to the
-Grove; and finding my Spaniard, who, as I have said,
.was the Governor, and two more with him walking by
the Side of the Creek; they came up in a very submissive
humble Manner, and begg'd to be received again into the
"Family. The Spaniards used them civilly, but told them,
they had acted so unnaturally by their Countrymen, and
so very grossly by them, (the Spaniards) that they could
not come to any Conclusion, without consulting the two
Xnglislimen and the rest; but however, they would go to
"them and discourse about it, and they should know in
half an Hour. It may be guess'd, that they were very
hard put to it; for it seems, as they were to wait this half
Hour for an Answer, they begg'd he would send them
out some Bread in the mean Time, which he did, and sent
them at the same Time a large Piece of Goat's Flesh, and
a boil'd Parrot, which they eat very heartily, for they were
hungry enough.
After half an Hour's Consultation they were call'd in,
and a long Debate had about them, their two Countrymen
charging them with the Ruin of all their Labour, and a.
Design to murder them; all which they own'd before,
and therefore could not deny now; upon the whole, the
-Spaniards acted the Moderators between them} and as they
had oblig'd the two Englishmen not to hurt the three, while
they were naked and unarmed, so they now oblig'd the
three to go and rebuild their Fellows two Huts, one to be
of the fame Dimensions, and the other larger than they
were before; also to fence their Ground again, where
they had pull'd up the Fences, plant Trees in the Room of
thole puli'd up, dig up the Land again for planting Corn,
where they had fpoil'd it; and in a Word, to restore every
Thing in the fame State, as they found it, as near as
they could, for intirely it could not be, the Season for the
.Corn, and the Growth of the Trees and Hedges, not be-.
ing possible to be recover'd.
Well, they submitted to all this; and as they had Plen-
ty of Provisions given them all the while, they grew very
orderly, and the whole Society began to live pleafantly
and agreeably together again; only that these three Fel-
lows could never be persuaded to work; I mean, not for .
themselves, except now and then a little, just as they
pleased; however, the Spaniards told them plainly, that if
they would but live sociably and friendly together, and
.stuidy in the whole the Good of the Plantations they would
be content to work for them, and let them walk about
and be as idle as they pleased; and thus having liv'd pretty
-well together for a Month or two, the Spaniards gave
them Arms again, and gave them Liberty to go abroad
with them as before. -.
I t was not above a Week after they had these Arms,'
and went abroad, but the ungrateful Creatures began to
be as insolent and troublesome as before; but however,
an Accident happening presently upon this, which endan-
gered the Safety of them all, they were obliged to lay bjr
all private Resentments, and look to the Preservation of
their Lives.
I t happened one Night, that the Spaniard Governor,1
as I call him, that is to fay, the Spaniard whose Life I had
lav'd, who was now the Captain, or Leader, or Gover-
nor of the rest, found himself very uneasy in the Night,'-
and could by no Means get any Sleep: He was perfectly.
well in Body, as he told me the Story, only found his
Thoughts tumultuous; his Mind ran upon. Men fighting;
and killing one another, but was broad awake, and could
not by any Means get any Sleep; in short, he lay a great .
while, but growing more and more uneasy, he resolved to
rise: As they lay (being ft many of them) upon Goat-
skins, laid thick upon such Couches, and Pads, as they
made for themselves, and not in Hammocks and Ship-
beds, as I did, who was but one; so they had little to do,
when they were willing to rise, but to get up upon their
Feet, and perhaps put on a Coat, such as it was, and their
Pumps, and they were ready for going any Way that their
Thoughts guided them.
Being thus gotten up, he look'd out; bot being dark,
he could see little or nothing; ani besides the Trees which
I had planted, as in my former Account is described, and
which were now grown tall, intercepted his Sight, so that
he could only look up, and see that it was a clear Star-
light Night, and hearing no Noise, he return'd and laid
him down again; but it was all one, he could not sleep,
nor could he compose himself to any thing like Rest, but
his Thoughts were to the last Degree uneasy, and yet he
knew not for what.
Having made some Noise with rising and walking
about, going out and coming in, another of them wak'd,
and calling, ask'd, Who it was that was up? the Gover-
nor told him, how it had been with him: Say you so,
says the other Spaniard; such Things are not to be slighted,
I afore you; there is certainly some Mischief working,
says he, near us; and presently he ask'd him, Where are
the Englishmen? They are all in their Huts, says he, safe
enough. It seems, the Spaniards had kept Possession of the
main Apartment, and had made a Place, Where the three
IBnglishmen, since their last Mutiny, always quarter'd by
themselves, and could not come at the rest. Well, says
the Spaniard, there is something in it, I am persuaded
from my own Experience; I am satisfied our Spirits embo-
died have a Converse with, and receive Intelligence from,
the Spirits unembodied, and inhabiting the invisible World;
and this friendly Notice is given for our Advantage, if we
know how to make use of it. Come, says he, let us go out
and look abroad, and if we find nothing at all in it to justify
the Trouble, I'll tell you a "Story to the Purpose, that shall
convince you of the Justice of my proposing it.
I n a Word, they went out to go to the Top of the
Hill, where I us'd to go; but they being strong and in.
goad Company, not alone, as I was, us'd none of my
Cautions, to go up by the Ladder, and then pulling it up
after them, to go up a second Stage to the Top, but were
going round through the Grove uncoaccra'd and unwary,
when
5
v/hm they were siirpriz'd with seeing a Light, as of Fire
a very little Way off from them, and hearing the Voices of
Men, not of one, or two, but of a great Number.
I n all the Discoveries I had made of the Savages landing
on the Island, it was my constant Care to prevent them
making the least Discovery of there being any Inhabitant
upon the Place; and when by any Necessity they came to
know it, they felt it so effectually, that they that got
away, were scarce able to give any Account of it; for we
disappears as soon as possible, nor did ever any that had
seen me, escape to tell any one else, except it was the three
Savages in our last Encounter, who jump'd into the Boat,
of whom I mention'd, that I was afraid they should go
Home, and bring more Help.
Whether it was the Consequence of the Escape of
those Men, that so great a Number came now together;
or whether they came ignorantly and by Accident on their
usual bloody Errand, the Spaniards could not it seems un-
derstand; but whatever it was, it had been their Business,
either to have conceal'd themselves, and not to have seen
them at all; much less to have let the Savages have seen
that there were any Inhabitants in the Place: But to have
sallen upon them so effectually, as that not a Man of them
should have escapid, which could only have been by get-
ting in between them and their Boats; but this Presence of
Mind was wanting to them, which was the RuiB of their
Tranquillity for a great while.
W e need not doubt, but that the Governor and the
Man with him, surpriz.'d with this Sight, ran back im-
mediately, and rais'd their Fellows, giving them an Ac-
count ot the imminent Danger they were all in; and they
again as readily took the Alarm, but it was impossible to
persuade them to stay close within where they were, but
that they must run all out to see how Things stood.
While it was dark indeed, they were well enough,
and they had Opportunity enough for some Hours to view
them by the Light of three Fires they had made at seme
Distance from one another; what they were doing, they
knew not, and what to do themselves, they knew not;
for, first, the Enemy were too many; and secondly, they
did not keep together, but were divided into several Par-
ties, and were on Shore in several Places.
T Hi Spaniards were in no .srnall Consternation at this
Sight i and as they found that the Fellows ran straggling
all over the Shore,- they made no Doubt, but, first or last,
some of them would chop in upon their Habitation, or
upon some other Place, where they wOiUd see the Tokens
or" Inhabitants; and they were in great Perplexity also for
fear of their Flock of Goats, which would have been lit-
tle less than starving them, if they should have been de-
stroys; so the first Thing they resolv'd upon, was to dis-
patch three Men away, before it was light, viz.. two Spa-
niards and one Englishman, to drive all the Goats away to
the great Vally where the Cave was, and if Need were,
to drive them into the very Cave itself.
Could they have seen the Savages all together in one
Body, and at any Distance from their Canoes, they resolv'd,
if they had been an hundred of them, to have attack'd
them; but that could not be obtained, for they were some
of them two Miles off from the other, and, as it appear'd
afterwards, were of two different Nations.
After having mused a great while on the Course
they should take, and beaten their Brains in considering
their present Circumstances; they resolv'd at last, while it'
was dark, to send the old Savage, (Friday's Father) out, as
a Spy, to learn, if possible, something concerning them, as
what they came for, and what they intended to do, and
the like; the old Man readily undertook it, and stripping
himself quite naked, as most of the Savages were, away
he went: After he had been gone an Hour or two, he
brings Word, that he had been among them undiscover'd,
that he found they were two Parties, and of two several
Nations who had War with one another, and had had
a great Battle in their own Country, and that both Sides
having had several Prisoners taken in the Fight, they were
by mere Chance landed all in the fame Island, for the de-
vouring their Prisoners, and making merry; but their
coming so by Chance to the fame Place had spoil'd all their
Mirth; that they were in a great Rage at one another, and
were so near, that he believ'd they would fight again,
as soon as Day-light began to" appear; but he did not per-
ceive that they had any Notion of any body's being on the
Ifland but themselves. He had hardly made an End of tel-
ling his Story, when they could perceive, by the unusual
Noise they made, that the two little Armies wereengag'd
in a bloody Fight.
rRIDAT's Father -used all the Arguments he could to
persuade ow People to Uc close, and not to be seen; he told
them,
them their Safety consisted in it, and that they had nothing
to do but to lie still, and the Savages would kill one ano-
ther to their Hands, and the rest would go away; and it
was so to a Tittle. But it was impossible to prevail, espe-
cially upon the Englishmen; their Curiosity was so impor-
tunate upon their Prudentials, that they must run out
and fee the Battle: However, they used some Caution,
{ viz .) they did not go openly, just by their own Dwelling,
but went sarther into the Woods, and plac'd themselves to
Advantage, where they might securely see them manage
the Fight, and, as they thought, not be seen by them;
but, it seems, the Savages did see them, as we shall find
hereafter.
The Battle was very fierce, and if I might believe the
Englishmen, one of them said, he could perceive, that some
of them were Men of great Bravery, of invincible Spirits,
and of great Policy in guiding the Fight. The Battle,
they said, held two Hours, before they could guess which
Party would be beaten; but then that Party which was
nearest our People's Habitation, began to appear weakest,
and after some Time more, some of them began to fly;
and this put our Men again into a great Consternation, lest
any of those that fled should run into the Grove, before
their Dwelling, for Shelter, and thereby involuntarily dis-
cover the Place; and that by Consequence the Pursuers
should do the like in Search for them. Upon this they re-
fblv'd that they would stand arm'd within the Wall, and
whoever came into the Grove, they should sally out over
the Wall, and kill them; so that, if possible, not one should
return to give an Account of it; they order'd also, that it
should be done with their Swords, or by knocking them
down with the Stock of the Musquet, not by shooting
them, for fear of raising an Alarm by the Noise,
As they expected, it fell out; three of the routed Army
fled for Life, and, crossing the Creek, ran directly into
the Place, not in the least knowing whether they went,
but running as into a thi.k Wood for Shelter; the Scout
they kept to look abroad, gave Notice of this within,
with this Addition, to our Mens great Satissaction, (viz.)
That the Conquerors had not pursued them, or seen which
way they were gone; upon this, the S/xJwW^-Governor,
a Man of Humanity, would not suffer them to Kill the
three Fugitives; but sending three Men cut by the Top of
the HtU, order'd them to go round, and come in behind
C them,
them, surprize and take them Prisoners, which was done;
the Residue of the conquer'd People fled to their Canoes,
and got off to Sea; the Victors retir'd, and made no Pur-
suit, or very little; but drawing themselves into a Body
together, gave two great screaming Shouts, which they
suppos'd were by way of Triumph, and so the Fight end-
ed: And the fame Day, about three o'Clock in the Af-
ternoon, they also marched to their Canoes. And thus the
Spaniards had their Island again free to themselves, their
Fright was over, and they faw no Savages in several Years
after.
After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of
their Den; and viewing the Field of Battle, they found
about two and thirty dead Men upon the Spot; some
were kill'd with great long Arrows, some of which were
found sticking in their Bodies; but most of them were
kill'd with their great wooden Swords, sixteen or seven-
teen of which they found in the Field of Battle, and as
many Bows, with a great many Arrows: These Swords
were strange great unwieldy Things, and they must be
Tery strong Men that used them: Most of those Men that
were kill'd with them, had their Heads mash'd to pieces,
as we may fay, or, as we call it in English, their Brains
knock'd out, and several their Arms and Legs broken;
so that 'tis evident they fight with inexpressible Rage and
Fury: They found not one wounded Man that was not
ftoHe-dead; for either they stay by their Enemy till they
have quite kill'd him, or they carry all the wounded Men,
that are not quite dead, away with them.
This Deliverance tam'd our Englishmen for a great
while; the Sight had fill'd them with Horror, and the
Consequences appear'd terrible to the last Degree, esoeci-
ally upon sopposing that some time or other they should
sell into the Hands of those Creatures, who would not on-
ly kill them as Enemies, but kill them for Food, as we
kill our Cattle. And they profess'd to me, that the
Thoughts of being eaten up like Beef or Mutton, though
it was soppos'd it was not to be till they were dead, had
something in it so horrible, that it nauseated their very
Stomachs, made them sick when they thought of it, and
fill'd their Minds with such unusual Terror, that they were
not themselves for some Weeks after.
This, as I faid, tam'd even the three .English Brutes I
have been speaking of; and for a great while after, they
, were
Were very tractable, and went about the common Busi-
ness of the whole Society well enough; planted, ibw'd,
reap'd, and began to be all naturalized to the Country;
but some time after this, they fell all into such simple
Measures again as brought them into a great deal ot
Trouble.
They had taken three Prisoners, as I had observ'd, and
these three being lusty stout young Fellows, they made
them Servants, and taught them to work for them ,. and,
as Slaves, they did well enough; but they did not take
their Measures with them, as I did by my Man Friday,
via. to begin with them upon the Principle of having fa-
ved their Lives, and then instruct them in the rational
Principles of Life, much less of Religion, civilizing and
reducing them by kind Ufage, and affectionate Arguings;
but as they gave them their Food every Day, so they gave
them their Work too, and kept them fully employ'd ia
Drudgery enough; but they fail'd in this, by it, that they
never had them to assist them and fight for them, as I had
my Man Friday, who was as true to me as the very Flesh
upon my Bones.
But to come to the Family Part,- being all now good
Friends, (for common Danger, as I faid above, had effectu-
ally reconcile them) they began to consider their general
Circumstances; and the first Thing that came under their
Consideration was, Whether, seeing the Savages particularly
haunted that Side of the Island, and that there were more
remote and retir'd Parts of it equally adapted to their way
of Living, and manifestly to their Advantage, they should
not rather temove their Habitation, and plant in some
more proper Place for their Safety, and especially for the
Security of their Cattle and Corn?
Upon this, after long Debate, it was concluded, That
they would not remove their Habitation; because that some
time or other, they thought they might hear from their
Governor again, meaning me; and if I should send any
one to seek them, I would be sure to direct them to that
Side, where, if they should find the Place demolish'd, they
would conclude the Savages had kill'd us all, and we were
gone, and so our Supply would go away too. .,
But as to their Corn and Cattle, they agreed to remove
them into the Vally where my Cave was, where the
Land was as proper to both, and where indeed there was
Land enough: However, upon second Thoughts, they
C a alter'd
I ]
alter'd one Part of that Resolution too, and resolv'd only
to remove Part of their Cattle thither, and plant Part of
their Corn there ; and so, if one Part was destroy'd the
other might be faved: And one Part of Prudence they
used, which it was very well they did, viz.. That they
never trusted these three Savages, which they had taken
Prisoners, with knowing any thing of the Plantation
they had made in that Vally, or of any Cattle they had
there; much less of the Cave there, which they kept in
ease of Necessity, as a fafe Retreat, and thither they car-
ried also the two Barrels of Powder, which I had sent
them at my coming away.
But however they resolv'd not to change their Habita-
tion, yet they agreed, that as I had carefully cover'd it first
with a Wall or Fortification, and then with a Grove of
Trees; so, feeing their Safety conlisted intirely in their be-
ing conceal'd, of which they were now fully convinc'd;
they set to work to cover and conceal the Place yet more
effectually than before: To this Purpose, as I had planted
Trees (or rather thrust in Stakes, which in time all grew
up to be Trees) for some good Distance before the En-
trance into my Apartment, they went on in the fame Man-
ner, and fili'd up the rest of that whole Space of Ground,
from the Trees I had set, quite down to the Side of the
Creek, where, as I faid, I landed my Floats, and even in-
to the very Ouze where the Tide flow'd, not so much as
leaving any Place to land, or any Sign that there had been
any Landing thereabout: These Stakes also, being of a Wood
very forward to grow, as I have noted formerly, they took
rare to have generally very much larger and taller than
those which I had planted, and placed them so very thick
and close, that when they had been three or four Years
grown, there was no piercing with the Eye any consider-
able way into the Plantation: As for that Part which
I had planted, the Trees were grown as thick at a Man's
Thigh; and among them they placed so many other short
ones, and so thick, that, in a Word, it stood like a Pali-
ftdo, a quarter .of a Miie thick, and it was next-to impos-"
sible to penetrate it, but with a little Army to cut it all
down; for a little Dog could hardly get between the Trees,
they stood so close.
But this was not at all; for they did the lame by all the
Ground t» the right Hand, and to the left, and round even
to the Tog of the Hill; leaving no Way, not so much
C ss I
*s for themselves to come out, but by the Ladder placed
up to the Side of the Hill, and then lifted up, and placed
again from the first Stage up to the Top; which Ladder
when it was taken down, nothing but what had Wings
or Witchcraft to assist it, could come at them.
This was excellently well contriv'd: Nor was it less
than what they afterwards found Occasion for; which-
serv'd to convince me, that as human Prudence has Au-
thority of Providence to justify it, si> it has, doubtless, the
Direction of Providence to set it to Work*; and would we
listen carefully to the Voice of it, I am fully persuaded wer
might prevent many of the Disasters which our Lives are
now by our own Negligence subjected to. But this by-
the way.
I return to the Story; They liv'd two Years after this
in perfect Retirement, and had no more Visits from the
Savages: They had, indeed, an Alarm given them one
Morning, which put them into a great Consternation; for-
some of the Spaniards being out early one Morning on the
WestSide, or rather End of the Island, which, by the way;
was that End where I never went, for fear of being dis--
cover'd, they were surprised with seeing above twenty?
Canoes of Indians, just coming on Shore.
;The y made the best of their way home, irr- hurry
enough; and giving the Alarm to their Comrades, they
kept close all that Day and the next, going out only at
Night, to make Observation: But they had the good Luck
to be mistaken; for where-ever the Savages went, they-
did not land at that Time on the Island, but pursued some
other Design, . - -
Anb- now they had another Broil with the three Eng-
lishmen; one of which, a most turbulent Fellow, being in
a Rage at one of the three Slaves, which I mentioned they
had taken, because the Fellow had not done something
right which he bid him do, and seem'd a little untractable
in his shewing him, drew a Hatchet out of a Frog-Belt,
in which he wore it by his Side, and fell upon the poor
Savage, not to correct him, but to kill him. One;of the
Spaniards, who was by, seeing him give the Fellow^ a bar-
barous Cut with the Hatchet, which he aim'd at his Head,
but struck into his Shoulder, so that he thought he had cut
the poor Creature's Arm off, ran to him, and intreating him
not to murder the poor Man, clapt in between him and
the Savage, to prevent the Misehief.
The Fellow being enraged the more at this, struck at
the Spaniard with his Hatchet, and swore he would serve
him aS he intended to serve the Savage; which the Spa-
niard perceiving, avoided the Blow, and with a Shovel
which he had in his Hand, (for they were working in
the Field about their Corn-Land) knock'd the Brute down:
Another of the Englishmen running at the same Time to
help his Comrade, kneck'd the Spaniard down; and then
two Spaniards more came to help their Man, and a third
Englishman fell upon them. They had none of them any
Fire-Arms, or any other Weapons but Hatchets and other
Tools, except this third Englishman; he had one of my
old rusty Cutlaces, with which he made at the last Spa-
niards, and wounded them both: This Fray set the whols-
Family in an Uproar, and more Help coming in, they
took the three Englishmen Prisoners. The next Question
was, What should be done with them? They had been so
often mutinous, and were so furious, so desperate, and so
idle withal, that they knew not what Course to take with
them; for they were mischievous to the highest Degree,
and valued not what Hurt they did any Man; so that in
short, it was not safe to live with them.
The Spaniard, who was Governor, told them in so
many Words, That if they hadbttn his own Countrymen, he
would have hang'd them all; for all Lavs and all Gover-
nors were to preserve Society; and those who were dangerous
to the Society, ought to be expeil'd out of it; but, as they
were Englishmen, and that it was to the generous Kindness
of an Englishman that they all ow'd their Preservation and
Deliverance, he would use them with all possible Lenity, and
would leave them to the Judgment of the other two English-
men, who were their Countrymen.
One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said,
They desir'd it might not be left to them; For, says he, I
am sure, we ought to sentence them to the Gallows ; and with
that gives an Account, how William Atkins, one of the
three, had propos'd to have all the five Englishmen join
together, and murder all the Spaniards, when they were
in their Sleep.
When the Spanish Governor heard this, he calls to
Will. Atkins: How, Seignior Atkins, says he, will you mur-
der us all? What have you to say to that? That harden'd
Villain was so sar from denying it, that he said, it was
true, and G—d d—-inn him thev would do it still before
they
they had done with them. Well, but, Seignior Atkins,
said the Spaniard, what have we done to you, that you will
kill us? And what would you get ly killing us? and what
must we do to prevent your killing us? Must we kill you. or
will you kill us? Why will you put us to the Necessity of this,
Seignior Atkins? fays the Spaniard very calmly, and
smiling.
Seignior Atkins was in such a Rage at the Spaniard's
making a Jest of it, that,' had he not been held by three
Men, and withal had no Weapons with him, it was
thought he would have attempted to have kill'd the Spa-
niard in the Middle of all the Company.
This hair-brain'd Carriage obliged them to consider
seriously what was to be done. The two Englifimen and
the Spaniard, who sav'd the poor Savage, was of the
Opinion, That they should hang one of the three for an
Example to the rest, and that particularly, it should be he
that had twice attempted to commit Murder with his Hatchet;
and indeed there was some Reason to believe he had done
it, for the poor Savage was in such a miserable Condition
with the Wound he nad receiv'd, that it was thought, he
could not live.
But the Governor-Spaniard still said: No, It was an
Englishman that had sav'd all their Lives, and he would
never consent to put an Englishman to Death, tho' he had
murler'd half of them; nay, he said, if he had been kill'd
himself by an Englishman, and had Time left to speak, it
should be, that they should pardon him.
This was so positively insisted on by the Governor-
Spaniard, that there was no gainsaying it: And as merciful
Councils are most apt to prevail, where they are so earnestly
press'd, so they all came into it; but then it was to be
consider'd, what should be done to keep them from doing
the Mischief they design'd; for all agreed, Governor and
all, That Means were to be used for preserving the Society
from Danger: After a long Debate, it was agreed, first,
That they should bt difarm'd, and not permitted to have
either Gun, or Powder, or Shot, or Sword, or any Weapon,
and should be turn'd out of the Society, and left to live where
they would, and how they would, by themselves; but that
none of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should converse
with them, speak with them, or have any thing to do with
them; that they should be forbid to come within a certain
Distanct of the Place where the rest dwelt; and that, if they
C4

ejser'd to commit any Disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or de-
stroy any of the Corn, Plantings, Buildings, Fences, or Cattle
belonging to the Society, that they should die without Mercy,
and they should shoot them where-ever they could find them.
The Governor, a Man of great Humanity, muiing
upon the Sentence, consider'd a little upon it, and turning
to the two honest Englishmen, said, Hold; you must. rtfieU,
that it will be long ere they can raise Corn and Cattle of
their own, and they must not starve; we must therefore
allow them Provisions: So he caus'd to be added, That they-
should have a. I'roportion of Corn given them to last them
ti^ht Months, and for Seed to sow, by which Time they
might be suppos'd to raise some of their own; that they
should have six Milch-Goat s, four He-Goats, and fix Kids
given them, as well for present Subsistence, as for a Store;
and that they. stnuld have Tools given them for their Work
in the Fields; such as fix Hatchets, an Ax, a Saw, and the
like: But they (l>ould have none of these Tools. or Provi-
sions, unless they would swear solemnly, That they would
not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with them, or of
their Fellow Englishmen.
Thus they dii'mis'd them the Society, and turn'd 'era.
out to shist for themselves. They went away lullen, and
refractory, as neither contented ta go away, or to stay;
but, as there was no Remedy, they went, pretending to
go and chuse a Place where they would settle themselves,
to plant, and live by themselves; and some Provisions were
given them, but no Weapons.
About four or five Days after, they came again for
some Victuals, and gave the Governor an Account where
they had pitch'd their Tents, and mark'd themselves out
an Habitation and Plantation; and it was a very convenient
Place indeed, on the remotest Part of the Island, N. E. much.
about the Place where I providentially landed in my first
Voyage, when I was driven out to Sea, the Lord alone
knows whither, in my foolish Attempt to surround the
island.
Here they built themselves two handsome Huts, and-
contriv'd them in a Manner like my first Habitation, be-
ing close under the Side of an Hill, having some Trees
growing already on the three Sides of it, so that by plant-
ing others, it would be very easily cover'd from the Sight,
unless narrowly scarch'd for; they desir'd some dry.'d Goat-
Skins for Beds and Covering, which were given them;.
and,
andVupon giving their Words, that they would not disturb
the rest, or injure any of their Plantations, they gave 'em
Hatchets, and what other Tools they could spare; some
Peas, Barley, and Rice, for sowing, and in a Word, any
thing they wanted, but Arms and Ammunition.
They liv'd in this separate Condition about six Months,
and had gotten in their first Harvest, tho' the Quantity was
but small, the Parcel of Land they had planted being but
little; for indeed, having all their Plantation to form, they
had a great deal of Work upon their Hands; and when
they came to make Boards, and Pots, and such Things,
they were quite out of their Element, and could make
nothing of it; and when the rainy Season came on, for
want of a Cave in the Earth; they could not keep their
Grain dry, and it was in great Danger of spoiling: And
this humbled them much; so they came and begg5d'the/
Spaniards to help them, which they very readily did ;. and'
in four Days work'd a great Hole in the Side of the Hili
for them, big enough to secure their Corn, and other-
Things from the Rain; but it was but a poor Place, at
best, compar'd to-mine; -and-.especially as mine was then,'
for the Spaniards-hid greatly enlarg'd it* and made several
new Apartments in it.
About three Quarters of a Year after this Separation, a>
new Frolick took these Rogues, which, together with the
former Villainy they had committed, brought Mischief
enough upon them, and had very near been the Ruin of
the whole Colony. The three new Sedates began, it seems
TO be weary of the laborious Life they led, and that with-
out Hope of bettering their Circumstances; and a Whitrr
took them, that they would make a Voyage to the Con*
tinenr, from whence the Savages came, and would try if
they could not seize upon some Prisoners among the Na-
tives there, and bring them home, so to make them da
the laborious Part of their Work for them.
The Project was not so preposterous, if they had cons
no-farther; but they did nothing, and propos'd nothing-*
but had either Mischief in the Design, or-Mischief in the
Event: And, if I may give my Opinion, they -seem'A to
be under a Blast from Heaven; for if we will not .allow
a visible Curse to pursue visible Crimes, how shall we re-
concile the Events of Things with the Divine Justice? It
was certainly an apparent Vengeance on their Crime of
Mutiny and Piracy, that brought 'em to the State they were
C; in;
in; and as they shew'd not the least Remorse for the
Grime, but added new Villainies to it, luch as, particularly,
that Piece of monstrous Cruelty of wounding a poor Slave,
because he did not, or perhaps could not understand to
do what he was directed; and to wound him in such a
Manner, as, no question, made him a Cripple all his Life;
and in a Place where no Surgeon or Medicine could be
had for his Cure; and what was still worse, the murderous
Intent, or, to do Justice to the Crime, the intentional
Murder, for such to be sure it was, as was afterwards the
form'd Design they all laid, to murder the Spaniards in
cold Blood, and in their Sleep.
But I leave observing, and return to the Story: The
three Fellows came down to the Spaniards one Morning,
and in very humble Terms, desir'd to be admitted to speak
with them: The Spaniards very readily heard what they
had to fay, which was this, That they were tir'd of living
in the Manner they did; that they were not handy enough
to make the Necessaries they wanted; and that, having no
Help, they found they should be starv'd: But if the Spa-
niards would give them Leave to take one of the Canoes
which they came over in, and give them Arms and Am-
munition, proportion'd for their Defence, they would go.
over to the Main, and seek their Fortune, and so deliver
them from the Trouble of supplying them with any other
Provisions.
The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them,-
but yet very honestly represented to them the certain De-
struction they were running into; told them, they had fus>
fer'd such Hardships upon that very Spot, that they could,
without any Spirit of Prophecy, tell them, that they would
be starv'd, or murder'd, and bad them consider of it.
The Men reply'd audacioufly, they should be starv'd
if they st.iy'd here, for they could not work, and would
not work i and they could but be starv'd abroad; and if
they were murder-d, there was an End of them, they-
had no Wives or Children. to cry after them; and in short,
insisted importunately upon their Demand, declaring, that
they would go, whether they would give them any Arms
or no.
The Spaniards told them, with great Kindness, That if
they were resolv'd to go, they should not go like naked.
Men, and be in no Condition to defend themselves; and.
that, tho' they could ill spare their Eire-Arms, having not
enough.
enough for themselves, yet they would let them have twa
Mulquets, a Pistol, and a Cutlace, and each Man a Hatchet,
which they thought was sufficient for them.
I n a Word, they accepted the Offer; and having bak'd
rhem Bread enough to serve them a Month, and given them
as much Goats-Flesh, as they could eat while it was sweet,
and a great Basket full of dry'd Grapes, a Pot full of fresh
Water, and a young Kid alive to kill, they boldly set out
in a Canoe for a Voyage over the Sea, where it was at
least 40 Miles broad.
The Boat was indeed a large one, and would have
very well carry'd fifteen or twenty Men; and therefore,
was rather too big for them to manage: But as they had
a sair Breeze, and the Flood-Tide with them, they did
well enough: They had made a Mast of a long Pole, and
a Sail of four large Goat-Skins dry'd, which they had
sew'd-or lac'd together; and away they went merrily
enough; the Spaniards called after them, BonVeajoi and no
Man ever thought of seeing them any more.
The Spaniards would often say one to another, and
the two honest Englishmen who remain'd behind, how
quietly and comfortably they liv'd now those three turbu-
lent Fellows were gone; as for their ever coming again,
that was the remotest Thing from their Thoughts that
could be imagin'd; when behold, after 11 Days Absence,
one of the Englishmen being abroad upon his Planting-
work, fees three strange Men coming towards him at a
Distance, two of them with Guns upon their Shoulders.
Away runs the Englishman, as if he was bewitch'd,
and came frighted and amaz'd to the Governor-Spaniard,
and tells him they were all undone, for there were Stran-
gers landed upon the Island, he could not tell who: The
Spaniard pausing a-while, says to him, How do you mean,
you cannot tell who f They are the Savages to be sure. No,
no, says the Englishman, they are Men in Cloaths with
Arms: Nay then, says the Spaniard, why are you concern'dt
Jf they are not Savages, they must be Friends; for there is
no Christian Nation upon Earth but will do us Good rather
than Harm.
While they were debating thus, come the three
Englishmen; and standing without the Wood, which was
new-planted, halloo'd to them; they presently knew their
Voices, and so all the Wonder of that kind ceas'd. But now
the Admiration was turn'd upon another Question, viz-
C 6 What
What could be the Matter, and what made them come
back again? ,
I t was not long before they brought the Men in, and
inquiring where they had been, and what they had been
.doing? they gave them a full Account of their Voyage,
in a few Words, viu That they reach'd the Land in two
Days, or something less, but finding the People alarm'd
at their coming, and preparing with Bows and Arrows to.
fight them, they durst not go on Shore, but sail'd- on to
the Northward six or seven Hours, till they came to.a great
Opening, by which they percciv.'d, that the Land they
saw from our Island was not the Main, but an Island; that
entering that Opening of the Sea, they saw another Island
on the Right-hand, North, and several more West; and
being resolv'd to land somewhere* they put over to one
of the Islands which lay West, and went boldly on Shore;
that they found the People were courteous and friendly to
them, and they. gave them several Roots, and some dry'd
Fish, and appear'd very sociable i and the Women, as well
as the Men, were very forward to supply them with any
thing they could get for them to eat, and brought it to
them a great way upon their Heads.
They continu'd Here four Days, and inquir'd as well as
they could of them by Signs, what Nations were this
way, and that way; and were told of several fierce and
terrible People, that liv'd almost every ways who, as they
made known by Signs to them, us'd to eat Men; but as
for themselves, they said.that they.never eat Men or WoT
men, except only such^as they took.in. the Wars 4. and then
they own'd, that. they made a great Feast, and eat their
Prisoners.
The Engliflimen inquir'd, when . they. had a Feast of
that Kind, and they told them, two Moons ago, pointing
to the Moon, and then . to two Fingers; and that their-
great King had loo Prisoners now, which he had taken
in his War; and they were feeding them to make them
fat for the next Feast. The Englishmen scem'd mighty
desirous to fee those Prisoners, but the others mistaking
them, thought they were desirous to have some of them,
to carry away for their own eating. So they beckon'd
to them, pointing to the Setting of the Sun, and then
to the Rising, which was to signify, that the next Morn-
ing, at Sun-rising, they would bring some for them;
and accordingly, the n«xt Morning, they. brought down
five Women and eleven Men, and gave them to the-
Englishmen, to carry with them on their Voyage, just as
we would bring so many Cows and Oxen down to-a
Sea-Port Town, to victual a Ship.
A s brutish and barbarous as these Fellows were at home;
their Stomachs turn'd at this Sight, and they did not know
what to do* to-refuse the Prisoners, would have been the
highest Affront to the Savage-Gentry that offer'd them;
and what to do with them, they knew not; however, up-
on some Debates, they. resolv'd. to. accept of them, and
in Return, they. gave the Savages that brought them, one
of their Hatchets, an old Key, a Knife, and six,or seven
of their Bullets, which, tho' they did not understand, they
seem'd extremely pleas'*! with: And then, tying the poor
Creatures Hands behind them, they (the Peoples dragg'd
the Prisoners into the Boat far our Men.
The Englishmen were obliged to come away-as-soon
as they had them, or else they that gave them this noble
Present, would certainly have expected that they should
have gone to work- with them, have kill'd two or three
of them the next Morning, and perhaps, have invited the
Donors to Dinner.
But. having taken their Leave with all the Respects
and Thanks-that could well pass between People, where
on either Side they understood not one Word they could
say, they put off with their Boat, and came back towards
the first Island, where, when they arriv'd, they set eight
of their. Prisoners at Liberty, there being too many of
them for their Occasion.
I n their Voyage, they endeavour'd to have some Com*
munication with their Prisoners, but it was impossible to
make them understand any thing; nothing they could
say to them, or give them, or do for them, but was look'd
upon as going about. to murder them: They first of. all
unbound them, but the poor Creatures soream'd at that,
especially the Women, as if th»y had just felt the Knife
at their Throats; for they immediately concluded, they
were unbound on Purpose to be kill'd.
If they gave them any Thing to eat, it, was-the same
Thing; then they concluded, it was for fear they should
sink in Flesh, and so not be sat enough to kill: If they
look'd at one of them more particularly, the Party pre-
sently concluded, it was to fee whether he or she was saf-
est, and fittest to.kill first; nay, after they had brought them
quite*
t 6*3
quite over, ar.d began to use them kindly, and treat them
well, still they expected every Day to make a Dinner or
Supper for their new Masters.
When the three Wanderers had given this unaccoun-
table History, or Journal of their Voyage, the Spaniard
ask'd them, Where their new Family was? And being
told that they had brought them on Shore, and put them
into one of their Huts, and were come to beg some Victuals
for them; they (the Spaniards) and the other two English-
men, that is to say, the whole Colony, resolv'd to go all
down to the Place, and fee them, and did so, and Fridays
Father with them.
When they came into the Hut, there they sat all
bound; for when they had brought them on Shore, they
bound their Hands, that they might not take the Boat,
and make their Escape; there, I say, they fat, all of them
stark-naked: First, There were three Men, lusty comely
Fellows well-shap'd, strait and sair Limbs, about 3o to
thirty-five Years of Age; and five Women, whereof two
might be from thirty to forty, two more not above four
or five and twenty, and the fifth, a tall comely Maiden,
about sixteen or seventeen: The Women were well-fk-
vour'd agreeable Persons, both in Shape and Features, only
tauny, and two of them, had they been perfect white*
would have pass'd for very handsome Women, even in
Ltrulen itself; having very pleasant agreeable Countenances,
and of a very modest Behaviour, especially when they came
afterwards to be cloath'd, and dress'd, as they call'd it,
tho' that Dress was very indifferent, it must be confess'd %.
of which hereafter.
The Sig^ht you may be sore was something uncouth?
to our Spaniards, who were (to give them a just Character)
Men of the best Behaviour, of the most calm sedate Tem-
pers, and perfect Good-humour that ever I met with;
and in particular, of the most Modesty, as will presently
appear: I say, the Sight was very uncouth, to fee two
naked Men, and five naked Women, all together bound,
and in the most miserable Circumstances that human Na-
ture could be suppos'd to be, viz., to be expecting every
Moment to be dragg'd out, and have their Brains knock'd
out, and then to be eaten up, like a Calf that is kill'd for
a Dainty.
The first Thing they did, was to cause the old Indian.
Friday's Father, to go in and. fee first if he knew any of
thenu.
5
them; and then, if he understood any ef their Speech:
As soon as the old Man came in, he look'd seriously at
them, but knew none of them; neither could any of them
understand a Word he said, or a Sign he could make, ex-
cept one of the Women.
However, this was enough to answer the End, which
was to satisfy them, that the Men into whose Hands they
were sallen were Christians; that they abhorr'd eating of
Men or Women, and that they might be lure they would
sot be kili'd i As soon as they were aflur'd of this, they
discover'd such a Joy, and by such aukward, and several
Ways as is bard to describe; for it seems they were of
several Nations.
The Woman, who was their Interpreter, was bid in
the next Place, to ask them if they were willing to be
Servants, and to work for the Men who had brought them
away, to save their Lives? At which they all fell a dancing;
and presently one fell to taking up this, and another that,
any thing that lay next, to carry on their Shoulders, to
intimate, that they were willing to work.
The Governor, who found, that the having Women
among them, would presently be attended with Ibme In-
convenlency, aud might occasion some Strife, and perhaps
Blood;. ask'd the three Men, what they intended to do
with these Women, and how they intended to use them;
whether as Servants, or as Women f One of the English-
men answer'd very boldly and readily, that they would
use them as both. To which the Governor said, I am
not going to restrain you from it, you are your own Masters
as to that: But this I think is but just, for avoiding Disor-
ders and Quarrels among you; and I desire it of you, for
that Reason only, viz. That you will all engage, that if any
of you take any of these Women, as a Woman, or Wife,
be shall take but one; and that having taken one, none else
should touch her; for though toe cannot marry any of you, yet
'tis tut reasonable, that while you stay here, the Woman any
of you takes, should be maintam'd by the Man that takes her,
and should be his Wife; I mean, says he, while he continues
here, and that none else should have any thing to do with her.
All this appear'd so just, that every one agreed to it without
any Difficulty.
Then the Englishmen ask'd the Spaniards, If they de-
sign'd to take any of them? But every one answer'd,
N O.;. Some of them laid, they had Wives ia Spam,
and
E *4 I
and the others did not like Women that were not Chri-
stians; and all together declared, that they would not touch-
one of them; which was an Instance of such Virtue, as)
I.have not met with in all my Travels: On the other.
Hand, to be short, the five Englishmen took. them every.
one a Wife, that is to fay, a temporary Wife ; and so-they
set up a new Form of Living;- for the Spaniards and Friday's-
Father liv'd in my. old Habitation, which they had enlarg'A
exceedingly within; the three Servants which they had taken
in the late Battle of the Savages, liv'd with them; and these
carried on the main Part of the Colony, supplying. all the
rest with Food, and assisting. them in any.thing as they
could, or as they found Necessity requir'd.
But the Wonder of this Story was, how five such re-
fractory ill-match'd. Fellows should agree about these Wo-
men, and that two of them should not pitch upon the
fame Woman, especially seeing two or three of them were,
without Comparison, more agreeable than the other: But
they took agpod Way enough to prevent quarrelling among
themselves; for they set the five Women by themselves in.
one of their Hut*, and they went all into the other Hut,
and drew Lots among them, who should chuse first.
H e that drew to chuse first, went away by himself to-
the Hut where the poor naked Creatures were, and fetch'd
out her he chose; and it was worth observing, that he
that chose first took her that was reckon'd the homeliest*
and the oldest of the five, which made Mirth enough
among the rest; and even the Spaniards laugh'd at it: Buc

When the poor-Women saw themselves set in a Row
thus, and fetch'd out one by one, the Terrors of their Con-
dition return'd upon them again, and they firmly believed
that they were now going to be devoured: Accordingly,
when the Englist) Sailor came in and fetch'd but one o£
them, the rest set up a most lamentable Cry, and hung
about her, and took their Leave of her with fiich Agonies,
and such Affection, as would have griev'd the hardest Heart
in the World; nor was it possible for the Englisstimen to sa-
tisfy them, that they were not to be immediately mur-
der'd, till they fetch'd the old Man, Friday's Father, who
immediately let them know, that the .five .Men,-who hid
fetch'd.
setch'd them out one by one, had chosen them for their
Wives.
When they had done this, and the Fright of the Women
were in, was a little over, the Men went to work, and the
Spaniards came and help'd them; and in a few Hours they
had built them every one a new Hut or Tent for their Lodg-
ing apart; for those they had already, were crouded with
their Tools, Houfhold-StufF, and Provisions : The three-
wicked Ones had pitch'd sarthest off, and the two honest
Ones nearer, but both on the North Shore of the Island,
so that they continued separate as before: And thus my
Island was peopled in three Places, and as I might say,
Three Towns were begun to be planted.
And here 'tis very well worth observing, that as it
often happens irl the World (what the wife Ends of God's
Providence are in such a Disposition of Things, I cannot
say) the two honest Fellows had the two worst Wives,
and the three Reprobates, that were scarce worth hanging,
that were fit for nothing, and neither seem'd bom to do.
themselves Good, or any one else, had three clever, dili-
gent, careful, and ingenious Wives; not that the two first
were ill Wives, as to their Temper or Humour; for all the
five were most willing, quiet, passive, and subjected Crea-
tures, rather like Slaves than Wives; but my Meaning is,
they were not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, or
alike cleanly and neat.
Another Observation T must make, to the Honour
of a diligent Application on one Hand) and to the Disgrace
of a slothful, negligent, idle Temper, on the other; that
when I came to the Place, and viewed the several Improve-
ments, Plantings, and Management' of the several little
Colonies; the two Men had so far out-gone the three, that
there was no Comparison; they had indeed both of them
as much Ground laid out for Corn as they wanted; and
the Reason was, because, according to my Rule, Nature
dictated, that it was to no Purpose to sow more Corn than
they wanted; but the Difference of the Cultivation, of the
Planting, of the Fences, and indeed every thing else,- was
easy to- be seen- at first View.
The two Men= had innumerable young Trees planted
about their Huts, that when you came to the Place, no-l
thing was to be seen but a Wood; and though they had
twice their Plantation demolished, once by their own
Countrymen, and once by the Enemy, as shall be shewn
in its Place; yet they had restored all again, and every
thing was thriving and flourishing about them; they
had Grapes planted in Order, and manag'd like a Vineyard,
though they had themselves never seen any thing of
that Kind ; and by their good ordering their Vines, their
Grapes were as good again as any of the others. They
had also found themselves out a Retreat in the thickest
Part of the Woods, where, though there was not a natu-
ral Cave, as I had found, yet they made one with inceflant
Labour of their Hands, and where, when the Mischief
which follow'd happen'd, they fccur'd their Wives and
Children so as they could never be found ; they having, by
sticking innumerable Stakes and Poles of the Wood, which.
as I said, grew so easily, made the Grove unpasiable, except
in one Place, where they climb'd up to get over the outside
Part i and then went in by Ways of their own leaving.
As to the three Reprobates, as I justly call them, tho'
they were much civiliz'd by their new Settlement, com-
par'd to what they were before, and were not so quarrel-
some, having not the lame Opportunity; yet one of the
certain Companions of a profligate Mind never left them,
and that was their Idleness: It is true, they planted Corn,
and made Fences; but Solomon's Words were never better
verified than in them: / went by the Vineyard of the Sloth-
ful, and it was all over-grown with Thorns; for when the
Spaniards came to view their Crop, they could not fee it
in some Places for Weeds; the Hedge had several Gaps in
it, where the wild Goats had gotten in, and eaten up the
Corn; perhaps, here and there a dead Bush was cramm'd
in, to stop them out for the present, but it was only
(hutting the Stable Door after the Steed was stoln. Whereas,
when they look'd on the Colony of the other two, there
was the very Face of Industry and Success upon all they
did; there was not a Weed to be seen in all their Corn,
or a Gap in any of their Hedges: And they on the other
hand verify'd Solomon's Words in another Place, That the
diligent Hand makes rich. For every thing grew and
thriv'd, and they had Plenty within and without; they
had more tame Cattle than the other, more Utensils
and Necesiaries within Doors, and yet more Pleasure and
Diversion too.
It is true, the Wives of the three were very handy
and cleanly within Doors; and having learn'd the Englifii
Ways of dressing and cooking from one of the other
English-
Englishmen, who, as I faid, was a Cook's-Mate on board
the Ship, they dress'd their Husbands Victuals very nicely
and well; whereas the other could not be brought to
understand it; but then the Husband, who, as I faid, had
been CookVMate, did it himselfr; but as for the Husbands
of the three Wives, they loitered about, fetch'd Turtles
- Eggs, and caught Fish and Birds ; in a Word, any thing
but Labour, and they far'd accordingly. The Diligent ltv'd
well and comfortably, and the Slothful liv'd hard and beg-
garly; and so I believe, generally speaking, it is all over the
World.
But now I come to a Scene, different from all that
had happened before, either to them or to me; and the
Original of the Story was this:
Early one Morning there came on Shore five or six
Canoes of Indians, or Savages, call them which you please;
and there is no Room to doubt that they came upon the
old Errand of feeding upon their Slaves: But that Part was
now ib familiar to the Spaniards, and to our Men too,
that they did not concern themselves about it, as I did;
but having been made sensible by their Experiences, that
their only Business was to lie conceal'd, and that, if they
were not seen by any of the Savages, they would go off
again quietly, when their Business was done, having as yet .
not the least Notion of there being any Inhabitants in the
Island; I fay, having been made sensible of this, they had
nothing to do but to give Notice to all the three Planta-
tions to keep within Doors, and not shew themselves,
only placing a Scout in a proper Place, to give Notice
when the Boats went off to Sea again.
This was without Doubt very right; but a Difaster
spoil'd all these Measures, and made it known among the
Savages, that there were Inhabitants there, which was in
the End, the Desolation of almost the whole Colony; after
the Canoes with the Savages were gone oft, the Spaniard*
peep'd abroad again, and some of them had the Curiosity
to go to the Place where they had been, to see what they
three. Savages left behind, and lying fast asleep upon the
Ground; it was iuppos'd they had either been so gorg'd
with their inhuman Feast, that, like Beasts, they were asleep,
and would not stir when the others went, or they were
wander'd into the Woods, and did not come back in
Time to be taken in.
had been doing: Here, to their

Surprize, they found
The
r 68 j
The Spaniards were greatly surpnVd at this Sighs,
and perfectly at a Loss what to do; the Spaniard-Gover-
nor, as it happened, was with them, and his Advice was-
asked, but he professed he knew not what to do ; as for
Slaves they had enough already, and as to killing them,
they were none of them inclined to that: The Spaniard-
Governor told me, they could not think of sbedding inno-
cent Blood; for as to them, the poor Creatures had done no
Wrong, invaded none of their Property, and they thought
they had no just Quarrel against them, to take away their'
Lives.
And here I must, in Justice to these Spaniards, ob-
serve, that let the Accounts of Spanish Cruelty in Mexico
and Pern be what they will, I never met with seventeen)
Men of any Nation whatsoever, in any foreign Country,
who were so universally modest, temperate, virtuous,
so very good-humour'd, and so courteous as these Spa-
niards; and as to Cruelty, they had nothing of it in their
very Nature; no Inhumanity, no Barbarity, no outrageous
Passions, and yet all of them Men of great Courage and
Spirit.
Their Temper and Calmness had appear'd, in their.
bearing the unsufferable Usage of the three Englishmen.)
and their Justice and Humanity appear'd now in the Case
of the Savages, as above: After some Consultation, they
resolved upon this, that they would lie still a while longer,
till, if possible, these three Men. might be gone; but then
the Governor-Spaniard recollected, that the three Savages
had no Boat; and that, if they were left to rove about the
Island, they would certainly discover that there were In-
habitants in it, and so they should be undone that way.
U bon this, they went back again, and there lay the
Fellows iast asleep still, so they resolved to waken them,
and t;ike them Prisoners, and they did so; the poor Fel»
lows were strangely frighted when they were seiz'd upon
and bound, and afraid, like the Women, that they should
be murdered and eaten; for, it seems, those People think
all the World do as they do, eating Mens Flesh; but they
were soon made easy as to that, and away they carried
them.
It was very happy to them that they did not carry
them home to their Castle, I mean to my Palace under
the Hill; but they carry'd them first to the Bower, where.
was the chief of their Country-work; such as the keep-
ing.
fng the Goats, the planting the Corn, &c. and afterwards
they carried them to the Habitation of the two English-
men.
Here they were set to work, though it was not much
they had for them to do: And whether it was by Negli-
gence in guarding them, or that they thought the Fel-
lows could not mend themselves, I know not, but one of
them run away; and taking into the Woods, they could never
tear of him more.
They had good Reason to believe he got home again
soon after, in some other Boats or Canoes of Savages,
who came on Shore three or four Weeks afterwards, and
who, carrying on their Revels as usual, went off again in
two Days time: This Thought terrify'd them exceed-
ingly; for they concluded, and that not without good
Cause indeed, that if this Fellow came safe home among
his Comrades, he would certainly give them an Ac-
count that there were People in the Island, as also how
few and weak they were; for this Savage, as I observ'd
before, had never been told, as it was very happy he had
not, how many they were, or where they liv.'d; nor had
he ever seen or heard the Fire of any of- their Guns, much
less had they shewn him any of their other retir'd Places,
soch as the Cave in the Vally, or the new- Retreat which
the two Englishmen had made, and the like.
The first Testimony they had that this Fellow had gi-
ven Intelligence of them, was, that about two Months
after this, lix Canoes of Savages, with about seven, or
eight, or ten Men in a Canoe, came rowing along the
North-side of the Island, where they never uled to come
before, and landed about an Hour after Sun-rise, at a con-
venient Place, about a Mile from the Habitation of the two
Engli/Imen, where this escaped Man had been kept: As the
Spaniard-Governor said, Had they been all there, the Da-
mage would not have been so much. for net a Man of them
'mould have escaped; but the Case differ'd now very much,
for two Men to fifty were too much Odds: The two
Men had the Happiness to diicover them about a League
off, so that it was above an Hour before they landed;
and, as they landed about a Mile from their Huts, it was
some time before they could come at them: Now,
having great Reason to believe that they were betray'd,
the first Ihing they did, was to bind the Slaves which
were left, and cause two of the three Men, whom they
'V brought
brought with the Women, who, it seems, prov'd very
faithful to them, to lead them with their two Wives, and
whatever they could carry away with them, to their re-
tir'd Place in the Woods, which I have spoken of above,
and there to bind the two Fellows Hand and Foot, till
they heard farther.
In the next Place, seeing the Savages were all come on
Shore, and that they bent their Course directly that way,
they open'd the Fences where their Milch-Goats were
kept, and drove them all out, leaving their Goats to straggle
into the Wood, whither they pleas'd, that the Savages
might think they were all bred wild; but the Rogue
who came with them was too cunning for that, and
gave them an Account of it all; for they went directly to
the Place.
When the two poor frighted Men had secur'd their
Wives and Goods, they sent the other Slave they had of
the three, who came with the Women, and who was at
their Place by Accident, away to the Spaniards, with all
Speed, to give them the Alarm, and desire speedy Help;
and in the mean time they took their Arms, and what
Ammunition they. had, and retreated towards the Place
in the Wood, where their Wives were sent, keeping at a
Distance, yet so that they might see, if possible, which
way the Savages took.
They had not gone far, but that, from a rising Ground,
they could see the little Army of their Enemies come on
directly to their Habitation, and in a Moment more, could
see all their Huts and Housliold-Stuff flaming up toge-
ther, to their great Grief and Mortification; for they had
a very great Loss, and to them irretrievable, at least for
some time. They kept their Station for a while, till
they found the Savages, like wild Beasts, spread themselves
all over the Place, rummaging every Way, and every Place
they could think of, in Search for Prey; and in particular
for the People, of whom it now plainly appear'd they had
Intelligence.
The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves
not secure where they stood, because as it was likely
some of the wild People might come that way, so they
might come too many together, thought it proper to
make another Retreat about half a Mile farther, believing,
as it afterwards happen'd, that the farther they stroll'd,
the fewer would be together.
The next Halt was at the Entrance into a very thick
grown Part of the Woods, and where an old Trunk of a
Tree stood, which was hallow and vastly large; and in this
Tree they both took their Standing, resolving to see there
what might offer.
They had not stood there long, but two of the Sa-
vages appear'd running directly that way, as if they had
already had Notice where they stood, and were coming up
to attack them; and a little way sarther, they lpy'd three
more coming after them, and five more beyond them, all
coming the same way; besides which, they law seven or
eight more at a Distance, running another way; for, in a
Word, they ran every way, like Sportsmen beating for their
Game.
The poor Men were now in great Perplexity, whether
they should stand and keep their Posture, or fly: But after a
very short Debate with themselves, they consider'd, that if
the Savages ranged the Country thus, before Help came,
they might, perhaps, find out their Retreat in the Woods,
and then all would be lost; so they resolv'd to stand them
there; and if there were too many to deal with, then they
would get up to the Top of the Tree, from whence they
doubted not to defend themselves, Fire excepted, as long as
their Ammunition lasted, though all the Savages that were
landed, which were near fifty, were to attack them.
Having resolv'd upon this, they next consider'd whe-
ther they should fire at the first two, or wait for the three;
and so take the middle Party, by which the two and the five
that follow'd would be separated; at length they resolv'd to
let the two first pasi by, unless they should spy them in the
Tree, and come to attack them. The two first Savages
also confirmed them in this Resolution, by turning a little
from them towards another Part of the Wood; but the
three, and the five after them, came forwards directly to the
Tree, as if they had known the Englishmen were there. -
Seeing them come so strait towards them, they re-
solv'd to take them in a Line, as they came; and as they
resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps the first Shot
might hit them all three; to which Purpose, the Man
who was to fire, put three or four Bullets into his Piece,
and having a sair Loop-hole, as it were, from a broken
Hole in the Tree, he took a sure Aim, without hgiog
seen, waiting till they were within about thirty Yards off
the Tree, so that he could not mits.
While
While they were thus waiting, and the Savages came
on, they plainly saw, that one of the three was the Run-
away Savage that had escaped from them, and they both
knew him distinctly, and resolved, that if possible, he
should not escape, tho' they should both fire; so the other
stood ready with his Piece, that if he did not drop at the
first Shot, he should be sure to have a second.
But the first was too good a Marksman to miss his
Aim i for as the Savages kept near one another, a little be-
hind in a Line, in a Word, he fir'd, and hit two of them
directly: The foremost was kill'd outright, being shot in
the Head: The second, which was the run-away Indian,
was shot through the Body, and fell, but was not quite
dead: And the third had a little Scratch in the Shoulder,
perhaps by the same Ball that went thro' the Body of the
second, and being dreadfully frighted, tho' not much hurt,
sat down upon the Ground, screaming and yelling in a
hideous Manner.
The five that were behind, more frighted with the
Noise, than sensible of their Danger, stood still at first; for
the Woods made the Sound a thousand times bigger
than it really was; the Echos rattling from one Side to
another, and the Fowls rising from all Farts, screaming
and making every Sort, a several Kind of Noise, according
to their Kind, just as it was when I fir'd the first Gun
that perhaps was ever shot off in that Place since it was
an Island.
However, all being silent again, and they not know-
ing what the Matter was, came on unconcern'd, till they
came to that Place where their Companions lay, in a Con-
dition miserable enough: And here the poor ignorant Crea-
tures, not sensible that they were within Reach of the
same Mischief, stood all of a Huddle over the wounded
Man, talking, and, as may be supposed, inquiring of him
how he came to be hurt; and who, 'tis very rational to
believe, told them, that a Flash of Fire first, and immedi-
ately after that, Thunder from their Gods, had kill'd
those two, and wounded him: This I say, is rational;
for nothing is more certain than that, as they saw no Man
near them, so they had never .heard a Gun in all their Lives,
or so much as htard of a Gun; neither knew they any
thing of killing or wounding at a Distance, with Fire
and Bullets; if they had, one might reasonably believe,
they would not have stood so unconcerned, in viewing
the Fate of their Fellows, without some Apprehension of
their own.
Our two Men, tho' as they confess'd to me, it grieved
'em to be oblig'd to kill so many poor Creatures, who at
the same Time had no Notion ot their Danger; yet having
them all thus in their Power, and the first having loaded
his Piece again, resolved to let fly both together among
them; and singling out, by Agreement, which to aim at,
they shot together, and kill'd or very much wounded four
of them; the [fifth, frightfd even to Death, though not
hurt, fell with the rest; so that our Men feeing them all
fall together, thought they had kill'd them all;
The Belief that the Savages were all kill'd, made our
two Men come boldly out from the Tree before they
had charg'd their Guns again, which was a wrong Step;
and they were under some Surprize when they came to the
Place, and found no less than four of the Men alive, and
of them two very little hurt, and one not at all: This
obliged them to sall upon them with the Stocks of their
Muskets; and first they made sore of the run-away Sa-
vage, that had been the Cause of all the Mischief, and
of another that was hurt in his Knee, and put them out
-of their Pain; then the Man that was not hurt at all,
came and kneel'd down to them, with his two Hands
held up, and made piteous Moan to them by Gestures and
Signs, for his Life; but could not say one Word to them
that they could understand.
However, they sign'd to him to fit down at the Foot
of a Tree thereby; and one of the Englishmen, with a
Piece of Rope-Twine, which he had by great Chance,
in his Pocket, ty'd his two Feet sast together, and his two
Hands behind him, and there they left him; and, with
what Speed they could, made after the other two, which
were gone before; fearing they, or any more of them,
should find the Way to their cover'd Place in the Woods,
where their Wives, and the few Goods they had left
lay: They came once in Sight of the two Men, but it was at
a great Distance; however, they had the Satissaction to
fee them cross over a Vally towards the Sea, the quite
contrary Way from that which led to their Retreat, which
they were afraid of; and being satisfy'd with that, they
went back to the Tree, where they left their Prisoner,
who, as they .fuppos'd, was deliver'd by his Comrades;
for he was gone, and the two Pieces of Rope-Yarn, with
D Whicji
-which they had bound him, lay just at the Foot of the
Tree.
They were now in as great a Concern as before, not
Jcnowing what Course to take, or how near the Enemy
might be, or in what Numbers; so they resolv'd to go
away to the Place where their Wives were, to fee if all
was well there, and to make them easy, who were ia
fright enough to be sure; for tho' the Savages were their
own Country-Folk, yet they were most terribly afraid of
them, and perhaps the more, for the Knowledge they had
of them.
When they came thither, they found the Savages had
been in the Wood, and very near the Place; but had not
sound it; for indeed it was inaccessible, by the Trees
standing so thick, as before, unless the. Persons seeking it
-had been directed by those that knew it, which these were
not; they found, therefore, every Thing very lafe, only
the Women in a terrible Fright: While they were here,
they had the Comfort of seven of the Spaniards coming to
their Assistance; the other ten, with their Servants, and
old Friday, I mean "Friday's Father, were gone in a Body
to defend their Bower, and the Corn, and Cattle that
was kept there, in case the Savages should have rov'd
over to that Side of the Country; but they did not spread
so far: With the seven Spaniards came one of the Savages,
who, as I said, were their Prisoners formerly; and with
them also came the Savage, whom the Englishmen had left
hound Hand and Foot at the Tree; for it seems they came
that way, sew the Slaughter of the seven Men, and un-
bound the eighth, and Drought him along with them;
where however, they were obliged to bind him again, as
they had done the two others, who were left when the
third run away.
The Prisoners began now to be a Burden to them;
and they were so afraid of their escaping, that they thought
they were under an absolute Necessity to kill them for their
own Preservation: However, the Spaniard-Governor
would not consent to it, but order'd, that they should be
sent out of the Way, to my old Cave in the Vally, and
be kept there with two Spaniards to guard them, and give
them Food, which was done; and they were bound there
Hand and Foot for that Night.
When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so
encouraged, that they coukj not fatisfy themselves to stay
* any
any longer there, but taking five of the Spaniard], and
themselves, with four Mufqucts and a Pistol among them,
and two stout Quarter-staffs, away they went in Quest of
the Savages: And first, they came to the Treee where the
Men lay that had been kill'd; but it was easy to fee, that
some more of the Savages had been there; for they had
attempted to carry their dead Men away, and had dragg'd
two of them a good way; but had given it over: From
thence they advanc'd to the first rising Ground, where
they had stood, and seen their Camp destroy'd, and where
they had the Mortification still to see some of the Smoak;
but neither could they here fee any of the Savages: They
then resolv'd, tho' with all possible Caution, to go forward
towards their ruin'd Plantation: but a little before they
came thither, coming in Sight of the Sea-shore, they faw
plainly the Savages aU embarking again in their Canoes, in
order to be gone.
They scem'd sorry at first, that there was no way to
come at them, to give them a parting Blow: But, upon
the whole, were very well fkisfy'd to be rid of them.
The poor Englishmen being now twice ruin'd, and all their
Improvements destroy'd, the rest all agreed to come and
help them rebuild, and to assist them with needful Supplies.
Their three Countrymen, who were not yet noted for
having the least Inclination to do any Good, yet as soon
as they heard of it, (for they living remote Eastward, knew
nothing of the Matter till all was over') came and offer'd
their Help and Assistance, and did very friendly Work for
several Days, to restore their Habitations, and make Ne-
cessaries for them; and thus in a little Time, they were
set upon their Legs again.' .
About two Days after this, they had the farther. $itif-
faction of seeing three of the Savages Canoei come driving
on Shore, and at some Distance from them, .two 'drowned
Men; by which they had Reason to believe, that they had
met with a Storm at Sea, and had overset some.of them;
for it had blown very hard the Night after they went off.
However, as some might miscarry, so on the other
hand, enough of them escap'd to inform the rest, as well
of what they had done, as of what happen'd to t.Tie'm; and
to whet them on to another Enterprize of the .fame Na-
ture, which they, it seems, resolved to attempt, whh suffi-
cient Force to carry all before them; for, except what the
fkst Man had told them of Inhabitants, they could fay little
p * t«i
rto it .of their own Knowledge; for they never saw one
Man, and the Fellow being kill'd that had affirm'd it, they
had no other Witness to confirm it to them.
"It was five .or six Months after this, before they heard
any more of the Savages; in which Time our Men were
in Hopes they had either forgot their former bad Luck, or
given over the Hopes of better; when on a sudden, they
were invaded with a most formidable Fleets of no less than
»8 Canoes full of Savages arm'd with Bows and Arrows,
great Clubs, wooden Swords, and such like Engines of
War; and they brought such Numbers with them, that, in
short, it put all our People into the utmost Consternation.
A s they came on Shore in the Evening, and at the
Eastermost Side of the Island, pur Men had that Night to
consult and consider what to ido; and, in the first Place,
knowing that their being intirely conceal'd, was their
-only Safety before, and would much more be so now,
while the Number of their Enemies was so great; they
therefore resolv'd, first of all, to take down the Huts which
were built for the two Englishmen, and drive away their
Coats to the old Cave; because they suppos'd the Savages
would go directly thither, as soon as it is was Day, to play
the old Game over again, tho' they did not now land within
two Leagues of it.'
In the next Place, they drove away all the Flock of
Goats they had at the old Bower, as I call'd it, which be-
long'd to the Spaniards; and, in short, le£t.as little Appear-
ance of Inhabitants any where as was possible; and the
next Morning early they posted themselves with all their
Force at the Plantation of the two Men, waiting for their
coming: As they guefs'd, so it happen'd; these new In-
vaders leaving their Canoes at the East End of the Island,
came ranging along the Shore directly towards the Place,
to the Number of 15-0, as near as our Men could judge.
Our Army was but small indeed; but that which was
worse, they had not Arms for all their Number neither:
The whole Account, it seems, stood thus: First, as to Men;

each end of it, and by his Side a Hatchet; also every one
of our Men had Hatchets; Two of the Women could not
be prevail'd upon, but they would come into the Fight,
and they had Bows and Arrows, which the Spaniards
had taken from the Savages, when the first Action hap-
pens, which I have spoken of, where the Indians fought
with one another, and the Women had Hatchets too.
The Spaniard Governor, whom I have described Co often,
commanded the whole; and William Atkins, who, though
a dreadful Fellow for Wickedness, was a most daring bold
Fellow, commanded under him. The Savages came for-
ward like Lions, and our Men, which was the worst of
their Fate, had no Advantage in their Situation; only that
Will. Atkins, who now prov'd a most useful Fellow, with
fix Men, was planted just behind a small Thicket of Bushes,
as an advane'd Guard, with Orders to let the first of them
pass by, and then fire into the middle of them ; and, as
soon as he had fir'd, to make his Retreat as nimbly as
he could round a Part of the Wood, and so come in be-
hind the Spaniards where they stood, having a Thicket of
Trees all before them.
When the Savages came on, they run straggling about
every way in Heaps, out of all manner of Order, and Wil-
liam Atkins let about fifty of them pass by him, then seeing
the rest come in a very thick Throng, he orders 3 of his
Men to fire, having loaded their Mufquets with 6 or 7
Bullets a-piece, about as big as large Pistol-Bullets. How
may they kill'd or wounded, they knew not; but the Con-
sternation and Surprize was inexpressible among the Sava-
D 3 ges;
ges; they were frighted to the last Degree, to hear fiicn a
dreadful Noise, and see their Men kill'd, and others hurt,
but fee no body that did it; when, in the Middle of their
Fright, William Atkins, and his other three, let fly again
among the thickest of them; and in less than a Minute,
the first three being loaded again, gave them a third Volley.
Had William Atkins and his Men retir'd immediately,
as soon as they had fir'd, as they were order'd to do; or,
had the rest of the Body been at hand to have pour'd in
their Shot continually, the Savages had been effectually
routed; for the Terror that was among them came prin-
cipally from this, viz. That they were kill'd by the Gods
-with Thunder and Lightning, and could fee no body that
hurt them; but William Atkins staying to load again, dis-
covers the Cheat: Some of the Savages who were at a
Distance, spying them, came upon them behind, and tho"
Atkins and his Men fir'd at them also, two or three times,
and kill'd above twenty, retiring as fast as they could, yet
they wounded Atkins himself, and kill'd one of his Fel-
low- Englishmen with their Arrows, as they did afterwards
one Spaniard, and one of the Indian Slaves who came with
the Women; this Slave was a most gallant Fellow, and
fought most desperately, killing five of them with his own
Hand, having no Weapon but one of the arm'd Staves and
a Hatchet.
Our Men being thus hard laid at. Atkins wounded, and
two other Men kill'd, retreated to a rising Ground in the
Wood; and the Spaniards, after firing three Vollies upon
them, retreated also; for their Number was so great, and
they were so desperate, that tho' above jo of them were
kill'd, and more than so many wounded, vet they came
on in the Teeth of our Men, fearless ot Danger, and shot
their Arrows like a Cloud; and it was observ'd, that their
wounded Men, who were not quite disabled, were made
outrageous by their Wounds, and fought like Madmen.
When our Men retreated, they left the Spaniard and
the Engli/l;man that were kill'd behind them; and the Sa-
vages, when they came up to them kill'd them, over again
in a wretched Manner, breaking their Arms, Legs and
Heads, with their Clubs and wooden Swords, like true
Savages: But finding our Men were gone, they did not
(eem to pursue them, but drew themselves up in a kind of
a Ring. which is, it seems, their Custom, and shouted
twice, in token of their Victory: After which, they had
the
the Mortification to see several of their wounded Men sall*
dying with the mere Loss of Blood.
The Spaniard-Cover dot having drawn his little Body
up together upon a rising Ground, Atkins, though he was
wounded, would have bad him march'd and charg'd them
again all together at once: But the Spaniards reply'd, Seignior
Atkins,.jlou fee how their wounded Men fight, Ut them alone
till Morning; all these wounded Men will be stiff and sore
with their Wounds, and saint with the Loss of Blood; and so
we shall have the fewer to engage.
The Advice was good: But Will. Atkins reply'd mer-
rily, That's true, Seignior, and so shall 1 too; and that's
the Reason I would go on while I am warm. Well, Seignior
Atkins, says the Spaniard, you have behav'd gallantly,
and done your Part; we will fight for you, if you cannot
come on; but I think it best to stay till Mornings so they
waited.
But as it was a clear Moon-light Night, and they
found the Savages in great Disorder about their dead and
wounded Men, and a great Hurry and Noise among them-
where they lay, they afterwards resblv'd to sall upon them
in the Night, especially if they could come to give 'em
but one Volley before they were discover'd: This they
had a fair Opportunity to do; for one of the two English-
men, in whoie Quarter it was where the Fight begun, led
'em round, between the Woods and the Sea-side, West-
ward, and then turning short South, they came so near
where the thickest of 'em lay, that before they were seen
or heard, 8 of 'em fir'd in among 'em, »nd did dread fil
Execution upon 'ena; in half a Minute more, eight others
fir'd after them, pouring in their small Shot in such a
Quantity, that Abundance were kill'd and wounded; and
all this while they were not able to fee who hurt 'em, or
which way to rly.
The Spaniards charg'd again with the utmost Expedi-
tion, and then divided themselves into three Bodies, and
relblv'd to sall in among 'em altegether: They had in
each Body eight Persons, that is to say, 14, whereof were
a1 Men, and the two Women, who, by the way, fought
desperately.
They divided the Fire-arms equally in each Party,
and sb of the Halberds and Staves: They would have had
the Women keep back; but they said, they were resolv'd
to die with their Husbands. Having thus form'd their
P 4 little
little Army, they march'd out from among the Tfees, and
came up to the Teeth of the Enemy, shouting and hal-
looing as loud as they could; the Savages stood altoge-
ther, but were ia the utmost Confusion, hearing the Noise
of our Men shouting from three Quarters together; they
would have fought, if they had seen us: And as soon as
we came near enough to be seen, seme Arrows were shot,
and poor old Friday was wounded, tho' not dangerously:
But our Men gave them no Time; but running up to 'em,
fir'd among 'em three ways, and then fell in with the
But-cnds of their Mufquets, their Swords, arm'd Staves,
and Hatchets, and laid about 'em so well, that, in a word,
they set »p a dismal Se reaming and Howling, flying to lave
their Lives which way soever they could.
Our Men were tir'd with the Execution; and kill'd,
or mortally wounded in the two Fights; about 180 of
them; the rest, being frighted out of their Wits, scour'd
thro' the Woods, and over the Hills, with all the Speed
and Fear that nimble Feet could help 'em to do; and as
we did not trouble ourselves much to pursue them, they
got all together to the Sea-side where they landed, and
where their Canoes lay: But their Disaster was not at an
End yet; for it blew a terrible Storm of Wind that
Evening from the Sea-ward; so that it was impossible for
them to put off; nay, the Storm continuing all Nighr,
when the Tide came up, the,ir Canoes were most of 'em
driven by the Surge of the Sea so high upon the Shore,
that it requir'd infinite Toil to get them off; and some
of them were even dash'd to Pieces against the Beach, or
against one another.
Our Men, tho' glad of their Victory, yet got little Reft
that Night; but having refresh'd themselves as well as they
could, they resolv'd to march'd to that Part of the Island
where the Savages were fled, and see what Posture they
were in. This necessarily led them over the Place where.
the Fight had been, and where they found several of the
poor Creatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering
Life; a Sight disagreeable enough to generous Minds; for
a truly great Man, tho' oblig'd by the Law of Battle to
destroy his Enemy, takes no Delight in his Misery.
However, there was no Need to give any Orders
in this Case; for their own. Savages, who were their
Servants, dispatched those poor Creatures with their -
Hatchets. - -":
A t length they came in View of the Place where the
more miserable Remains of the Savages Army lay, where
there appear'd about i oo still; their Posture was generally
fitting upon the Ground, with their Knees up towards
their Mouth, and the Head put between the two Hands,
leaning down upon the Knees.
When our Men came within two Musquet-shot of 'em,
the Spaniard Governor order'd two Musquets to be fir'd
without B;ill, to alarm them; this he did, that by their
Countenance he might know what to expect, viz.. Whe-
ther they were still in Heart to fight, or were so heartily
beaten, as to be dispirited and discouraged, and so he might
manage accordingly.
This Stratagem took; for, as scon as the Savages heard
the first Gun, and sew the Flash of the second, they started
np upon their Feet in the greatest Consternation imagin-
able; and as our Men advanc'd swiftly towards 'em, they
all ran screaming and yawling away, with a kind of an
howling Noise, which our Men did not understand, and
had never heard before; and thus they ran up the Hills
into the Country.
A t first, our Men had much rather the Weather had
been calm, and they had all gone away to Sea: But they
did not then consider, that this might probably have been
the Occasion of their coming again in such Multitudes as
not to be resisted, or, at least, to come so many, and so
often, as would quite desolate the Island, and starve 'em:
Will. Atkins therefore, who, notwithstanding his Wound,
kept always with 'em, prov'd the best Counsellor in this
Case: His Advice Was, To take the Advantage that offcr'd,
and clap in between them and their Boats, and so deprive
them of the Capacity of ever returning any more to plague
the Island.
Tfc e y consulted long about this, and some were against
it, for fear of making the Wretches fly to the Woods, and
live there desperate; and so they should have them to hunt
like wild Beasts, be afraid to stir out about their Business;
and have their Plantations continually rifled, all their tame
Goats destroy'd, and, in short, be reduc'd to a Life of con-
tinual Distress.
Will. Atkins told them, They had better have to do with
roo. Men, than with 100 Nations: That as they must
destroy their Boats, so they must destroy the Men, or be all of
thtm destroy'd themselves. In a Word, he shew'd 'em the
D j Necessity
Necessity ot it so- plainly, that they all came into it i &
they went to work immediately with the Boats, and get-
ting some dry Wood together from a dead Tree, they try'd
to set some of 'em oa fire, but they were so wet, that
they would not burn: However, the Fire so burn'd the
upper Part, that it soon made 'em unfit for swimming
in the Sea as Boats. When the Indians saw what they
were about, some of them came running out of the
Woods; and coming as near as they could to our Mea,
kneel'd down and cry'd, Oa, Oa, Waramokoa, and some
other Words of their Language, which none of the others
understood any thing of > but as they made pitiful Gestures,
and strange Noises, it was easy to understand, they begg'd
to have their Boats sear'd, and that they would be gone,
and never come there again.
But our Men were now satisfied, that they had no way
to preserve themselves, or to save their Colony, but effec-
tually to prevent any of these People from ever going home
again; depending upon this, that if ever so much as one of
'em got back into their Country to tell the Story, the
Colony was undone; so that letting 'em know that they
Ihould not have any Mercy, they fell to work with- their
Canoes, and destroy'd 'em every one, that the Storm had
not destroy'd before; at the Sight of which, the Savages
rais'd a hideous Cry in the Woods, which our People heard
plain enough; after which they ran about the Island like
distracted Men; so that, in a word, our Men did not really
know at first what t» da with them.
Nor did the Spaniards, with all their Prudence,. con-
sider, that while they made those People thus desperate,
they ought to have kept good Guard at the same time
upon their Plantations; tortho' it is true, they had driven
away their Cattle, and the Indians did not find out theis
main Retreat, I mean my old Castle at the Hill, nor the
Cave in the Valley; yet they found out my Plantation at
the Bower, and pull'd it all to Pices* and all the Fences
and Planting about it; trod all the Corn under Foot; tore
up the Vines and Grapes, being just then almost ripe, and
did our Men an inestimable Damage, tho' to themselves
not one Farthig's worth of Service.
T h o' our Men were able to fight them upon all- Oc-
casions, yet they were in no Condition to pursue 'em, or
hunt 'em up and down; for as they were too nimble of
"" . """ Foot
I 8'f J
Foot for our Men; when they found them single, so our
Men durst not go about single, for fear of being surrounded
with their Numbers: The best was, they had no Weapons,
for tho' they had Bows, they had no Arrows left, nor any
Materials to make any, nor had they any edg'd Tool or
\Veapon among them.
The Extremity and Distress they were reduc'd to was
great, and indeed deplorable; but at the same time, our
Men were also brought to very hard Circumstances by 'em;
for tho' -their Retreats were preserved, yet their Provision
was destroy'd, and their Harvest spoiled, and what to do,
or which way to turn themselves they knew not: The
only Refuge they had now, was the Stock of Cattle they
had in the Vally by the Cave, and some little Corn which
grew there: The three Englishmen, William Atkins, and
his Comrades, were now reduc'd to two, one of 'em be-
ing kill'd by an Arrow which struck him on the Side of
his Head, just under the Temple, so that he never spoke
more; and it was very remarkable, that this was the
fame barbarous Fellow who cut the poor Savage Slave
with his Hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have
murder'd the Spaniards.
'I l o o k ' d upon their Case to have been worse at this
Time, than mine was at any Time, after I first discover'd
the Grains of Barley and Rice, and got into the Method
of planting and raising my Corn, and my tame Cattle;
for now they had, as 1 may say, a hundred Wolves upon
the Island, which would devour every thing they could
come at, yet could very hardly be come at themselves.
The first thing they concluded, when they saw what
their Circumstances were, was, that they would, if poffu
ble, drive them up to the sarther Part of the Island, South-
East, that if any more Savages came on Shore, they might
not find one another; then, that they would daily hunt
and harrass 'em, and kill as many of 'em as they could come
at, till they had reduced their Number; and if they could
at last tame 'em, and bring 'em to any thing, they would
give 'em Corn, and teach 'em how to plant and live upon
their daily Labour.
I n order to this, they so follow'd 'em, and so terrify'd
'em with their Guns, that in a few Days, if any of 'em
fired a Gun at an Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he would .
sall down for fear; and so dreadfully frighted they were,
that they kept out of Sight sarther and sarther, till at last:
D 6 '"'"" our
[84 J
cur Men following 'em, and every Day almost killing and"'
wounding some or 'em, they kept up in the Woods andi
hollow Places so much, that it reduc'd 'em to the utmost
Misery for want of Food; and many were afterwards found'
dead in the Woods, without any hurt, but merely starved
to Death.
When our Men found this, it made their Hearts relent,
and Pity mov'd 'em; especially the Spaniard. Governor, who-
was the most Gentleman-like, g«ncrous-minded Man that
ever I met with in my Life; and he propos'd, if possible,.
to take one of 'em alive, and bring him to understand what
they meant, so far as to-be able to act as Interpreter, and
to go among 'em; and see it they might be brought to-
some Conditions, that- might be depended upon to save
their Lives* and to do us no Spoil.
It was seme while before any of 'em could be taken;
but being weak and half starv'd, one of them was at last
&rpriz.'d and made a Prisoner; he was- sullen at first, and
would neither eat nor drink, but finding himself kindly
used, and Victuals given him, and no Violence offer'd him,.
he at last grew tractable, and came to himself.
They brought old Friday to him, who talked often.
with him, and told him how kind the others-would be to
'em all; that they would not only save their Lives, but
would give 'em a Part of the Island to live in, provided-
they would give Satissaction, that they would keep in-
their own Bounds, and not come beyond 'em, to injure or
prejudice others; and that they should have Corn given,
'em, to plant and make it grow for their Bread, and some-
Bread given 'em for their present Subsistance; and old Fri-
day bad the Fellow go and talk with the rest of his Coun-
trymen, and-sce what they said to it, assuring 'em, that if:
they did not agree immediately they should be all destroy'd.
The poor Wretches thoroughly humbled, and reduc'dL
in Number to about thirty-seven,- clos'dwith the Proposal-
at the first Offer, and begg'd to have some Food given 'em -r
upon which 1i Spaniards, and-1 Englisstimen well arm'd, and j.
Indian Slaves-, and old Friday, marched to. the Place where they
were; the 3 Indian Slaves carry'd 'em a large Quantity of Bread,
and some Rice boiled up to Cakes, and dry'd m the Sun, and 3
live Goats; and they were order'd to go,to the Side of an Hill,'
where they fat down, eat the Provisions very thankfully, and;
were the most saithful Fellows to their Words that could-
be thought. of-; for, except when.they-came to. beg Victuals
and Directions, they never came out of their Bounds £
and there they liv'd when 1 came to the Island, and I went
re see them.
They had taught them both to- plant Corn, make
Bread, breed tame Goats, and milk them;- they wanted
nothing but Wives, and they soon would have been a Na-
tion: They were confined to a Neck of Land, surrounded
with high Rocks behind them, and lying plain toward*
the Sea before them,. onthe South* East Corner ot the Island:
They had Land enough, and it was very good and fruitful,
for they had a Piece of Land about a Mile and half broad,
3 or 4 Miles in Length. . ..;
Our Men taught them to make wooden Spades, fuck
as I made tor my self, and gave them among them i»
Hatches, and 3. or 4 Knives ;- and there they liv'd the
most subjected innocent Creatures, that ever were heard
of.
After this, the Colony enjoy'd a perfect Tranquil-
lity, with respect to the Savages, till I came to re-visit
them, which was in about 2 Years: Not but that now
tmd then, some Canoes of Savages came on Shore for
their triumphal unnatural Feasts;- but as they were of se-
veral Nations, and, perhaps, had never heard of those
>hat came before, or the Reason of it, they did not make
any Search or Enquiry after their Countrymen; and if
they had, it would have been very hard for. them to have
found them out.
Thus, I think, I have given a full Account of all that
happen'd to them, to my Return, at least, that was worth
Notice. The Indians, or Savages, were wonderfully civi-
lized by them, and they frequently went among them, but
forbid, on Pain of Death. any one of the Indians coming to-
them, because they would not have their Settlement betray'd
again.
One Thing was very remarkable, -viz.. that they taught
the Savages to make Wicker-work, or Baskets ; but they-
soon out-did their Masters; for they made Abundance of
most ingenious things in Wicker-work;- particularly, all
Sorts of Baskets, Sieves, Bird-Cages, Cupboards, &c. as
also Chairs to sit on, Stools, Beds, Couches, and abundance
of other things, being very ingenious at such Work, when-
they were once put in the Way of it-
Mr Coming was a particular Relief to these People,
because we. furnish'd. them- with Knives, Scislars, Spades,
-"" — - Shor
Shovels, Pick-Axes, and all things of that Kind which
they could want.
With the Help of these Tools they were so very
handy, that they came, at last, to build up their Huts, or
Houses, very handsomely; raddling, or working it up like
Basket-work all the Way round, which was a very extra-
ordinary Piece of Ingenuity, and look'd very odd, but was
an exceeding good Fence, as well against Heat, as against all
Sorts of Vermin; and our Men were so taken with it,
that they got the wild Savages to come and do the like for
them; so that when I came to fee the two Englishmens
Colonies, they look'd, at a Distance, as if they liv'd all
like Bees in a Hive; and as for Will. Atkins, who was
now become a very industrious, neceslary, and sober Fel-
low, he had made himself such a Tent of Basket-work, as
I believe was never seen; it was 120 Paces round in the
Out-side, as I measur'd by my Steps; the Walls were as
elose-work'd as a Basket, in Pannels or Squares, 32 in
Number, and very strong, standing about 7 Foot high; in
the Middle was another not above 22 Paces round, but
built stronger, being eight-square in its Form, and in the
8 Corners stood 8 very strong Posts, round the Top of
which he laid strong Pieces pinn'd together with wooden
Pins, from which he rais'd a Pyramid before the Roof of
8 Rafters, very handsome, I assure you, and join'd toge-
ther very well, though he had no Nails, and only a few
Iron Spikes, which he had made himself too, out of the
old Iron that I had left there and indeed, this Fellow
ftiew'd Abundance of Ingenuity in several things which he
had no Knowledge of; he made himself a Forge, with a
Pair of wooden Bellows to blow the Fire; he made him-
self Charcoak for his Work, and he form'd out of one of
the Iron Crows,a middling-good Anvil to hammer upon;
in this Manner he made many Things, but especially Hooks,
Staples and Spikes, Bolts and Hinges : But to return to the
House; after he had pitch'd the Root of his innermost
Tent, he work'd it up between the Rafters with Basket-
work, so firm, and thatch'd that over again so ingeniously
with Rice-straw, and over that a larpe Leaf of a Tree,
which cover'd the Top, that his He sewas as dry as if it
had been til'd or slated. Indeed, he own'd, That thi Sava-
ges made the Basket-work for him .
The outer Circuit was cove? d, as a Lean-to, all round
this inner Apartment, and long Rafters lay from the 32
Angles
Angles to the Top Posts of the inner House, being about
ao Foot distant; so that there was a Space like a Walk,
within the outer Wicker-wall, and without the inner, near
20 Foot wide. -
The inner Place he partitions off with the sameWiek-
er-work, but much sairer, and divided it into 6 Apart-
ments, so that he had 6 Rooms on a Floor, and out or"
every one of these there was a Door; first, into the Entry,
or Coming into the main Tent, and another Door into
the Space or Walk that was round it; so that Walk was
also divided into fix equal Parts, which serv'd not only for
Retreat, but to store up any Necessaries which the Family
had Occasion for. These six Spaces not taking up the
whole Circumference, what other Apartments the outer
Circle had, were thus order'd: As soon as you were in at
the Door of the outer Circle, you had a short Passage strait
before you to the Door of the inner House ; but on either
Side was a Wicker Partition, and a Door in it, by which;
you went, first, into a large Room or Store-house, 10/
Foot wide, and about 30 Foot long, and thro' that into*
another not quite so long; so that in the outer Circle were
10 handsome Rooms, 6 of which were only to be corns
at thro' the Apartments of the inner Tent, and fcrv'd as
Closets or retir'd Rooms to the respective Chambers of
the inner Circle; and 4 large Ware-houses or Barns, or
what you please to calt them, which went in thro' one
another, two on either hand of the Passage, that led thro?
the outer Door to the inner Tent.
Such a Piece of Basket-work, I believe, was never
seen in the World; nor an House, or Tent, so neatly con*
triv'd, much less, so built: In this great Bee-hive liv'd the
3 Families, that is to say, Will. Atkins and his Companion -r
the third was kill'd, but his Wife remain'd with 3 Children }
for she was, it seems, big with Child. when he dy'd, and
the other two were not at all backward to give the Widow
her full Share of every Thing, I mean, as to their Corn*
Milk, Grapes, and when they kill'd a Kid, or found »
Turtle on the Shore; so that they all liv'd well enough,
tho' it was true, they were not so industrious as the other
two, as has bees observ'd already. - .
One Thing, however, cannot be omitted, -viz. That
as for Religion, I don't know that there was any thing of
that kind among them; they pretty often, indeed, put one
another ia Mind* tkttf tfrtre mi a Qfi, by the very com-
mon
mon Method of Seamen, viz. swearing by his Name:
Nor were their poor ignorant Savage-Wives much the
better for having been marry'd to Christians, as we must
call them; for as they knew very little of God themselves,
so they were utterly uncapable of entering into any Dis-
course with their Wives about a God, or to talk any thing
to them concerning Reiigion.
The utmost ot all the Improvement which I can siy
the Wives had made for them, was, that they had taught
them to speak English pretty well; and all the Children they
had, which was near" lo in all, were taught to speak Englifi
too, from their first learning to speak, tho' they at first
spoke it in a very broken Manner, like their Mothers.
There were none of these Children above fix Years old
when I came thither, for it was not much above seven'
Years that they had fetch'd these five Savage Ladies over,
but they had all been pretty fruitful, for they had all Chil-
dren, more or less: I think the Cook's Mate's Wife was
big of her sixth Child; and the Mothers were all a good
Sort of well-govern'd, quiet, laborious Women, modest
and decent, helpful to one another, mighty observant and
subject to their Masters, I cannot call them Husbands; and
wanted nothing but to be well instructed in the Christian
Religion, and to be legally marry'd ;- both which wera
happily brought about afterwards by my Means, or, at leastr
by the Consequence of my coming among them.
Having thus given an Account of the Colony in ge-
neral, and pretty much of my five Runagate Engliflimen, I
must say something of the Spaniards, who were the main
Body of the Family; and in whose Story there are some
Incidents also remarkable enough.
I h a o a great many Discourses with them- about their
Circumstances, when they were among the Savages: They
told me readily, that they had no Instances to give of their
Application or Ingenuity in that Country ; that they were
a poor miserable dejected Handful of People; that if Means
had been put into their Hands, they had yet so abandon'd
themselves to Despair, and so sunk under the Weight of
fcheir Misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but Starv-
ing: One of them, a grave and very sensible Man, told
me, he was convinced they were in the wrong; that it
was not the Part of wise Men, to give up themselves to*
their Misery, but always to take hold of the Helps which
Reason. ofler'd, as well for present Support, as for futurs
'Deli-
Deliverance: He told me, that Grief was the mostsenftlese
insignificant Passion in the World ; for that it regarded
only things past, which were generally impossible to be re-
call'd, or to be remedy'd, but had no View to things to
come, and had no Share in any thing that look'd like De-
liverance, but rather added to the Affliction, than proposed
a Remedy: And, upon this, he repeated zSpaniftr Proverb;
-which though I cannot repeat in just the same Words that
he spoke it, yet I remember I made it into an English Pro-
verb of my own, thus:
In Trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your Trouble doubled.
H e ran on then, in Remarks upon all the little Improve-
ments I had made in my Solitude; my unweary'd Appli-
cation, as he call'd it, and how I had made a Condition,
which in its Circumstances, was at first much worse than
theirs, a thousand Times more happy than theirs was, evetr
now, when they were all together: He told me, it was
remarkable, that Englishmen had a greater Presence of Mind
in their Distress, than any People that ever he met with;'
that their unhappy Nation, and the Portuguese, were the'
worst Men in the World to struggle with Misfortunes; for
that their first Step in Dangers, after common Efforts are
over, was always to despair, lie down under it, and die,
without rousing their Thoughts up to proper Remedies
[ 89 1
I told him, their Case and mine differed exceedingly;
that they were cast upon the Shore without Necessaries,
without Supply of Food, or of present Sustenance, till they
could provide: That it is true, I had this Disadvantage
and Diseomfort, that I was alone; but then the Supplies I
had providentially thrown into my Hands, by the unex-
pected driving of the Ship on Shore, was such a Help as
wou'd have encouraged any Creature in the World to have
apply'd himself as I have done : Seignior, says the Spaniard,
had we poor Spaniards been in your Case, we should never
have gotten half those Things out of the Ship as you
did : Nay, s»ys he, we should never have found Means
to have gotten-a Raft to carry them, or to have gotten a
Raft on Shore without Boat or Sail; and how much eft
Would we havedone, said he, if any of us had been alone?
Well, I defir'd him to abate his Compliment, and go on.
with
with the History of their coming on Shore, where they
landed ; he told me, they unhappily landed at a Place
where there werePeople without Provisions; whereas, had
they had the common Sense to have put off to Sea again,
and gone to another Island a little farther, they had found
Provisions, tho' without People; there being an Island
that Way, as they had been told, where there were Pro-
visions, though no People; that is to fay, that the Spaniards
of Trinidad had frequently been there, and had fill'd the
Island with Goats and Hogs at several Times; where they
have bred in such Multitude, and where Turtle and Sea-
Fowls were in such Plenty, that they could have been in
no Want of Flesh, tho' they had found no Bread; whereas
here, they were only sustained with a few Roots and
Herbs, which they understood not, and which had no
Substance in them, and which the Inhabitants gave them
iparingly enough, and who could treat them no better,-
unless they would turn Canibals, and eatMens Flesh, which
was the great Dainty of their Country.
Thby gave me an Account how many Ways they
strove to civilize the Savages they were with, and to teach
them rational Customs in the ordinary Way of Living, but
in vain; and how they retorted it upon them, as unjust,
that they who came thither for Assistance and Support, should
attempt to set up for Instructors of those that gave them
the Instructors of others, but those who could live without
them.
They gave me dismal Accounts of the Extremities they
were driven to ; how sometimes they were many Days
without any Food at all; the Island they were upon being
inhabited by a sort of Savages that lived more indolent,
and for that Reason were less supplyM with the Necesfa-
ries of Life, than they had Reason to believe others were
in the fame Part of the World; and yet they found, that
these Savages were less ravenous and voracious, than those
whe had better Supplies of Food.
Also they added, That they could not but see with
what Demonstrations of Wisdom and Goodness the govern-
ing Providence of God directs the Event of Things in
the World; which, they faid, appear'd in .their Circum-
stance; for if prested by the Hardships they were under,
and the Barrenness of the Country where they were, they
had scarch'd after a better Place to live in, they had then
Bread

it seems, that none should set up for
been
keen out of the Way of the Relief that happened to them
by my Means.
Then they gave me an Account, how the Savages, whom
they liv'd among, expected them to go out with them in-
to their Wars: And it was true, that, as they had Fire-
Arms with them, had they not had the Disaster to lose
their Ammunition, they should not have been serviceable
only to their Friends, but have made themselves terrible
both to Friends, and Enemies; but being without Powder
and Shot, and yet in a Condition, that they could not in
Reason deny to go out with their Landlords to their Wars;
when they came into the Field of Battle, they were in a
worse Condition than .the Savages themselves; for they
neither had Bows nor Arrows, nor could they use those
the Savages gave them; se that they could do nothing bus'
stand still, and be wounded with Arrows, till they came up
to the Teeth of their Enemy; and then indeed the three
Halbards they had, were of use to them ; and they would
often drive a whole little Army before them, with those
Halbards and sharpened Sticks put into the Muzzles of their
Muiquets: But that for all this they were sometimes
surrounded with Multitudes, and in great Danger from.
their Arrows; till at last they found the Way to make
themseleves large Targets of Wood, which they covered
with Skins of wild Beasts, whose Names they knew not;
and these covered them from the Arrows of the Savages;
that notwithstanding these, they were sometimes in great
Danger, and were once five of them knock'd down toge-
ther with the Clubs of the Savages, which was the Time
when one of them was taken Prisoner; that is to say, the
Spaniard, whom I had relieved: That at first they thought
he had been kill'd, but when afterwards they heard he was
taken Prisoner, they were under the greatest Grief imagin-
able, and would willingly have all ventur'd their Lives
to have rescued him.
They told me, That when they were so knock'd down,
the rest of their Company rescued them, and stood over
them, fighting till they were come to themselves, all but
he who they thought had been dead; and then they made
their Way with their Halbards and Pieces, standing close
together in a Line, thro' a Body of above a thousand Sa-
vages, beating down all that came in their Way, got the
Victory over their Enemies, but to their great Sorrow,.
because it was with the Loss of their Friend » wham, the
other
other Party finding him alive, carry'd offwith some others,
as I gave an Account in my former.
They describ'd most affectionately, how they were
fiirpriz'd with Joy at the Return of their Friend and Com-
panion in Misery, who they thought had been devoured
by wild Beasts of the worst kind, (viz..} by wild Men;
and yet how more and more they were siirpriz'd with the
Account he gave them of his Errand, and that there was
a Christian in any Place near, much more one that was
able, and had Humanity enough to contribute to their De-;
liverance.
They described how they were astonished at the Sight
of the Relief I sent them, and at the Appearance of Loaves
of Bread, Things they had not seen since their coming to
that miserable Place; how often they cross'd it, and blessed
it as Bread sent from Heaven; and what a reviving Cor-
dial it was to their Spirits to taste it; as also of the other
Things I had sent for their Supply. And after all, they
would have told me something of the Joy they were in,
at the Sight of a Boat and Pilots to carry 'em away to the
Person and Place from whence all these new Comforts
carne; but they told me, It was impossible to express it by
Words, for their excesftme Joy, naturally driving them to un-
becoming Extravagancies, they had no -stay to describe them,
but by telling me, that they border'd upon Lunacy, having
no stay to give Vent to their Passion, suitable to the Sense
that was upon them; that in some it worked one way, and
in some another; and that some of them, through a Surprize
of Joy, would burst out into Tears ; others be half mad, and
others immediately saint. This Discourse extremely affected
me, and call'd to my Mind Friday's Extasy, when he met
his Father and the poor People's Extasy, when I took 'era
up at Sea, after their Ship was on fire: The Mate of the
Ship's Joy, when he found himself deliver'd in the Place
where he expected to perish; and my own Joy, when,
after i8 Years Captivity, I found a good Ship ready to
carry me to my own Country: All these Things made me
more sensible of the Relation'of those poor Men, and more
affected with it.
Having thus given a View of the State of Things,
as I sound 'em, I must relate the Heads of what I did
for these People, and the Condition in which I left 'em.
It was their Opinion, and mine too, that they would be
troubled rut mor* with the Savagei; or that, if they were,
* - they
s93 3
they would be able to cut them off, if they were twice as
many as before; so that they had no Concern about that.
Then 1 enter'd into a serious Discourse with the Spaniard
whom I call'd Governor, about their Stay in the Island;
for, as I was not come to carry any of them off, so it
would not be just to carry off some, and leave others,
who, perhaps, would be unwilling to stay, if their Strength
was diminished.
O n the other hand, I told them, I came to establish 'em
there, not to remove 'em; and then I let 'em know, that
I had brought with me Relief of sundry Kinds for them;
that I bad been at a great Charge to supply them with all
things necessary; as well for their Convenience, as their
Defence; and that I had such and such particular Persons
with me, as well to increase and recruit their Number, as,
by the particular necessary Employments which they were bred
to, being Artificers, to assist them in those Things, in which,
at present, they were to seek. »
They were all together when I talk'd thus to them;
and before I deliver'd to 'em the Stores I had brought, I
ask'd 'em, one by one, If they had intirely forgot, and
bury'd the first Animosities that had been among them, and
could shake Hands with one another, and engage in a striH
friendship and Union of Interest, that so there might be no
more Mifunderstandings or Jealousies.
William Atkins, with abundance of Frankness and Good-
humour, did, They had met with Afflictions enough to
make them all sober, and Enemies enough to make them all
Friends; that, for his Part, he would live and die with
them; and was so sar from designing any thing against the
Spaniards, that he own'd, they had done nothing to him,
but what his own mad Humour made necessary, and what
he would have dene, -and perhaps much worse, in their Cafe;
and that he would ask them Pardon, if I desir'd it, for the
foolish and brutish Things he had done to them; and was
.very willing and desirous of living in Terms of intire Friend*
JJiip and Union with them; and would do any thing that lay
in his Power to convince them of it; and as for going to
England, he cared not if he did not go thither these twenty
Xeari.
The Spaniards faid, They had indeed, at first, difarm'd
and excluded William Atkins and his two Countrymen for
their ill Conduct, as they had let me know; and they ap-
feaFd to me, for the Necessity they were under to do so:
But
4
But that William Atkins had behav'd himself so bravely ht
the great Fight they had with the Savages, and on several
Occasions since; and had shtw'd himself so saithful to, and
concerned for the general Interest of them all, that they had
forgotten all that was fast, and thought he merited as much
to be trusted with Arms, and supplied with Necessaries, as
any of thtm; and that they had testified their Satissaction
in him, by committing the Command to him, next to the
Governor himself: And as they had an imire Confidence
in him, and all his Countrymen, so they acknowledged, they
bad merited that Confidence, by all the Methods that honest
Men could merit to be valued and trusted; and they most
heartily embraced the Occasion if giving me this Assurance,
that they would never have any Interest separate from one
another.
Upon these frank and open Declarations of Friend-
ship, we appointed the next Day to d ine all together;
and indeed we made a splendid Feast': I caused the Ship's
Cook and his Mate to come on Shore, and dress our
Dinner; and the old Cook's Mate we had on Shore, assisted:
We brought on Shore six Pieces of good Beef, and four
Pieces of Pork out of the Ship's Provision, with our Punch-
Bowl, and Materials to fill it; and in particular, I gave
'em ten Bottles of French Claret, and ten Bottles of Eng-
lish Beer; things that neither the Spaniards, or the Eng-
lishmen had tasted for many Years; and which, it may be
supposed, they were exceeding glad of.
The Spaniards added to our Feast five whole Kids, which
the Cooks roasted; and three of them were sent cover'd up
close, on board the Ship, to the Seamen, that they might
seast on fresh Meat from on Shore, as We did with their
salt Meat from on board.
After. this Feast, at which we were very innocently
merry, I brought out my Cargo of Goods, wherein, that
there might be no Dispute about dividing, I shew'd them
there was sufficient for them all; and desir'd, that they
might all take an equal Quantity of the Goods that were
for wearing; that is to say, equal when made up; as first,
I distributed Linen sufficient to make every one of them
four Shirts; and at the Spaniards Request afterwards made
them up six; these were exceeding comfortable to them,
having been what, as I may say, they had long since for-
got the use of, or what it was to wear them.
1 allotted the thin English Stuffs, which I men-
'tion'd before, to make every one a light Coat, like a
Frock, which I judg'd fittest for the Heat of the Season,
cool and loose; and order'd, that whenever they decay'd,
they should make more, as they thought fit: The like for
Pumps, Shoes, Stockings, and Hats, &c.
I cannot express what Pleasure. what Satissaction,
fat upon the Countenances of all these poor Men, when
they saw the Care I had taken of them, and how well I
had furnish'd them; they told me, I was a Father to tbtm,
.tmd that having such a Correspondent as I was, in so remote a
Part of the World, it would make them forget that they were
left in a desolate Place; and they all voluntarily engaged to
me, Not to leave the Place without my Consent.
T h e n I presented to them the People I had brought
with me, particularly the Taylor, the Smith, and the two
Carpenters, all of 'em most necessary People; but above all,
my general Artificer, than whom they could not name
any thing that was more useful to them; and the Taylor,
to shew his Concern for 'em, went to work immediately,
and, with my Leave, made them every one a Shirt the first
thing he did ,- and, which was still more, he taught the
Women not only how to sew and stitch, and use the
Needle, but made them assist to make the Shirts for their
Husbands, and for all the rest.
A s to the Carpenters, I scarce need mention how use-
ful they were; for they took in pieces all my clumsy un-
handy Things, and made them clever convenient Tables,
Stools, Bed-steads, Cupboards, Lockers, Shelves, and every
thing they wanted ot that kind.
But to let them see how Nature made Artificers at-
first, I carry'd the Carpenters to see William Atkins's Bas-
ket-house as I call'd it; and they both own'd, They never
saw an Instance of such natural Ingenuity before; nor any
thing so regular, and so handily built, at least of its kind:
And one of them, when he saw it, after musing a good
while, turning about to me, I am sure, says he, that Man
has no need of us, you need do nothing but give him Tools.
T h e n I brought them out all my Store of Tools, and
gave every Man a Digging-Spade, a Shovel, and a Rake,
for we had no Harrows or Ploughs; and to every sepa-
rate Place, a Pickax, a Crow, a broad Ax, and a Saw; al-
ways appointing, that as often as any were broken, or
- worn
4
worn out, they should be supply'd, without grudging, out
of the general Stores that I left behind.
Nails, Staples, Hinges, Hammers, Chillels, Knives,
Scistart, and all Sorts of Tools, and Iron-work, they had
without Tale, as they requir'd; for no Man would! care to
take more than they wanted, and he must be a Fool that
would waste or spoil them, on any Account whatever; and
for the Use of the Smith, I left two Ton of unwrought
Iron for a Supply. S
M y Magazine of Powder and Arms, which I brought
them, was such, even to Profusion, that they could not but
rejoice at them, for now they could march as I us'd to
do, with a Musquet upon each Shoulder, if there was Oc-
casion, and were able to fight iooo Savages, if they had
but some little Advantages of Situation, which also they
could not miss of, if they had Occasion.
I carry'd on Shore with me the young Man, whole
Mother was starv'd to Death, and the Maid also; she was
a sober, well-educated, religious young Woman, and be-
hav'd so inoffensively, that every one gave her a good
"Word i she had indeed an unhappy Lire with us, there
being no Woman in the Ship but herself; but she bore it
with Patience: After a While, seeing things so well-order'd,
and in so fine a Way of thriving upon my Island, and con-
sidering, that they had neither Business nor Acquaintance in
the East-Indies, or Reason for taking so long a Voyage: I
lay, considering all this, both of them came to me, and de-
sir'd I would give them Leave to remain on the Island, and
be enter'd among my Family, as they call'd it.
I a g r e e'd to it readily, and they had a little Plat of
Ground allotted to them, where they had three Tents or
Houses set up, surrounded with a Basket-jrork, palisado'd
like Atkins's, and adjoining to his Plantation: Their Tents
were contriv'd so, that they had each of them a Room apart
to lodge in, and a middle Tent like a great Store-house to
lay all their Goods in, and to eat and drink in ,- and now
the other two Engishmen remov'd their Habitation to the
same Place, and so the Island was divided into 3 Colonies
and no more, niz. the Spaniards, with Old Friday, and the
first Servants, at my old Habitation under the Hill; which
was, in a Word, the capital City; and where they bad so
enlarged and extended their Works, as well under, as on
the Outside of the Hill, that they liv'd, tho' perfectly con-
ceal'd, yet full at large: Never was there such a little
City
City in a Wood, and so hid, I believe, in any Part of the
World; for I verily believe, 1000 Men might have ranged
the Island a Month, and if they had not known there was
such a thing, and look'd on Purpose for it, they would
not have found it; for the Trees stood so thick and so
close, and grew so fast matted into one another, that
nothing but cutting them down first, could discover the
Place; except the two narrow Entrances, where they went
in and out, could be found, which was not very easy; on«
of them was just down at fcne Water's Edge on the Side
of the Creek, and it was afterwards above loo Yards to
the Place; and the other was up the Ladder at twice, as
I have already formerly described it; and they had a large
Wood thick planted also, on the Top of the Hill, which
contain'd above an Acre, which grew apace, and cover'd
the Place from all Discovery there, with only one narrow
Place between two Trees not easy to be difcover'd, to enter
on that Side.
The other Colony was that of Will. Atkins's, where
there were .4 Families of Englishmen, I mean those I had
left there, with their Wives and Children; 3 Savages that
were Slaves; the Widow and Children of the Englishman
that was kill'd; the young Man and the Maid; and by the
Way, we made a Wife of her also, before we went away:
There were also the two Carpenters and the Taylor, who
I brought with me for them; also the Smith, who was
a very necessary Man to them, especially as a Gunsmith, to
take Care of their Arms; and my other Man, who I call'd
Jack of all Trades; who was in himself as good, almost
as 20 Men, for he was not only a very ingenious Fellow,
but a very merry Fellow; and before I went away, wa
roarry'd him tofthe honest Maid that came with the Youth
in the Ship, who I mention'd before.
And now I speak of Marrying, it brings me naturally
to fay something of the French. Ecclesiastic that I had
brought with me out of the Ship's Crtw, who I took up
at Sea. It is true, this Man was a Roman, and perhaps,
it may give Offence to some hereafter, if I leave any
thing extraordinary upon Record, of a Man, who, before
I begin, I must (to set him out in just Colours) represent
in Terms very much to his Difadvantage, in the Account
of Prfteftants ;as first, that he was a Papists idly, a Pgpfb
triest; and 3d!y, a French Pepish Priest,
But
But Justice demands of me to give him a due Character;
and I must say, He was a grave, sober, pious, and most re-
ligious Person; exact in his Life, extensive in his Charity,
and exemplary in almost every thing he did ; what then can
any one fay, against my being very sensible of the Value
-of such a Man, notwithstanding his Profession? though it
may be my Opinion, perhaps, as well as the Opinion of
others, who shall read this, that he was mistaken.
- The first Hour that I be^an to converse with him, after
he had agreed to go with me to the East-Indies, I found
Reason to delight exceedingly in his Conversation; and
-fae first began with me about Religion in the most obliging
M inner imaginable.
Si r, says he, Xou have not only, under God, ('and at
that he crosi'd his Breast) sav'd my Life, but you haxe ad-
mitted me'to go this Voyage in your Ship, and by your obliging
Civility, have taken me into your Family, giving me an Op-
portunity of free Conversation. Now, Sir, says he, you fee,
by my Habit, what my Profession is, and I guess by ycur
Nation, what yours is : I may think it is my Duty, and
doubtless it is so, to use my utmost Endeavours, on all Occa-
sions, to bring all the Souls I can to the Knowledge of the
Truth, and to embrace the Catholick Doctrine ; but, at I
am here under your Permission, and in your Family, I am
bound, in Justice to your Kindness as well as in Decency and
good Manners, to be under your Government ; and therefore,
I shall not, without your Leave, enter into any Debates on
the Points of Religion, in which we may not agree, sarther
than you shall give me Leave.
I told him, his Carriage was so modest, that I could
not but acknowledge it; that it was true, we were such Peo-
ple as they call'd Hereticks; but that he was not the firji
Catholick that I had conversed with, without salling into any
Inconveniencies, -or carrying the Questions to any Height in
Debate; that he should not find himself the worse us'd for
being of a different Opinion from us. and if we did not con-
vale without ar.y Dislike on either Side upon that Score, it
iwould be his Fault not ours.
'> H e reply'd, That he thought, our Conversation might be
easily separated from Disputes: that it was not his Business
to cap Principles with every Man he difeours'd with; andthat
he rather defiVd me to converse with him as a Gentleman,
than as a Religieuso^*b*t if I would give him Leave at
any Tme to difcosrfe upon religims Si.bjetts, he would readily
„ com-
comply with it; and that then he did not doubt but 1 would
allow him also to defend his own Opinions, as well as he
could; but that, without my Leave, he would not break in
ttpon me with any such Thing.
H e told me sarther, That he would not cease to do all
that became him in his Office, as a Priest, as well as a pri-
vate Christian, to procure the Good of the Ship, and the
Safety of all that was in her; and though perhaps we would
not join with him, and he could not pray with us, he hoped
he might pray for us, which he would do upon all Occasions:
In this Marnier we convers'd, and as he was of a most
obliging Gentleman-like Behaviour; so he was, if I may
be alsow'd to say so, a Man of good Sense, and, as I believe,
of great Learning.
H e gave me a most diverting Account of his Life, and
of the many extraordinary Events of it; of many Adven-
tures which had besallen him in the few Years that he had
been Abroad in the World, and particularly this was very
remarkable, viz. That during the Voyage he was now en-
gaged in, be had the Misfortune to be five Times fhip'd and
unsl;ifd, and never to go to the Place whither any of the
Ships he was in, were at first defign'd: That his first Intent
-mas to have gone to Martinico, and that he went on board
a Ship bound thither, at St. Ma lo ; but being forced into
Lisbon, by bad Weather, the Ship received some Damage,
by running a-ground in the Mouth of the River Tagus, and
if as obliged to unload her Cargo there; that. finding a Por-
tuguese Ship there bound to the Madeiras, and ready to sail,
and supposing he should easily meet with a Vessel there bound
to Martinico; he went on board, in order to sail to the Ma-
deiras; but the Master of the Portuguese Ship being but an in-
different Mariner, had been out in his Reckoning, and they
drove to Fial; where, however, he happen'd to find a vers
good Market for his Cargo, which was Corn, and therefore,
refolv'd not to go to the Madeiras, but to had Salt at the
Isle of May, and to go away to Newfoundland .- He had
no Remedy in this Exigence, but to go with the Ship, and
had a pretty good Voyage as far as the Banks, so they call
the Place where they catch the Fish, where meeting with a
French Ship, bound from France to Quebeck, in the River
of Canada, and from thence to Martinico, to carry Provi-
sions, he thought he should have an Opportunity to compleat
his first Design: But when he came to Quebeck, the Mastir
of the Ship dy'd, and the Ship proceeded no farther; so the
E z next
.n-jct Voyage he shipsd himself for France, in the Ship that
was burnt, when we took them up at Sea, and then shipp'd
them with. us for jthe East-Indies, as I have already said:
Thus he had been disappointed in five Voyages, all, as I
may call it, in one Voyage, besides what I shall have Oc-
calion to mention sarther of the same Person.
But I shall not make Digressions into other Mens
Storjes, which have no Relation to my own. I return
to what copcerns our Afsair in the Island: He came to me
one Morriipg, for he lodg'd among us all the while we
were upon she Island; and it happen'd to be just when
I was going to yisit.the Englishmens Golony, at the sarthest
Part of the Island ; I sajr, he came to me, and told me,
with a very grave Countenance, That he had for twa or
three Days depr'd an Opportunity of Jome Discourse with
me, which. he hoped should not be displeasing to me, because
he thought it might, in some measure, correspond with my
general Design, which was the Prosperity .of my new Colony,
and perhaps might put it, at least more than. he yet thought
it was, in the Way of God's Blessing.
I too£'d a little surpriz'd at the last Part of his Dis-
course > and turning a little short, How, Sir, said I, Can
ft be said, that wg are not in the Way of God's Blessing,
after such -visible Assistances, and wonderful Deliverances, as
we have seen here, and of which 1 have given you a large
Account?
I f you had pleas'd, Sir, said he (with a World of Mo-
desty, and yet with great Readiness} to have heard me, you
would have found no Room to have been displeased, much less
to think so hard os me, that I should suggest, that you have
mt had wonderful Assistances and Deliverances; and I hope,
on your Behalf, that you are in the Way of God's Blessing,
and your Design is exceeding good, and will prosper: But
Sir, laid he, though it were rrore so, than is even pospble tp
you, yet there-may be some among you, that are not equally
right in their Actions: And you know, that in the Story
of Israel, one Achan in the Camp removed God's Blessing
from them, and turned his Hand so against them, that
2.6 of them, though not concerned in the Crime, were the
Objects of Divine Vengeance, and bore the Weight of that Pu-
nishment.
1 w a s sensibly touch'd with his Discourse, and told
him,. His Inference was so justi and the whole Design feem'd
[a sincere, and was really so religious in its own Nature,
that
t loi 5
that I was very sorry I had interrupted him, and' begg'd
him to go on; and in the mean Time, because it seeni',f
that what we had both to say, might take up some Time,
I told him, I was going to the Englishmen'* PUntations,'
and ask'd him to go with me, and we might discourse of
it iy the Way: He told me, he would more willingly wait en
me thither, because there, partly, the Thing was acted,
which he desir'd to speak to me about; so we walk'd on,
and I press'd him to be free and plain with me, in what h(
had to say.
Why then, Sir, says he, be pleased to give me Leave'
to lay down a few Proposition!, as the Foundation of what'
1 have to say, that we may not differ in the general Prin-
ciples, though we may be of some differing Opinions in the'
PralUce of Particulars. First, Sir, though we differ in some'
of the Doctrinal Articles of Religion ; and it is very un-
happy that it is so, especially in the Case before us, as I
shall shew afterwards: Xet there are some general Principles:
in which we both agree, viz. First, that there is a God;
and that this God having given us some stated general'
Rules for our Service and Obedience, we ought not willingly
and knowingly to offend him; either by neglecting to ds
what he has commanded, or by doing what he has ex-
fresty forbidden: And let our different Religions be whet''
they will, this general Principle is readily own'd by us all,
That the Blessing of God does not ordinarily follow a pre-
sumptuous finning against his Command; and every good
Christian will be affectionately concerned to prevent any that'
are under his Care, living in a total Neglect of God and
hit Commands. It is not your Men being Protestants,
whatever my Opinion may be of such, that discharges me
from being concern'd for their Souls, and from endeavour-
ing, if it lies before me, that they should live in as little
Distance from, and' Enmity with their Maker as postible;
especially, if you give me Leave to meddle so sar in your
Circuit. f
I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told
him, I granted all he had said, and\hanked him, that he
would so far concern himself for us; and begg'd he would
explain the Particulars of what he had ebferv'd, that, like
Joshua, (to take his own Parable) I might put away the
accursed Thing from us.
Why
Why thin, Sir, fays he, I will take the liberty you
give me; and there are three things, which, if I am right,
must stand in the Way of God's Blessing upon your "Endeavour s
here, and which I should rejoice for your Sake, and their own,
to fee remov'd. And, Sir, fays he, J promife myself, that
you will fully agree with me in them all, assaon as I name
them; especially, because I shall convince you, that every one
of them may, with great Ease, and very much to your Sa-
tissaction, be remedy'd.
H e gave me no Leave to put in any more Civilities,
but went on." First, Sir, fays he, you have here 4 English-
men, who have fetch'd Women from among the Savages, and
have taken them as their Wives, and have had many Chil-
dren by them all, and yet are not marry'd to them after
any stated legal Manner, as the Laws of God and Man
require; and therefore are yet, in the Sense of both, no lest
than Adulterers, and living in Adultery. To this, Sir, lays
he, I know you will object; that there was no Clergyman
or Priest of any Kind, or of any Profession, to perform the
Ceremony ; nor any Pen and Ink, or Paper, to write down
a Contract of Marriage, and have it sign'd between them.
And I know also, Sir, what the Spaniard Governor has
told you; I mean, of the Agreement that he obliged them
to make, when they took these Women, viz. That they should
chuse them out by Consent, and keep separately to them;
which, by the Way, is nothing of a Marriage, no Agreement
with the Women as Wives, but only an Agreement among
themselves, to keep them from quarrelling.
But, Sir, the Essence of the Sacrament of Matrimony
(so he call'd it, being a Reman) consists not only in the mu-
tual Consent of the Parties to .take one another, as Man and
Wife, but in the formal and legal Obligation, that there is
in the Contrail, to compel the Man and Woman at all
Times, to own and acknowledge each ether; obliging the
Man to abstain from all other Women, to engage in no other
Contract while these subsist; and on all Occasions, as Ability
allows, to provide honestly for them and their Children; and
to oblige the Women - to the fame, or like Conditions, mutati*
mutandis, on their Side,
Now, Sir, fays he, these Men may, when they please,
or when Occasion presents, abandon these Women, disown
their Children, leave them to perish, and take other Women,
and marry them whilst these are living. And here he
added, with some Warmth, How, Sir, is God honour'd in
this
this unlawful liberty? And how shall a Blessing succeed your
Endeavours in this Place, however good in themselves, and
however fincere in your Design, while these Men, who at
fresent are your Subjecls, under your absolute Govern-
ment and Dominion, are allow'd by you to live in op en A-
dulteryi
I confess, I was struck at the thing it self, but
much more with the convincing Arguments he supported
it with; for it was certainly true, that though they had no-
Clergyman upon the Spot, yet a formal Contract on both
Sides, made before Witnesses, and confirm'd by any Token,
.which they had all agreed to be bound by, though it
had been but the breaking a Stick between them, engaging
the Men to own these Women for their Wives upon all
Occasions, and never to abandon them, or their Children;
and the Women to the fame with their Husbands, had
been an effectual lawful Marriage in the Sight of God;
and it was a great Neglect that it was not done.
But I thought to have gotten off with my young
Priest, by telling him, That all that Part was done when I
was not here, and they had liv'dso many Tears with them now,
that, if it was an Adultery, it was past Remedy, they could
do nothing in it now.
Sir, fays he, asking your Pardon for such Freedom,
you are right in this, that it being done in your Absence,
you could not be charged with that Part of the Crime:
But I beseech you, flatter not your self, .that you are not there-
fore under an Obligation to do your uttermost now, to put an
End to it: How can you think, but that, let the Time
past lie on whom it will, all the Guilt, for the futttre, will
lie entirely upon you f because it is certainly in your Power
now to put an End' to it, and in no Body's Purser but
yours. . . ,
I w.As so dull still, that I did not take him right; but'
I imagined, that by putting an End to it, he meant, that
I should part them, and not fustier them to live together
any longer: And I faid to him, I could not Jo that by
any means, for that it would put the whole Ifland in Con-
fusion: He seem'd surpriz'd that I should so fas mistake
him. No, SW, says he, I .do not mean, that you stwuld
now separate them, but legally and tsfecluxlly marry them
now; and as, Sir, my Way of marrying them may not be
Jo easy to reconcile them to, though it will be as effectual,
even by your own Laws ; so your Way may be as well be-

fore Cod, and as valid among Men ; I mean, by a written
Contract, fign'd by both Man and Woman, and by all the Wit-
nesses present, wnkh all the Laws of Europe would decree
to be valid.
I w a s amaz'd to fee so much true Piety, and so much
Sincerity of Zeal, besides the unusual Impartiality in his
Discourse, as to his own.Party or Church; and such a true
Warmth for the preserving People that he had no Know-
ledge ot, or Relation to; I say, for preserving them from
transgressing the Laws of God; the like of which, I had
iiideed not met with any where: But recollecting what he
had said, of marrying them by a written Contract, which
I knew would stand too; I return'd it back upon him,
and told him, I granted all that he had said to be just, and
on his Part very kind, that I would discourse with the Men
upon the Point now, when I came to them: And I knew
, no' Reason why they should scruple to let him marry them
ally which I knew well enough would be granted to be as
-' -*authentick and valid in England, as if they were marry'd by
one of our own. Clergymen : What was afterwards done
in. this Matter, I shall ipeak of it by itself.
I then press'd him to tell me what was the second Com-
plaint which he had to make, acknowledging, that I was
very much his Debtor for the first, and thanVd him heartily
for it: He told me, he would use the fame Freedom and
Slainnefs in the second, and hop'd I would take it as well:
And this was, that notwithstanding these English Subjects
of mine, as he caU'd them, had liv'd with those Women
for almost seven Years, and had taught them to speak
English, and even to read it ; and that they were, as he
perceived, Women of tolerable Understanding, and capable
of Instruction; yet they had not to this Hour taught them
any thing of the Christian Religion; no, not so much as to
know that there was a God, or a Worship, or in what Man-
ner God was to be served, or that their own Idolatry, and
worshipping they knew not who, was false and absurd.
This, he said, was an unaccountable Neglect, and what
God would certainly call them to account for, and perhaps
at last take the Work cut of their Hands : He spoke . this
very affectionately and warmly. I am persuaded, says he,
had those Men lived in the Savage Country, whence their
Wives came, the Savages would have taken more Pains to
have brought them to be Idolaters, and to worstiip the Devil,
than any of these Men, so far as he could see, hatt taken with
them,
them to teach them the Knowledge of the true God: Now,
Sir, said he, tho' I do not acknowledge your Religion, or you
mine, yet we should be all glad to see the Devil's Servants,
and the Subjects of his Kingdom, taught to know the general
Principles of the Christian Religion; that they might, at least,
hear of God, and of a Redeemer, and of the Resurrection,
and of a future State, Things which we all believe; they had
at least been so much nearer coming into the Bosom of the true
Church, than they are now in the publick Profession of Idolatry,
and Devil-worship.
I could hold no longer; I took him in my Armft and
embrac'd him with an Excess of Passion: How far, said-1
so him, have I been from understanding the most essentfal
Part of a Christian, (viz.) to love the Interest of the Chri-
stian Church, and the Good of other Mens Souls. I scarce
have known what belongs to being a Christian. O, Sir,
do not say so, reply'd he, this Thing is slot your Fault: No,
says I, but why did I never lay it to Heart as well as you?
"Tis not too late yet, said he, be not too forward to con-
demn yourself: But what can ke done now said I, you see
I am going away? Will you give me leave, £aid he, to talk
with those poif Men about it? Yes, with all my Heart,
laid I, and will oblige them to give heed to -what you say
too. As to that, said he, we must leave them to the Mercy
tff Christ; but 'tis our Business to assist them, encourage them,
and instruct them, and if you will give me leave, and
GoJ his Blessing, / do not doubt but the poor ignorant Souls
shall be brought home into the great Circle of Christianity, if
not into the particular Faith that we all embrace, and that
even while you stay here. Upon this, I said, I shall not only
give you leave, but give'you a thousand Thanks for it. What
follow'd on this Account, I shall mention also again in hs
Place.
r'HCWpress'd him for the third Article, in which we
Were to blame; Why really. says he, if is of the same Na-
ture, and I will proceed, asking your leave, with the fame
Plainness as before; it is about your poor Savages yonder,
who are, as I may say, your conquer'd Subject's: It is a
Maxim, Sir, that is, or ought to be receiv'd among all Chri-
stians, of what Church, or pretended Church soever, {viz )
That Christian Knowledge ought to be propagated by all pos-
sible Means, and on all possible Occasions; 'Tis on this Prin-
ciple that our Church sends Missionaries into Persia, India,
and China; and that our Clergy, even of the superior sort,
E f willing; c
willingly engage in the most hazardous Voyages, and the
most dangerous Residence among Murderersand Barbarians,
to teach them the Knowledge of the true God, and to
bring Bern over to embrace the Christian Faith: Now,
Sir, you have fitch an Opportunity hert, to have fix or seven
and thirty poor Savages brought over from Idolatry to the
Knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I won-
der how you can pass such an Occasion of doing good, which is
really worth the Expence of a Man's whole Life.
I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one Word
to say: I had here a Spirit of true Christian Zeal for God
and Religion before me, let his particular Principles be of
what kind soever; as' for me, I had not so much as enter-
tain'd a Thought of this in my Heart before, and 1 believe
should not have thought of it; for I look'd upon these Sa-
vages as Slaves, and People, whom, had we any Work for
them to do, we would have used as such, or would have
been glad to have transported them to any other Part of
the World; for our Business was to get rid of them, and
we would all have been satisfy'd, if they had been sent to
any Country, so they had never seen their own: But to the
Case, I say, 1 was confounded at his Discourse, and knew
not what Answer to make him: He look'd earnestly at
me, seeing me in some Disorder; Sir, said he, I shall be
very sorry, if what I have said gives you any Offence:
No, no, said I, / am offended with no body but myself;
but I am perfectly confounded, not only to think that ! should
never take any notice of this before, but with restecting what
notice I am able to take of it nova; Tou know, Sir, said I,
what Circumstances I am in, I am bound to the East-Indies,
in a Ship freighted by Merchants, and to whom it would be
an insufferable Piece of Injustice to detain their Ship here, the
Men lying all this while at Victuals and Wages upon the
Owners Account: It is true, I agreed to be allow'd twelve
Days here, and if I stay more, I must pay 31. Sterling per
Diem Demerage, nor can I stay upon Demorageabove eight
Days more, and I have been here thirteen Hays already, so
that I am perfectly unable to engage in this Work, unless I
would suffer myself to be lest behind here again, in which
Case, if this single Ship should miscarry in any Part of her
Voyage, I should be just in the same Condition that I was
left in here at first, and from which I have been so wonder-
fully delivered, '.
He
r io7- r
H E own'd the Case was very hard upon me as to my
Voyage; but laid it home upon my Conscience, Whether
the Blessing of saving seven and thirty Souls, was not worth
my venturing all I had in the World for? I was not so
sensible of that as he was, and I return'd upon 'em rhtw;
Why, Sir, it is a valuable Thing indeed, to be an Instru-
ment in God's Hand to convert seven and thirty Heathens
to the Knowledge of Christ; but as you are an Ecclesiastic!;,
and art given over to that Work, so that it seems-naturally
to sall into thi way of your Profession; how is it then, that
you do not rather offer yourself to undertake it, than press
me to it?
Upon this he sae'd about, just before me, as he walked'
along, and putting me to a full Scop, made me a very low-
Bow; I most heartily thank God, and you, S,r, says he,
for giving me so evident a Call to so blessed a Work; and is
you think yourself discharg'd from it. and desire me to un-
dertake it, I will most readily do it, ttnd think it a happy'
Reward for allthe Hazards and Difficulties of such a broken,
disappointed Voyage as I have met with, that I have dropt at.
last into so gloritus a Work.
I DiscovER'D'a kind of Rapture in his Face whiie he
spake this to me; his Eyes sparkled like Eire, his Fuce
glow'd, and his Colour came-and went, as if he had been
falling into Fits; in a word, he was fir'd with the Joy ot
being embark'd in such a Work. I paus'd a.considerable
.while, before I could tell what to say to .him, tor I was
really surpriz'd to find a Man of such Sincerity and Zeal,
and carry'd out in his Zeal, beyond the ordinary Rare of
.Men, not of his Profession only, but even of any Pro-
fession whatsoever: But after 1 had considered it.a while,.
Xl ask'd him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he-
would venture on the single Consideration of an Attempt
on those poor People, to be lock'd up in an unplanted
Island for, perhaps, his Life; and at last might not know
whether he should be able to do them any good, or not? .
H e turn'U short upon me, and ask'd me what I call'd a
Venture? Pray, Sir, hid he, what do you think I confzvted
to go in jour Ship to the East-Indies for? Nay, slid \that
I know not, unless it was to preach to the Indians. Doubt-
less it was said he; and do you think if I can convert these -
seven and thirty Men to the Faith of Christ, it is not worth
my Time, though I slwuld never be setch'd off the Istind
again? Nay, is it not infinitely of more Worth to save so-
E 6. m.;ny .
p a ty Souls, than my Life is, or the Life of twenty mere
of the jame Vrofession? Xes, Sir, says he, I would give
Christ and the blejfed Virgin Thanks all my Days, if I could
it made the least happy Instrument of saving the Souls of
these poor Men, though I was never to set my Toot off this
Island, or set my native Country any more: But since you
-will honour me, says he, with pitting me into this Work,
for which I will pray for you -all the Days of my Life?
I have one humble Petition to you, said he, besides.- What
is that'? said I. Why, fjys he, it is, that you will leave
your Man Friday with me, to be my Interpreter to them, and-
to astist me; for without fame Help I cannot speak to them?
or they to me.
I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday, because
I could not think of parting with him, and that for many
Reasons; he had been the Companion of my Travels; he
was not only saithful to me, but sincerely affectionate to
the last degree; and I had refolv'd to do something con-
siderable for him, if he out-liv'd me, as it was probable he
would: Then I knew that, as I had bred Friday up to be
a Protestant, it would quite confound him to bring him
to embrace another Profession; and he would never, while
his Eyes were open, believe that his old Master was an
Heretick, and would be damn'd; and this might in the
End ru;n the poor Fellow's Principles, and so turn him
back again to his first Idolatry.
However, a sudden Thought reliev'd me in this Strait,
and it was this; I told htm I could not say that I was
willing to part with Friday on any Account whatever;
though a Work that to him was of more Value than his
Life, ought to be to me of much more Value than the
keeping or p.irting with a Servant: But on the other hand,
I was perswaded that Friday would by no means consent
to part with me, and then to force him to it without tits
Consent, would be manifest Injustice; because I had pro-
rnis'd I would never put hint away, and he had promised
and engag'd to me that he would never leave me unless I
put him away.
H e seem'd very much concern'd at it, for he had no
rational Access to these poor People, feeing he did not
understand one Word of their Language, nor they one Word
of his. To remove this Difficulty, I told him, Friday's
Father had learn'd Spamjli, which I found he also understood,
and he should serve htm for an Interpreter; so he was
much
much better satisfied, and nothing coald perswade him But
he would stay to endeavour to convert them; but Provi-
dence gave another, and very happy Turn to all this.
I come back now to the first Part of his Objections;
When we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them all
together, and after some Account given them of what f
had done for them, niz.. what necesiary things I had pro-
vided for 'em, and how they were distributed, which they
were sensible of, and very thankful for; F began to talk to
them of the scandalous Life they led, and gave them a full
Account of the Notice the Clergyman had already taken
of it, and arguing how unchristian.and irreligious a Life it
was: I first ask'd them if they wercmarried Men or Batche-
lors? They soon explain'd their Condition to me, and
shew'd me that two of them were Widowers, and the other
three were single Men, or Batchelors: I ask'd them with
what Consciences they could take these Women and lie
with them, as they had done, call them their Wives, and
have so many Children by them, and not be marry'd law-
fully to them?
Th ey all gave me the Answer that I expected, viz.
that there was no body to marry them; that they agreed
before the Governor to keep them as their Wives; and
to keep them and own them as their Wives; and they
thought, as things stood with them, they were as legally
married as if they had been married by a Parson, and witbr
all the Formalities in the World.
I told them, that no doubt they were married in the
Sight of God, and were bouad in Conscience to keep them
as their Wives; but that the Laws of Men being otherwise,
they might pretend they were not married; and so desert
the poor Women and Children hereafter, and that their
Wives, being poor desolate Women, friendless and money-
less, would have no way to help themselves: I therefore
told them, that unless I was affur'd of their honest Intent,
I could do nothing for them; but would take care that
what I did Ihouki be for the Women and their Children
without them; and that unless they would give some
Assurances that they would marry the Women, I could not
think it was convenient they should continue together as
Man and Wife, for that it was both scandalous to Men,
and offensive to God, who they could not think would
bless them, if they went on thus.
s lie J
iti this went on as I expected, and they told me,
especially Will. Atkins, who scem'd now to speak for the
rest, that they lov'J.their Wives as well, ax if they had been
born in their own native Country, and would not leave them
upon any Account whatever; and they did verily believe
their Wives were as virtuous and as tnodest, and did to the
utmost of their Skill, as much for them and for their Children,
as any Women could possibly do, and they would not part with
them an any Account: And William Atkins for his own
Particular added, If any Man would take him away, and
offer to carry him home to England, and make him Captain
of the best Man of War in the Navy, he would not go with
him, if he might not carry his Wife and Children with him;
and if there was a Clergyman in the Shif, he would be mar-
ried to her now with all his Heart.
This was just as I would have it; the Priest was not
with me at that Moment, but was not sar off: So to try
him farther, I told him, I had a Clergyman with me, and
if he was sincere, I would have him married the next
Morning, and bad him consider of it, and talk with the rest;
he said, as for himself he need not consider of it at all, for
-he was very ready to do it, and was glad I had a Minister
(with me, aud he believ'd they would be all willing also: I
.then told him, That my Friend the Minister was a French-
.man, and could not speak English, but that I would af{ the
.Clerk between them: He never so much as ask'd me whe-
ther he was a Papist or Protestant, which was indeed what
I was afraid of: But, I say, they never inquir'd about it.
.So we parted, I went back to my Clergyman, and Will.
Atkins went in to talk with his Companions: I desir'd
the French Gentleman not to say any thing to them, till
the Business was thorough ripe, and I told him. what
Answer the Men had given me.
Before I went from their Quarter, they all came to
me, and told me, they had been considering what I had
said; that they were very glad to hear I had a Clergyman
in my Company, and they were very willing to give me
the Satisfaction I desir'd, and to be formally married as
soon as I pleas'd, for they were sar from desiring to part
with their Wives, and that they meant nothing but what
was very honest when they chose them. So I appointed
them to meet me the next Morning, and that in the mean
time they should let their Wives know the meaning of the
Marriage-Law; and that it was not only to prevent any
Scandal,
Scandal, but also to oblige them, that they should not.for-
sake them, whatever mjght happen.
The Women were eaiily made sensible of the Meaning
of the Thing, and were very well satisfied with it, as in-
deed they had Reason to be; so they sail'd not to attend
all together at my Apartment the next Rooming, where
I brought out my Clergyman; and tho' he had not on a
Minister's Gown, after the manner of England, or the Habit
of a Priest, after the manner of France j yet having a black
Vest something like a Cassock, with a Salh round it, he
did not look very unlike a Minister; and as for his Lan-
guage, I was'lnterpreter.
But the Seriousness of his Behaviour to them, and the
Scruples he made of marrying the Women, because they
were not baptiz'd, and profess'd Christians, gave them an
exceeding Reverence for his Person; and there was no need
after that to inquire whether he was a Clergyman or no.
Indeed I was afraid his Scruple would have been
carry'd so sar, as that he would not have marry'd them at
all; nay, notwithstanding all I was.able to say to him, he
resisted me, though modestly, yet very steadily, and at last
refused absolutely to marry them, unless he had first talk'd
with the Men and the Women too: And though at first I .
was a little backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with
a good Will, perceiving the Sincerity of his Design.
When he came to them, he let them know that I had
acquainted him with their Circumstances, and with the
present Design: That he was very willing to perform that
Part of his Function, and marry them as I had desir'd;
but that before he could do ir, he must take the Liberty
to talk with them: He told them, That in the Sight of all
indifferent Men, and in the Sense of the Laws of Society, they
had liv'd all this while in an open Adultery; and that it
was true, that nothing but the consenting to marry, or effec-
tually separating them from one another now, could put an
End to it; but there was a Difficulty. in it too, with refpeel to
the Laws of Christian Matrimony, which he was not fully
satisfy'd about, viz. That of marrying one that is a profess'd
Christian, to a Savage, an Idolater, and a Heathen, ene
that is not baptized; and yet that he did not fee that there
was time left for it, to emleavour to persuade the Women to
be baptized, or to profess the Name of Christ, whom they had,
he doubted, heard nothing of, and without which they could
not be baptized.
Re told them, He doubted they were but indifferent
Christians themselves; that they had but little Knowledge of
God or his Ways; and therefore he could not expect that they
had said much to their Wives on that Head yet; iut that
unless they would promise him to use their Endeavours with
their Wives, to persuade them to become Christians, and
'would as well as they could instruct" them in the Knowledge
and Belief of God that made them, and to worship Jesus
Christ that redeem'd them, he could not marry them; for he
would have no hand in joining Christians with Savages; nor
was it consistent with the Principles of the Christian Religion;
and was indeed exprefly forbidden in God's Law.
They heard all this very attentively, and I deliver'd it
very saithfully to them, from his Mouth, as near his own
Words as I could, only sometimes adding something of
my own to convince them how just it was, and how I
was of his Mind ; and I always very saithfully distinguish^
between what I said from myself, and what were the
Clergyman's Words. They told me, it was very true,
what the Gentleman had laid, that they were but very
indifferent Christians themselves, and that they had never
talk'd to their Wives about Religion. Lord, Sir, siys-
WilL Atkins, how should we teach them Religion? Why,
we know nothing ourselves; and besides, Sir, said he,
should we go to talk to them of God, and Jesus Christ, and-
Heaven and Hell, 'twould be to make them laugh at us,
and ask us, What we belhve ourselves ? And if we should
tell them, we believe all the Things that we speak of to
the n, such as of good People going to Heaven, and wicked
People to the Devil, they would ask us, Where we intended
to go ourselves, who believe all this, and yet are fuck wicked
Fellows, as we indeed are? Why, Sir, said Will. 'tis enough to
give them a Surfeit of Religion at first Hearing: Polks must
have some Religion themselves, before they pretend to teach-
other People: Will. Atkins, said 1 to him; tho' I am afraid
what you say has too much Truth in it, yet can you not tell
your Wife that she's in the wrong? That there is a God and
a Religion better than her own; that her Gods are Idols, that
they can neither hear nor speak; that there is a' great Being
that made all Things, and that tan destroy all that he had
made; that he rewards the good, and punishes the bad; that
we are to be judg'd by him at last for all we do hire-: You
are not so ignorant, but even- Nature itself will teach you
Mt
that all this is true, and I am satisfyd you know it all fe
-be true, and believe it yourself.
That's true, Sir, faid Atkins; but with what Face east
I say any thing to my Wife of all this, when she will tell me
immediately it cannot be true?
Not true! faid I, What do you mean by that ? Why
Sir, said he, She will tell me it cannot be true, that this
God (I shall tell her as) can be just, or can punish or reward,
since I am not punish d, and sent to the Devil, that have
been such a wicked Creature as she knows I have been, even
to her, and to every body else; and that I should be fuf-
fer'd to live, that have been always acling so contrary to
what I must tell her is good, and to what I ought to have
done.
Why truly, Atkins, said I, I am afraid thou fpeak'st
too much Truth; and with that I let the Clergyman know
what Atkins had faid, for he was impatient to know: O!
faid the Priest; tell him there is one Thing will make him
the best Minister in the World to his Wife, and that is, Re-
pentance; for none teach B.epentance like true Penitents: He
?'ants nothing but to repent, and then he will be so much the
ttter qualify'd to instruct his Wife ; he will be then able to
tell her, that there is not only a God, and that he is the just
Rewarder of Good and Evil; but that he is a merciful Being,
and with infinite Goodness and Long-suffering forbears to
punish those that offend; waiting to be gracious, and willing
not the Death of a Sinner, but rather that he should return
and live \ that he oftentimes suffers wicked Men to go on along
time, and even reserves Damnation to the general Day of
Retribution; that it is a clear Evidence of God, and of *
future State, that righteous Men receive not their Reward, or
wicked Men their Punishment, till they come into another
World; and this will lead him to teach his Wift' the Doc-
tifrine of the Resurrection, ani of the last Judgment; let him
but repent for himself, he will be an excellent Preacher oft
Repentance to his Wife.
I repeated all this to Atkins, who look'd very serious
all the while, and who, we could easily perceive, was more
than ordinarily affected with it: When being eager, and
hardly suffering me to make an End, I knew all this, Ma-
ster, fays he, and a great deal more; but I han't the Im-
pudence to talk thus to my Wife; when God, and my
own Conscience knows, and my Wife will be an undeni-
able Evidence against me, that I have liv'd, as if I had
never-
never heard of a God, or a future State, or any thing about
it; and to talk of my repenting, alas! (And with that
he fetch'd a deep Sigh; and I could see, that Tears stood
in his Eyes ;) 'Tis past all that with me. Past it! atkins,
faid I, What dost thou mean by that? I know veil enough
what I mean, Sir, fays he, I mean 'tis too late, and that is
- too true.
I told my Clergyman word for word what he said;
the poor zealous Priest (I must call him so, for be his
Opinion what it will, he had certainly a most smgular
Affection for the Good of other Mens Souls, and it would
be hard to think he had not the like f»r his own;) I fay,
this zealous affectionate Man, could not refrain Tsars also:
But, recovering himself, he faid to me, ask him but one
Question, Is he easy that it is too lose, or is he troubled, and.
wishes it were not so I I put the Question fairly to Atkins,
and he answered with a great deal of Passion, How could
any Man be easy in a Condition that certainly must end in
eternal Destruction I That he was sar from being easy, but
that on'the contrary, he believ'd it would one time or other
ruin him.
What do you mean by that! siid I. Why, he said, he
believ'd he should, one time or other, cut his own Throat to
put an End to the Terror of it.
The Clergyman shook his Head with a great Con-
cern in his Face, when I told him all this; but turning
quick to me upon it, fays he, If that be his Cafe, you may
Assure him, it is not too late; Christ will give him Repentance;
but pray, fays he, explain this to him, That as no Man is
stiv'd but by Christ, and the Merit of his Pastion, procuring
divine Mercy for him, how can it be too late for any Man to
-receive Mercy} Does he think he is able to im beyond the
Power or Reach of divine Mercy? Pray tell him, There
- may be a Time when provok'd Mercy will no longer strive,
and when God may refuse to hear, but that 'tis never too late
for Men to ask Mercy; and we that are Christ's Servants are
.commanded to preach Mercy at all times, in the Name of
Jesus Christ, to all those that smcerely repent; so that 'tit
never too late to repent.
.1 told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great
Earnestness; but it fcero'd as if he turn'id off the Discourse
to the rest; for he faid to me, he would go and have some
Talk with his Wife; so he went out a while, and we talk'd
to the rest. I perceiv'd they were all stupidly ignorant as
to.
to Matters of Religion; much as I was when I went
rambling away from my Father; and yet that there were
none of them backward to hear what had been kid; and all
of them seriously promis'd that they would talk with their
Wives about it, and to do their Endeavour to persuade
them to turn Christians.
The Clergyman smil'd upon me, when I reported
what Answer they gave, but faid nothing a good while;
but, at Injji, making his Head, We that are Christ's Ser-
vants, lays he, can go no further than to exhort and in-
struct; and when Men comply, submit to the Reproof, and
promife what we ask, 'tis all we can do; we are bound to-
accept their good Words: But believe me, Sir, faid he, what-
ever you may have known of the life of that Man you call
William Atkins, I believe he is the only sincere Convert
among them; I take that Man to be a true Penitent; I won't
Jifpair of the rest, but that Man is perfeHly struck with the
Sense of his past Life ; and I doubt not, but when he comes to
talk Religion to his Wife, he will talk himself effectually into
it; for attempting to teach others, is sometimes the best way
of teaching ourselves: I knew a Man, added he, who hav-
ing nothing but a summary Notion of Religion himself, and
being wicked and profligate to the last degree in his Life, made
A thorough Reformation in himself.. by labouring to convert a
Jew; and if that poor Atkins begms but once to talk feriousty
offesus Christ to his Wife, my Life for it, he talks himself
into a thorough Convert, makes himself a Penitent: And who
knows what may follow I
Upon this Discourse however, and their promising,
as above, to endeavour to .perftiade their Wives to embrace
Christianity, he marry'd the other three Couple, but Will.
Atkins and his Wife were not yet come in: After this, my
.Clergyman, waiting a while, was curious to know where
Atkins was gone; and, turning to me, fays he, I intreat
you, Sir, let us walk cut of your Labyrinth here, and look; I
dare say, we shall find this poor Man somewhere or other
talking serioufly to his Wife, and teaching her already some-
thing of Religion. I began to be of the lame Mind; So we
went out together, and I carry'd him a Way which none
knew but myself, and where the Trees were so thick set,
as that it was not easy to see thro'the Thicket of Leaves, and
far harder to see in, than to see out; when coming to the
Edge of the Wood, I faw Atkins and his tawny Savage-
Wife sitting under the Shade of a fiusl), very eager in Dis-
course i
[I*1
course; I stopp'd'short, till my Clergyman'came up to mnerj
and then* having shew'd him where they were, we stood
and look'd very steadily at them a good while.
W e observ'd him very earnest with her, pointing up to
the Sun, and to every Quarter of the Heavens; then down
to the Earth, then out to the Sea, then to himself, then to
her, to the Woods, to the Trees: Now; says my Clergy-
man, you see my Words are made good, the Man freachts
ft her, mark him, now he is telling her, that our God has
made him, and her, and the Heavens. the Earth, the Sea, she
Woods, theTrees, 8cc. I Relieve he is, said T; immediately
. we perceiv'd Will. Atkins start up upon his Feet, sait (town
upon his Knees, and lift up both his Hands: We suppose he
said something, but we could not hear him, it was too sar
for that; he did not continue kneeling half a Minute, but
comes and sits down again by his Wife, and talks to her
again: We perceiv'd then the Woman very attentive, but
whether she said any thing or no, we could not tell; while
the poor Fellow was upon his Knees, I could see the Tears
run plentifully down my Clergyman's Cheeks, and I could
hardly forbear myself; but it was a great Affliction to us
both, that we were not near enough to hear any thing that
pass'd between them.
Well, however, we could come no nearer for fear of
disturbing them; so we resolv'd to see an End of this Piece
of still Conversation, and it spoke loud'- enoogh to us, with-
out the Help of Voice: He sat down again, as I' have
said, close by her, and talk'd again earnestly to her; and
two or three times we could see him embrace her passio-
nately; anothertime we saw him take out his Handkerchief,
and wipe her Eyes, and then kiss her again, with a kind of
Transport very unusual; and after several of these Things,
we saw him on a sudden jump up again, and lend her his
Hand to help her up, when immediately leading her by
the Hand a Step or two, they both kneel'd down together,
and continu'd so about two Minutes.
M y Friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud,
St. Paul, St. Paul! behold he frayeth; I was afraid Atkins
would hear him, therefore I intreated him to with-hold
himself a while, that we might see an End of the Scene,
which to me I must confess, was the most affecting, and
yet- the most agreeable that ever I saw in my Life: Well,
he strove with himself, and contain'd himself for a while,
but was in. such Raptures of Joy, to think that the poor
Heathen
I »?3
Heathen Woman was become a Christian, that he was
not able to contain himself; he wept several times, then
throwing up his Hands, and crossing his Breast, said over
several Things ejaculatory, and by way of giving God
Thanks for ib miraculous a Testimony of the Success of
our Endeavours; some he spoke softly, and I could not
well hear; others audibly, some in Latin, some in French;
then two or three times the Tears of Joy would interrupt
him, that he could not speak at all: But I begg'd, that he
would compose himself, and let us more narrowly and
fully observe what was before us, which he did for a
Time, and the Scene was not ended there yet; for, after
the poor Man and his Wife were risen again from their
Knees, we observ'd he stood talking still eagerly to her;
and we observ'd by her Motion, that she was greatly
affected with what he said, by her frequent lifting up her
Hands, laying her Hand to her Breast, and such other
Postures, as usually express the greatest Seriousness and
Attention: This continu'd about half a Quarter of an
Hour, and then they walk'd away too; so that we could
see no more of them in that Situation.
I took this Interval to talk with my Clergyman; and
first, I told him, / was glad to fee the Particulars we had
both been Witnesses to; that tho' I was hard enough of Belief
in such Cases, yet that I began to think it was all very sin-
Gere here, both in the Man and his Wife, however ignorant
they might both be; and I hop'd such a Beginning would have
0 y,2t more happy End; and who knows, said I, but these
two may in time, by Instruction and Example, work upon
seme ,of the others ? Some of them, said he, turning quick
upon me, Ay, upon all of them; depend upon it, if those
two Savages, for he has been but little better, as you relate
it, should embrace Jesus Christ, they will never leave till
they work upon all the rest; for true Religion is naturally
communicative, and he that is once made a Christian, will
never leave a Pagan behind him, if, he can help it: I
own'd, it was a most Christian Principle to think so, and a
Testimony- of a true Zeal, as well as a generous Heart in
him: but, my Friend, said I, will you give me leave to
start one Difficulty hern > I cannot tell how to objeti the least
thing against that affectionate Concern, which sou shew for
the turning the poor People from their Paganism to the
Christian P-eligion: But how does this comfort you, while
these feople are, in your Account, out of the Pale of the Ca-
.. tholick
tholick Church, without which, you believe there is n» Sal-
vation; so that you esteem these but Hereticks still, and for
other Reasons, as effectually loft as the Pagans themselves.
T o this he anlwcr'd with abundance of Candour and'
Christian Charity, thus: Sir, JE am a Catholick of the' Ro-
man Church, and a Priest of the Order of St. Benedict, and
I embrace all the Principles of the Roman Faith; but yet
if you will believe me, and this I do not speak in Compliment
to you, or in respect to my Circumstances, and your Civilities;
I say, nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who call your
selves Reform'd, without some Charity: I dare not say,
though I know it our Opinion in generals 1 say, I dare not
say, that you cannot be sav'd; will by no means limit the-
Mercy of Christ so far, as to think, that he cannot receive
you into the Bosom of his Church, in a manner to us unper-
ctivable, and which it is impossible for us to know; and I
hope you have the fame Charity for us; I pray daily for
your being all restord to Christ's Church, by whatsoever Me-
thods, he who is All-wife, is pleas'd to direct: In the mean-
time, sure, you will allow it to consist with me, as a Roman,
to distinguish sar between a Protestant and a Pagan; be-
tween one that calls on jesus Christ, though in a way which
I do not think is according to the true Faith; and a Savage,
a Barbarian, that knows no God, no Christ, no Redeemer at
all; and if you are not within the Pale of the Catholick
Church, we hope you are nearer being restor'd to it, than
those that know nothing at all of God or his Church: I Re-
joice therefore, when I fee this poor Man, who, you fay, has
been a Profligate, and almost a Murderer, kneel down and-
pray to Jesiis Christ, as we suppose he did, tho' not fully
enlighten'd; believing that God, from whom every such Work
proceeds, will sensibly touch his Heart, and bring him to the
further Knowledge of the Truth in his own Time; and if God
shall influence this poor Man to convert and instruct the ig-
norant Savage his Wife, I can never believe that he shall
be cast away himself, and have I not Reason then to re-
joice, the nearer any are brought to the Knowledge of Christ,
though they may not be brought quite home into the Bosom
of the Catholick Church, just at the time when I may desire
it; leaving it to the Coldness of Christ to perfect his Work
in his own Time, and his own Way. Certainly I would re-
jeice, if all the Savages in America were brought, like this
poor Woman, to pray to God, tho' they were to be all Prote-
stants
stints at first, rather than they should continue Pagans and
Heathens; firmly believing, that he who had bestow'd that
first Light us on them, would further illuminate them with a
Beam of his heavenly Grace, and bring them into the Sale
of bis Church when he should fee good.
I w a s astonished at the Sincerity and Temper of this
truly pious Papist, as much as I was oppress'd by the
Power of his Reasoning; and it presently occur'd to my
Thoughts, that if such a Temper was universal, we might
be all Catholick Christians, whatever Church or particular
Profession we join'd to; or join'd in; that a Spirit of Cha-
rity would soon work us all up into right Principles; and,
in a word, as he thought that the like Charity would
make us all Catholicks, so I told him, I believ'd, had all
the Members of his Church the like Moderation, they would
soon be all Protestants, and there we left that Part, for we
never disputed at all.
However, I talk'd to him another way, and taking
him by the Hand, My Friend, said I, I wish all the Clergy
.of the Roman Church were bless'd with such Moderation, and
an equal Share yiur Charity; lam intirely of your Opinion;
tut I must tell you, that if you should preach such Doctrine in
Spain, or Italy, they would put you into the Inquisition.
It may be so, said he, / know not what they might do
in Spain. and Italy, but I will not fay, they would be the
better Christians for that Severity, for 1 am sure there is no
Heresy in too much Charity.
Well, as Will. Atkins and his Wife were gone, our
Business there was over: So we went back our own Way;
and when we came back, we found them waiting to be
call'd in: Observing this, I ask'd my Cergyman, if we
should discover to him, that we haj seen him under the
Bush, or no; and it was his Opinion we should not; but
that we should talk to him first, and hear what he would
say to us; so we cail'd him in alone, no body being in
the Place but ourselves, and I began with him thus:
Will. Atkins, said I, prithee what Education had you?
What was your Father?
W. Ai. A better Man than ever I shall be. Sir, my Fa-
ther was a Clergyman.
R. C. What Education did he give you?
W. A. He would have taught me well, Sir; but I de-
spis'd all Education, Instruction, or Correction, like a Beast
as I was. ~
E. C,
s 120 1
R. C. It's true, Sohmon fays, He that despifes Reproof is
brutish.
W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutish, indeed, I murder'd my
Father; for God's Sake, Sir, talk no more about that, Sir,
I murder'd my poor Father. .*
Priest. Ha! a Murderer! *
* Here the Priesi started (for I interpreted every
Word as he spoke it) and look'd pale; it seems he
believ'd that Will. had really kill'd his own Father.
R. C No, do, Sir, I do not understand him so; Will.
Atkins, explain yourself, you did not kill your Father,
did you, with you own Hands?
W. A. No, Sir, I did not cut his Throat; but I cut the
Thread of all his Comforts, and shorten'd his Days; I
broke his Heart by the most ungrateful unnatural Return,
for the most tender affectionate Treatment that ever Fa-
ther gave, or Child could receive.
R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your Father, to
extort this Confession; I pray God give you Repentance
for it, and forgive you that, and all your other Sins; but
I ask'd you, because I see, that though you have not much
Learning, yet you are not so ignorant as some are, in
Things that are good; that you have known more of
Religion a great deal than you practis'd.
W. A. Tho' you, Sir, did not extort the Confession that
I make about my Father, Conscience does; and whenever
we come to look back upon our Lives, the Sms against
our indulgent Parents are certainly the first that touches
us; the Wounds they make, lie deepest, and the Weight
they leave will lie heaviest upon the Mind, of all the Sins
we can commit.
R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, At-
kins, I cannot bear it.
W. A, You bear it, Master, I dare fay you know nothing
of it.
R. C. Yes, Atkins, every Shore, every Hill, nay, I may
fay, every Tree in this Island is witness to the Anguish of
my Soul, for my Ingratitude and base Ufage of a good
tender Father; a Father much like yours, by your De-
scription; and I murder'd my Father as well as you, Will.
I
Atkins; but think, for all that, my Repentance is flwrt of
yours too * by a great deal.
* I would have said more if I could have restrain'd
my Passions; but I thought this poor Man's Repen-
tance was so much fincerer than mine, that I WAS
going to leave off the Discourse and retire, for I was
JurprizJd with what he said; and thought, that in-
stead of my going about to teach and instruct him, the
Man was made a Teacher and Instructor to me, in a
most surprizing and unexpected manner.
1 laid all this before the young Clergyman, who was
greatly affected with it, and said to me, Did I not say,
Sir, that when this Man was < onverted, he would preach to
us all? I tell you, Sir, if this one Man be made a true Peni-
tent, here will be no need of me, he will make Christians of
all in the Istand. But having a little compos'd myself, I
renew'd my Discourse with Will. Atkins.
But Will. said I, How comes the Sense of this Matter t»
touch you just now?
W. A. Sir, you have set me about a Work that has
strmck a Dart through my very Soul; I have been talking
about God and Religion to my Wife, in order, as you
directed me, to make a Christian of her, and she has
preach'd such a Sermon to me, as I shall never forget while
I live.
R. C. No, no, it is not your Wife has preach'd to you;
but when you were moving religious Arguments to her,
Conscience has flung them back upon you.
W. A. Ay, Sir, with such a Force as is not to be re-
sisted.
R. C. Pray, Will. let us know what pass'd between
you and your Wife; for I know something of it al-
ready.
W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full Account of
It; I am too full to hold it, and yet have no Tongue to ex-
press it; but let her have said what she will, and tho' I
cannot give you an Account of it, this I can tell you of it,
that I resolve to amend and reform my Life.
R. C. But tell us some of it. How did you begin, Will.
For this has been an extraordinary Cafe, that's certain;
she has preach'd a Sermon, indeed, if she has wrought
this upon you.
F W. A.
{ IZZ ]
W. A. Why, I first told her the Nature of our Lav/s
-about Marriage, and what the Reasons were, that Men
and Women were oblig'd to enter into such' Compacts, as
it was neither in the Power of one or other to break;
that otherwise Order and Justice could not be maintain'd,
and Men would run from their Wives, and abandon their
Children, mix confusedly with one another, and neither
"Families be kept intire, or Inheritances be settled by legal
"Descent.
R. C. You talk like a Civilian, Will. Could you make
lier understand what you meant by Inheritance and Fami-
lies? They know no such thing among the Savages, but
i marry any how, without any Regard to Relation, Consan-
guinity, or Family; Brother and Sister; nay, as I have
been told, even the Father and Daughter, and the Son and
the Mother.
W. A. I believe, Sir, you are misinforms, and my Wife
assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it; perhaps,
-for any sarther Relations, they may not be so exact as we
are; but she tells me they never touch one another in the
near Relations you speak of.
R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told
-her?
W. A. She said, she lik'd it very well, and it was much
better than in her Country.
R. C. But did you tell her what Marriage was?
'W. A. Ay, ay, there began all our Dialogue. I ask'd
her, if she would be marry'd to me our way 1 She ask'd
'me, what way that was? 1 told her, Marriage was ap-
pointed of God; and here we had a strange Talk together,
indeed, as ever.Man and Wife had, I believe.
N. ft. This Dialogue between W. Atkins and his Wife,
as I took it down in Writing, just after he told it me,
was as follows:
Wife. Appointed by your God! why have you a God in
your Country?
'W. A. Yes, my Dear, God is in every Country. -
Wife. No your God in my Country* my Country have
the great old Benamuckee God.
W. A. Child I am very unfit to shew you who God is;
God is in Heaven, and made the Heaven and the Earth, the
Æea, and all that in them is.
Wife:
Wist. No makee it Earth; no you God makee de
Earth, no make my Country.*
* W. A. Lctug^d a little at her Exprejfon os God not
making her Country.
Wife. No laugh: Why laugh me? This no thing to
laugh. f
f He was justly reprov'd by his Wife, for stie was more
serious than he at first.
W. A. That's true indeed, I will not laugh any more,
my Dear.
Wife. Why you say, you God make all?
W. A. Yes, Child, our God made the whole Work!,
and you, and me, and aH Things; for he is the only true
God, there is no God but he, he lives for ever in Hea-
ven.
Wife. Why you no tell me long ago?
W. A. That's true indeed; but I have been a wicked
Wretch, and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with
any thing before, but have lived without God in the World
myself.
Wife. What have you de great God in you Country, yo«
no kno' him? No say O to him? No do good thing for
him? That no impossible!
W. A. It is too true though, for all that, we live as if
there was no God in Heaven, or that he had no Power on
Earth.
Wife. But why God let you do so? Why he no niakee
you good live?
W. A. It is all our own Fault.
Wise. But you say me, he is great, much great, have
much great Power; can makee kill when he will; why he
no makee kill when you no serve him? No say O to
him? No be good Mans?
W. A. That is true; he might strike me dead, and I
ought to expect it, for I have been a wicked Wretch, that
is true, but God is merciful, and does not deal with us
as we deserve.
Wife. But then, do not you tell God thankee for that
too?
F z W. A
W. A. No, indeed, I have not thank'd God For his Mercy,
any more than I have fear'd God for his Power.
Wife. Then you God no God; me no think, believe, he
be such one, great much Power, strong; no makee kill you
tho' you makee him much angry?
W. A. What? will my wicked Life hinder you from
believing in God! What a dreadful Creature am I! And
what a lad Truth is it, that the horrid Lives of Christians
hln.ier the Conversions of Heathens?
Wife. How me tink you have great much God f up there,
and yet no do well, no do good ting? Can he tell? Sure
he no tell what you do?
f She points up to Heaven.
W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and fees all Things; he
hears us speak, fees what we do, knows what we think,
tho' we do not speak.
Wift. What! he no hear you swear, curse, speak the
great Damn?
IV. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all.
Wife. Where be then the muchee great Power strong?
W. A. He is merciful, that's all we can fay for it; and
this proves him to be the true God; he is God and not
Mm j and therefore we are not consumed.*
* Here Will. Atkins, told us, he was struck with Horror,
10 think how he could tell his Wife so clearly, that
Cicrl fees. and hears, and knows the secret Thoughts
cf the Heart, and all that we do; and yet that he
had dir'd to do all the vile Things he had done.
Wife. Merciful! What you call dat?
W. A He is our Father and Maker, and he pities and
spares us.
Wife. So then he never makee kill, never angry when
you do wicked; then he no good himself, or no great
able.
W. A.. Yes, yes, my Dear, he is infinitely good, and
infinitely grc.it, and able to punish too; and sometimes,
to shew his justice and Vengeance, he lets fly his Anger
to destroy Sinners, and make Examples; many are cut off
in their Sins. .
Wife.
Wise. But no makee kill you yet, then he tell you may
be, that he no make you kill, so you make de Bargain
with him, you do bad Thing, he no be angry at you,
when he be angry at other MensL
W. A. No indeed, my Sins are all Presumptions upon
his Goodness; and he would be infinitely just, it he de-
stroyed me, as he has done other Men.
Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead! What
you lay to him for that? you no tell him Tankee for all that
too!
W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful Dog, that's true.
Wife. Why he no makee you much good better ? You
say he makee you.
W. A. He made me as he made all the World; 'tis I
have deform'd myself, and abus'd his Goodness, and have
made myself an abominable Wretch.
Wife. I wish you makee God know me, I no makee him
angry, I no do bad wicked thing.
Here Will. Atkins said his Heart funk within him, to
hear a poor untaught Creature desire to be taught t»
know God, and he such a wicked Wretch, that he
could not say one Word to her about God, but what
the Reproach os his own Carriage would make most
irrational to her to believe; nay, that already (lit
could not believe in God, because he that was so wicked
was not destroyed.
W. A My Dear, you mean, you wish I could teach you
to know God, not God to know you; for he knows you
already, and every Thought in your Heart.
Wife. Why then he know what I say to you now; he
know me wish to know him; how shall me know who
makee me?
W. A. Poor Creature, he must teach thee, 1 cannot teach
thee; I'll pray to him to teach thee to know him, and to
forgive me, that I am unwor,hy to teach thee.
'The poor Fellow was in such an Agony at her desiring
him to make her know God, and her wisliing to know
him, that, he said. he sell down on his Knees before
her, and prc.y'd to God, to enlighten her Mind with
the saving Knowledge of Jesus Christ, and to pardon
his Sins, . and accept of his being the unworthy Instru-
ment of instructing her in the Principles of Religion;
F j after
after which he sat down by her again, and their
Dialo&ui went on. N. B. This was the Time
when we saw him kneel down, and lift up his
Hands.
Wife. What you put down the Knee for? What you
hold up the Hand for? What you say? Who you speak
to? What is that?
W. A. My Dear, I bow my Knees in Token of my Sub-
mission to him that made me; I said O to him, as you
call it, and as you say, your old Men do to their Idol Be-
namuckee ; that is, I pray'd to him.
Wise. What you say O to him for?
W. A. I pray'd to him to open your Eyes, and your
Understanding, that you may know him, and be accepted
by him.
Wse. Can he do that too?
W. A. Yes, he can, he can do all Things.
Wife. But no he hear what you say?
W. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him, and promisM to
hear us.
Wife. Bid you pray ? When he bid you? How he bid
you? What! You hear him speak?
W.A. No, we do not hear him speak, but he has re-
vealed himself many Ways to us.
Here he was at * great Loss to make her understand,
that God had reveai'd himself to us by his Word, and
what his Word was: But at last he told it her thus.
W. A. God has spoken to some good Men in former
Days, even from Heaven, by plain Words; and God has
iuipir'd good Men by his Spirit; and they have written
all his Laws down in a Book.
Wise. Me no understand that, where is Book?
XV. A. Alas! my poor Creature, I have not this Book;
but 1 hope I shall one Time or other get it for you to
read it.
Here he embraced her with great Affeiiion; but with
inexpressible Grief that he had not a Bible.
W. A. But how you makee me know, that God teachee
them to write that Book?
W. A.
TV. A. By the same Rule that we know him to be Gbd^
Wife. What Rule, what Way you know?
W. A. Because he teaches and commands nothing but.
what is good, righteous, and holy; and tends to make
us perfectly good, as well as perfectly happy; and be-
cause he forbids and commands us to avoid all that is
wicked, that is evil in it self, or evil in. its Consequen-
ces.
Wise. That me would understand, that me sain see; if
he teachee all good Thing, forbid all wicked Thing; he
reward all good Thing, punish all wicked Thing, he make
all Thing, he give all Thing, he hear me when I say O
to him, as you go do just now ; he makec me good, if
I wish be goods he spare me, no makee kill me, when
1 no be good; all this you say he do; yes he be great
God; me take, think, believe him be great God; me say
O to him too with you, my Dear.-
Here the poor Man said, he could forbear no longer;
but ra sing her up, made her kneel by him, and he pray'd
to God aloud, to instruct her in the Knowledge of himself
by his Spirit, and that by some good Providence, if pos-
sible, she might some time or other come to have a Bible,
that she might read the Word of God, and be taught by it
to know him..
This was the Time that we saw him lift her up by the
Hand, and saw him kneel down hy her, as above.
They had several other Discourses, it seems, after this,
too long to set down here; and particularly she made him.
promise, that since he confess'd his own Life had been a
wicked abominable Course of Provocation against God,
that he would reform it, and not make God angry any.
more, lest he . should make him deaJ, as she call'd it, and
then she should be left alone; and never be taught to know
this God better; and left he should be miserable, as he had.
told her, wicked Men should be after Death.
This was a strange Account, and very affecting to us.
both, but particularly to the young Clergyman; he was in-
deed wonderfully surpriz'd with it, but under the greatest
Affliction imaginable, that he could not talk to her, that he
could not speak Englifi to make her understand him; and
as she spoke but very broken English, he could not under-
stand her. However he turn'd himself to me, and told
F 4 roe,
me, t hat he believ'd there must be more to do with this
Woman than to marry her: I did not understand him at
first, but at length he explain'd himself, viz. that she ought
to be baptized.
I agreed with him in that Part readily, and was for
going about it presently: No, no, hold Sir, said he, tho' I
would have her be baptix'd by all Means, yet I must ob-
serve, that Will. Atk'ms, her Husband, has indeed brought
her in a wonderful Manner to be willing to embrace a re-
ligious Life, and has given her just Ideas of the Being of a
God, of his Power, Justice, Mercy; yet 1 desire to know
of him, if he had said any thing to her of Jesus Christ, and
of the Salvation of Sinners, of the Nature of Faith in him,
and Redemption by him ; of the Holy Spirit, the Resur-
rection, the last Judgment, and a future State.
I c a l l'd Will. Atkins again, and ask'd him; but the
poor Fellow fell immediately into Tears, and told us, he
had said something to her of all those things, but that he
was himself so wicked a Creature, and his own Conscience
so reproach'd him with his horrid ungodly Life, that he
trembled at the Apprehensions, that her Knowledge of
him should Jessen the Attention she should give to those
Things, and make her rather contemn Religion, than re-
ceive it: But he was aflur'd, he said, that her Mind was
ib dispos'd to receive due Impressions of all those Things,
that if I would but discourse with her, she would make it
appear to my Satissaction, that my Labour would not be
lost upon her.
Accordingly I call'd her in, and placing myself
as Interpreter between my religious Priest and the Woman,
I intreatedhim to begin with her; but sure such a Sermon
was never preach'd by a Popish Priest in these latter Ages
of the World; and, as I told him, I thought he had all the
Zeal, all the Knowledge, all the Sincerity of a Christian,
without the Errors of a Roman Cutholick; and that 1 took
him to be such a Clergyman, as the Reman Bishops were,
before the Church ot Rome assumed spiritual Sovereignty
over the Consciences of Men.
I n a Word, he brought the poor Woman to embrace
the Knowledge of Christ, and of Redemption by him, not
with Wonder and Astonishment only, as she did the first
Norions of a God, but with Joy and Faith, with an Af-
fection and a surprizing Degree "of Understanding, scarce to
be
s m%
be imaging, much less to be express'd; and, at her own Re-
quest, she was baptiz'd.
When he was preparing to baptize her, I intreated
him, that he would perform that Office with some Caution,
that the Man might not perceive he was of the Roman
Church, if possible; because of other ill Consequences
which might attend a Difference among us in that very Re-
ligion, which we were instructing the other in: He told
me, that as he had no consecrated Chapel, no proper
things for the Office, I should fee he would do it in a
Manner, that I should not know by it, that he was a Ro-
man Catholick myself, if I had not known it before: And
so he did; for saying only some Words over to himself in
Latin, which I could not understand, he pour'd a whole
Dish full of Water upon the Woman's Held, pronouncing
in French very loud, M A R Y, which was the Name her
Husband desir'd me to give her; for I was her God-sather,
1 baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of th' Son,
and of the Holy Ghost; so that none could know any thing
by it, what Religion he was of: He gave the Benedict on
afterwards in Latin; but either Will. Atkins did not know
bat it was in French, or else did not take Notice of it at
that Time.
A s soon as this was over, he marry'd them ,- and after
the Marriage was over, he turned himself to Will. Atkins,
and in a very affectionate Mann.r exhorted him, no- only
to persevere in that good Disposition he was in, but to sup-
port the Convictions that were upon him by a Resolution
to reform bis Life; told him, it was in vain to say he re-
pented, if he did not forsake his.Crimes; represented to
him, how God had honour'd him with being the Inftumcnt
of bringing his Wife to the Knowledge of the Christian
Religion, and that he should be careful he did not disho-
nour the Grace ot God, and that if he did, he would see the
Heathen a better Christian than himself; the Savage con-
verted, and the Instrument cast away.
H e said a great many good things to them both, an.l
then recommended them in a few Words to God's Good-
ness, gave them the Benediction again, I repeating every
thing to them in F.nglist>, and thus ended the Ceremony:
I think it was the most pleasant agreeable Day to me that
ever I pass'd in my whole Life.
But my Clergyman had not done yet; his Thoughts
hung continually upon the Conversion of the 37 Savagr*.
F f and
and sain he would have stay'd upon the Island to have
undertaken it; but I convine'd him, First, that his Under-
taking was impracticable in itself; and idly, that perhaps
I would put it inio a Way of being done, in his Absence,
to his Satissaction; of which, by and by.
Having thus brought the Afsair of the Island to 3
narrow Compass, I was preparing to go on board the Ship,
when the young Man who 1 had taken out of the samish'd
Ship's Company came to me, and told me, he understood
I had a Clergyman with me, and that I had caus'd the
Englishmen to be marry'd to the Savages, whom they calPd
Wives; that he had a Match too, which he desir'd might
be finished before I went, between two Christians, which
he hoped would not be disagreeable to me.
I knew this must be the young Woman who was his
Mother's Servant, for there was no other Christian Woman
on the Island; so I began to persuade him not to do any
thing ot that kind rashly, or because he found himself in
this solitary Circumstance: I represented, that he had some
considerable Substance in the World, and good Friends, as
I understood by myself, and by his Maid also; that the
Maid was not only poor, and a Servant, but was unequal
to him, slie being 16 or 27 Years old, and he not above
17 or 18; that he might very probably, with my Assi-
ltance, make a Remove from this Wildernes, and come
into his own Country again, and that then it would be as
thousand to one but he would repent his Choice; and the
Dislike of that Circumstance might be disadvantageous to
r>oth: I was going to say more, but he interrupted me,
smiling, and toid me, with a great deal of Modesty, that I
mistook in mv Guesses, that he had nothing of that Kind
in his Thoughts, his present Circumstance being melan-
choly and disconsolate enough; and he was very glad to hear
that I had Thoughts of putting them in a Way to fee their
own Country again, and that nothing should have put him
upon staying there, but that the Voyage I was going was
ib exceeding long and hazardous, and would carry him quite
out of the Reach of all his Friends; that he had nothing to
desire of me, but that I would settle him in some little Pro-
perty in the Island where he was, give him a Servant or
two, and some few Necessaries, and he would settle himself
here like a Painter, waiting the good time when, if ever
I reyirn'd to England, I would redeem him, and hop'd I
would not be unroiniful of him when I came to England;
that
r
that he would give me some Letters to his Friends in Lon-
don, to let them know how good I had been to him, and
in what Part of the World, and what Circumstance I had
left him in; that he promised me, that whenever I redeem'd
him, the Plantation and all the Improvements he had made
upon it, let the Value be what jt would, should be wholly
mine.
H 1 s Discourse was very prettily delivered, considering
his Y6uth, and was the more agreeable to me, because
he told me positively the Match was not for himself: I I
gave him all possible Assurances, that, it I liv'd to come
lafe to England, I would deliver his Letters, and do his
Business effectually, and that he might depend I would
never forget the Circumstance I had left him in; but. still
I was impatient to know, who was the Person to be mar-
ried, upon which he told me, it was my JackofallTrailes, .
and his Maid Susan.
I was most agreeably surpriz'd, when he nam'd the ..
Match, for indeed I had thought it very suitable. The Cha-
racter of that Man I have given already; and as for the .
Maid, slie was a very honest, modest, sober and. religious
young Woman, had a very good Share of Serise, was
agreeable enough in her Person, spoke very handsomely and .
to the Purpose; always with Decency and good Manner?;
and riot backward to speak when any thing requir'd it,
or impertinently forward to speak when it was not her Bu-
siness ; very handy and housewifely in any thing that was -;
before her ; an excellent Manager, and fit indeed to have
been Governess to the whole Island; she knew very well i
how to behave herself to all kind cf Folks she had about
her, and to better, if she had found any there. ..
The Mitch being proposed in this Manner, we mar-
ried them the fame Day, and as I was Father at the Altar,
as I may fay, and gave her away, so I gave her a Po-
tion; for 1 appointed her and her Husband a handsome
large Space of Ground for their Plantation; and indeed
this Match, and the Proposal the young Gentleman:
made to me, to give him a small Property in the
Island, put me upon parcelling it out among them, that
they might not quarrel afterwards about their Sitira- -
tion.
This Sharing out the Land to them, I left to Wilt.
Athiiu, who indeed was now grown a most iober. grave.
managing Fellow; perfectly reformed, exceeding pious
and religious; and as far as I may le allowed to speak po-
sitively in such a Case, I verily believe, was a true sincere
Penitent.
H e divided Things so justly, and so much to every one's
Satisfaction. that they only desired one general Writing
under my Hand for the Whole, which I caused to be
drawn up, and signed and sealed to them, setting out the
Bounds and Situation of every Man's Piantation, and testi-
fying, that 1 gave them thereby severally a Right to the
whole Poslession and Inheritance of the respective Planta-
tions or Farms, with their Improvements, to them and
their Heirs, reserving all the rest of the I/land as my own
Property, and a certain Rent for every particular Plantation
filler eleven Years, if I, or any one from me, or in my
Name, came to demand it, producing an attested Copy of
the same Writing.
As to the Government and Laws among them, I told
them I was not capable of giving them better Rules, than
they were able to give themselves; only made them pro-
miso me to live in Love and good Neighbourhood with
one another; and so I prepar'd to leave them.
One Thing I must not omit, and this is, that being
now settled in a Kind of Common-wealth among them-
lelves, and having much Business in Hand, it was but odd
to have seven and thirty Indians live in a Ncok of the
Island, independent, and indeed unemployed ; for except-
ing the providing themselves Food, which they had Dif-
ficulty enough in too, sometimes, they had no Manner of
Business or Proptr y to manage: I propos'd therefore to
the Governor Spaniard, that he should go to them with
Friday's Father, and propose to them to remove, and
cither plant for themselves, or take them into their several
Families as Servants to be maintained for their Labour, but
without being absolute Slaves; for I- would not admit
them to make them Slaves by Force, by any Means, be-
cause they had their Liberty given by Capitulation, and as
it were Articles of Surrender, which they ought not to
br;ak.
They most willingly embraced the Proposal,and came
all very chearful along with him; so we allotted them
Land, and Plantations, which three or four accepted of,
but all the rest chose to be employ'd as Servants in the se-
veral. Families we had settled; aud thus my Colony was
I?
in a Manner settled, as follows : The Spaniards possessed
my original Habitation, which was the capital City, and
extended their Plantations all along the Side of the-Brook,
which made the Creek that 1 have so often describ'd, as
far as my Bower; and as they increases their Culture,
it went always Eastward ; the English liv'd in the
North-East Part, where Will. Atkins and his Comrades be-
gan, and came on Southward, and South-west, towards
the back Part of the Spaniards, and every Plantation had.
a great Addition of Land to take in, if they found Occa-
sion; So that they need not jostle one another for want of
Room.
All the West-End of the Island was left uninhabited,
that if any of the Savages should come on Shore there,
only for their usual customary Barbarities, they might
come and go; if they disturbed no Body, no Body would
disturb them; and no doubt but they were often ashore,
and went away again ; for I never heard that the Planters
were ever attack'd or disturb'd any more.
I t now came into my Thoughts, that 1 had hinted to my
Friend the Clergyman, that the Work of converting the
Savages might perhaps be set on foot in his Absence, to
his Satissaction}'and I told him, that now I thought it
was put in a sair Way ; for the Savages being thus divided
among the Christians, if they would but every one of
them do their Part with those which came under their
Hands, I hoped it might have a very good Effect.
H e agreed presently in that, if, said he, they will do
their Part; but how, says he, shall we obtain that of them?
I told him, we could cail them all together, and leave it
in Charge with them, or go to them one by one, which
he thought best, so we divided it; he to speak to the Spa-
niards, who were all Papists, and I to the English, who
were all Protestants; and we recommended it earnestly to
them, and made them promise, that they never would
make any Distinction ot Papist or Pretestant, in their ex-
horting the Savages to turn Christians; but teach them
the general Knowledge of the true God, and of their Savi-
our Jesus Christ, and they likewise promised us, that they
would never have any Differences or Disputes one with
another, about Religion.
When I came to W. Atkins's House, (I may call it so,
for luchaHouseor such a Piece of Basket Work, I believe,
was not standing in the World again!) 1 say, when I came
thither
thither, I found the young Woman I have mentioned above,'
and W. Atkins's Wife, were become Intimates; and this
prudent religious young Woman, had perfected the Work
W. Atkins had begun; and though it was not above four
Days after after-what I have related, yet the new baptized
Savage Woman was made such a Christian, as I have seldom
heard ot any like her, in all my Observation, or Conver-
sation in the World.
It came next into my Mind in the Morning before I
went to them, that among all the needful Things I had to
leave 'with them, 1 had not left a Bible, in which, I
sliew'd myself less considering for them, than my good
Friend the Widow was for me, when she sent me the
Cargo of i oo I. from Lisbon, where she pack'd up three
Bibles and a Prayer Book: However the good Woman's
Charity had a greater Extent than ever she imagin'd;
for they were reserv'd for the Comfort and Instruction
ot those, that made much better Use of them than 1 had
done.
I took one of the Bibles in my Pocket, and when
I came to William Atkins's Tent or House, and found the
young Woman, and Atkins's baptized Wife, had been
discoursing of Religion together; for William Atkins told
me, with a great deal of Joy: I ask'd if they were toge-
ther now, and he said, Yes ; so I went into the House,
and he with me, and we found them together very
earnest in Discourse; O Sir, says William Atkins, when
God has Sinners to reconcile to himself, and Aliens to bring
Home, he never wants a Messenger; my Wise has got a new
Instructor ; / knew I was unworthy, as I was uncafable of
that Work; that young Woman has been sent hither from
Heaven; she is enough to convert a whole Istand of Savages.
The young Woman blush'd, and rose up to go away, but
I desir'd her to sit still; I told her, she had a good
Work upon her Hands, and I hoped God would bless her
in it.
W e talk'd a little, and I did not perceive they had any
Book among them, though I did not ask; but I put my
Hand in my Pocket, and pull'd out my Bible; here, said
I to Atkins, I have brought you an Assistant that -perhaps you.
had not before; the Man was so confounded, that he was
not able to speak for some Time; but recovering himself,
he takes it with both his Hands, and turning to his Wife,
Here, my Dear, says he, did not I tell you, our God, tho' he
lives above, could hear what roe said? Here's the Book I
prayed for, when you and I kneel'd down under the Bush; now
God has heard us andsent it. When he had said so, the Man
fell into such Transports of a passionate Joy, that between
the Joy of having it, and giving God Thanks for it, the
Tears run down his Face like a Child that was crying.
The Woman was surpriz'd, and was like to have run
into a Mistake, that none of us were aware of; for she
firmly believ'd God had sent the Book upon her Husband's
Petition: It is true, that providentially it was so, and might
be taken so in a consequent Sense; but I believ'd, it would
have been no difficult Matter at that Time to have per-
suaded the poor Woman to to have believed, that an express
Messenger came from Heaven, on purpose to bring that
individual Book; but it was too serious a Matter, to suf-
fer any Delusion to take Place; so I turn'd to the young
Woman, and told her, We did not desire to impose upon the
new Convert, in her first, and more ignorant understand-
ing of Things; and begg'd her to explain to her, that God
may be very properly said to answer our Petitions, when
in the Course of his Providence, such Things are in a par-
ticular Manner brought to pass, a; we petition'd for; but
we do not expect Returns from Heaven in a miraculous and
particular Manner, and that it is our Mercy, that it is
not so.
This the young Woman did afterwards effectually;
so that there was, I assure you, no Priestcraft used here;
and I should have thought it one of the most unjustifiable
Frauds in the World, to have had it so; but the Surprise
of Joy upon Will. Atkins, is really not to be expressed;
and there, we may be sure, there was no Delusion: Sure
no Man was ever more thankful in the World for any
thing of its Kind, than he was for this Bible; and I be-
lieve, never any Man was glad of a Bible from a better
Principle; and though he had been a most profligate Crea-
ture, desperate, headstrong, outrageous, furious, and wicked
to a great Degree; yet this Man is a standing Rule to us all
for the well instructing Children, (viz.) that Parents should
never give over to teach and instruct, or ever despair ot
the Success of their Endeavours, let the Children be ever so
obstinate, refractory, or to Appearance insensible of In-
struction; for if ever God in his Providence touches the
Consciences of such, the Fo.ce of their Education returns
"".'" upon
upon them, and the early Instruction of Parents is not loft;
though it may have been many Years laid asleep; but some
time or other, they may find the Benefit of it.
Thus it was with this poor Man, however ignorant
he was, or divested of Religion and Christian Knowledge:
He found he had some to do with now more ignorant than
himself; and that the least Part of the Instruction of his
good Father, that could now come to his Mind, was of
Use to him.
Among the rest it occurr'd to him, he said, how his
Father us'd to insist much upon the inexpressible Value of
the Bible; the Privilege and Blessing of it to Nations, Fa-
milies, and Persons; but he never entertain'd the least No-
tion of the Worth of it, till now; when being to talk to
Heathens, Savages, and Barbarians, he wanted the Help of
the written Oracle for his Assistance.
The young Woman was very glad of it also for the
present Occasion, tho' she had one, and so had the Youth
on board our Ship among their Goods, which were not
yet brought on Shore: And now having said so many
Things of this young Woman, I cannot omit telling one
Story more of her and myself, which has something in it
very informing and remarkable.
I have related, to what Eitremity the poor young
Woman was reduced; how her Mistress was starv'd to
Death, and did die on board that unhappy Ship we met at
Sea; and how the whole Ship's Company being redue'd to
the last Extremity, the Gentlewoman and her Son, and
this Maid, were first hardly used, as to Provisions; and
at last totally neglected and starv'd; that is to say, brought
to the last Extremity of Hunger.
One Day being discoursing with her upon the Extre-
m'ties they susser'd, I ask'd her if she could describe by
what she had felt, what it was to starve, and how it ap-
pear'd? She told me, she believ'd she could; and she told
her Tale very distinctly thus:
First, Sir, said she, we had for some Bays sar'd ex-
ceeding hard, and fujfer'd very great Hunger; but now at
last, we were wholly without Food of any Kind, except Su-
gar, and a little Wine. and a little Water. The first Day,
after I had receiv'd no Food at all, I found myself towards
Evening, first empty and fickish at my Stomach; and nearer
Hight mightily inclin'd to yawning. and sleepy; I laid down
en a Couch in the great Cabin to sleep, and sept about three
Hours,
Konrs, and awak'd a little resresh'd, having taken a Glass
of Wine when 1 lay down; after being about three Hours
awake, it being about five o'clock in the Morning, I found
myself empty, and my Stomach fickish again, and laid down
again; but cculd not fleep at all, being very saint and
ill -, and thus I continued all the second Day with a strange
Variety, first hungry, then sick again, with Reaching: to
vomit i the second Night, being oblig'd to go to Bed again,
without any Food more than a Draught of fair Water; and _
being asteep, I dream'd I was at Barbados, and that the
Market was mightily stock'd with Provisions; that I bought
some for my Mistress, and went and din'J very heartily.
would have been after, or at a good Dinner; but when I
awak'd, Z was exceedingly funk in my Spirits to find my-
self in the Extremity of Famine: The last Glass of Wine we
had, I drank, and put Sugar in it, because, of its having
some Spirit to supply Nourishment; but there being no Sub-
stance in the Stomach for the digesting Office to work upon,
I found the only Effect of the Wine was, to raife difagree-
as they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk, for some
time.
The third Day in the Morning, after a Night of strange
and confus'd inconsistent Dreams; and rather dozing than
fleeping, I wak'd, ravenous and furious with Hunger; and
I question, had not my Understanding retum'd, and conquer'd
it i I say, I question whether, if I had been a Mother, and
had had a little Child with me, its Life would have been safe
or not.
This la fled about three Hours; during which Time I
was twice raging mad as any Creature in Bedlam, as my
young Master told me, and as he can now inform you.
I n one of these Fits of Lunacy or Distraction, whether
by the Motion of the Ship, or some Slip of my Foot, I know
not; I fell down, and struck my Face against the Corner of
a Palat Bed in which my Mistress lay; and with the
Blow, the Blood gufh'd out of my Nose; "and the Cabin-
Boy bringing me a little Bason, I sat down and bled into
it a great deal; and as the Blood ran from me, I came
to myself; and the Violence of the Flame, or the Fever
1 was in, abated, and so did the ravenous Part of the
Hunger.


Stomach, into the Head; and I lay,
Then
Then s grew sick, and reacb'd to vomit, but could''
not; for I had nothing in my Stomach to bring up: After
I had bled some Time, I swoon'd, and they all believ'd
I teas dead; but 1 came to my self soon after, and then -
had a mofi dreadful Pain in my Stomach, not to be-
described; not like the Cholick, but a gnatoing eager Pain
for Food; and towards Night it went off with a Kind of
earnest Wishing or Longing for Food ; something like as I
suppose, the longing os a Woman with Child: I took ano-
ther Draught os Water with Sugar in it, but my Sto-
mach loathed the Sugar, and brought it all up again;
then I took a Draught of Witter without Sugar, and that
stayd with me ; and laid me down upon the Bed, praying
mofi heartily, that it would please God to take me away;
and composmg my Mind in Hopes of it, I flumber'd a while,
and then waking, thought myself dying, being light with
Vapours from an empty Stomach, I recommended my Soul
to God, and earnestly wish'd that some Body would throw
me into the Sea,
All this while my Mistress lay by me, just as I
thought, expiring, but bore it with much more Patience
than I, and gave the last Bit of Bread she had left to
her Child, my young Master, who would not haze taken
it, but she obliged him to eat it; and I believe, it sav'd
- his Lifii.
Towards the Morning I flept again, and first, when
I wak'd, I fell into a violent Passion of Crying, and after
that had a second Fit of violent Hunger, so that I got up
ravenous, and in a most dreadful Condition; had my Mi-
stress been dead, as much as I loved her, lam certain, I fiould
have eaten a Piece of her Flesh, with as much Relish, and
as unconcerrid as ever I did the Flep of any Creature
appointed for Food, and once or twice I was going to bite
my own Arm : At last, I saw the Bason, in which was the
Bhod I had bled at my Nose the Day before.; I ran to it,
md swallow'd it with such Haste, and such a greedy Appe-
tite, as if I had wonder'd no Body had taken it before, and -
afraid it should be taken from me now.
Tao' after it was down, the Thoughts of it fill'd me
with Horror, yet it check'd the Fit of Hunger, and 1 drank
0 Draught of sair Water, and was compoi'd and refresh'd
for some Hours- aft er it ; This was the fourth Day, and thus
1 held it, till towards Night, when within the Compass of
three Hours, 1 had all these several Cicumstances over again,
... one-
one after another, (viz.) sick, steepy, eagerly hungry, tain in
the Stomach, then ravenous again, then sick again, then lu-
natick, then crying, then ravenous again, and so every (Quar-
ter of an Hourand my Strength wasted exceedingly ; At
Night I laid me do-ton, having no Comfort, but in the Hose
that I should die before Morning.
All this might I had no Sleep, but the Hunger was now
turn'd into a Difease; and I had a terrible Cholick and
Griping, Wind instead of Food, having found its Way into
the Bowels; and in this Condition I lay till Morning, when
I was surprit.'d a little with the Cries and Lamentations of
my young Master, who call'd out to - me, that his Mother
was dead: I lifted myself up a little, for I had not Strength
to rife, but found she was not dead, tho' she was able to give
very little Signs of Life.
I H AD then such Convulsions in my Stomach, for want
of some Sustenance, that I cannot describe them; with such
frequent Throws and Pangs of Appetite, that nothing but the
Tortures of Death can imitate; and this Condition I was in
when I heard the Seamen above cry out, A Sail, a Sail, and hal-
low and jump about, as if they were distracled.
I WAS not able to get off from the Bed, and my Mi/lrefs
much less; and my Master was so sick, that I thought he had
been expiring; so we could not open the Cabin Door, or get
any Account what it was that occasioned such a Combustion, nor
had we any Conversation with the Ship's Company for twa
Days; they having told us they had not a Mouthful of any
Thing to eat in the Ship; and they told us afterwards, they
thought we had been dead.
IT was this dreadful Condition we were in when you were
sent to save our Lives; and how you found us. Sir, you know
as well as I, and better too. . . <
This was her own Relation, and is such a distinct Ac-
count of starving to Death, as I confess I never met with,
and was exceeding entertaining to me; I am the rather
apt to believe it to be a true Account, because the Youth
give me an Account of a good Part of it, though I must
own, not sb distinct and so feelingly as his Maid; and the
rather, because it seems his Mother fed him at the Price
of her own Life: But the poor Maid, though her Constitu-
tion being stronger than that of her Mistress, who was in
Years, and a weakly Woman too, she might struggle
harder with it; I fay, the poor Maid might be supposed
to feel the Extremity something sooner than her Mistrefi,
who might be allowed to keep the last Bits something'
longer than she parted with any to relieve the Maid. No
question, as the Cafe is here related, if our Ship, or some
other, had not so providentially met them, a few Days
more would have end;d all their Lives, unless they had
prevented it by eating one another; and even that, as their
Case stood, would have ferv'd them but a little while, they
being j-oo Leagues from any Land; or any Possibility of
Relief other than in the miraculous Manner it happen'd:
But this is by the way; I return to my Disposition of
Things among the People.
And First, It is to observ'd here, That for many
Reasons I did not think fit to let them know any thing
of the Sloop I had fram'd, and which I thought or setting
up among them; for I found, at least at my first coming,
such Seeds of Divisions among them, that I saw it plain-
ly, had I set up the Sloop, and left it among them, they
would upon every light Disgust have separated,' and gone
away from one another, or perhaps have turn'd Pirates,
and so made the Island a Den of Thieves, instead of a
Plantation of sober and religious People, as I intended it
to be; nor did I leave the two Pieces of Brass Cannon that I
had onboard, or the twoQuarter-DeckGuns, that my Ne-
phew took extraordinary, for the same Reason: I thought
they had enough to qualify them for a Defensive War
against any that should invade them ; but I was not to set
them up for an offensive War, or to encourage them to
go abroad to attack others, which in the End Would only
bring Ruin and Destruction upon themselves, and all their
Undertakings: I reserved the Sloop therefore, and the
Guns, for their Service another way, as I shall observe in
its Place.
I have now done with the Island: I left them all in
good Circumstances, and in a flourishing Condition, and
went on board my Ship again the fifth Day of May,
having been five and twenty Days among them; and
as they were all resolv'd to stay upon the Island till I
came to remove them, I promised to send some further
Relief from the Brasils, if I could possibly find an Op-
portunity; and particularly I promised to send them some
Cattle, such as Sheep, Hogs and Cows: For as to the two
Cows and Calves, which I brought from England, we
had been obliged, by the Length of our Voyjge, to kill
them at Sea, Tor want of Haj to feed them.
The
1140
Th( ne« Day, giving them a Salute of five Guns at
Parting, we set Sail and arriv'd at the Bay of All-Saints,
in the Brafils, in about *i Days; meeting nothing re-
maikable in" our Passage, but this, That about three Days
after we fail'd, being becalm'd, and the Current setting
strong to the E. N. E. running, as it were, into a Bay or
Gulph on the Land Side, we were driven something out
ot our Course, and once or twice our Men cry'd, Land
to the Westward; but whether it was the Continent or
Islands, we could not tell by any Means.
But the third Day towards Evening, the Sea smooth, and
the Weather calm, we faw the Sea, at it were, covered to-
wards the Land with something very black, not being able
to discover what it was; but atter some time, our chief
Mate going up the main Shrowds a little Way, and look-
ing at them with a Perspective, cry'd out, it was an Ar-
my; I could not imagine what he meant by an Army, and
spoke a little hastily, calling the Fellow a Fool, or some
such Word : Nay, Sir, says he, don't be angry, for it is
an Army, and a Fleet too; for I believe there are a thou-
fand Canoes, and you may fee them paddle along, and they
are coming towards us too, apace, and full of Men.
I w a s a little surpriz'd then indeed, and so was my
Nephew the Captain, tor he had heard such terrible Sto-
ries of 'em in the Island, and having never been in those
Seas before, that he could not tell what to think of it, but
faid two or three times, we should all be devour'd, I
must confess, considering we were becalm'd, and the Cur-
rent set strong towards the Shore,. I lik'd it the worse:
However, I bad him not be afraid", but bring the Ship to
an Anchor, as soon as we came so near as to know that
we must engage them.
The Weather continued calm, and they came on apace
towards us; sol gave Order to come to an Anchor, and
turl all our Sails. As for the Savages, I told them they
had nothing to fear but Fire; and therefore they should
get their Boats out, and fasten 'em, one close by the Head,
and the other by the Stern, and man them both well, and
wait the Issue in that Posture: This I did, that the Men
in the Boats might be ready with Sheats and Buckets to
put out any Fire these Savages might endeavour to fix
upon the outside of the Ship.
In this Posture we lay by for them, and in a little
while they came up with us; but never was such a hor-
rid
f 142?
rid Sight seen by Christians: My Mite was much mista-
ken in his Calculation of their Number, I mean of a
thousand Canoes; the most we could make of them when
they came up, being about a hundred and six and twenty,
and a great many of them too; for some of them had six-
teen or seventeen Men in them, some more; and the least
six or seven.
When they came nearer to us, they seem'd to be struck
with Wonder and Astonishment, as at a Sight which they
had doubtless never seen before; nor could they at first,
as we afterwards understood, know what to make of us:
They came boldly up however very near to'us, and seem'd
to go about, to row round us; but we call'd to our Men
in the Boats, not to let them come too near them.
This very Order brought us to an Engagement with
them, without our designing it; for five or six of their
large Canoes came so near our Long-Boat, that our Men
beckon'd with their Hands to them to keep back, which
they understood very well, and went back; but at their
Retreat, about 500 Arrows came on board us from those
Boats; and one of our Men in the Long-boat was very
much wounded.
How even, I call'd to them not to fire by any means;
but we handed down some Deal Boards into the Boat,
and the Carpenter presently set up a Kind of a Fence like
waste Boards, to cover them from the Arrows of the Sa-
vages, if they should shoot again-
About half an Hour afterwards they came all up in
a Body a-stern of us, and pretty near, so near that we
could easily diseern whit they were, though we could
not tell their Design: I easily found they were'some of my
old Friends, the same Sort of Savages that I had been
used to engage with; and in a little time more they row'd
a little sarther out to Sea, till they came directly Broad-
side with us, and then rowed down strait upon us, till
they came so near that they could hear us speak: Upon
this I order'd all my Men to keep close, least they should
shoot any more Arrows, and make all our Guns ready;
but being so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday
go out upon the Deck, and call out aloud to them in his
Language, to know what they meant; which accordingly
he did; whether they understood him or not, that I knew
not: But as soon as he had call'd to them, six of them,
who were in the foremost or nighest Boat to us, turn'd
their
their Canoes from us; and stooping down, shew'd us their
naked Backsides, just as if in English, saving your Pre-
sence, they had bid us kiss- ;whether this was a
Defiance or Challenge, we know not; or whether it was
done in mere Contempt, or a Signal to the rest; but
immediately Friday cry'd out, they were going to shoot,
and unhappily for him (poor Fellow) they let fly about
300 of their Arrows; and, to my inexpressible Grief, kill'd
poor Friday, no other Man being in their Sight. The
poor Fellow was shot with no less than three Arrows, and
about three more fell very nigh him; such unlucky Marks-
men they were.
I was so enrag'd with the Loss of my old Servant,
the Companion of all my Sorrows and Solitudes, that I
immediately ordered five Guns to be loaded with small
Shot, and four with great, and gave them such a Broad-
side, as they had never heard in their Lives before, to be
sure.
They were not above half a Cable's Length off when
.we fir'd, and our Gunners took their Aim sb well, that
three or four of their Canoes were overset, as we had
Reason to believe, by one Shot only.
The ill Manners of turning up their bare Backsides to
us, gave us no great Offence; neither did I know for
certain, whether that which would pass for the greatest
Contempt among us, might be understood so by them,
or not; therefore in Return, I had only resolv'd to have
fir'd four or five Guns with Powder only; which I knew
would fright them sufficiently: But when they shot at us
-directly with all the Fury they were capable of, and esoe-
-cially as they had kill'd my poor Friday, whom I so intirely
lovtt and valu'd, and who indeed so well deserv'd it; I
not only had been justified before God and Man, but
would have been very glad, if I could, to have over-
set every-Canoe there, and drowned every one of 'em.
1 can neither tell how many we kill'd, or how many
we wounded, at this Broadside; but sure such a Fright and
Hurry never was seen among such a Multitude; there were
13 or 14-of their Canoes split and overset in all, and the
Men all set a swimming; the rest, frighted out of their
Wits, scour'd away as sast as they -could; taking but little
-Care to save those whose Boats were split or spoil'd with
.our Shot: S», I suppose that they were many of them
lost:
lost: And our Men took up one poor Fellow swim-
ming for his Life above an Hour after they were all
gone.
Our small Shot from our Cannon must needs kill and
wound a great many; bur, in short, we never knew any
thing how it went with them; for they fled so sast, that
in three Hours, or thereabouts, we could not fee above
three or four straggling Canoes; nor did we ever fee the
rest any more; for a Breeze of Wind springing up the same
Evening, we weighed and set sail for the Srnfils.
W e had a Prisoner indeed; but the Creature was so
sullen, that he would neither eat or speak; and we all sansy'd
he would starve himself to Death: But I took a way to cure
him; for I made them take him and turn him into the Long
Boat, and make him believe they would toss him into the
Sea again, and so leave him where they found him, if he
would not speak; nor would that do, but they really did
throw him into the Sea, and came away from him; and
then he follow'd them; for he swam like a Cork, and
call'd to them in his Tongue, though they knew not one
Word of what he said: However, at last they took him
in again, and then he began to be more tractable; nor did
I ever design they should drown him.
We were now under Sail again ; but I was the most
disconsolate Creature alive, tor want of my Man Eriday,
and would have been very glad to have gone back to the
Island, to have taken one ot the rest from thence for my
Occasion, but it could not be; so we went on: We had
one Prisoner, as I have said ,- and 'twas a long while before
we could make him understand any thing; but, in time,
our Men taught him some English, and he began to be a
little tractable; afterwards we inquir'd what Country he
came from, but could make nothing of what he said; for
his Speech was so odd, all Gutturals, and spoken in the
Throat, in such an hollow and odd Manner, that we could
never form a Word from him; and we were all of Opi-
nion that they might speak that Language as well, if they
were gagged, as otherwise; nor could we perceive that
they had any Occasion, either for Teeth, Tongue, Lips,
or Palate; but formed their Words, just as a hunting Horn
forms a Tune with an open Throat; he told us however,
some time after, whan we had taught him to speak a
little English, that they were going with their Kings to
fight a great Battle. When he said Kings, we ask'd him
x how
how many Kings? He faid, there were Vi ve Nation,
{we could not make him understand the Plural S) and that
they all join'd to go against Two Nation. We ask'd him,
What made them come up to us? He faid, to makee te
great Wonder look: Where it is to be observed, That all
those Natives, as also those of Africa, when they learn
English, they always add two E's at the End of the Words
where we use one, and place the Accent upon the last of
them, as makee, takee, and the like; and we could not
break them of it; nay, I could hardly make Friday leave
it off, tho' at last he did.
And now I name the poor Fellow once more, I must
take my last Leave of him; poor honest Friday ! We buried
him with all Decency and Solemnity possible, by putting
him into a Coffin, and throwing him into the Sea; and I
caus'd them to fire eleven Guns for him; and so ended
the Lite of the most grateful, faithful, honest, and most
affectionate Servant that ever Man had.
W e went now away with a fair Wind for Brafil, and
in about twelve Days time we made Land in the Latitude
of five Degrees South of the Line, being the North-Easter-
most Land of all that Part of America; We kept on S. by
E. in sight of the Shore four Days, when we made the
Cape St. Augustine, and in three Days came to an Anchor
off of the Bay of All-Saints, the old Place of my Deliverance,
from whence came both my good and evil Fate.
Never Ship came to this Part that had less Business
than 1 had; and yet it was with great Difficulty that we
were admitted to hold the least Correspondence on Shore:
Not my Partner himself, who was alive, and made a great
Figure among them; not my two Merchants Trustees,
nor the Fame of my wonderful Preservation in the Island,
could obtain me that Favour: But my Partner remember-
ing, that I had given foo Moidores to the Prior of the
Monastery ot theAugujlines, and 372 to the Poor, went to
the Monastery, and oblig'd the Prior that then was, to go
to the Governor, and get Leave for me presently, with
the Captain and one more, besides eight Seamen, to come
on Shore, and no more; and this upon Condition absolutely
capitulated for, that we should not offer to land any Goods
out of the Ship, or to carry any Person away without
Licence.
They were so strict with us, as to landing any Goods,
that it was with extreme Difficulty that I got on Shore
G three
three Bales of English Goods, such as fine Broad-Cloaths,
Stuffs, and some Linen, which I had brought for a Pre-
sent to my Partner.
He was a very generous broad-hearted Man, tho' (like
me) he came from little at first; and though he knew not
that I had the least Design of giving him any Thing, he
sent me on board a Present of fresh Provisions, Wine, and
-Sweetmeats, worth above 30 Moidorcs, including some
Tobacco, and three or four fine Medals in Gold: But I was
e.ven with him in my Present, which as I have faid, con-
sisted of sine Broad-Cloth, English Stuffs, Lace, and fine
Hollands: Also I delivered him about the Value of 100 /.
Sterl. in the fame Goods for other Uses; and I obliged
Jiim to set up the Sloop which I had brought with me
from England, as I have faid, for the Use of my Colony,
in order to send the Refreshments I intended to my Plan-
tation.
Accordingly he got Hands, and finished the Sloop
in a very few Days, for she was already fram'd, and I
gave the Master of her such Instructions, as he could not
miss the Place, nor did he miss it, as I had an Account
from my Partner afterwards. I got him soon loaded with
the small Cargo I had sent them; and one of our Seamen,
that had been on Shpre with me there, offer'd to go with
the Sloop, and settle there upon my Letter to the Gover-
nor Spaniard to allot him a sufficient Quantity of Land for
a Plantation ; and giving him some Cloathes, and Tools for
his Planting-work, which he faid he understood, having
been an old Planter in Maryland, and a Buccaneer into the
Bargain.
I encouraged the Fellow by granting all he desir'd;
and as an Addition, I gave him the Savage which we had
taken Prisoner of War, to be his Slave, and order'd the Go-
vernor Spaniard to give him his Share of every Thing he
wanted with the rest.
When we came to fit this Man out, my old Partner
told me, there was a certain very honest Fellow, a Brafil
Planter of his Acquaintance, who had fallen into the Dis-
pleasure of the Church; I know not what the Matter is
with him, fays he, but on my Conscience, I think he is an
Heretick in his Ileart, and he has been obliged to conceal
himself for fear of the Inquisition, that he would be very
glad of such an .Opportunity to make his Escape with his
Wife and two Daughters; and if I would let them go to
m7
my Island, and allot them a Plantation, he would give
them a small Stock to begin with; for the Officers of the
Inquisition had sciad all his Effects and Estate, and he had
nothing left but a little Houshold Stuff and two Slaves.
And, adds he, tho' I hate his Principles, yet I would not
have him sall into their Hands, for he will assuredly be
burnt alive, if he does.
I 6ranted this presently, and join'd my Englishman
with them, and we conceal'd the Man, and his Wife and
Daughters, on board our Ship, till the Sloop put out to go
to Sea; and then (having put all their Goods on board the
Sloop some time before) we put them on board the Sloop,
alter he was got out of the Bay.
Our Seaman was mightily pleas'd with this new Part-
ner; and their Stock indeed was much alike rich in Tools,
in Preparations, and a Farm ; but nothing to begin with
but as above: However, they carried over with them
(which was worth all the rest) some Materials for planting
Sugar Canes, with some Plants of Canes; which he, I mean
the Portugal Man, understood very well.
Among the rest of the Supplies sent my Tenants in the
Island, I sent them by this Sloop three Milch Cows, and
five Calves, about twenty-two Hogs among them, three
Sows big with Pig, two Mares, and a Stone-horse.
For my Spaniards, according to my Promise, I engag'd
three Portugal Women to go, and recommended it to 'em
to marry them, and use them kindly. I could have pro-
cured more Women, but I remember'd, that the poor per-
secuted Man had two Daughters, and there were but five of
the Spaniards that wanted; the- rest had Wives of their own
tho' in another Country.
All this Cargo arriv'd safe, and as you may easily sup-
pose, very welcome to my old Inhabitants, who were now
(with this Addition) between sixty and seventy People, be-
sides little Children; of which, there was a great many: I
found Letters at London from them all by way of Lisbon,
when I came back to England; being sent back to theBra-
fils by this Sloop, of which I fi;all take some Notice in its
Place.
I have now done with my Island, and all Manner of
Discourse about it; and whoever reads ^hc rest of my Me-
morandums, would do well to turn his Thoughts entirely
from it, and expect to read only of the Follies of an old
Man, not warn'd by his own Harms, much less by those
G x ot
of other Men, to beware of the like; not cool'd by almost:
forty Years Misery and Difappointments, not fatisfy'd with
Prosperity beyond Expectation, not made cautious by Afflic-
tion and Distress beyond Imitation.
I had no more Business to go to the last-Indies, than
a Man at full Liberty, and having committed no Crime,
has to go to the Turnkey at Newgate, and desire him to
lock him up among the Prisoners there, and starve him:
Had I taken a small Vessel from England, and went di-
rectly to the Island; had I loaded her, as I did the other
Vessel, with all the Necessaries for the Plantation, and for
my People, took a Patent from the Government here, to
have secur'd my Property, in Subjection only to that of
England, which to be sure I might have obtain'd; had I
carried over Cannon and Ammunition, Servants, and People
to plant, and taking Possession of the Place, fortified and
strengthen' d it in the Name of England, and increas'd it
with People, as I might easily have done; had I then
fettled myself there, and sent the Ship back, loaden with
good Rice, as I might also have done in six Months
Time, and order'd my Friends to have fitted her out again
for our Supply; had I done this and staid there" myself,
I had, at least acted like a Man of common Sense; but
1 was pofless'd with a wandering Spirit, lcorn'd all Advan-
tages, pleas'd myself with being the Patron of those Peo-
ple I had placed there, and doing for them in a kind of
haughty majestick Way, like an old Patriarchal Monarch,-
providing for them, as if I had been Father of the whole
Family, as well as of the Plantation: But I never ib
much as pretended to plant 'in the Name of any Govern-
ment or Nation, or to acknowledge any Prince, or to
call my People Subjects to any one Nation more than
another; nay, I never so much as gave the Place a
Name; but left it as I found it, belonging to no Man,-
and the People under no Discipline or Government but
my own; who, tho' I had an Influence over them as Fa-
ther and Benefactor, had no Authority or Power, to act
or command one way or other, farther than voluntary
Consent mov'd them to comply; yet even this, had I
staid there would have done well enough; but as I rambled
from them, and came there no more, the last Letters I
had from any of them, were by my Partner's Means; who
afterwards sent another Sloop to the Place, and who sent
me word, though I had not the Letter till five Years after
it
it was written, that they went on but poorly, were male-
content with their long Stay there; that Will. Atkins was
dead; that five of the Spaniards were come away, and that
tho' they had not been much molested by the Savages, yet
they had had some Skirmishes with them; that they beg'd
of him to write to me, to think of the Promise I.
had made to fetch 'em away, that they might see their
own Country again before they dy'd.
But I was gone a -wild Goose Chctce indeed; and they
who will have any more of me, must be content to follow
me through a new Variety of Follies, Hardships, and wild
Adventures; wherein the Justice of Providence may be
duly observed, and we may see how easily Heaven can gorge
us with our own Desires, make the strongest of our Wishes
to be our Affliction, and punish us most severely with
those very Things, Which we think it would be our utmost
Happiness to be allow'd in.
Let no wife Man flatter himself, with the Strength of
his own Judgment, as if he was able to chuse any particu-
lar Station of Life for himself: Man is a short-lighted
Creature, sees but a very little way before him; and as his
Passions are none of h.s best Friends, so his particular
Affections are generally his worst Counsellors.
I s a y this, with respect to the impetuous Desire I had
from a Youth, to wander into the World; and how e"i-
dent it now was, that this Principle was preferv'd in me
for my Punishment: How it came on, the Manner, the
Circumstance, and the Conclusion of it, it is easy to give
you historically, and with its utmost Variety of Particulars.
But the secret Ends of Divine Providence, in thus permit-
ting us to be hurry'd down the Stream of our own Desires,
is only to be understood of those who can listen to the
Voice of Providence, and draw religious Consequences
from God's Justice, and their own Mistakes.
B e it, 1 had Business, or no Business, away I went;
'tis no Time now to enlarge any farther upon the Reason
or Absurdity of my own Conduct; but to come to the
History, 1 was embarked for the Voyage, and the Voyage
I went. a
I should only add here, that my honest and truly pious
Clergyman left me here; a Ship being ready to go to Lis-
bon. he ask'd me leave to go thither; being still, as he ob-
Jery'd, bound never to finish any Voyage he began; how
happy had it been for me, if I had gone with him!
G 3 j But
But it was too late now; all Things Heaven appoints
are best ; had I gone with him, I had never had so many
Things to ke thankful for, and you had never heard of the
Second Part of the Travels and Adventures of Robinson
Crusoe; so I must leave here the fruitless exclaiming at my-
self, and go on with my Voyage.
From the Brafih we made directly away over the At-
lantick Sea, to the Cafe de bon Esperance, or, as we call it,
the Cape of Good Hope; and had a tolerable good Voyage,
our Course generally South-Eastnow and then a Storm,
and some contrary Winds: But my Difasters at Sea were at
an End; nay future Rubs and cross Events were to befal
me on Shore; that it might appear, the Land was as well
prepar'd to be our Scourge, as the Sea; when Heaven, who
directs the Circumstances of Things, pleases to appoint it
to be so.
Our Ship was on a Trading Voyage, and had a Supra-
Cargo on board, who was to direct all her Motions after
she arriv'd at the Cape; only being limitted to certain Num-
bers of Day.1, for Stay, by Charter-party, at the several
Ports she was to go to: This was none of my Business,
neither did I meddle with it at all; my Nephew the Cap-
tain, and the Supra-Cargo, adjusting all those Things be-
tween them, as they thought fit.
We made no stay at xkcCape, longer than was needful,
to take in fresh Water; but made the best of our Way
for the Coast of Coromandel; we were indeed informed,
that a French Man of War of fifty Guns, and two large
Merchant Ships, were gone for the Indies, and as I knew
we were at War with France, I had some Apprehensions
of them ; but they went their own way, and we heard no
more of them.
I shall not pester my Account, or the Reader, with
Descriptions of Places, Journals of our Voyages, Variations
of the Compass, Latitudes, Meridian-Distances, Trade-
Winds, Situation of Ports, and the like; such as almost all
the Histories of long Navigation are full of, and which
make the reading tiresome enough, and are perfectly un-
profitable to all that read, except only to those, who are
to go to those Places themselves.
I t is enough to name the Ports and Places, which we
touch'd at, and what occurr'd to us upon our passing from
one to another: We touch'd first at the Island of Mada-
gascar i where, tho' the People are fierce and treacherous,
and
and in particular, very well arm'd with Launces and Bows,
which they use with inconceivable Dexterity, yet we sared
very well, with them a while; they treated us very civilly,
and for some Trifles which we gave them, such as Knives,
Scislars, e^r.they brought us eleven good sat Bullocks, mid-
dling in Size, but very good in Flesh; which we took in',
partly for fresh Provisions for our present spending, and the
rest to salt for the Ship's Use.
W e were obliged to stay here some Time, after we had
furnished our selves with Provisions ,- and I, that was iU
ways too curious, to look into every Nook of the World
where-evef I came, Was for going on Shore as often as I
could: It was on the East-side of the Island that we went
on Shore one Evening, and the People, who by the Way,
are -very numerous, came thronging about us, and stood
gazing at us at a Distance: As we had traded freely with
them, and had been kindly used, we thought our selves in
fio Danger; but when we saw the People, we cut three
Boughs out of a Tree, and stuck them up at a Distance
from us, which, it seems, is a Mark in the Country, not
only of Truce and Friendship, but when it is accepted, the
other Side let up three Poles or Boughs also, which is a
Signal that they accept the Truce too; but then, this is a
known Condition of the Truce, that you are not to pass
beyond their three Poles towards them, nor they come past
your three Poles or Boughs, toward you; so that you are
perfectly secure within the three Poles, and all the Space
between your Poles and theirs, is allow'd like a Market,
for free Converse, Traffick, and Commerce: When you
go thither, you must not carry your Weapons with you;
and if they come into that Space, they stick up their Ja-
velins and Launces, all at the first Poles, and come on un-
arm'd; but if any Violence is offer'd them, and the Truce
thereby broken, away they run to the Poles, and lay hold
of their Weapons, and then the Truce is at an End.
I t happened one Evening when we went on Shore, that?
a greater Number of their People came down than usual,
but all was very friendly and civil: They brought with
them several Kinds of Provisions, for which we satisfied
them with such Toys as we had ; their Women also
brought us Milk, and Roots, and several things very ac-
ceptable to us, and all was quiet; and.we made us a little
Tent or Hut of some Boughs of Trees, and lay on Shore
all that Night.
I k m o f not what was the Oceasion, but I was not so
well satisfied to lie on Shore as the rest, and the Boat lying
at an Anchor, about a Stone's Cast from the Land,'with
two Men in her to take Care of her; I made one of 'em
come on Shore, and getting some Boughs of Trees to co-
ver us also in the Boat, I spread the Sail on the Bottom
of the Boat, and lay on board under the Cover of the
Branches of the Trees all Night.
About two a-Clock in the Morning, we heard one
of our Men make a terrible Noise on the Shore, calling out
for God's Sake, to bring the Boat in, and come and help
them, for they were all like to be murdered ; at the lame
time, I heard the firing of five Mulquets, which was the
Number of the Guns they had, and that three Times
over, for it seems, the Natives here were not so easily
frighted with Guns, as the Savages were in America, where
I had to do with them.
All this while, I knew not what was the Matter; but
rouzing immediately from Sleep with the Noise, I caused
the Boat to be thrust in, and resolv'd, with three Fusils we
had on Board, to land, and assist eur Men.
W e got the Boat soon to the Shore, but our Men were
in too much haste: For being come to the Shore, they
plung'd into the Water, to get to the Boat, with all the
Expedition they could, being pursued by between three
and four hundred Men: Our Men were but nine in all,
and only five of them had Fusils with them; the rest in-
deed had Pistols and Swords, but they were of small Uie
to them.
W e took up seven of our Men, and with Difficulty
enough too, three of them being very ill wounded; and that
which was still worse, was, that while we stood in the
Boat to take our Men in, we were in as much Danger as they
were in on Shore; for they pour'd their Arrows in upon
us so thick, that we were fain to barricade the Side of the
Boat up with the Benches, and two or three loose Boards,
which, to our great Satissaction, we had by mere Acci-
dent, tr ProvUence rather, in the Boat.
And yet, had it been Day-light, they are, it seems,
such exact Marksmen, that if they could have seen but the
least Part of any of us, they would have been sure of us;
we had by the Light of the Moon a little Sight of them,
as they stood pelting us from the Shore with Darts and
Arrows; and having got ready our Fire-Arms, we gave
them
them a Volley, and we could hear by the Cries of some
of them, that we had wounded several; however, they
stood thus in Battle-Array on the Shore 'till break of Diy.
which we suppose was, that they might fee the better to
take their Aim at us.
In this Condition we lay, and could not tell how to
weigh our Anchor, or set up our Sail, because we must:
needs stand up in the Boat, and they were as sure to hit
us, as we were to hit a Bird in a Tree with small Shot;
we made Signals of Distress to the Ship, which tho' she
rode a League off, yet my Nephew the Captain, hearing
our Firing, and by Glasses perceiving the Posture we lay
in, and that we fir'd towards the Shore, pretty well un-
derstood us; and weighing Anchor with all Speed, he
stood as near the Shore as he durst with the Ship, and there
sent another Boat, with ten Hands in her, to assist u<; but:
we call'd to them not to come too near, telling 'em what
Gondition we were in: However, they stood in nearer to
us; and one of the Men taking the End of a Tow-line
in his Hand, and keeping our Boat between him and the
Enemy, so that they could not perfectly see him, swam
on board us, and made the Line fast to the Boat; upon
which we flipp'd our little Cable, and leaving pur Anchor
behind, they tow'd us out of the Reach of the Arrows,'
we all the while lying close behind the Barricado we had
made.
A s soon as we were got from between the Ship and
the Shore, that she could lay her Side to the Shore, we
run along just by them, and we poured in a Broadside
among them, loaden with Pieces of Iron and Lead, smill
Bullets, and such Stuff, besides the great Shot; which.
made a terrible Havock among them.
When we were got on board, and out of Danger, we:
had Time to examine into the Occasion of this Fray; and
indeed our Supra-Cargo, who had been often in those Parts,
put me upon it; for he faid, he was sure the Inhabitants
would not have touch'd us, after we had made a Truce,
if we had not done something to provoke them to it: Ac
length it came out, (viz..) that an old Woman, who had
come to sell us some Milk, had brought it within our
Poles, with a young Woman with her, who also brought
some Roots or Herbs; and while the old Woman (whe-
ther she was Mother to the young Woman or no, they
could not tell) was selling us the Milk, one of our Men
G f offer d
t ijO
offer'd some Rudeness to the Wench that was with her,
at which the old Woman made a great Noise : However,
the Seaman would not quit his Prize, but carried her our
of the old Woman's Sight, among the Trees, it being al-
most dark; the old Woman went away without her, and
as we suppose, made an Out-cry among the People she
came from; who, upon Notice, rais'd this great Army up-
on us in three or four Hours; and it was great Odds, but
we had been all destroyed.
Ohe of our Men was killed with a Launce that was
thrown at him, just at the Beginning of the Attack, as he
fally'd out of the Tent we had made;- the rest came off
free, all but the Fellow who was the Occasion of all the
Mischief, who paid dear enough for his black Mistress; for
we could not hear what became of him, a great while; we
lay upon the Shore two Days after, though the Wind pre~
sen ed, and made Signals for him -y made our Boat fail up
Shore and down Shore, several Leagues, but in vain; lo-
we were obliged to give him over, and if he alone had.
iuffer'd for it, the Loss had been the less.
I could not fatisfy myself, however; without ven-
turing on Shore once more, to try if I could learn any
thing of him, or them i it was the third Night after the
Action, that I had a great Mind to learn, if I could by any
Means, what Mischief we had done, and how the Game
stood on the Indian Side: I was careful to do it in the
dark, lest we should be attack'd again; but I ought indeed
to have been sure, that the Men I went with, had been un*
der my Command, before 1 engaged in a Thing so hazar--
dous and mischievous, as I was brought into by- it, without
my Knowledge or Design.
W e took twenty stout Fellows with us as any in the
Ship, besides the Supra-Cargo and myself, and we landed
two Hours before Midnight, at the fame Place where the
Indians flood drawn up the Evening before; I landed here,.
i erause my Design, as I have faid, was chiefly to fee if
they had quitted the Field, and if they had left-any Marks
behind them of the Mischief we had done them; and I
thought if we could surprize one or two ot them,
perhaps we might get our Man again, by way of Ex-
change.
We landeed without any Noise, and divided our Men
into two Companies, whereof the Boatswain commanded
one, and I the other: We neither could heir nor sec any
Bod/
Body stir when we landed, so we marched up, ore Body
at a Distance from the other, to the Field of Battle: At first
we could see nothing, it being very dark ; but by and by,
our Boatswain, that led the first Party, stumbled and fell
over a dead Body; this made them halt a while; for know-
ing by the Circumstances that they were at the Place
where the Indians had stood, they waited for my coming
up ; here we concluded to halt till the Moon began to rise,
which we knew would be in less than an Hour; and then
we could easily discern the Havock we had made among
them i we told two and thirty Bodies upon the Ground,
whereof two were not quite dead: Some had an Arm,
and some a Leg shot off, and one his Head; those
that were wounded^ we supposed they had carried a-
way.
When we had made, as I thought; a full Discovery
of all we could come at the Knowledge of, I was for go-
ing on Board again ; but the Boatswain and his Party of-
ten, sent me Word, that they were resolved to make a
Visit to the Indian Town, where these Dogs, as they called
them, dwelt, and desired me to go along with them; and
if they could find them, as still they sansied they mould,
they did not doubt, they said, getting a good Booty, and
it might be, they might find Tho. Jeffrys there, that was
the Man's Name we had lost.
Had they sent to ask my Leave to go, I knew well
enough what Answer to have given them ; tor I would
have commanded them instantly on board, knowing it was
not a Hazard fit for us to run; who had a Ship and Ship's
Loading in our Charge, and a Voyage to make, which de-
pended very much upon the Lives of the Men; but as
they sent me Word they were resolved to go, and only ask'd
me and my Company to go along with them; I positively
refus'd it, and rose up, for I was fitting on the Ground, in
order to goto the Boat; one or two of the Men, began to
importune me to go, and when I still refused positively be-
gan ro grumble, and say they were not under my Com-
mand, and they would go : Come Jack, says one of the
Men, will you go with me? I'll go for one. Jack said he
would, and another f6llow'd, and then another; and in a
Word, they all left me but one, who, with much Difficul-
ty too, I persuaded to stays so the Supra-Cargo and I, with
their Men, went back to the Boat, where, I told them,
we would stay for them, and take Care to take in as many
G 6 of
of them as should be left; for I told them, it was a mad
Thing they were going about, and supposed most of 'em
would run the Fate of Tho. Jeffrys.
They told me, like Seamen, they'd warrant it they
would come off again, and they would take Care, &c. So
away they went: I intreated them to consider the Ship and
the Voyage ; that their Lives were not their own, and
that they were entrusted with the Voyage in some mea-
sure; that if they miscarried, the Ship might be lost for
Want of their Help, and that they could not answer it to
Cod and Man: I laid a great deal more to them on that
Head, but I might as well have talk'd to the Main-mast of
the Ship, they were mad upon their Journey, only they
gave me good Words, and begg'd I would not be angry i
laid, they would be very cautious, and they did not doubt
but they would be back again in about an Hour at far-
thest, for the Indian Town, they faid, was not above half a
Mile off: Tho' they found it (dove two Miles before they got
to it.
Well, they all went away, as above; and though the
Attempt was desperate, and such, as none but Madmen
would have gone about, yet to give them their due, they
went about it warily as well as boldly: They were gallantly
armed, that is true; for they had every Man a Fusil or Mus-
tpet, a Bayonet, and every Man a Pistol; some of them
had broad Cutlaces, some of them Hangers, and the Boat-
swain and two more had Pole-Axes: Besides all which,
they had among them thirteen Hand-Grenadoes: Bolder
JUlows, and better provided, never went about any wicked
.Work in the World.
When they went out, their chief Design was Plunder
and they were in mighty Hopes of finding Gold there; but a
Circumstance which none of them were aware of, set
them on Fire with Revenge, and made Devils of them all:
When they came to the few Indian Houses, which they
thought had been the Town, which were not above half a
.Mile ofF; they were under a great Difappoinment, for
there were not above u or thirteen Houses, and where
the Town was, or how big, they knew not: They con-
sulted therefore what to do, and were some time before
-they could resolve; for if they fell upon these, they must cut
all their Throats, and it was ten to one but some of them
might escape, it being in the Night, tho' the Moon was
up; and if one escaped, he would run away, and raise
all the Town, so they should have a whole Army upon
them: Again on the other Hand, if they went away and
left those untouch'd, (for the People were all aQeep) they
could not tell which Way to look for the Town.
However, the last was the best Advice; so they re-
solved to leave those Houses, and look for the Town as
well as they could: They went on a little Way, and found
a Cow tied to a Tree; this they presently concluded, would
be a good Guide to them; for they said, the Cow cer-
tainly belonged to the Town before them, or the Town
behind them ; and if they untied her, they should see which
Way she went; if slie went back they had nothing to say
to her; but if she went forward, they had nothing to do
but to follow her; so they cut the Cord, which was made
of twisted Flags, and the Cow went on before them ; in
a Word, the Cow led them directly to the Town, which
as they reported, consisted of above 100 Houses, or Huts; and
in some of these, they found several Families living together.
Here they found all silent ; as profoundly secure, as
Sleep, and a Country that had never seen an Enemy of
that Kind, could make them; upon this, they called another
Council to consider what they had to do; and, in a Word,
they resolv'd to divide themselves into three Bodies, and to
set three Houses on Fire in three Parts of the Town; and
as the Men came out, to seize them and bind them; if
any resisted, they need not be ask'd what to do then, and
so to search the rest of the Houses for Plunder; but they
resolv«d to march silently first, thro' the Town, and fee what
Demenilons it was of, and consider if they might venture
upon it or no.
They did so, and desperately resolv'd that they would
venture upon them; but while they were animating one
another to the Work, three of them that were a little be-
fore the rest call'd out aloud, and told them them they had
found Tho. Jeffrys; they all ran up to the Place, and so it
was indeed, for there they found the poor Fellow hang'd
up naked by one Arm, and his Throat cut; there was an
Indian House just by the Tree, where they found sixteen or
seventeen of the principal Indians who had been concern'd
in the Fray with us before, and two or three of them
wounded with our Shot; and our Men found they were
awake, and talking one to another in that House, but knew
not their Number.
The Sight of their poor mangled Comrade so enraged
""' "" ". them,
'e'rri, as before, that they swore to one another they would
be revenged, and that not an Indian who came into their
Hands should have Quarter, and to work they went imme-
diately; and yet not so madly as by the Rage and Fury
fffey were in, might be expected: The first Care was to
get something that would soon take Fire, but after a little
search, they round that would be to no Purpose, for most
of the Houses were low, and thatch'd with Flags or Rushes,
of which the Country is full; so they presently made some
wild Fire, as we call it, by wetting a little Powder in the
Palms of their Hands, and in a Quarter of an Hour they
set the Town on Fire in four or five Places; and particu-
larly that House where the Indians were not gone to Bed;
As soon as the Fire began to blaze, the poor frighted Crea-
tures began to rush out to save their Lives; but met with
their Fate in the Attempt, and especially at the Door, where
they drove them back, the Boatswain himself killing one
or two with his Pole-Ax; the House being large, and
many in it, he did not care to go in, but call'd for a Hand-
Grenado, and threw it among 'em, which at first frighted
'em; but when it burst, made such Havock among "em,
that they cried out in a hideous Manner.
I n short, most of the Indians who were in the open
Part of the House, were kill'd or hurt with the Grenado, ex-
cept two or three more who press'd to the Door, which
the Boatswain and two more kept with their Bayonets in
the Muzzles of their Pieces, and dispatch'd all who came
that Way. But there was another Apartment in the Houle
where the Prince or King, or whatsoever he was, and
several others were, and they kept in till the House, which
was by this Time all of a light Flame, fell in upon them
and they were smothered or burnt together.
All this while they fir'd not a Gun, because they
would not waken the People saster than they could master
them; but the Fire began to waken them sast enough,
and our Fellows were glad to keep a little together in Bo-
dies; for the Fire grew so raging, all the Houses being made
of light combustible Stuff, that they could hardly bear the
Street between them, and their Business was to follow the Fire
for the surer Execution: As sast as the Fire either fore'd the
Peo, le out of those Houses which were burning, or frighted
th«m out of others, our People were ready at their Doors to
knock them on the Head, still calling and hlalowing to one
another to remember The. Jejfry},
While
While this was doing, I must confess I was very un-
easy, and especially when I saw the Flames of the Town,
which, it being Night, seem'd to be just by me.
My Nephew, the Captain, who was rouzd by his Men'
too, seeing such a Fire was very uneasy, not ktfowing
what the Matter was, or what Danger 1 was in; especially
hearing the Guns too, for by this Time they began to use
their Fire-Arms; a thousand Thoughts opprest his Mind'
concerning me and the Supra-Cargo; what should become
of us: And, at last, though he could ill spate any ntfore
Men, yet not knowing what Exigence he might be in,
he takes another Boat, and with r'j Men and himself,
comes on Shore to me.
H e was surpriz'd to see me and the Supra-Cargo in the
Boat with no more than two Men, for one had been left to
keep the Boat; and tho' he was glad that we were well,
yet he was in the same Impatience with us to know what
was doing; for the Noise continued, and the Flame in-
creas'd: 1 confess, it was next to an Impossibility for any
Men in the World to restrain their Curiosity of knowing
what had happened, or their Concern for the Safety of the
Men: In a Word, the Captain told me, he would go and
help his Men, let what would come : I argued with him,
as I did before with the Men, the Safety of the Ship, and
the Danger of the Voyage, the Interest of the Owners and
Merchants, &c. and told him, I would go and the two
Men, and only see if we could at a Distance, learn what
was like to be the Event, and come back and tell him.
I t was all one, to talk to my Nephew, as it was to
talk to the rest before; he would go, he said, and he only
wished he had left but ten Men in the Ship; for he could,
not think of having his Men lost for Want of Help, he had'
rather, he said, lose the Ship, the Voyage, and his Life
and all; and so away went he.
Nor was I any more able to stay behind now, than I
was to persuade them not to go before; so in short, the
Captain ordered two Men to row back the Pinnace, and
fetch twelve Men more from the Ship, leaving the Long-
Boat at an Anchor, and that when they came back, six
Men should keep the two Boats, and six more come after
us ; so that he left only 16 Men in the Ship ;for the whole
Ship's Company consisted of 6y Men, whereof two were
lost in.-the first Quarrel, whsek brought this Mischief on.
Bbino
Being now on the March, you may be sure we felt
little of the Ground we trod on; and being guided by the
Fire, we kept no Path, but went directly to the Place of
the Flame: If the Noise of the Guns were surprizing to us
before, the Cries of the poor People were now of quite
another Nature, and fill'd us with Horror : I must con-
fess I never was at the sacking of a City, or at the taking
of a Town by Storm ; I have heard of Oliver Cromvpd
taking Drogheda in Ireland, and killing Man, Woman and
Child: And I had read of Count Tilly, sacking of the City
of Magdeburgb, and cutting the Throats of 21000 of all
Sexes: But 1 never had an Idea of the Thing itself before,
nor is it possible to describe it, or the Horror which was
upon our Minds at hearing it.
However, we went on, and, at length, came to the
Town, though there was no entring the Streets of it for the
Fire: The first Object we met with, was the Ruins of a
Hut or House, or rather the Ashes of it, for the House was
consum'd ; and just before it, plain now to be seen by the
Light of the Fire, lay four Men and three Women kill'd;
and as we thought, one or two more lay in the Heap
among the Fire: In short, there were such Instances of a
Rage altogether barbarous, and of a Fury, something be-
yond what was human, that we thought it impossible our
Men could be guilty of it; or if they were the Authorsof
it, we thought that every one of them ought to be put to
the worst ot Deaths: But this was not all, we saw the
Fire increased forward, and the Cry went on just as the
Fire went on, so that we were in tie utmost Confusion;
We advanced a little Way sarther; and beheld, to our Asto-
nishment, three Women naked, crying in a most dread-
ful Manner, and flying, as if they had indeed had Wings,
and after them sixteen or seventeen Men, Natives, in the
same Terror and Consternation, with three of our English
Butcher', fir I can call them no better, in the Rear ; who,
when they could not overtake them, fir'd in among them,
and one that was kill'd by their Shot fell down in our
Sight; when- the rest saw us, believing us to be their Ene-
mies, and that we would murder them as well as those
that pursued them, they set up a most dreadful Shriek,
especially the Women; and two-of them fell down as if
already dead with the Fright.
M y very Soul shrunk within me, and my Blood ran
chill in my Veins, when I saw this, and I believe had the
three
three English Sailors, that pursued them, come on, I had
made our Men kill them all: However, we took some
Ways to let the poor flying Creatures know, that we would
not hurt them, and immediately they came up to us, and
kneeling down; with their Hands lifted up, made pitious
Lamentation to us to save them, which we let them know
we would do; whereupon they kept altogether in a Huddle
close behind us for Protection : 1 left my Men drawn up
together, and chargJU them to hurt no Body, but, if possible,
to get at some of our People, and see what Devil it was
possessed them, and what they intended to do; and, in a
Word, to command them off; assuring them, that if they
stay'd till Day-light, they would have a hundred thousand
Men about their Ears: I say, I left them, and went among
those flying People, taking only two of our Men with
we; and there was indeed a pitious Spectacle among them:
Some of them had their Feet terribly burnt with trampling
and running thro' the Fire, others their Hands burnt, one
of the Women had sallen down in the Fire, and was al-
most burnt to Death before she could get out again; two
or three of the Men had Cuts in their Backs and Thighs
from our Men pursuing; and another was shot thro' the
Body, and died while I was there.
I w o u'b- sain have learned what the Occasion of all this
was, but I could, not understand one Word they said;
though by Signs, I perceived that some of them knew not
what was the Occalion themselves. I was so terrified in
my Thoughts at this outrageous Attempt, that I could not
stay there, but went back to my own Men ; I told them
my Resolution, and commanded them to follow me, when
in the very Moment came four of our Men with the Boat-
swain at their Head, running over the Heaps of Bodies they
had kill'd, allcover'd with Blood and Dust, as if they wanted
more People to massacre, when our Men hallowed to
them as loud as they could hollow, and with much ado,
one of them made them hear; so that they knew who we
were, and came up to us.
A s soon as the Boatswain saw us, he set up a Hallow
like a Shout or Triumph, for having, as he thought, more
Help come, and without bearing to hear me, Captain, says
he, Noble Captain, I am glad you are come; we have not
half done yet; Villains! Hell-hound Dogs! Til kill as many
of them as poor lorn has Hairs upon his Head. We have
iworn to spare none of them, we'll root out the very Na-
tion of them from the Earth; and thus he run os, out of
Breath too with Action, and would not give us Leave to
speak a Word.
A t last, raising my Voice, that I might silence him a
little; Barbarous Dog!said I, what are you doing? I won't
have one Creature touch'd more, upon Pain of Death : I
charge you up on your Life, to stop your Hands, and stand
still here, or you are a dead Man this Minute.
Why, Sir, fays he, Do you know -what you do, ot what
they have done ? If you want a Reason for what we have
done, come hither ; and with tint he shewed me the poor
Fellow hanging upon the Tree with his Throat cut.
I confess, I was urged then myself, and, at another
Time, should have been forward enough; but I thought
they had carried their Rage too far, and thought of Jacob's
Words to his Sons Simeon and Levi; Cursed be their Anger",
for it was fierce; and their Wrath, for it wks cruel. But
I had now a new Task upon my Hands; for when the
Men I carried with me faw the Sight as I had done, I had
as much to do to restrain them, as I should have had with
the other; nay, my Nephew himself fell in With them,
and told me in their Hearing, that he was only concern'd
for fear of the Men being over-powered, for as to the.Peo-»
pie, he thought not one of them ought to live; for they
had all glutted themselves with the Murder of the poor
Man, and that they ought to be used like Murderers-:
Vyon these Words, away run eight of my Men with rhs
Boatswain and his Crew, to complete their bloody Work;
and I seeing it quite out of my Power to restrain them,
came away pensive and fad; for I could not bear the Sight,
much less the horrible Noise and Cries of the poor Wretches
that fell into their Hands.
I g o t no Body *-o come back with me but the Supr/t-
Cargo and two Men ; and with these I walked back to
the Boats: It was a very great Piece of Folly in me, I
confess, to venture back, as it were alone ; for as it be-
gan now to be almost Day, and the Alarm had run over
the Country, there stood about 40 Men arm'd with Laun-
ces and Bows at the little Place where the 12 or 13 Houses
stood mentioned before; but by Accident I miss'd the
Place, and came directly to the Sea-side, and by the
Time I got to the Sea-side, it was broad Day; immediately
I took the Pinnace, and went aboard, and lent her back
to assist the Men in what might happen.
I otSERv-o that about the Time I came to the Boat-
side, the Fire was pretty well out, and the Noise abated;
but in about half an Hour after I got on board, I heard
a Volley of our Men's Fire-Arms, and faw a great Smoak;
this, as I understood afterwards was our Men falling upon
the forty Men, who, as I faid, stood at the few Houses
on the Way ; of whom they kill'd sixteen or seventeen,
and set all those Houses on Fire, but did not meddle with
the Women or Children.
By that Time the Men got to the Shore again with the
Pinnace, our Men began to appear; they came dropping
in, some and some; not in two Bodies, and in Form as
they went out, but all in Heaps, straggling here and there,
in such a Manner, that a small Force of resolute Men might
have cut them all off.
But the Dread of them was upon the whole Country:
The People were amaz'd, and surpriz'd, and so frighted,
that I believe a hundred of them would have fled at the
Sight of but five of our Men. Nor in all this terrible Ac-
tion was there a Man who made any considerable Defence;
they were so surpriz'd between the Terror of the Fire,
and the sudden Attack of our Men in the Dark, that
they knew not which Way to turn themselves; for if they
fled one Way, they were met by one Party, if back again,
by another; so that they were every where knock'd down:
.Nor did any of our Men receive the least Hurt, except
one who strain'd his Foot, and another had one of his
Hands very much burnt.
I w a s very angry with my Nephew the Captain, and
indeed with all the Men in my Mind, but with him in par-
ticular; as well for his acting so out of his Duty, as Com-
mander of the Ship, and having the Charge of the Voyage
upon him, as in his prompting, rather than cooling, the
Rage of his Men, in so bloody and cruel an Enterprize ..
My Nephew answered me very respectfully, but told me,
that when he faw the Body of the poor Seaman, whom
they had murdered in such a cruel and barbarous Manner,
he was not Master of himself, neither could he govern his
Passion: He own'd, he should not have done so, as he
was Commander of the Ship; but as he was a Man, and
Nature mov'd him, he could not bear it: As for the rest
of the Men, they were not subject to me at all, and they
knew it well enough; so they took no Notice of my
Dislike.
Ta e
The next Day we set sail, so we never heard any more
of it: Our Men differ'd in the Account of the Number
they kill'd; some said one Thing, some another: But ac-
cording to the best of their Accounts put all together,
they kill'd or destroy'd about ifo People, Men, Wo-
men and Children, and left not a House standing in the
Town.
A s for the poor Fellow, Tho. Jeffrys, as he was quite
dead, for his Throat was so cut, that his Head was half
off, it wou'd do him no Service to bring him away, so
they left him where they found him, only took him
down from the Tree where he was hanged by one
Hand.
However just our Men thought this Action to be,
I was against them in it; and I always, after that Time,
told them, God would blast the Voyage, for, I look'd up-
on all the Blood they shed that Night to be Murder ia
them: For tho' it is true, that they had kill'd Tho. Jeffrys,
yet it was as true, that Jeffrys was the Aggressor, had
broken the Truce, and had violated or debauched a young
Woman of theirs, who came to our Camp innocently;
and on the Faith of their Capitulation.
The Boatswain defended this Quarrel when we were
afterwards on Board: He said, It was true, that weseem'd
to break the Truce, but really had not, and that the War.
was begun the Night before by the Natives themselves,.
who had shot at us, and kill'd one of our Men without
any just Provocation; so that as we were in a Capacity to
fight them, we might also be in a Capacity to do ourselves
Justice upon them, in an extraordinary Manner; that tho"
the poor Man had taken Liberty with a Wench, he
ought not to have been murdered, and that in such a
villainous Manner: And that they did nothing but what
was just, and that the Laws of God allow'd to be done to
Murderers.
One would think this should have been enough to have
warn'd us against going on Shore among Heathens and
Barbarians; but it is impossible to make Mankind wife,but
at their own Experience, and their Experience seems to be
always ot most use to them, when it is dearest bought.
W e were now bound to the Gulph of Persia, and from
thence to the Coast ot Coromnnilel, only to touch at Su-
ratte; but the chief of the Supra-Curgo's Design lay at the
Bay of Bengale, where, if he miss'd of the Business out-
ward-
ward bound, he was to go up to China, and return to the
Coast as he came Home.
Thr first Disaster that befel us, was in the Gulph of
Persia, where five of our Men venturing on Shore, on the
Arabian Side of the Gulph, were surrounded by the Arabs,
and either all kill'd, or carried away into Slavery; the rest
of the Boat's Crew were not able to rescue them, and had
but just Time to get off their Boat: I began to upbraid
them with the just Retribution of Heaven in this Case;
but the Boatswain very warmly told me, he thought I
went sarther in my Censures, than I could shew any War-
rant for in Scripture, and referr'd to the 13 th of St. Luke,
Verse 4th, where our Saviour intimates, that those Men,
on whom the Tower of Silo am fell, were not Sinners above
all the Galileans; but that which indeed put me to Si-
lence in the Case, was that none of these five Men, who
were now lost, were of the Number of those who went
on Sfjpre to the Massacre of Madagascar; (so I always eall'd
it, though our Men could not bear the Word Massacre with any
Patience :) And indeed, this last Circumstance, as I have
said, put me to Silence for the present.
But my frequent preaching to them on this Subject,
had worse Consequences than I expected ; and the Boat-
swain, who had been the Head of the Attempt, came up
boldly to me one Time, and told me, he found that I
continually brought that Affair upon the Stage, that I made
unjust Reflections upon it, and had used the Men very ill
on that Account, and himself in particular; that as I
was but a Passenger, and had no Command in the Ship,
or Concern in the Voyage, they were not obliged to bear
it; that they did not know, but I might have some
ill Design in my Head, and perhaps to call them t<r Ac-
count for it, when they came to England; and that there-
fore, unless I would resolve to have done with it, and al-
so not to concern my self any sarther with him, or
any of his Affairs, he would leave the Ship; for he
did not think it was safe to sail with me among
them.'
I h e a r d him patiently enough till he had done, and
then told him, that I did confess I had all along opposed
the Massacre of Madagascar, for such I would always call
it; and that I had on all Occasions spoken my Mind free-
ly about it, though not more upon him than any of the
rest ; that as to my having no Command in the Ship, that
"'- - was
was true; nor did I exercise any Authority, only took my
Liberty of speaking my Mind in Things which publickly
concern'd us all s as to what Concern I had in the Voyage,
that was none of his Business; I was a considerable Owner
of the Ship; and in that Claim I conceived I had a Right
to speak, even sarther than I had yet done, and would not
be accountable to him, or any one elie, and began to be a
little warm with him: He made but little Reply to me at
that Time, and 1 thought that Afsair had been over: We
were at this Time in the Road of Bengal, and being [wil-
ling to lee the Place, I went on Shore with the Supra-Cargo
in the Ship's Boat, to divert myself, and towards Even-
ing, was preparing to go on Board, when one of the
Men came to me, and told me, he would not have me
trouble myscif to come down to the Boat, for they had
Orders not to cajry me on Board. Any one may guess
what a Surprize 1 was in at so insolent a Message; and
1 asked the Man, who bad him deliver that Errand to me?
He told me, the Cockswain ; I said no more to the Fel-
low, but bad him let them know he had delivered his Mes-
sage, and that I had given him no Answer to it.
I immediately went and found out the Supra-Cirgo, and
told him the Story, adding what I presently foresaw, (wz.)
That there would certainly be a Mutiny in the Ship, and
intreated him to go immediately on Board the Ship in an
Indian Boat, and acquaint the Captain of it; but I might
have spar'd this Intelligence, for before I had spoken to
him on Shore, the Matter was effected on Board, th*
Boatswain, the Gunner, the Carpenter, and, in a Word,
all the inferior Officers, as soon as I was gone off in the
Boat, came up to the Quarter-Deck, and desired to speak
with the Captain, and there the Boatswain making a long
Harangue, for the Fellow talk'd very well, and repeating
all he had said to me, told the Captain in few Words,
that as I was now gone peaceably on Shore, they were
loth to use any Violence with me; which, if I had not
gone on Shore, they would otherwise have done to oblige
me ta have gone: They therefore thought fit to tell him,
that as they shipp'd themselves to serve in the Ship under
his Command, they would perform it saithfully: But if I
would not quit the Ship, or the Captain oblige me to
quit it, they would all leave the Ship, and sail no sarther
with him; and at that Word ALL, he turn'd his Face
about towards the Main-mast, which was it seems the
-' Sig-
Signal agreed on between them ,- at which all the Seamen
being got together, they cried out, One and ALL, One
and ALL.
M y Nephew the Captain, was a Man of Spirit, and of
great Presence of Mind; and though he was surpriz.'d, you
may be sure, at the Thing, yet he told them calmly, that
he would consider of the Thing, but that he could do no-
thing in it, till he had spoken to me about it; he used
some Arguments with them, to shew them the Unreason-
ableness and Injustice ot the Thing, but it was all in vain,
they swore and shook Hands round, before his Face, that
they would go all on Shore, unless he would engage to
them, not to suffer me to come on board the Ship.
This was a hard Article upon him, who knew his Ob-
ligation to me, and did not know how I might take it;
so he began to talk cavalierly to them, told them, That I
was a very considerable Owner of the Ship, and that in
Justice he could not put me out of my own House; that
this was next Door to serving me, as the samous Pirate
Xid had done, who made the Mutiny in a Ship, set the
Captain on Shore in an uninhabited Island, and run away
with the Ship; that let them go into what Ship they would,
if ever they came to England again, it would eost them
dear; that the Ship was mine, and that he would nac
put me out of it <, and that he would rather lose the Ship
and the Voyage too, than disoblige me so much; so they
might do as they pleased: However he would go on Shore,
and talk with me on Shore, and invited the Boatswain to
go with him, and perhaps they might accommodate the
Matter with me.
But they all rejected the Proposal; and said. they would
have nothing to do with me any more, neither on Board,
nor on Shore; and if I came on Board, they would go on
Shore. Well, said the Captain, if you are all on this Mind,
let me go on Shore and talk with him; so away he came
to me with this Account, a little after the Message had been
brought to me from the Cockswain.
I was very glad to see my Nephew, I must confess;
for I was not without Apprehensions, that they would
confine him by Violence, set sail, and run away with the
Ship, and then I had been strips naked in a remote Coun-
try, and nothing to help myself: In short I had been in
a worse Case, thin when 1 was all alone in the Island.
But
But they had not come that length, it seems, to my
great Satisfaction; and when my Nephew told me what
they had faid to him, and how they had sworn, and shook
Hands, that they would one and all leave the Ship, if I was
suffer'd to come on board, I told him, he should not be
concern'd at it at all, for I would stay on Shore ; I only
desir'd he would take Care and send me all my necesfary
Things on Shore, and leave me a sufficient Sum of Money,
and I would find my Way to England, as well as I could.
This was a heavy Piece of News to my Nephew; but
there was no Way to help it, but to comply with it. So,
in short, he went on board the Ship again, and fatisfy'd
the Men, that his Uncle had yielded to their Importunity,
and had sent for his Goods from on board the Ship; so
the Matter was over in a very few Hours, the Men re-
turned to their Duty, and I began to consider what Course
I should steer.
I w a s now alone in the remotest Part of the World,
as I think I may call it; for I was near three thoufand
Leagues by Sea farther off from England, than I was at my
Island; only, it is true, I might travel here by Land over
the Great Mogul's Country to Surattt, might go from
thence to Basjora by Sea, up the Gulph of Perfia,vcA from
thence might take the Way of the Caravans, over the De-
farts of Arabia. to Aleppo and Scandaroon; from thence by
Sea again to Italy, and so over Land into France, and this
put together might be at least a full Diameter of the Globe;
but if it were to be measured, I suppose it would appeir
to be a great deal more.
I h a d another Way before me, which was to wait for
some English Ships, which were coming to Bengale from
Achin on the Island of Sumatra, and get Passage on board
them for England: But as I came hither without any Con-
cern with the English East-India Company, so it would be
difficult to go from hence without their Licence, unless
with great Favour of the Captains of the Ships, or of
the Company's Factors, and to both I was an utter Stranr
ger.
Here I had the particular Pleasure, speaking by Con-
traries, to see the Ship set fail without me; a Treatment,
I think, a Man in my Circumstances scarce ever met with,
except from Pirates running away with a Ship, and setting
those that would not agree with their Villainy on Shore,
indeed this was next Door to it, both Ways however,
my
4
nion, and one Servant, the first was Clerk to the Purser,
who he engag'd to go with me, and the other was his
own Servant; I took me also a good Lodging in the House
of an English Woman, where several Merchants lodg'd, some
Trench, two Italians, or rather sews, and one Englishman:
Here I was handsomely enough entertained; and that I
might not be said to run rashly upon any Thing, I sta:d
here above nine Months, considering what Course to take,
and how to manage myself: I had some English Goods
with me of Value, and a considerable Sum of Money,
my Nephew furnishing me with a thousand Pieces of
Eight, and a Letter of Credit for more, if I had Occa-
sion, that I might not be straiten'd whatever might hap-
pen. .
I quickly dispos'd of my Goo Is, and to Advantage too;
and, as I originally intended, I bought here some very
good Diamonds, which, of all other Things, was the most
proper for me; in my Circumstances, because I might
always carry my whole Estate about me.
j After a long Stay here, and many Proposals made for
my Return to England, but none salling to my Mind, the
English Merchant who lodg'd with me, and with whom
1 had contracted an intimate Acquaintance, came to me
one Morning: Countryman, says he, / have a Project to com-
municate to you, which, 'as it suits with my Thoughts, may,
for ought I know, suit with yours also, when you shall have
thoroughly consider'd it.
Here we are posted, say? he, you by Accident, and I by
my own Choice, in a Part os the World very remote from our
own Country; but it is in a Country, where, by us who un-
derstand Trade and Business, a great deal of Money is to be
got: If you will put a thousand Pounds to my thousand Pounds,
we will hire a Ship here, the first we can get to our Minds;
you stmll be Captain, Til be Merchant, and we will go a
Trading Voyage to China; for what should we stand still fort
The whole World is in Motion, rolling round and round; all
the Creatures of God, heavenly Bodies and earthly, are'J>usy
and diligent; Why should we be idle t There are no Drones,
of that Number i
1 l i k ' d his Proposal very well, and the more, because
it seem'd to be express'd with so much good Will, and in
so friendly a Manner: I will not say, but that I might,

by
[17°] I
by my loose and unhing'd Circumstances, be the fitter to
embrace a Proposal for Trade, and indeed for any Thing
else; or, otherwise, Trade was none of my Element: How-
ever, I might perhaps say with some Truth, that if Trade
was not my Element, Rambling was; and no Proposal for
seeing any Part of the World which I had never seen before,
could possibly come amiss to me.
I t was, however, some time before we could get a Ship
to our Minds ,- and when we had got a Vessel, it was not
easy to get English Sailors; that is to say, so many as were
necessary to govern the Voyage, and manage the Sailors
which we should pick up there: After some time we got
a Mate, a Boatswain, and a Gunner, English; a Dutch Car-
penter, and three Potugueze Fore-mast Men; with these,
we found, we could do well enough, having Indian Sea-
men, such as they are, to make up.
T h e r e arc so many Travellers, who have written the
History of their Voyages and Travels this Way, that it
would be but very little Diversion to any body, to give a
long Account of the Places we went to, and the People
who inhabit there: Those Things I leave to others, and
refer the Reader to those Journals and Travels of English-
men, of which, many I find are publish'd, and more pro-
mis'd every Day; 'tis enough for me to tell you, that we
made the Voyage to Achin, in the Island of Sumatra first,
and from thence to Siam, where' we exchang'd some of
our Wares for Opium, and for some Arrack, the first, a
Commodity which bears a great Price among the Chinese,
and which at that Time, was very much wanted there; in
a Word, we went up to Susliam, made a very great Voyage,
was eight Months out, and return'd to Bengae, and I was
very well satisfy'd with my Adventure: I observe, that our
People in England bften admire how the Officers, which
the Company send into India, and the Merchants which
generally stay there, get such very great Estates as they do,
and sometimes come home worth 6o, to 70 and 100 thou-
sand Pounds at a Time.
But it is no Wonder, or at least we shall see so much
sarther into it, when we consider the innumerable Ports
and Places where they have a free Commerce, that it will
then be no Wonder; and much less will it be so, when
we consider; that at all those Places and Ports, where the
'English Ships come, there is so much, and such constant
Eemand for the Growth of all other Countries, that there
is
is a certain Vent for the Return, as well as a Market'
abroad for the Goods carried out.
I n short, we made a very good Voyage, and I got so
much Money by the first Adventure, and such an lnlight
into the Method os getting more, that, had I been twenty
Years younger, I should have been tempted to have staid
here and sought no sarther, for making my Fortune; but
what was all this, to a Man on the wrong Side of three-
score? that was rich enough, and came abroad more in
Obedience to a restless Desire of seeing the World, than a
covetous Desire of getting, in it; and indeed I think, 'tis
with great Justice that I now call it a restless Desire, for
it was so; when I was at home, 1 was restless to go
abroad, and now I was abroad, I was restless to be at
home: I say, What was this Gain to me? I was rich
enough already, nor had I any uneasy Desires about getting
more Money; and therefore, the Profits of the Voyage to
me, were Things of no great Force, for the prompting
me forward to farther Undertakings: Hence I thought,
that by this Vogage I had made no Progress at all ,- be-
cause I was come back as 1 might call it, to the Place
from whence I came, as to a Home; whereas, my Eye,
which like that which Solomon speaks of, was never satis-
fied with seeing, was still more desirous of wandering and
seeing. I was come into a Part of the World, which I
was never in before; and that Part in particular, which I
had heard much of; and was resolv'd to see as much of it
as I could; and then I thought, I might say, I had seen
all the World that was worth seeing.
But my Fellow-Traveller and I had different Notions;
I do not name this, to insist upon my own, for I acknow-
ledge his was the most just, and the most suited to the
End of a Merchant's Lite; who, when he is abroad upon
Adventures, 'tis his Wisdom to stick to that, as the best
Thing for him, which he is like to get the most Money
by: My new Friend kept himself to the Nature of the
Thing, and would have been content to have gone like a
Carrier's Horse, always to the same Inn, backward and
forward, provided he could, as he call'd it, sind Ms Account
in it; on the other Hand, mine, as old as I was, was the
Notion of a mad rambling Boy, that never cares to fee a
Thing twice over.
But this was not all; I had a kind of Impatience
upon me to be nearer home, and yet the most unsettled
H i Reso-
Resolution imaginable, which way to go; in the Interval
of these Consultations, my Friend; who was always upon
the Search for Business, propos'd another Voyage to me,
(viz.) among the Spice-Islands; and to bring home a
Loading of Cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts;
Places where indeed the Dutch do trade, but the Islands,
belong partly to the Spaniards; tho' we went not so sar,
but to some other, where they have not the whole Power
as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &c. We were not long
in preparing for this Voyage; the chief Difficulty was
in bringing me to come into it; i owever, at last nothing
else offering, and finding that really stirring about and Trad-
ing, the Profit being so great, and as I may say, certain,
had more Pleasure in it, and more Satissaction to the Mind,
than sitting still, which, to me especially, was the unhap-
piest Part of Life: I resolv'd on this Voyage too, wh:ch
we made very successfully, touching at Borneo, and several
Islands, whose Names I do not remember, and came home
in about five Months; we fold our Spice, which was chiefly
Cloves and some Nutmegs, to the Perfian Merchants, who
carried them away for the Gulph; and making near five
of one, we really got a great deal of Money,
M y Friend, when we made up this Account sinil'd
at me; Well now, said he, with a Sort of an agreeable In-
sult upon my indolent Temper; is not this better than
walking about here, like a Man of nothing to do, and spend-
ing our Time in staring at the Nonsense and Ignorance os the
Pagans? Why truly, laid I, my Friend, I think it is; and I
begin to be a Convert to the Principles of Merchandizing;
but I must tell you, said I, by the Way, you do not know
what I am a doing, for if once I. conquer my Backwardness,
and imbark heartily, as old as I am, I shall harass you up
and down the World till I tire you ; for I shall pursue it so
eagerly, I shall never let you lie still.
But to be short with my Speculations; a little while
after this, there came in a Dutch Ship from Batavia; she
was a Coaster, not an European Trader, and of about two
hundred Ton Burden: The Men, as they pretended, hav-
ing been so sickly, that the Captain had not Men enough
to go to Sea with, he lay by at Bengal; and as if hav-
ing got Money enough, or being willing for other Rea-
sons to go for Europe, he gave publick Notice that he
would sell his Ship: This came to my Ears .before my
new Partner heard of it; and I had a great mind to buy
it; so I goes home to him, and told him of it; he con-
siders a while, for he was no rash Man neither; but mu-
sing some Time, he reply'd, stic is a little too big, but
however, we will have her: Accordingly we bought the
Ship, and agreeing with the Master, we paid for her, and
took Possession; when we had done so, we resolv'd to en-
tertain the Men if we could, to join them with those we
had, for the pursuing our Business; but on a sudden, they
having received not their Wages, but their Share of the
Money, as we afterwards learnt, not one of them was to
be found: We enquir'd much about them, and at length
were told, that they were all gone together by Land to
Agra, the great City of the Mogul's Residence; and from
thence were to travel to Suratte, and so by Sea, to the
Gulph of Persia.
Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while,
as that I miss'd the Opportunity of going with them; for
such a Ramble, I thought, and in such Company as would
both have guarded me, and diverted me, would have suited
mightily with my great Design; and I should both have
seen the World, and gone homewards too; but I was much
better satisfied a few Days after, when I came to know
what Sort of Fellows they were; for, in short, their History
was, that this Man they call'd Captain, was the Gunner
only, not the Commander; that they had been a Trading
Voyage, in which, they were attack'd on Shore by some
of the Malaeans, who had kill'd the Captain, and three of
his Men; and that after the Captain was kill'd, these Men,
eleven in Number, had resolv'd to run away with the Ship,
which they did; and had brought her in at the Bay of
Bengal, leaving the Mate and five Men more on Shore, of
whom we shill hear sarther.
Well, let them come by the Ship how they would,
we came honestly by her, as we thought; tho' we did not
I confess, examine into|Things so exactly as we ought, for
we never enquired any Thing of the Seamen; who, if we
had examin'd, would certainly have saulter'd in their Ac*
counts, contradicted one another, and perhaps contradicted
themselves; or one how or other, we should have seen
Reason to have suspected them; but the Man shew'd us
a Bill of Sale for the Ship, to one Emanuel Clofierfioven,
or some such Name; for I suppose it was all a Forgery,
and calld himself by that Name, and we could not con-
tradict him; and being witha] a little too unwary, or at
H 3 leaO
least, having no Suspicion of the Thing, we went through
with our Bargain.
However we pick'd up some English Seamen here
after this, and some Dutch; and now we resolv'd for a
second Voyage to the South-East for Cloves, &c. that is to
fay, among the Philippine and Malaca Isles,- and, ia
short, not to fill this Part of my Story with Trifles, when
what is yet to come is so remarkable; I spent from first
to last, six Years in this Country, trading from Port to Port,
backward and forward, and with very good Success; and
was now the last Year with my Partner, going in the Ship
abovemention'd, on a Voyage to China; but designing first
to Siam, to buy Rice.
I n this Voyage, being by contrary Winds oblig'd to
beat up and down a great while in the Straits of Malaca,
and among the Islands; we were no sooner got clear of
those difficult Seas, but we found our Ship had sprung a
Leak, and we weie not able by all our Industry to find out
where it was: This fore'd us to make for some Port, and
my Partner, who knew the Country better than I did, di-
rected the Captain to put into the River of Cambodia, for
1 had made the English Mate, one Mr. Thompson, Captain,
not being willing to take the Charge of the Ship upon myself:
This River lies on the North Side of the great Bay or Gulph,
which goes up to Siam.
While we were here, and going often on Shore for
Refreshment, there comes to me one Day an .Englishman,
and he was it seems a Gunner's Mate, on board an English
East-India Ship, which rode in the lame River, up at, or
near the City of Cambodia; what brought him hither we
knew not; but he comes up to me, and speaking English:
Sir, fays he, you are a Stranger to me, and I to you; but
I have something to tell you, that very nearly concerns
you.
I look'd steadily at him a good while, and he thought
at first I had known him, but I did not; If it very nearly
concerns me, faid I, and not yourself, what moves you to
tell it me1 I am moved, fays he, by the eminent Danger
you are in, and for ought I fee, you have no Knowledge
of it; I know tie Danger I am in, laid I, but that my Ship
is leaky4 and I cannot find it out; but I propose to lay her
a Ground To-morrow, to see if I can find it. But, Sir,
fays he, leaky, or not leaky, find it or not find it, you toill
be wiser than to lay your Ship on Shore To-morrow, when
you
you hear what I have to say to you; do you know, Sir, said
he, the Town of Cambodia lies about fifteen Leagues us
this River? and there are two large English Ship about
five Leagues on this Side, and three Dutch. Well, said I,
and what is that to me? Why, Sir, says he, is it for a Man
that is upon such Adventures as you are uf on. to come into.
a Port, and not examine first what Ships there are there,
and whether he is able to deal with them? I suppose you
don't think you are a Match for them. I was amused very
much at his Discourse, but not amaz'd at it, for I could
not conceive what he meant; and I turn'd short upon him,
avd said, Sir, I wish you would explain your self; I cannot
imagine what Reason I have to be afraid of any ef the Com-
pany's Ships, or Dutch Ships; I am no Interloper, what can
they ihave to say to me}
H e look'd like a Man half angry, half pleas'd, and pau-
sing a while, but smiling; well, Sir, says he, if you think
yourself secure, you must take your Chance; I am sorry
your Fate should blind you against good Advice; but assure
yourself, if you do not put to Sea immediately, you will
the very next Tide be attack'd by five long Boats full of
Men, and perhaps, if you are takes, you'll be hang'd for a
Pirate, and the Particulars beexamin'd afterwards: I thought
Sir;, added he, I should have met with a better Reception
than this for doing you a Piece of Sefvice of soch Impor-
tance. I can never be ungrateful, said I, for any Service,
or to any Man that offers me any Kindness, but it is past
my Comprehension, said I, what'they should have such a
Design upon me for* however, since you say, there is no
Time to be lost, and that there is some villainous Design
in hand against me, I'll go on board this Minute, and put
to Sea immediately, if my Men can stop the Leak, or if
we can swim without stopping it; But, Sir, said I, shall I
go away ignorant of the Reason of all this? Can you give
me no sarther Light into it?
I can tell you but Part of the Story, Sir, says he; but
I have a Dutch Seaman here with me, and I believe I could
persuade him to tell you the rest; but there is scarce Time
for it: But the short of the Story is this, the first Part of
which, I suppose, you know well enough, (viz.) that you
was with this Ship at Sumatra; that there your Captain was
murder'd by the Malacans, with three ot' his Men; and
that you, or some of those that were on board with you,
ran away with the Ship, and are since turn'd PIRATES;
H 4 this
this is the Sum of the Story, and you will be all seiz.'d as
Pirates, I can aflurc you; and executed with very little
Ceremony; for you know, Merchmts Ships shew but Httlc
Law to Pirates, if they get them in their Power.
Now you speak plain English, said I, and I thank you;
and though I know nothing, that we have done, like what
you talk of, but am sure we came honestly and sairly by
the Ship, yet seeing such Work is a doing as you say, and
that you seem to mean honestly, I'll be upon my Guard.
Nay, Sir, says he, do not talk of being upon your Guard;
the best Defence is to be out of the Danger; if you have any
Regard to your Life, and the Life of all your Men, put
out to Sea without fail at High-water, and as you have a
whole Tide before you, you will be gone too sar out before,
they can come down, for they will come away at High-
water, and as they have twenty Miles to come, you get
rear two Hours of them, by the Difference of the Tide,
not reckoning the Length of the Way; besides, as they arc
only Boats, and not Ships, they will not venture to follow
you sar out to Sea, especially if it blows.
Well, says I, you have been very kind in this, what
shall I do for you, to make you Amends? Sir, says he,
you may not be so willing to make me any Amends, be-
cause you may not be convine'd of the Truth of it: I'll
make an Offer to you; I have nineteen Months Pay due
to me on board the Ship , which I came out of
England in; and the Dutchman, that is with me, has seven
Months Pay due to him; if you will make good our Pay
to us, we will go along with you; if you find nothing L
more in it, we will desire no more; but if we do con-
vince you, that we have sav'd your Lives, and the Ship,
and the Lives of all the Men in her, we will leave the rest
to you.
I consented to this readily, and went immediately
on board, and the two Men with me; as soon as I came
to the Ship Side, my Partner who was on board, came out
on the Quarter-Deck, and call'd to me with a great deal of
Joy, O ho! Oho! we have sloff'd the Leak! we have slopp'd
the Leak! Say you so, said I, thank God, but weigh the
Anchor then immediately: Weigh!says he: What do you
mean by that? What is the matter, says he? Ask no Que-
stions, jays I, but all Hands to work, and weigh, without
losing a Minute: He was siirpriz'd, but however, he call'd
the Captain, and he immediately order'd the Anchor to be
go:
got up ; and tfio' the Tide was not quite done, yet a little
Land-breeze blowing, we stood out to Sea; then I call'd
him into the Cabin, and told him the Story at large, and
we call'd in the Men, and they told us the rest of it; but
as it took us up a great deal of time, so before we had done,
a Seaman comes to the Cabin Door, and calls out to us, that
the Captain bad him tell us, we were chas'd; Chas'd, says
I, by who, and by what? By five Sloops or Boats, said
the Fellow, full of Men. Very well, said I, then it is ap-
parent there is something in it: In the next Place, I or-
der'd all our Men to be call'd up, and told them, that there
was a Design to seise the Ship, and to take us for Pirates,
and ask'd them, if they would stand by us, and by one
another? The Men answer'd chearfully, that one and all,
they would live and die with us: Then I ask'd theCaptain,
what way he thought best for us to manage a Fight with
them? For resist them I resolv'd we would, and that to
the last Drop; he did readily, That the way was to keep
them off with our great Shot, as long as we could, and
then to fire at them with our small Arms, to keep them
from boarding us; but when neither of these would do
any longer, we should retire to our close Quarters; per-
haps they had not Materials to break open our Bulk-heads,
or get in upon us.
The Gunner had in the mean time order, to bringtwo
Guns to bear fore and aft, out of the Steerage, to cleat
the Deck, and load them with Musket-Bullets and small
Pieces of old Iron, and what next came to hand, and thus
we made ready for Fight; but all this while kept out to
Sea, with Wind enough, and could fee the Boats at a Di-
stance, being five large long Boats following us, with aU
the Sail they could make.
Two of these Boats, which by our Glasses we could
see, were English, had outfailed the rest, were near two
Leagues a-head of them, and gain'd upon us considerably;
so that we found they would come up with us; upon
which we fired a Gun without a Shot, to intimate, that
they should bring to, and we put out a Flag of Truce, as
a Signal for Parley; but they kept crouding after us, till
they came within Shot: Upon this we took in our white
Flag, they having made no Answer to it, hung out a red
Flag, and fired at them with a Shot; notwithstanding this,
they came on till they were near enough to call to them
H f with
with a speaking Trumpet, which we had on board; so we
call'd to them, and bad them keep off at their Peril.
I t was all one, they crouded after us, and endeavoured
to come under our Stern, so to board us on our Quarter;
upon which, seeing they were resolute for Mischief, and
depended upon the Strength that follow'd them, I order'd
to bring the Ship to, so that they lay upon our Broad-
side, when immediately we fired five Guns at them; one
of which, had been levelled so true. as to carry away the
Stern of the hindermost Boat, and bring them to the Ne-
cessity of taking down their Sail, and running all to the
Head of the Boat to keep her from, sinking, so she lay
by, and had enough of it; but seeing the foremost Boat
crowd still on after us, we made ready to fire at her in
particular.
While this was doing, one of the three Boats that
was behind, being forwarder than the other twa, made up
to the Boat which we had disabled, to relieve her, and we
could afterwards fee her take out the Men; we call'd again
to the foremost Boat, and offer'd a Truce to parley again,
and to know what was her Business with us; but had no
Answer, only she crouded close under our Stern; upon
this, our Gunner, who was a very dextrous Fellow, run
out his two Chace-Guns, and fir'd again at her; but the
Shot missing, the Men in the Boat shouted, wav'd their
Caps, and came on; but the Gunner getting quickly ready
again. fir'd among them the second Time; one Shot ot
which, though it miss'd the Boat itself, yet fell in among
the Men, and we could easily see, had done a great deal of
Mischief among them; but we taking no Notice of thar,
war'd the Ship again, and brought our Quarter to bear up-
on them; and firing three Guns more, we found the Boat
was split almost to Pieces; in particular, her Rudder, and
a Piece of her Stern was shot quite away, so they handed
their Sail immediately, and were in great Disorder; but to
complete their Misfortune, our Gunner let fly two Guns
at them again; where he hit them,we could not tell, but
we found the Boat was sinking, and some of the Men al-
ready in the Water; upon this I immediately mann'd out
our Pinnace, which we had kept close by our Side, with
Orders to pick up some of the Men if they could, and
five them from drowning, and immediately to come on
board with them; because we saw the rest of the Boats
began to come up; our Men in the Pinnace follow'd their
- Orders,
Orders, and took up three Men; one of which was just
drowning, and it was a good while before we could recover
him ; as loon as they were on board, we crouded all the
Sail we could make, and stood farther out to Sea, and we
found that when the other three Boats came up to the first
two, they gave over their Chace. i'
Being thus deliver'd from a Danger, which though T
knew not the Reason of it, yet seem'd to be much greater
than I apprehended; I took Care that we would change
our Course, and not let any one imagine whither we were
going; so we stood out to Sea Eastward, quite out of the
Course of all European Ships, whether they were bound to
China, or any where else, within the Commerce of the
European Nations.
When we were now at Sea, we began to consult with
the two Seamen, and enquire first, What the Meaning of
all this should be. The Dutchman let us into the Secret
of it at once; telling us, that the Fellow that fold us the
Ship, as we said, was no more than a Thief, that had run
away with her: Then he told us how the Captain, whose
Name too he told us, though I do not remember it now,
was treacherously murder'd by the Natives on the Coast
of Malaca, with three of his Men; and that he, this Dutch-
man, and four more got into the Woods, where they wan-
dered about a great while; 'till at length, he in particular,
in a miraculous Manner, made his Escape, and swam off
to a Dutch Ship, which failing near the Shore, in its Way
from China, had sent their Boat on Shore for fresh Water;
that he durst not come to that Part of the Shore where
the Boat was, but made shist in the Night, to take into
the Water farther off, and swimming a great while, at last
the Ship's Boat took him up.
H e then told us, that he went to Batavia, where two
of the Seamen belonging to the Ship had arriv'd, having
deserted the rest in their Travels, and gave an Account,
that the Fellow who had run away with the Ship, sold her
at Bengal, to a set or Pirates, which were gone a Cruising
in her; and that they had already taken an English Ship, ar.d
two Dutch Ships very richly laden.
This latter Part, we found to concern us directly, and
tho' we knew it to be false; yet, as my Partner faid very
well, if we had fallen into their Hands, and they had had
such a Prepossession against us before-hand, it had been in
vain for us to have defended ourselves, or to hope for any
H 6 good
good Quarters at their Hands; especially considering that our
Accusers had been our Judges, and that we could have ex-
pected nothing from them; but what Rage would have
dictated, and ungoverned Passion have executed $ and
therefore it was his Opinion, we should go directly back
to B.ngal, from whence we came, without putting in at
any Port whatever; because there, we could give an Ac-
count of ourselves, and could prove where we were when
the Ship put in, who we bought her of, and the like;
and, which was more than all the rest, if we were put
to the Necessity of bringing it before the proper Judges,
we should lie sure to have some Justice, and not be hang'd
first, and judg'd afterward. .
I w as some time of my Partner's Opinion; but after a
little more serious thinking, I told him, I thought it was
a very great Hazard for us to attempt returning to Ben-
gal, for that we were on the wrong Side of the Straits
of Malaca; and that if the Alarm was given, we should
be sure to be way-laid on every side, as well by the Dutch
of Bata-via, as the English elsewhere; that if we should
be taken, as it were, running away, we should even con-
demn ourselves, and there would want no more Evidence
to destroy us; I also asked the English Sailor's Opinion,
who said, he was of my Mind, and that we should cer-
tainly be taken.
This Danger a little startled my Partner, and all the
Ship's Company; and we immediately resolved to go
away to the Coast of Tenquin, and so on to China, and
from thence pursuing the first Design, as to Trade, find
some way or other to dispose of the Ship, and come back
in some of the Vessels of the Country, such as we could
get. This was approved of as the best Method for our Se-
curity ; and accordingly we steer'd away N. N. E. keeping
above fifty Leagues off from the usual Course to the East-
ward.' . i
This however put us to some Inconveniencies 5 for first
the Winds, when we came to that Distance from the
Shore, seem'd to be more steadily against us, blowing al-
most Trade, as wt call it, from the East, and E. N. E. so
that we were a long while upon our Voyage, and we were
but ill provided with Victuals for so long a Run; and,
which was still worse, there was some Danger^ that those
English and Dutch Ships, whose Boats pursued us, whereof
some were bound that way, might be got in; before us %
.. . and
and if not, some other Ship, bound to China, might have
Information of us from them, and pursue us with the
fame Vigour.
I must confess, I was now very uneasy, and thought
myself, including the late Escape from the Long-Boats,
to have been in the most dangerous Condition that ever I
was in, thro' all my past Life; for whatever ill Circum-
stances I had been in, I was never pursued for a Thief be-
fore; nor had I ever done any Thing that merited the
Name of dishonest, or fraudulent, much less thievish. I had
chiefly been mine own Enemy, or, as I may rightly say,
I had been no body's Enemy but my own. But now I
was embarass'd in the worst Condition imaginable; for
though I was perfectly innocent, I was in no Condition to
make that Innocence appear. And if I had been taken,
it had been under a supposed Guilt of the worst Kind;
at least, a Crime esteem'd so among the People I had to
do with.
This made me very anxious to make an Escape, tho'
which way to do it, I. knew not; or what Port or Place
we should go to. My Partner seeing me thus dejected,
tho' he was the most concern'd at first, began to encourage
me; and describing to me the several Ports of that Coast,
told me he would put in, on the Coast of Chochinchina, or
the Bay of Tonquin; intending to go afterwards to Macao,
a Town once in the Possession of the Portugueze, and where
still a great many European Families resided, and particu-
larly the Missionary Priests usually went thither, in order
to their going forward to China.
Hither then we resolved to go; and accordingly,
tho' after a tedious and irregular Course, and very much
straitned for Provisions, we came within Sight of the Coast
very early in the Morning; and upon Reflection upon the
past Circumstances we were in, and the Danger if We had
not escaped, we resolv'd to put into a small River, which,
however, had a Depth enough of Water for us, and to see
if we could, either over Land, or by the Ship's Pinnace
come to know what Ships were in any Port thereabouts.
This happy Step was indeed our Deliverance; for though
we did not immediately see any European Ships in the Bay
of Tonquin, yet the next Morning, there eame into the Bay
two Dutch Ships, and a third without any Colours spread
out, but which we believ'd to be a Dutchman, pass'd by
at about two Leagues Distance, steering for the Coast of
.' ' . China $

Chin*; and in the Afternoon went by two English Ships,
steering the same Course; and thus, we thought, we saw
ourselves beset with Enemies, both one way and the
other. The Place we were in was wild and barbarous, the
People Thieves, even by Occupation or Profession; and
tho' it is true, we had not much to seek or them, and ex-
cept getting a few Provisions, car'd not how little we had
to do with them, yet it was with much Difficulty, that
we kept ourselves from being insulted by them several
ways.
We were in a small River of this Country, within a
few Leagues of its utmost Limits Northward ; and by our
Boat we coasted North-east to the Point of Land, which
opens the great Bay of Tonquin; and it was in this Beating
up along the Shore, that we discover'd as above, that, in a
Word, we were surrounded with Enemies. The People we
were among, were the most barbarous of all the Inhabi-
tants of the Coast; having no Correspondence with any
other Nation, and dealing only in Fish, and Oil, and such
gross Commodities; and it may be particularly seen, that
they are, as I said, the most barbarous of any of the Inha-
bitants, (viz.) that among other Customs they have this as
one, That if any Vessel have the Misfortune to be Ship-
vreck'd upon their Coast, they presently make the Men all Pri-
soners, that is to say, Slaves; and it was not long before ve
found a Spice of their Kindness this nay; on the Occasion
following:
I have observed above, that our Ship sprung a Leak
at Sea, and that we could not find it out; and however,
-it happen'd, that as I have said, it was stopp'd unexpec-
tedly, in the happy Minute of our being to be seized, by
the Dutch and English Ships, near the Bay Of Siam; yet as
we did not find the Ship so perfectly tight and sound as
we desir'd, we resolv'd, while we were in this Place, to
lay her on Shore, take out what heavy Things we had on
board, which were not many, and to wash and clean her
Bottom; and, if possible, to find out where the Leaks
were. 1.' .
Accordingly, having lightned the Ship, and
brought all our Guns, and other moveable Things to one
side, we try'd to bring her down, that we might come at
her Bottom; for oa second Thoughts, we did not care to
lay her dry a-ground, neither could we nod out a proper
Place for it.
s 182 3

S
The Inhabitants who had never been acquainted with
such a Sight, came wondering down to the Shore, to look at
us; and seeing the Ship lie down on one Side in such a
Manner, and heeling towards the Shore, and not seemg
our Men, who were at work on her Bottom with Stages,
and with their Boats on the Oft-side, they presently con-
cluded, that the Ship was cast away, and lay so very fast
on the Ground.
O n this Supposition, they came all about us in two or
three Hours time, with ten or twelve large Boats, having
some of them eight, some ten Men in a Boat, intending,
no doubt, to have come on board, and plunder'd the Ship,
and if they had found us there, to have carry'd us away
for Slaves to their King; or whatever they call him, for.
we knew nothing who was their Governor.
When they came up to the Ship, and began to row
round her, they discover'd us all hard at work, on the
Outside of the Ship's Bottom and Side, washing, and
graving, and stopping, as every Sea-faring Man knows
how.
They stood for a while gating at us, and we, who
were a little surpriz'd, could not imagine what their De-
sign was; but being willing to be sure, we took this Op-
portunity, to get some of us into the Ship, and others to
hand down Arms and Ammunition to those that were at
work, to defend themselves with, if there should be Oc-
casion; and it was no more than need; for, in less than
a Quarter of an Hour's Consultation, they agreed, it seems,
that the Ship was really a Wreck, that we were all at
work, endeavouring to fave her, or to fave our Lives by
the Help of our Boats, and when we handed our Arms
into the Boats, the concluded by that Motion, that we
were endeavouring to fave some of our Goods; upon this
they took it for granted, they all belong'd to them; and
away they came directly upon our Men, as if it had beea
in a Line of Battle.
Our Men, seeing so many of them, began to be fright-
ed; for we lay but in an ill Posture to fight, and cry'd out
to us, to know what they should do? I immediately call'd
to the Men, who work'd upon the Stages to flip them
down, and get up the Side into the Ship; and bad those
in the Boat to row round and come on board; and those
sew of us. who were on board, work'd with all the Strength
and Hands we had, to bring the Ship to rights; but how-
ever, neither the Men upon the Stage, nor those in the
Boats, could do as they were order'd, before the Cochin-
eh'meses were upon them; and with two of their Boats
boarded our Long-boat, and began to lay hold of the Men
as their Prisoners.
The first Man they laid hold of, was an English Sea-
man, a stout strong Fellow, who having a Musket in his
Hand, never offer'd to fire it, but laid it down in the
Boat, like a Fool, as I thought: But he understood his Busi-
ness better than I could teach him, for he grappled the
Pagan, and dragg'd him by main Force, out of their own
Boat into ours; where, taking him by the two Ears, he
beat his Head so against the Boats Gunnel, that the Fellow
dy'd instantly in his Hands; and in the mean Time, a
Dutchman, who stood next, took up the Musket, and with
the But-end of it, so laid about him, that he knock'd down
five of them, who attempted to enter the Boat; but this
was doing little towards resisting thirty or forty Men, who
fearless, because ignorant of their Danger, began to throw
themselves into the Long-boat, where we had but five
Men to defend it: But one Accident gave our Men a com-
plete Victory, which deserv'd our Laughter rather than any
thing else, and that was this:
Our Carpenter, being preparing to grave the Outside
of the Ship, as well as to pay the Seams, where he had
caulk'd her to stop the Leaks, had got two Kettles just let
down into the Boat; one fill'd with boiling Pitch, and the
other with Rosin, Tallow, and Oil, and such Stuff as the
Shipwrights use for that Work; and the Man that tended
the Carpenter, had a great Iron Ladle in- his Hand, with
which he fupply'd the Men that were at work with that
hot Stuff; two of the "Enemy's Men enter'd the Boat just
where this Fellow stood, being in the Fore-sheets, he im-
mediately saluted them with a Ladleful of the Stuff, boil-
ing hot, which so burnt and scalded them, being half na-
ked, that they roar'd out like two Bulls, and, enrag'd with
the Fire. leap'd both into the Sea: 'The Carpenter saw it,
and cry'd out, Well done,. j^ack, give them some more of
k; when stepping forward himself, he takes one of their
Mops, and dipping it in the Pitch Pot, he and his Man
threw it among them so plentifully, that, in short, of all
the Men in three Boats, there was not one that was not
icaldcd, and burnt with it in a most frightful pitiful Man-
ner,
i i85]
ner, and made such a howling and crying, that I never
heard a worse Noise, and indeed nothing like it; for it is
worth observing, That tho" Pain naturally makes all Peo-
ple cry out, yet every Nation have a particular way of
Exclamation, and make Noises as different from one ano-
ther, as their Speech. I cannot give the Noise these
Creatures made, a better Name than howling, nor a
Name more proper to the Tone of it; for I never heard
any thing more like the Noise of the Wolves, which, as I
have said, I heard howl in the Forest on the Frontiers of
Languedoc.
1 was never pleas'd with a Victory better in my Life}
not only as it was a perfect Surprize to me, and that our
Danger was imminet before: But as we got this Vic-
tory without any Bloodshed, except of that Man the Fel-
low kill'd with his naked Hands, and which I was very
much concern'd at; for I was fick of killing such poor
Savage Wretches, even tho' it was in my own Defence,
knowing they came on Errands, which they thought just,
and knew no better; and that tho" it may be a just Thing,
because necessary, for there is no necessary Wickedness in
Nature; yet I thought it was a sad Life, when we must
be always oblig'd to be killing our Fellow-Greatures to
preserve ourselves, and indeed, I think so still; and I would
even now suffer a great deal, rather than I would take
away the Life even of the worst Person injuring me: I be-
lieve also, all considering People, who know the Value of
Life, would be of my Opinion, if they enter'd seriously
into the Consideration of it.
But to return to my Story; all the while this was do-
ing, my Partner and I, who manag'd the rest of the Men
on board, had with great Dexterity brought the Ship al-
most to rights; and having gotten the Guns into their
Places again, the Gunner call'd to me, to bid our Boat get
out of the way, for he would let fly among them: I call'd
back again to him, and bid him not offer to fire, for the
Carpenter would do the Work without him; but bad him
heat another Pitch-Kettle, which our Cook, who was on
board, took care off: But the Enemy was so terrified with
what they met with in their first Attack, that they would
not come on again; and some of them that were sarthest
off, seeing the Ship swim, as it were upright, begun, as
we suppos'd, to see their Mistake, and give over the En-
terprise, finding it was not as they expected: Thus we
got
got clear of this merry Fight; and having gotten somr
Rice, and some Roots, and Bread, with about sixteen good
big Hogs on board, two Days before, we resolv'd to stay
here no longer, but go forward, whatever came of it; for
we made no doubt but we should be surrounded the next
Day with Rogues enough, perhaps more than our Pitch-
Kettle would dispose of for us.
W e therefore got all our Things on board the fame
Evening, and the next Morning was ready to sail; in the
mean time, lying at an Anchor some Distance from the
Shore, we were not fb much concern'd, being now in a
fighting Posture, as well as in a sailing Posture, if any
Enemy had presented. The next Day having finish'd our
Work within board, and finding our Ship was perfectly
heard of all her Leaks, we set sail; we would have gone
into the Bay of Tonquin; for we wanted to inform ourselves
of what was to be known concerning the Dutch Ships that
had been there; but we durst not stand in there, because
we had seen several Ships go in, as we supposed, but a lit-
tle before; so we kept on N. E. towards the Isle of For-
mosa, as much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or English
Merchant Ship, as a Dutch or English Merchant Ship in the
Mediterranean is of an Algerin* Man of War. . /-...
When we were thus got to Sea, we kept on N. E. as
if we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine Islands;
and this we did that we might not sall into the way of
any of the European Ships; and then we steer'd North
again, till we came to the Latitude of a1 Degrees, io
Minutes; by which means we made the Island of Formosa
directly, where we came to an Anchor, in order to get
Water, and fresh Provisions, which the People there, who
are very courteous and civil in their Manners, supply'd us
with willingly, and dealt very sairly and punctually with
us in all their Agreements and Bargains; which is what we
did not find among other People; and may be owing to
the Remains of Christianity, which was once planted here
by a Dutch Missionary of Protestants, and is a Testimony
of what I have often observ'd, vixi. That the Christian
Religion always civilizes the People, and reforms their
Manners, where it is receiv'd, whether it works saving
Effects upon them or no.
Fiom hence we sail'd still North, keeping the Coast of
China at an equal Distance, till we knew we were beyond
all the Ports of China, where our European Ships usually
come;
come; being resolv'd, if possible, not to fall into any of
their Hands, especially in this Country, where, as our Cir-
cumstances were, we could not fail of being entirely ruined;
nay, so great was my Fear in particular, as to my being
taken by them, that I believe firmly, I would much ra-
ther have chosen to fall into the Hands of the Spanish In-
quisition.
Being now come to the Latitude of 30 Degrees, we
resolved to put into the first Trading Port we should come
at ; and standing in for the Shore, a Boat came off two
Leagues to us, with an old Portuguese Pilot on board, who
knowing us to be an European Ship, came to offer his Ser-
vice, which indeed we were very glad of, and took him
on board; upon which, without asking us, whither we
would go, he dismiss'd the Boat he came in, and sent it
back.
I thought it was now so much in our Choice, to
make the old Man carry us whither we would, that I be-
gan to talk with him about carrying of us to the Gulph
of Nanquin, which is the most Northern Part of the Coast
of China : The old Man faid he knew the Gulph of Nan-
quin very well; but, smiling, ask'd us what we would do
there. . i i s"
I told him, we would fell our Cargo, and purchase
C&»/»-Wares, Callicoes, . Raw-Silks, Tea, Wrought Silks,
&c. and so would return by the fame Course we came.
He told us our best Port had been to have put in at Ma-
cao, where we could not fail of a Market for our Opium,
to our Satisfaction, and might for our Money have pur-
chased all Sorts of China-Goods, as cheap as we could at
Nanquin.
Not being able to put the old Man out of his Talk, of
which he was very opinionated, or conceited, I told him,
we were Gentlemen, as well as Merchants, and that we
had a Mind to go and see the great City of Piking, and
the famous Court of the Monarch of China. Why then,
fays the old Man, you should go to Ningpo, where, by the
River which runs into the Sea there, you may go up
within five Leagues of the Great Canal. This Canal is a
navigable made Stream, which goes through the Heart ot
that vast Empire of China, crosses all the Rivers, passes
some considerable Hills, by the Help of Sluices and Gates,
and goes up to the City of Peking, being in Length near
270 Leagues.
Well,
Well, said I, Seignior Portuguese, but that is not our
Business now: The grea' Question is, If you can carry us
up to the City of Nanquin, from whence we can travel to
Pecking afterwards ? Yes, he said, he could do fo very
well, and there was a great Dutch Ship gone up that Way
just before. This gave me a little Shock; a Dutch Ship
was now our Terror, and we had much rather have met
the Devil, at least, if he had not come in too frightful a
Figure; we depended upon it, that a Dutch Ship would
be our Destruction, for we were in no Condition to fight
them; all the Ships they trade with in those Parts being
of great Burthen, and of much greater Force than we
were.
The old Man found me a little confused, and under
some Concern, when he nam'd a Dutch Ship, and said to
me, Sir, you need be under no Apprehension of the Dutch,
I suppose they are not now at War with your Nation,
No, says I, that's true; but I know not what Liberties
Men may take, when they are out of the Reach of the
Laws of their own Country. Why, says he, you are no
Pirates, what need you fear? They will not meddle with
peaceable Merchants sure.
I f I had any Blood in my Body that did not fly up into
my Face at that Word, it was hinder'd by some Stop in
the Vessels, appointed by Nature to circulate it; for it pot
me into the greatest Disorder and Confusion imaginable;
nor wat it possible for me to conceal it so, but that the
old Man easily perceiv'd it.
S i r, says he, I find you are in some Disorder in your
Thoughts at my Talk; pray be p'eased to go which Way
you think fit, and depend upon it, I'll do you all the Ser-
vice I can. Why, Seignior, said I, it is true, I am a little
unsettled in my Resolution at this Time, whither to go in
particular, and I am something more so, for what you
said about Pirates; I hope there are no Pirates in these
Seas; we are but in an ill Condition to meet with them,
for you see we have but a small Force, and but very
weakly mann'd.
O, Sir, says he, do not be concerned, I do not know
that there has been any Pirates in these Seas these fifteen
Years, except one which was seen, as I hear, in the Bay
ot Siatn, about a Month since; but you may be assured
(he is gone to the Southward; nor was slie a Ship of any
great Force, or fit for the Work; she was not built for a
t Pri-
Privateer, but was run away with by a Reprobate Crew
that were on Board, after the Captain and some of his
Men had been murdered by the Malacans, at or near the
Island of Sumatra.
What! SAID I, seeming to know nothing of the Mat-
ter, Did they murder the Captain ? No, said he, I do not
understand that they murdered him; but as they after-
wards run away with the Ship, it is generally believ'd they
betray'd him into the Hands of the Malacans, who did
murder him, and perhaps they procur'd them to do it.
Why then, said I, they deserve Death as much as if they
had done it themselves. Nay, says the old Man, they do
deserve it, and they will certainly have it, if they light
upon any English or Dutch Ship; for they have all agreed
together, that if they meet that Rogue, they will give
him no Quarter.
But, said I to him, you say the Pirate is gone out of
these Seas, how can they meet with him then? Why, that
is true, sap he, they do say so; but he was as I tell you,
in the Bay of Siam, in the River Cambodia, and was dis-
covered there by some Dutch Men who belong'd to th«
Ship, and who were left on Shore- when they run away
with her; and some English and Dutch Traders being in the
River, they were within a little of taking him: Nay, said
he, if the foremost Boats had been well seconded by the
rest, they. had certainly taken him} but he finding only two
Boats within Reach of him, tack'd about and fir'd at these
two, and disabled them, before the other came up, and
then standing off to Sea, the other were not able to follow
him, and so he got away: But they have all so exact a
Description of the Ship, that they will be sore to know
him; and wherc-ever they find him, they have vow'd to
give no Quarter to either the Captain, or the Seamen, but
to hang them all up at the Yard-Arm.
What! said I, will they execute them right or wrong,
hang them first, and judge them afterwards? O, Sir! says
the old Pilot, there's no need to make a formal Business of
it with such Rogues as those, let them tie them. Back
to Back, and set them a diving ; it is no more than they
rightly deserve.
I knev I had my old Man sast aboard, and that he
could do me no vHarm; so that I turn'd short upon him:
Well, now, Seignior, said I, and this is the very Reason,
why I would have you carry us up to Nanquin, and not
to
to put back to Macao, or to any other Part of the Coun-
try, where the English or Dutch Ships come; for, be it
known to you, Seignior, those Captains of the English and
Dutch Ships, are a Parcel of rash, proud, insolent Fellows,
that neither know what belongs to Justice, or how to be-
have themselves, as the Laws of God and Nature direct;
but being proud of their Offices, and not understanding
their Power, they would act the Murderers to punish
Robbers; would take upon them to insult Men salfly
accused, and determine them guilty without due Inquiry;
and perhaps I may live to call some of them to an Account
for it, where they may be taught how Justice is to be
executed, and that no Man ought to be treated as a Cri-
minal, till some Evidence may be had of the Crime, and
that he is the Man.
With this I told him, that this was the very Ship they
had attack'd, and gave him a full Account of the Skirmish
we had with their Boats, and how foolishly and coward-like
they behav'd: I told him all the Story of our buying the
Ship, and how the Dutchmen served us: I told him the
Reasons I had to believe that this Story of killing the Ma-
ster by the Malacans was true; as also the running away
with the Ship; but that it was all a Fiction of their own,
to suggest that the Men were turn'd Pirates; and they
ought to have been sore it was so, before they had ven-
tur'd to attack us by Surprize, and oblige us to resist 'em;
adding that they would have the Blood of those Men, who
we kill'd there in our just Defence, to answer for.
The old Man was amaz'd at this Relation, and told us,
we were very much in the right to go away to the North,
and that if he might advise us, it should be to sell the Ship
in China, which we might very well do, and buy or build
another in the Country; and, said he, though you will not
get so good a Ship, yet you may get one able enough to
carry you and all your Goods back again to Bengal, or
any where else.
I told him, I would take his Advice, when I came
to any Port where I could find a Ship for my Turn, or
get any Customer to buy this. He reply'd, I should meet
with Customers enough for the Ship at Nanquin, and that
a Chinese Junk would serve me very well to go back
again; and that he would procure me People, both to buy
one, and sell the other.
Well,
Well, but Seignior, fays I, as you fay they know the
Ship so well, I may perhaps, if I follow your Measures, be in-
strumental to bring some honest innocent Men into a terrible
Broil, and perhaps be murdered in cold Blood; for wherever
they find the Ship, they will prove the Guilt upon the Men,
by proving this was the Ship; and so innocent Men may pro-
bably be overpovoer'd and murder'd. Why, fays the old Man,
I'll find out a Was to prevent that also; for as I know all
those Commanders you speak of very well, and shall see them
all as they pass by, I will be sure to set them to rights in the
Thing, and let them know that they had been so much in the
wrong, that though the People who were on board at first,
might run away with the Ship, yet it was not true that they
had turned Pirates; and that in particular those were not
the Men that first went off with the Ship, but innocently
bought her for their Trade; and I am persuaded they will so
sar believe me, as at least to act more cautiously for the time
to come. Well, fays I, and will you deliver one Message to
them from me* Yes I will, fays he, if you will give it
under your Hand in Writing, that I may be able to prove it
came from you, and not out of my own Head. I answered
that I would readily give it him under my Hand. So I took
a Pen, and Ink, and Paper, and wrote at large the Story
of asfaulting me with the long Boats, &c. the pretended
Reason of it, and the unjust cruel Design of it; and con-
cluded to the Commanders, that they had done what
they not only should have been asham'd of, but also, that
if ever they came to England, and I liv'd to see them
there, they should all pay dearly for it, if the Laws of
my Country were not grown out of Use before I arrived
there.
M y old Pilot read this over and over again, and ask'd
me several Times if I would stand to it? I anfwer'd, I
would stand to it as long as I had any thing left in the
World, being sensible that I should one time or other find
an Opportunity to put it home to them. But we had no
Occasion ever to let the Pilot carry this Letter; for he
never went back again. While those Things were passing
between us, by way of Discourse, we went forward di-
rectly for Nanquin, and in about 13 Days fail came to an
Anchor at the South-West Point of the great Gulph of
Nanquin; where, by the Way, I came by accident to un-
derstand, that the two Dutch Ships were gone that length
before me, and that I should certainly fall into their Hands:
I consulted my Partner again in this Exigency, and he was
as much at a Loss as I was, and would very gladly have
been safe on Shore almost any where; however, I was not
in such Perplexity neither, but I ask'd the old Pilot, if there
was no Creek or Harbour, which I might put into, and
pursue my Business with the Chinese privately, and be in
no Danger of the Enemy? He told me if I would sail to
the Southward about two and forty Leagues, there was a
little Port called Quinchang, where the Fathers of the
Mission usually landed from Macao, on their Progress to
teach the Christian Religion to the Chineses, and where no
European Ships ever put in; and if I thought to put in there,
I might consider what sarther Course to take when I was
on Shore: He confess'd, he said, it was not a Place for
Merchants, except that at some certain Times they had
a kind of a Fair there when the Merchants from Japan
came over thither to buy the Chinese Merchandizes.
W e all agreed to go back to this Place; the Name of
the Port, as he called it, I may perhaps spell wrong; for I
do not particularly remember it, having lost this together
with the Names of many other Places set down in a lit-
tle Pocket Book, which was spoil'd by the Water, on an
Accident which I shall relate in its Order; but this I re-
member, that the Chinese, or Japanese Merchants we cor-
respond with, called it by a differing Name from that which
our Portuguex* Pilot gave it, and pronounced it as above,
GjjUindumg.
A s we were unanimous in our Resolutions to go to this
Place, we weigh'd the next Day, having not only gone twice
on Shore, where we woe to get fresh Water; on both
which Occasions the People of the Country were very civil
to us, and brought us abundance of Things to Jell to us;
I mean of Provisions, Plants, Roots, Tea, Rice, and some
Fowls; but nothing without Money.
We came to the other Port (the Wind being contrary)
not till five Days, but it was very much to our Satissaction;
and I was joyful, and I may say thankful, when I set my
Foot safe on Shore; resolving, and my Partner too, that if
it was possible to dispose of ourselves and Effects any
other way, though not every way to our Satissaction, we
would never set one Foot on board that unhappy Vessel
more; and indeed I must acknowledge, that of all the
Circumstances of Life, that ever I had any Experience of,
nothing makes Mankind so completely miserable as that,
of being in constant Fear. Well does the Scripture say,
The Fear of Man brings a Snare ; it is a Life of Death, and
the Mind-is so intirely supprefs'd by it, that it is capable
of no Relief; the animal Spirits sink, and all the Vigour
of Nature, which usually supports Men under other Af-
flictions, and is present to them in the greatest Exigencies,
sails them here.
Nor did it sail of its usual Operations upon the Fancy,
by heightening every Danger, representing the English and
Dutch Captains to be Men uncapable or hearing Reason,
or distinguishing between honest Men and Rogues; or be-
tween a Story calculated for our own Turn, made out of
nothing, on purpose ro deceive, and a true genuine Ac-
count of our whole Voyage, Progress, and Design; for we
might many Ways have convinced any reasonable Crea-
ture, that we were not Pirates; the Goods we had on
board, the Course we steer'd, our frankly shewing our-
selves, and entring into such and such Ports; even our
very Manner, the Force we had, the Number of Men,
the few Arms, little Ammunition, short Provisions; all these
would have served to convince any Men that we were no
Pirates: The Opium and other Goods we had on board,
would make it appear the Ship had been at Bengal; the
Dutchmen, who it was said, had the Names of all the Men
that was in the Ship. might easily fee that we was a Mix-
ture of English, Portuguese, and Indians, and but two Dutch-'
men on board: These and many other particular Circum-
stances might have made it evident to the Understanding
of any Commander, whose Hands we might sall into, that
we were no Pirates.
But Fear, that blind useless Passion, work'd another
way, and threw us into the Vapours; it bewildered our
Understandings, and set the Imagination at work, to form
a thousand terrible Things, that perhaps might never hap-
pen; we first supposed, as indeed every body had related
to us, that the Seamen on board the Englissti and Dutch
Ships, but especially. the Dutch. were so enraged at the
Name of a Pirate, and especially at our beating of their
Boats, and escaping, that they would not give themselves
leave to inquire, whether we were Pirates or no; but
would execute us off-hand, as we call it, without giving
us any Room for a Defence; we reflected, that there was
really so much apparent Evidence before them, that t; ey
would scarce inquire after any more; as first, that the Ship
1 was
was certainly the same, and that some of the Seamen
among them knew her, and had been on board her; and,
secondly, That when we had Intelligence at the River
Cambodia, that they were coming down to examine us,
we fought their Boats and fled, so that we made no doubt
tut they were fully satisfy'd of our being Pirates, as we
were satisfy'd of the contrary; and I as often said, I knew
not but I should have been apt to have taken the like Cir-
cumstances for Evidence, if the Tables were turn'd, and
my Case was theirs, and have made no Scruple of cutting
all the Crew to Pieces, without believing, or perhaps con-
sidering, what they might have to offer in their Defence.
But let that be how it will, those were our Apprehen-
sions; and both my Partner and I too scarce slept a Night,
without dreaming of Halters, and Yard-Arms; that is to
say, Gibbets; of fighting, and being taken; of killing and
being kiil'd; and one Night I was in such a Fury in my
Dream, sansying the Dutchmen had boarded us, and I
was knocking one of their Seamen down, that I struck my
double Fist against the Side of the Cabin I lay in with such
a Force as wounded my Hand most grievously, broke my
Knuckles, and cut and bruised the Flesh, so that it not only
wak'd me out of my S.'eep, but I was once afraid I should
have lost two of my Fingers.
Another Apprehension I had, was of the cruel Usage
we should meet with from them, if we fell into their Hands;
then the Story of Amboyna came into my Head, and how
the Dutch might perhaps torture us, as they did our Coun-
trymen there; and make some of our Men by Extremity
of Torture, confess those Crimes they never were guilty
of; own themselves, and all of us to be Pirates, and so
they would put us to Death, with a formal Appearance of
Justice; and that they might be tempted to do this, for
the Gain of our Ship and Cargo, which was worth four
or five thousand Pounds, put all together.
These Things tormented me and my Partner too,
Night and Day, nor did we consider that the Captains of
Ships have no Authority to act thus; and if we had sur-
render'd Prisoners to them, they could not answer the
destroying us, or torturing us, but would be accountable
forit when they came into their own Country: This I
say, gave me no Satisfaction; for if they will act thus with
us, what Advantage would it be to us that they would be
call'd to an Account for it; or if we were first to be mur-
dered.
dered, what Satissaction would it be to us, to have them
punished when they came home?
I cannot refrain taking Notice here, what Reflections I
now had upon the past Variety of my particular Circum-
stances; how hard I thought it was, that I who, had spent
forty Years in a Life of continued Difficulties, and was at
last come as it were at the Port or Haven, which all Men
drive at, {vtz.) to have Rest and Plenty, should be a Vo-
luntier in new Sorrows, by my own unhappy Choice;
and that I, who had escaped so many Dangers in my Youth,
should now come to be hang'd in my old Age, and in so
remote a Place, for a Crime I was not in the least inclin'd
to, much less guilty of; and in a Place and Circumstance,
where Innocence was not like to be any Protection at all
to me.
After these Thoughts, something of Religion would
come in; and I would be considering, that this seem'd to
me to be a Disposition of immediate Providence ; and I
ought to look upon it, and submit to it as such; that al-
tho' I was innocent as to Men, I was sar from being inno-
cent as to my Maker; and I ought to look in and examine
what other Crimes in my Life were most obvious to me,
and tor which Providence might justly inflict this Punish-
ment, as a Retribution, and that I ought to submit to this,
just as I would to a Shipwreck, if it had pleased God to
have brought such a Disaster upon me.
In its Turn, natural Courage would sometimes take its
Place; and then I would be talking myself up to vigorous
Resolutions, that I would not be taken, to be barbarously
used by a Parcel of merciless Wretches in cold Blood; that
it were much better to have sallen into the Hands of the
Savages, who were Men-Eaters, and who, I was sure, Would
feast upon me, when they had taken me, than by those,
who would perhaps glut their Rage upon me, by inhuman
Tortures and Barbarities ; that in the Case of the Savages,
I always rcsolv'd to die fighting, to the last Gasp, and why
should I not do so now, seeing it was much more dreadful,
to me at least, to think of salling into these Mens Hands,
than ever it was to think of being eaten by Men? For the
Savages, give them their Due, would not eat a Man till he
was dead, and kill'd them first, as we do a Bullock; but
that these Men had many Arts beyond the Cruelty of
Death. Whenever these Thoughts prevail'd, I was sure to
put myself in a kind of Fever with the Agitations of a
I * supposed
supposed Fight; my Blood would boil, and my Eyes sparkle,
as if I was engag'd; and I always resolv'd that I would take
so Quarter at their. Hands, but even at last, if I could resist
ho longer, I would blow. up the Ship and all that was in
ter, and leave them but little Booty to boast of.
By how much the greater Weight the Anxieties and
Perplexities of these Things were to our Thoughts while we
wete at Sea, by so much the greater was our Satissaction,
when we saw ourselves on Shore; and my Partner told
me he dream'd, that he had a very heavy Load upon his
Back, which he was to carry up a Hill, and found that he
w.is not able to stand long under it; but the Portugueze
Pilol came and took it off his Back, and the Hill disap-
pear'd, the Ground before him shewing all smooth and
plain; and truly it-was so, we were all like Men who had
a. Load taken off their Backs.
F an my Part, I had a Weight taken off from my Heart,
that I was not able any longer to bear; and, as I said above,
We resolv'd to go no more to Sea in that Ship. When we
came on Shore, the old Pilot, who was now our Friend,
got us/a Lodging and a Warehouse for our Goods, which,
by .the way, was much the seme; it was a little House or
Hut, with a large House joining to it, all built with Canes,
and palisadoed round with large Canes to keep out pilfer-
ing Thieves, of which it seems there were not a few in
the Country; however, .the Magistrates allow'd us also a
little Guard, and we had a Soldier with a kind of Halbert
or Halfpike, who stood Centinel at our Door ; to whom
we allow'd a Pint of Rice, and a little Piece of Money,
about the Value of three Pence, per Day, so that our Goods
were kept very safe.
Tp.F. Fair or Mart usually kept in this Place, had been
over some Time; however, we found that there were
three or four Junks in the River, and two Japanners, I
mean, Ships from Japan, with Goods which they had
bought in QhUa, and were not gone away, having Japa-
nese Merchants on Shore.
Tuæ .'first thing our old Portuguese Pilot did for us, was
to bring us acquainted with three Missionary Romi(l> Priests,
who were in the Town, and who had been there some
time, converting the 'People to Christianity; but we thought
they made but poor Work of it, and made them but
sorry Christians when they had done; however, that was
*or.e of our Business: Orxjof these was a Frenchman, who
they
E J
they call'd Father Simon; he was a jolly well-condition'c!
Man, very free in his Conversation, not seeming so seri-
ous and grave as the other two did; one of whom was a
Portuguese, and the other a Genoese; but Father Simon was
courteous, easy in his Manner, and very agreeable Com-
pany; the other two were more reserv'd, seem'cs rigid
and austere, and apply'd seriously to the Work they camtf
about, (vix..) to talk with, and insinuate themselves among
the Inhabitants, where-ever they hadOpportunity; weofterr
eat and drank with those Men, and though I must confess,'
the Conversion, at they call it, of the Chineses to Christi-
anity, is so sar from the true Conversion requir'd, to bring'
Heathen People to the Faith of Christ, that it seems to
amount to little more than letting them know the Name
of Christ, say some Prayers to the Virgin Mary, and her
Son, in a Tongue which they understand not, and to cross
themselves and the like; yet it must be confess'd that
these Religious, who we call Missionaries, have a firm
Belief that these People shall be sav'd, and that they are the
Instruments of it; and on this Account, they undergo not
only the Fatigue of the Voyage, and Hazards of living in
such Places, but oftentimes Death itself, with the most vio-
lent Tortures, for the Sake of this Work; and it would be
a great Want of Charity in us, whatever Opinion we have
of the Work itself, and the Manner of their doing it, if we
should not have a good Opinion of their Zeal, who under-
take it with so many Hazards, and who have no Prospect
of the least Temporal Advantage to themselves.
But to return to my Story; This French Priest, Father
Simon, was appointed, it seems, by Order of the Chief of
the Mission to go up to f eking, the Royal Seat of the Chi-
nese Emperor, and waited only for another Priest, who was
brder'd to come to him from Macao, to go along with him;
and we scarce ever met together, but he was inviting me
to go that Journey with him, telling me, how he would
shew me all the glorious Things of that mighty Empire;
and among the rest, the greatest City in the World; a City,
said he, that your London and our Paris put together can-r
not be equal to. This was the City ot Peking, which I
confess is very great, and infinitely full of People; but as
I look'd on those Things with different Eyes from other
Men, so I shall give my Opinion of them in few W ords,
when I come, in the Course of my Travels, to speak
more particularly of them.
I 3 But
But first, I come to my Friar, or Missionary; dining
with him one Day, and being very merry together, I shew'd
some little Inclination to go with him, and he press'd me
and my Partner very hard, and with a great many Persua-
sions, to consent: Why, Father Simon, says my Partner,
why should you desire our Company so much? You know
we are Hereticks, and you do not love us, nor cannot keep
us Company with any Pleasure. O! says he, you may per-
haps be good Catholicks in time; my Business here is to
convert Heathens, and who knows but I may convert
you too? Very well Father, said I, so you will preach to
us all the Way. I won't be troublesome to you, says he,
pur Religion does not divest us ot good Manners; besides,
says he, we are here like Countrymen, and so we are,
compared to the Place we are in; and if you are Hugo-
nots, and I a Catholick, we may be all Christians at last i
at least, said he, we are all Gentlemen, and we may con-
verse so, without being uneasy to one another. I lik'd
that Part of his Discourse very well, and it began to put
me in Mind of my Priest, that I had left in the Brafils;
but this Father Simon did not come up to his Character
by a great deal; for tho' Father Simon had no Appearance
of a Criminal Levity in him neither, yet he had not that
Fund of Christian Zeal, strict Piety, and sincere Affection
to Religion, that my other goodEcclesiastick had, of whom
I have said so much.
But to leave him a little, tho' he never left us, nor
soliciting us to go with him; but we had something else
before us at that time; for we had all this while our Ship
and our Merchandize to dispose of, and we began to be
very doubtful what we should do, for we were now in a
Place of very little Business; and once I was about to ven-
ture to sail for the River of Kilam, and the City of Nanquin .v
But Providence scem'd now more visibly, as 1 thought, than
ever, to concern itself in our Affairs; and I was encou-
raged from this very Time, to think, I should one way or
other, get out of this tangled Circumstance, and be brought
home to my own Country again; tho' I had not the least
View of the Manner; and when I began sometimes to
think of it, could not imagine by what Method it was to
be done: Providence, I fay, began here to clear up our way
a little; and the first Thing that offer'd was, that our old
Vortngueze Pilot brought a Japan Merchant to us, who
began to inquire what Goods we had, and in the first
Place,
Place, he bought all our Opium, and gave us a very good
Price for it, paying us in Gold by Weight, some in small
Pieces, of their own Coin, and some in small Wedges, of
about ten or eleven Ounces each. While we were dealing
with him for our Opium, it came into my Head, that
he might perhaps deal with us for the Ship too, and I
ordered the Interpreter to propose it to him. He shrunk
up his Shoulders at it, when it was first proposed to him;
but in a few Days after, he came to me with one of the
Missionary Priests for his Interpreter, and told me, he had
a Proposal to make to me, and that was this ; he had
bought a great Quantity of Goods of us, when he had
no Thoughts (or Proposals made to him ) of buying the
Ship, and that therefore, he had not Money enough to
pay for the Ship; but if I would let the same Men who
were in the Ship navigate her, he would hire the Ship to
go to Japan, and would send them from thence to the
Philippine Islands with another Loading, which he would
pay the Freight of, before they went from Japan ; and
that at their Return he would buy the Ship. I began to
listen to his Proposal, and so eager did my Head still run
upon Rambling, that I could not but begin to entertain a
Notion myself of going with him, and so to fail from the
Philippine Islands, away to the South Seas; and accordingly
-I asked the Japoncse Merchant if he would not hire us to
the Philippine Islands, and discharge us there; he said, no,
he could not do that, for then he could not have the Re-
turn of his Cargo; but he would discharge us in Japan,
he said, at the Ship's Return. Well, still I was tor taking
him at that Proposal, and going myself; but my Partner,
wiser than myself, persuaded me from it, representing the
Dangers, as well of the Seas, as of the Japoneses, who are
a salie, cruel, and treacherous People; and then of the Spa-
niards at the Philippines, more salie, more cruel, more trea-
cherous than they.
But to bring this long Turn of our Affairs to a Con-
clusion; the first thing we had to do, was to consult with
the Captain of the Ship, and with his Men, and know if
they were willing to go to Japan; and while I was do-
ing this, the young Man, who, as I said, my Nephew had
left with me as my Companion for my Travels, came to
me, and told me, that he thought that Voyage promised
very sair, and that there was a great Prospect of Advan-
tage, and he would be very glad if I undertook it; but
1 4 that
that if I would not, and would give him Leave, he would
go as a Merchant, or how I pleas'd to order him; that if
ever he came to England, and I was there, and alive, he
would render me a saithful Account of his Success, and it
should be as much mine as I pleas'd.
I was really loth to part with hirm but considering the
Prospect of Advantage which was really considerable, and
that he was a young Fellow, as likely to do well in it as
any I knew, 1 inclin'd to let him go; but first I told him
I would consult my Partner, and give him an Answer the
next Day. My Partner and I discours'd about it, and my
Partner made a most generous Offer; he told me, you know
it has been an unlucky Ship, and we both resolve not to
go to Sea in it again; if your Steward, so he call'dmyMan,
will venture the Voyage, I'll leave my Share of the Vessel
to him, and let him make the best of it; and if we live
to meet in England, and he meets with Success abroad,
he shall account for one half of the Profits of the Ship's
Freight to us, the other shall be his own.
I p my Partner, who was no way concern'd with my
young Man, made him such an Offer, I could do no less than
offer him the same; and all the Ship's Company being
willing to go with him, we made over half the Ship to
him in Property, and took a Writing from him, obliging
him to account for the other, and away he went to Ja-
fan. The Japan Merchant prov'd a very punctual honest
Man to him, protected him at Japan, and got him a Li-
cence to come on Shore, which the Europeans in general
have not lately obtained; paid him his Freight very punc-
tually, sent him to the Philippines, loaded with Japan and
China Wares, and a Supra-Cargo of their own, who traf-
ficking with the Spaniards, brought back European Goods
again, and a great Quantity of Cioves and other Spice;
and there he was not only paid his Freight very well, and
at a very good Price, but being not willing to fell the Ship,
then the Merchant furnished him with Goods on his own
Account; that for some Money, and some Spices of his
own, which he brought with him, he went back to the
Manillas, to the Spaniards, where he fold his Cargo very
well: Here hiving gotten a good Acquaintance at Manilla,
he got his Ship made a free Ship; and the Governor of
Manilla hired him to go to Accapulco in America, on the
Coast of Mexico, and gave him a Licence to land there, and
travel
travel to Mexico, and to pass in any Spanish Ship to Europe,
with all his Men.
He made the Voyage'to" Acchpulco very happily, and
there he sold his Ship; and having there also obtained Al-
lowance to travel by Land to Porto hello, he found Means,
some how or other, to go to Jamaica with all his Trea-
sure; and about eight Years after came to England exceed-
ing rich: ot which I shall take Notice in its Place; in
the mean Time, I return to our particular Affairs.
Being now to part with the Ship and Ship's Com-
pany; it came before us of Course, to consider what Re-
compence we should give to the two Men, that gave us
such timely Notice of the Design against us in the River
of Cambodia: The Truth was, they had done us a con-
siderable Service, and deserved well at our Hands, though,.
by the way, they were a Couple of Rogues too; for as
they believ'd the Story of our being Pirates, and that we had
really run away with the Ship, they came down to us,
not only to betray the Design: that was form'd against us,
but to go to Sea with us as Pirates; and one of them cori-
fess'd afterwards, that nothing else but the Hopes of go-
ing a Roguing, brought him to do it: However, the Ser-
vice they did us was not the less; and therefore, as 1 had
promised to be grateful to them, I first order'd the Mo-
ney to be paid to them, which they said was due to 'em
on board their respective Ships; that is to say, the English-
man nineteen Months Pay, and to the Dutchman. sevens
and over and above that, I gave each of them a small
Sum of Money in Gold, and which contented them very
well; then I made the Englishman Gunner in the Ship; the
Gunner being now made Second Mate and Purser; the
Dutchman I made Boatswain; so they were both very well
pleas'd, and prov'd very serviceable, being both able Sea-
men, and very stout Fellows.
We were now on Shore in China: If I thought my-
self banish'd, and remote from my own Country at Ben-
gal, where I had many Ways to get home for my Mo-
ney; what could 1 think of myself now, when I was got-
ten about a thousand Leagues sarther off from home, and
perfectly destitute of all manner of Prospect of Return.. .'
All we had for it was this, that in about four Months
Time, there was to be another Fair at that Place where we
were, and then we might be able to purchase all Sorts. of
I'S the
the Manufactures of the Country, and withal might pos-
sibly find some Chinese Junks or Vessels from Nanquin,
that would be to be fold, and would carry us and our
Goods, whither we pleas'd. This I lik'd very well, and
resolv'd to wait; besides, as our particular Persons were
not obnoxious, so if any 'English or Dutch Ships came thi-
ther, perhaps we might have an Opportunity to load our
Goods, and get Passage to some other Place in India nearer
tome.
Upon these Hopes we resolv'd to continue here; but,
to divert ourselves, we took two or three Journeys into
the Country; first we went ten Days Journey to fee the
City of Nanquin, a City well worth seeing indeed; they
say it has a Million of People in it; which, however, I do
not believe; it is regularly built, the Streets all exactly
strait, and cross one another, in direct Lines, which gives
the Figure of it great Advantage.
But when I came to compare the miserable People of
these Countries with ours; their Fabricks, their Manner of
Living, their Government, their Religion, their Wealth,
and their Glory, (as some call it) I must confess, I do
not so much as think it worth naming, or worth my
while to write of, or any that shall come after me to
lead.
I t is very observable, that we wonder at the Grandeur,
the Riches, the Pomp, the Ceremonies, the Government,
the Manusactures, the Commerce, and the Conduct of these
People; not that it is to be wondered at, or indeed in
the least to be regarded; but because, having first a No-
tion of the Barbarity of those Countries, the Rudeness and
the Ignorance that prevail there, we do not expect to
find any such Things so sar off.
Otherwise, what are their BuiUings to the Palaces
and Royal Buildings of Europe! What their Trade, to the
universal Commerce of England, Holland, France, and Spain I
What their Cities.to ours, for Wealth, Strength, Gaiety of
Apparel, rich Furniture, and an infinite Variety? What
arc their Ports, supply'd with-a few Junks and Barks, to
our Navigation, our Merchants Fleets, our large and pow-
erful Navies? Our City of London has more Trade than all
their mighty Empire: One English, or Dutch, or French
Man of War of 80 Guns, would fight with, and destroy all
the Shipping of China: But the Greatness of their Wealth,
their Trade, the Power of their Government, and Strength
of their Armies, is surprising to us, because, as I have said,
considering them as a barbarous Nation of Pagans, little
better than Savages, we did not expect such Things among
them i and this indeed is the Advantage with which all
their Greatness and Power is represented to us; otherwise
it is in itself nothing at all; for as I have said of their
Ships, so may be said of their Armies and Troops; all the
Forces of their Empire, though they were to bring two
Millions of Men into the Field together, would be able to do
nothing but ruin the Country, and starve themselves: If
they were to besiege a strong Town in Flanders, or to fight
a disciplined Army, one Line of German Cuirassiers, or a
French Cavalry, would overthrow all the Horse of China;
a Million of their Foot could not stand before one embat-
tled Body of our Insantry, posted so as not to be sur-
Tounded, though they were not to be one to twenty in
Number; nay I do not boast, if I say, that 30,000 Ger-
man orFnglish Foot, and 10,000 French Horse, would fair-
ly beat all the Forces of China: And so of our fortified
Towns, and of the Art of our Engineers in assaulting and
defending Towns; there's not a fortified Town in China,
could hold out one Month against the Batteries and At,
tacks of an European Army; and at the same Time, all
the Armies of China could never take such a Town as
Dunkirk, provided it was not starv'd; no, not in ten Years
Siege. They have Fire-arms, 'tis true; but they are auk-
ward, clumsy, and uncertain in going off; they have Pow-
der, but it is of no Strength; they have neither Discipline
in the Field, Exercise to their Arms, Skill to attack, or
Temper to retreat; and therefore, I must confess, it seem'd
strange to me, when I came home, and heard our People
fey such fine Things of the Power, Riches, Glory, Magni-
ficence and Trade of the Chinese, because I saw and knew
that they were a contemptible Herd, or Croud of ignorant
sordid Slaves, subjected to a Government qualified only to
rule such a People; and in a Word, for lam now launch'd
quite beside my Design, I say, in a Word, were not its Di-
stance inconceivably great from Muscovy, and were not the
Muscovite Empire almost as rude, impotent and ill govern'd.
a Croud of Slaves as they, the Czar of Muscovy might with
much Ease drive them all out of their Country, and conquer
them in one Campaign; and had the Czar, who I siuce
hear is a growing Prince, and begins to appear formidable
in the World, sallen this way, instead of attacking the
I 6 warlike
warlike Swedes, in which Attempt none of the Powers of
Europe would have envy'd or interrupted him; he might
by this Time have been Emperor of China, instead of be-
ing beaten by the King of Sweden at Narva, when the
latter was not one to iix in Number. As their Strength
and their Grandeur, so their Navigation, Commerce and
Husbandry, is imperfect and impotent, compar'd to the
same Things in Europe j also in their Knowledge, their
Learning, their Skill in the Sciences; they have Globes and
Spheres, and a Smatch of the Knowledge of the Mathema-
ticks; but when you come to inquire into their Know-
ledge, how short-lighted are the wisest of their Students!
they know nothing of the Motion of the heavenly Bodies-;
and so grosly abiurdly ignorant, that when the Sun is
eclipsed, they think it is a great Dragon has assaulted and run
away with it, and they sall a clattering with all the Drums
and Kettles in the Country, to fright the Monster away,
just as we do to hive a Swarm of Bees.
A s this is the only Excursion of this Kind which I have
made in all the 'Account I have given of my Travels, so I
shall make no more Descriptions of Countries and People,
'tis none of my Business, or any Part of my Design; but
giving an Account os my own Adventures, through a
Life of inimitable Wandrings, and a long Variety of Chan-
ges, which perhaps few have heard the like of, I shall say
nothing of the mighty Places, desart Countries and
numerous People, I have yet to pass through, more than
relates to my own Story, and which my Concern among
them will make necessary. I was now, as near as I can
compute, in the Heart of China, about the Latitude of
thirty Degrees North of the Line, for we were return'd
from Nanquin; I had indeed a Mind to fee the City of
Veking, which I had heard so much of, and Father Simon
importuned me daily to do it; at length his Time of go-
ing away being set, and the other Missionary, who was
to go with him, being arrived from Macao, it was necessary
that we should resolve, either to go, or not to go; so I re-
ferr'd him to my Partner, and lett it wholly to his Choice,
who at length resolv'd it in the Affirmative, and we pre-
paid for our Journey. We set out with very good Ad-
vantage, as to finding the Way, for we got leave to travel
in the Retinue of one of their Mandarins, a kind of Vice-
roy, or principal Magistrate in the Province where they
reside, and who take great State upon them, travelling
with great Attendance, and with great Homage from the
People, who are sometimes greatly impoveristYd by them,
because all the Countries they pass thro' are oblig'd to fur-
nish Provisions for them and all their Attendants: That
which I particularly observed, as to our travelling with his
Baggage, was this, that thp' we received sufficient Provisi-
ons, both for our selves and our Horses, from the Coun-
try, as belonging to the Mandarin's, yet we were oblig'd to
pay for every thing we had, after the Market-Price of the
Country, and the Mandarin Steward, or Commissary of
the Provisions, collected it duly from us, so that our tra-
velling in the Retinue of the Mandarin, tho' it was a very
great Kindness to us, was not such a mighty Favour in
him, but was indeed a great Advantage to him,considering
there were about thirty other People travelled in the fame
Manner besides us, under the Protection of his Retinue,
or, as we may call it, under his Convoy r This, I fay, was
a great Advantage to him, for the Country furnished all
the Provisions for nothing, and he took all our Money for
them.
W e were five and twenty Days travelling to Peking,
through a Country infinitely populous, but miserably cul-
tivated, the Husbandry, Oeconomy, and the Way of living,
all very miserable, tho' they boast so much of the Industry
of the People; I fay, miserable; and so it is, it we, who
understand how to live, were to endure it, or to compare
it with our own; but not so to these poor Wretches who
know no other. The Pride of these People is infinitely
great, and exceeded by nothing but their Poverty, which
adds to that which I call their Misery. I must needs think
the naked Savages of America live much more happy, be-
cause, as they have nothing, so they desire nothing; where-
as these are proud and insolent, and in the main are mere
Beggars and Drudges; their Ostentation is inexpressible, and
is chiefly shew'd in their Cioaths and Buildings, and in the
keeping Multitudes of Servants or Slaves, and which is to
the last Degree ridiculous, their Contempt of all the World
but themselves.
I must confess, I travell'd more pleafantly afterwards
in the Defarts and vast Wildernesses of Grand Tartary, than
here; and yet the Roads here are well pav'd, and well kept,
and very convenient for Travellers; but nothing was more
aukward to me, than to see such a haughty, imperious,
insolent People, in the midst of the grossest Simplicity and
Ignorance, for all their sam'd Ingenuity is no more: My
Friend Father Sim n and I uled to be very merry upon these
Occasions, to fee the beggarly Pride of those People; for
Example, coming by the House of a Country Gentleman,
as Father Simon call'd him, about ten Leagues off of the
City of Nanquin, we had, first: of all, the Honour to ride
with the Matter of the House, about two Miles; the State
he rode in, was a perfect Don Jguixotism, being a Mix-
ture of Pomp and Poverty.
The Habit of this greasy Don was very proper for a
Scaramouch, or Merry-Andrew ; being a dirty Callicoe,
with all the tawdry Trappings of a Fool's Coat, such as
Hanging-Sleeves, Tassels, and Cuts and Slashes almost on
every Side; it cover'd a rich Taffaty Vest, as greasy as a
Butcher, and which testity'd, that his Honour must needs
be a most exquisite Sloven.
H1 s Horse was a poor, lean, starv'd, hobbling Crea-
ture, such as in England might fell for about 30 or 40
Shillings, and he had two Slaves follow'd him on Foot, to
drive the poor Creature along; he had a Whip in his Hand,
and he belabour'd the Beast as sast about the Head as his
Slaves did about the Tail, and thus he rode by us with
about ten or twelve Servants, and we were told he was
going from the City to his Country-Seat, about half a League
before us: We travell'd on gently, but this Figure of a
Gentleman rode away before us, and as we stopp'd at a
Village about an Hour to refresh us, when we came by
the Country-Seat of this great Man, we saw him in a lit-
tle Place, before his Door, eating his Repast; it was a
Kind of a Garden, but he was easy to be seen, and we
were given to understand, that the more we look'd on
him, the better he would be pleased.
He sat under a Tree, something like the Palmetto-Tree,
which effectually shaded him over the Head, and on the
South-side; but under the Tree also was plac'd a large Um-
brella, which made that Part look well enough; he sat
loiling back in a great Elbow-Chair, being a heavy corpu-
lent Man, and his Meat being brought him by two Women
Slaves; he had two more, whose Office, I think, sew
Gentlemen in Europe would accept of their Service in(4>r%.)
One fed the Squire with a Spoon, and the other held the
Dish with one Hand, and scrap'd off what he let sall upon
his Worship's Beard and Taffaty Vest, with the other;
while the great sat Brute thought it below him to employ
his own Hands in any of those familiar Offices, which
Kings and Monarchs would rather do, than be troubled
with the clumsy Fingers of their Servants.
I took this Time to think what Pain Mens Pride puts
them to; and how troublesome a haughty Temper, thus
ill manag'd, must be to a Man of common Sense ; and
leaving the poor Wretch to please himself with our look-
ing at him, as if we admir'd his Pomp, whereas we really
pity'd and contemn'd him, we pursu'd our Journey; only
Father Simon had the Curiosity to stay to inform himself
what Dainties the Country Justice had to feed on, in all
his State; which he faid he had the Honour to taste of,
and which was, I think, a Dose that an English Hound
would scarce have eaten, if it had been offer'd him, (viz.,)
a Mess of boil'd Rice, with a great Piece of Garlick in it,
and a little Bag fill'd with Green Pepper, and another Plant
which they have there, something like our Ginger, but
smelling like Musk, and tasting like Mustard; all this was
put together, and a small Lump or Piece of lean Mutton
boil'd in it; and this was his Worship's Repast, four or
five Servants more attending at a Distance. If he fed them
meaner than he was fed himself, the Spice excepted, they
must fare very coursefy indeed.
A s for our Mandarin, with whom we travell'd, he was
respected like a King; surrounded always with his Gen-
tlemen, and attended in all his Appearances with such
Pomp, that I faw little of him but at a Distance; but this
I observ'd, that there was not a' Horse in his Retinue,
but that our Carriers Pack-Horsis in England seem to me
to look much better; but they were so cover'd with Equi-
page, Mantles, Trappings, and such-like Trumpery, that
you cannot fee whether they are fat or lean ; in a Word,
we could see scarce any thing but their Feet and their
Heads.
I was now light-hearted, and all my Trouble and Per-
p'exity that I have given an Account ot being over, I had
no anxious Thoughts about me, which made this Journey
much the pleafanter to me; nor had I any ill Accident
attended me, only in the passing or fording a small Ri-
ver, my Horse fell, and made me free of the Country, as
they call it, that is to fay, threw me in; the Place was not
deep, but it wetttrd me all over ; I mention it because it
spou'd my Pocket-Book, wherein I had set down the
Names of several People and Places which I had Occasion
to
to remember, and which not taking due Care of, tBfr
Leaves rotted, and the Words were never after to be
read, to my great Loss, as to the Names of some ^Places
which I touch'd at in this Yoyage.
A t length, we arrived at Peking ; I had nobody with
me but the Youth, who my Nephew, the Captain, had
given me to attend me as a Servant, and who proved very
trusty and diligent> and my Partner had nobody with him
but one Servant, who was a Kinsman : As for the Portu-
guese Pilot, he being desirous to fee the Court, we gave him
his Passage, that is to say, bore his Charges for his Com-
pany; and to use him as an Interpreter, for he understood
the Language of the Country, and spoke good French, and
a little English; and indeed, this old Man was a most useful
Implement to us every where; for we had not been above
a Week at Peking, when he came laughing, Ah, Seignior
Inglise, says he, I have something to tell you, will make
your Heart glad. My Heart glad, said I, What can that
be i I don't know any thing in this Country can either give
me Joy or Grief, to any great Degree. Xes, yes, said the old
Man, in broken English, make you glad, me sorrow ; sorry
he would have said. This made me more inquisitive. Why,
said I, will it make you sorry ? Because, said he, you have
brought me here 1f Daysffourney, andwill leave me to go back
alone ; and which way shall I get to my Port afterwards
without a Ship, without a Horse, without Pecune? So he
called Money, being his broken Latin, of which he had
abundance to make us merry with.
I n short, he told us there was a great Caravan of Mus-
covite and Polish Merchants in the City, and they were
preparing to set out on their Journey by Land to Muscovy,
within four or five Weeks, and he was sure we would take
the Opportunity to go with them, and leave him behind to
go back all alone. 1 confess, I was furpriz'd with his News;
a secret Joy spread itself over my whole Soul, which I
cannot describe, and never felt before or since, and 1 had
no Power for a good while to speak a Word to the old
Man; but at last I turned to him; How do you know this,
said I, are you sure it is true? Yes, says he, I met this
Morning, in the Street, an old Acquaintance of mine, an
Armenian, or one you call a Grecian, who is among them;
he came last from Asracan, and was designing to go to
Tonquin, where I formerly knew him, but has alter'd his
Mind, and is now resolved to go back w,ith the Caravan to
Moscow, and so down the River of Volga to Astraesn.
Well, Seignior, faid I, do not be uneasy about being left
to go back alone; if this be a Method for roy Return to
England, it shall be your Fault, if you go back to Macao
at all: We then went to consulting together what was to
be done, and ask'd my Partner what he thought ot the
Pilot's News, and whether it would suit with his Affairs?
He told me he would do just as I would, for he had settled
all his Affairs so well at Bengal, and left his Effects in
such good Hands, that as we had made a good Voyage here,
if he could vest it in China Silks, wrought and raw, such
as might be worth the Carriage, he would be content to
go to England, and then make his Voyage back to Bengal
by the Company's Ships.
Having relblv'd upon this, we agreed, that if our
Portugal Pilot would go with us, we would bear his Char-
ges to Moscow, or to England, if he pleas'd; nor indeed were
we to be esteemed over-generous in that Part neither, if
we had not rewarded him farther, for the Service he had
done us was really worth all that, and more; for he had
not only been a Pilot to us at Sea, but he had been also like
a Broker for us on Shore; and his procuring for us the
Japan Merchant, was some Hundreds of Pounds in out
Pockets : So we consulted together about it, and being
willing to gratify him, which was indeed but doing him ju-
stice, and very willing also to have him with us besides, for
he was a most necesfary Man on all Occasions, we agreed
to give him a Quantity of coin'd Gold, which, as I com-
pute it, came to about 17 j- Pounds Sterling between us,
and to bear all his Charges, both for himself and Horse,
except only a Horse to carry his Goods.
Having settled this among our selves, we call'd him
to let him know what we had resolv'd; I told him, he had
complain'd of our being like to let him go back alone, and
I was now to tell him we were resolv'd he should not go
back at all: That as we had resolved to go to Europe with
the Caravan, we resolv'd also he should go with us, and
that we call'd him to know his Mind. He shook his Head,
and faid, it was a long Journey, and he had no Pecune to
carry him thither, nor to subsist himself when he came
there. We told him, we believed it was so, and therefore
we had resolv'd to do something for him, that should let
him see how sensible we were of the Service he had done
us, and also how agreeable he was to us; and then I told him
what we had resolved to give him here, which he might
Jay out as we would do our own; and that as for his Char-
ges, if he would go with us, we would set him fafe a-shore,
(Life and Casualties excepted) either in Muscovy or Eng-
land, which he would, at our own Charge, except only the
Carriage of his Goods.
He received the Proposal like a Man transported, and
told us he would go with us over the whole World ; and
so, in short, we all prepar'd our selves for the Journey:
However, as it was with us, so it was with the other
Merchants; they had many Things to do ; and instead of
being ready in five Weeks, it was four Months and some
odd Days before all Things were got together.
I t was the Beginning of February, our Stile, when we
set out from Peking; my Partner and the old Pilot had gone
Express back to the Port where we had first put in, to
dispose of some Goods which we had left there ; and I,
with a Chinese Merchant, who I had some Knowledge of
at Nanquin, and who came to Pelting on his own Affairs,
went to Nanquin, where I bought ninety Pieces of fine
Damasks, with about two hundred Pieces ot other very
fine Silks, of several Sorts, some mix'd with Gold, and
had all these brought to Peking against my Partner's Re-
turn ; besides this, we bought a very large Quantity of
|law Silk, and some other Goods, our Cargo amounting
in these Goods only, to about three thoufand five hundred
Pounds Sterling, which, together with Tea, and some fine
Callicoes, and three Camel Loads of Nutmegs and Cloves,
loaded in all eighteen Camels for our Share, besides those
we rode upon; which, with two or three spare Horses,
and two Horses loaded with Provisions, made us in short
z6 Camels and Horses in our Retinue."
The Company was very great, and, as near as I can re-
member, made between 3 and 4.00 Horse and Camels, and
upwards of a hundred and twenty Men. very well armed
and provided for all Events: For as the Eastern Caravans
are subject to be attacked by the Arabs, so are these by
the Tartars; but they are not altogether so dangerous as
the Arabs, nor so barbarous when they prevail.
The Company consisted of People of several Nations,
such as Muscovites chiefly, for there were above Sixty of
them who were Merchants or Inhabitants of Moscow, tho'
of them some were Livonians, and to our particular Satis-
faction, five of them were Scott, who appear'd also to be
Men
Men of great Experience in Business, and Men of very good
Substance.
When we had travelled one Day's Journey, the Guides,
who were five in Number, called all the Gentlemen and
Merchants, that is to fay, all the Passengers, except theStr-
vants, to a great Council, as they call'd it: At this great
Council every one deposited a certain Quantity of Money
to a common Stock, for the necessary Expence of buying
Forage on the Way, where it was not otherwise to be
had, and for fatisfying the Guides, getting Horses, and the
like: And here they constituted the Journey, as they call'd
it, (viz.) They named Captains and Officers to draw us
all up, and give the Command in Cafe of an Attack, and
gave every one their Turn of Command : Nor was this
forming us into Order, any more than what we found
needful upon the Way, as shall be observed in its Place.
The Road all on this Side of the Country is very po-
pulous, and is full of Potters, and Earth-makers, that is to
fay, People that temper'd the Earth for the China-Ware;
and as I was coming along, our Portugal Pilot, who had
always something or other to fay to make us merry,
came sneering to me, and told me he would show me the
greatest Rarity in all the Country, and that I should have
this to fay of China, after all the ill-humour'd Things I
had faid of it, that I had seen one Thing which was not
to be seen in all the World beside. 18was very importu-
nate to know what it was; at last he told me it was a
Gentleman's House built all with China-Ware. Well, faid
I, are not the Materials of their Building the Product of
their own Country; and so it is all China-Ware, is it not?
No, no, fays he, I mean, it is a House all made of China-
^are, such as you call so in England; or as it is call'd in
our Country, Porcelain: Well, faid I, such a thing may
be; how big is it? Can we carry it in a Box upon a Ca-
mel? If we can, we will buy it: Upon a Camel, fays the
old Pilot, holding up both his Hands, why there is a Fa-
mily of thirty People lives in it.
I was then curious indeed to see it, and when I came
to it, it was nothing but this; it was a Timber House,
or a House built, as we call it in England, with Lath and
Plaister, but all the Plaistering was really China-Ware, that
is to fay, it was plaister'd with the Earth that makes China-
Ware.
The
The Outside, which the Sun shone hot upon was gla-
zed, and look'd very well, perfect white, and painted with
blue Figures, as the large China-Ware in England is painted,
and hard, as if it had been burnt : As to the Inside, all the
Walls, instead of Wainscot, were lined up with harden'd
and painted Tiles, like the little square Tiles we call Gally-
Tiles in England, all made ot the finest China, and the Fi-
gures exceeding fine indeed, with extraordinary Variety of
Colours mix'd with Gold, many Tiles making but one Fi-
gure, but join'd so artificially, the Morter being made of
the same Earth, that it was very hard to see where the
Tiles met: The Floors of the Rooms were of the same
Composition, and as hard as the earthen Floors we have
in ule in several Parts ot England, especially Lincelnfliire,
Hottingbam/l.ire, Lticesterstnre, Sec. as hard as Stone, and
smooch, but not burnt and painted, except some smaller
Rooms, like Closets, which were all as it were paved with
the same Tile; the Cielings, and, in a Word, all the Plai-
stering-Work in the whole House were of the same Earth;
and, after all, the Roof was cover'd with Tiles of the same,
but of a deep shining Black.
This was a China Ware-house indeed, truly and lite-
rally to be called so ; and had I not been upon the Jour-
ney, I could have staid some Days to see and examine the
Particulars of it: They told me there were fountains and
Fish-ponds in the Garden, all paved at the Bottom and
Sides with the same, and fine Statues set up in Rows on
the Walks, intirely formed of the Porcelain Earth, and
burnt whole.
A s this is one of the Singularities of China, so they may
be allow'd to excel in it} but I am very sure they excel
in their Accounts of it ; for they told me such incredible
Things of their Performance in Crockery-ware, for such it
is, that I care not to relate, as knowing it could not be
true; they told me in particular of one Workman that
made a Ship with all its Tackle, and Masts, and Sails, in
Earthen-Ware, big enough to carry fifty Men: If he had
told me he launched it, and made a Voyage to Japan in
it, I might have said something to it indeed; but as it was,
I knew the whole Story, which was, in short, asking Par-
don for the Word, that the Fellow ly'd ; so I smiled, and
iaid nothing to it.
This odd Sight kept me two Hours behind the Cara-
van, for which the Leader of it for the Day, fined me
about
about the Value of three Shillings, and told me, if it had
been three Days Journey without the Wall, as it was three
Days within, he must have fined me four times as much,
and made me ask Pardon the next Council Day; so I pro-
mised to be more orderly ; for indeed I found afterwards
the Orders made for keeping altogether, were absolutely
necessary for our common Safety-
In two Days more we passed the great China Will,
made for a Fortification against the Tartars; and a very
.great Work it is, going over Hills and Mountains in an end-
less Track, where the Rocks are impassable, and the Pre-
cipices such as no Enemy could possibly enter, or indeed
climb up, or where if they did.no Wall could hinder them.
They tell us, its Length is near a thousand English Miles,
but that the Country is five hundred in a strait measured
Line, which the Wall bounds, without measuring the Wind-
ings and Turnings it takes; 'tis about four Fathom high,
and as many thick in some Places.
I stood still an Hour or thereabout, without trespas-
sing our Orders, for so long the Caravan was in pajjing the
Gate; I say, I stood still an Hour to look at it on every
Side, near, and sar off, I mean, what was within my View;
and the Guide of our Caravan, who had been extolling it
for the Wonder of the World, was mighty eager to hear my
Opinion of it. I told him it was a most excellent thing to
keep off the Tartars; which he happened not to understand
as I meant it, and ib took it for a Compliment; but the old
Pilot laugh'd: O Seignior Inglese, says he, you speak in Co-
lours. In Colours, said I, what do you mean by that? Why,
you speak what looks white this way, and black that way;
gay one way, and dull another way; you tell him it is a good
Wall to keep out Tartars; you tell me by that, it is good
for nothing but to keep out Tartars; or it will keep out
none but Tartars; I understand you, Seignior Inglese, I
understand you, says he, joaking, but Seignior Chinese un-
derstand you his own Way.
Well, said I, Seignior, do you think it would stand
out an Army of our Country People, with a good Train
-of Artillery; or our Engineers, with two Companies of
Miners? Would they not batter it down in ten Days, that
an Army might enter in Battalia, or blow it up into the Air,
Foundation and all, that there mould be no Sign of it left?
Ay, ay, says he, I know that. The Chinese wanted migh-
tily to know what I said, and I gave him Leave to tell him
a few Days after, for we were then almost out of their
Country, and he was to leave us in a little time afterward;
but when he knew what I had said, he was dumb all the
rest of the Way, and we heard no more of his fine Story
of the Chinese Power and Greatness, while he stay'd.
A f t e r we had pass'd this mighty Nothing, call'd a Wall,
something like the Pitis Wall, so famous in Northumberland.
and built by the Romans, we began to find the Country
thinly inhabited, and the People rather confined to live in
fortified Towns and Cities, as being subject to the Inroads
and Depredations ot the Tartars, who rob in great Armies,
and therefore are not to be resisted by the naked Inhabi-
tants of an open Country.
And here I began to find the Necessity of keeping to-
gether in a Caravan, as we travell'd ; for we saw several
Troops of Tartars roving about; but when I came to see
them distinctly, I wonder'd more that the Chinese Empire
could be conquer'd by such contemptible Fellows; for they
are a meer Hooid or Croud of wild Fellows, keeping no
Order, and understanding no Discipline, or Manner of Fight.
Their Horses are poor, lean, starved Creatures, taught
nothing, and are fit for nothing; and this we found the first
Djy we saw them, which was after we entered the wilder
Part of the Country; our Leader for the Day, gave Leave
for about sixteen of us to go a hunting, as they call it;
and what was this but hunting of Sheep; however, it may
be call'd Hunting too ; for the Creatures are the wildest
and swiftest of Foot that ever I saw of their Kind; only
they will not run a great Way; and you are lure of Sport
when you begin the Chace; for they appear generally by
thirty or forty in a Flock, and like true Sheep, always
keep together when they fly.
I n Pursuit of this odd Sort of Game, it was our Hap
to meet with about forty Tartars; whether they were
hunting Mutton as we were, or whether they look'd for
another Kind ot Prey, I know not ; but as soon as they
saw us, one of them blew a Kind of Horn very loud,
but with a barbarous Sound that I had never heard before,
and, by the-Way, never care to hear again: We all suppos'd
this was to call their Friends about them, and so it was;
for in less than half a Quarter of an Hour, a Troop of for-
ty or fifty more appear'd at about a Mile distance, but
our Work was over first, as it happen'd.
Onb
4
One of the Scots Merchants of Moscow, happen'd to
be amongst us, and as soon as he heard the Horn, he told
us in short, that we had nothing to do, but to charge them
immediately, without Loss of Time; and drawing us up in
a Line, he ask'd if we were resolv'd? We told him we
were ready to follow him; so he rode directly up to them.
They stood gazing at us like a mere Crowd, drawn up
in no Order, nor shewing the Face of any Order at all;
but as soon as they law us advance they let fly their Ar-
rows, which however miss'd us very happily; it seems they
mistook not their Aim, but their Distance ; for their Ar-
rows all fell a little short of us, but with so true an Aim,
that had we been about twenty Yards nearer, we must
have had several Men wounded, if not killed.
Immediately we halted, and tho' it was at a great
Distance, we fir'd, and sent them Leaden Bullets for Wood-
en Arrows, following our Shot full Gallop, resolving to
fall in among them Sword in Hand, tor so our bold Scot that
led us directed. He was indeed but a Merchant, but he be-
hav'd with that Vigour and Bravery on this Occasion, and
yet with such a cool Courage too, that I never saw any
Man in Action fitter for Command. As soon as we came
up to them, we fir'd our Pistols in their Faces, and then
drew; but they fled in the greatest Confusion imaginable;
the only Stand any of them made, was on our Right, where
three of them stood, and by Signs call'd the rest to come
back to them, having a Kind of Scymiter in their Hands,
and their Bows hanging at their Backs. Our brave Com-
mander, without asking any Body to follow him, gallops
up close to them, and with his Fuz.il knocks one ot them
off his Horse, kill'd the second with his Pistol, and the
third ran away, and thus ended our Fight; but we had this
Misfortune attending it, (viz.) that all our Mutton that we
had in Chace, got away: We had not a Man kill*d or hurt;
but as for the Tartars, there were about five of them kill'd;
how many were wounded, we knew not; but this we
knew, that the other Party was so frighted with the Noise
of our Guns, that they made off, and never made any At-
tempt upon us.
W e were all this while in the Chinese Dominion, and
therefore the Tartars were not so bold as afterwards; but
in about five Days we enter'd a vast great wild Desarr,
which held us three Days and Nights March; and we were
obliged to carry our Water with us in great Leather Bot-
tles,
ties, and to encamp all Night, just as I have heard they da
in the Delarts of Arabia.
Iask'd our Guides, whose Dominion thi; was in?
and they told me, this was a Kind of Border, that might
be call'd No Man's Land; being a Part of the Great Kara-
kathay, or Grand Tartary; but that however it was reck-
ened to China; that there was no Care taken here, to pre-
serve it from the Inroads of Thieves, and therefore it was
reckoned the worst Defart in the whole March, tho' we
were to go over some rnuch larger.
In passing this Wilderness, which, I confess, was at the
first View very frightful to me, we faw two or three times
little Parties of the Tartars, but they seem'd to be upon
their own Affairs, and to have no Design upon us; and so,
like the Man who met the Devil, if they had nothing to
fay to us, we had nothing to fay to them; we let them go.
Once, however, a Party ot them came so near, as to
stand and gaze at us; whether it was to consider what
they should do, (viz,.) to attack us, or not attack us, that
we knew not; but when we were pass'd at some Distance
by them, we made a Rear-Guard of forty Men, and stood
ready for them, letting the Caravan pass half a Mile, or
thereabouts, before us; after awhile they marched off, on-
ly we found they assaulted us with five Arrows at their
parting; one of which wounded a Horse, so that it dis-
abled him; and we left him the next Day, poor Creature,
in great need of a good Farrier; we suppose they might
shoot more Arrows which might tall short of us, but we
faw no more Arrows or Tartars at that Time.
We travell'd near a Month after this, the Ways being
not so good as at first, tho' still in the Dominions of the
Emperor of China, but lay for the most part in Villages,
some of which were fortified, because of the Incursions of
the Tartars. When we came to one of these Towns fit
was about two Days and a half's Journey before we were
to come to the City of Naum) I wanted to buy a Camel,
of which there are plenty to be sold all the Way upon
that Road, and of Horses also, such as they are, because so
many Caravans coming that Way.they are very often wanted.
The Person that I spoke to, to get me a Camel, would have
gone and fetch'd it for me, but I, like a Fool, must be offi-
cious, and go myself along with him: The Place was about
two Miles out of the Village, where, it seems, they kept
the Camels and Horses feedmg under a Guard.
* I
i
.J
I walk'd it on Foot with my old Pilot in Company,
and a Chinese, being very desirous, forsooth, of a little Va-
riety: When we came to this Place, it was a low marshy
Ground, wall'd round with a Stone Wall, piled up dry,
without Morter or Earth among it, like a Park, with a
little Guard of Chinese Soldiers at the Door. Having bought
a Camel, and agreed for the Price, I came away, and the
Chinese Man that went with me led the Camel ; when on
a sudden came up five Tartars on Horse-back; two of 'em
sciz'd the Fellow, and took the Camel from him, while
the other three stepp'd up to me, and my old Pilot; seeing
us, as it were, unarm'd, for I had no Weapon about me
but my Sword, which could but ill defend me against three
Horse-men. The first that came up, stopp'd short upon my
drawing my Sword (tor they are errant Cowards ;) but a
second coming upon my left, gave me a Blow on the
Head, which I never felt till afterward, and wonder'd, when
I came to my self, what was the Matter with me, and
where 1 was, for he laid me flat on the Ground; but my
never-failing old Pilot, the Portuguese (To Providence un-
look'd fer directs Deliverances from Dangers, which to
us are unforeseen j had a Pistol in his Pocket, which I knew
nothing of, nor the Tartan neither; if they had, I sup-
pose they would not have attacked us: But Cowards are
always boldest when there is no Danger.
The old Man seeing me down, with a bold Heart stepp'd
up to the Feliow that had struck me, and laying hold of
his Arm with one Hand, and pulling him down by main
Force a little towards him with the other, he shot him
into the Head, and laid him dead on the Spot; he then
immediately stepp'd up to him who had stopp'd us, as I faid,
and before he could come forward again, (for it was ail
done as it were in a Moment) made a Blow at him with
a Scymiter, which he always wore; but missing the Ma:i,
cut his Horse into the Side of his. Head, cut one of his
Ears off by the Root, and a great Slice down the Side of
his Face: The poor Beast, enraged with the Wounds, was no
more to be govern'd by his Rider, tho' the Fellow lat
well enough too; but away he flew, and carry'd him quite
out of the Pilot's Reach, and at some Distance rising upon
his hind Legs, threw down the Tartar, and fell upon him.
I n this Interval the poor Chinese came in, who had loil
the Camel, but he bad no Weapon; however, seeing the
XarMr down, and his Horse fallen upon him, he runs to
K him,
him, and seizing upon an ugly ill-favour'd Weapon he had
by his Side, something like a Pole-ax, but not a Pole-ax
neither, he wrench'd it from him, and madeshiftto knock
his Tartarian Brains out with it: But my old Man had
the third Tartar to deal with still, and seeing he did not
fly as he expected, nor come on to fight him, as he ap-
prehended, but stood stock still, the old Man stood still too,
and falls to work with his Tackle to charge his Pistol a-
gain; but as soon as the Tartar law the Pistol, whether he
supposed it to he the lame or another, I know not; but
away he scower'd, and left my Pilot, my Champion I cal-
led him afterwards, a complete Victory.
?B y this time I was a little awake, for I thought, when I
first began to awake, that I had been in a sweet Sleep;
but, as I said above, I wondered where I was, how I
came upon the Ground, and what was the Matter; in
a Word, a few Moments after, as Sense returned, I felt
Pain, tho' I did not know where; I clapp'd my Hand to
kmy Head, and took it away bloody, then I felt my Head
.ach, and then in another Moment, Memory returned, and
eT^ry thing was present to me again.
I.jump'd up upon my Feet instantly, and got hold "of
my Sword, but no Enemies in view: I found a Tartar lie
dead, and his Horse standing very quietly by him ; and
looking farther, I faw my Champion and Deliverer, who
had been to see what the Chinese had done, coming back
with his Hanger in his Hand ; the old Man seeing me oa
my Feet, came running to me, and embraced me with a
great deal of Joy, being afraid before that I had been kil-
led, and seeing me bloody, would see how I was hurt, but
it was not much, only what we call a broken Head; nei-
ther did I afterwards find any great Inconvenience from
the.Blow, other than the Place which was hurt, and which
wan well again in two or three Days.
W e made no great Gain however by this Victory, for
we lost a Camel and gain'd a Horses but that which was
remarkable, when we came back to the Village, the Man
demanded to be paid for the Camel ; I disputed it, and
it was brought to a Hearing before the Chinese Judge of
the Place; that is to lay, in English, we went before a Ju-
stice of the Peace. Give him his due, he acted with a great
deal of Prudence and Impartiality; and having heard both
Sides, he gravely ask'd the Chinese Man, that went with me
to buy the Camel, whose Servant he was? I am no Ser-

vant,
vant, fays he, but went with the Stranger: At whole Re-
quest, fays the Justice? At the Stranger's Request, fays he.
Why then, fays the Justice, you were the Stranger's Ser-
vant for the Time, and the Camel being deKver'd to his
Servant, it was deliver'd to him, and he must pay for it.
I confess the Thing was so dear, that I had not a
Word to fay; but admiring to see such just Reasoning
upon the Consequence, and so accurate stating the Case, I
pay'd willingly for the Camel, and sent for another; but
you may observe, I sent for it, I did not ga to fetch it
myself any more, I had enough of that.
The City oiNaum is a Frontier of the Chinese Empire;
they call it fortified, and so it is, as Fortifications go there 5
for this I will venture to affirm, that all the Tartan in Ka-
rakathay, which I believe are some Millions, could not
batter down the Walls with their Bows and Arrows; but
to call it strong, if it were attacked with Cannon, would
be to make those who understand it, laugh at you.
W e wanted, as I have faid, above two Days Journey of
this City, when Messengers were sent express to every Part
of the Road, to tell all Travellers and Caravans to halt
till they had a Guard sent to them; for that an unusual
Body ot Tartars, making ten thoufand in all, had appear'd
in the Way, about thirty Miles beyond the City,
This was very bad News to Travellers ; however it
was carefully done of the Governor, and we were very
glad to hear weshould have a Guard; accordingly two Days
after we had 200 Soldiers sent us from a Garison of the
Chinefes, on our left, and three hundred more from the
City of Naum, and with those we advanced boldly ; the
300 Soldiers from Naum, march'd in our Front, the zoo
in our Rear, and our Men on each Side of our Camels
with our Baggage, and the whole Caravan in the Centre;
in this Order, and well prepar'd for Battle, we thought our
selves a Match for the whole 10,000 Mongul Tartars, if
they had appear'd; but the next Day, when they did ap-
pear, it was quite another Thing.
It was early in the Morning, when marching from a
little well situated Town, called Changu, we had a River
to pass, where we were obliged to ferry; and had the Tar-
tars had an Intelligence, then had been the Time to have
attacked us, when the Caravan being over, the Rear-Guard
was behind : but they did not appear there.
»
K 1 About
About three Hours after, when we were enter' d upon
a Dessre of about fifteen or sixteen Miles over, behold, by
a Cloud of Dust they rais'd, we faw an Enemy was ac
hand; and they were at hand indeed, for they came on
upon the Spur.
The Chinese, our Guard oa the Front, who had talk'd
so big the Day before, began to stagger, and the Soldiers
frequently Iook'd behind them, which is a certain Sign in
a Soldier that he is just ready to run away; my old Pilot
was of my Mind, and being near me, he call'd out, Seig-
nior Inglefc, fays he, those Fellows must be encouraged, or
they will ruin us all; for if the Tartars come on. they will
never stand it. I am of your M\n&,said I, but what Course
must be done? Done! says he, let fifty of our Men advance
and flank them on each Wing, and encourage them, and
they will fight like brave Fellows in brave Company; but
without it they will every Man turn his Back. Immediate-
ly I rode up to our Leader, and told him, who was exact-
ly of our Mind; and accordingly fifty of us march'd to
the right Wing, and fifty to the left, and the rest made a
Line of Reserve; and so we march'd, leaving the last 200
Men to make another Body by themselves, and to guard
the Camels^ only that, if need were, they should send a
hundred Men to assist the last fifty.
I n a Word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable
Company they were; how many, we could not tell, but
10,000 we thought was the least : A Party of them came
on first, and view'd our Posture, traversing the Ground
in the Front of our Line; and as we found them within
Gun-shot, our Leader ordered the two Wings to advance
swiftly, and give them a Salvo on each Wing with their
Shot, which .was done; but they went off, and I suppose
went back to give an Account of the Reception they were
like to meet with; and indeed that Salute clogg'd their
Stomachs, for they immediately halted, stood a while to
consider of it, and wheeling oft to the left, they gave over
the Design, and faid no more to us for that time; which
was very agreeable to our Circumstances, which were but
very indifferent for a Battle with such a Number.
Two Days after this we came to the City Naunm, or
Naum; we thank'd the Governor for his Care for us, and
collected to the Value of 100 Crowns, or thereabouts,
which we gave to the Soldiers sent to guard us; and here
we rested one Day. This is a Garifbn indeed, and there
. . were
were 500 Soldiers kept here ; but the Reason of it Wa£
that formerly the Muscovite Frontiers lay nearer to them
than they do now, the Muscovites having abandon'd that
Part of the Country (which lies from this City West, for
about two hundred Miles.) as desolate and unfit for Use;
to send Troops thither. for its Defence; for we had yet
above two thoufand Miles to Muscovy, properly so call'd.
After this we ipass'd several great Rivers, and two
dreadful Deserts, one of -which we were sixteen Days- past-
ing over, and which, as I ssid, was to be called No Man's
Land; and on the 13th of April we came to the Frontiers
of the Muscovite Dominions. I think the first City, or
Town, or Fortress, whatever it might be call'd", that be-
long'd to the Czar of Muscovy,. was call'd Argun, being
on the West-Side of the River Argun.
I could not but discover an infinite Satisfaction, that
I was now arriv'd in, as I call'd it, a Christian Country, or
at least in a Country govern'd by Christians ; for tho' the
Muscovites do, in my Opinion, but just deserve the Name of
Christians, yet such.they pretend to be, and are very de-
vout in their Way. It would certainly occur to any Man
who travels the World as I have done, and who had any
Power of Reflection; I sey, it would occur to him, to
reflect what a Blessing it is to be brought into the World
where the Name of God, and of a Redeemer is known,
worshipped and ador'd, and not where the People, given up
by Heaven to strong Delusions, worship the Devil, and
prostrate themselves to Stocks and Stones; worship Mon-
sters, Elements, horrible shaped Animals, and Statues, or
Images of Monsters: Not a Town or City we pass'd thro',
but had their Pagods, their Idols, and their Temples, and
ignorant People worshipping even the Works of their own
Hands.
N o w we came where at least a Face of the Christian
Worship appear'd, where the Knee was bow'd to Jesus;
and whether ignorantly or not, yet the Christian Religion
was own'd, and the Name of the true God was call'd up-
on, and adored; and it made the very Recesses of my Soul
rejoice to fee it: I faluted the brave Scots Merchant I men-
tioned above, with my first Acknowledgment of this; and,
taking him by the Hand, I faid to him, Blessed be God, we
are once again come among Christians. He smiled, and
answered, Do not rejoice too soon, Countryman; these

nd so difficult
Mus-
Muscovites are but an odd Sort of Christians ; and but fof
the Name of it, you may fee very little of the Substance
for some Months sarther of our Journey.
Well, said I, but still 'tis better than Paganism, and
worshipping of Devils. Why, I'll tell you, says he, except
the Ruj/san Soldiers in Garifons, and a few of the Inhabi-
tants of the Cities upon the Road, all the rest of this Coun-
try, for above a thousand Miles sarther, is inhabited by the
worst, and most ignorant of Pagans; and so indeed we
found it.
W e were now launched into the greatest Piece of solid
Earth, if I understand any thing of the Sursace of the
Globe, that is to be found in any Part of the World; we
had at least twelve hundred Miles to the Sea, Eastward ; we
had at least two thousand to the Bottom of the Baltick Sea,
Westward; and almost three thousand Miles, if we left that
Sea, and went on West to the British and Tr.nch Chanels;
we had full five thousand Miles to the Indian, or Perjian
Sea, South; and about eight hundred Miles to the Frozen
Sea, North; nay, if some People may be believed, there
might be no Sea North-East, till we came round the Pole,
and consequently into the North-West. and so had a Con-
tinent of Land iato America, no Mortal knows where;
tho' I could give some Reasons, why I believe that to be
a Mistake too.
As we enter'd into the Muscovite Dominions, a good
while before we came to any considerable Town, we had
nothing to observe there but this; first, that all the Rivers
run to the East. As I understood by the Charts which
some of our Caravan had with them, it was plain, that all
those Rivers ran into the great River Xamour, or Gam-
mour. This River, by the natural Course of it, must run
into the East Sea, or Chinese Ocean. The Story they tell
us, that the Mouth of this River is choak'd up with Bull-
rushes of a monstrous Growth, (viz.) three Foot about,
and twenty or thirty Foot high, I must be allow'd to say,
I believe nothing of; but as its Navigation is of no Use,
because there is no Trade that Way, the Tartars, to whom
alone it belongs, dealing in nothing but Cattle, so nobody
that ever I heard of, has been curious enough, either to go
down to the Mouth of it in Boats, or come up from the
Mouth of it in Ships; but this is certain, that this River
runn ng due East, in the Latitude of 60 Degrees, carries 3
vast Concourse of Rivers along with it, and finds an
Ocean,
Ocean, to empty itself in that Latitude; so we are sure of
Sea there.
Some Leagues to the North of this River, there are fe'
veral considerable Rivers, whose Streams run as due North
as the Xamour runs East; and these are all found to join
their Waters with the great River Tartarus, named so
from the northermost Nations of the Mongul Tartars,
who the Chinese say, were the first Tartars in the World;
and who, as our Geographers alledge, are the Cog and Ma-
gog, mention'd in sacred Story.
These Rivers running all Northward, as well as all
the other Rivers, I am yet to speak of, make it evident,
that the Northern Ocean bounds the Land also on that
Side; so that it does not seem rational in the least to think,
that the Land can extend itself to join with America. on
that Side, or that there is not a Communication between
the Northern and the Eastern Ocean; but of this I shall
say no more, it was my Observation at thac Time, and
therefore I take Notice of it in this Place. We now ad-
vanced from the River Arguna by easy and moderate Jour-
nies, and were very visibly oblig'd to the Care the C7.ar of
Muscovy has taken to have Cities and Towns built in as
. many Places as are possible to place them, where his Sol-
diers keep Garison something like the Stationary Soldiers
plac'd by the Romans in the remotest Countries of their
Empire, some of which I had read were particularly plac'd
- in Britain for the Security ot Commerce, and for the Lodg-
ing of Travellers^ and thus it was here; for where-ever
we came, tho' at these Towns and Stations, the Garilons
and Governor were Ruffians, and profess'd Christians, yet
the Inhabitants of the Country were mere Pagans, sacri-
ficing to Idols, and worshipping the Sun, Moon, and Stars,
. or all the Host of Heave 1, and not only so, but were of
. all the Heathens and Pagans that ever 1 met with, the most
barbarous, except only that they did not eat Man's Flesh,
as our Savages of America did.
Som e Instances of this we met with in the Country
between Arguna, where we enter the Muscovite Domini-
ons, and a City of Tartars and Ruffians together, called
Nortzinskoy; in which Space is a continued Desart or Fo-
rest, which cost us twenty Days to travel over it. In a
Village near the last of those Places I had the Curiosity to
go and see their Way of Living, which is most brutish and
unsufferable; they had, I suppose, a great Sacrifice that
K 4 Day,
Day, for there stood out upon an old Stump of a Tree, air
Idol made of Wood, frightful as the Devil, at least as
any thing we can think of to represent the Devil, can ber
made; it had a Head certainly not so much as resembling
any Creature that the World ever faw; Ears as big as Goats
Horns, and as high; Eyes as big as a Crown Piece; a
Nose like a crooked Ram's Horn, and a Mouth extended
four-corner'd, like that of a Lion, with horrible Teeth,
hooked like a Parrot's under Bill; it was dressed up in the
filthiest Manner that you could suppose, its upper Garment
was of Sheep-Skins, with the Wool outward, a great Tartar
Bonnet on the Head, with two Horns growing through it;
it was about eight Foot high, yet had-no Feet or Legs, or
any other Proportion of Parts.
This Scarecrow was set up at the Outer-side of the
Village; and when I came near to it, there were sixteen or
seventeen Creatures, whether Men or Women I could not
tell, for they make no Distinction by their Habits, either of
Body or Head; these lay all fiat on the Ground, round
this formidable Block of shapeless Wood: I faw no Motion
among 'em any more than if they had been Logs of Wood
like their Idol; at first I really thought they had been so,
but when I came a little nearer, they started up upon
their Feet, and rais'd a howling Cry, as if it had been
so many deep-mouth'd Hounds, and walk'd away as if they
were displeas'd at our disturbing them. A little way off
from this Monster, and at the Door of a Tent or Hut, made
all of Shecps-Skins, and Cow-Skins, dry'd, stood three
Butchers, I thought they were such; for when I came nearer
to them, I found they had long Knives in their Hands, and
in the Middle of the Tent appear'd three Sheep kill'd, and
one young Bullock or Steer. These, it seems, were Sacri-
fices to that senseless Log of an Idol, and these three Men,
Priests belonging to it; and the 17 prostrated Wretches,
were the People who brought the Offering, and were
making their Prayers to that Stock.
I confess, I was more mov'd at their Stupidity and
this brutish Worship of a Hobgoblin, than ever I was at
any thing in my Life; to see God's most glorious and best
Creature, to whom he had granted so many Advantages,
even by Creation, above the rest of the Works of his Hands,
vested with a reasonable. Soul, and that Soul adorn'd with
Faculties and Capacities, adapted both to honour his Maker,
and be honoured by him; I say, to fee it funk and degene-
rated
fated to a Degree so more than stupid, as to prostrate it-
self to- a frightful Nothing, a mere imaginary Object, dresi'd
up by themselves, and made terrible to themselves by their
own Contrivance, adorn'd only with Clouts and Rags; and
that this should be the Effect of mere Ignorance, wrought
up into hellish Devotion by the Devil himself; who envy-
ing (ro his Maker) the Homage and Adoration of his Crea-
tures, had deluded them into such gross, surfeiting, sordid
and brutish Things, as one would think should shock Na-
ture itself.
But what signified all the Astonishment and" Reflection
of Thoughts? thus it was, and I saw it before my Eyes,
and there was no room to wonder at it, or think it impos-
sible; all rsly Admiration turn'd to Rage, and I ro'e up td
the Image or Monster, call it what you will, and with my
Sword cut the Bonnet that was on its Head,in two in the
Middle, so that it hung down by one of the Horns; and
one of our Men, that was with me, took hold of the Sheep
Skin that cover'd it, add pull'd at it, when behold a most
hidious Outcry and Howling ran thro' the Village, and two
or three hundred People came about my Ears, so that I
was glad to scour for it; for we saw some had Bows and
Arrows; but I resolv'd from that Moment to visit theni
again.
Our Caravan'rested three Nights at the Town, which
was about four Miles off, in order to provide some' Horses
which they wanted, several of the Horses having been
lamed and jaded, with the Badness of the Way, and our long
March over the last Desert; so we had some Leisure - here
to put my Design in Execution. I communicated my Pro-
ject-to the Scots Merchant of Mufcow', of whose Courage
I had h'ad sufficient Testimony, as above: I told him what
I' had seen, and with what Indignation I had since thought
that human Nature could be so degenerate : I told him, I
was resolv'd, if I' could get but four or five Men well
arm'd to go With me, to go and"destroy that vile, abomi-
nable Idol; to let them see that it had no Power to help
itself, and consequently could not' be an Object of Wor-
ship, or to be pray'd to, much lesi help them thacjoffer'd
Sacrifices to it.
H e laugh'd at me; fays he, Tour Zeal may be good. bttt
tshat do you propose td yourself by it? Propose .' said I, to
'vindicate the Honour of God, which is insulted by this De-vit-
Mrship. Biff how will if vindicate-the Honour of God? said
K f he,
he, while the People will not Be Me to know what you mean
by it, unless you could speak to them too, and tell them so,
and then they will fight you too, I'll assure you, for they art
desperate Fellows, and that especially in Desence of their Ido-
latry. Can we not, said I, do it in the Night, and then leavt
them the Reasons and Causes in Writing in their own Lan-
guage! Writings. says lie, wiry. there is not in five Nations
of them one Man that knows any thing of a Letter, or how
to read a Word in any Language, or in their own. Wretched
Ignorance'. said I to him; however, I have a great mind
to do it ., perhaps Nature may draw Inferences from it to 'em,
to let 'em see how brutifl) they are, to worstnp such horrid
Things. Look you, Sir, lays he, if your Zeal prompts you to
it so warmly, you must do it; but in the next Place I would
have you consider, these wild Nations of People are subjected by
Force to the Czar of MuscovyV Dominions; and if you do
thit, 'tis ten to one but they will come by Thousands to the
Governor of Ncrtzinskay, and complain, and demand Satis-
saction; and if he cannot give them Satissaction, 'tis ten to
one but they revolt, and it will occasion a new'.War with
all the Tartars in the Country.
This, I conless, put new Thoughts into my Head fora
while; but I harp'd upon the lame String still, and all that
D^y I was uneasy to put my Project in Execution: To-
wards the Evening the Scots Merchant met me by Acci-
dent in our Walk about the Town, and desir'd to speak
with me; I believe, fays he, 1 have put you off of your
good Di sign; I have been a little concern'd about it since,
for I abhor the Idol and Idolatry, as much as you can do.
Truly, said I, you have put it off a little as to the Execu-
tion of it, but you have not put it all out of my Thoughts;
and I believe J shall do it still before I quit this Place, tho'
I were to be deliver'd up to them for Satissaction. No,
no, says he, God forbid they should deliver you up to such
a Crew of Monsters; they shall not do that neither, that
would be murdering you indeed. Why, said I, how would
they use me? Use you! says he, I'll tell you how they
serv'd a poor Kussan, who affronted them in their Wor-
ship just as you did, and who they took Prisoner; after
they had lam'd him with an Arrow that he could not run
away, they took him and stripp'd him stark-naked,and set
him upon the Top of the Idol-Monster, and stood all round
him, and shot as many Arrows into him as would stick
over his whole Body, and then they burnt him, and all the
Arrows
Arrows sticking in him, as a Sacrifice to the Idol. And was
this the fame Idol, said I > Yes, says he, the very lame. Well,
said I, I'll tell you a Story; so I related the Story of our
Men at Madagascar, and how they burnt and fack'd the
Village there, and kill'd Man, Woman and Child, for their
murdering one of our Men, just as it is related before; and
when I had done, I added, that I thought we ought to do
ib to this Village.
H e listen'd very attentively to the Story; but when I
talk'd of doing so to that Village, says he, You mistake
very much ; it was not this Village, it was almost a hundred
Miles from this Place, but it was the lame Idol, for they
carry him about in Procession all over the Country. Well,.
said I, then that Idol ought to be punish'd for it, and it
shall, said I, if I live this Night out.
In a Word, finding me resolute, he lik'd the Design, and/
told me I should not go alone, but he would go with me;
but he would go first, and bring a stout Fellow, one
of his Countrymen, to go also with us; and one, says he,
as famous for his Zeal as you can desire any one to be,
against such devilish Things as these: In a Word he brought
me his Comrade, a Scotsman, whom he call'd Captain Ri*
chardson, and I gave him a full Account of what I had
seen, and also of what I intended; and he told me readily,
he would go with me, if it cost him his Life: so we
agreed to go only we three. I had indeed propos'd it to my
Partner, but he declin'd it; he faid, he was ready to assist
me to the utmost, and upon all Occasions for my Defence;
but that this was an Adventure quite out of his Way; so,
I say, we resolv'd upon our Work, only we three, and my
Man-Servant, and to put it in Execution that Night about
Midnight, with all the Secrecy imaginable.
However, upon second Thoughts, we were willing to
delay it till the next Night, because the Caravan being to
set forward in the Morning, we supposed the Governor
could not pretend to give 'em any Satisfaction upon us when
we were out of his Power; the Scots Merchant, as steady in
his Resolution to enterprize it, as bold in executing, brought
me ^Tartar's Robe or Gown of Sheep-Skins, and a Bonnet,
with a Bow and Arrows, and had provided the fame for -
himself and his Countryman, that the People, if they law
us, should not be able to determine who we were.
All the first Night we spent in mixing up some com-
bustible Matter with Aquavitae, Gun-powder, and such
K 6 other
other Miterials as we could get, and having a good Quan-
tity of Tar in a little Pot, about an Honr after Night we
set out upon our Expedition.
We came to the Place about eleven o'Clock at Night,
and found that the People had not the least Jealousy of
Danger attending their Idol; the Night was cloudy, yet the
Moon gave us Light enough to fee that the Idol stood just in
the same Posture and Place that it did before: The People
seemed to be all at their Rest, only, that in the great Hut,
or Tent, as we call'd it, where we sew the three Priests,
whom we mistook for Butchers, we saw a Light, and going
up close to the Door, we heard People talking, as if there
.were five or fix of them; we concluded therefore, that if
we set Wildfire to the Idol, these Men would come out
immediately, and run up to the Place to reseue- it from
the Destruction that we intended for it, and what to do
with them we knew not; once we thought of carrying it
away, and setting Fire to it at a Distance; but when we
came to handle it, we found it too bulky for our Carriage-,
so we were at a Loss again: The second Scotsman was Iof
setting Fire to the Tent or Hut, and knocking the Crea-
tures that were there on the Head, when they came out}
but I could not join with that; I was against killing 'errr,
if it was polSble to be avoided. Well then, said the Scats
Merchant, I'll tell you what we will do, we will try to
take them Prisoners, tie their Hands, and make them stand
and see their Idol destroy'd.
As it happen'd, we had Twine or Packthread enough
about us, which was used to tie our Fire-works together
with; so we resolv'd to attack these People first, and with
as little Noise as we could: The first Thing we did, we
knock'd attheDoor, when one of the Priests coming to the
Door, we immediately seized upon him, stopp'd his Mouth,
and ty'd his Hands behind him, and led him to the Idol*
where we gagg'd him that he might not make a Noise;
ty'd'his Feet alib together, and left him on the Ground.
Two of us then waited at the Door, expecting that
another would come out to see what the Matter was; but
we waited so long till the third Man came back to us;
and then no body coming out, we knock'd again gently,
and immediately out came two more, and we serv'd them
just in the same Manner, but were oblig'd to go. all with
them, and lay them down by the Idol some Distance from
©ne. another; when going back, we found two -more were
come.
come out to the Door, and a third stood behind 'em with*
in the Door: We seiz'd the two, and immediately ty'd
them, when the third stepping back, and crying out, my
Scots Merchant went in after him, and taking out a Com-
position we had made, that would only srooak and stink,
he set Fire to it, and threw it in among them; by that
time the other Scotsman and my Man, taking Charge of
the two Men already bound, and ty'd together also by the
Arm, led'them away to the Idol, and left them there, to see
if their Idol would relieve them, making haste back to us. .
W hen the Fuze we had'thrown in had fill'd the Hut
with so much Smoak, that they were almost suffocatedf
we then threw in a small Leather Bag of another Kind*
which flam'd like a Candle, and following it in, we found
there were but four People left, who, it seems, were two
Men and two Women, and, as we supposed, had been about
some of their Diabolick Sacrifices: They appear'd, in short) -»
frighted to Death, at least so as to sit trembling and stupid,
and not able to-speak neither, for the Smoak.
In a Word, we took them, bound them as we had the
other, and all without any Noise: I should have said, we
brought them out of the House or Hut first; for indeed
we were not able to bear the Smoak any more than they
were. When we had done this, we carry'd them all to-
gether to the Idol; when we came there, we fell to work
with him; and first we daub'd him all over, and his Robes
also, with Tar, and such other Stuff as we had, which was
Tallow mrx'd with Brimstone; then we stopped his Eyes,
and Ears, and Mouth full of Gun-powder, then we wrapp'd
up a great Eiece of Wildfire in his Bonnet; and thea
sticking all the Combustibles we had brought with us upon
him, welook'd about to fee if we could find any thing
else to help to burn him; when my Scotsman remembred,
that by the Tent or Hut where the Men were, there lay
a Heap of dry Forage, whether Straw or Rushes I do not
remember; away he and the other Scotsman- run, and
fetch'd their Arms full of that: When we had done this,
we took all our Prisoners, and brought them, having un*
ty'd their Feet, and ungagg'd their Mouths, and made them
stand up, and set them just before their monstrous Idol,,
and then ,set Fire to the whole.
We staid by-it a Quarter of an Hour, or thereabouts-,
till the Powder in the Eyes, and Mouth, and Ears of the
Mot blew-up, and,. as. we could perceive,. had sglit and de,
formed-
formed the Shape of it; and in a Word, 'till we saw it burn
into a mere Block or Log of Wood; and then setting the
dry Forage to it, we found it would be soon quite consum'd,
so we began to think of going away; but the Scotsman said,
No, we must not go, for thele poor deluded Wretches will
all throw themselves into the Fire, and burn themselves
with the Idol; so we resolved to stay till the Forage was
burnt down too, and then we came away and left them.
I n the Morning we appear'd among our Fellow Tra-
vellers, exceeding busy in getting ready for our Journey;
nor could any Man suggest that we had been any-where
but in our Beds, as Travellers might be suppos'd to be, to
fit themselves for the Fatigues of that Day's Journey.
But it did not end so; for the next Day came a great
Multitude of the Country People, not only of this Village,
but of a hundred more, for ought I know, to the Town-
Gates, and in a most outrageous Manner, demanded Satis-
saction of the Ruffian Governor, for the insulting their
Priests, and burning their Great Cham-Cbi-Thattngu, such
a hard Name they gave the monstrous Creature they wor-
shipp'd ; the People of Kertzinskay, were at first in a great
Consternation, for, they said, the Tartars were no less
than thirty thousand, and that in a few Days more, they
would be one hundred thousand strong.
The Ruffian Governor sent out Messengers to appease
them, and gave 'em all tho good Words imaginable: He
assured them he knew nothing of it, and that there had
not a Soul of his Garison been abroad: That it could not
be from any body there, and if they would let him know
who it was, they should be exemplariJy punished. They
rcturn'd haughtily, that all the Country reverenced the
Great Chem-Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the Sun, and no
Mortal would have decreed to offer Violence to his Image,
but some Christian Miscreant, so they call'd them, it seems;
and they therefore denoune'd War against him, and all the
Ruffians, who, they said, were Miscreants and Christians.
The Governor, still patient, and unwilling to make a
Breach, or to have any Cause of War alledged to be given
by him, the Czar having straitly charged him to treat
the conquer'd Country with Gentleness and Civility, gave
them still all the good Words he could; at last he told
'em, there was a Caravan gone towards RuJJia that Morn-
ing, and perhaps it was some of them, who had done 'em
this Injury; and that if they would be satisfy'd with that,
he would send after them, to inquire into it. This seem'd
to appease them a little; and accordingly the Governor
sent after us, and gave us a particular Account how the
Thing was; intimating withal, that if any in our Caravan
had done it, they should make their Escape; but that, whe-
ther they had done it or no, we should make all the Haste
forward that was possible; and that, in the mean time, he
would keep them in play as long as he could.
This was very friendly in the Governor; however,
when it came to the Caravan, there was no body knew
any thing of the Matter, and as for us that were guilty,
we were the least of all suspected; none so much as ask'd
us the Question; however, the Captain of the Caravan, for
the Time, took the Hint that the Governor gave us, and
we marched or travelled two Days and two Nights, with-
out any considerable Stop, and then we lay at a Village
"call'd Vlothus; nor did we make any long Stop here, but
hastened on towards Jurarcina, another of the Czar of
Muscovy's Colonies, and where we expected we should be
fafe; but it is to be observed, that here we began, for two
or three Days March, to enter upon a vast nameless Defart,
of which I shall fay more in its Place; and which, if we
had now been upon it, 'tis more than probable, we had
been all destroy'd: It was the second Days March from
I'lot bus, that by the Clouds of Dust behind us at a great
Distance, some of our People began to be sensible we were
pursued; we had enter'd the Defart, and had pass'd by a
great Lake, call'd Schaks Ofer, when we perceiv'd a very
great Body of Horse appear on the other Side of the Lake
to the North, we travellmg West: We observ'd they went
away West as we did, but had supposed we would have
.taken that Side of the Lake, whereas we very happily
took the South-Side; aud in two Days more we faw them
not, for they believing we were still before them, push'd
on, till they came to the River UJJa; this is a very great
River when it pastes farther North, but where we came
to it, we found it narrow, and fordable.
The third Day they either found their Mistake, or had
Intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us, towards
the Dusk of the Evening. We had, to our great Satisfac-
tion, just pitch'd upon a Place for our Camp, which was
very convenient for the Night; for as we were upon a
Defart, though but at the Beginning of it, that was above
five hundred Miles over, we had no Towns to lodge at,
Shd indeed expected none but the City Jamwenit, whicfs
we had yet two Days March to; the Defart, however,
had some few Woods in it on this Side, and little Rivers,
which- ran all into the great River Udda: It was in a nar-
row Strait between two little, but very thick Woods, thac
we pitch'd our little Camp for that Night, expecting to be
attack'd in the Night.
N o body knew but ourselves, what we were pursoed for;
but as it was usual for the Mongul Tartars to go about in
Troops in that Defart, so the Caravans always fortify them-
selves every Night against them, as against Armiesof Rob-
bers; and it was therefore no new Thing; to be pursoed.
B u t we had this Night, of all the Nights of our Tra-
vels, a most advantageous Camp; for we lay between two
Woods, with a little Rivulet running just before our Front;
so that we could not be surrounded, or attack'd any way;
but in our Front or Rear; we took care also to make our
Front as strong as wecould, by placing our Packs, with
our Camels and Horses, all in a Line on the Inside of the
River, and we fell'd some Trees in our Rear.
In this Posture we encamp'd for the Night, but the*
Enemy was upon us before we had finish'd our Situation:
They did not come orr'us like Thieves, as we expected,
but sent three Messengers to us, to demand the Men to be
delivered to them, that had abused their Priests, and burnt
their God Cham-Chi-Thaungu, that they might burn them
with Fire; and upon this, they faid, they would go away,
and do us no further harm, otherwise they would burn us
all with Fire. Our Men look'd very blank at this Message,
and began; to stare at one another, to see who look'd with
most Guilt in'trieir Faces; but no body was the Word, no
body did it. The Leader of the Caravan sent word, he
was well aflur'd it was not done by any of our Camp-;
that we were peaceable Merchants travelling on our Bu-
siness;- that we had done no harm to them, or to anyone
else; and therefore they must look farther tor their 1 Ene-
mies, who had injur'd them; for we were not the Peo-
ple; so defir'd them not to disturb us, for if they did, we
should defend ourselves.
They were far from being fatisfy'd with this for an
Answer, and a great Crowd of them came down in the
Morning by break of Day to our Camp; but seeing us in
siich an advantageous Situation, they durst come no far-
ther than* the Break in our Front-, where they stood atrd
shewed
fliew'd us such a Number, that indeed terrify'd us very
much, for those that spoke least of them, spoke of ten
thousand. Here they stood and loook'd at us a while, and
then setting up a great Howli they let fly a Gloud of Ar-
rows among us; but we were well enough fortify'd for
that, for we shclter'd under our Baggage, and I do not
remember that 'one Man of us was hurt.
Some time after this, we law them move a little to
our Right. and expected them on the Rear, when a cun-
ning Fellow, a Cassock, as they call them, of farawena, in
the Pay of the Muscovites, calling to the Leader of the Ca-
ravan, said to him, I'll go send all these People away to
Sibeilka; this was a City four or five Days Journey, at least,
to the South, and rather behind us: So he takes his Bow
and Arrows, and getting on Horseback, he rides away from
our Rear directly, as it were, back to Nertfinskay; after
this, he takes a great Circuit about, and comes to the Army
of the Tartars, as- if he had been sent Express to tell
them a long Story, that the People who had burnt the
Cham-Chi-Thaungu, were gone to Sibeilka, witha Caravan
of Miscreants, as he call'd them, that is to say, 'Christians,
and that they were resolv'd to burn the God ichal-Isar,
belonging to the Tougue/es.
As this Fellow was him self a mere Tartar, and perfectly
spoke their Language, he counterfeited so well, that they
all took it from him, and away they drove, in a most vio-
lent Hurry, to Sibeilka, which, it seems, was five Days
Journey to the South, and in less than three Hours they
were intirely out of our Sight, and we never heard any
more of them, nor ever knew whether they went to that
other Place call'd Sibeilka, or no.
S o we pass'd safely on to the City of Jarawena, where
there was a Garison of Muscovites; and there we rested five
Days, the Caravan being exceedingly satigued with the last
Days hard March, and with want of Rest in the Night.
From this City we had a frightful Desart, which held
us three and twenty Days March. We furnished ourselves
with some Tents here, for the better accommodating our-
selves in the Night; and the Leader ot the Caravan pro-
cured sixteen Carriages or Waggons of the Country, for
carrying ourWater and Provisions, and these Carriages were
our Defence every Night round our little Camp; so that had
the Tartars appear'd, unless they had been very numerous
indeed, they would not have been abie to hurt us.
Ws
We may well be supposed to want Rest again after this
long Journey; for ir> this Defart we saw neither House
or Tree, or scarce a Bush; we faw indeed abundance of
the Sable Hunters, as they call'd them; these are all Tartan
of the Mongul Tartary, of which this Country is a Part,
and they frequently attack small Caravans; but we saw no
Numbers of them together. I was curious to see the Sa-
ble Skins they catch'd, but I could never speak with any of
them, for they durst not come near us, neither durst we
straggle from our Company, to go near them.
After we had pass'd this Defart, we came into a
Country pretty well inhabited; that is to fay, we found
Towns and Castles settled by the Czar of Muscovy, with
Garisons of Stationary Soldiers to protect the Caravans,
and defend the Country against the Tartars, who would
otherwise make it very dangerous travelling; and his Cza-
rish Majesty has given such strict Orders for the well guard-
ing the Caravans and Merchants, that if there are any Tar-
tars heard of in the Country, Detachments of the Garisons
are always sent to fee Travellers fafe from Station to Station.
And thus the Governor of Adinskoy, who I had Oppor-
tunity to make a Visit to, by means of the Scots Merchant,
who was acquainted with him, offer'd us a Guard of so Men,
if we thought there was any Danger to the next Station.
I thought long before this, that as we came nearer to
Europe, we should find the Country better peopled, and the
People more civilized; but I found myself mistaken in
both, for we had yet the Nation of the Tongueses to pass
through; where we faw the fame Tokens of Paganism and
Barbarity, or worse, than before; only as they were con-
quer'd by the Muscovites, and intirely reduced, they were
not so dangerous; but for Rudeness of Manners, Idolatry,
and Multitheism, no People in the World ever went beyond
them: They are cloathed all in Skins of Beasts, and their
Houses are built of the fame: You know not a Man from
a Woman, neither by the Ruggedness of their Countenances
or their Cloaths; and in the Winter, when the Ground is
cover'd with Snow, they live under Ground in Houses like
Vaults, which have Cavities or Caves going from one to
another.
I f theTartars had their Cham-Chi-Thaungu for a whole
Village or Country, these had Idols in every Hut, and every
Cave; besides they worship the Stars, the Sun, the Water,
the
the Snow, and, in a Word, every thing that they do not un-
derstand, and they understand but very little; so that almost
every Element,every uncommon thing, sets them a sacrificing,
B u t I am no more to describe People than Countries,
any sarther than my own Story comes to be concerned in 'em:
I met with nothing peculiar to myself in all this Country,
which I reckon was from the Desart, which I spoke of last,
at least 400 Miles, half of it being another Desart, which
took us up twelve Days severe travelling, without House,
Tree, or Bush, but were oblig'd again to carry our own
Provisions, as well Water as Bread. After we were out of
this Desart, and had travelled two Days, we came to Ja-
nezay, a Muscovite City or Station, on the great River Ja-
nex.ay: This River, they told us, parted Europe from Asm,
tho'our Map-makers, as I am told, do not agree to it show-
ever it is certainly the Eastern Boundary of the ancient Sibe-
ria, which now makes up a Province only of the vast
Muscovite Empire, but is itself equal in Bigness to the
whole Empire of Germany.
A n d yet here 1 observed Ignorance and Paganism still
prevailed, except in the Muscovite Garisons; all the Coun-
try between the River Oby and the River Janezay is as
intirely Pagan, and the People as barbarous, as the re-
motest of the Tartars, nay as any Nation for ought I know
in Asia or America. I also found, which I observed to
the Muscovite Governors who I had Opportunity to con-
verse with, that the Pagans are not |much the wiser or the
nearer Christianity for being under the Muscovite Govern-
ment; which they acknowledged was true enough, but,
they said, it was none of their Business: That if the Czar
expected to convert his Siberian, or Tonguese, or Tartar
Subjects, it should be done by sending Clergymen among
them, not Soldiers; and they added, with more Sincerity
than I expected., that they found it was not so much the
Concern of thair Monarch to make the People Christians,
as it was to make them Subjects.
From this River to the great River Oby, we cross'd a
wild uncultivated Country; I cannot say 'tis a barbarous
Soil; 'tis only barren of People, and good Management,
otherwise it is in itself a most pleasant, fruitful and agree-
able Country. What Inhabitants we found in it are all
Pagans, except such as are sent among them from Rujfia;
for this is the Country I mean on both Sides the River Oby,
whither the Muscovite Criminals, that are not put to Death,
are
we banished, and from whence it is next to impossible
they should ever come away.
I h a v e nothing material to say of my particular Af-
sairs, till I came to ToMski, the Capital City of Siberia,
where I continued some Time on the following Occasion.
We had been now almost seven Months on our Jour-
ney, and Winter began to come on apace; whereupon my
Partner and I call'd a Council about our particular Affairs,
in which we found it proper, considering that we were
bound tor England, and not for Moscow, to consider how
to dispose of ourselves: They told us of Sledges and Rairf-
Deer to carry us over the Snow in the Wintei-Time; and
indeed they have such things, that it would be incredible to
relate the Particulars of, by which Means the Ruffians tra-
vel more in the Winter than they can in Summer, because
in these Sleds they are able-to run Night and Day; the
Snow being frozen, is one universal Covering to Nature,
by which the Hills, the Vales, the Rivers, the Lakes, all
are smooth, and hard as a Stone, and they run upon the
8ursace, without any Regard to what is underneath.
- Buavl^had no Occasion to .push at a Winter Journey of
this Kind; \ was bound to England, not to Moscow, and
my Route lay two Ways, either I must go on as the Ca-
ravan went, till I came to Jeroslow, and then go off West
for Narva, and the Gulph of Finland, and so either by Sea
or Land to Dantidck, where I might possibly fell my Chi-
na Cargo to good Advantage, or I must leave the Cara-
van at a little Town on the Dwina, from whence I had
but six Days by Water to Arch-Angel, and from thence
might be sur,e of Shipping, either to England, Holland, or
Hamburgh.
Now to go any of these Journies in the Winter, would
have been preposterous ; for as to Dantzick, the Baltick
would be frozen up, and I could not get Passage; and to
go by Land in thole Countries, was sar less safe than among
the Mongul Tartars; likewise to Arch-Angel in October, all
the Ships would be gone from thence, and even the Mer-
chants, who dwell there in Summer, retire South to Mos-
cow in the Winter, when the Ships are gone; so that I should
have nothing but Extremity of Cold to encounter, with a
Scarcity of Provisions, and mustlie therein an empty Town
all the Winter: So that upon the Whole, I thought it much
my_ better Way to let the Caravan go, and to make Pro-
vision to winter where I was, (viz.) at Tobolski in Siberia,
in the Latitude of sixty Degrees, where I was sure of three
Things to wear out a cold Winter with, (fiz.) Plenty of
Provision, such as the Country afforded, a warm House,
with Fuel enough, and excellent Company; of all which
I shall give a full Account in its Place.
I was now in a quite different Climate from my be-
lov'd Island, where I never felt Cold, except when I had
my Ague; on the contrary, I had much to do to bear
any Cleaths on my Back, and never made any Fire but
without Doors, and for my Necessity, in dressing my Food,
C^cNow I made me three good Vests, with large Robes or
Gowns over them to hang down to the Feet, and button
close to the Wrists, and all these lin'd with Furs to make
them sufficiently warm.
A s to a warm House, I must confess I greatly dislike
our Way in England, ot making Fires in every Room in
the House, in open Chimnies, which when the Fire was
out,always kept the Air in the Room cold as the Climate:
But taking an Apartment in a good House in the Town,
I ordered a Chimney to be built like aFurnace, in the Cen-
ter of six several Rooms, like a Stove, the Funnel to carry
the Smoak went up one Way, the Door to come at the Fire
went in another, and ail the Rooms were kept equally warm,
but no Fire seen; likens they heat the Bagnio's in England.
B y this Means we had always the same Climate in all the
Rooms, and an equal Heat was preserved; and how cold
soever it wus without,it was always warm within,and yet we
iaw no Fire, nor were ever incommoded with any Smoak.
The most wonderful Thing of all was, that it should
be possible to meet with good Company here, in a Country sb
barbarous as that of the most Northerly Parts ot Europe,
near the frozen Ocean, and within but a very few Degrees
of Nova Zembla.
But this being the Country where the State Criminals
of Muscovy, as I observed before, are all banished; this City
was full ot' Noblemen, Princes, Gentlemen, Colonels, and
in ssiort all Degrees of the Nobility, Gentry, Soldiery and
Courtiers of Muscovy-: Here were the samous Prince Galilf-
hen, or Galoffken, and his Son, the old General Robostiski, and
several other Persons of Note, and some Ladies.
By Means of my Scots Merchant, who nevertheless I
parted with here, I made an Acquaintance here with seve-
ral of these Gentlemen, and some of them of the first Rank,
and from these, in the long Winter-Nights in which 1 staid
here,
here, I received several agreeable Visits. It was talking one
Night with a certain Prince, one of the banish'd Ministers of
State belonging to the Czar of Muscovy, that my Talk of my
particular Cafe began : He had been telling me abundance
of fine Things of the Greatness, the Magnificence and Do-
minions, and the absolute Power of the Emperor of the
Ruffians. I interrupted him, and told him, I was a greater
and more powerful Prince, than ever the Czar of Muscovy
was, tho' my Dominions were not so large, or my Peo-
ple so many. The Russian Grandee look'd a little surpriz'd,
and fixing his Eyes steadily upon me, began to wonder
what I meant.
I told him, his Wonder would cease when I had explain'd
myself: First, / told him, I had the absolute Dispofal of the
Lives and Fortunes of all my Subjects: That notwithstand-
ing my absolute Power, I had not one Person difaffected to
my Government, or to my Person, in all my Dominions.
He shook his Head at that, and faid, there indeed I out-did
the Czar of Muscovy. I told him, That all the Lands in my
Kingdom were my own, and all my Subjects were not only
my Tenants, but Tenants at will: That they would all
sight for me to the last Drop; and that never Tyrant, for
such I acknowledge myself to be, was ever so univerfally be-
loved, and yet so horribly feared by his Subjects.
A f t 1 r amusing them with these Riddles in Government
for awhile, I open'd the Case, and told them the Story at
large of my living in the Island, and how I managed both
myself and the People there that were under me, just as I
have since minuted it down. They were exceedingly ta-
ken with the Story, and especially the Prince, who told me
with a Sigh, that the true Greatness of Life was to be Ma-
ster of ourselves; that he would not have exchanged such
a State as Life as mine, to have been Czar of Muscovy;
and that he sound more Felicity in the Retirement he
leem'd to be banish'd to there, than ever he found in the
highest Authority he enjoy'd in the Court of his Master the
Czar: That the Height of human Wisdom was to bring
our Tempers down to our Circumstances; and to make a
Calm within, under the Weight of the greatest Storm with-
out. When he came first hither, he said, he used to tear
the Hair from his Head, .and the Cloaths from his Back,
as others had done before him; but a little Time and Con-
sideration had made him look into himself, as well as round
himself, to Things without; That he found the Mind of
Mao,
2
Man, if it was but once brought to reflect upon the State
of universal Life, and how little' this World was concern'd
in its true Felicity, was perfectly capable of making a Fe-
licity for itself, fully satisfying to itself, and suitable to its
own best Ends and Desires, with but very little Assistance
from the World: That Air to breathe in, Food to sustain
Life, Cloaths for Warmth, and Liberty for Exercise, in order
to Health, completed, in his Opinion, all that the World
could do for us ; and tho' the Greatness, the Authority, the
Riches, and the Pleasures which seme enjoy'd in the World,
and which he had enjoy'd his Share of, had much in them
that was agreeable to us, yet he observed that all those
things chiefly gratify'd the coarsest of our Affections; such
as our Ambition, our particular Pride, our Avarice, our
Vanity, and our Sensuality; all which were indeed the mere
Product of the worst Part of Man, were in themselves
Crimes, and had in 'em the Seeds of all manner of Crimes,
but neither were related to, or concern'd with any of those
Virtues that constituted us wise Men, or of those Graces
which distinguish'd us as Christians : That being now de-
priv'd of all the sancy'd Felicity, which he enjoy'd in the
full Exercise of all those Vices, he said, he was at leisure to
look upon the dark Side of them, where he found all man-
ner of Deformity; and was now convinced, that Virtue
only makes a Man truly wise, rich, and great, and pre-
serves him in the way to a superior Happiness in a future
State; and in this, he said, they were more happy in their
Banishment, than all their Enemies were, who had the full
Possession of all the Wealth and Power that they (the Ba-
nish'd) had left behind them.
Nor, Sir, says he, do I bring my Mind to this politically,
by the Necessity of my Circumstances, which some call mi-
serable; but if I know any thing of myself, I would not go
back, no not tho' my Master, the Czar, should call me, and
offer to re-instate me in all my former Grandeur; I say, I
would no more go back to it, than I believe my Soul when
it shall be deliver'd from this Prison of the Body, and has
had a Taste of the glorious State beyond Life, would come
back to the Gaol of Flesh and Blood it is now inclos'd in, and
leave Heaven to deal in the Dirt and Crime of human Affairs.
H e spoke this with so much Warmth in his Temper, so
much Earnestness and Motion of his Spirits, which were
apparent in his Countenance, that it was evident it was the
true Sense of his Soul; And indeed there was no Room to
doubt his Sincerity. X
I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a Mo-
narch in my old Station, of which I had given him an Ac-
count, but that I thought he was not a Monarch only, but
a great Conqueror; for that he that has got a Victory over
his own exorbitant Desires, and has the absolute Dominion
over himself, and whese Reason intirely governs his Will,
is certainly greats r than he that conquers a City: But, my
Lord, said I, shall I take the Liberty to ask you a Questi-
on? With all my Heart, says he; If the Door of your Li-
berty was open'd, said 1, would not you take hold of it to
deliver yourself from this Exile?
Hold, fays he, your Question is subtle, and requ res
some serious just Distinctions, to give it a sincere Answer i
and I'D give it you from the Bottom of my Heart. No-
thing that I know of in this World would move me to
deliver myself from this State of Banishment, except these
two i First, the Enjoyment of my Relations; and, secondly,
a little warmer Climate; but I protest to you, that to go
back to the Pomp of the Court, the Glory, the Power, the
Hurry of a Minister of State; the Wealth, the Gaiety, and
the Pleasures, that is to fay, Follies of a Courtier ,. if my
Master should fend me Word this Moment, that he restores
me to all he banish'd me from; I protest, If / know myself
at all, I would not leave this Wilderness, these D."larts,
and these frozen Lakes, for the Palace of Moscow.
B u t, my Lord, said I, perhaps you not only are banish'd
from the Pleasures of the Court, and from the Power, and
Authority, and Wealth you enjoy'd before; but you may
be absent too from some of the Conveniences of Life,
your Estate perhaps confiscated, and your Effects plunder'd,
and the Supplies left you here, may not be suitable to the
ordinary.Demands of Life.
A y, says he, that is as you suppose me to be a Lord, or
a Prince, &c. So indeed I am; but you are now to consi-
der me only as a Man; a human Creature, not at all di-
stinguish'd from another; and so I can suffer no Want,
unless I should be visited with Sickness and Distempers:
However, to put the Question out of Dispute; you leeotr
Manner; we are in this Place five Persons of Rank; we
live perfectly retired, as suited to a State of Banishment;
we have something rescu'd from the Shipwreck of our For-
tunes, which|keeps us from the mere Necessity of hunting
for our Food; but the poor Soldiers who are here, without
that Help, live in as much Plenty as we; They go into the
Woods
Woods, and catch Sables and Foxes; the Labour of a Month
will maintain them a Year; and as the Way of living is
not expensive, so it is not hard to get sufficient to our-
selves: So that Objection is out of Doors.
I have not Room to give a full Account of the most
agreeable Conversation I had with this truly Great Man;
in all which he shew'd, that his Mind was so inspir'd with
a superior Knowledge of Things, so supported by Religi-
on, as well as by a vast Share of Wisdom, that his Con-
tempt of the World was really as much as he had express'd,
and that lie was always the same to the last, as will appear
in the Story I am going to tell.
I h a d been here 8 Months, and a dark dreadful Winter
I thought it to be; the Coid was so intense, that I could not
so much as look abroad, without being wrapt in Furs, and.
a Mask of Fur before my Face, or rather a Hood.wiih on-
ly a Hole for Breath, and two for Sight : The little Day-
light we had, was, as we reckon'd, tor three Months, not #'«
above five Hours a Day, and six at most; only that the Snow
lying on the Ground continually, and the Weather clear, it
was never quite dirk: Our Horses were kept (or rather
slarv'd) under Ground; and as for our Servants, for we hir'd
Servants here to look after our Horses and selves, we had
every now and then their Fingers and Toes to thaw and
take care of, lest they should mortify and fell of.
It is true, within Doors we were warm, the Housesbe-
ing close, the Walls thick, the Lights small, and the Glass
all double: Our Food was chiefly.the Flesh of Deer dry'd
and cur'd in the Season; good Bread enough, but bak'd as
Biskets; dry'd Fish of several Sorts, and some Fksliof Mut-
ton, and of the Buffaloes, which is pretty good Beef. AU
the Stores of Provision for the Winter are laid up in the
Summer, apd well cur'd; our Drink was Water mix'd
with Aqua-Vita: instead of Brandy, and for a Treat, Mead
instead of Wine, which, however, they have excellent good.
The Hunters, who venture abroad all Weathers, frequently
brought us in fresh Venison, very sat and good; and some-
times Bears Flesh, but we did not much care for the last:
We had a good Stock of Tea, with which w.- treated our
Friends as above; and, in a Word, we livM very cheartuily
and well, all things consider'd.
I t was now March, and the Days grown considerably
longer, and the Weather at- least tolerable; so other Tra-
vellers began to prepare Sleds to carry them over the
L Snow>
Snow, and to get Things ready to be going; but my Mea-
sures being fix'd, as I have said, for Arch-Angel, and not
for Muscovy or the Baltick, I made no Motion; knowing
very well rhat the Ships from the South do not set out
for that Part of the World till May or June, and that if I
was thereat the Beginning of August, h would be as soon
as any Ships would be ready to go away; and therefore,
1 say, I made no Haste to be gone, as others did ; in a
Word, I saw a great many People, nay, all the Travellers
go away before me. It Teems, every Year they go from
thence to Moscow for Trade, (viz.) to carry Furs. and buy
Necessaries with them, which they bring back to furnish
their Shops; also others went on the same Errand to Arch-
Angel, but then they also being to come back again above
8oo Miles, went all out before me.
In short, about the latter End of May I began to make
all ready to pack up, and as I was doing this,' it occurr'd
to me. that seeing all these People were banished by the Czar
of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet when they came there, were
left at Liberty to go whither they would ; why did they
not then go away to any Part of the World where-ever
they thought fit? and I began to examine what should hin-
der them from making such an Attempt.
But my Wonder was over, when I entered upon that
Subject with the Person I have mentioned, who answered
me thus: Consider, first, Sir, says he, the Place where we
are; and, secondly, the Condition we are in; especially,
said he, the Generality of the People who are banished hi-
ther. We are surrounded, said he, with stronger things
than Bars and Bolts; on the N. Side is an unnavigablc Ocean,
where Ship never siil'd, and Eoat never swam; neither,
if we had both, could we know whither to go with them.
Every other way, said he, we have above ioco Miles to
pass thro' the Czar's own Dominions, and By-ways utter-
ly unpassable, except by the Roads made by the Govern-
ment, and thro' the Towns garison'd by his Troops; so
that we could neither pass undiscovered by the Road, or
subsist any other Way ; so that it is in vain to attempt it.
Iwas silene'd indeed at once, and found that they were
in a Prison, every sot as secure as if they had been lock'd
up iivthe Castle of Moscow; however, it came into ray
Thoughts, that I might certainly be made an Instrument
to procure the Escape of this excellent Person, and that
it was very easy for me to carry him away, there being no
Guard
Guard over him in the Country; and as 1 was not going
to Moscow, but to Arch-Angel, and that I went in the nature
of a Caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in the Sta-
tionary Towns in the Desart, but could encamp every Nigh*
where I would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to Arch-
Angel, where I would immediately secure him on board
an Enjish or Dutch Ship, and carry him. off safe along with
me; and as to his Subsistence and other Particulars, that should
be my Care, till he should better suppply himself.
He heard me very attentively, and look'd earnestly on me
all the while I spoke; nay, I could see in his very Face,
that what I laid put his Spirits into an exceeding Ferment;
his Colour frequently chang'd, his Eyes look'd red, and
his Heart flutter'd, that it might be even perceiv'd in his
Countenance ; nor could he immediately answer me, when
I had done, and as it were expected what he would say to
jt; and after he had paus'd a little, he embrae'd me, and said,
How unhappy are we! unguided Creatures as we are, that
even our greatest Acts of Friendship are made Snares to us,
and we are made Tempters of one another! My dear Friend,
said he. your Offer is so sincere, has such Kindness in it, is
&> disinterested in itself, and is so calculated for my Advan-
tage, that I must have very little Knowledge of the World,
if I did not both wonder at it, and acknowledge the Obli-
gation I have upon me to you for it: But did you believe I
was sincere in what I have so often said to you of my Con-
tempt of the World? Did you believe 1 spoke my very
Soul to you, and that I had really maintain'd that Degree or"
Felicity here, that had plac'd me above all that the World
could give me, or do for me? Did you believe I was sincere,
when I told you. I would not go back, if I was recalPd even
to be all that once I was in the Court, and with the Favour
qf the Czar my Master? Did you believe me, my Friend, to
be an honest Man, or did you think me to be a boasting
Hypocrite? Here he stopp'd, as if he would hear what I
wouldsay; but indeed I soon after perceiv'd, that he stopp'd
because his Spirits were in Motion, his Heart was fuil of
Struggles, and he could not go on. I was, I confess, asto-
nish'd at the Thing as well as at the Man, and I used some
Arguments with him to urge him to set himself tree:
That he ought to look upon this as a Door open'd by Hea-
ven for his Deliverance, and a Summons by Providence,
who has the Care and Disposition of all Events, to do him-
self good, and to render himself useful in the World.
L 2 He
He had by this Time recover'd himself. How do you
know, S\r, says he warmly, that instead of a Summons from
Heaven, it may be a Feint of another Instrument, repre-
senting in "all the alluring Colours to me the Shew of Feli-
city as a Deliverance, which may in itself be my Snare,
and tend directly to my Ruin: Here I am free from the
Temptation oi returning to my former miserable Greatness;
there I am not sure, but that all the Seeds of Pride, Ambi-
tion, Avarice and Luxury, which I know remain in Na-
ture, may revive and take Root, and in a Word, again
overwhelm me, and then the happy Prisoner who you see
now Master of his Soul's Liberty, shall be the miserable
Slave of his own Senses,. in the Full of all personal Liberty.
Dear Sir, let me remain in this blessed Confinement, banish'd
from the Crimes of Life, rather than purchase a Shew of
Freedom, at the Expenceofthe Liberty of my Reason, and
at the Expenceof the future Happiness which now I have in
my View, but shall then I fear, quickly lose Sight ofi for I
am but Flesh, a Man, a mere Man, have Passions and Affecti-
ons as likely to possess and overthrow me as any Man: O
be not my Friend and my Tempter both together!
I f t was sutpriz'd before, I was quite dumb now, and
stood lilenr, looking at him, and indeed admir'd at what I
law; the Struggle in his Soul was so great, that though
the Weather was extremely cold, it put him into a most
violent Sweat, and I found he wanted to give Vent to his
Mind; so I faid a Word or two, that I would leave him
to consider of it, and wait on him again, and then I with-
drew to my own Apartment.
About two Hours after I heard some body at, or near
the Door of the Room, and I was going to open the Door,
but he had open'd it, and came in: My dear Friend,/sry; he,
you had almost overset me, but I am recover'd -, do not take
it ill that I do not close with your Offer; I assure you, 'tis
not for Want of a Sense of the Kindness of it in you, and I
came to make the most sincere Acknowledgment of it to
you; but I hope I have got the Victory over myself.
M y Lord, said I, I hope you are fully fatisfy'd that you
do not resist the Call of Heaven. Sir,said he, if ithad been
from Heaven, the fame Power would have influenced me
to accept it; but I hope, and am fully fatisfy'd, that it is
from Heaven that I decline it, and 1 have an infinite Satis-
faction in the Parting, that you stall leave me an honest
Man stiil, tho' not a free Man.
I
Ikad nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make Pro-
fessions to him ot" my having no End in it, but a sincere De-
sire to serve him. He embraced me very passionately, and
assur'd me, he was sensible of that, and should always ac-
knowledge it, and with that he offer'd me a very fine Pre-
sent of Sables, too much indeed for me to accept from a
Man in his Circumstances, and I would have avoided them,
but he would not be refused.
The next Morning I sent my Servant to his Lordship,
with a small Present of Tea, 2 Pieces of China. Damask, and
4 little Wedges of Japan Gold, which did not all weigh
above 6 Oz. or thereabout, but were far short of the Value
of his Sables, which, indeed, when I came to England, I
found worth near 200 /. He accepted the Tea, and 1 Piece
of the Damask, and 1 of the Pieces .of Gold, wh.ch had a
fine Stamp upon it, of the Japan Coinage, which I found he
took for the Rarity of it, but would not take any more; and
sent word by my Servant, that he desired to speak with me..
When I came tohim, he told me, I knew what had pass'd
between us, and hop'd I would not move him any more:
in that Affair; but that since I made such a generous Offer
to him, heask'dme, if I had Kindness enough to offer the
fame to another Person that he would name to me, in
whom he had a great Share of Concern ? I told him, that
I could not fay I inclin'd to do so much for any one but
himself, for whom I had a particular Value, and should-
have been glad to have been the Instrument of his Deli-
verance; however, if he would please to name the Person
to me, I would give him my Answer, and hoped he would
not be displeased with me, if he was with my Answer. He
told me, it was only his Son, who, tho' I had not seen, yet
was in the fame Condition with himself and above two
hundred Miles from him, on the other Side the Oby; but
that if I consented, he would send for him.
I made no Hesitation, but told him I would do it: I
made some Ceremony in letting him understand that it wa3
wholly on his Account, and that seeing I could not prevail
on him, I would shew my Respect to him, by my Concera
for his Son; but these things are too tedious to repeat here.
He sent away the next Day for his Son, and in about 20
Days he came back with the Messenger, bringing six or se-
ven Horses, loaded with very rich Furs, and which in the
whole amounted to a very great Value.
Hia
His Servants brought the Horses into the Town, but left
the young Lord at a Distance, till Night, when-he came in-
cognito into our Apartment, and his Father presented him
to me; and in short, we concerted there the Manner of our
Travelling, and every thing proper for the Journey.
I h a d bought a considerable Quantity of Sables, black
Fox-Skins, fine Ermins, and such other Furs that are very
rich; / say, I had bought them in that City for Exchange
for some of the Goods brought from China, in particular,
for the Cloves and Nutmegs, of which I fold the greatest
Part here, and the rest afterwards at Ar h-Angel, for a much
better Price than I could have done at London; and my Part-
ner,who was sensible of the Profit, and whose Business more
particularly than mine was Merchandise, was mightily pleas'd
with our Stay, on Account of the Traflick we made here.
It was the Beginning of June, when I left this remote
Place, a City, I believe, little heard of in the-World; and
indeed it is so sar out of the Road of Commerce, that!
know not how it should be much talk'd of. We were
now come to a very small Caravan. being only thirty-two
Horses and Camels, in all, and all ot them pass'd for mine,
though my new Guest was Proprietor of eleven of them ; it
was most natural also that I should take more Servants
with me than I had before, and the young Lord pass'd for
my Steward; what great Man 1 pals'd tor myself, I know
not, Deither did it concern me to inejuire; we had here
she worst and the largest Desart to pals over that we met
with in all the Journey; indeed I call it the worst, because
the Way was very deep in some Places, and very uneven
in others; the best we had to say for it, was, that we
thought we had no Troops of Tartars and Robbers to fear,
and that they never came on this Side the River Oby, or at
least but very seldom; but we found it otherwise.
My young Lord had with him a saithful Muscovite Ser-
vant, or rather a Siberian Servant, who was perfectly ac-
quainted with the Country; and who led us by private
Roads, that we avoided coming into the principal Towns
and Cities, upon the great Road, such as Tumen, Soloy-
Katxaskoy, and several others; because the Muscovite Ga-
ri/ons which are kept there, are very curious and strict in
their Observation upon Travellers; and searching lest
any of the banish'd Persons of Note should make their
Escape that Way into Muscovy; but by this Means as we
were kept out of the Cities, so our whole Journey was a
Desart,
Dcsart, and we were oblig'd to encamp and lie in our
Tents, when we might have had very good Accommoda-
tion in the Cities on the wav: This the young Lord was
so sensible of, that he would not allow us to lie abroad,
when we came to several Cities on the way, but lay
abroad himself with his Servant in the Woods, and met
us always at the appointed Places.
W e were just enter'd Europe, having pass'd the River
Kama, which, in these Parts, is the Boundary between Eu-
rope and Asm, and the first City on the European Side was
cail'd Soloy-Kamaskoy, which is as much as to say, the great
City, on the River Kama; and here we thought to have
seen some evident Alteration in the People, their Manners,
their Habit, their Religion, and their Business; but we were
mistaken; for as we had a vast Desart to pass, which, by
Relation, is near seven hundred Miles long in some Places,
but not above two hundred Miles over where we pass'd it;
so, till we came past that horrible Place, we found very lit-
tle Difference between that Country and the Mongul Tar-
tary; the People mostly Pagans, and little better than the
Savages of America; their Houses and Towns full of Idols,
and their way of Living wholly barbarous, except in the
Cities as above, and the Villages near them; where they
are Christians, as they call them-telves, of the Greek Church;
but even these have their Religion mingled with so many
Reliques of Superstition, that it is scarce to be known in
some Places from mere Sorcery and Witchcraft.
I n passing this Forest, I thought indeed we must,- after
all our Dangers were in our Imagination escap'd, as before,
have been plunder'd and robb'd, and perhaps murder'd by
a Troop of Thieves; of what Country they were, whether
the roving Bands of the Ostiachi,, a kind or Tartars, or wild
People on the Bank of the Oby, had rang'd thus sar; or
whether they were the Sable-Hunters of Siberia, I am yet
at a Loss to know; but they were all on Horseback, car-
ry'd Bows and Arrows, and were at first about five and
forty in Number; they came so near to us, as within about
two M'usquet-shot, and asking no Questions, they surround-
ed us with their Horse, and look'd very earnestly upon us
twice; at length they plac'd themselves just in our Way,
upon which, we drew up in a little Line before our Camels,
being not above sixteen Men in all; and being drawn up
thus, we halted and sent out the Siberian Servant, who at-
tended his Lord, to see who they were; his Master was
the
the more willing to let him go, because he was not a little
apprehensive, that they were a Siberian Troop sent out af-
ter him. The Man came up near them with a Flag of Truce,
and call'd to them; but tho' he spoke several of their Lan-
guages, or Dialects of Languages rather, he could not un-
derstand a Word they said ; however, after some Signs to
him, not to come nearer to them at his Peril; so he said he
understood them to mean, offering to shoot at him if he
advane'd; the Fellow came back no wiler than he went,
only that by their Dress, he said, he believ'd them to be some
Tartars ot Kalmuck, or of the Circassian Hoords; and that
there must be more of them on the great Desart, tho' he never
heard that ever any of them were seen so sar North before.
This was small Comfort to us; however, we had no
Remedy; there was on our left Hand, at about a Quarter
of a Mile's Distance, a little Grove or Clump of Trees, which
stood close together, and very near the Road; I immedi-
ately resolv'd we would advance to those Trees, and fortify
ourselves as well as we could there; for first I consider'd,
that the Trees would in great Measure cover us from their
Arrows, and in the next Place, they could not come tacharge
us in a Body i it was indeed my old Portuguese Pilot who pro-
posed it ; and who had this Excellency attending him, namely,
that he was always readiest and most apt to direct and encou-
rage us, in Cases of the most Danger; we advane'd immedi-
ately with what Speed we could, and gain'd that little Wood,
the Tartars or Thieves, for we knew not what to call 'em,
keeping their Stand, and not attempting to hinder us. Wlien
we came thither, we found, to our great Satissaction, that
it was a swampy springy Piece of Ground, and on the one
Side, a very great Spring of Water, which running out in a
little Rill or Brook, was a little sarther join'd by another of
the like Bigness, and was in short, the Head or Source of a
considerable River, call'd afterwards ibcWirtskn; the Trees
which grew about this Spring, were not in all above two
hundred, but were very large, and stood pretty thick; so
that as soon as we got in, we saw ourselves. perfectly safe from
the Enemy, unless they alighted and attack'd us on Foot.
Sut to make this more difficult, our Sertuguese, with in-
defatigable Application, cut down great Arms of the Trees,
and laid them hanging, not cut cptite off, from one Tree to.
another, so that he mode a continued Fence almost round us.
W e staid here waiting the Motion of the Enemy some
Hours, without perceiving they made any. Offer to stir;
when;
5
when about two Hours before Night, they came down
directly upon us, and tho' we had not perceiv'd it, we found
they had been join'd by some more of the same, so that they
were near fourscore Horse, whereof, however, we sansy'd
some were Women: They came on till they were within
half Shot of our little Wood, when we fired one Musquet
without Ball, and call'd to them in the Ruffian Tongue, to
know what they wanted, and bid them keep ofF; but, as
if they knew nothing of what we said, they came on with
a double Fury directly up to the Wood-Side, not imagining
we were so barricado'd that they could not break in; our
old Pilot was our Captain, as well as he had been our En-
gineer; and desir'd of us, not to fire upon them till they
came within Pistol-Shot, and that we might be sure to kill;
and that when we did fire, we should be sure to take good
Aim. We bad him give the Word of Command; which
he delay'd so long, that they were some of them within
two Pikes Length of us when we fired.
W e aim'd so true, (or Providence directed our Shot so
sore) that we kill'd fourteen of them at the first Volley,
and wounded several others, as also several of their Horses;
for we had all of us loaded our Pieces with two or three;; <
Bullets apiece, at least.
They were terribly sorpriz'd with our Fire, and re-
treated immediately about one hundred Rods from us; in
which Time we loaded our Pieces again, and seeing them
keep that Distance, we sally'd out, and catch'd four or five
of their Horses, whoseRiders, we suppos'd were kill'd, and
coming up to the Dead, we could easily perceive they were
Tartars, but knew not from what Country, or how they
came to make an Excursion such an unusual Length.
About an Hour after they made a Motion to attack u$
again, and rode round pur little Wood, to see where else
they might break in; but finding u§ always ready to face
them, they went off again, and we resolv'd not to stir
from the Place for that Night.
W e slept little you may be sure, but spent the most Part
of the Night in strengthening our Situation, and barricado-
ing the Entrances into the Wood; and keeping a strict;
W.itch, we waited for Day-Light, and when it came, it
gave us a very unwelcome Discovery indeed; for the Ene-
my, who we thought were discourag'd with the Reception
they had met with, were now increas'd to no less than three
hundred
hundred, and had set up eleven or twelve Huts and Tentsi
as if they were resolv'd to besiege us; and this little Carap
they had pitch'd, was upon the open Plain, at about three
Quarters of a Mile from us. We were indeed surpriz'd at
this Discovery; and now I confess, I gave myself over for
lost, and all that I iad: TheLoss of my Effects did not lie
so near me, (though they were very considerable ) as the
Thoughts of falling into the Hands of such Barbarians, at
the latter End of my Journey, after so many Difficulties
and Hazards as I had gone thro'; and even in Sight of our
Port, where we expected Safety and Deliverance. As for
my Partner, he was raging, he declar'd, that to lose his
Goods would be his Ruin; and he would rather die than
be starv'd ; and he was tor fighting to the last Drop.
The young Lord, as gallant as ever Flesh shew'd itself,
was for fighting to the last also i and my old Pilot was of
the Opinion we were able to resist them all, in the Situation
we then were in; and thus we spent the Day in Debates
of what we should do; but towards Evening, we found
that the Number of our Enemies still increas'd, perhaps
as they were abroad in several Parties for Prey; the first
had sent out Scouts to call for Help, and to acauakit them
of the Booty, and we did not know, but by the Morning
they might still be a greater Number; so I began to inquire
of those People we had brought from Tobolshi, if there was
no other, or more private Ways by which we might avoid
them in the Night, and perhaps either retreat to some
Town, or get Help to guard us over the Defart.
The Siberian, who was Servant ta the young Lord,
told us, if we design'd to avoid them and not fight, he
would engage to carry us off in the Night to a Way that
went North towards the River tetraz., by which he made
no question, but we might get away, and the Tartars ne-
ver the wiser; but he faid, his Lord had told him, he
would not return, but would rather chuse to fight. I told
him, he mistook his Lord, for that he was too wise a Man
to love fighting for the Sake of it; that I knew his Lord
was brave enough by what he had shew'd already; but
that his Lord knew better, than to desire to have seven-
teen or eighteen Men fight five hundred, unless an una-
voidable Necessity fore'd them to it; and that if he
thought it possible for us to escape in the Night, we had
nothing else to do but to attempt it. He answer'd, If his
"Lord gave him such Orders, he would lose his Life if he
did not perform it; we soon brought his Lord to give that
Order, tho' privately, and we immediately prepar'd for the
putting it in Practice.
And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled
a Fire in our little Camp, which we kept burning, and
prepar'd so as to make it burn all Night, that the Tartars
might conclude we were still there; but as soon as it was
dark, (that is to fay) so as we could see the Stars (for our
Gu.de would not stir before) having all our Horses and
Cairels ready loaden, we follow'd our new Guide, who,
I soon found, steer'd himself by the Pole, or North Star,
all the Country being level for a long Way.
After we had travell'd two Hours very hard, it begin
to be lighter still, not that it was quite dark all Night, but
she Moon began to rife, so that, in short, it was rather light-
er than we wifli'd it to be; but by sixo'Clock next Morn-
ing we were gotten nrar forty Miles, tho' the Truth is,
we almost spoil'd our Horses:- Here we found a Kujstan
Village named Klrmazinshoy, where we rested, and heard
nothmg of the Calmuck Tartars that Day ; about two Hours
before Night we set out again, and travell'd till eight the
next Morning, tho' not quite so hastily as before, and about
seven o'Clock we pass'd a little River call'd Kirtz.a,
came to a good large Town inhabited by Ruffians and very
populous, call'd Ozomoys, there we heard that several Troops
of Hoords of Calmucks had been abroad upon the Desert,
but that we were now completely out of Danger of them,
which was to our great Satisfaction you may be sore. Here
we were obliged to get some fresh Horses, and having need
enough of Rest, we staid five Days; and my Partner and
1 agreed to give the honest Siberian who brought us thi-
ther, the Value of ten Pistoles, for his conducting us.
I n five Days more we came to VeuJUma, upon the River
Witz.ogda, which running into the Vwina, we were there
very happily near the End of our Travels by Land, that
River being navigable, in seven Days Passage to Arch-
Angel: From hence we came to Lawrenskcy, where the
River joins, the 3d of July, and provided ourselves with two
Luggage-Boats, and a Barge for Our Convenience;-we em-
bark'd the 7th, and arriv'd all fate it Arch-Angel the 18th,
having been a Year, five Months, and three Days on the
Journey, including our Stay ot eight Months and odd Days
at Tobolski. W t
- .
W e were oblig'd to stay at this Place six Weeks for the
Arrival of the Ships, and must have tarry'd longer had not
a Hamburgher come in above a Month looner than any of
the English Ships; when after some Consideration, that the
City of Hamburgh might happen to be as good a Market
for our Goods as London, we all took Freight with him,
and having put our Goods on board, it was most natural
tor me to put my Steward on board to take care of them,
by which means my young Lord had a sufficient Oppor-
tunity to conceal himself, never coming on Shore again in
all the Time we staid there; and this he did, that he might
not be seen in the City, where some of the Moscow Mer-
chants would certainly have seen and discovers him.
W e siil'd from Arch-Angel the loth of August the fame
Year, and after no extraordinary bad Voyage, arriv'd in
the Elbe, the i3th of September: Here my Partner and I
found a very good Sale for our Goods, as well those of
China, as the Sables, eye. of Siberia; and dividing the Pro-
duce of our Effects, my Share amounted to 3475^ 17s. $d.
notwithstanding so many Losses we had sustain'd and Char-
ges we had been at; only remembring that 1 had included,
in this, about six hundred Pounds-worth of Diamonds,
which I had purchas'd at Bengal..
Here the young Lord took his Jeave of us, and went
up the Elbe, in order to go to the Court of Vienna, where
he resolv'd to seek Protection, and where he could cor-
respond with those of his Father's Friends, who were left
alive: He did not part without all the Testimonies he could
give me, of Gratitude for the Service I had done him, and
his Sense of my Kindness to the Prince his Father.
To conclude, having staid near four Months in Ham-
burgh, I came from thence over Land to the Hague, where
I embark'd in the Pacquet, and arriv'd m London, the 10th
of January, 170s. having been gone from England ten
Years and nine Months.
And here, resolving to harrass myself no more, I am
preparing for a longer.Journey than all these, having liv'd
72 Years, a Life ot infinite Variety, and lcarn'd sufficiently
to know the Value of Retirement, ana the Blessmg of
our Days in Peace." . .
