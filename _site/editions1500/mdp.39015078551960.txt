WAS born in the year 1632, in
the city of York, of a good
family, though not of that
country, my father being a
foreigner of Bremen, who
settled first at Hull. He got a good
estate by merchandise, and leaving
off his trade, lived afterward at York,
from whence he had married my
mother, whose relations were named Robinson,
a very good family in that country, and from
whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but
by the usual corruption of words in England we
are now called, nay, we call ourselves, and write
our name, Crusoe, and so my companions always called me.
2 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE
Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade,
my head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts.
My father, who was very ancient, had given me a competent
share of learning, as far as house-education and a country free
school generally goes, and designed me for the law; but I would
be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and my inclination
to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the commands,
of my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of
my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something
fatal in that propension of nature tending directly to the life of
misery which was to befall me.
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and
excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He
called me one morning into his chamber, where he was confined
by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon this
subject.
He pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate
manner, not to play the young man, not to precipitate myself
into miseries which Nature and the station of life I was born in
seemed to have provided against; that I was under no neces-
sity of seeking my bread; that he would do well for me, and
endeavour to enter me fairly into the middle station of life
which he had been just recommending to me; and that if I
was not very easy and happy in the world it must be my
mere fate or fault that must hinder it, and that he should
have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his
duty in warning me against measures which he knew would
be to my hurt; in a word, that as he would do very kind
things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he
directed, so he would not have so much hand in my mis-
fortunes, as to give me any encouragement to go away.
And to close all, he told me I had my elder brother for an
example, to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions
to keep him from going into the Low Country wars, but
could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run
into the army, where he was killed; and though he said he
would not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say
to me, that if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless
me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having
neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my
recovery.
I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as indeed who
could be otherwise? and I resolved not to think of going
abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my father's
desire. But alas! a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to
prevent any of my father's farther importunities, in a few weeks
after I resolved to run quite away from him. However, I did
not act so hastily neither as my first heat of resolution
prompted, but I took my mother, at a time when I thought
her a little pleasanter than ordinary, and told her, that my
thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world, that I
should never settle to anything with resolution enough to go
through with it, and my father had better give me his consent
than force me to go without it; that I was now eighteen years
old, which was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk
to an attorney; that I was sure if I did, I should never serve
out my time, and I should certainly run away from my master
before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak
to my father to let me go but one voyage abroad, if I came
home again and did not like it, I would go no more, and I
would promise by a double diligence to recover that time I
had lost.
This put my mother into a great passion. She told me,
she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon
any such subject; that he knew too well what was my interest
to give his consent to anything so much for my hurt, and that
she wondered how I could think of any such thing after such
a discourse as I had had with my father, and such kind and
tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me;
and that, in short, if I would ruin myself there was no help for
me; but I might depend I should never have their consent
to it; that for her part, she would not have so much hand in
my destruction, and I should never have it to say, that my
mother was willing when my father was not.
Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet, as
I have heard afterwards, she reported all the discourse to him,
and that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said
to her with a sigh, " That boy might be happy if he would stay
at home, but if he goes abroad he will be the miserablest wretch
that was ever born: I can give no consent to it."
It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose,
though in the meantime I continued obstinately deaf to all
proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulating
with my father and mother about their being so positively
determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted
me to. But being one day at Hull, where I went casually, and
without any purpose of making an elopement that time; but I
say, being there, and one of my companions being going by
sea to London, in his father's ship, and prompting me to go
with them, with the common allurement of seafaring men, viz.,
that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I consulted
neither father or mother any more, nor so much as sent them
word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, with-
out asking God's blessing, or my father's, without any con-
sideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour,
God knows, on the first of September, 1651, I went on board
a ship bound for London. Never any young adventurer's
misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued longer than
mine. The ship was no sooner gotten out of the Humber, but
the wind began to blow, and the waves to rise in a most frightful
manner; and as I had never been at sea before, I was most in-
expressibly sick in body, and terrified in my mind. I began
now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly
I was overtaken by the judgment of heaven for my wicked
leaving my father's house, and abandoning my duty.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea, which I had
never been upon before, went very high, though nothing like
what I have seen many times since; no, nor like what I saw a few
days after. But it was enough to affect me then, who was but
a young sailor, and had never known anything of the matter.
I expected every wave would have swallowed us up, and that
every time the ship fell down, as I thought, in the trough or
hollow of the sea, we should never rise more; and in this agony
of mind I made many vows and resolutions, that if it would
please God here to spare my life this one voyage, if ever I got
once my foot upon dry land again, I would go directly home to
my father, and never set it into a ship again while I lived; that
I would take his advice, and never run myself into such miseries
as these any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of his
observations about the middle station of life, how easy, how
comfortably he had lived all his days, and never had been
exposed to tempests at sea, or troubles on shore; and I resolved
that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my father.
These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the
storm continued, and indeed some time after; but the next
day the wind was abated and the sea calmer, and I began to be
a little inured to it. However, I was very grave for all that
day, being also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming
fine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly clear, and
rose so the next morning; and having little or no wind, and a
smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought,
the most delightful that ever I saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick
but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was
so rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and
so pleasant in so little time after. And now lest my good
resolutions should continue, my companion, who had indeed
enticed me away, comes to me: "Well, Bob," says he, clapping
me on the shoulder, "how do you do after it? I warrant
you were frighted, wa'n't you, last night, when it blew but a
capful of wind?" "A capful, d'you call it?" said I; "'twas
a terrible storm." "A storm, you fool you," replies he; "do
you call that a storm? Why, it was nothing at all; give us
but a good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing of such
a squall of wind as that; but you're but a fresh-water sailor,
Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget
all that; d'ye see what charming weather 'tis now?" To
make short this sad part of my story, we went the old way
of all sailors; the punch was made, and I was made drunk
with it, and in that one night's wickedness I drowned all
my repentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, and
all my resolutions for my future. I found indeed some
intervals of reflection, and the serious thoughts did, as it
were, endeavour to return again sometimes; but I shook them
off, and roused myself from them as it were from a distemper,
and applying myself to drink and company, soon mastered the
return of those fits, for so I called them, and I had in five or six
days got as complete a victory over conscience as any young
fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could desire.
But I was to have another trial for it still; and Providence, as
in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely
without excuse. For if I would not take this for a deliverance,
the next was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened
wretch among us would confess both the danger and the mercy.
The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth
roads; the wind having been contrary and the weather calm,
we had made but little way since the storm. Here we were
obliged to come to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind con-
tinuing contrary, viz., at south-west, for seven or eight days,
during which time a great many ships from Newcastle came
into the same roads, as the common harbour where the ships
might wait for a wind for the river.
We had not, however, rid here so long, but should have tided
it up the river, but that the wind blew too fresh; and after we
had lain four or five days, blew very hard. However, the roads
being reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and
our ground-tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and
not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent the time in
rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but the eighth day
in the morning the wind increased, and we had all hands at
work to strike our topmasts, and make everything snug and
close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the
sea went very high indeed, and our ship rid forecastle in,
shipped several seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor
had come home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet-
anchor, so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables
veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed, and now I
began to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the
seamen themselves. The master, though vigilant to the business
of preserving the ship, yet as he went in and out of his cabin by
me, I could hear him softly to himself say several times, " Lord
be merciful to us, we shall be all lost, we shall be all undone";
and the like. During these first hurries I was stupid, lying still
in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot describe my
temper; I could ill reassume the first penitence, which I had so
apparently trampled upon, and hardened myself against; I
thought the bitterness of death had been past, and that this
would be nothing too, like the first. But when the master him-
self came by me, as I said just now, and said we should be all
lost, I was dreadfully frighted; I got up out of my cabin, and
looked out. But such a dismal sight I never saw; the sea went
mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four minutes;
when I could look about, I could see nothing but distress round
us. Two ships that rid near us we found had cut their masts by
the board, being deep loaden; and our men cried out, that a
ship which rid about a mile ahead of us was foundered. Two
more ships being driven from their anchors, were run out of the
roads to sea at all adventures, and that with not a mast stand-
ing. The light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring
in the sea; but two or three of them drove, and came close by
us, running away with only their sprit-sail out before the wind.
Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the
master of our ship to let them cut away the foremast, which he
was very unwilling to. But the boatswain protesting to him
that if he did not the ship would founder, he consented; and
when they had cut away the foremast, the mainmast stood so
loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut her
away also, and make a clear deck.
Any one may judge what a condition I must be in
at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been
in such a fright before at but a little. But if I can express
at this distance the thoughts I had about me at that time, I
was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my
former convictions, and the having returned from them to
the resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at
death itself; and these, added to the terror of the storm,
put me into such a condition, that I can by no words describe
it. But the worst was not come yet; the storm continued
with such fury, that the seamen themselves acknowledged
they had never known a worse. We had a good ship, but
she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the sea, that the sea-
men every now and then cried out she would founder. It

ALL HANDS WERE CALLED TO THE PUMPS.
was my advantage in one respect, that I did not know what
they meant by founder till I inquired. However, the storm
was so violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the master,
the boatswain, and some others more sensible than the rest,
at their prayers, and expecting every moment when the ship
would go to the bottom. In the middle of the night, and
under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men that had
been down on purpose to see cried out we had sprung a leak;
another said there was four foot water in the hold. Then all
hands were called to the pump. At that very word my
heart, as I thought, died within me, and I fell backwards
upon the side of my bed where I sat, into the cabin. How-
ever, the men roused me, and told me, that I, that was able to
do nothing before, was as well able to pump as another; at
which I stirred up and went to the pump and worked very
heartily. While this was doing, the master seeing some light
colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm, were obliged to slip
and run away to sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a
gun as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what that,
meant, was so surprised that I thought the ship had broke, or
some dreadful thing had happened. In a word, I was so
surprised that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time
when everybody had his own life to think of, nobody minded
me, or what was become of me; but another man stepped up
to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie,
thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before I
came to myself.
We worked on, but the water increasing in the hold, it was
apparent that the ship would founder, and though the storm
began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible she could swim
till we might run into a port, so the master continued firing
guns for help; and a light ship, who had rid it out just ahead
of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the utmost
hazard the boat came near us, but it was impossible for us to
get on board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side, till at
last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to
save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy
to it, and then veered it out a great length, which they after
great labour and hazard took hold of, and we hauled them
close under our stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no
purpose for them or us after we were in the boat to think of
reaching to their own ship, so all agreed to let her drive, and
only to pull her in towards shore as much as we could, and our
master promised them that if the boat was staved upon shore
he would make it good to their master; so partly rowing and
partly driving, our boat went away to the norward, sloping
towards the shore almost as far as Winterton Ness.
While we were in this condition, the men yet labouring
at the oar to bring the boat near the shore, we could see,
when, our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see the
shore, a great many people running along the shore to assist
us when we should come near. But we made but slow way
towards the shore, nor were we able to reach the shore, till
being past the lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls off to
the westward towards Cromer, and so the land broke off a little
the violence of the wind. Here we got in, and though not
without much difficulty got all safe on shore, and walked
afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men,
we were used with great humanity as well by the magistrates
of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by particular
merchants and owners of ships, and had money given us
sufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as we
thought fit.
Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and
have gone home, I had been happy, and my father, an emblem
of our blessed Saviour's parable, had even killed the fatted calf
for me; for hearing the ship I went away in was cast away
in Yarmouth road, it was a great while before he had any
assurance that I was not drowned.
But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that
nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud
calls from my reason and my more composed judgment to go
home, yet I had no power to do it. I know not what to call
this, nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling decree that
hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction,
even though it be before us, and that we rush upon it with our
eyes open. Certainly nothing but some such decreed unavoid-
able misery attending, and which it was impossible for me to
escape, could have pushed me forward against the calm
reasonings and persuasions of my most retired thoughts, and
against two such visible instructions as I had met with in my
first attempt.
My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and
who was the master's son, was now less forward than I. The
first time he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which was
not till two or three days, for we were separated in the town to
several quarters—I say, the first time he saw me, it appeared
his tone was altered, and looking very melancholy and shaking
his head, asked me how I did, and telling his father who I was,
and how I had come this voyage only for a trial in order to
go farther abroad, his father turning to me with a very grave
and concerned tone, " Young man," says he, "you ought never
to go to sea any more, you ought to take this for a plain and
visible token, that you are not to be a seafaring man. And,
young man," said he, " depend upon it, if you do not go back,
wherever you go you will meet with nothing but disasters and
disappointments, till your father's words are fulfilled upon you."
We parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I
saw him no more; which way he went, I know not. As for me,
having some money in my pocket, I travelled to London by
land; and there, as well as on the road, had many struggles
with myself what course of life I should take, and whether I
should go home, or go to sea.
As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that
offered to my thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me
how I should be laughed at among the neighbours, and should
be ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even
everybody else; from whence I have since often observed how
incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is,
especially of youth, to that reason which ought to guide them
in such cases, viz., that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are
ashamed to repent; not ashamed of the action for which they
ought justly to be esteemed fools, but are ashamed of the
returning, which only can make them be esteemed wise men.
It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in
London, which does not always happen to such loose and mis-
guided young fellows as I then was; the devil generally not
omitting to lay some snare for them very early; but it was not
so with me. I first fell acquainted with the master of a ship
who had been on the coast of Guinea, and who, having had very
good success there, was resolved to go again; and who, taking a
fancy to my conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at
that time, hearing me say I had a mind to see the world, told
me if I would go the voyage with him I should be at no
expense; I should be his messmate and his companion; and if
I could carry anything with me, I should have all the advantage
of it that the trade would admit, and perhaps I might meet with
some encouragement.
I embraced the offer; and, entering into a strict friendship
with this captain, who was an honest and plain-dealing man, I
went the voyage with him, and carried a small adventure with
me, which, by the disinterested honesty of my friend the
captain, I increased very considerably, for I carried about £40
in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy.
This £40 I had mustered together by the assistance of some of
my relations whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe, got
my father, or at least my mother, to contribute so much as that
to my first adventure.
This was the only voyage which I may say was successful in
all my adventures, and which I owe to the integrity and honesty
of my friend the captain; under whom also I got a competent
knowledge of the mathematics and the rules of navigation,
learned how to keep an account of the ship's course, take an
observation, and, in short, to understand some things that were
needful to be understood by a sailor. For, as he took delight
to introduce me, I took delight to learn; and, in a word, this
voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant; for I brought
home five pounds nine ounces of gold dust for my adventure,
which yielded me in London at my return almost .£300, and
this filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have since so
completed my ruin.
Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too;
particularly, that I was continually sick, being thrown into a
violent calenture by the excessive heat of the climate; our
principal trading being upon the coast, from the latitude of 15
degrees north even to the line itself.
I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend,to my
great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go
the same voyage again, and I embarked in the same vessel with
one who was his mate in the former voyage, and had now got
the command of the ship. This was the unhappiest voyage
that ever man made; for though I did not carry quite £100 of
my new-gained wealth, so that I had £200 left, and which I
lodged with my friend's widow, who was very just to me, yet I
fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage; and the first was
this, viz., our ship making her course towards the Canary
Islands, or rather between those islands and the African shore,
was surprised in the grey of the morning by a Turkish rover of
Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the sail she could make.
We crowded also as much canvas as our yards would spread, or
our masts carry, to have got clear; but finding the pirate gained
upon us, and would certainly come up with us in a few hours,
we prepared to fight, our ship having twelve guns, and the
rogue eighteen. About three in the afternoon he came up with
us, and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter,
instead of athwart our
stern, as he intended,
we brought eight of
our guns to bear on
that side, and poured
in a broadside upon
him, which made him
sheer off again, after
returning our fire and
pouring in also his
small-shot from near
200 men which he had
on board. However,
we had not a man
touched, all our men
keeping close. He
prepared to attack us
again, and we to de-
fend ourselves; but
laying us on board
the next time upon
our other quarter, he
entered sixty men
upon our decks, who
immediately fell to
cutting and hacking
the decks and rigging.
We plied them with
small-shot, half-pikes,
powder-chests, and
such like, and cleared
our deck of them twice. However, to cut short this melancholy
part of our story, our ship being disabled, and three of our
men killed and eight wounded, we were obliged to yield, and
were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to the
Moors.

GAVK CHASE WITH ALL THE SAIL SHE COULD SET.
The usage 1 had there was not so dreadful as at first I
apprehended, nor was I carried up the country to the emperor's
court, as the rest of our men were, but was kept by the captain
of the rover as his proper prize, and made his slave, being young
and nimble, and fit for his business.
As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his
house, so I was in hopes that he would take me with him when
he went to sea again, believing that it would some time or other
be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portugal man-of-war;
and that then I should be set at liberty. But this hope of mine
was soon taken away; for when he went to sea, he left me on
shore to look after his little garden, and do the common
drudgery of slaves about his house; and when he came home
again from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin to look
after the ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method
I might take to effect it, but found no way that had the least
probability in it. Nothing presented to make the supposition
of it rational; for I had nobody to communicate it to that
would embark with me; so that for two years, though I often
pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never had the least
encouraging prospect of putting it in practice.
After about two years an odd circumstance presented itself,
which put the old thought of making some attempt for my
liberty again in my head. My patron lying at home longer
than usual without fitting out his ship, which, as I heard, was
for want of money, he used constantly, once or twice a week,
sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the ship's
pinnace, and go out into the road a-fishing; and as he always
took me and a young Maresco with him to row the boat, we
made him very merry, and I proved very dexterous in catching
fish; insomuch, that sometimes he would send me with a Moor,
one of his kinsmen, and the youth the Maresco, as they called
him, to catch a dish offish for him.
It happened one time that, going a-fishing in a stark calm
morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we were not half a
league from the shore we lost sight of it; and rowing we knew
not whither or which way, we laboured all day, and all the next
night, and when the morning came we found we had pulled off
to sea instead of pulling in for the shore; and that we were at
least two leagues from the shore. However, we got well in
again, though with a great deal of labour, and some danger,
for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but
particularly we were all very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take
more care of himself for the future; and having lying by him
the long-boat of our English ship which he had taken, he
resolved he would not go a-fishing any more without a compass
and some provision; so he ordered the carpenter of his ship,
who also was an English slave, to build a little state-room, or
cabin, in the middle of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with
a place to stand behind it to steer and haul home the main-
sheet, and room before for a hand or two to stand and work the
sails.
We went frequently out with this boat a-fishing, and as I
was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without
me. It happened that he had appointed to go out in this boat,
either for pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors of some
distinction in that place, and for whom he had provided extra-
ordinarily; and had therefore sent on board the boat overnight
a larger store of provisions than ordinary; and had ordered me
to get ready three fuzees with powder and shot, which were on
board his ship, for that they designed some sport of fowling as
well as fishing.
I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the
next morning with the boat, washed clean, her ancient and
pendants out, and everything to accommodate his guests; when
by-and-by my patron came on board alone, and told me his
guests had put off going, upon some business that fell out, and
ordered me with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with the
boat and catch them some fish, for that his friends were to sup
at his house; and commanded that as soon as I had got some
fish I should bring it home to his house; all which I prepared
to do.
This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into
my thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a little ship at
my command; and my master being gone, I prepared to furnish
myself, not for a fishing business, but for a voyage; though I
knew not, neither did I so much as consider, whither I should
steer; for anywhere, to get out of that place, was my way.
My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this
Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board; for I told
him we must not presume to eat of our patron's bread. He
said that was true; so he brought a large basket of rusk or
biscuit of their kind, and three jars with fresh water, into the
boat. I knew where my patron's case of bottles stood, which
it was evident by the make were taken out of some English
prize; and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was
on shore, as if they had been there before for our master, I
conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat, which
weighed above half a hundredweight, with a parcel of twine or
thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which were great
use to us afterwards, especially the wax to make candles. Thus
furnished with everything needful, we sailed out of the port
to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the port,
knew who we were, and took no notice of us; and we were not
above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail, and
set us down to fish. The wind blew from the N.N.E., which
was contrary to my desire; for had it blown southerly I had
been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at least reached
to the bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow which way
it would, I would be gone from the horrid place where I was,
and leave the rest to Fate.
After we had fished some time and catched nothing, for
when I had fish on my hook I would not pull them up, that he
might not see them, I said to the Moor, "This will not do; our
master will not be thus served ; we must stand farther off." He,
thinking no harm, agreed, and being in the head of the boat set
the sails; and as I had the helm I run the boat out near a
league farther, and then brought her to as if I would fish ; when
giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor
was, and making as if I stooped for something behind him, I
took him by surprise with my arm under his twist, and tossed
him clear overboard into the sea. He rose immediately, for he
swam like a cork, and called to me, begged to be taken in, told
me he would go all the world over with me. He swam so strong
after the boat, that he would have reached me very quickly,
"1
I
I

"IF YOU COME NEAR THE BOAT I'LL SHOOT YOU'"
there being but little wind ; upon which I stepped into the cabin,
and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I presented it at him,
and told him I had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet
I would do him none. "But," said I," you swim well enough to
reach to the shore, and the sea is calm; make the best of your
way to shore, and I will do you no harm ; but if you come near
the boat I'll shoot you through the head, for I am resolved to
have my liberty." So he turned himself about, and swam for
the shore, and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for
he was an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me,
and have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust
him. When he was gone I turned to the boy, whom they called
Xury, and said to him, "Xury, if you will be faithful to me I'll
make you a great man; but if you will not stroke your face to
be true to me," that is, swear by Mahomet and his father's beard,
"I must throw you into the sea too." The boy smiled in my
face, and spoke so innocently, that I could not mistrust him,
and swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the world with
me.
While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I
stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to
windward, that they might think me gone towards the straits'
mouth.
But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my
course, and steered directly south and by east, bending my
course a little toward the east, that I might keep in with the
shore; and having a fair, fresh gale of wind, and a smooth,
quiet sea, I made such sail that I believe by the next day at
three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the land, I
could not be less than 150 miles south of Sallee ; quite beyond
the Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any other
king thereabouts, for we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and the
dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that I
would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an anchor, the wind
continuing fair, till I had sailed in that manner five days; and
then the wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also that
if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also would now
B
give over; so I ventured to make to the coast, and came to an
anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew not what, or where;
neither what latitude, what country, what nations, or what
river. I neither saw, or desired to see, any people; the principal
thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek in
the evening, resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark,
and discover the country; but as soon as it was quite dark we
heard such dreadful noises of the barking, roaring, and howling
of wild creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that the poor boy
was ready to die with fear, and begged of me not to go on
shore till day.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but
we were both more frighted when we heard one of these mighty
creatures come swimming towards our boat; we could not see
him, but we might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous
huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a lion, and it might
be so for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to me to weigh
the anchor and row away. "No," says I, "Xury; we can slip
our cable with the buoy to it, and go off to sea; they cannot
follow us far." I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the
creature (whatever it was) within two oars' length, which some-
thing surprised me; however, I immediately stepped to the
cabin door, and taking up my gun, fired at him, upon which he
immediately turned about and swam towards the shore again.
But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, and
hideous cries and howl ings, that were raised, as well upon the
edge of the shore as higher within the country, upon the noise
or report of the gun, a thing I have some reason to believe
those creatures had never heard before. This convinced me
that there was no going on shore for us in the night upon that
coast; and how to venture on shore in the day was another
question too; for to have fallen into the hands of any of the
savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into the hands of
lions and tigers; at least we were equally apprehensive of the
danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore some-
where or other for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat;
when or where to get to it, was the point. Xury said if I would
let him go on shore with one of the jars, he would find if there
was any water and bring some to me. I asked him why he
would go? why I should not go and he stay in the boat? The
boy answered with so much affection, that made me love him
ever after. Says he, "If wild mans come, they eat me, you go
way." "Well, Xury," said I, " we will both go; and if the wild
mans come, we will kill them, they shall eat neither of us." So
I gave Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat, and a dram out of our
patron's case of bottles which I mentioned before; and we
hauled in the boat as near the shore as we thought was proper,
and so waded on shore, carrying nothing but our arms and two
jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the
coming of canoes with savages down the river ; but the boy see-
ing a low place about a mile up the country, rambled to it; and
by-and-by I saw him come running towards me. I thought he
was pursued by some savage, or frighted with some wild beast,
and I ran forward towards him to help him; but when I came
nearer to him, I saw something hanging over his shoulders, which
was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but different in
colour, and longer legs. However, we were very glad of it, and
it was very good meat; but the great joy that poor Xury came
with was to tell me he had found good water, and seen no wild
mans.
As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very
well that the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verde
Islands also, lay not far off from the coast. But as I had no
instruments to take an observation to know what latitude we
were in, and did not exactly know, or at least remember, what
latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for them, or
when to stand off to sea towards them; otherwise I might now
easily have found some of these islands. But my hope was,
that if I stood along this coast till I came to that part where
the English traded, I should find some of their vessels upon
their usual design of trade, that would relieve and take us in.
Once or twice in the daytime I thought I saw the Pico of
Teneriffe, being the high top of the Mountain Teneriffe in the
Canaries, and had a great mind to venture out, in hopes of
reaching thither; but having tried twice, I was forced in again
by contrary winds, the sea also going too high for my little
,<r^:f i'-'^-*^'*-- '-'-'-- '"~*l ^,g^^*"

H« STARTED UP GROWLING.
vessel; so I resolved to pursue my first design, and keep along
the shore.
Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water after we
had left this place; and once in particular, being early in the
morning, we came to an anchor under a little point of land which
was pretty high; and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to
go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about him than it
seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells me that we had
best go farther off the shore; "For," says he, " look, yonder lies
a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock fast asleep." I
looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed,
for it was a terrible great lion that lay on the side of the shore,
under the shade of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a little
over him. "Xury," says I, "you shall go on shore and kill him."
Xury looked frighted, and said, "Me kill! he eat me at one
mouth"; one mouthful he meant. However, I said no more
to the boy, but bade him lie still, and I took our biggest gun,
which was almost musket-bore, and loaded it with a good charge
of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it down ; then I loaded
another gun with two bullets; and the third (for we had three
pieces) I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best aim
I could with the first piece to have shot him into the head, but
he lay so with his leg raised a little above his nose, that the slugs
hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bone. He started up
growling at first, but finding his leg broke, fell down again, and
then got up upon three legs and gave the most hideous roar
that ever I heard. I was a little surprised that I had not hit
him on the head. However, I took up the second piece
immediately, and, though he began to move off, fired again, and
shot him into the head, and had the pleasure to see him drop,
and make but little noise, but lay struggling for life. Then
Xury took heart, and would have me let him go on shore. "Well,
go," said I; so the boy jumped into the water, and taking a
little gun in one hand, swam to shore with the other hand, and
coming close to the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his
ear, and shot him into the head again, which despatched him
quite.
This was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I was
very sorry to loose three charges of powder and shot upon a
creature that was good for nothing to us. However, Xury said
he would have seme of him; so he comes on board, and asked
me to give him the hatchet. "For what, Xury?" said I. "Me
cut off his head," said he. However, Xury could not cut off his
head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was
a monstrous great one.
I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin of him
might one way or other be of some value to us; and I resolved
to take off his skin if I could. So Xury and I went to work
with him; but Xury was much the better workman at it, for I
knew very ill how to do it. Indeed, it took us up both the
whole day, but at last we got off the hide of him, and spreading
it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two
days' time, and it afterwards served me to lie upon.
After this stop we made on to the southward continually for
ten or twelve days, living very sparing on our provisions, which
began to abate very much, and going no oftener into the shore
than we were obliged to for fresh water. My design in this was
to make the river Gambia or Senegal—that is to say, anywhere
about the Cape de Verde—where I was in hopes to meet with
some European ship; and if I did not, I knew not what course
I had to take, but to seek out for the islands, or perish there
among the negroes. I knew that all the ships from Europe,
which sailed either to the coast of Guinea or to Brazil, or to the
East Indies, made this cape, or those islands; and in a word, I
put the whole of my fortune upon this single point, either that I
must meet with some ship, or must perish.
When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer,
as I have said, I began to see that the land was inhabited; and
in two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand
upon the shore to look at us; we could also perceive they were
quite black, and stark naked. I was once inclined to have gone
on shore to them; but Xury was my better counsellor, and said
to me, " No go, no go." However, I hauled in nearer the shore
that I might talk to them, and I found they ran along the shore
by me a good way. I observed they had no weapons in their
hands, except one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury
said was a lance, and that they would throw them a great way
with good aim. So I kept at a distance, but talked with them by
signs as well as I could, and particularly made signs for some-
thing to eat; they beckoned to me to stop my boat, and that
they would fetch me some meat. Upon this I lowered the top
of my sail, and layby, and two of them ran up into the country,
and in less than half an hour came back, and brought with them
two pieces of dried flesh and some corn, such as is the produce
of their country; but we neither knew what the one or the other
was. However, we were willing to accept it, but how to come
at it was our next dispute, for I was not for venturing on shore
to them, and they were as much afraid of us; but they took a
safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore and laid it
down, and went and stood a great way off till we fetched it on
board, and then came close to us again.
I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and
water; and leaving my friendly negroes, I made forward for
about eleven days more, without offering to go near the shore,
till I saw the land run out a great length into the sea, at about
the distance of four or five leagues before me; and the sea being
very calm, I kept a large offing, to make this point. At length,
doubling the point, at about two leagues from the land, I saw
plainly land on the other side, to seaward; then I concluded, as
it was most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de Verde,
and those the islands, called from thence Cape de Verde Islands.
However, they were at a great distance, and I could not well tell
what I had best to do; for if I should be taken with a fresh of
wind, I might neither reach one or other.
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the
cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the helm; when, on a
sudden, the boy cried out, "Master, master, a ship with a sail!"
and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits, thinking it must
needs be some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when I
knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach. I jumped
out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only the ship, but
what she was, viz., that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought,
was bound to the coast of Guinea, for negroes. But when I
observed the course she steered, I was soon convinced they were
bound some other way, and did not design to come any nearer
to the shore; upon which I stretched out to sea as much as I
could, resolving to speak with them, if possible.
With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able
to come in their way, but that they would be gone by before I
could make any signal to them; but after I had crowded to the
utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems, saw me by the help
of their perspective glasses, and that it was some European boat
which, as they supposed, must belong to some ship that was lost
so they shortened sail to let me come up. I was encouraged
with this; and as I had my patron's ancient on board, I made
a waft of it to them for a signal of distress, and fired a gun, both
which they saw; for they told me they saw the smoke, though
they did not hear the gun. Upon these signals they were
kindly brought to, and lay by for me; and in about three hours'
time I came up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish,
and in French, but I understood none of them; but at last a
Scots sailor, who was on board, called to me, and I answered
him, and told him I was an Englishman, that I had made my
escape out of slavery from the Moors, at Sallee. Then they
bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and all
my goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one will believe,
that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miser-
able, and almost hopeless, condition as I was in; and I
immediately offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a
return for my deliverance. But he generously told me he
would take nothing from me, but that all I had should be
delivered safe to me when I came to the Brazils. "For," says
he, " I have saved your life on no other terms than I would be
glad to be saved myself; and it may, one time or other, be my
lot to be taken up in the same condition. Besides," says he,
"when I carry you to the Brazils, so great a way from your
own country, if I should take from you what you have, you will
be starved there, and then I only take away that life I have given.
No, no, Seignior Inglese," says he, "Mr. Englishman, I will
carry you thither in charity, and those things will help you
to buy your subsistence there, and your passage home
again."
As he was charitable in his proposal, so he was just in the
performance to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen that none
should offer to touch anything I had; then he took everything
into his own possession, and gave me back an exact inventory
of them, that I might have them, even so much as my three
earthen jars.
As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he saw,
and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's use, and asked
me what I would have for it? I told him he had been so
generous to me in everything, that I could not offer to make
any price of the boat, but left it entirely to him; upon which
he told me he would give me a note of his hand to pay me
eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil, and when it came there,
if any one offered to give more, he would make it up. He
offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy Xury,
which I was loth to take; not that I was not willing to let the
captain have him, but I was very loth to sell the poor boy's
liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own.
However, when I let him know my reason, he owned it to be
just, and offered me this medium, that he would give the boy
an obligation to set him free in ten years if he turned Christian.
Upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let
the captain have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in
the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, in about
twenty-two days after. And now I was once more delivered
from the most miserable of all conditions of life; and what to
do next with myself, I was now to consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never
enough remember. He would take nothing of me for my
passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's skin, and
forty for the lion's skin, which I had in my boat, and caused
everything I had in the ship to be punctually delivered me;
and what I was willing to sell he bought, such as the case of
bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of beeswax—
for I had made candles of the rest; in a word, I made about
220 pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with this stock I went
on shore in the Brazils.
I had not been long here, but being recommended to the
house of a good honest man like himself, who had an ingeino as
they call it, that is, a plantation and a sugar-house, I lived with
him some time, and acquainted myself by that means with the
manner of their planting and making of sugar; and seeing how
well the planters lived, and how they grew rich suddenly, I
resolved, if I could get licence to settle there, I would turn
planter among them, resolving in the meantime to find out
some way to get my money which I had left in London
remitted to me. To this purpose, getting a kind of a letter of
naturalisation, I purchased as much land that was uncured as
my money would reach, and formed a plan for my plantation
and settlement, and such a one as might be suitable to the stock
which I proposed to myself to receive from England.
I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born of
English parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such
circumstances as I was. I call him my neighbour, because his
plantation lay next to mine, and we went on very sociably
together. My stock was but low, as well as his; and we rather
planted for food than anything else, for about two years.
However, we began to increase, and our land began to come
into order; so that the third year we planted some tobacco,
and made each of us a large piece of ground ready for planting
canes in the year to come. But we both wanted help; and
now I found, more than before, I had done wrong in parting
with my boy Xury.
I was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying
on the plantation before my kind friend, the captain of the ship
that took me up at sea, went back; for the ship remained there
in providing his loading, and preparing for his voyage, near
three months; when, telling him what little stock I had left
behind me in London, he gave me this friendly and sincere
advice: "Seignior Inglese," says he, for so he always called me,
"if you will give me letters, and a procuration here in form to
me, with orders to the person who has your money in London
to send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct,
and in such goods as are proper for this country, I will bring
you the produce of them, God willing, at my return. But since
human affairs are all subject to changes and disasters, I would
have you give orders but for one hundred pounds sterling,
which, you say, is half your stock, and let the hazard be run for
the first; so that if it come safe, you may order the rest the
same way; and if it miscarry, you may have the other half to
have recourse to for your supply."
This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that
I could not but be convinced it was the best course I could
take; so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman
with whom I had left my money, and a procuration to the
Portuguese captain, as he desired.
I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all
my adventures; my slavery, escape, and how I had met with
the Portugal captain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and
in what condition I was now in, with all other necessary
directions for my supply. And when this honest captain came
to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English merchants
there, to send over not the order only, but a full account of my
story to a merchant at London, who represented it effectually
to her; whereupon, she not only delivered the money, but out
of her own pocket sent the Portugal captain a very handsome
present for his humanity and charity to me.
The merchant in London vesting this hundred pounds in
English goods, such as the captain had writ for, sent them
directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe tome
to the Brazils; among which, without my direction (for I was
too young in my business to think of them), he had taken care
to have all sorts of tools, iron-work, and utensils necessary for
my plantation, and which were of great use to me.
When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune made, for I
was surprised with joy of it; and my good steward, the captain,
had laid out the five pounds, which my friend had sent him for
a present for himself, to purchase and bring me over a servant
under bond for six years' service, and would not accept of any
consideration, except a little tobacco, which I would have him
accept, being of my own produce.
Neither was this all; but my goods being all English
manufactures, such as cloth, stuffs, baize, and things particularly
valuable and desirable in the country, I found means to sell
them to a very great advantage; so that I may say I had more
than four times the value of my first cargo, and was now
infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the advance-
ment of my plantation; for the first thing I did, I bought me
a negro slave, and an European servant also; I mean another
besides that which the captain brought me from Lisbon.
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means
of our greatest adversity, so was it with me. I went on the
next year with great success in my plantation. I raised fifty
great rolls of tobacco on my own ground, more than I had
disposed of for necessaries among my neighbours; and these
fifty rolls, being each of above a hundredweight, were well
cured, and laid by against the return of the fleet from Lisbon.
And now, increasing in business and in wealth, my head began
to be full of projects and undertakings beyond my reach, such
as are, indeed, often the ruin of the best heads in business.
You may suppose, that having now lived almost four years
in the Brazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well
upon my plantation, I had not only learned the language, but
had contracted acquaintance and friendship among my fellow-
planters, as well as among the merchants at St Salvador, which
was our port, and that in my discourses among them I had
frequently given them an account of my two voyages to the
coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the negroes there,
and how easy it was to purchase upon the coast for trifles—
such as beads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and
the like—not only gold-dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth,
&c., but negroes, for the service of the Brazils, in great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my discourses on
these heads, but especially to that part which related to the
buying negroes; which was a trade, at that time, not only not
far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been carried on by
the assiento, or permission, of the Kings of Spain and Portugal,
so that few negroes were brought, and those excessive dear.
It happened, being in company with some merchants and
planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those things very
earnestly, three of them came to me the next morning, and
told me they had been musing very much upon what I had
discoursed with them of, the last night, and they came to make
a secret proposal to me. And after enjoining me secrecy, they
told me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea;
that they had all plantations as well as I, and were straitened
for nothing so much as servants; that as it was a trade that
could not be carried on because they could not publicly sell
the negroes when they came home, so they desired to make
but one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore privately, and
divide them among their own plantations; and, in a word, the
question was, whether I would go their supercargo in the ship,
to manage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and they
offered me that I should have my equal share of the negroes
without providing any part of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been
made to any one that had not had a settlement and plantation
of his own to look after, which was in a fair way of coming to
be very considerable, and with a good stock upon it. But for
me, that was thus entered and established, and had nothing to
do but go on as I had begun, for three or four years more, and
to have sent for the other hundred pounds from England; and
who, in that time, and with that little addition, could scarce
have failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds
sterling, and that increasing too—for me to think of such a
voyage, was the most preposterous thing that ever man, in such
circumstances, could be guilty of.
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no
more resist the offer than I could restrain my first rambling
designs, when my father's good counsel was lost upon me. In
a word, I told them I would go with all my heart, if they would
undertake to look after my plantation in my absence, and
would dispose of it to such as I should direct if I miscarried.
This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings or
covenants to do so; and I made a formal will, disposing of my
plantation and effects, in case of my death; making the captain
of the ship that had saved my life, as before, my universal heir,
but obliging him to dispose of my effects as I had directed in
my will; one half of the produce being to himself, and the other
to be shipped to England.
In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects,
and keep up my plantation. Had I used half as much
prudence to have looked into my own interest, and have made
a judgment of what I ought to have done and not to have
done, I had certainly never gone away from so prosperous an
undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a thriving cir-
cumstance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with all
its common hazards, to say nothing of the reasons I had to ex-
pect particular misfortunes to myself.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of
my fancy rather than my reason. And accordingly, the ship
being fitted out, and the cargo furnished, and all things done as
by agreement by my partners in the voyage, I went on board
in an evil hour, the [first] of [September 1659], being the same
day eight year that I went from my father and mother at Hull,
in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my
own interest.
Our ship was about 120 tons burthen, carried six guns and
fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, and myself. We had
on board no large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were
fit for our trade with the negroes—such as beads, bits of glass,
shells, and odd trifles, especially little looking-glasses, knives,
scissors, hatchets, and the like.
The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away
to the northward upon our own coast, with design to stretch
over for the African coast, when they came about ten or twelve
degrees of northern latitude, which, it seems, was the manner of
their course in those days. We passed the line in about twelve
days' time, and were, by our last observation, in seven degrees
twenty-two minutes northern latitude, when a violent tornado,
or hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge. It began
from the south-east, came about to the north-west, and then
settled into the north-east, from whence it blew in such a
terrible manner, that for twelve days together we could do
nothing but drive, and, scudding away before it, let it carry us
wherever fate and the fury of the winds directed; and during
these twelve days, I need not say that I expected every day to
be swallowed up, nor, indeed, did any in the ship expect to save
their lives.
In this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one
of our men died of the calenture, and one man and the boy
washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the weather abating
a little, the master made an observation as well as he could,
and found that he was gotten upon the coast of Guiana, or the
north part of Brazil, beyond the river Amazon, toward that of
the river Orinoco, commonly called the Great River, and began
to consult with me what course we should take, for the ship was
leaky and very much disabled, and he was going directly back
to the coast of Brazil.
I was positively against that; and looking over the charts
of the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was
no inhabited country for us to have recourse to till we came
within the circle of the Carribbee Islands, and therefore resolved
to stand away for the Barbadoes, which by keeping off at sea,
to avoid the indraft of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico, we might
easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days' sail; whereas
we could not possibly make our voyage to the coast of
Africa without some assistance, both to our ship and to
ourselves.
With this design we changed our course, and steered away
N.W. by W. in order to reach some of our English islands,
where I hoped for relief; but our voyage was otherwise deter-
mined; for a second storm came upon us, which carried us
away with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out
of the very way of all human commerce, that had all our lives
been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in danger of
being devoured by savages than ever returning to our own
country.
In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of
our men early in the morning cried out, "Land!" and we had
no sooner ran out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing
whereabouts in the world we were, but the ship struck upon a
sand, and in a moment, her motion being so stopped, the sea
broke over her in such a manner, that we expected we should
all have perished immediately; and we were immediately driven
into our close quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and
spray of the sea.
It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the like
condition, to describe or conceive the consternation of men in
such circumstances. We knew nothing where we were, or
upon what land it was we were driven, whether an island or the
main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; and as the rage of
the wind was still great, though rather less than at first, we
could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many
minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the winds, by a kind
of miracle, should turn immediately about. In a word, we sat
looking one upon another, and expecting death every moment,
and every man acting accordingly, as preparing for another
world; for there was little or nothing more for us to do in this.
That which was our present comfort, and all the comfort
we had, was that, contrary to our expectation, the ship did
not break yet, and that the master said the wind began to
abate.
Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate,
yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too
fast for us to expect her getting off, we were in a dreadful con-
dition indeed, and had nothing to do but to think of saving our
lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our stern just
before the storm, but she was first staved by dashing against
the ship's rudder, and in the next place, she broke away, and
either sunk, or was driven off to sea, so there was no hope
from her; we had another boat on board, but how to get her off
into the sea was a doubtful thing. However, there was no
room to debate, for we fancied the ship would break in pieces
every minute, and some told us she was actually broken already.

THEY COT HER SLUNG OVER THE SHIP'S SIDE..
In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of the
boat, and with the help of the rest of the men they got her slung
over the ship's side; and getting all into her, let go, and com-
mitted ourselves, being eleven in number, to God's mercy, and
the wild sea; for though the storm was abated considerably, yet
the sea went dreadful high upon the shore.
And now our case was very dismal indeed, for we all saw
plainly that the sea went so high, that the boat could not live,
and that we should be inevitably drowned. However, we
committed our souls to God in the most earnest manner; and
the wind driving us towards the shore, we hastened our
destruction with our own hands, pulling as well as we could
towards land.
What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or
shoal, we knew not; the only hope that could rationally give
us the least shadow of expectation was, if we might happen
into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some river, where by
great chance we might have run our boat in, or got under the
lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But
there was nothing of this appeared; but as we made nearer
and nearer the shore, the land looked more frightful than
the sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a
half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came
rolling astern of us, and plainly bade us expect the coup de
grace. In a word, it took us with such a fury, that it overset
the boat at once; and separating us, as well from the boat as
from one another, gave us not time hardly to say, " O God!"
for we were all swallowed up in a moment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt
when I sunk into the water; for though I swam very well, yet
I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw
breath, till that wave having driven me, or rather carried me, a
vast way on towards the shore, and having spent itself, went
back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead with
the water I took in. I had so much presence of mind, as well
as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the mainland than I
expected, I got upon my feet, and endeavoured to make on
towards the land as fast as I could, before another wave should
return and take me up again. But I soon found it was im-
possible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me as high
as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy, which I had no
means or strength to contend with. My business was to hold
my breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I could; and so,
by swimming, to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself
towards the shore, if possible; my greatest concern now being,
that the sea, as it would carry me a great way towards the
shore when it came on, might not carry me back again with it
when it gave back towards the sea.
The wave that came upon me again, buried me at once
20 or 30 feet deep in its own body, and I could feel myself
carried with a mighty force and swiftness towards the shore a
very great way; but I held my breath, and assisted myself to
swim still forward with all my might. I was ready to burst
with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising up, so, to
my immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot out
above the surface of the water; and though it was not two
seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me
c
greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I was covered
again with water a good while, but not so long but I held it out;
and finding the water had spent itself, and began to return, I
struck forward against the return of the waves, and felt ground
again with my feet. I stood still a few moments to recover
breath, and till the water went from me, and then took to my
heels and ran with what strength I had farther towards the
shore. But neither would this deliver me from the fury of the
sea, which came pouring in after me again, and twice more I
was lifted up by the waves and carried forwards as before, the
shore being very flat.
The last time of these two had well near been fatal to me;
for the sea, having hurried me along as before, landed me, or
rather dashed me, against a piece of a rock, and that with such
force, as it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own
deliverance; for the blow taking my side and breast, beat the
breath as it were quite out of my body; and had it returned
again immediately, I must have been strangled in the water.
But I recovered a little before the return of the waves, and see-
ing I should be covered again with the water, I resolved to hold
fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible,
till the wave went back. Now as the waves were not so high as
at first, being near land, I held my hold till the wave abated,
and then fetched another run, which brought me so near the
shore, that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did not
so swallow me up as to carry me away, and the next run I took
I got to the mainland, where, to my great comfort, I
clambered up the cliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon the
grass, free from danger, and quite out of the reach of the
water.
I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up
and thank God that my life was saved in a case wherein there
was some minutes before scarce any room to hope.
I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my
whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in the contemplation of
my deliverance, making a thousand gestures and motions which
I cannot describe, reflecting upon all my comrades that were
drowned, and that there should not be one soul saved but my-
self; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any sign
of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that
were not fellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the breach and
froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far
off, and considered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on
shore?
After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of
ray condition, I began to look round me to see what kind of
place I was in, and what was next to be done, and I soon found
my comforts abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful
deliverance; for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor any-
thing either to eat or drink to comfort me, neither did I see any
prospect before me but that of perishing with hunger, or being
devoured by wild beasts; and that which was particularly
afflicting to me was, that I had no weapon either to hunt and
kill any creature for my sustenance, or to defend myself against
any other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a
word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and
a little tobacco in a box. This was all my provision; and this
threw me into terrible agonies of mind, that for a while I ran
about like a madman. Night coming upon me, I began, with
a heavy heart, to consider what would be my lot if there were
any ravenous beasts in that country, seeingat night they always
come abroad for their prey.
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time
was, to get up into a thick bushy tree like a fir, but thorny, which
grew near me, and where I resolved to sit all night, and consider
the next day what death I should die, for as yet I saw no
prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from the shore, to see
if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I did, to my great
joy; and having drank, and put a little tobacco in my mouth
to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into it,
endeavoured to place myself so, as that if I should sleep I
might not fall; and having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon,
for my defence, I took up my lodging, and having been
excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably
as, I believe, few could have done in my condition, and found
myself the most refreshed with it that I think I ever was on
such an occasion.
When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the
storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before.
But that which surprised me most was, that the ship was lifted
off in the night from the sand where she lay, by the swelling of
the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock which I
first mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the dashing me
against it. This being within about a mile from the shore where
I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished
myself on board, that, at least, I might have some necessary
things for my use.
When I came down from my apartment in the tree I looked
about me again, and the first thing I found was the boat, which
lay as the wind and the sea had tossed her up upon the land,
about two miles on my right hand. I walked as far as I could
upon the shore to have got to her, but found a neck or inlet of
water between me and the boat, which was about half a mile
broad; so I came back for the present, being more intent upon
getting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my
present subsistence.
A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide
ebbed so far out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile
of the ship; and here I found a fresh renewing of my grief, for
I saw evidently, that if we had kept on board we had been all
safe, that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not
been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort
and company, as I now was. This forced tears from my eyes
again; but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if
possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled off my clothes, for the
weather was hot to extremity, and took the water. But when
I came to the ship, my difficulty was still greater to know how
to get on board; for as she lay aground, and high out of the
water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I
swam round her twice, and the second time I spied a small
piece of a rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hang
down by the fore-chains so low, as that with great difficulty I
got hold of it, and by the help of that rope got up into the fore-
castle of the ship. Here I found that the ship was bulged, and
had a great deal of water in her hold, but that she lay so on the
side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stern lay
lifted up upon the bank, and her head low almost to the water.
By this means all her quarter was free, and all that was in that
part was dry; for you may be sure my first work was to search
and to see what was spoiled and what was free. And first I
found that all the ship's provisions were dry and untouched by
the water; and being very we.ll disposed to eat, I went to the
bread-room and filled my pockets with biscuit, and eat it as I
went about other things, for I had no time to lose. I also
found some rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large dram,
and which I had indeed need enough of to spirit me for what
was before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat, to furnish
myself with many things which I foresaw would be very
necessary to me.
It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be
had, and this extremity roused my application. We had
several spare yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and
a spare top-mast or two in the ship. I resolved to fall to work
with these, and flung as many of them overboard as I could
manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope, that they
might not drive away. When this was done I went down the
ship's side, and, pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast
together at both ends as well as I could, in the form of a raft;
and laying two or three short pieces of plank upon them cross-
ways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it was
not able to bear any great weight, the pieces being too light.
So I went to work, and with the carpenter's saw I cut a spare
top-mast into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with a
great deal of labour and pains; but hope of furnishing myself
with necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what I should
have been able to have done upon another occasion.
My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable
weight. My next care was what to load it with, and how to
preserve what I laid upon it from the surf of the sea ; but I was
not long considering this. I first laid all the planks or boards
upon it that I could get, and having considered well what I
most wanted, I first got three of the seamen's chests, which I
had broken open, and emptied, and lowered them down upon
my raft. The first of these I filled with provisions, viz., bread,
rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's flesh, which
we lived much upon, and a little remainder of European corn,
which had been laid by for some fowls which we brought to sea
with us, but the fowls were killed. There had been some barley
and wheat together, but, to my great disappointment, I found
afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As for
liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging to our
skipper, in which were some cordial waters, and, in all, about
five or six gallons of rack. These I stowed by themselves,
there being no need to put them into the chest, nor no room for
them. While I was doing this, I found the tide began to flow,
though very calm, and I had the mortification to see my coat,
shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on shore upon the sand,
swim away; as for my breeches, which were only linen, and
open-kneed, I swam on board in them, and my stockings.
However, this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which I
found enough, but took no more than I wanted for present use;
for I had other things which my eye was more upon, as
first tools to work with on shore; and it was after long search-
ing that I found out the carpenter's chest, which was indeed a
very useful prize to me, and much more valuable than a ship-
loading of gold would have been at that time. I got it down
to my raft, even whole as it was, without losing time to look
into it, for I knew in general what it contained.
My next care was for some ammunition and arms; there
were two very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two
pistols; these I secured first, with some powder-horns, and a
small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. I knew there
were three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not where
our gunner had stowed them; but with much search I found
them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken water;
those two I got to my raft with the arms. And now I thought
myself pretty well freighted, and began to think how I should
get to shore with them, having neither sail, oar, or rudder; and
the least capful of wind would have overset all my navigation.
I had three encouragements, i. A smooth calm sea. 2.
The tide rising and setting in to the shore. 3. What little wind
there was blew me towards the land. And thus, having found
two or three broken oars belonging to the boat, and besides the
tools which were in the chest, I found two saws, an axe, and a
hammer, and with this cargo I put to sea. For a mile or there-
abouts my raft went very well, only that I found it drive a little
distance from the place where I had landed before, by which I
perceived that there was some indraft of the water, and conse-
quently I hoped to find some creek or river there, which I might
make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was; there appeared before me a little
opening of the land, and I found a strong current of the tide
set into it, so I guided my raft as well as I could to keep in the
middle of the stream. But here I had like to have suffered a
second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have
broke my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast, my raft ran
aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not being aground
at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo had
slipped off towards that end that was afloat, and so fallen into
the water. I did my utmost by setting my back against the
chests to keep them in their places, but could not thrust off the
raft with all my strength, neither durst I stir from the posture
I was in, but holding up the chests with all my might, stood in
that manner near half-an-hour, in which time the rising of the
water brought me a little more upon a level; and a little after,
the water still rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her off
with the oar I had into the channel, and then driving up higher,
I at length found myself in the mouth of a little river, with
land on both sides, and a strong current or tide running up. I
looked on both sides for a proper place to get to shore, for I
was not willing to be driven too high up the river, hoping in
time to see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place
myself as near the coast as I could.
At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the
creek, to which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my
raft, and at last got so near, as that, reaching ground with my
oar, I could thrust her directly in; but here I had like to have
dipped all my cargo in the sea again; for that shore lying
pretty steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no place to land
but where one end of my float, if it run on shore, would lie so
high and the other sink lower, as before, that it would endanger
my cargo again. All that I could do was to wait till the tide
was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor
to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of
ground, which I expected the water would flow over; and so it
did. As soon as I found water enough, for my raft drew about
a foot of water, I thrust her on upon that flat piece of ground,
and there fastened or moored her by sticking my two broken
oars into the ground; one on one side near one end, and one on
the other side near the other end; and thus I lay till the
water ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.
My next work was to view the country and seek a proper
place for my habitation, and where to stow my goods to secure
them from whatever might happen. Where I was, I yet knew
not; whether on the continent, or on an island; whether
inhabited or not inhabited; whether in danger of wild beasts, or
not. There was a hill, not above a mile from me, which rose up
very steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some other
hills, which lay as in a ridge from it, northward. I took out
one of the fowling-pieces and one of the pistols, and a horn of
powder; and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the top
of that hill, where, after I had with great labour and difficulty
got to the top, I saw my fate to my great affliction, viz., that I
was in an island environed every way with the sea, no land to
be seen, except some rocks which lay a great way off, and two
small islands less than this, which lay about three leagues to
the west.
I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I
saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts,
of whom, however, I saw none; yet I saw abundance of fowls,
but knew not their kinds; neither, when I killed them, could I
tell what was fit for food, and what not. At my coming back,
I shot at a great bird which I saw sitting upon a tree on the
side of a great wood. I believe it was the first gun that had
been fired there since the creation of the world. I had no
sooner fired, but from all the parts of the wood there arose an
innumerable number of fowls of many sorts, making a confused
screaming, and crying everyone according to his usual note;
but not one of them of any kind that I knew. As for the
creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of a hawk, its colour and
beak resembling it, but had no talons or claws more than
common; its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing.
Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and
fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the
rest of that day; and what to do with myself at night, I knew
not, nor indeed where to rest; for I was afraid to lie down on
the ground, not knowing but some wild beast might devour me,
though, as I afterwards found, there was really no need for
those fears. However, as well as I could, I barricaded myself
round with the chests and boards that I had brought on shore,
and made a kind of a hut for that night's lodging; as for food,
I yet saw not which way to supply myself, except that I had
seen two or three creatures like hares run out of the wood where
I shot the fowl.
I now began to consider, that I might yet get a great many
things out of the ship, which would be useful to me, and
particularly some of the rigging and sails, and such other things
as might come to land; and I resolved to make another voyage
on board the vessel, if possible. And as I knew that the first
storm that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I
resolved to set all other things apart till I got everything out
of the ship that I could get. Then I called a council, that is to
say, in my thoughts, whether I should take back the raft, but
this appeared impracticable; so I resolved to go as before, when
the tide was down; and I did so, only that I stripped before I
went from my hut, having nothing on but a chequered shirt and
a pair of linen drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.
I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second
raft, and having had experience of the first, I neither made this
so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard; but yet I brought away
several things very useful to me; as, first, in the carpenter's
stores I found two or three bags full of nails and spikes, a great
screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and above all, that most
useful thing called a grindstone. All these I secured, together
with several things belonging to the gunner, particularly two or
three iron crows, and two barrels of musket bullets, seven
muskets, and another fowling-piece, with some small quantity
of powder more; a large bag full of small-shot, and a great roll
of sheet lead; but this last was so heavy, I could not hoist it up
to get it over the ship's side. Besides these things, I took all
the men's clothes that I could find, and a spare fore-top sail, a
hammock, and some bedding; and with this I loaded my second
raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to my very great
comfort
.
I was under some apprehensions during my absence from
the land, that at least my provisions might be devoured on
shore; but when I came back, I found no sign of any visitor,
only there sat a creature like a wild cat upon one of the chests,
which, when I came towards it, ran away a little distance, and
then stood still. She sat very composed and unconcerned, and
looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted
with me. I presented my gun at her; but as she did not under-
stand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer
to stir away; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though,
by the way, I was not very free of it, for my store was not great.
However, I spared her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled
of it, and ate it, and looked (as pleased) for more; but I thanked
her, and could spare no more, so she marched off.
Having got my second cargo on shore, though I was fain to
open the barrels of powder and bring them by parcels, for they
were too heavy, being large casks, I went to work to make me a
little tent with the sail and some poles which I cut for that
purpose; and into this tent I brought everything that I knew
would spoil either with rain or sun; and I piled all the empty
chests and casks up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it from
any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.
When I had done this I blocked up the door of the tent
with some boards within, and an empty chest set up on end
without; and spreading one of the beds upon the ground, laying
my two pistols just at my head, and my gun at length by me,
I went to bed for the first time, and slept very quietly all night,
for I was very weary and heavy; for the night before I had
slept little, and had laboured very hard all day, as well to fetch
all those things from the ship, as to get them on shore.
I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was
laid up, I believe, for one man ; but I was not satisfied still, for
while the ship sat upright in that posture, I thought I ought to
get everything out of her that I could. So every day at low
water I went on board, and brought away something or other;
but, particularly, the third time I went I brought away as much
of the rigging as I could, as also all the small ropes and rope-twine
I could get, with a piece of spare canvas, which was to mend the
sails upon occasion, the barrel of wet gunpowder; in a word, I
brought away all the sails first and last, only that I was fain to
cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could; for
they were no more useful to be sails, but as mere canvas only.
But that which comforted me more still was, that at last of
all, after I had made five or six such voyages as these, and
thought I had nothing more to expect from the ship that was
worth my meddling with; I say, after all this, I found a great
hogshead of bread, and three large runlets of rum or spirits, and
a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour; this was surprising to
me, because I had given over expecting any more provisions,
except what was spoilt by the water. I soon emptied the hogs-
head of that bread, and wrapped it up parcel by parcel in pieces
of the sails, which I cut out; and, in a word, I got all this safe
on shore also.
The next day I made another voyage. And now, having
plundered the ship of what was portable and fit to hand out, I
began with the cables; and cutting the great cable into pieces,
such as I could move, I got two cables and a hawser on shore,
with all the iron-work 1 could get; and having cut down the
sprit-sailyard, and the mizzen-yard, and everything I could to
make a large raft, I loaded it with all those heavy goods, and
came away. But my good luck began now to leave me; for
this raft was so unwieldy, and so overladen, that after I was
entered the little cove where I had landed the rest of my goods,
not being able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it
overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the water. As
for myself, it was no great harm, for I was near the shore; but
as to my cargo, it was great part of it lost, especially the iron,
which I expected would have been of great use to me. How-
ever, when the tide was out I got most of the pieces of cable
ashore, and some of the iron, though with infinite labour; for
I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued
me very much. After this I went every day on board, and
brought away what I could get.
I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven
times on board the ship; in which time I had brought away all
that one pair of hands could well be supposed capable to bring,
though I believe verily, had the calm weather held, I should
have brought away the whole ship piece by piece. But prepar-
ing the twelfth time to go on board, I found the wind begin to
rise. However, at low water I went on board, and though I
thought I had rummaged the cabin so effectually as that
nothing more could be found, yet I discovered a locker with
drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three razors, and
one pair of large scissors, with some ten or a dozen of good
knives and forks; in another, I found about thirty-six pounds
value in money, some European coin, some Brazil, some pieces
of eight, some gold, some silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. "O drug!"
said I aloud," what art thou good for? Thou art not worth to
me, no, not the taking off of the ground; one of those knives
is worth all this heap. I have no manner of use for thee; even
remain where thou art, and go to the bottom as a creature
whose life is not worth saving." However, upon second
thoughts, I took it away; and wrapping all this in a piece of
canvas, I began to think of making another raft; but while I
was preparing this, I found the sky overcast, and the wind
began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale
from the shore. It presently occurred to me that it was in vain
to pretend to make a raft with the wind off shore, and that it
was my business to be gone before the tide of flood began,
otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at all.
Accordingly I let myself down into the water, and swam across
the channel, which lay between the ship and the sands, and
even that with difficulty enough, partly with the weight of the
things I had about me, and partly the roughness of the water;
for the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high
water it blew a storm.
But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay with
all my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all
that night, and in the morning, when I looked out, behold, no
more ship was to be seen. I was a little surprised, but recovered
myself with this satisfactory reflection, viz., that I had lost no
time, nor abated no diligence, to get everything out of her
that could be useful to me, and that indeed there was little
left in her that I was able to bring away if I had had more
time.
I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of any-
thing out of her, except what might drive on shore from her
wreck, as indeed divers pieces of her afterwards did; but those
things were of small use to me.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing
myself against either savages, if any should appear, or wild
beasts, if any were in the island; and I had many thoughts of
the method how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to make,
whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon
the earth; and, in short, I resolved upon both, the manner and
description of which it may not be improper to give an
account of.
I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement,
particularly because it was upon a low moorish ground near
the sea, and I believed would not be wholesome; and more
particularly because there was no fresh water near it. So I
resolved to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of
ground.
I consulted several things in my situation, which I found
would be proper for me. First, health and fresh water, I just
now mentioned. Secondly, shelter from the heat of the sun.
Thirdly, security from ravenous creatures, whether men or
beasts. Fourthly, a view to the sea, that if God sent any ship
in sight I might not lose any advantage for my deliverance, of
which I was not willing to banish all my expectation yet.
In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on
the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was
steep as a house-side, so that nothing could come down upon
me from the top; on the side of this rock there was a hollow
place, worn a little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave;
but there was not really any cave, or way into the rock at all.
On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I
resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above an hundred
yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay like a green
before my door, and at the end of it descended irregularly
every way down into the low grounds by the seaside. It was
on the NNW. side of the hill, so that I was sheltered from the
heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or there-
abouts, which in those countries is near the setting.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle before the
hollow place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter
from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter from its
beginning and ending. In this half-circle I pitched two rows
of strong stakes, driving them into the ground till they stood
very firm like piles, the biggest end being out of the ground
about five feet and a half, and sharpened on the top. The two
rows did not stand above six inches from one another.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship,
and laid them in rows one upon another, within the circle,
between these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other
stakes in the inside leaning against them, about two feet and
a half high, like a spur to a post; and this fence was so strong,
that neither man or beast could get into it, or over it. This
cost me a great deal of time and labour, especially to cut the
piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive them
into the earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be not by a door,
but by a short ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when
I was in, I lifted over after me, and so I was completely fenced
in, and fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and
consequently slept secure in the night, which otherwise I could
not have done; though as it appeared afterward, there was no
need of all this caution from the enemies that I apprehended
danger from.
Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all
my riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which
you have the account above; and I made me a large tent,
which, to preserve me from the rains that in one part of the
year are very violent there, I made double, viz., one smaller
tent within, and one larger tent above it, and covered the
uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had saved among
the sails. And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which
I had brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed
a very good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship.
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything
that would spoil by the wet; and having thus enclosed all my
goods, I made up the entrance, which, till now, I had left open,
and so passed and repassed, as I said, by a short ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my way into the
rock; and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down
out through my tent, I laid them up within my fence in the
nature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground within about a
foot and a half; and thus I made me a cave just behind my
tent, which served me like a cellar to my house.
It cost me much labour, and many days, before all these
things were brought to perfection, and therefore I must go
back to some other things which took up some of my thoughts.
At the same time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for
the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that a storm of
rain falling from a thick dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning
happened, and after that a great clap of thunder, as is naturally
the effect of it. I was not so much surprised with the
lightning, as I was with a thought which darted into my mind
as swift as the lightning itself. O my powder! My very
heart sunk within me when I thought, that at one blast all my
powder might be destroyed, on which, not my defence only,
but the providing me food, as I thought, entirely depended.
I was nothing near so anxious about my own danger; though
had the powder took fire, I had never known who had hurt me.
Such impression did this make upon me, that after the
storm was over I laid aside all my works, my building, and
fortifying, and applied myself to make bags and boxes to
separate the powder, and keep it a little and a little in a parcel,
in hope that whatever might come it might not all take fire at
once, and to keep it so apart, that it should not be possible to
make one part fire another. I finished this work in about a
fortnight; and I think my powder, which in all was about 240
pounds' weight, was divided in not less than a hundred parcels.
As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any
danger from that, so I placed it in my new cave, which in my
fancy I called my kitchen, and the rest I hid up and down in
holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come to it,
marking very carefully where I laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out
once, at least, every day with my gun, as well to divert myself,

I HAD FREQUENTLY A FAIR MARK.
as to see if I could kill anything fit for food, and as near as I
could to acquaint myself with what the island produced. The
first time I went out, I presently discovered that there were
goats in the island, which was a great satisfaction to me; but
then it was attended with this misfortune to me, viz., that they
were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the
difficultest thing in the world to come at them. But I was not
discouraged at this, not doubting but I might now and then
shoot one, as it soon happened; for after I had found their
haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for them. I observed
if they saw me in the valleys, though they were upon the rocks,
they would run away as in a terrible fright; but if they were
feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the rocks, they took no
notice of me, from whence I concluded that, by the position
of their optics, their sight was so directed downward, that they
did not readily see objects that were above them. So after-
ward I took this method; I always climbed the rocks first to
get above them, and then had frequently a fair mark. The
first shot I made among these creatures I killed a she-goat,
which had a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, which
grieved me heartily; but when the old one fell, the kid stood
stock still by her till I came and took her up; and not only so,
but when I carried the old one with me upon my shoulders,
the kid followed me quite to my enclosure; upon which I laid
down the dam, and took the kid in my arms, and carried it over
my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame; but it would not
eat, so I was forced to kill it, and eat it myself. These two
supplied me with flesh a great while, for I eat sparingly, and
saved my provisions, my bread especially, as much as possibly
I could.
And now being to enter into a melancholy relation of a
scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the
world before, I shall take it from its beginning, and continue it
in its order. It was, by my account, the 3Oth of September
when, in the manner as above said, I first set foot upon this
horrid island, when the sun being to us in its autumnal equinox,
was almost just over my head, for I reckoned myself, by obser-
vation, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees 22 minutes north of
the line.
After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into
my thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of
books and pen and ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days
from the working days ; but to prevent this, I cut it with my knife
upon a large post, in capital letters; and making it into a great
cross, I set it up on the shore where I first landed, viz.," I came
on shore here on the 3Oth of September 1659." Upon the sides
of this square post I cut every day a notch with my knife, and
every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and every first
day of the month as long again as that long one; and thus I kept
my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of
time.
In the next place we are to observe, that among the many
things which I brought out of the ship in the several voyages,
which, as above mentioned, I made to it, I got several things of
less value, but not all less useful to me, which I omitted set-
ting down before; as in particular, pens, ink, and paper, several
parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keep-
ing, three or four compasses, some mathematical instruments,
dials, perspectives, charts, and books of navigation, all which I
huddled together, whether I might want them or no. Also I
found three very good Bibles, which came to me in my cargo
D
from England, and which I had packed up among my things;
some Portuguese books also, and among them two or three
Popish prayer-books, and several other books, all which I
carefully secured. And I must not forget, that we had in the
ship a dog and two cats, of whose eminent history I may have
occasion to say something in its place; for I carried both the
cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the ship of
himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I went on
shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many
years. I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any com-
pany that he could make up to me; I only wanted to have him
talk to me, but that would not do. As I observed before, I
found pen, ink, and paper, and I husbanded them to the
utmost; and I shall show that while my ink lasted, I kept
things very exact; but after that was gone, I could not, for I
could not make any ink by any means that I could devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, not-
withstanding all that I had amassed together; and of these,
this of ink was one, as also spade, pickaxe, and shovel, to dig
or remove the earth, needles, pins, and thread; as for linen,
I soon learned to want that without much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily;
and it was near a whole year before I had entirely finished
my little pale or surrounded habitation. The piles or stakes,
which were as heavy as I could well lift, were a long time
in cutting and preparing in the woods, and more by far in
bringing home; so that I spent sometimes two days in
cutting and bringing home one of those posts, and a third
day in driving it into the ground; for which purpose I got a
heavy piece of wood at first, but at last bethought myself of
one of the iron crows, which, however, though I found it, yet
it made driving those posts or piles very laborious and tedious
work.
But what need I have been concerned at the tediousness of
anything I had to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in?
nor had I any other employment, if that had been over, at
least, that I could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek
for food, which I did more or less every day.
I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the
circumstance I was reduced to; and I drew up the state of my
affairs in writing; not so much to leave them to any that were
to come after me, for I was like to have but few heirs, as to
deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon them, and afflict-
ing my mind. And as my reason began now to master my
despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could, and
to set the good against the evil, that I might have something
to distinguish my case from worse; and I stated it very
impartially, like debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed
against the miseries I suffered, thus:
Evil.
I am cast upon a horrible
desolate island, void of all
hope of recovery.
I am singled out and sepa-
rated, as it were, from all the
world to be miserable.
I am divided from mankind,
a solitaire, one banished from
human society.
I have not clothes to cover
me.
I am without any defence or
means to resist any violence of
man or beast.
I have no soul to speak to,
or relieve me.
Good,
But I am alive, and not
drowned, as all my ship's com-
pany was.
But I am singled out, too,
from all the ship's crew to be
spared from death; and He
that miraculously saved me
from death, can deliver me
from this condition.
But I am not starved and
perishing on a barren place,
affording no sustenance.
But I am in a hot climate,
where if I had clothes I could
hardly wear them.
But I am cast on an island,
where I see no wild beasts to
hurt me, as I saw on the coast
of Africa; and what if I had
been shipwrecked there?
But God wonderfully sent
the ship in near enough to the
shore, that I have gotten out
so many necessary things as
will either supply my wants,
or enable me to supply myself
even as long as I live.
Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition,
and given over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship; I
say, giving over these things, I began to apply myself to ac-
commodate my way of living, and to make things as easy to
me as I could.
I have already described my habitation, which was a tent
under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts
and cables; but I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a
kind of wall up against it of turfs, about two feet thick on the
outside, and after some time—I think it was a year and a half
—I raised rafters from it leaning to the rock, and thatched or
covered it with boughs of trees and such things as I could
get to keep out the rain, which I found at some times of the
year very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my goods into
this pale, and into the cave which I had made behind me. But
I must observe, too, that at first this was a confused heap of
goods, which as they lay in no order, so they took up all my
place; I had no room to turn myself. So I set myself to en-
large my cave and works farther into the earth; for it was a
loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour I bestowed
on it. And so, when I found I was pretty safe as to beasts of
prey, I worked sideways to the right hand into the rock; and
then, turning to the right again, worked quite out, and made me
a door to come out on the outside of my pale or fortification.
This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were a back-
way to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to
stow my goods.
And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary
things as I found I most wanted, as particularly a chair and a
table; for without these I was not able to enjoy the few
comforts I had in the world. I could not write or eat, or do
several things with so much pleasure without a table.
I had never handled a tool in my life; and yet in time, by
labour, application, and contrivance, I found at last that I
wanted nothing but I could have made it, especially if I had
had tools. However, I made abundance of things even without
tools, and some with no more tools than an adze and a hatchet,
which, perhaps were never made that way before, and that with
infinite labour. For example, if I wanted a board, I had no
other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an edge before me,
and hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I had brought it
to be thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze.
It is true, by this method I could make but one board out of a
whole tree; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any
more than I had for the prodigious deal of time and labour
which it took me up to make a plank or board. But my time
or labour was little worth, and so it was as well employed one
way as another.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed
above, in the first place, and this I did out of the short pieces of
boards that I brought on my raft from the ship. But when I
had wrought out some boards, as above, I made large shelves
of the breadth of a foot and a half one over another, all along
one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-work;
and, in a word, to separate everything at large in their places,
that I might come easily at them. I knocked pieces into the
wall of the rock to hang my guns and all things that would
hang up; so that had my cave been to be seen, it looked like a
general magazine of all necessary things; and I had everything
so ready at my hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to see
all my goods in such order, and especially to find my stock of
all necessaries so great.
And now it was when I began to keep a journal of every
day's employment; for, indeed, at first, I was in too much hurry,
and not only hurry as to labour, but in too much discomposure
of mind; and my journal would have been full of many dull
things.
But having gotten over these things in some measure, and
having settled my household stuff and habitation, made me a
table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I
began to keep my journal, of which I shall here give you the copy
(though in it will be told all these particulars over again) as long
as it lasted; for, having no more ink, I was forced to leave
it off.
EXTRACTS FROM THE JOURNAL
Nov. 4.—This morning I began to order my times of work,
of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion,
viz., every morning I walked out with my gun for two or three
hours, if it did not rain; then employed myself to work till
about eleven o'clock; then eat what I had to live on; and from
twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather being excessive
hot; and then in the evening to work again. The working
part of this day and of .the next were wholly employed in making
my table; for I was yet but a very sorry workman, though
time and necessity made me a complete natural mechanic soon
after, as I believe it would do any one else.
Nov. 5.—This day went abroad with my gun and my dog,
and killed a wild cat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good
for nothing. Every creature I killed, I took off the skins and
preserved them. Coming back by the sea-shore, I saw many
sorts of sea-fowls, which I did not understand; but was
surprised, and almost frighted, with two or three seals, which,
while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got
into the sea, and escaped me for that time.
Nov. 6.—After my morning walk I went to work with my
table again, and finished it, though not to my liking; nor was
it long before I learned to mend it.
Nov. 7.— Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th,
8th, gth, loth, and part of the I2th (for the nth was Sunday)
I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with much ado,
brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please me; and
even in the making, I pulled it in pieces several times. Note I
soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting my mark
for them on my post, I forgot which was which.
Nov. 17.—This day I began to dig behind my tent into the
rock, to make room for my farther conveniency. Note, three
things I wanted exceedingly for this work, viz., a pick-axe, a
shovel, and a wheelbarrow or basket; so I desisted from my
work, and began to consider how to supply that want, and
make me some tools. As for a pick-axe, I made use of the iron
crows, which were proper enough, though heavy; but the next
thing was a shovel or spade. This was so absolutely necessary,
that indeed I could do nothing effectually without it; but what
kind of one to make, I knew not.
Nov. 18.—The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree
of that wood, or like it, which in the Brazils they call the iron-tree,
for its exceeding hardness; of this, with great labour, and almost
spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home, too, with
difficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy.
The excessive hardness of the wood, and having no other
way, made me a long while upon this machine, for I worked it
effectually, by little and little, into the form of a shovel or spade,
the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the
broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not
last me so long.
I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheelbarrow.
A basket I could not make by any means, having no such things
as twigs that would bend to make wicker ware, at least none yet
found out. And as to a wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make
all but the wheel, but that I had no notion of, neither did I
know how to go about it; besides, I had no possible way to
make the iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the wheel to
run in, so I gave it over; and so for carrying away the earth
which I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod
which the labourers carry mortar in, when they serve the brick-
layers.
Nov. 23.—My other work having now stood still because of
my making these tools, when they were finished I went on, and
working every day, as my strength and time allowed, I spent
eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my cave,
that it might hold my goods commodiously.
Note: During all this time I worked to make this room or
cave spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or
magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar; as for my
lodging, I kept to the tent, except that sometimes in the wet
season of the year it rained so hard, that I could not keep
myself dry, which caused me afterwards to cover all my place
within my pale with long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning
against the rock, and load them with flags and large leaves of
trees, like a thatch.
December 10.—I began now to think my cave or vault
finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had made it too large)
a great quantity of earth fell down from the top and one side,
so much, that, in short, it frighted me, and not without reason
too; for if I had been under it, I had never wanted a grave-
digger. Upon this disaster I had a great deal of work to do
over again; for I had the loose earth to carry out; and, which
was of more importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I
might be sure no more would come down.
Dec. 11.—This day I went to work with it accordingly, and
got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two
pieces of boards across over each post. This I finished the
next day; and setting more posts up with boards, in about a
week more I had the roof secured; and the posts standing in
rows, served me for partitions to part of my house.
Dec 17.—From this day to the twentieth I placed shelves,
and knocked up nails on the posts to hang everything up that
could be hung up; and now I began to be in some order within
doors.
Dec. 20.—Now I carried everything into the cave, and began
to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards, like a
dresser, to order my victuals upon ; but boards began to be very
scarce with me; also I made me another table.
Dec. 24.—Much rain all night and all day; no stirring out.
Dec. 25.—Rain all day.
Dec. 26.—No rain, and the earth much cooler than before,
and pleasanter.
Dec. 27.—Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so that I
catched it, and led it home in a string. When 1 had it home, I
bound and splintered up its leg, which was broke. N.B.—I
took such care of it, that it lived, and the leg grew well and as
strong as ever; but by my nursing it so long it grew tame, and
fed upon the little green at my door, and would not go away.
This was the first time that I entertained a thought of breeding
up some tame creatures, that I might have food when my
powder and shot was all spent.
Dec. 28, 29, 30.—Great heats and no breeze, so that there
was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food. This
time I spent in putting all my things in order within doors.
January I.—Very hot still, but I went abroad early and late
with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This
evening, going farther into the valleys which lay towards the
centre of the island, I found there was plenty of goats, though
exceeding shy, and hard to come at. However, I resolved to
try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them down.
Jan. 2.—Accordingly, the next day, I went out with my dog,
and set him upon the goats; but I was mistaken, for they all
faced about upon the dog; and he knew his danger too well, for
he would not come near them.
Jan. 3.—I began my fence or wall; which, being still jealous
of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very
thick and strong.
N.B.—This wall being described before, I purposely omit
what was said in the journal. It is sufficient to observe that I
was no less time than from the 3rd of January to the I4th of
April working, finishing, and perfecting this wall, though it was
no more than about twenty-four yards in length, being a half
circle from one place in the rock to another place about eight
yards from it, the door of the cave being in the centre
behind it.
All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me
many days, nay, sometimes weeks together; but I thought I
should never be perfectly secure till this wall was finished.
And it is scarce credible what inexpressible labour everything
was done with, especially the bringing piles out of the woods,
and driving them into the ground; for I made them much
bigger than I need to have done.
When this wall was finished, and the outside double-fenced
with a turf-wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that if
any people were to come on shore there, they would not per-
ceive anything like a habitation; and it was very well I did so,
as may be observed hereafter upon a very remarkable occasion.
During this time, I made my rounds in the woods for game
every day, when the rain admitted me, and made frequent dis-
coveries in these walks of something or other to my advantage;
particularly I found a kind of wild pigeons, who built, not as
wood pigeons in a tree, but rather as house pigeons, in the
holes of the rocks. And taking some young ones, I endeavoured
to breed them up tame, and did so; but when they grew older
they flew all away, which, perhaps, was at first for want of
feeding them, for I had nothing to give them. However, I
frequently found their nests, and got their young ones, which
were very good meat.
And now in the managing my household affairs I found
myself wanting in many things, which I thought at first it was
impossible for me to make, as indeed, as to some of them, it
was. For instance, I could never make a cask to be hooped;
I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before, but I could
never arrive to the capacity of making one by them, though I
spent many weeks about it. I could neither put in the heads,
or joint the staves so true to one another, as to make them hold
water; so I gave that also over.
In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle; so that
as soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by 'seven
o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump
of beeswax with which I made candles in my African ad-
venture, but I had none of that now. The only remedy I had
was, that when I had killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with
a little dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which 1
added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this
gave me light, though not a clear steady light like a candle.
In the middle of all my labours it happened, that rummag-
ing my things, I found a little bag, which, as I hinted before,
had been filled with corn for the feeding of poultry, not for this
voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship came from
Lisbon. What little remainder of corn had been in the bag
was all devoured with the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag
but husks and dust; and being willing to have the bag for some
other use, I think it was to put powder in, when I divided it for
fear of the lightning, or some such use, I shook the husks of
corn out of it on one side of my fortification, under the rock.
It was a little before the great rains, just now mentioned, that
I threw this stuff away, taking no notice of anything, and not
so much as remembering that I had thrown anything there;
when, about a month after, or thereabout, I saw some few stalks
of something green shooting out of the ground, which I fancied
might be some plant I had not seen; but I was surprised, and
perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer time, I saw about
ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect green barley of
the same kind as our European, nay, as our English barley.
I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in
their season, which was about the end of June; and laying up
every corn, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping in time to
have some quantity sufficient to supply me with bread. But it
was not till the fourth year that I could allow myself the least
grain of this corn to eat, and even then but sparingly, as I shall
say afterwards in its order; for I lost all that I sowed the first
season, by not observing the proper time; for I sowed it just
before the dry season, so that it never came up at all, at least
not as it would have done; of which in its place.
Besides this barley, there was, as above, twenty or thirty
stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care, and whose
use was of the same kind, or to the same purpose, viz., to make
me bread, or rather food; for I found ways to cook it up with-
out baking, though I did that also after some time. But to
return to my journal.
I worked excessive hard these three or four months to get
my wall done; and the I4th of April I closed it up, contriving
to go into it, not by a door, but over the wall by a ladder, that
there might be no sign in the outside of my habitation.
April 16.—I finished the ladder, so I went up with the
ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it
down on the inside. This was a complete enclosure to me; for
within I had room enough, and nothing could come at me from
without, unless it could first mount my wall.
The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost
had all my labour overthrown at once, and myself killed. The
case was thus: As I was busy in the inside of it, behind my
tent, just in the entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted
with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for all on a
sudden I found the earth come crumbling down from the roof
of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over my head, and
two of the posts I had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful
manner. I was heartily scared, but thought nothing of what
was really the cause, only thinking that the top of my cave was
falling in, as some of it had done before; and for fear I should
be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder; and not thinking
myself safe there neither, I got over my wall for fear of the
pieces of the hill which I expected might roll down upon me.
I was no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground, but I
plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake; for the ground I stood
on shook three times at about eight minutes' distance, with
three such shocks, as would have overturned the strongest
building that could be supposed to have stood on the earth;
and a great piece of the top of a rock, which stood about half a
mile from me next the sea, fell down with such a terrible noise,
as I never heard in all my life. I perceived also the very sea
was put into violent motion by it; and I believe the shocks
were stronger under the water than on the island.
After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some
time, I began to take courage; and yet I had not heart enough
to go over my wall again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat
still upon the ground, greatly cast down and disconsolate, not
knowing what to do. All this while I had not the least serious
religious thought, nothing but the common, " Lord, have mercy
upon me!" and when it was over, that went away too.
While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy,
as if it would rain. Soon after that the wind rose by little and
little, so that in less than half-an-hour it blew a most dreadful
hurricane. The sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam
and froth; the shore was covered with the breach of the water;
the trees were torn up by the roots; and a terrible storm it
was: and this held about three hours, and then began to
abate; and in two hours more it was stark calm, and began to
rain very hard.
I was forced to go into my cave, though very much afraid
and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz., to cut a
hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to let the water
go out, which would else have drowned my cave. After I had
been in my cave some time, and found still no more shocks of
the earthquake follow, I began to be more composed. And
now to support my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much,
I went to my little store, and took a small sup of rum, which
however, I did then, and always, very sparingly, knowing I
could have no more when that was gone.
It continued raining all that night and great part of the
next day, so that I could not stir abroad; but my mind being
more composed, I began to think of what I had best do, con-
cluding that if the island was subject to these earthquakes,
there would be no living for me in a cave, but I must consider
of building me some little hut in an open place, which I might
surround with a wall, as I had done here, and so make myself
secure from wild beasts or men; but concluded, if I stayed
where I was, I should certainly, one time or other, be buried
alive.
With these thoughts I resolved to remove my tent from the
place where it stood, which was just under the hanging precipice
of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken again, would
certainly fall upon my tent; and I spent the two next days,
being the igth and 2Oth of April, in contriving where and how
to remove my habitation.
The fear of being swallowed up alive made me that I never
slept in quiet; and yet the apprehension of lying abroad without
any fence was almost equal to it. But still, when I looked
about and saw how everything was put in order, how pleasantly
concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it made me very
loth to remove.
In the meantime it occurred to me that it would require a
vast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented
to run the venture where I was, till I had formed a camp for
myself, and had secured it so as to remove to it. So with this
resolution I composed myself for a time, and resolved that I
would go to work with all speed to build me a wall with piles
and cables, &c., in a circle as before, and set my tent up in it
when it was finished, but that I would venture to stay where
I was till it was finished, and fit to remove to. This was
the 21 st.
April 22.—The next morning I began to consider of means
to put this resolve in execution; but I was at a great loss about
my tools. I had three large axes, and abundance of hatchets
(for we carried the hatchets for traffic with the Indians), but
with much chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they were
all full of notches and dull; and though I had a grindstone, I
could not turn it and grind my tools too. This cost me as
much thought as a
statesman would have
bestowed upon a
grand pointof politics,
or a judge upon the
life and death of a
man. At length I
contrived a wheel
with a string, to turn
it with my foot, that
I might have both
my hands at liberty.
Note, I had never
seen any such thing
in England, or at least
not to take notice how
it was done, though
since I have observed
it is very common
there; besides that,
my grindstone was
very large and heavy.
This machine cost me
a full week's work to
bring it to perfection.
April 28, 29. —
These two whole
days I took up in
grinding my tools,
my machine for turn-
ing my grindstone
performing very well.
May I.—In the morning, looking towards the seaside, the
tide being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than
ordinary, and it looked like a cask. When I came to it, I found
a small barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship,
which were driven on shore by the late hurricane; and looking

Mv MACHINE FOR TURNING MY GRINDSTONE
PERFORMING VERY WELL.
towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out
of the water than it used to do. I examined the barrel which
was driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gun-
powder; but it had taken water, and the powder was caked as
hard as a stone. However, I rolled it farther on shore for the
present, and went on upon the sands as near as I could to the
wreck of the ship to look for more.
When I came down to the ship I found it strangely removed.
The forecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up
at least six feet; and the stern, which was broken to pieces,
and parted from the rest by the force of the sea, soon after I
had left rummaging her, was tossed, as it were, up, and cast on
one side, and the sand was thrown so high on that side next
her stern, that whereas there was a great place of water before,
so that I could not come within a quarter of a mile of the
wreck without swimming, I could now walk quite up to her
when the tide was out. I was surprised with this at first, but
soon concluded it must be done by the earthquake. And as by
this violence the ship was more broken open than formerly, so
many things came daily on shore, which the sea had loosened,
and which the winds and water rolled by degrees to the
land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of re-
moving my habitation; and I busied myself mightily, that day
especially, in searching whether I could make any way into
the ship. But I found nothing was to be expected of that kind,
for that all the inside of the ship was choked up with sand.
However, as I had learned not to despair of anything, I resolved
to pull everything to pieces that I could of the ship, concluding,
that everything I could get from her would be of some use or
other to me.
May 3-17.—Went every day to the wreck, and got a great
deal of pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and two or three
hundredweight of iron.
May 24.—Every day to this day I worked on the wreck,
and with hard labour I loosened some things so much with the
crow, that the first blowing tide several casks floated out, and
two of the seamen's chests. But the wind blowing from the
shore, nothing came to land that day but pieces of timber, and

I FOUND A LASGB TORTOISE OR TURTLE.
a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it, but the salt water
and the sand had spoiled it.
I continued this work every day to the I5th of June, except
the time necessary to get food, which I always appointed,
during this part of my employment, to be when the tide was
up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed out. And by this
time I had gotten timber, and plank, and ironwork enough to
have builded a good boat, if I had known how; and also, I got
at several times, and in several pieces, near one hundredweight
of the sheet lead.
June 16.—Going down to the seaside, I found a large
tortoise, or turtle. This was the first I had seen, which it seems
was only my misfortune, not any defect of the place, or scarcity;
for had I happened to be on the other side of the island, I
might have had hundreds of them every day, as I found
afterwards; but, perhaps, had paid dear enough for them.
June 17 I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her three-
score eggs; and her flesh was to me, at that time, the most
savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having had
no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I landed in this horrid place.
June 18.—Rained all day, and I stayed within. I thought
at this time the rain felt cold, and I was something chilly,
which I knew was not usual in that latitude.
June 19.—Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had been
cold.
June 20.—No rest all night; violent pains in my head, and
feverish.
June 21.—Very ill, frighted almost to death with the appre-
hensions of my sad condition, to be sick, and no help. Prayed
to God for the first time since the storm off Hull, but scarce
knew what I said, or why; my thoughts being all confused.
June 22.—A little better, but under dreadful apprehensions
of sickness.
June 23.—Very bad again; cold and shivering, and then a
violent headache.
June 24.—Much better.
June 25.—An ague very violent; the fit held me seven
hours; cold fit, and hot, with faint sweats after it.
June 26.—Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my
gun, but found myself very weak. However, I killed a she-goat,
and with much difficulty got it home, and broiled some of it,
and eat. I would fain have stewed it, and made some broth,
but had no pot.
June 27.—The ague again so violent that I lay abed all day,
and neither eat or drink. I was ready to perish for thirst; but
so weak, I had not strength to stand up, or to get myself any
water to drink. Prayed to God again, but was light-headed;
and when I was not, I was so ignorant that I knew not what to
say; only I lay and cried, "Lord, look upon me! Lord, pity
me! Lord, have mercy upon me!" I suppose I did nothing
else for two or three hours, till the fit wearing off, I fell asleep,
and did not wake till far in the night. When I waked, I
found myself much refreshed, but weak, and exceeding thirsty.
However, as I had no water in my whole habitation, I was
forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep again. In this
second sleep I had this terrible dream.
I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside
of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew after the earth-
quake, and that I saw a man descend from a great black cloud,
E
in a bright flame of fire, and light upon the ground. He was
all over as bright as a flame, so that I could but just bear to
look towards him. His countenance was most inexpressibly
dreadful, impossible for words to describe. When he stepped
upon the ground with his feet, I thought the earth trembled,
just as it had done before in the earthquake, and all the air
looked, to my apprehension, as if it had been filled with flashes
of fire.
He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved
forward towards me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand, to
kill me; and when he came to a rising ground, at some distance,
he spoke to me, or I heard a voice so terrible, that it is im-
possible to express the terror of it. All that I can say I under-
stood was this: "Seeing all these things have not brought
thee to repentance, now thou shalt die;" at which words I
thought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand to kill me.
No one that shall ever read this account, will expect that I
should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible
vision; I mean, that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed
of those horrors; nor is it any more possible to describe the
impression that remained upon my mind when I awaked, and
found it was but a dream.
I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had received by
the good instruction of my father was then worn out, by an
uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafaring wickedness,
and a constant conversation with nothing but such as were, like
myself, wicked and profane to the last degree. I do not re-
member that I had, in all that time, one thought that so much
as tended either to looking upwards toward God, or inwards
towards a reflection upon my ways.
It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my
ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised with a
kind of ecstasy, and some transports of soul, which, had the
grace of God assisted, might have come up to true thankfulness;
but it ended where it begun, in a mere common flight of joy, or,
as I may say, being glad I was alive, without the least re-
flection upon the distinguishing goodness of the hand which
had preserved me, and had singled me out to be preserved,
when all the rest were destroyed; or an inquiry why Providence
had been thus merciful to me; even just the same common sort
of joy which seamen generally have after they are got safe
ashore from a shipwreck, which they drown all in the next bowl
of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over, and all the rest
of my life was like it.
Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more terrible in
its nature, or more immediately directing to the invisible Power,
which alone directs such things, yet no sooner was the first fright
over, but the impression it had made went off also. I had no
more sense of God or His judgments, much less of the present
affliction of my circumstances being from His hand, than if I
had been in the most prosperous condition of life.
But now, when I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of
the miseries of death came to place itself before me; when my
spirits began to sink under the burthen of a strong distemper,
and Nature was exhausted with the violence of the fever; con-
science, that had slept so long, began to awake, and I began to
reproach myself with my past life, in which I had so evidently,
by uncommon wickedness, provoked the justice of God to lay
me under uncommon strokes, and to deal with me in so vindic-
tive a manner.
"Now," said I aloud, "my dear father's words are come to
pass; God's justice has overtaken me, and I have none to help
or hear me. I rejected the voice of Providence, which had mer-
cifully put me in a posture or station of life wherein I might
have been happy and easy; but I would neither see it myself,
or learn to know the blessing of it from my parents. I refused
their help and assistance, who would have lifted me into the
world, and would have made everything easy to me; and now I
have difficulties to struggle with, too great for even Nature
itself to support, and no assistance, no help, no comfort, no
advice." Then I cried out, " Lord, be my help, for I am in
great distress."
This was the first prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made
for many years. But I return to my journal.
June 28.—Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I
had had, and the fit being entirely off, I got up; and though
the fright and terror of my dream was very great, yet I con-
sidered that the fit of the ague would return again the next day,
and now was my time to get something to refresh and support
myself when I should be ill. And the first thing I did I filled a
large square case-bottle with water, and set it upon my table,
in reach of my bed; and to take off the chill or aguish disposi-
tion of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it,
and mixed them together. Then I got me a piece of the goat's
flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very little. I
walked about, but was very weak, and withal very sad and
heavy-hearted in the sense of my miserable condition, dreading
the return of my distemper the next day. At night I made my
supper of three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes,
and eat, as we call it, in the shell; and this was the first bit of
meat I had ever asked God's blessing to, even as I could
remember, in my whole life.
After I had eaten, I tried to walk, but found myself so weak,
that I could hardly carry the gun (for I never went out without
that); so I went but a little way, and sat down upon the
ground, looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and
very calm and smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as
these occurred to me.
That it must needs be that God had appointed all this to
befall me; that I was brought to this miserable circumstance
by His direction, He having the sole power, not of me only, but
of everything that happened in the world. Immediately it
followed, Why has God done this to me? What hare I done
to be thus used?
My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I
had blasphemed, and methought it spoke to me like a voice:
"Wretch! dost thou ask what thou hast done? Look back
upon a dreadful misspent life, and ask thyself what thou hast
not done? Ask, why is it that thou wert not long ago de-
stroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads;
killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the Sallee man-
of-war; devoured by the wild beast on the coast of Africa?
or drowned here, when all the crew perished but thyself? Dost
thou ask, What have I done?"
I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one astonished,
and had not a word to say, no, not to answer to myself, but rose
up pensive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went up
over my wall, as if I had been going to bed. But my thoughts
were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I
sat down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be
dark. Now, as the apprehension of the return of my distemper
terrified me very much, it occurred to my thought that the
Brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all dis-
tempers; and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the
chests, which was quite cured, and some also that was green,
and not quite cured.
I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this chest I
found a cure both for soul and body. I opened the chest, and
found what I looked for, viz., the tobacco; and as the few books
I had saved lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I
mentioned before, and which to this time I had not found
leisure, or so much as inclination, to look into. I say, I took it
out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the table.
What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to my dis-
temper, or whether it was good for it or no; but I tried several
experiments with it, as if I was resolved it should hit one way
or other. I first took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my
mouth, which indeed at first almost stupefied my brain, the
tobacco being green and strong, and that I had not been much
used to it. Then I took some and steeped it an hour or two in
some rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down.
And lastly, I burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose
close over the smoke of it as long as I could bear it, as well for
the heat, as almost for suffocation.
In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible, and
began to read, but my head was too much disturbed with the
tobacco to bear reading, at least that time; only having opened
the book casually, the first words that occurred to me were
these, " Call on Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver, and
thou shalt glorify Me."
It grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my
head so much, that I inclined to sleep; so I left my lamp burn-
ing in the cave, lest I should want anything in the night, and
went to bed. But before I lay down, I did what I never had
done in all my life; I kneeled down, and prayed to God to
fulfil the promise to me, that if I called upon Him in the day of
trouble, He would deliver me. After my broken and imperfect
prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had steeped the
tobacco; which was so strong and rank of the tobacco, that in-
deed I could scarce get it down. Immediately upon this I went
to bed. I found presently it flew up in my head violently; but
I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more till, by the sun, it
must necessarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon the next
day. Nay, to this hour I am partly of the opinion that I slept
all the next day and night, and till almost three that day after;
for otherwise I knew not how I should lose a day out of my
reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared some years
after I had done. For if I had lost it by crossing and recross-
ing the line, I should have lost more than one day. But cer-
tainly I lost a day in my account, and never knew which way.
Be that, however, one way or the other, when I awaked I
found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and
cheerful. When I got up, I was stronger than I was the day
before, and my stomach better, for I was hungry; and, in short,
I had no fit the next day, but continued much altered for the
better. This was the 29th.
The 3Oth was my well day, of course, and I went abroad
with my gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a sea-
fowl or two, something like a brand-goose, and brought them
home, but was not very forward to eat them ; so I eat some
more of the turtle's eggs, which were very good. This evening
I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me good the
day before, viz., the tobacco steeped in rum ; only I did not
take so much as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold
my head over the smoke. However, I was not so well the next
day, which was the first of July, as I hoped I should have been;
for I had a little spice of the cold fit, but it was not much.
July 4.—In the morning I took the Bible; and beginning at
the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and imposed
upon myself to read awhile every morning and every night, not
tying myself to the number of chapters, but as long as my
thoughts should engage me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, " Call
on Me, and I will deliver you," in a different sense from what I
had ever done before; for then I had no notion of anything
being called deliverance but my being delivered from the cap-
tivity I was in; for though I was indeed at large in the place,
yet the island was certainly a prison to me, and that in the
worst sense in the world. But now I learned to take it in
another sense; now I looked back upon my past life with such
horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought
nothing of God but deliverance from the load of guilt that bore
down all my comfort.
My condition began now to be, though not less miserable as
to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind; and my
thoughts being directed, by a constant reading the Scripture,
and praying to God, to things of a higher nature, I had a great
deal of comfort within, which, till now, I knew nothing of.
Also, as my health and strength returned, I bestirred myself to
furnish myself with everything that I wanted, and make my
way of living as regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the I4th, I was chiefly employed
in walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little
at a time, as a man that was gathering up his strength after a
fit of sickness; for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was,
and to what weakness I was reduced. The application which I
made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps what had never
cured an ague before; neither can I recommend it to any one
to practise, by this experiment; and though it did carry off the
fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening me; for I had frequent
convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time.
I had been now in this unhappy island above ten months;
all possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be
entirely taken from me; and I firmly believed that no human
shape had ever set foot upon that place. Having now secured
my habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great
desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island, and to
see what other productions I might find, which I yet knew
nothing of.
It was the iSth of July that I began to take a more
particular survey of the island itself. I went up the creek first,
where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found, after
I came about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any
higher, and that it was no more than a little brook of running
water, and very fresh and good; but this being the dry
season, there was hardly any water in some parts of it,
at least, not enough to run in any stream, so as it could be
perceived.
On the bank of this brook I found many pleasant savannas
or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass; and on the
rising parts of them, next to the higher grounds, where the water,
as might be supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal
of tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very strong stalk.
There were divers other plants, which I had no notion of, or
understanding about, and might perhaps have virtues of their
own which I could not find out.
I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that
climate, make their bread of, but I could find none. I saw large
plants of aloes, but did not then understand them. I saw
several sugar-canes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation,
imperfect. I contented myself with these discoveries for this
time, and came back, musing with myself what course I might
take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or
plants which I should discover; but could bring it to no con-
clusion; for, in short, I had made so little observation while I
was in the Brazils, that I knew little of the plants in the field, at
least very little that might serve me to any purpose now in my
distress.
The next day, the i6th, I went up the same way again; and
after going something farther than I had gone the day before, I
found the brook and the savannas began to cease, and the
country became more woody than before. In this part I found
different fruits, and particularly I found melons upon the ground
in great abundance, and grapes upon the trees. The vines had
spread indeed over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were
just now in their prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surpris-
ing discovery, and 1 was exceeding glad of them; but I was
warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them, remembering
that when I was ashore in Barbary the eating of grapes killed
several of our Englishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing
them into fluxes and fevers. But I found an excellent use for
these grapes; and that was, to cure or dry them in the sun, and
keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought
j$
"I WAS KING AND LORD OF ALL THIS COUNTRY
would be, as indeed they were, as wholesome as agreeable to eat,
when no grapes might be to be had.
I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my
habitation; which, by the way, was the first night, as I might
say, I had lain from home. In the night, I took my first
contrivance, and got up into a tree, where I slept well; and the
next morning proceeded upon my discovery, travelling near four
miles, as I might judge by the length of the valley, keeping still
due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and north side
of me.
At the end of this march I came to an opening, where the
country seemed to descend to the west; and a little spring of
fresh water, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran
the other way, that is, due east; and the country appeared so
fresh, so green, so flourishing, everything being in a constant
verdure or flourish of spring, that it looked like a planted garden.
I descended a little on the side of that delicious vale, survey-
ing it with a secret kind of pleasure, though mixed with my
other afflicting thoughts, to think that this was all my own;
that I was king and lord of all this country indefeasibly, and
had a right of possession; and, if I could convey it, I might have
it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in England.
I saw here abundance of cocoa trees, orange, and lemon, and
citron trees; but all wild, and very few bearing any fruit, at
least not then. However, the green limes that I gathered were
not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed
their juice afterwards with water, which made it very wholesome,
and very cool and refreshing.
I found now I had business enough to gather and carry
home; and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as
limes and lemons to furnish myself for the wet season, which I
knew was approaching.
In order to this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one
place, and a lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of
limes and lemons in another place; and, taking a few of each
with me, I travelled homeward; and resolved to come again,
and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest
home.
Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I came
home (so I must now call my tent and my cave); but before I
got thither, the grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruits,
and the weight of the juice, having broken them and bruised
them, they were good for little or nothing: as to the limes,
they were good, but I could bring but a few.
The next day, being the igth, I went back, having made me
two small bags to bring home my harvest; but I was surprised,
when, coming to my heap of grapes, which were so rich and
fine when I gathered them, I found them all spread about, trod
to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some there, and abund-
ance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded there were some
wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but what they
were, I knew not.
However, as I found that there was no laying them up on
heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way
they would be destroyed, and the other way they would be
crushed with their own weight, I took another course; for I
gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and hung them up upon
the out-branches of the trees, that they might cure and dry in
the sun; and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many back
as I could well stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with
great pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasant-
ness of the situation; the security from storms on that side the
water and the wood; and concluded that I had pitched upon a
place to fix my abode, which was by far the worst part of the
country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of removing my
habitation, and to look out for a place equally safe as where I
now was situate, if possible, in that pleasant fruitful part of the
island.
This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding
fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting
me; but when I came to a nearer view of it, and to consider
that I was now by the seaside, where it was at least possible
that something might happen to my advantage, and, by the same
ill fate that brought me hither, might bring some other unhappy
wretches to the same place; and though it was scarce probable
that any such thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself
among the hills and woods in the centre of the island, was to
anticipate my bondage, and to render such an affair not only
improbable, but impossible; and that therefore I ought not by
any means to remove.
However, I was so enamoured of this place, that I spent
much of my time there for the whole remaining part of the
month of July; and though, upon second thoughts, I resolved,
as above, not to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower,
and surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence, being a
double hedge as high as I could reach, well staked, and filled
between with brushwood. And here I lay very secure, some-
times two or three nights together, always going over it with a
ladder, as before; so that I fancied now I had my country house
and my sea-coast house; and this work took me up to the
beginning of August.
I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my
labour, but the rains came on, and made me stick close to my
first habitation; for though I had made me a tent like the other,
with a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the
shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me
to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary.
About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my
bower, and began to enjoy myself. The 3rd of August, I
found the grapes I had hung up were perfectly dried, and in-
deed were excellent good raisins of the sun ; so I began to take
them down from the trees. And it was very happy that I did
so, for the rains which followed would have spoiled them, and
I had lost the best part of my winter food; for I had above two
hundred large bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them
all down, and carried most of them home to my cave, but it began
to rain ; and from hence, which was the I4th of August, it rained,
more or less, every day till the middle of October, and sometimes
so violently, that I could not stir out of my cave for several
days.
In this season, I was much surprised with the increase of
my family. I had been concerned for the loss of one of my
cats, who run away from me, or, as I thought, had been dead,
and I heard no more tale or tidings of her, till, to my astonish-
ment, she came home about the end of August with three
kittens. But from these three cats I afterwards came to be so
pestered with cats, that I was forced to kill them like vermin,
or wild beasts, and to drive them from my house as much as
possible.
From the I4th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so
that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to be much
wet. In this confinement, I began to be straitened for food;
but venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat, and the last
day, which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which was
a treat to me, and my food was regulated thus: I eat a bunch of
raisins for my breakfast, a piece of the goat's flesh, or of the
turtle, for my dinner, broiled; for, to my great misfortune, I
had no vessel to boil or stew anything; and two or three of the
turtle's eggs for my supper.
During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked
daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees
worked it on towards one side, till I came to the outside of the
hill, and made a door, or way out, which came beyond my fence
or wall; and so I came in and out this way. But I was not
perfectly easy at lying so open; for as I had managed myself
before, I was in a perfect enclosure; whereas now, I thought I
lay exposed, and open for anything to come in upon me; and
yet I could not perceive that there was any living thing to fear,
the biggest creature that I had yet seen upon the island being
a goat.
Sept. 30.—I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of
my landing. I cast up the notches on my post, and found I
had been on shore three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept
this day as a solemn fast, setting it apart to religious exercise.
I had all this time observed no Sabbath day, for as at first
I had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time,
omitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch
than ordinary for the Sabbath day, and so did not really know
what any of the days were. But now, having cast up the days,
as above, I found I had been there a year, so I divided it into
weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a Sabbath; though
I found at the end of my account, I had lost a day or two in
my reckoning.
A little after this my ink began to fail me, and so I con-
tented myself to use it more sparingly, and to write down only
the most remarkable events of my life, without continuing a
daily memorandum of other things.
The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear
regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide
for them accordingly; but I bought all my experience before I
had it, and this I am going to relate was one of the most dis-
couraging experiments that I made at all. I have mentioned
that I had saved the few ears of barley and rice, which I had so
surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and
believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty
of barley; and now I thought it a proper time to sow it after
the rains, the sun being in its southern position, going from
me.
Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground as well as I could
with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed
my grain; but as I was sowing, it casually occurred to my
thoughts that I would not sow it all at first, because I did not
know when was the proper time for it, so I sowed about two-
thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of each.
It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for
not one grain of that I sowed this time came to anything, for
the dry months following, the earth having had no rain after
the seed was sown, it had no moisture to assist its growth, and
never came up at all till the wet season had come again, and
then it grew as if it had been but newly sown.
Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister piece of
ground to make another trial in, and I dug up a piece of ground
near my new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February,
a little before the vernal equinox. And this having the rainy
months of March and April to water it, sprung up very
pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but having part of
the seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had, I had
but a small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to
above half a peck of each kind. But by this experiment I was
made master of my business, and knew exactly when the
proper season was to sow, and that I might expect two seed-
times and two harvests every year.
While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery,
which was of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were
over, and the weather began to settle, which was about the
month of November, I made a visit up the country to my
bower, where, though I had not been some months, yet I found
all things just as I left them. The circle or double hedge that
I had made was not only firm and entire, but the stakes which
I had cut out of some trees that grew therabouts were all shot
out, and grown with long branches, as much as a willow-tree
usually shoots the first year after lopping its head. I could
not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut from. I
was surprised, and yet very well pleased to see the young trees
grow, and I pruned them, and led them up to grow as much
alike as I could. And it is scarce credible how beautiful a
figure they grew into in three years; so that though the hedge
made a circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the
trees, for such I might now call them, soon covered it, and it
was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry
season.
This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make
me a hedge like this, in a semicircle round my wall (I mean
that of my first dwelling), which I did; and placing the trees or
stakes in a double row, at about eight yards' distance from my
first fence, they grew presently, and were at first a fine cover
to my habitation, and afterward served for a defence also, as I
shall observe in its order.
I found now that the seasons of the year might generally
be divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into
the rainy seasons and the dry seasons. After I had found by
experience the ill consequence of being abroad in the rain, I
took care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I
might not be obliged to go out; and I sat within doors as much
as possible during the wet months.
In this time I found much employment, and very suitable
also to the time, for I found great occasion of many things
which I had no way to furnish myself with but by hard labour
and constant application; particularly, I tried many ways to
make myself a basket; but all the twigs I could get for the
purpose proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It
proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was a
boy I used to take great delight in standing at a basket-maker's
in the town where my father lived, to see them make their
wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very officious to
help, and a great observer of the manner how they worked
those things, and sometimes lending a hand, I had by this means
full knowledge of the methods of it, that I wanted nothing but
the materials; when it came into my mind that the twigs of
that tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew might possibly
be as tough as the sallows, and willows, and osiers in England,
and I resolved to try.
Accordingly, the next day, I went to my country house, as
I called it; and cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them
to my purpose as much as I could desire; whereupon I came
the next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity,
which I soon found, for there was great plenty of them. These
I set up to dry within my circle or hedge, and when they were
fit for use, I carried them to my cave ; and here during the next
season I employed myself in making, as well as I could, a great
many baskets, both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up any-
thing as I had occasion. And though I did not finish them
very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for
my purpose. And thus, afterwards, I took care never to be
without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed, I made more,
especially I made strong deep baskets to place my corn in,
instead of sacks, when I should come to have any quantity
of it.
Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of
time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to
supply two wants. I had no vessels to hold anything that was
liquid, except two runlets, which were almost full of rum, and
some glass bottles, some of the common size, and others which
were case-bottles square, for the holding of waters, spirits, &c.
I had not so much as a pot to boil anything, except a great
kettle, which I saved out of the ship, and which was too big for
such use as I desired it, viz., to make broth, and stew a bit of
meat by itself. The second thing I would fain have had was a
tobacco-pipe; but it was impossible to me to make one. How-
ever, I found a contrivance for that, too, at last.
I employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes or
piles and in this wicker-working all the summer or dry season,
when another business took me up more time than it could be
imagined I could spare.
I mentioned before that I had a great mind to see the whole
island, and that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to
where I built my bower, and where I had an opening quite to
the sea, on the other side of the island. I now resolved to
travel quite across to the seashore on that side; so taking my
gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of powder
and shot than usual, with two biscuit-cakes and a great bunch
of raisins in my pouch for my store, I began my journey.
When I had passed the vale where my bower stood, as above, I
came within view of the sea to the west; and it being a very
clear day, I fairly descried land, whether an island or a
continent I could not tell; but it lay very high, extending from
the west to the W.S.W. at a very great distance; by my guess,
it could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.
I saw abundance of parrots, and fain I would have caught
one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to
speak to me. I did, after some painstaking, catch a young
parrot, for I knocked it down with a stick, and having recovered
it, I brought it home; but it was some years before I could
make him speak. However, at last I taught him to call me by
my name very familiarly. But the accident that followed,
though it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in
the low grounds hares, as I thought them to be, and foxes; but
they differed greatly from all the other kinds I had met with,
nor could I satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed several.
But I had no need to be venturous, for I had no want of food,
and of that which was very good too; especially these three
sorts, viz., goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise; which, added
to my grapes, Leadenhall Market could not have furnished a
table better than I, in proportion to the company. And though
my case was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for thank-
fulness, and that I was not driven to any extremities for food,
but rather plenty, even to dainties.
I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in
a day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns and returns,
to see what discoveries I could make, that I came weary enough
to the place where I resolved to sit down for all night; and
then I either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded myself
with a row of stakes, set upright in the ground, either from one
tree to another, or so as no wild creature could come at me
without waking me.
As soon as I came to the seashore, I was surprised to see
that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island, for
here indeed the shore was covered with innumerable turtles;
whereas, on the other side, I had found but three in a year and
a half. Here was also an infinite number of fowls of many
kinds, some which I had seen, and some which I had not seen
of before, and many of them very good meat, but such as I
knew not the names of, except those called penguins.
I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing
of my powder and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill a
she-goat, if I could, which I could better feed on; and though
there were many goats here, more than on my side the island,
yet it was with much more difficulty that I could come near
them, the country being flat and even, and they saw me much
sooner than when I was on the hill.
I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than
mine; but yet I had not the least inclination to remove, for as
I was fixed in my habitation, it became natural to me, and I
seemed all the while I was here to be as it were upon a journey,
and from home. However, I travelled along the shore of the
sea towards the east, I suppose about twelve miles, and then
setting up a great pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded
I would go home again; and that the next journey I took
should be on the other side of the island, east from my dwelling,
and so round till I came to my post again; of which in its
place.
I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking
I could easily keep all the island so much in my view, that I
could not miss finding my first dwelling by viewing the country.
But I found myself mistaken. T wandered about very uncom-
fortably, and at last was obliged to find out the seaside, look
for my post, and come back the same way I went; and then by
easy journeys I turned homeward, the weather being exceeding
hot, and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things very
heavy.
In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized
upon it, and I running in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved
it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it home if I
could, for I had often been musing whether it might not be
possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats,
which might supply me when my powder and shot should be
all spent.
I made a collar to this little creature, and with a string,
which I made of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about
me, I led him along, though with some difficulty, till I came to
my bower, and there I enclosed him and left him, for I was very
impatient to be at home, from whence I had been absent
above a month.
I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come
into my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed. This
little wandering journey, without settled place of abode, had
been so unpleasant to me, that my own house, as I called it to
myself, was a perfect settlement to me compared to that; and
it rendered everything about me so comfortable, that I resolved
I would never go a great way from it again, while it should be
my lot to stay on the island.
I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself
after my long journey; during which most of the time was
taken up in the weighty affair of making a cage for my Poll,
who began now to be a mere domestic, and to be mighty well
acquainted with me. Then I began to think of the poor kid
which I had penned in within my little circle, and resolved to
go and fetch it home, or give it some food. Accordingly I
went, and found it where I left it, for indeed it could not get
out, but almost starved for want of food. I went and cut
boughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I could find,
and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I did before, to
lead it away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I had
no need to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog. And as
I continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so gentle,
and so fond, that it became from that time one of my domestics
also, and would never leave me afterwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come,
and I kept the 3Oth of September in the same solemn manner
as before, being the anniversary of my landing on the island,
having now been there two years, and no more prospect of
being delivered than the first day I came there. I spent the
whole day in humble and thankful acknowledgments of the
many wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was
attended with, and without which it might have been infinitely
more miserable.
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more
happy this life I now led was, with all its miserable circum-
stances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the
past part of my days. And now I changed both my sorrows
and my joys; my very desires altered, my affections changed
their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new from what they
were at my first coming, or indeed for the two years past.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third
year; and though I have not given the reader the trouble of so
particular account of my works this year as the first, yet in
general it may be observed, that I was very seldom idle, but
having regularly divided my time, according to the several
daily employments that were before me, such as, first, my duty
to God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set
apart some time for, thrice every day; secondly, the going
abroad with my gun for food, which generally took me up three
hours in every morning, when it did not rain; thirdly, the
ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed or
catched for my supply; these took up great part of the day;
also, it is to be considered that the middle of the day, when the
sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too great to
stir out; so that about four hours in the evening was all the
time I could be supposed to work in, with this exception, that
sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and working, and
went to work in the morning, and abroad with my gun in the
afternoon.
To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may be added
the exceeding laboriousness of my work; the many hours which,
for want of tools, want of help, and want of skill, everything I
did took up out of my time. For example, I was full two and
forty days making me a board for a long shelf, which I wanted
in my cave; whereas two sawyers, with their tools and a saw-
pit, would have cut six of them out of the same tree in half a
day.
My case was this: it was to be a large tree which was to be
cut down, because my board was to be a broad one. This tree
I was three days a-cutting down, and two more cutting off the
boughs, and reducing it to a1 log, or piece of timber. With
inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it
into chips till it began to be light enough to move; then I
turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board
from end to end; then turning that side downward, cut the
other side, till I brought the plank to be about three inches
thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one may judge the labour
of my hands in such a piece of work; but labour and patience
carried me through that, and many other things. I only observe
this in particular, to show the reason why so much of my time
went away with so little work, viz., that what might be a little to
be done with help and tools, was a vast labour, and required a
prodigious time to do alone, and by hand. But notwithstanding
this, with patience and labour, I went through many things, and,
indeed, everything that my circumstances made necessary to me
to do, as will appear by what follows.
I was now, in the months of November and December, ex-
pecting my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had manured
or dug up for them was not great; for as I observed, my seed of
each was not above the quantity of half a peck; for I had lost
one whole crop by sowing in the dry season. But now my crop
promised very well, when on a sudden I found I was in danger of
losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, which it was
scarce possible to keep from it; as, first the goats and wild
creatures which I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the
blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it came up, and eat it
so close, that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk.
This I saw no remedy for but by making an enclosure about
it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil, and the
more, because it required speed. However, as my arable land
was but small, suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced in
about three weeks' time, and shooting some of the creatures in
the daytime, I set my dog to guard it in the night, tying him up
to a stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark all night
long; so in a little time the enemies forsook the place, and the
corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the beasts ruined me before while my corn was in the
blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now when it was in
the ear; for going along by the place to see how it throve, I
saw my little crop surrounded with fowls, of I know not how
many sorts, who stood, as it were, watching till I should be gone.
I immediately let fly among them, for I always had my gun
with me. I had no sooner shot, but there rose up a little cloud
of fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the corn
itself.
This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days
they would devour all my hopes, that I should be starved, and
never be able to raise a crop at all, and what to do I could not
tell. However, I resolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though
I should watch it night and day. In the first place, I went
among it to see what damage was already done, and found they
had spoiled a good deal of it; but that as it was yet too green
for them, the loss was not so great but that the remainder was
like to be a good crop if it could be saved.
I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I
could easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me,
as if they only waited till I was gone away. And the event
proved it to be so; for as I walked off, as if I was gone, I was
no sooner out of their sight but they dropped down, one by one,
into the corn again. I was so provoked, that I could not have
patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every grain
that they eat now was, as it might be said, a peck-loaf to me in
the consequence; but coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and
killed three of them. This was what I wished for; so I took
them up, and served them as we serve notorious thieves in
England, viz., hanged them in chains, for a terror to others. It
is impossible to imagine almost that this should have such an
effect as it had, for the fowls would not only not come at the
corn, but, in short, they forsook all that part of the island, and
I could never see a bird near the place as long as my scare-
crows hung there.
This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and about the
latter end of December, which was our second harvest of the
year, I reaped my crop.
I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to cut it down,
and all I could do was to make one as well as I could out of one
of the broadswords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms
out of the ship. However, as my first crop was but small, I had
no great difficulty to cut it down; in short, I reaped it my way;
for I cut nothing off but the ears, and carried it away in a great
basket which I had made, and so rubbed it out with my hands;
and at the end of all my harvesting, I found that out of my half
peck of seed I had near two bushels of rice, and above two
bushels and a half of barley, that is to say, by my guess, for I
had no measure at that time.
However, this was a great encouragement to me, and I fore-
saw that, in time, it would please God to supply me with bread.
And yet here I was perplexed again, for I neither knew how to
grind or make meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean it and
part it; nor, if made into meal, how to make bread of it, and if
how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it. These things
being added to my desire of having a good quantity for store,
and to secure a constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of
this crop, but to preserve it all for seed against the next season,
and, in the meantime, to employ all my study and hours of
working to accomplish this great work of providing myself with
corn and bread.
Within doors, that is, when it rained, and I could not go out,
I found employment on the following occasions; always ob-
serving, that all the while I was at work, I diverted myself with
talking to my parrot, and teaching him to speak, and I quickly
learned him to know his own name, and at last to speak it out
pretty loud, " Poll," which was the first word I ever heard spoken
in the island by any mouth but my own. This, therefore, was
not my work, but an assistant to my work; for now, as I said,
I had a great employment upon my hands, as follows, viz., I had
long studied, by some means or other, to make myself some
earthen vessels, which indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not
where to come at them. However, considering the heat of the
climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any such clay,

WHAT ODD, MISSHAPEN, UGLY THINGS I MADE.
I might botch up some such pot as might, being dried in the
sun, be hard enough and strong enough to bear handling, and
to hold anything that was dry, and required to be kept so; and
as this was necessary in the preparing corn, meal, &c., which
was the thing I was upon, I resolved to make some as large as
I could, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold what should be
put into them.
It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to
tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this paste; what
odd, misshapen, ugly things I made; how many of them fell in,
and how many fell out, the clay not being stiff enough to bear
its own weight; how many cracked by the over-violent heat of
the sun, being set out too hastily ; and how many fell in pieces
with only removing, as well before as after they were dried; and,
in a word, how, after having laboured hard to find the clay, to
dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work it, I could not
make above two large earthern ugly things (I cannot call them
jars) in about two months' labour.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I
lifted them very gently up, and set them down again in two
great wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose for them
that they might not break ; and as between the pot and the
basket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed it full of the
rice and barley straw, and these two pots being to stand always
dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal,
when the corn was bruised.
Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots,
yet I made several smaller things with better success; such as
little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any things
my hand turned to; and the heat of the sun baked them
strangely hard. But all this would not answer my end, which
was to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the
fire, which none of these could do. It happened after some
time, making a pretty large fire for cooking my meat, when I
went to put it out after I had done with it, I found a broken
piece of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard
as a stone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see
it, and said to myself, that certainly they might be made to
burn whole, if they would burn broken.
This set me to studying how to order my fire, so as to make
it burn me some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the
potters burn in, or of glazing them with lead, though I had
some lead to do it with; but I placed three large pipkins, and
two or three pots in a pile, one upon another, and placed my
firewood all round it, with a great heap of embers under them.
I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and upon the
top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and
observed that they did not crack at all. When I saw them clear
red, I let them stand in that heat about five or six hours, till I
found one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run, for
the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by the violence
of the heat, and would have run into glass, if I had gone on; so
I slacked my fire gradually till the pots began to abate of the
red colour; and watching them all night, that I might not let
the fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three very good, I
will not say handsome, pipkins, and two other earthen pots, as
hard burnt as could be desired, and one of them perfectly glazed
with the running of the sand.
After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort
of earthenware for my use; but I must needs say, as to the
shapes of them, they were very indifferent, as anyone may sup-
pose, when I had no way of making them but as the children make
dirt pies, or as a woman would make pies that never learned to
raise paste.
No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to
mine, when I found I had made an earthen pot that would bear
the fire; and I had hardly patience to stay till they were cold,
before I set one upon the fire again, with some water in it, to
boil me some meat, which it did admirably well; and with a
piece of a kid I made some very good broth, though I wanted
oatmeal and several other ingredients requisite to make it so
good as I would have had it been.
My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or
beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there was no thought at
arriving to that perfection of art with one pair of hands. I
spent many a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut
hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could find none at all,
except what was in the solid rock, and which I had no way to
dig or cut out; nor indeed were the rocks in the island of
hardness sufficient, but were all of a sandy crumbling stone,
which neither would bear the weight of a heavy pestle, or would
break the corn without filling it with sand. So, after a great
deal of time lost in searching for a stone, I gave it over, and
resolved to look out for a great block of hard wood, which I found
indeed much easier; and getting one as big as I had strength to
stir, I rounded it, and formed it in the outside with my axe and
hatchet, and then, with the help of fire, and infinite labour, made
a hollow place in it, as the Indians in Brazil make their canoes.
After this, I made a great heavy pestle, or beater, of the wood
called the iron-wood; and this I prepared and laid by against
I had my next crop of corn, when I proposed to myself to grind,
or rather pound, my corn into meal, to make my bread.
My next difficulty was to make a sieve, or search, to dress
my meal, and to part it from the bran and the husk, without
which I did not see it possible I could have any bread. This
was a most difficult thing, so much as but to think on, for to be
sure I had nothing like the necessary thing to make it; I mean
fine thin canvas or stuff, to search the meal through. And here
I was at a full stop for many months, nor did I really know
what to do; linen I had none left, but what was mere rags; I
had goats'-hair, but neither knew I how to weave it or spin it;
and had I known how, here was no tools to work it with. All
the remedy that I found for this was, that at last I did remember
I had, among the seamen's clothes which were saved out of the
ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin; and with some pieces
of these I made three small sieves, but proper enough for the
work; and thus I made shift for some years. How I did after-
wards, I shall show in its place.
The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and
how I should make bread when I came to have corn; for, first,
I had no yeast. As to that part, as there was no supplying the
want, so I did not concern myself much about it; but for an
oven I was indeed in great pain. At length I found out an
experiment for that also, which was this: I made some earthen
vessels very broad, but not deep, that is to say, about two feet
diameter, and not above nine inches deep; these I burned in
the fire, as I had done the other, and laid them by; and when I
wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon my hearth, which I
had paved with some square tiles, of my own making and
burning also; but I should not call them square.
When the firewood was burned pretty much into embers, or
live coals, I drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover
it all over, and there I let them lie till the hearth was very hot;
then sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves,
and whelming down the earthen pot upon them, drew the
embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep in and add to
the heat. And thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I
baked my barley-loaves, and became, in little time, a mere
pastry-cook into the bargain; for I made myself several cakes
of the rice, and puddings; indeed I made no pies, neither had
I anything to put into them, supposing I had, except the flesh
either of fowls or goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all these things took me up
most part of the third year of my abode here; for it is to be
observed, that in the intervals of these things I had my new
harvest and husbandry to manage; for I reaped my corn in its
season, and carried it home as well as I could, and laid it up in
the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out, for I
had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with.
And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really
wanted to build my barns bigger. I wanted a place to lay it up
in, for the increase of the corn now yielded me so much, that I
had of the barley about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much,
or more, insomuch that now I resolved to begin to use it freely;
for my bread had been quite gone a great while; also, I resolved
to see what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole year,
and to sow but once a year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and
rice was much more than I could consume in a year; so I
resolved to sow just the same quantity every year that I sowed
the last, in hopes that such a quantity would fully provide me
with bread, &c.
All the while these things were doing, you may be sure my
thoughts run many times upon the prospect of land which I had
seen from the other side of the island, and I was not without
secret wishes that I were on shore there, fancying the seeing
the mainland, and in an inhabited country, I might find some way
or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at last find some
means of escape.
But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of
such a condition, and howl might fall into the hands of savages,
a'nd perhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse than
the lions and tigers of Africa; that if I once came into their
power, I should run a hazard more than a thousand to one of
being killed, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard that
the people of the Caribbean coasts were cannibals, or man-
eaters, and I knew by the latitude that I could not be far off
from that shore. That suppose they were not cannibals, yet
that they might kill me, as many Europeans who had fallen into
their hands had been served, even when they had been ten or
twenty together, much more I, that was but one, and could
make little or no defence ; all these things, I say, which I ought
to have considered well of, and did cast up in my thoughts after-
wards, yet took up none of my apprehensions at first, but my
head ran mightily upon the thought of getting over to the shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the
shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand
miles on the coast of Africa; but this was in vain. Then I
thought I would go and look at our ship's boat, which, as I have
said, was blown up upon the shore a great way, in the storm,
when we were first cast away. She lay almost where she did at
first, but not quite; and was turned, by the force of the waves
and the winds, almost bottom upward, against a high ridge of
beachy rough sand, but no water about her, as before.
If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to have launched
her into the water, the boat would have done well enough, and
I might have gone back into the Brazils with her easily enough;
but I might have foreseen that I could no more turn her and set
her upright upon her bottom, than I could remove the island.
However, I went to the woods, and cut levers and rollers, and
brought them to the boat, resolved to try what I could do;
suggesting to myself that if I could but turn her down, I might
easily repair the damage she had received, and she would be a
very good boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily.
I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and
spent, I think, three or four weeks about it. At last finding it
impossible to heave it up with my little strength, I fell to digging
away the sand, to undermine it, and so to make it fall down,
setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to
get under it, much less to move it forward towards the water; sb
I was forced to give it over. And yet, though I gave over the
hopes of the boat, my desire to venture over for the main
increased, rather than decreased, as the means for it seemed
impossible.
This at length put me upon thinking whether it was not
possible to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives
of those climates make, even without tools, or, as I might say,
without hands, viz., of the trunk of a great tree. This 1 not
only thought possible, but easy, and pleased myself extremely
with the thoughts of making it, and with my having much more
convenience for it than any of the negroes or Indians; but not
at all considering the particular inconveniences which I lay
under more than the Indians did, viz., want of hands to move
it, when it was made, into the water, a difficulty much harder for
me to surmount than all the consequences of want of tools
could be to them. For what was it to me, that when I had
chosen a vast tree in the woods, I might with much trouble cut
it down, if, after I might be able with my tools to hew and dub
the outside into the proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out
the inside to make it hollow, so to make a boat of it; if, after
all this, I must leave it just there where I found it, and was not
able to launch it into the water?
One would have thought I could not have had the least
reflection upon my mind of my circumstance while I was mak-
ing this boat, but I should have immediately thought how I
should get it into the sea; but my thoughts were so intent upon
my voyage over the sea in it, that I never once considered how
I should get it off of the land; and it was really, in its own
nature, more easy for me to guide it over forty-five miles of sea,
than about forty-five fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it
afloat in the water.
I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever
man did who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself
with the design, without determining whether I was ever able to
undertake it. Not but that the difficulty of launching my boat
came often into my head ; but I put a stop to my own inquiries
into it, by this foolish answer which I gave myself, " Let's first
make it; I'll warrant I'll find some way or other to get it along
when 'tis done."
This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of
my fancy prevailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar tree:
I question much whether Solomon ever had such a one for the
building of the Temple at Jerusalem. It was five feet ten inches
diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven
inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it
lessened for a while, and then parted into branches. It was not
without infinite labour that I felled this tree. I was twenty days
hacking and hewing at it at the bottom; I was fourteen more
getting the branches and limbs, and the vast spreading head of it
cut ofF, which I hacked and hewed through with axe and hatchet,
and inexpressible labour. After this, it cost me a month to
shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to something like the
bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do.

IT COST ME NEAR THREE MONTHS TO CLEAR THE INSIDE.
It cost me near three months more to clear the inside, and work
it so as to make an exact boat of it. This I did, indeed, without
fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour,
till I had brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and big
enough to have carried six and twenty men, and consequently
big enough to have carried me and all my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was extremely
delighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than I ever
saw a canoe or periagua, that was made of one tree, in my life.
Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may be sure; and there
remained nothing but to get it into the water; and had I gotten
it into the water, I make no question but I should have begun
the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to be performed,
that ever was undertaken.
But all my devices to get it into the water failed me, though
they cost me infinite labour too. It lay about one hundred
yards from the water, and not more ; but the first inconvenience
was, it was uphill towards the creek. Well, to take away this
discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth,
and so make a declivity. This I began, and it cost me a pro-
digious deal of pains; but who grudges pains, that have their
deliverance in view? But when this was worked through, and
this difficulty managed, it was still much at one, for I could no
more stir the canoe than I could the other boat.
Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to
cut a dock or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing
I could not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I began
this work ; and when I began to enter into it, and calculate how
deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff to be thrown out,
I found that by the number of hands I had, being none but my
own, it must have been ten or twelve years before I should have
gone through with it; for the shore lay high, so that at the
upper end it must have been at least twenty feet deep; so at
length, though with great reluctancy, I gave this attempt over
also.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late,
the folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, and
before we judge rightly of our own strength to go through
with it.
In the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this
place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and with
as much comfort as ever before; for, by a constant study and seri-
ous application of the Word of God, and by the assistance of His
grace, I gained a different knowledge from what I had before.
I entertained different notions of things. I looked now upon
the world as a thing remote, which I had nothing to do with,
no expectation from, and, indeed, no desires about. In a word,
I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever like to have;
so I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon it here-
after, viz., as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it; and
well might I say, as father Abraham to Dives, "Between me
and thee is a great gulf fixed."
I had now brought my state of life to be much easier in
itself than it was at first, and much easier to my mind, as well as
to my body. I frequently sat down to my meat with thank-
fulness, and admired the hand of God's providence, which had
thus spread my table in the wilderness. I learned to look more
upon the bright side of my condition, and less upon the dark
side, and to consider what I enjoyed, rather than what I
wanted; and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that
I cannot express them; and which I take notice of here, to put
those discontented people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy
comfortably what God has given them, because they see and
covet something that He has not given them. All our dis-
contents about what we want, appeared to me to spring from
the want of thankfulness for what we have.
I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in re-
presenting to myself, in the most lively colours, how
I must have acted if I had got nothing out of the ship.
How I could not have so much as got any food, except fish and
turtles; and that as it was long before I found any of them, I
must have perished first; that I should have lived, if I had not
perished, like a mere savage; that if I had killed a goat or a
fowl, by any contrivance, I had no way to flay or open them, or
part the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up;
but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, like
a beast.
These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of
Providence to me, and very thankful for my present condition,
with all its hardships and misfortunes.
In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it
was a life of mercy another; and I wanted nothing to make
it a life of comfort, but to be able to make my sense of God's
goodness to me, and care over me in this condition, be
my daily consolation; and after I did make a just improvement
of these things, I went away, and was no more sad.
I had now been here so long, that many things which I
brought on shore for my help were either quite gone, or very
much wasted, and near spent. My ink, as I observed, had
been gone for some time, all but a very little, which I eked out
with water, a little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce left
any appearance of black upon the paper. As long as it lasted,
I made use of it to minute down the days of the month on
which any remarkable thing happened to me. And, first, by
casting up times past, I remember that there was a strange
concurrence of days in the various providences which befell me,
and which, if I had been superstitiously inclined to observe days
as fatal or fortunate, I might have had reason to have looked
upon with a great deal of curiosity.
First, I had observed that the same day that I broke away
from my father and my friends, and ran away to Hull, in order
to go to sea, the same day afterwards I was taken by the
Sallee man-of-war, and made a slave.
The same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck
of that ship in Yarmouth Roads, that same day-year afterwards
I made my escape from Sallee in the boat.
The same day of the year I was born on, viz., the 3<Dth of
September, that same day I had my life so miraculously saved
twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore in this island;
so that my wicked life and my solitary life began both on a
day.
The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was that of my
bread; I mean the biscuit, which I brought out of the ship.
This I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself but
one cake of bread a day for above a year; and yet I was quite
without bread for near a year before 1 got any corn of my own;
and great reason I had to be thankful that I had any at all, the
getting it being, as has been already observed, next to
miraculous.
My clothes began to decay, too, mightily. As to linen, I
had none a good while, except some chequered shirts which I
found in the chests of the other seamen, and which I carefully
preserved, because many times I could bear no other clothes
on but a shirt; and it was a very great help to me that I had,
among all the men's clothes of the ship, almost three dozen of
shirts. There were also several thick watch-coats of the sea-
men's which were left indeed, but they were too hot to wear;
and though it is true that the weather was so violent hot that
there was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite naked,
no, though I had been inclined to it, which I was not, though I
was all alone.
The reason why I could not go quite naked was, I could
not bear the heat of the sun so well when quite naked as with
some clothes on; nay, the very heat frequently blistered my
skin; whereas, with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion,
and whistling under that shirt, was twofold cooler than without
G
it. No more could I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of
the sun without a cap or a hat. The heat of the sun beating
with such violence, as it does in that place, would give me the
headache presently, by darting so directly on my head, with-
out a cap or hat on, so that I could not bear it; whereas, if I
put on my hat, it would presently go away.
Upon those views, I began to consider about putting the
few rags I had, which I called clothes, into some order. I had
worn out all the waistcoats I had, and my business was now to
try if I could not make jackets out of the great watch-coats
which I had by me, and with such other materials as I had; so
I set to work a-tailoring, or rather, indeed, a-botching, for I
made most piteous work of it. However, I made shift to make
two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a
great while. As for breeches or drawers, I made but a very
sorry shift indeed till afterward.
I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures
that I killed, I mean four-footed ones, and I had hung them up
stretched out with sticks in the sun, by which means some of
them were so dry and hard that they were fit for little, but
others it seems were very useful. The first thing I made of
these was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside,
to shoot off the rain; and this I performed so well, that after
this I made me a suit of clothes wholly of these skins, that is to
say, a waistcoat, and breeches open at knees, and both loose, for
they were rather wanting to keep me cool than to keep me
warm. I mu^t not omit to acknowledge that they were
wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter, I was a worse
tailor. However, they were such as I made very good shift
with; and when I was abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair
of my waistcoat and cap being outermost, I was kept very
dry.
After this I spent a great deal of time and pains to
make me an umbrella. I was indeed in great want
of one, and had a great mind to make one. I had seen them
made in the Brazils, where they are very useful in the great heats,
which are there; and I felt the heats every jot as great here,
and greater too, being nearer the equinox. Besides, as I was
obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as
well for the rains as the heats. I took a world of pains at it,
and was a great while before I could make anything likely
to hold: nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two
or three before I made one to my mind ; but at last I made one
that answered indifferently well. The main difficulty I found
was to make it to let down. I could make it to spread ; but if it
did not let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for me
any way but just over my head, which would not do. However,
at last, as I said, I made one to answer, and covered it with
skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the rains like a pent-
house, and kept off the sun so effectually, that I could walk out
in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than I
could before in the coolest; and when I had no need of it,
could close it, and carry it under my arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely
composed by resigning to the will of God, and throwing myself
wholly upon the disposal of His providence.
I cannot say that after this, for five years, any extraordinary
thing happened to me; but I lived on in the same course, in the
same posture and place, just as before. The chief things I was
employed in, besides my yearly labour of planting my barley
and rice, and curing my raisins, of both which I always kept up
just enough to have sufficient stock of one year's provisions
beforehand—I say, besides this yearly labour, and my daily
labour of going out with my gun, I had one labour, to make me
a canoe, which at last I finished ; so that by digging a canal to it
of six feet wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek,
almost half a mile. As for the first, which was so vastly big, as I
made it without considering beforehand, as I ought to do, how I
should be able to launch it; so, never being able to bring it to
the water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie
where it was, as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser next
time. Indeed, the next time, though I could not get a tree
proper for it, and in a place where I could not get the water to
it at any less distance than, as I have said, near half a mile, yet
as I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it over; and
though I was near two years about it, yet I never grudged my
labour, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at last.
However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the
size of it was not at all answerable to the design which I had in
view when I made the first; I mean, of venturing over to the
tirra firma, where it was above forty miles broad. Accord-
ingly, the smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that
design, and now I thought no more of it. But as I had a boat,
my next design was to make a tour round the island; for as I
had been on the other side in one place, crossing, as I have
already described it, over the land, so the discoveries I made in
that little journey made me very eager to see other parts of the
coast; and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing
round the island.
For this purpose, that I might do everything with discretion
and consideration, I fitted up a little mast to my boat, and
made a sail to it out of some of the pieces of the ship's
sail, which lay in store, and of which I had a great stock
by me.
Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found
she would sail very well. Then I made little lockers, or boxes,
at either end of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries, and
ammunition, &c., into, to be kept dry, either from rain or the
spray of the sea; and a little long hollow place I cut in the
inside of the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to
hang down over it to keep it dry.
I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a mast,
to stand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off of me,
like an awning; and thus 1 every now and then took a little
voyage upon the sea, but never went far out, nor far from the
little creek. But at last, being eager to view the circumference
of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my tour; and accord-
ingly I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting in two
dozen of my loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of barley
bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice, a food I eat a great
deal of, a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder and shot
for killing more, and two large watch-coats, of those which, as I
mentioned before, I had saved out of the seamen's chests;
these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover me in the
night.
It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign,
or my captivity, which you please, that I set out on this
"l VICTUALLED MY SHIP FOR THE VOYAGE"
voyage, and I found it much longer than I expected; for
though the island itself was not very large, yet when I came to
the east side of it I found a great ledge of rocks lie out above
two leagues into the sea, some above water, some under it,
and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league
more; so that I was obliged to go a great way out to sea to
double the point.
When first I discovered them, I was going to give over my
enterprise, and come back again, not knowing how far it might
oblige me to go out to sea, and, above all, doubting how I
should get back again, so I came to an anchor; for I had made
me a kind of an anchor with a piece of a broken grappling which
I got out of the ship.
Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore,
climbing up upon a hill, which seemed to overlook that
point, where I saw the full extent of it, and resolved to
venture.
In my viewing the sea from that hill, where I stood, I
perceived a strong, and indeed a most furious current, which
run to the east, and even came close to the point; and I took
the more notice of it, because I saw there might be some
danger that when I came into it I might be carried out to sea
by the strength of it, and not be able to make the island
again. And indeed, had I not gotten first up upon this hill, I
believe it would have been so; for there was the same current
on the other side the island, only that it set off at a farther
distance; and I saw there was a strong eddy under the shore;
so I had nothing to do but to get in out of the first current,
and I should presently be in an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days; because the wind, blowing
pretty fresh at E.S.E., and that being just contrary to the said
current, made a great breach of the sea upon the point; so
that it was not safe for me to keep too close to the shore
for the breach, nor to go too far off because of the
stream.
The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated
overnight, the sea was calm, and I ventured. But I am a
warning piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots; for no
sooner was I come to the point, when even I was not my boat's
length from the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of
water, and a current like the sluice of a mill. It carried my
boat along with it with such violence, that all I could do could
not keep her so much as on the edge of it, but I found it
hurried me farther and farther out from the eddy, which was on
my left hand. There was no wind stirring to help me, and all
I could do with my paddlers signified nothing. And now I
began to give myself over for lost; for, as the current was on
both sides the island, I knew in a few leagues' distance they
must join again, and then I was irrecoverably gone. Nor did I
see any possibility of avoiding it; so that I had no prospect
before me but of perishing; not by the sea, for that was calm
enough, but of starving for hunger. I had indeed found a
tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had
tossed it into the boat; and I had a great jar of fresh water,
that is to say, one of my earthen pots; but what was all this
to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be sure, there
was no shore, no mainland or island, for a thousand leagues at
least.
And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of
God to make the most miserable condition mankind could be
in worse. Now I looked back upon my desolate solitary island
as the most pleasant place in the world, and all the happiness
my heart could wish for was to be but there again. However,
I worked hard, till indeed my strength was almost exhausted,
and kept my boat as much to the northward, that is, towards
the side of the current which the eddy lay on, as possibly I
could; when about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I
thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face, springing up
from the S.S.E. This cheered my heart a little, and especially
when, in about half-an-hour more, it blew a pretty small gentle
gale. By this time I was gotten at a frightful distance from
the island; and had the least cloud or hazy weather intervened,
I had been undone another way too; for I had no compass on
board, and should never have known how to have steered
towards the island if I had but once lost sight of it. But the
weather continuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast
again, and spread my sail, standing away to the north as much
as possible, to get out of the current, north-west; and in
about an hour came within about a mile of the shore, where, it
being smooth water, I soon got to land.
When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God
thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts
of my deliverance by my boat; and refreshing myself with such
things as I had, I brought my boat close to the shore, in a little
cove that I had spied under some trees, and laid me down to
sleep, being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the
voyage.
I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my
boat. I had run so much hazard, and knew too much the case,
to think of attempting it by the way I went out; and what
might be at the other side (I mean the west side) I knew not,
nor had I any mind to run any more ventures. So I only
resolved in the morning to make my way westward along the
shore, and to see if there was no creek where I might lay up
my frigate in safety, so as to have her again if I wanted her.
In about three miles, or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came
to a very good inlet or bay, about a mile over, which narrowed
till it came to a very little rivulet or brook, where I found a
very convenient harbour for my boat, and where she lay as
if she had been in a little dock made on purpose for her.
Here I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went
on shore to look about me, and see where I was.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where
I had been before, when I travelled on foot to that shore; so
taking nothing out of my boat but my gun and my umbrella,
for it was exceedingly hot, 1 began my march. The way was
comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had been upon,
and I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found
everything standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good
order, being, as I said before, my country house.
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest
my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep. But judge
you, if you can, that read my story, what a surprise I must be
in, when I was waked out of my sleep by a voice calling me
by my name several times, " Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe, poor
Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where are
you? Where have you been?"
I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing,
or paddling, as it is called, the first part of the day, and with
walking the latter part, that I did not wake thoroughly; but
dozing between sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed that
somebody spoke to me. But as the voice continued to repeat
"Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe," at last I began to wake more
perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frighted, and started up
in the utmost consternation. But no sooner were my eyes
open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge, and
immediately knew that it was he that spoke to me; for just in
such bemoaning language I had used to talk to him, and teach
him; and he had learned it so perfectly, that he would sit upon
my finger, and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, " Poor
Robin Crusoe! Where are you? Where have you been?
How come you here ?" and such things as I had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that
indeed it could be nobody else, it was a good while before I
could compose myself. First, I was amazed how the creature
got thither, and then, how he should just keep about the place,
and nowhere else. But as I was well satisfied it could be
nobody but honest Poll, I got it over; and holding out my
hand, and calling him by his name, Poll, the sociable creature
came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, and
continued talking to me, "Poor Robin Crusoe! and how
did I come here? and where had I been?" just as if he had
been overjoyed to see me again; and so I carried him home
along with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time,
and had enough to do for many days to sit still, and reflect
upon the danger I had been in. I would have been very glad
to have had my boat again on my side of the island; but I
knew not how it was practicable to get it about. As to the
east side of the island, which I had gone round, I knew well
enough there was no venturing that way; my very heart would
shrink, and my very blood run chill, but to think of it. And
as to the other side of the island, I did not know how it
might be there; but supposing the current ran with the same
force against the shore at the east as it passed by it on the
other, I might run the same risk of being driven down the
stream, and carried by the island, as I had been before of being
carried away from it. So, with these thoughts, I contented
myself to be without any boat, though it had been the product
of so many months' labour to make it, and of so many more
to get it unto the sea.
In this government of my temper I remained near a year,
lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose;
and my thoughts being very much composed as to my
condition, and fully comforted in resigning myself to the
dispositions of Providence, I thought I lived really very happily
in all things, except that of society.
I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises
which my necessities put me upon applying myself to, and I
believe could, upon occasion, make a very good carpenter,
especially considering how few tools I had. Besides this, I
arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthenware, and
contrived well enough to make them with a wheel, which I
found infinitely easier and better, because I made things
round and shapable which before were filthy things indeed
to look on. But I think I was never more vain of my own
performance, or more joyful for anything I found out, than
for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe. And though it
was a very ugly clumsy thing when it was done, and only burnt
red, like other earthenware, yet as it was hard and firm, and
would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it;
for I had been always used to smoke, and there were pipes in
the ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing that there was
tobacco in the island; and afterwards, when I searched the
ship again, I could not come at any pipes at all.
In my wicker-ware also I improved much, and made
abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my invention showed
me; though not very handsome, yet they were such as were
very handy and convenient for my laying things up in, or
fetching things home in. For example, if I killed a goat
abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and dress it, and
cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket; and the like by
a turtle; I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or
two of the flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them
home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also large
deep baskets were my receivers for my corn, which I always
rubbed out as soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in
great baskets.
I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably,
and this was a want which it was impossible for me to supply,
and I began seriously to consider what I must do when I should
have no more powder; that is to say, how I should do to kill
any goats. I had, as is observed, in the third year of my being
here kept a young kid, and bred her up tame. I could never
find in my heart to kill her, till she died at last of mere age.
But being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and,
as I have said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to
study some art to trap and snare the goats, to see whether I
could not catch some of them alive.
To this purpose, I made snares to hamper them, and I do
believe they were more than once taken in them; but my tackle
was not good, for I had no wire, and I always found them
broken, and my bait devoured. At length I resolved to try a
pitfall; so I dug several large pits in the earth, in places where
I had observed the goats used to feed, and over these pits I
placed hurdles, of my own making too, with a great weight
upon them; and several times I put ears of barley and dry
rice, without setting the trap, and I could easily perceive that
the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn, for I could see
the mark of their feet. At length I set three traps in one
night, and going the next morning, I found them all standing,
and yet the bait eaten and gone; this was very discouraging.'
However, I altered my trap; and, not to trouble you with
particulars, going one morning to see my trap, I found in
one of them a large old he-goat, and in one of the other
three kids.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him, he was
so fierce I durst not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to
go about to bring him away alive, which was what I wanted.
So I even let him out, and he ran away, as if he had been
frighted out of his wits. But I had forgot then what I learned
afterwards, that hunger will tame a lion. If I had let him stay
there three or four days without food, and then have carried
him some water to drink, and then a little corn, he would have
been as tame as one of the kids, for they are mighty sagacious,
tractable creatures where they are well used.
However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better
at that time. Then I went to the three kids, and taking them
one by one, I tied them with strings together, and with some
difficulty brought them all home.
It was a good while before they would feed, but throwing
them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to
be tame. And now I found that if I expected to supply
myself with goat-flesh when I had no powder or shot left,
breeding some up tame was my only way, when perhaps I
might have them about my house like a flock of sheep.
But then it presently occurred to me that I must keep the
tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild when
they grew up; and the only way for this was to have some
enclosed piece of ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale,
to keep them in so effectually, that those within might not
break out, or those without break in.
This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet as
I saw there was an absolute necessity of doing it, my first piece
of work was to find out a proper piece of ground, viz., where
there was likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for them
to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.
For the first beginning, I resolved to enclose a piece of
about 150 yards in length, and 100 yards in breadth; which, as
it would maintain as many as I should have in any reasonable
time, so, as my flock increased, I could add more ground to my
enclosure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work
with courage. I was about three months hedging in the first
piece, and, till I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the
best part of it, and used them to feed as near me as possible, to
make them familiar; and very often I would go and carry them
some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them out of
my hand; so that after my enclosure was finished, and I let
them loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating after
me for a handful of corn.
This answered my end, and in about a year and half I had
a flock of about twelve goats, kids, and all; and in two years
more I had three and forty, besides several that I took and
killed for my food. And after that I enclosed five several pieces
of ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive them into, to
take them as I wanted, and gates out of one piece of ground
into another.
But this was not all, for now I not only had goat's flesh to
feed on when I pleased, but milk too, a thing which, indeed, in
my beginning, I did not so much as think of, and which,
when it came into my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise.
For now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two
of milk in a day; and as Nature, who gives supplies of food to
every creature, dictates even naturally how to make use of it,
so I, that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen
butter or cheese made, very readily and handily, though after a
great many essays and miscarriages, made me both butter and
cheese at last, and never wanted it afterwards.
It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen me and my
little family sit down to dinner. There was my majesty, the
prince and lord of the whole island; I had the lives of all my
subjects at my absolute command. I could hang, draw, give
liberty, and take it away; and no rebels among all my
subjects.
Then to see how like a king I dined, too, all alone, attended
by my servants. Poll, as if he had been my favourite, was the
only person permitted to talk to me. My dog, who was now
grown very old and crazy, sat always at my right hand, and
two cats, one on one side the table, and one on the other,
expecting now and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of
special favour.
With this attendance, and in this plentiful manner, I lived;
neither could I be said to want anything but society; and of
that in some time after this, I was like to have too much.
I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the
use of my boat, though very loth to run any more hazards; and
therefore sometimes I sat contriving ways to get her about the
island, and at other times I sat myself down contented enough
without her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go
down to the point of the island, where, as I have said, in my
last ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and
how the current set, that I might see what I had to do. This
inclination increased upon me every day, and at length I re-
solved to travel thither by land, following the edge of the shore.
I did so; but had anyone in England been to meet such a man
as I was, it must either have frighted them, or raised a great
deal of laughter; and as I frequently stood still to look at
myself, I could not but smile at the notion of my travelling
through Yorkshire, with such an equipage, and in such a dress.
Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure, as follows.
I had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, with
a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me,
as to shoot the rain off from running into my neck; nothing
being so hurtful in these climates as the rain upon the flesh,
under the clothes.
I had a short jacket of goat-skin, the skirts coming down to
about the middle of my thighs; and a pair of open-kneed
breeches of the same. The breeches were made of the skin of an
old he-goat, whose hair hung down such a length on either side,
that, like pantaloons, it reached to the middle of my legs. Stock-
ings and shoes I had none, but had made me a pair of somethings,
I scarce know what to call them, like buskins, to flap over my
legs, and lace on either side like spatterdashes; but of a most
barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes.
I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew to-
gether with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles; and in
a kind of a frog on either side of this, instead of a sword and a
dagger, hung a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side, one
on the other. I had another belt, not so broad, and fastened
in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder; and at the
end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both made of
goat's skin too; in one of which hung my powder, in the other
my shot . At my back I carried my basket, on my shoulder my
gun, and over my head a great clumsy ugly goat-skin umbrella,
but which, after all, was the most necessary thing I had about
me, next to my gun. As for my face, the colour of it was really
not so mulatto-like as one might expect from a man not at
all careful of it, and living within nineteen degrees of the
equinox. My beard I had once suffered to grow till it was about
a quarter of a yard long; but as I had both scissors and razors
sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on my
upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan
whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks whom I saw
at Sallee; for the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks
did. Of these mustachios or whiskers, I will not say they were
long enough to hang my hat upon them, but they were of a
length and shape monstrous enough, and such as, in England,
would have passed for frightful.
But all this is by-the-by; for, as to my figure, I had so few
to observe me, that it was of no manner of consequence; so I
say no more to that part. In this kind of figure 1 went my
new journey, and was out five or six days. I travelled first
along the sea-shore, directly to the place where I first brought
my boat to an anchor, to get up upon the rocks. And having
no boat now to take care of, I went over the land, a nearer way,
to the same height that I was upon before; when, looking
forward to the point of the rocks which lay out, and which I was
obliged to double with my boat, as is said above, I was sur-
prised to see the sea all smooth and quiet.no rippling, no motion,
no current, any more there than in other places.
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved to
spend some time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the
sets of the tide had occasioned it.
My observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but
to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might
very easily bring my boat about the island again. But when I
began to think of putting it in practice, I had such a terror upon
my spirits at the remembrance of the danger I had been in, that
I could not think of it again with any patience; but, on the
contrary, I took up another resolution, which was more safe,
though more laborious; and this was, that I would build, or
rather make me another feriagua or canoe; and so have one for
one side of the island, and one for the other.
You are to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two
plantations in the island; one, my little fortification or tent,
with the wall about it, under the rock, with the cave behind me,
which, by this time, I had enlarged into several apartments or
caves, one within another. One of these, which was the driest
and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall or fortifica-
tion, that is to say, beyond where my wall joined to the
rock, was all filled up with the large earthen pots, of which
I have given an account, and with fourteen or fifteen great
baskets, which would hold five or six bushels each, where I
laid up my stores of provision, especially my corn, some in the
ear, cut off short from the straw, and the other rubbed out with
my hand.
As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles,
those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so
big, and spread so very much, that there was not the least
appearance, to any one's view, of any habitation behind them.
Near this dwelling of mine, but a little further within the
land, and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn ground,
which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded
me their harvest in its season; and whenever I had occasion
for more corn, I had more land adjoining as fit as that.
Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had now a toler-
able plantation there also; for, first, I had my little bower, as I
called it, which I kept in repair; that is to say, 1 kept the hedge
which circled it in constantly fitted up to its usual height, the
ladder standing always in the inside. I kept the trees, which
at first were no more than my stakes, but were now grown very
firm and tall, I kept them always so cut, that they might spread
and grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable shade,
which they did effectually to my mind. In the middle of this,
I had my tent always standing, being a piece of a sail spread
over poles, set up for that purpose, and which never wanted any
repair or renewing; and under this I had made me a squab or
couch, with the skins of the creatures I had killed, and with
other soft things, and a blanket laid on them, such as belonged
to our sea-bedding, which I had saved, and a great watch-coat
to cover me; and here, whenever I had occasion to be absent
from my chief seat, I took up my country habitation.
Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is
to say, my goats. And as I had taken an inconceivable deal of
pains to fence and enclose this ground, so I was so uneasy to
see it kept entire, lest the goats should break through, that I
never left off till, with infinite labour, I had stuck the outside of
the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near to one another,
that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce
room to put a hand through between them; which afterwards,
when those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy season,
made the enclosure strong like a wall, indeed, stronger than any
wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared
no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my
comfortable support; for I considered the keeping up a breed
of tame creatures thus at my hand would be a living magazine
of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for me as long as I lived in the
place, if it were to be forty years; and that keeping them in my
reach depended entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures to
such a degree, that I might be sure of keeping them together;
which, by this method, indeed, I so effectually secured, that
when these little stakes began to grow, I had planted them so
very thick, I was forced to pull some of them up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I princi-
pally depended on for my winter store of raisins, and which I
never failed to preserve very carefully, as the best and most
agreeable dainty of my whole diet. And indeed they were not
agreeable only, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and re-
freshing to the last degree.
As this was also about half-way between my other habita-
tion and the place where I had laid up my boat, I generally stayed
and lay here in my way thither; for I used frequently to visit
my boat, and I kept all things about, or belonging to her, in
very good order. Sometimes I went out in her to divert myself,
but no more hazardous voyages would I go, nor scarce ever
above a stone's cast or two from the shore, I was so apprehensive
of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents or
winds, or any other accident. But now I come to a new scene
of my life.
It happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat,
I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked
foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen in the sand.
I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition.
I listened, I looked round me, I could hear nothing, nor see any-
thing. I went up to a rising ground, to look farther. I went
up the shore, and down the shore, but it was all one; I could
I STOOD LIKE ONE THUNDKE.STXUCK.
see no other impression but that one. I went to it again to see
if there were any more, and to observe if it might not be my
fancy; but there was no room for that, for there was exactly
the very print of a foot—toes, heel, and every part of a foot.
How it came thither I knew not, nor could in the least imagine.
But after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly
confused and out of myself, I came home to my fortification,
not feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but terrified to the
last degree, looking behind me at every two or three steps,
mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying every stump at a
distance to be a man ; nor is it possible to describe how many
various shapes affrighted imagination represented things to me
in, how many wild ideas were found every moment in my fancy,
and what strange unaccountable whimsies came into my thoughts
by the way.
When I came to my castle, for so I think I called it ever
after this, I fled into it like one pursued. Whether I went over
by the ladder, as first contrived, or went in at the hole in the
rock, which I called a door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I
remember the next morning, for never frighted hare fled to
cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than I to this
retreat.
I slept none that night. The farther I was from the occasion
of my fright, the greater my apprehensions were; which is some-
thing contrary to the nature of such things, and especially to
the usual practice of all creatures in fear. But I was so embar-
rassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing, that I formed
nothing but dismal imaginations to myself, even though I was
now a great way off it. Sometimes I fancied it must be the
devil, and reason joined in with me upon this supposition ; for
how should any other thing in human shape come into the place?
Where was the vessel that brought them? What marks was
there of any other footsteps? And how was it possible a man
should come there? But then to think that Satan should take
human shape upon him in such a place, where there could be
no manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of his
foot behind him, and that even for no purpose too, for he
could not be sure I should see it; this was an amusement the
other way. I considered that the devil might have found out
abundance of other ways to have terrified me than this of the
single print of a foot; that as I live quite on the other side of
the island, he would never have been so simple to leave a mark
in a place where it was ten thousand to one whether I should
ever see it or not, and in the sand too, which the first surge of
the sea, upon a high wind, would have defaced entirely. All
this seemed inconsistent with the thing itself, and with all the
notions we usually entertain of the subtilty of the devil.
Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out
of all apprehensions of its being the devil; and I presently con-
cluded then, that it must be some more dangerous creature, viz.,
that it must be some of the savages of the mainland over against
me, who had wandered out to sea in their canoes, and, either
driven by the currents or by contrary winds, had made the
island, and had been on shore, but were gone away again to
sea, being as loth, perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate island
as I would have been to have had them.
While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I was
very thankful in my thoughts that I was so happy as not to be
thereabouts at that time, or that they did not see my boat, by
which they would have concluded that some inhabitants had
been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther for me.
Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about their
having found my boat, and that there were people here; and
that if so, I should certainly have them come again in greater
numbers, and devour me; that if it should happen so that they
should not find me, yet they would find my enclosure, destroy
all my corn, carry away all my flock of tame goats, and I should
perish at last for mere want.
Thus my fear banished all my religious hope. All that
former confidence in God, which was founded upon such
wonderful experience as I had had of His goodness, now
vanished, as if He that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not
preserve, by His power, the provision which He had made for
me by His goodness. I reproached myself with my easiness,
that would not sow any more corn one year than would
just serve me till the next season, as if no accident could
intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the
ground. And this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved
for the future to have two or three years' corn beforehand, so
that, whatever might come, I might not perish for want of
bread.
I then reflected that God, who was not only righteous, but
omnipotent, as He had thought fit thus to punish and afflict
me, so He was able to deliver me; that if He did not think fit
to do it, 'twas my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely
and entirely to His will; and, on the other hand.it was my
duty also to hope in Him, pray to Him, and quietly to attend
the dictates and directions of His daily providence.
These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may
say, weeks and months; and one particular effect of my
cogitations on this occasion I cannot omit, viz., one morning
early, lying in my bed, and filled with thought about my danger
from the appearance of savages, I found it discomposed me
very much; upon which those words of the Scripture came into
my thoughts, "Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will
deliver, and thou shalt glorify Me."
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and re-
flections, it came into my thought one day, that all this might
be a mere chimera of my own; and that this foot might be the
print of my own foot, when I came on shore from my boat.
This cheered me up a little too, and I began to persuade my-
self it was all a delusion, that it was nothing else but my own
foot; and why might not I come that way from the boat, as
well as I was going that way to the boat? Again, I considered
also, that I could by no means tell, for certain, where I had
trod, and where I had not; and that if, at last, this was only the
print of my own foot, I had played the part of those fools who
strive to make stories of spectres and apparitions, and then are
frighted at them more than anybody.
Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for
I had not stirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so
that I began to starve for provision; for I had little or nothing
within doors but some barley-cakes and water. Then I knew
that my goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was my
evening diversion; and the poor creatures were in great pain
and inconvenience for want of it; and, indeed, it almost spoiled
some of them, and almost dried up their milk.
Heartening myself, therefore, with the belief that this was
nothing but the print of one of my own feet, and so I might be
truly said to start at my own shadow, I began to go abroad
again, and went to my country house to milk my flock. But to
see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked behind
me, how I was ready, every now and then, to lay down my
basket, and run for my life, it would have made any one have
thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had been
lately most terribly frighted; and so, indeed, I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three days, and having
seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to think there
was really nothing in it but my own imagination. But I could
not persuade myself fully of this till I should go down to the
shore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my
own, and see if there was any similitude or fitness, that I might
be assured it was my own foot. But when I came to the place,
first, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my boat,
I could not possibly be on shore anywhere thereabout;
secondly, when I came to measure the mark with my own foot,
I found my foot not so large by a great deal. Both these
things filled my head with new imaginations, and gave me the
vapours again to the highest degree; so that I shook with cold,
like one in an ague; and I went home again, filled with the
belief that some man or men had been on shore there; or, in
short, that the island was inhabited, and I might be surprised
before I was aware. And what course to take for my security,
I knew not.
The confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all night,
but in the morning I fell asleep; and having, by the amusement
of my mind, been, as it were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I
slept very soundly, and waked much better composed than I
had ever been before. And now I began to think sedately;
and upon the utmost debate with myself, I concluded that this
island, which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther
from the mainland than as I had seen, was not so entirely
abandoned as I might imagine; that although there were no
stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet that there might
sometimes come boats off from the shore, who, either with
design, or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross
winds, might come to this place; that I had lived here fifteen
years now, and had not met with the least shadow or figure of
any people yet; and that if at any time they should be driven
here, it was probable they went away again as soon as ever
they could, seeing they had never thought fit to fix there upon
any occasion to this time; that the most I could suggest any
danger from, was from any such casual accidental landing of
straggling people from the main, who, as it was likely, if they
were driven hither, were here against their wills; so they made
no stay here, but went off again with all possible speed, seldom
staying one night on shore, lest they should not have the help
of the tides and daylight back again; and that, therefore, I had
nothing to do but to consider of some safe retreat, in case I
should see any savages land upon the spot.
Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so
large as to bring a door through again, which door, as I said,
came out beyond where my fortification joined to the rock.
Upon maturely considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw
me a second fortification, in the same manner of a semicircle,
at a distance from my wall, just where I had planted a double
row of trees about twelve years before, of which I made mention.
These trees having been planted so thick before, they wanted
but a few piles to be driven between them, that they should be
thicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon finished.
So that I had now a double wall; and my outer wall was
thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and everything I
could think of, to make it strong, having in it seven little holes,
about as big as I might put my arm out at. In the inside of
this I thickened my wall to above ten feet thick, with continual
bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the
wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven holes I con-
trived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I got
seven on shore out of the ship. These, I say, I planted like my
cannon, and fitted them into frames, that held them like a
carriage, that so I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes'
time. This wall I was many a weary month a-finishing, and
yet never thought myself safe till it was done.
When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall,
for a great way every way, as full with stakes, or sticks, of the

osier-like wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they could
well stand; insomuch, that I believe I might set in near twenty
thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space between them
and my wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, and they
might have no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted
to approach my outer wall.
Thus in two years' time I had a thick grove; and in five or
six years' time I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so
monstrous thick and strong, that it was indeed perfectly im-
passable; and no men, of what kind soever, would ever imagine
that there was anything beyond it, much less a habitation. As
for the way which I proposed to myself to go in and out, for I
left no avenue, it was by setting two ladders, one to a part of
the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to
place another ladder upon that; so when the two ladders were
taken down, no man living could come down to me without
mischieving himself; and if they had come down, they were still
on the outside of my outer wall.
Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest
for my own preservation; and it will be seen, at length, that
they were not altogether without just reason; though I foresaw
nothing at that time more than my mere fear suggested to
me.
While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my
other affairs; for I had a great concern upon me for my little
herd of goats. They were not only a present supply to me
upon every occasion, and began to be sufficient to me, without
the expense of powder and shot, but also without the fatigue of
hunting after the wild ones; and I was loth to lose the ad-
vantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.
To this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of
but two ways to preserve them. One was, to find another con-
venient place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive them
into it every night; and the other was, to enclose two or three
little bits of land, remote from one another, and as much con-
cealed as I could, where I might keep about half-a-dozen young
goats in each place; so that if any disaster happened to the
flock in general, I might be able to raise them again with little
trouble and time. And this, though it would require a great deal
of time and labour, I thought was the most rational design.
Accordingly I spent some time to find out the most retired
parts of the island; and I pitched upon one which was as private
indeed as my heart could wish for. It was a little damp piece
of ground, in the middle of the hollow and thick woods, where,
as is observed,! almost lost myself once before, endeavouring to
come back that way from the eastern part of the island. Here
I found a clear piece of land, near three acres, so surrounded
with woods, that it was almost an enclosure by Nature; at least,
it did not want near so much labour to make it so as the other
pieces of ground I had worked so hard at.
I immediately went to work with this piece of ground, and
in less than a month's time I had so fenced it round, that my
flock, or herd, call it which you please, who were not so wild
now as at first they might be supposed to be, were well enough
secured in it. So, without any farther delay, I removed ten
young she-goats and two he-goats to this piece. And when
they were there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had made
it as secure as the other, which, however, I did at more leisure,
and it took me up more time by a great deal.
All this labour I was at the expense of, purely from my
apprehensions on the account of the print of a man's foot which
I had seen ; for, as yet, I never saw any human creature come
near the island. And I had now lived two years under these
uneasinesses, which, indeed, made my life much less comfortable
than it was before, as may well be imagined by any who know
what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear of man. And
this I must observe, with grief too, that the discomposure of my
mind had too great impressions also upon the religious part of
my thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into the hands
of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I seldom
found myself in a due temper for application to my Maker, at
least not with the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which
I was wont to do.
But to go on. After I had thus secured one part of my little
living stock, I went about the whole island, searching for another
private place to make such another deposit; when, wandering
more to the west point of the island than I had ever done yet,
and looking out to sea, 1 thought I saw a boat upon the sea, at
a great distance. I had found a prospective glass or two in one
of the seamen's chests, which I saved out of our ship, but I had
it not about me; and this was so remote, that I could not tell
what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not
able to hold to look any longer. Whether it was a boat or not, I
do not know; but as I descended from the hill, I could see no
more of it, so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more out
without a prospective glass in my pocket.
When I was come down the hill to the end of the island,
where, indeed, I had never been before, I was presently con-
vinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not such a
strange thing in the island as I imagined. And, but that it was
a special providence that I was cast upon the side of the island
where the savages never came, I should easily have known that
nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from the main,
when they happened to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over
to that side of the island for harbour; likewise, as they often
met and fought in their canoes, the victors having taken any
prisoners would bring them over to this shore, where, according
to their dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill
and eat them; of which hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above,
being the S.W. point of the island, I was perfectly confounded
and amazed; nor is it possible for me to express the horror of
my mind at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and
other bones of human bodies; and particularly, I observed a
place where there had been a fire made, and a circle dug in the
earth, like a cockpit, where it is supposed the savage wretches
had sat down to their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of
their fellow-creatures.
I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I
entertained no notion of any danger to myself from it for a long
while. All my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of
such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of
the degeneracy of human nature, which, though I had heard of
often, yet I never had so near a view of before. In short, I
turned away my face from the horrid spectacle. I got me up
the hill again with all the speed I could, and walked on towards
my own habitation.
When I came a little out of that part of the island, I stood
still a while, as amazed; and then recovering myself, I looked
up with the utmost affection of my soul, and with a flood of
tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot in
a part of the world where I was distinguished from such dread-
ful creatures as these.
In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my castle, and
began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my circum-
stances, than ever I was before; for I observed that these
wretches never came to this island in search of what they could
get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting, any-
thing here; and having often, no doubt, been up in the covered,
woody part of it, without finding anything to their purpose. I
knew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never
saw the least footsteps of human creature there before; and I
might be here eighteen more as entirely concealed as I was
now, if I did not discover myself to them, which I had no
manner of occasion to do; it being my only business to keep
myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I found a better
sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to.
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches
that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman
custom of their devouring and eating one another up, that I
continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my own
circle for almost two years after this. When I say my own
circle, I mean by it my three plantations, viz., my castle, my
country seat, which I called my bower, and my enclosure in
the woods. Nor did I look after this for any other use than as
an enclosure for my goats; for the aversion which Nature gave
me to these hellish wretches was such, that I was fearful of
seeing them as of seeing the devil himself.
Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no
danger of being discovered by these people, began to wear off
my uneasiness about them; and I began to live just in the
same composed manner as before; only with this difference,
that I used more caution, and kept my eyes more about me,
than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of
them; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun,
lest any of them being on the island should happen to hear of
it. And it was, therefore, a very good providence to me that I
had furnished myself with a tame breed of goats, that I needed
not hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them. And if
I did catch any of them after this, it was by traps and snares,
as I had done before; so that for two years after this I believe
I never fired my gun once off, though I never went out without
it; and, which was more, as I had saved three pistols out of the
ship, I always carried them out with me, or at least two of
them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt. Also I furbished up
one of the great cutlasses that 1 had out of the ship, and made
me a belt to put it on also; so that I was now a most formid-
able fellow to look at when I went abroad, if you add to the
former description of myself the particular of two pistols and a
great broadsword hanging at my side in a belt, but without a
scabbard.
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed,
excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm,
sedate way of living. All these things tended to showing me,
more and more, how far my condition was from being miserable,
compared to some others; nay, to many other particulars of
life, which it might have pleased God to have made my lot. It
put me upon reflecting how little repining there would be
among mankind at any condition of life, if people would rather
compare their condition with those that are worse, in order to
be thankful, than be always comparing them with those which
are better, to assist their murmurings and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not really many
things which I wanted, so indeed I thought that the frights I
had been in about these savage wretches, and the concern I had
been in for my own preservation, had taken off the edge of my
invention for my own conveniences. And I had dropped a
good design, which I had once bent my thoughts too much
upon; and that was, to try if I could not make some of my
barley into malt, and then try to brew myself some beer.
But my invention now run quite another way; for, night
and day, I could think of nothing but how I might destroy
some of these monsters in their cruel, bloody entertainment,
and, if possible, save the victim they should bring hither to
destroy. It would take up a larger volume than this whole
work is intended to be, to set down all the contrivances I
hatched, or rather brooded upon, in my thought, for the
destroying these creatures, or at least frighting them so
as to prevent their coming hither any more. But all was
abortive; nothing could be possible to take effect, unless
I was to be there to do it myself. And what could one
man do among them, when perhaps there might be twenty
or thirty of them together, with their darts, or their bows and
arrows, with which they could shoot as true to a mark as I
could with my gun?
Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the place where
they made their fire, and put in five or six pound of gunpowder,
which, when they kindled their fire, would consequently take
fire, and blow up all that was near it. But as, in the first place,
I should be very loth to waste so much powder upon them, my
store being now within the quantity of one barrel, so neither
could I be sure of its going off at any certain time, when it
might surprise them; and, at best, that it would do little more
than just blow the fire about their ears, and fright them, but not
sufficient to make them forsake the place. So I laid it aside,
and then proposed that I would place myself in ambush in
some convenient place, with my three guns all double-loaded,
and, in the middle of their bloody ceremony, let fly at them,
when I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at
every shot; and then falling in upon them with my three pistols
and my sword, I made no doubt but that if there was twenty I
should kill them all. This fancy pleased my thoughts for some
weeks; and I was so full of it, that I often dreamed of it, and
sometimes that I was just going to let fly at them in my sleep.
I went so far with it in my imagination, that I employed
myself several days to find out proper places to put myself in
ambuscade, as I said, to watch for them ; and I went frequently
to the place itself, which was now grown more familiar to me;
and especially while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of
revenge, and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to
the sword, as I may call it, the horror I had at the place, and at
the signals of the barbarous wretches devouring one another,
abated my malice.
Well, at length I found a place in the side of the hill, where
I was satisfied I might securely wait till I saw any of their
boats coming; and might then, even before they would be ready
to come on shore, convey myself, unseen, into thickets of trees,
in one of which there was a hollow large enough to conceal me
entirely; and where I might sit and observe all their bloody
doings, and take my full aim at their heads, when they were so
close together, as that it would be next to impossible that I
should miss my shot, or that I could fail wounding three or four
of them at the first shot.
In this place, then, I resolved to fix my design ; and, accord-
ingly, I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece.
The two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four
or five smaller bullets, about the size of pistol-bullets; and the
fowling-piece I loaded with near a handful of swan-shot, of the
largest size. I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets
each; and in this posture, well provided with ammunition for a
second and third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition.
After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my
imagination put it in practice, I continually made my tour every
morning up to the top of the hill, which was from my castle, as
I called it, about three miles, or more, to see if I could observe
any boats upon the sea coming near the island, or standing
over towards it. But I began to tire of this hard duty, after
I had, for two or three months, constantly kept my watch, but
came always back without any discovery; there having not, in
all that time, been the least appearance, not only on or near the
shore, but not on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses
could reach every way.
As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to look out,
so long also I kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits
seemed to be all ihe while in a suitable form for so outrageous
an execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages for
an offence which I had not at all entered into a discussion of in
my thoughts, any farther than my passions were at first fired
by the horror I conceived at the unnatural custom of that people
of the country.
But when I had considered a little, it followed necessarily
that I was certainly in the wrong in it; that these people were
not murderers in the sense that I had before condemned them
in my thoughts, any more than those Christians were murderers
who often put to death the prisoners taken in battle; or more
frequently, upon many occasions, put whole troops of men to
the sword, without giving quarter, though they threw down
their arms and submitted.
In the next place it occurred to me, that albeit the usage
they thus gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet
it was really nothing to me; these people had done me no
injury. That if they attempted me, or I saw it necessary for
my immediate preservation to fall upon them, something might
be said for it; but that as I was yet out of their power, and they
had really no knowledge of me, and consequently no design
upon me, and therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon
them.
These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind
of a full stop; and I began, by little and little, to be off of my
design, and to conclude I had taken wrong measures in my
resolutions to attack the savages; that it was not my business
to meddle with them, unless they first attacked me; and this it
was my business, if possible, to prevent; but that if I were dis-
covered and attacked, then I knew my duty.
On the other hand, I argued with myself that this really was
the way not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy
myself; for unless I was sure to kill every one that not only
should be on shore at that time, but that should ever come on
shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped to tell their
country people what had happened, they would come over
again by thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and I
should only bring upon myself a certain destruction, which, at
present, I had no manner of occasion for.
Upon the whole, I concluded that neither in principles nor
in policy I ought, one way or other, to concern myself in this
affair. That my business was, by all possible means, to conceal
myself from them, and not to leave the least signal to them to
guess by that there were any living creatures upon the island;
I mean of human shape.
Religion joined in with this prudential, and I was convinced
now, many ways, that I was perfectly out of my duty when I
was laying all my bloody schemes for the destruction of inno-
cent creatures; I mean innocent as to me. As to the crimes
they were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing to do
with them. They were national, and I ought to leave them to
the justice of God, who is the Governor of nations, and knows
how, by national punishments, to make a just retribution for
national offences, and to bring public judgments upon those who
offend in a public manner by such ways as best pleases Him.
In this disposition I continued for near a year after this;
and so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these
wretches, that in all that time I never once went up the hill to
see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know
whether any of them had been on shore there or not, that I
might not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against
them, or be provoked, by any advantage which might present
itself, to fall upon them. Only this I did, I went and removed
my boat, which I had on the other side the island, and carried
it down to the east end of the whole island, where I ran it into
a little cove, which I found under some high rocks, and where I
knew, by reason of the currents, the savages durst not, at least
would not come, with their boats, upon any account what-
soever.
With my boat I carried away everything that I had left
there belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare going
thither, viz., a mast and sail which I had made for her, and a
thing like an anchor, but indeed which could not be called
either anchor or grappling ; however, it was the best I could
make of its kind. All these I removed, that there might not be
the least shadow of any discovery, or any appearance of any
boat, or of any human habitation, upon the island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than
ever, and seldom went from my cell, other than upon my con-
stant employment, viz., to milk my she-goats, and manage my
little flock in the wood, which, as it was quite on the oth.er part
of the island, was quite out of danger; for certain it is, that
these savage people, who sometimes haunted this island, never
came with any thoughts of finding anything here, and conse-
quently never wandered off from the coast; and I doubt not but
they might have been several times on shore after my appre-
hensions of them had made me cautious, as well as before; and
indeed, I looked back with some horror upon the thoughts of
what my condition would have been if I had chopped upon
them and been discovered before that, when, naked and
unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded often only with
small shot, I walked everywhere, peeping and peeping about
the island to see what I could get. What a surprise should I
have been in if, when I discovered the print of a man's foot, I
had, instead of that, seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found
them pursuing me, and by the swiftness of their running, no
possibility of my escaping them!
I believe the reader of this will not think strange if I confess
that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the
concern that was now upon me, put an end to all invention, and
to all the contrivances that I had laid for my future accommoda-
tions and conveniences. I had the care of my safety more now
upon my hands than that of my food. I cared not to drive a
nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I should
make should be heard; much less would I fire a gun, for the
same reason; and, above all, I was intolerably uneasy at
making any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a great
distance in the day, should betray me; and for this reason I
removed that part of my business which required fire, such as
burning of pots and pipes, etc., into my new apartment in the
woods; where, after I had been some time, I found, to my un-
speakable consolation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which
went in a vast way, and where, I dare say, no savage, had he
been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to venture in;
nor, indeed, would any man else, but one who, like me, wanted
nothing so much as a safe retreat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock,
where, by mere accident I would say (if I did not see abundant
reason to ascribe all such things now to Providence), I was
cutting down some thick branches of trees to make charcoal;
and before I go on, I must observe the reason of my making
this charcoal, which was thus.
I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I
said before; and yet I could not live there without baking my
bread, cooking my meat, etc. So I contrived to burn some
wood here, as I had seen done in England under turf, till it
became chark, or dry coal; and then putting the fire out, I
preserved the coal to carry home, and perform the other services
which fire was wanting for at home, without danger of smoke.
But this is by-the bye. While I was cutting down some wood
here, I perceived that behind a very thick branch of low brush-
wood, or underwood, there was a kind of hollow place. I was
curious to look into it; and getting with difficulty into the
mouth of it, I found it was pretty large ; that is to say, sufficient
for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with me.
But I must confess to you I made more haste out than I did in
when, looking farther into the place, and which was perfectly
dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some creature, whether
devil or man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars, the dim
light from the cave's mouth shining directly in, and making the
reflection.
But plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and encourag-
ing myself a little with considering that the power and presence
of God was everywhere, and was able to protect me, upon this
I stepped forward again, and by the light of a firebrand, hold-
ing it up a little over my head, I saw lying on the ground a
most monstrous, frightful, old he-goat, just making his will, as

A MOST MONSTROUS OLD HR-GOAT.
we say, and gasping for life; and dying indeed, of mere old
age.
I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he
essayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and I
thought with myself he might even lie there; for if he had
frighted me so, he would certainly fright any of the savages,
if any of them should be so hardy as to come in there while he
had any life in him.
I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look
round me, when I found the cave was but very small; that is to
say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in no manner of
shape, either round or square, no hands having ever been em-
ployed in making it but those of mere Nature. I observed also
that there was a place at the farther side of it that went in
farther, but was so low, that it required me to creep upon my
hands and knees to go into it, and whither I went I knew
not; so having no candle, I gave it over for some time, but
resolved to come again the next day, provided with candles
and a tinder-box, which I had made of the lock of one of the
muskets, with some wild-fire in the pan.
Accordingly the next day I came provided with six large
candles of my own making, for I made very good candles now
of goat's tallow; and going into this low place, I was obliged
to creep upon all fours, as I have said, almost ten yards; which,
by the way, I thought was a venture bold enough, considering
that I knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond it.
When I was got through the straight, I found the roof rose
higher up, I believe near twenty feet. But never was such a
glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to look
round the sides and roof of this vault or cave; the walls reflected
a hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles. What
it was in the rock, whether diamonds, or any other precious
stones, or gold, which I rather supposed it to be, I knew not.
The place I was in was a most delightful cavity or grotto of
its kind, as could be expected, though perfectly dark. The floor
was dry and level, and had a sort of small loose gravel upon it,
so that there was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen;
neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof. The
only difficulty in it was the entrance, which, however, as it was
a place of security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought
that was a convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at the dis-
covery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring some of those
things which I was most anxious about to this place; particularly,
I resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my
spare arms, viz., two fowling-pieces, for I had three in all, and
three muskets, for of them I had eight in all. So I kept at my
castle only five, which stood ready-mounted, like pieces of
cannon, on my outmost fence; and were ready also to take out
upon any expedition.
Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I took oc-
casion to open the barrel of powder, which I took up out of the
sea, and which had been wet; and I found that the water had
penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on every
side, which caking, and growing hard, had preserved the inside
like a kernel in a shell; so that I had near sixty pounds of
very good powder in the centre of the cask. And this was an
agreeable discovery to me at that time; so I carried all away
thither, never keeping above two or three pounds of powder
with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind. I also
carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.
1 fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which
were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none
could come at them; for I persuaded myself, while I was here,
if five hundred savages were to hunt me, they could never find
me out; or, if they did, they would not venture to attack me
here.
The old goat, whom I found expiring, died in the mouth of
the cave the next day after I made this discovery; and I found
it much easier to dig a great hole there, and throw him in and
cover him with earth, than to drag him out.
I was now in my twenty-third year of residence in this
island; and was so naturalised to the place, and to the manner
of living, that could I have but enjoyed the certainty that no
savages would come to the place to disturb me, I could have
been content to have capitulated for spending the rest of my
time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me down
and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also arrived to
some little diversions and amusements, which made the time
pass more pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before.
As, first, I had taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak; and
he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain, that
it was very pleasant to me; and he lived with me no less than
six and twenty years. How long he might live afterwards I
know not, though I know they have a notion in the Brazils that
they live a hundred years. Perhaps poor Poll may be alive
there still, calling after poor Robin Crusoe to this day. I wish
no Englishman the ill luck to come there and hear him; but if
he did, he would certainly believe it was the devil. My dog
was a very pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than
sixteen years of my time, and then died cf mere old age. As
for my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, to that degree,
that I was obliged to shoot several of them at first to keep them
from devouring me and all I had; but at length, when the two
old ones I brought with me were gone, and after some time
continually driving them from me, and letting them have no
provision with me, they all ran wild into the woods, except two
or three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose young, when
they had any, I always drowned; and these were part of my
family. Besides these, I always kept two or three household
kids about me, whom I taught to feed out of my hand. And I
had two more parrots, which talked pretty well, and would all
call " Robin Crusoe," but none like my first; nor, indeed, did I
take the pains with any of them that I had done with him. I
had also several tame sea-fowls, whose names I know not, whom
I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings; and the little
stakes which I had planted before my castle wall being now
grown up to a good thick grove, these fowls all lived among
these low trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable to
me; so that, as I said above, I began to be very well contented
with the life I led, if it might but have been secure from the
dread of the savages.
But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss for
all people who shall meet with my story, to make this just
observation from it, viz., how frequently, in the course of our
lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and which,
when we are fallen into it, is the most dreadful to us, is often-
times the very means or door of our deliverance, by which alone
we can be raised again from the affliction we are fallen into. I
could give many examples of this in the course of my unaccount-
able life; but in nothing was it more particularly remarkable,
than in the circumstances of my last years of solitary residence
in this island.
It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my
twenty-third year; and this, being the southern solstice (for
winter I cannot call it), was the particular time of my harvest,
and required my being pretty much abroad in the fields; when,
going out pretty early in the morning, even before it was
thorough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a light of some
fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two miles,
towards the end of the island, where I had observed some
savages had been, as before. But not on the other side; but,
to my great affliction, it was on my side of the island.
I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped
short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be
surprised; and yet I had no more peace within, from the appre-
hensions I had that if these savages, in rambling over the island,
should find my corn standing or cut, or any of my works and
improvements, they would immediately conclude that there
were people in the place, and would then never give over till
they had found me out. In this extremity I went back directly
to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me, and made all things
without look as wild and natural as I could.
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture
of defence. I loaded all my cannon, as I called them, that is to
say, my muskets, which were mounted upon my new fortifica-
tion, and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the
last gasp; not forgetting seriously to commend myself to the
Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver me
out of the hands of the barbarians. And in this posture I con-
tinued about two hours; but began to be mighty impatient for
intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send out.
After sitting a while longer, and musing what I should do in
this case, I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance any longer;
so setting up my ladder to the side of the hill where there was
a flat place, as I observed before, and then pulling the ladder up
after me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top of the hill;
and pulling out my perspective-glass, which I had taken on
purpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on the ground, and
began to look for the place. I presently found there was no
less than nine naked savages sitting round a small fire they had
made, not to warm them, for they had no need of that, the
weather being extreme hot, but, as I supposed, to dress some
of their barbarous diet of human flesh which they had brought
with them, whether alive or dead, I could not know.
They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up
upon the shore; and as it was then tide of ebb, they seemed to
me to wait for the return of the flood to go away again. It is
not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into,
especially seeing them come on my side of the island, and so
near me too. But when I observed their coming must be always
with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be more
sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad with
safety all the time of the tide of flood, if they were not on
shore before; and having made this observation, I went abroad
about my harvest-work with the more composure.
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made
to the westward, I saw them all take boat, and row (or paddle,
as we call it) all away. I should have observed, that for an
hour and more before they went off,they went to dancing; and
I could easily discern their postures and gestures by my glasses.
As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns
upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle, and my great
sword by my side, without a scabbard, and with all the speed
I was able to make I went away to the hill where I had dis-
covered the first appearance of all. And as soon as I gat
thither, which was not less than two hours (for I could not go
apace, being so loden with arms as I was), I perceived there had
been three canoes more of savages on that place; and looking
out farther, I saw they were all at sea together, making over for
the main.
This was a dreadful sight to me, especially when, going
down to the shore, I could see the marks of horror which the
dismal work they had been about had left behind it, viz., the
blood, the bones, and part of the flesh of human bodies, eaten
and devoured by those wretches with merriment and sport. I
was so filled with indignation at the sight, that I began now to
premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw there, let
them be who or how many soever.
However, I wore out a year and three months more before
I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I found them
again, as I shall soon observe. It is true they might have been
there once or twice, but either they made no stay, or at least I
did not hear them; but in the month of May, as near as I could
calculate, and in my four and twentieth year, I had a very
strange encounter with them; of which in its place.
The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen
months' interval, was very great. I slept unquiet, dreamed
always frightful dreams, and often started out of my sleep in the
night. In the day great troubles overwhelmed my mind, and
in the night I dreamed often of killing the savages, and of the
reasons why I might justify the doing of it. But, to waive all this
for a while, it was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth day,
I think, as well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon, for
I marked all upon the post still; 1 say, it was the sixteenth
of May that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, with a
great deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul night it
was after it. I know not what was the particular occasion of
it, but as I was reading in the Bible, and taken up with very
serious thoughts about my present condition, I was surprised
with a noise of a gun, as I thought, fired at sea.
This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite different nature
from any I had met with before; for the notions this put into
my thoughts were quite of another kind. I started up in the
greatest haste imaginable, and, in a trice, clapped my ladder to
the middle place of the rock, and pulled it after me; and
mounting it the second time, got to the top of the hill the very
moment that a flash of fire bid me listen for a second gun, which
accordingly, in about half a minute, I heard; and, by the sound,
knew that it was from that part of the sea where I was driven
down the current in my boat.
I immediately considered that this must be some ship in
distress, and that they had some comrade, or some other ship
in company, and fired these guns for signals of distress, and to
obtain help. I had this presence of mind, at that minute, as to
think that though I could not help them, it may be they might
help me; so I brought together all the dry wood I could get
at hand, and, making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon
the hill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely; and though
the wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out; so that I was
certain, if there was any such thing as a ship, they must needs
see it, and no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my fire
blazed up I heard another gun, and after that several others,
all from the same quarter. I plied my fire all night long till
day broke; and when it was broad day, and the air cleared up,
I saw something at a great distance at sea, full east of the
island, whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish, no, not
with my glasses, the distance was so great, and the weather still
something hazy also; at least it was so out at sea.
I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived
that it did not move; so I presently concluded that it was a
ship at an anchor. And being eager, you may be sure, to be
I COULD PLAINLY SEE THE WRECK OF A SHIP',
satisfied, I took my gun in my hand and ran toward the south
side of the island, to the rocks where I had formerly been
carried away with the current; and getting up there, the
weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see,
to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the night
upon those concealed rocks which I found when I was out in
my boat; and which rocks, as they checked the violence of the
stream, and made a kind of counter-stream or eddy, were the
occasion of my recovering from the most desperate, hopeless
condition that ever I had been in in all my life.
Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's destruc-
tion; for it seems these men, whoever they were, being out of
their knowledge, and the rocks being wholly under water, had
been driven upon them in the night, the wind blowing hard at
E. and E.N.E. Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily
suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have endeavoured
to have saved themselves on shore by the help of their boat;
but their firing of guns for help, especially when they saw, as I
imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts. First, I
imagined that upon seeing my light, they might have put them-
selves into their boat, and have endeavoured to make the shore;
but that the sea going very high, they might have been cast
away. Other times I imagined that they might have lost their
boat before, as might be the case many ways; as, particularly,
by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many times
obliges men to stave, or take in pieces their boat, and some-
times to throw it overboard with their own hands. Other times
I imagined they had some other ship or ships in company, who,
upon the signals of distress they had made, had taken them up
and carried them off. Other whiles I fancied they were all gone
off to sea in their boat, and being hurried away by the current
that I had been formerly in, were carried out into the great
ocean, where there was nothing but misery and perishing; and
that, perhaps, they might by this time think of starving, and of
being in a condition to eat one another.
As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition
I was in, I could do no more than look on upon the misery of
the poor men, and pity them ; which had still this good effect on
my side, that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks to
God, who had so happily and comfortably provided for me in
my desolate condition; and that of two ships' companies who
were now cast away upon this part of the world, not one life
should be spared but mine. I learned here again to observe,
that it is very rare that the providence of God casts us into any
condition of life so low, or any misery so great, but we may see
something or other to be thankful for, and may see others in
worse circumstances than our own.
I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words, what a
strange longing or hankering of desires I felt in my soul upon
this sight, breaking out sometimes thus: "Oh that there had
been but one or two, nay, or but one soul, saved out of this
ship, to have escaped to me, that I might but have had one com-
panion, one fellow-creature, to have spoken to me, and to have
conversed with!" In all the time of my solitary life, I never
felt so earnest, so strong a desire after the society of my fellow-
creatures, or so deep a regret at the want of it.
But it was not to be. Either their fate or mine, or both,
forbid it; for, till the last year of my being on this island, I
never knew whether any were saved out of that ship or no; and
had only the affliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a
drowned boy come on shore at the end of the island which was
next the shipwreck. He had on no clothes but a seaman's
waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen
shirt; but nothing to direct me so much as to guess what nation
he was of. He had nothing in his pocket but two pieces of
eight and a tobacco-pipe. The last was to me of ten times more
value than the first.
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in
my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might find something
on board that might be useful to me. But that did not alto-
gether press me so much as the possibility that there might be
yet some living creature on board, whose life I might not only
save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my own to the last
degree. And this thought clung so to my heart, that I could
not be quiet night nor day, but I must venture out in my boat on
board this wreck ; and committing the rest to God's providence,
I thought, the impression was so strong upon my mind that it
could not be resisted, that it must come from some invisible
direction, and that I should be wanting to myself if I did
not go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my
castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity of
bread, a great pot for fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle
of rum (for I had still a great deal of that left), a basket full of
raisins. And thus, loading myself with everything necessary, I
went down to my boat, got the water out of her, and got her
afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again
for more. My second cargo was a great bag full of rice, the
umbrella to set up over my head for shade, another large pot
full of fresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves, or
barley-cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's milk and
a cheese; all which, with great labour and sweat, I brought to
my boat. And praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out;
and rowing, or paddling, the canoe along the shore, I came at
last to the utmost point of the island on that side, viz., N.E.
And now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either to ven-
ture or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents which
ran constantly on both sides of the island at a distance, and
which were very terrible to me, from the remembrance of the
hazard I had been in before, and my heart began to fail me;
for I foresaw that if I was driven into either of those currents,
I should be carried a vast way out to sea, and perhaps out of
my reach, or sight of the island again; and that then, as my
boat was but small, if any little gale of wind should rise, I
should be inevitably lost.
These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give
over my enterprise; and having hauled my boat into a little
creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sate me down upon a
little rising bit of ground, very pensive and anxious, between
fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was musing, I
could perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood come on;
upon which my going was for so many hours impracticable.
Upon this, presently it occurred to me that I should go up to
the highest piece of ground I could find and observe, if I could,
how the sets of the tide, or currents, lay when the flood came in,
that I might judge whether, if I was driven one way out, I might
not expect to be driven another way home, with the same rapid-
ness of the currents. This thought was no sooner in my head
but I cast my eye upon a little hill, which sufficiently over-
looked the sea both ways, and from whence I had a clear view
of the currents, or sets of the tide, and which way I was to
guide myself in my return. Here I found, that as the current
of the ebb set out close by the south point of the island, so the
current of the flood set in close by the shore of the north side;
and that I had nothing to do but to keep to the north of the
island in my return, and I should do well enough.
Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the next
morning to set out with the first of the tide, and reposing my-
self for the night in the canoe, under the great watch-coat I
mentioned, I launched out. I made first a little out to sea, full
north, till I began to feel the benefit of the current which set
eastward, and which carried me at a great rate; and yet did
not so hurry me as the southern side current had done before,
and so as to take from me all government of the boat; but
having a strong steerage with my paddle, I went at a great rate
directly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came up to
it.
It was a dismal sight to look at. The ship, which, by its
building, was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two rocks.
All the stern and quarter of her was beaten to pieces with the
sea; and as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on
with great violence, her mainmast and foremast were brought
by the board; that is to say, broken short off; but her bowsprit
was sound, and the head and bow appeared firm. When I
came close to her a dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me
coming, yelped and cried; and as soon as I called him, jumped
into the sea to come to me, and I took him into the boat, but
found him almost dead for hunger and thirst. 1 gave him a
cake of my bread, and he ate it like a ravenous wolf that had
been starving a fortnight in the snow. I then gave the poor
creature some fresh water, with which, if I would have let him,
he would have burst himself.
After this I went on board; but the first sight I met with
was two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle of the
ship, with their arms fast about one another. I concluded, as is
indeed probable, that when the ship struck, it being in a storm,

IT WAS A DISMAL SIGHT.
the sea broke so high, and so continually over her, that the men
were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the constant
rushing in of the water, as much as if they had been under
water. Besides the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that
had life; nor any goods that I could see, but what were spoiled
by the water. There were some casks of liquor, whether wine
or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the hold, and which,
the water being ebbed out, I could see; but they were too
big to meddle with. I saw several chests, which I believed
belonged to some of the seamen; and I got two of them into
the boat, without examining what was in them.
Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the forepart
broken off, I am persuaded I might have made a good voyage;
for by what I found in these two chests, I had room to suppose
the ship had a great deal of wealth on board; and if I may
guess by the course she steered, she must have been bound
from the Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part
of America, beyond the Brazils, to the Havana, in the Gulf of
Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a great
treasure in her, but of no use, at that time, to anybody; and
what became of the rest of her people, I then knew not.
I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of
about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much
difficulty. There were several muskets in a cabin, and a great
powder-horn, with about four pounds of powder in it. As for
the muskets, I had no occasion for them, so I left them, but
took the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs, which I
wanted extremely; as also two little brass kettles, a copper pot
to make chocolate, and a gridiron. And with this cargo, and
the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home again;
and the same evening, about an hour within night, I reached
the island again, weary and fatigued to the last degree.
I reposed that night in the boat; and in the morning I
resolved to harbour what I had gotten in my new cave, not to
carry it home to my castle. After refreshing myself, I got all
my cargo on shore, and began to examine the particulars. The
cask of liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we
had at the Brazils, and, in a word, not at all good. But when
I came to open the chests, I found several things of great use
to me. For example, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of
an extraordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine, and
very good; the bottles held about three pints each, and were
tipped with silver. I found two pots of very good succades, or
sweetmeats, so fastened also on top, that the salt water had not
hurt them; and two more of the same, which the water had
spoiled. I found some very good shirts, which were very
welcome to me; and about a dozen and a half of linen white
handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths. The former were also
very welcome, being exceeding refreshing to wipe my face in a
hot day. Besides this, when I came to the till in the chest, I
found there three great bags of pieces of eight, which held out
about eleven hundred pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapped
up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small bars or
wedges of gold. I suppose they might all weigh near a pound.
The other chest I found had some clothes in it, but of little
value; but by the circumstances, it must have belonged to the
gunner's mate; though there was no powder in it, but about
two pounds of fine glazed powder, in three small flasks, kept, I
suppose, for charging their fowling-pieces on occasion. Upon
the whole, I got very little by this voyage that was of any use to
me; for as to the money, I had no manner of occasion for it;
'twas to me as the dirt under my feet; and I would have given
it all for three or four pair of English shoes and stockings,
which were things I greatly wanted, but had not had on my
feet now for many years. I had indeed gotten two pair of
shoes now, which I took off of the feet of the two drowned men
whom I saw in the wreck, and I found two pair more in one of
the chests, which were very welcome to me; but they were not
like our English shoes, either for- ease or service, being rather
what we call pumps than shoes. I found in this seaman's chest
about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no gold. I suppose
this belonged to a poorer man than the other, which seemed to
belong to some officer.
Well, however, I lugged this money home to my cave, and
laid it up, as I had done that before which I brought from our
own ship; but it was great pity, as I said, that the other part
of this ship had not come to my share, for I am satisfied I
might have loaded my canoe several times over with money,
which, if I had ever escaped to England, would have lain here
safe enough till I might have come again and fetched it.
Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured
them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along
the shore to her old harbour, where I laid her up, and made the
best of my way to my old habitation, where I found everything
safe and quiet. So I began to repose myself, live after my old
fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and, for a while, I
lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant than I used to
be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad so much; and if
at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was always to the
east part of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the
savages never came, and where I could go without so many
precautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition as I
always carried with me if I went the other way.
I lived in this condition near two years more; but my un-
lucky head, that was always to let me know it was born to
make my body miserable, was all this two years filled with
projects and designs, how, if it were possible, I might get away
from this island; for sometimes I was for making another
voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me that there was
nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage: sometimes
for a ramble one way, sometimes another; and I believe verily,
if I had had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should have
ventured to sea, bound anywhere, I knew not whither.
I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to those
who are touched with the general plague of mankind, whence,
for aught I know, one-half of their miseries flow; I mean, that
of not being satisfied with the station wherein God and Nature
has placed them.
It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the
four and twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of
solitariness. I was lying in my bed, or hammock, awake, very
well in health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of
body, no, nor any uneasiness of mind, more than ordinary, but
could by no means close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep; no,
not a wink all night long, otherwise than as follows.
It is as impossible, as needless, to set down the innumerable
crowd of thoughts that whirled through that great thoroughfare
of the brain, the memory, in this night's time. I ran over the
whole history of my life in miniature, or by abridgment, as I
may call it, to my coming to this island, and also of the part of
my life since I came to this island.
My head was for some time taken up in considering the
nature of these wretched creatures, I mean the savages, and
how it came to pass in the world that the wise Governor of all
things should give up any of His creatures to such inhumanity;
nay, to something so much below even brutality itself, as to
devour its own kind. But as this ended in some (at that time
fruitless) speculations, it occurred to me to inquire what part
of the world these wretches lived in? how far off the coast was
from whence they came? what they ventured over so far from
home for? what kind of boats they had? and why I might not
order myself and my business so, that I might be as able to go
over thither, as they were to come to me.
I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I
should do with myself when I came thither; what would be-
come of me, if I fell into the hands of the savages; or how I
should escape from them, if they attempted me; no, nor so
much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast, and not
be attempted by some or other of them, without any possibility
of delivering myself; and if I should not fall into their hands,
what I should do for provision, or whither I should bend my
course. None of these thoughts, I say, so much as came in my
way; but my mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my
passing over in my boat to the mainland. I looked back upon
my present condition as the most miserable that could possibly
be; that I was not able to throw myself into anything, but
death, that could be called worse; that if I reached the shore
of the main, I might perhaps meet with relief, or I might coast
along, as I did on the shore of Africa, till I came to some
inhabited country, and where I might find some relief; and
after all, perhaps I might fall in with some Christian ship that
might take me in; and if the worse came to the worst, I could
but die, which would put an end to all these miseries at once.
When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours, or more,
with such violence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and
my pulse beat as high as if I had been in a fever, merely with
the extraordinary fervour of my mind about it, Nature, as if I
had been fatigued and exhausted with the very thought of it,
threw me into a sound sleep. One would have thought I
should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything relat-
ing to it; but I dreamed that as I was going out in the morning,
as usual, from my castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and
eleven savages coming to land, and that they brought with them
another savage, whom they were going to kill in order to eat
him; when, on a sudden, the savage that they were going to
kill jumped away, and ran for his life. And I thought, in my
sleep, that he came running into my little thick grove before
my fortification to hide himself; and that I, seeing him alone,
and not perceiving that the other sought him that way,
showed myself to him, and smiling upon him, encouraged him;
that he kneeled down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him;
upon which I showed my ladder, made him go up, and carried
him into my cave, and he became my servant; and that as
K
soon as I had gotten this man, I said to myself, "Now I may
certainly venture to the mainland; for this fellow will serve me
as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for
provisions, and whither not to go for fear of being devoured;
what places to venture into, and what to escape." I waked
with this thought, and was under such inexpressible impressions
of joy at the prospect of my escape in my dream, that the dis-
appointments which I felt upon coming to myself and finding
it was no more than a dream were equally extravagant the other
way, and threw me into a very great dejection of spirit.
Upon this, however, I made this conclusion; that my only
way to go about an attempt for an escape was, if possible, to
get a savage into my possession; and, if possible, it should be
one of their prisoners whom they had condemned to be eaten,
and should bring thither to kill. But these thoughts still were
attended with this difficulty, that it was impossible to effect this
without attacking a whole caravan of them, and killing them
all; and this was not only a very desperate attempt, and might
miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the law-
fulness of it to me; and my heart trembled at the thoughts of
shedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance. I
need not repeat the arguments which occurred to me against
this, they being the same mentioned before. But though I had
other reasons to offer now, viz., that those men were enemies to
my life, and would devour me if they could; that it was self-
preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself from this
death of a life, and was acting in my own defence as much as if
they were actually assaulting me, and the like; I say, though
these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human
blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me, and such as
I could by no means reconcile myself to a great while.
However, at last, after many secret disputes with myself,
and after great perplexities about it, for all these arguments,
one way and another, struggled in my head a long time, the
eager prevailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all the
rest, and I resolved, if possible, to get one of those savages into
my hands, cost what it would. My next thing then was to con-
trive how to do it, and this indeed was very difficult to resolve
on. But as I could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I
resolved to put myself upon the watch, to see them when they
came on shore, and leave the rest to the event, taking such
measures as the opportunity should present, let be what would
be.
With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the
scout as often as possible, and indeed so often, till I was heartily
tired of it; for it was above a year and half that I waited; and
for great part of that time went out to the west end, and to
the south-west corner of the island, almost every day, to see for
canoes, but none appeared. This was very discouraging, and
began to trouble me much; though I cannot say that it did in
this case, as it had done some time before that, viz., wear off
the edge of my desire to the thing. But the longer it seemed
to be delayed, the more eager I was for it. In a word, I was
not at first so careful to shun the sight of these savages, and
avoid being seen by them, as I was now eager to be upon them.
Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two or
three savages, if I had them, so as to make them entirely slaves
to me, to do whatever I should direct them, and to prevent their
being able at any time to do me any hurt. It was a great while
that I pleased myself with this affair; but nothing still pre-
sented. All my fancies and schemes came to nothing, for no
savages came near me for a great while.
About a year and half after I had entertained these notions,
and by long musing had, as it were, resolved them all into
nothing, for want of an occasion to put them in execution, I
was surprised, one morning early, with seeing no less than five
canoes all on shore together on my side the island, and the
people who belonged to them all landed, and out of my sight.
The number of them broke all my measures; for seeing so
many, and knowing that they always came four, or six, or some-
times more, in a boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or
how to take my measures to attack twenty or thirty men single-
handed; so I lay still in my castle, perplexed and discomforted.
However, I put myself into all the same postures for an attack
that I had formerly provided, and was just ready for action if
anything had presented. Having waited a good while, listening
to hear if they made any noise, at length, being very impatient,
I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the
top of the hill, by my two stages, as usual; standing so, how-
ever, that my head did not appear above the hill, so that they
could not perceive me by any means. Here I observed, by the
help of my perspective glass, that they were no less than thirty
in number, that they had a fire kindled, that they had had meat
dressed. How they had cooked it, that I knew not, or what it
was; but they were all dancing, in I know not how many
barbarous gestures and figures, their own way, round the fire.
While I was thus looking on them, I perceived by my
perspective two miserable wretches dragged from the boats,
where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now brought out
for the slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately fell,
being knocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden sword,
for that was their way, and two or three others were at work
immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while the other
victim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for
him. In that very moment this poor wretch seeing himself a
little at liberty, Nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he
started away from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along
the sands directly towards me, I mean towards that part of the
coast where my habitation was.
I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowledge) when I
perceived him to run my way, and especially when, as I thought,
I saw him pursued by the whole body; and now I expected
that part of my dream was coming to pass, and that he would
certainly take shelter in my grove; but I could not depend, by
any means, upon my dream for the rest of it, viz., that the other
savages would not pursue him thither, and find him there.
However, I kept my station, and my spirits began to recover
when I found that there was not above three men that followed
him; and still more was I encouraged when I found that he
outstripped them exceedingly in running, and gained ground
of them; so that if he could but hold it for half-an-hour, I saw
easily he would fairly get away from them all.
There was between them and my castle the creek, which I
mentioned often at the first part of my story, when I landed my
cargoes out of the ship; and this I saw plainly he must neces-
sarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken there. But
when the savage escaping came thither he made nothing of it,
"KILLED H1A\ AT THE FIRST SHOT."
though the tide was then up; but plunging in, swam through
in about thirty strokes or thereabouts, landed, and ran on with
exceeding strength and swiftness. When the three persons
came to the creek, I found that two of them could swim, but the
third could not, and that, standing on the other side, he looked
at the other, but went no further, and soon after went softly
back, which, as it happened, was very well for him in the main.
I observed, that the two who swam were yet more than twice
as long swimming over the creek as the fellow was that fled
from them. It came now very warmly upon my thoughts, and
indeed irresistibly, that now was my time to get me a servant,
and perhaps a companion or assistant, and that I was called
plainly by Providence to save this poor creature's life. I im-
mediately run down the ladders with all possible expedition,
fetched my two guns, for they were both but at the foot of the
ladders, as I observed above, and getting up again, with the
same haste, to the top of the hill, I crossed toward the sea, and
having a very short cut, and all down hill, clapped myself in
the way between the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud
to him that fled, who, looking back, was at first perhaps as
much frighted at me as at them ; but I beckoned with my
hand to him to come back; and, in the meantime, I slowly ad-
vanced towards the two that followed; then rushing at once
upon the foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of my
piece. I was loth to fire, because I would not have the rest
hear; though, at that distance, it would not have been easily
heard, and being out of sight of the smoke too, they would not
have easily known what to make of it. Having knocked this
fellow down, the other who pursued with him stopped, as if he
had been frighted, and I advanced apace towards him ; but as
I came nearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow,
and was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then necessitated to
shoot at him first, which I did, and killed him at the first shot.
The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw
both his enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was so
frighted with the fire and noise of my piece, that he stood stock-
still, and neither came forward or went backward, though he
seemed rather inclined to fly still, than to come on. I hallooed
again to him, and made signs to come forward, which he easily
understood, and came a little way, then stopped again, and
then a little further, and stopped again; and I could then per-
ceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner,
and had just been to be killed, as his two enemies were. I
beckoned him asjain to come to me, and gave him all the signs
of encouragement that I could think of; and he came nearer
and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token
of acknowledgment for my saving his life. I smiled at him,
and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still
nearer. At length he came close to me, and then he kneeled
down again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon the
ground, and taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head.
This, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my slave for
ever. I took him up, and made much of him, and encouraged
him all I could. But there was more work to do yet; for I
perceived the savage whom I knocked down was not killed, but
stunned with the blow, and began to come to himself; so I
pointed to him, and showing him the savage, that he was not
dead, upon this he spoke some words to me; and though I
could not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant
to hear; for they were the first sound of a man's voice that I
had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty-five years. But
there was no time for such reflections now. The savage who
was knocked down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon
the ground, and I perceived that my savage began to be afraid;
but when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the man, as
if I would shoot him. Upon this my savage, for so I call him
now, made a motion to me to lend him my sword, which hung
naked in a belt by my side; so I did. He no sooner had it
but he runs to his enemy, and, at one blow, cut off his head as
cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done it sooner
or better; which I thought very strange for one who, I had
reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except
their own wooden swords. However, it seems, as I learned
afterwards, they make their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy,
and the wood is so hard, that they will cut off heads even with
them, ay, and arms, and that at one blow too. When he had
done this, he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, and
brought me the sword again, and with abundance of gestures,
which I did not understand, laid it down, with the head of the
savage that he had killed, just before me.
But that which astonished him most, was to know how I had
killed the other Indian so far off; so pointing to him, he made
signs to me to let him go to him; so I bade him go, as well as
I could. When he came to him, he stood like one amazed,
looking at him, turned him first on one side, then on t'other,
looked at the wound the bullet had made, which, it seems, was
just in his breast, where it had made a hole, and no great
quantity of blood had followed; but he had bled inwardly, for
he was quite dead. He took up his bow and arrows, and came
back; so I turned to go away, and beckoned to him to follow
me, making signs to him that more might come after them.
Upon this he signed to me that he should bury them with
sand, that they might not be seen by the rest if they followed;
and so I made signs again to him to do so. He fell to work,
and in an instant he had scraped a hole in the sand with his
hands big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him
into it, and covered him, and did so also by the other. I believe
he had buried them both in a quarter of an hour. Then calling
him away, I carried him, not to my castle, but quite away to my
cave, on the farther part of the island ; so I did not let my
dream come to pass in that part, viz., that he came into my
grove for shelter.
Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a
draught of water, which I found he was indeed in great distress
for, by his running; and having refreshed him, I made signs for
him to go lie down and sleep, pointing to a place where I had
laid a great parcel of rice-straw, and a blanket upon it, which I
used to sleep upon myself sometimes ; so the poor creature laid
down, and went to sleep.
He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made,
with straight strong limbs, not too large, tall, and well-shaped,
and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had a
very good countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed
to have something very manly in his face; and yet he had all
the sweetness and softness of an European in his countenance
too, especially when he smiled. His hair was long and black,
not curled like wool; his forehead very high and large; and a
great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour
of his skin was not quite black, but very tawny; and yet not of
an ugly,yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Virginians,
and other natives of America are, but of a bright kind of a dun
olive colour, that had in it something very agreeable, though
not very easy to describe. His face was round and plump; his
nose small, not flat like the negroes; a very good mouth, thin
lips, and his fine teeth well set, and white as ivory.
After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half-an-
hour, he waked again, and comes out of the cave to me, for I
had been milking my goats, which I had in the enclosure just
by. When he espied me, he came running to me, laying him-
self down again upon the ground, with all the possible signs of
an humble, thankful disposition, making a many antic gestures
to show it. At last he lays his head flat upon the ground, close
to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his head, as he had
done before, and after this made all the signs to me of subjec-
tion, servitude, and submission imaginable, to let me know how he
would serve me as long as he lived. I understood him in many
things, and let him know I was very well pleased with him. In
a little time I began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to
me; and, first, I made him know his name should be Friday,
which was the day I saved his life. I called him so for the
memory of the time. I likewise taught him to say master, and
then let him know that was to be my name. I likewise taught
him to say Yes and No, and to know the meaning of them. I
gave him some milk in an earthen pot, and let him see me
drink it before him, and sop my bread in it; and I gave him a
cake of bread to do the like, which he quickly complied with,
and made signs that it was very good for him.
I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as it was
day, I beckoned to him to come with me, and let him know I
would give him some clothes; at which he seemed very glad,
for he was stark naked. As we went by the place where he had
buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the place, and showed
me the marks that he had made to find them again, making
signs to me that we should dig them up again, and eat them.
At this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it,
made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned
with my hand to him to come away; which he did immediately,
with great submission. I then led him up to the top of the hill,
to see if his enemies were gone; and pulling out my glass, I
looked, and saw plainly the place where they had been, but no
appearance of them or of their canoes; so that it was plain that
they were gone, and had left their two comrades behind them,
without any search after them.
But I was not content with this discovery; but having now
more courage, and consequently more curiosity, I takes my man
Friday with me, giving him the sword in his hand, with the bow
and arrows at his back, which I found he could use very dexter-
ously, making him carry one gun for me, and I two lor myself,
and away we marched to the place where these creatures had
been; for I had a mind now to get some fuller intelligence of
them. When I came to the place, my very blood ran chill in
my veins, and my heart sunk within me, at the horror of the
spectacle. Indeed, it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to
me, though Friday made nothing of it. The place was covered
with human bones, the ground dyed with their blood, great
pieces of flesh left here and there, half-eaten, mangled, and
scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of the triumphant feast
they had been making there, after a victory over their enemies.
I saw three skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four
legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies; and
Friday, by his signs, made me understand that they brought
over four prisoners to feast upon; that three of them were eaten
up, and that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth; that there
had been a great battle between them and their next king,
whose subjects it seems he had been one of, and that they had
taken a great number of prisoners; all which were carried to
several places by those that had taken them in the fight, in
order to feast upon them, as was done here by these wretches
upon those they brought hither.
I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and
whatever remained, and lay them together on a heap, and make
a great fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday
had still a hankering stomach after some of the flesh, and was
stilla cannibal in his nature; but I discovered so much abhorrence
at the very thoughts of it, and at the least appearance of it, that
he durst not discover it; for I had, by some means, let him
know that I would kill him if he offered it.
When we had done this we came back to our castle, and
there I fell to work for my man Friday; and, first of all, I gave
him a pair of linen drawers, which I had out of the poor gunner's
chest I mentioned, and which I found in the wreck; and which,
with a little alteration, fitted him very well. Then I made him
a jerkin of goat's-skin, as well as my skill would allow, and I
was now grown a tolerable good tailor; and I gave him a cap,
which I had made of a hare-skin, very convenient and fashion-
able enough ; and thus he was clothed for the present tolerably
well, and was mighty well pleased to see himself almost as well
clothed as his master. It is true he went awkwardly in these
things at first; wearing the drawers was very awkward to him,
and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his shoulders, and the
inside of his arms; but a little easing them where he complained
they hurt him, and using himself to them, at length he took to
them very well.
The next day after I came home to my hutch with him, I
began to consider where I should lodge him. And that I might
do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little
tent for him in the vacant place between my two fortifications,
in the inside of the last and in the outside of the first; and as
there was a door or entrance there into my cave, I made a
formal framed door-case, and a door to it of boards, and set it
up in the passage, a little within the entrance; and causing the
door to open on the inside, I barred it up in the night, taking
in my ladders too; so that Friday could no way come at me
in the inside of my innermost wall without making so much
noise in getting over, that it must needs waken me; for my first
wall had now a complete roof over it of long poles, covering
all my tent, and leaning up to the side of the hill, which was
again laid cross with smaller sticks instead of laths, and then
thatched over a great thickness with the rice-straw, which was
strong, like reeds; and at the hole or place which was left to go
in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap-door, which,
if it had been attempted on the outside, would not have opened
at all, but would have fallen down, and made a great noise; and
as to weapons, I took them all into my side every night.
But I needed none of all this precaution; for never man had
a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me;
without passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and
engaged; his very affections were tied to me, like those of a
child to a father; and I dare say he would have sacrificed his
life for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever. The
many testimonies he gave me of this put it out of doubt, and
soon convinced me that I needed to use no precautions as to
my safety on his account.
This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with
wonder, that however it had pleased God, in His providence, and
in the government of the works of His hands, to take from so
great a part of the world of His creatures the best uses to which
their faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted, yet that
He has bestowed upon them the same powers, the same reason,
the same affections, the same sentiments of kindness and obliga-
tion, the same passions and resentments of wrongs, the same
sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities of
doing good, and receiving good, that He has given to us; and
that when He pleases to offer to them occasions of exerting
these, they are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the
right uses for which they were bestowed than we are.
But to return to my new companion. I was greatly delighted
with him, and made it my business to teach him everything that
was proper to make him useful, handy, and helpful; but
especially to make him speak, and understand me when I spake.
And he was the aptest scholar that ever was; and particularly
was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased when he
could but understand me, or make me understand him, that it
was very pleasant to me to talk to him. And now my life
began to be so easy, that I began to say to myself, that could I
but have been safe from more savages, I cared not if I was
never to remove from the place while I lived.
After I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I
thought that, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way
of feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought
to let him taste other flesh; so I took him out with me one
morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid
out of my own flock, and bring him home and dress it; but as

HE STOOD LIKE ONE FRIGHTED.
I was going, I saw a she-goat lying down in the shade, and two
young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday. "Hold,"
says I, "stand still," and made signs to him not to stir. Im-
mediately I presented my piece, shot and killed one of the kids.
The poor creature, who had, at a distance indeed, seen me kill
the savage, his enemy, but did not know, or could imagine, how
it was done, was sensibly surprised, trembled and shook, and
looked so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk down.
He did not see the kid I had shot at, or perceive I had killed it,
but ripped up his waistcoat to feel if he was not wounded; and,
as I found presently, thought I was resolved to kill him; for he
came and kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees, said a
great many things I did not understand; but I could easily see
that the meaning was to pray me not to kill him.
I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no
harm; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and
pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned to him to run
and fetch it, which he did; and while he was wondering, and
looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun
again; and by-and-by I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sit upon
a tree, within shot; so, to let Friday understand a little what I
would do, I called him to me again, pointing at the fowl, which
was indeed a parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk; I
say, pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground
under the parrot, to let him see 1 would make it fall, I made
him understand that I would shoot and kill that bird. Accord-
ingly I fired, and bade him look, and immediately he saw the
parrot fall. He stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding
all I had said to him; and I found he was the more amazed,
because he did not see me put anything into the gun, but
thought that there must be some wonderful fund of death and
destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or any-
thing near or far off; and the astonishment this created in him
was such as could not wear off for a long time; and I believe,
if I would have let him, he would have worshipped me and my
gun. As for the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it
for several days after; but would speak to it, and talk to it, as
if it had answered him, when he was by himself; which, as I
afterwards learned of him, was to desire it not to kill him.
Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I
pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he
did, but stayed some time; for the parrot, not being quite dead,
was fluttered a good way off from the place where she fell.
However, he found her, took her up, and brought her to me;
and as I had perceived his ignorance about the gun before, I
took this advantage to charge the gun again, and not let him see
me do it, that I might be ready for any other mark that might
present. But nothing more offered at that time; so I brought
home the kid, and the same evening I took the skin off, and cut
it out as well as I could; and having a pot for that purpose, I
boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some very good
broth; and after I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my
man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well; but
that which was strangest to him, was to see me eat salt with
it. He made a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat,
and putting a little into his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate
it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth with
fresh water after it. On the other hand, I took some meat in
my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for
want of salt, as fast as he had done at the salt. But it would
not do; he would never care for salt with his meat or in his
broth; at least, not a great while, and then but a very little.
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was
resolved to feast him the next day with roasting a piece of the
kid. This I did by hanging it before the fire in a string, as
I had seen many people do in England, setting two poles up,
one on each side of the fire, and one cross on the top, and tying
the string to the cross stick, letting the meat turn continually.
This Friday admired very much. But when he came to taste
the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked it,
that I could not but understand him; and at last he told me he
would never eat man's flesh any more, which I was very glad to
hear.
The next day I set him to work to beating some corn out,
and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I observed before;
and he soon understood how to do it as well as I, especially
after he had seen what the meaning of it was, and that it was
to make bread of; for after that I let him see me make my
bread, and bake it too; and in a little time Friday was able to
do all the work for me, as well as I could do it myself.
I began now to consider that, having two mouths to feed
instead of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and
plant a larger quantity of corn than I used to do; so I marked
out a larger piece of land, and began the fence in the same
manner as before, in which Friday not only worked very will-
ingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully; and I told him
what it was for; that it was for corn to make more bread,
because he was now with me, and that I might have enough for
him and myself too. He appeared very sensible of that part,
and let me know that he thought I had much more labour upon
me on his account, than I had for myself; and that he would
work the harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.
This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this
place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the
names of almost everything I had occasion to call for, and of
every place I had to send him to, and talk a great deal to me;
so that, in short, I began now to have some use for my tongue
again, which, indeed, I had very little occasion for before, that
is to say, about speech. Besides the pleasure of talking to him,
I had a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself. His simple,
unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and more every day,
and I began really to love the creature; and, on his side, I
believe he loved me more than it was possible for him ever to
love anything before.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination
to his own country again; and having learned him English so
well that he could answer me almost any questions, I asked
him whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered in
battle? At which he smiled, and said, "Yes, yes, we always
fight the better ;" that is, he meant, always get the better in
fight; and so we began the following discourse: "You always
fight the better," said I. "How came you to be taken prisoner
then, Friday?"
Friday. My nation beat much for all that.
Master. How beat? If your nation beat them, how came
you to be taken?
Friday. They more many than my nation in the place where
me was; they take one, two, three, and me. My nation over-
beat them in the yonder place, where me no was; there my
nation take one, two, great thousand.
Master. But why did not your side recover you from the
hands of your enemies then?
Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and make go in
the canoe; my nation have no canoe that time.
Master. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with
the men they take? Do they carry them away and eat them,
as these did?
Friday. Yes, my nation eats mans too; eat all up.
Master. Where do they carry them?
Friday. Go to other place, where they think.
Master. Do they come hither?
Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else place.
Master. Have you been here with them?
Friday. Yes, I been here. (Points to the N. W. side of the
island, which, it seems, was their side.)
By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly
been among the savages who used to come on shore on the
farther part of the island, on the same man-eating occasions
that he was now brought for; and, some time after, when I
took the courage to carry him to that side, being the same I
formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told me
he was there once when they eat up twenty men, two women,
and one child. He could not tell twenty in English, but he
numbered them by laying so many stones on a row, and point-
ing to me to tell them over.
I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows;
that after I had had this discourse with him, I asked him
how far it was from our island to the shore, and whether the
canoes were not often lost. He told me there was no danger,
no canoes ever lost; but that, after a little way out to the sea,
there was a current and a wind, always one way in the morning,
the other in the afternoon.
This I understood to be no more than the sets of the tide,
as going out or coming in; but I afterwards understood it was
occasioned by the great draught and reflux of the mighty river
Oroonoko, in the mouth of the gulf of which river, as I found
afterwards, our island lay; and this land which I perceived to the
W. and NW. was the great island Trinidad, on the north point of
the mouth of the river. I asked Friday a thousand questions
about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and what
nations were near. He told me all he knew, with the greatest
openness imaginable. I asked him the names of the several
nations of his sort of people, but could get no other name than
Caribs; from whence I easily understood that these were the
Caribbees, which our maps place on the part of America which
reaches from the mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guiana, and
onwards to St Martha. He told me that up a great way beyond
the moon, that was, beyond the setting of the moon, which
must be W. from their country, there dwelt white-bearded men,
like me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned
before; and that they had killed much mans, that was his
word; by all which I understood he meant the Spaniards,
whose cruelties in America had been spread over the whole
countries, and was remembered by all the nations from father
to son.
I inquired if he could tell me how I might come from this
island and get among those white men. He told me, "Yes,
yes, I might go in two canoe." I could not understand what
he meant, or make him describe to me what he meant by two
canoe; till at last, with great difficulty, I found he meant it
must be in a large great boat, as big as two canoes.
This part of Friday's discourse began to relish with me very
well; and from this time I entertained some hopes that, one
time or other, I might find an opportunity to make my escape
from this place, and that this poor savage might be a means to
help me to do it.
During the long time that Friday had now been with me,
and that he began to speak to me, and understand me, I was
not wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his
mind; particularly I asked him one time, Who made him?
The poor creature did not understand me at all, so I took it by
another handle, and asked him who made the sea, the ground
we walked on, and the hills and woods? He told me it was
one old Benamuckee, that lived beyond all. He could describe
nothing of this great person, but that he was very old, much
older, he said, than the sea or the land, than the moon or the
stars. I asked him then, if this old person had made all things,
why did not all things worship him? He looked very grave,
and with a perfect look of innocence said, " All things do say
O to him." I asked him if the people who die in his country
went away anywhere? He said, "Yes, they all went to
Benamuckee." Then I asked him whether these they eat up
went thither too? He said "Yes."
From these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge
of the true God. I told him that the great Maker of all things
lived up there, pointing up towards heaven; that He governs
the world by the same power and providence by which He had
made it; that He was omnipotent, could do everything for us,
give everything to us, take everything from us; and thus, by
degree?, I opened his eyes. He listened with great attention,
and received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being sent
to redeem us, and of the manner of making our prayers to God,
and His being able to hear us, even into heaven. He told me
one day that if our God could hear us up beyond the sun, He must
needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived but
a little way off, and yet could not hear till they went up to the
great mountains where he dwelt to speak to him. I asked him
if he ever went thither to speak to him? He said, No; they
L
never went that were young men; none went thither but the
old men, whom he called their Oowokakee, that is, as I made
him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy; and that they
went to say O (so he called saying prayers), and then came
back, and told them what Benamuckee said. By this I observed
that there is priestcraft even amongst the most blinded, ignorant
pagans in the world; and the policy of making a secret religion
in order to preserve the veneration of the people to the clergy
is not only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps among all
religions in the world, even among the most brutish and barbar-
ous savages.
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday, and
told him that the pretence of their old men going up to the
mountains to say O to their god Benamuckee was a cheat, and
their bringing word from thence what he said was much more
so; that if they met with any answer, or spoke with any one
there, it must be with an evil spirit; and then I entered into a
long discourse with him about the devil, the original of him, his
rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his
setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to be worshipped
instead of God, and as God, and the many stratagems he made
use of to delude mankind to their ruin; how he had a secret
access to our passions and to our affections, to adapt his snares
so to our inclinations, as to cause us even to be our own tempters,
and to run upon our destruction by our own choice.
I had been telling him how the devil was God's enemy in
the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill to defeat the
good designs of Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ
in the world, and the like. "Well," says Friday, "but you say-
God is so strong, so great; is He not much strong, much might
as the devil?" "Yes, yes," says I, "Friday, God is stronger
than the devil; God is above the devil, and therefore we pray
to God to tread him down under our feet, and enable us to resist
his temptations, and quench his fiery darts." "But," says he
again, " if God much strong, much might as the devil, why God
no kill the devil, so make him no more do wicked?"
I was strangely surprised at his question; and after all,
though I was now an old man, yet I was but a young doctor,
and ill enough qualified for a casuist, or a solver of difficulties;
and at first I could not tell what to say; so I pretended not to
hear him, and asked him what he said? But he was too earnest
for an answer to forget his question, so that he repeated it in
the very same broken words as above. By this time I had
recovered myself a little, and I said, "God will at last punish
him severely; he is reserved for the judgment, and is to be cast
into the bottomless pit, to dwell with everlasting fire." This
did not satisfy Friday; but he returns upon me, repeating my
words, "Reserve at last! me no understand; but why not kill
the devil now? not kill great ago?" "You may as well ask me,"
said I, "why God does not kill you and I, when we do wicked
things here that offend Him; we are preserved to repent and
be pardoned." He muses awhile at this. "Well, well," says
he, mighty affectionately, " that well; so you, I, devil, all wicked,
all preserve, repent, God pardon all."
I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and
my man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of
going out; then sending him for something a good way off, I
seriously prayed to God that He would enable me to instruct
savingly this poor savage, and would guide me to speak so to
him from the Word of God as his conscience might be convinced,
his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When he came again to
me, I entered into a long discourse with him upon the subject
of the redemption of man by the Saviour of the world, and of
the doctrine of the Gospel preached from heaven, viz., of repent-
ance towards God, and faith in our blessed Lord Jesus. I then
explained to him as well as I could why our blessed Redeemer
took not on Him the nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham;
and how, for that reason, the fallen angels had no share in the
redemption; that He came only to the lost sheep of the house
of Israel, and the like.
In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder of my
time, and the conversation which employed the hours between
Friday and I was such as made the three years which we lived
there together perfectly and completely happy, if any such
thing as complete happiness can be formed in a sublunary state.
The savage was now a good Christian, a much better than I;
though I have reason to hope, and bless God for it, that we
were equally penitent, and comforted, restored penitents. We
had here the Word of God to read, and no farther off from His
Spirit to instruct than if we had been in England.
As to all the disputes, wranglings, strife, and contention
which has happened in the world about religion, whether niceties
in doctrines, or schemes of Church government, they were all
perfectly useless to us; as, for aught I can yet see, they have
been to all the rest in the world. We had the sure guide to
heaven, viz., the Word of God; and we had, blessed be God,
comfortable views of the Spirit of God teaching and instructing
us bv His Word, leading us into all truth, and making us both
willing and obedient to the instruction of His Word; and I
cannot see the least use that the greatest knowledge of the dis-
puted points in religion, which have made such confusions in
the world, would have been to us if we could have obtained it.
But I must go on with the historical part of things, and take
every part in its order.
After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and
that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak
fluently, though in broken English, to me, I acquainted him
with my own story, or at least so much of it as related to my
coming into the place; how I had lived there, and how long. I
let him into the mystery, for such it was to him, of gunpowder
and bullet, and taught him how to shoot; I gave him a knife,
which he was wonderfully delighted with, and I made him a
belt, with a frog hanging to it, such as in England we wear
hangers in ; and in the frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him a
hatchet, which was not only as good a weapon, in some cases,
but much more useful upon other occasions.
I described to him the country of Europe, and particularly
England, which I came from ; how we lived, how we worshipped
God, how we behaved to one another, and how we traded in
ships to all parts of the world. I gave him an account of the
wreck which I had been on board of, and showed him, as near
as I could, the place where she lay; but she was all beaten in
pieces before, and gone.
I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we
escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole strength
then, but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this
boat, Friday stood musing a great while, and said nothing. I

STOOD MUSING A GREAT WHILE.
asked him what it was he studied upon. At last says he, " Me
see such boat like come to place at my nation."
I did not understand him a good while; but at last, when I
had examined further into it, I understood by him that a boat
such as that had been, came on shore upon the country where
he lived; that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress
of weather. I presently imagined that some European ship
must have been cast away upon their coast, and the boat might
get loose and drive ashore; but was so dull, that I never once
thought of men making escape from a wreck thither, much less
whence they might come; so I only inquired after a description
of the boat.
Friday described the boat to me well enough; but brought
me better to understand him when he added with some warmth,
"We save the white mans from drown." Then I presently
asked him if there was any white mans, as he called them, in
the boat. "Yes," he said, "the boat full of white mans." I
asked him how many. He told upon his fingers seventeen. I
asked him then what became of them. He told me, "They
live, they dwell at my nation."
This put new thoughts into my head; for I presently
imagined that these might be the men belonging to the ship
that was cast away in sight of my island, as I now call it; and
who, after the ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her
inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat, and were
landed upon that wild shore among the savages.
Upon this I inquired of him more critically what was be-
come of them. He assured me they lived still there; that they
had been there about four years; that the savages let them
alone, and gave them victuals to live. I asked him how it came
to pass they did not kill them, and eat them. He said," No,
they make brother with them "; that is, as I understood him, a
truce; and then he added, " They no eat mans but when make
the war fight"; that is to say, they never eat any men but such
as come to fight with them and are taken in battle.
It was after this some considerable time, that being on the
top of the hill, at the east side of the island (from whence, as I
have said, I had in a clear day discovered the main or continent
of America), Friday, the weather being very serene, looks very
earnestly towards the mainland, and, in a kind of surprise, falls
a-jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some
distance from him. I asked him what was the matter? "O
joy!" says he," O glad ! there see my country, there my nation!"
I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in
his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered
a strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his own country
again; and this observation of mine put a great many thoughts
into me, which made me at first not so easy about my new man
Friday as I was before; and I made no doubt but that if Friday
could get back to his own nation again, he would not only
forget all his religion, but all his obligation to me; and would
be forward enough to give his countrymen an account of me,
and come back perhaps with a hundred or two of them, and
make a feast upon me, at which he might be as merry as he
used to be with those of his enemies, when they were taken in
war.
But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for
which I was very sorry afterwards. However, as my jealousy
increased, and held me some weeks, I was a little more circum-
spect, and not so familiar and kind to him as before; in which I
was certainly in the wrong too, the honest, grateful creature
having no thought about it but what consisted with the best
principles, both as a religious Christian and as a grateful friend,
as appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction.
While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was
every day pumping him, to see if he would discover any of the
new thoughts which I suspected were in him; but I found
everything he said was so honest and so innocent, that I could
find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite of all my
uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his own again, nor did
he in the least perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore I
could not suspect him of deceit.
One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being
hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I called to
him, and said, " Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own
country, your own nation?" "Yes," he said, "I be much O
glad to be at my own nation." "What would you do there?"
said I. "Would you turn wild again, eat men's flesh again, and
be a savage as you were before?" He looked full of concern,
and shaking his head said, "No, no; Friday tell them to live
good; tell them to pray God; tell them to eat corn-bread,
cattle-flesh, milk, no eat man again." "Why then," said I to
him, "they will kill you." He looked grave at that, and then
said, " No, they no kill me, they willing love learn." He meant
by this they would be willing to learn. He added, they learned
much of the bearded mans that come in the boat. Then I asked
him if he would go back to them? He smiled at that, and told
me he could not swim so far. I told him I would make a canoe
for him. He told me he would go, if I would go with him. "I
go! "says I; "why, they will eat me if I come there." "No,
no," says he, " me make they no eat you; me make they much
love you." He meant, he would tell them how I had killed his
enemies, and saved his life, and so he would make them love
me. Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind they were
to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he called them, who
came on shore there in distress.
From this time I confess I had a mind to venture over, and
see if I could possibly join with these bearded men, who, I made
no doubt, were Spaniards or Portuguese; not doubting but, if I
could, we might find some method to escape from thence, being
upon the continent, and a good company together, better than
I could from an island forty miles off the shore, and alone,
without help. So, after some days, I took Friday to work
again, by way of discourse, and told him I would give him a
boat to go back to his own nation; and accordingly I carried
him to my frigate, which lay on the other side of the island, and
having cleared it of water, for I always kept it sunk in the
water, I brought it out, showed it him, and we both went into it.
I found he was a most dexterous fellow at managing it,
would make it go almost as swift and fast again as I could. So
when he was in I said to him, "Well now, Friday, shall we go
to your nation?" He looked very dull at my saying so, which,
it seems, was because he thought the boat too small to go so
far. I told him then I had a bigger; so the next day I went to
the place where the first boat lay which I had made, but which
I could not get into water. He said that was big enough; but
then, as I had taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three
and twenty years there, the sun had split and dried it, that it
was in a manner rotten. Friday told me such a boat would do
very well, and would carry" much enough victual, drink, bread ";
that was his way of talking.
Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design
of going over with him to the continent, that I told him we
would go and make one as big as that, and he should go home in
it. He answered not one word, but looked very grave and sad.
I asked him what was the matter with him? He asked me
again thus," Why you angry mad with Friday ? what me done?"
I asked him what he meant. I told him I was not angry with
him at all. "No angry! no angry!" says he, repeating the
words several times. "Why send Friday home away to my
nation?" "Why," says I, "Friday, did you not say you wished
you were there?" "Yes, yes," says he, " wish be both there, no
wish Friday there, no master there." In a word, he would not
think of going there without me. "I go there, Friday?" says
I; "what shall I do there?" He turned very quick upon me
at this: "You do great deal much good," says he; "you teach
wild mans to be good, sober, tame mans; you tell them know
God, pray God, and live new life." "Alas! Friday," says I,
"thou knowest not what thou sayest. I am but an ignorant
man myself." "Yes, yes," says he, "you teachee me good, you
teachee them good." "No, no, Friday," says I, "you shall go
without me; leave me here to live by myself, as I did before."
He looked confused again at that word, and running to one of
the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily,
comes and gives it me. "What must I do with this?" says I
to him. "You take kill Friday," said he. "What must I kill
you for?" said I again. He returns very quick, "What you
send Friday away for? Take kill Friday, no send Friday
away." This he spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears stand in
his eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost affection
in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that I told him then,
and often after, that I would never send him away from me if
he was willing to stay with me.
Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled
affection to me, and that nothing should part him from me, so I
found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country
was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of
my doing them good; a thing which, as I had no notion of my-
self, so I had not the least thought or intention or desire of
undertaking it. But still I found a strong inclination to my
attempting an escape, as above, founded on the supposition
gathered from the discourse, viz., that there were seventeen
bearded men there; and, therefore, without any more delay I
went to work with Friday to find out a great tree proper to fell,
and make a large periagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage,
There were trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet,
not viperiaguas and canoes, but even of good large vessels. But
the main thing I looked at was, to get one so near the water
that we might launch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake
I committed at first.
At last Friday pitched upon a tree, for I found he knew
much better than I what kind of wood was fittest for it; nor
can I tell, to this day, what wood to call the tree we cut down,
except that it was very like the tree we call fustic, or between
that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same
colour and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow or cavity

INCH BY INCH, UPON GREAT ROLLERS.
of this tree out, to make it for a boat, but I showed him how
rather to cut it out with tools; which, after 1 had showed him
how to use, he did very handily; and in about a month's hard
labour we finished it, and made it very handsome; especially
when, with our axes, which I showed him how to handle, we cut
and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat. After
this, however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to get her along,
as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers into the water; but
when she was in, she would have carried twenty men with great
ease.
When she was in the water, and though she was so big, it
amazed me to see with what dexterity, and how swift my man
Friday would manage her, turn her, and paddle her along. So
I asked him if he would, and if we might venture over in her.
"Yes," he said, "he venture over in her very well, though great
blow wind." However, I had a farther design that he knew
nothing of, and that was to make a mast and sail, and to fit her
with an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough
to get; so I pitched upon a straight young cedar tree, which I
found near the place, and which there was great plenty of in the
island; and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave him
directions how to shape and order it. But as to the sail, that
was my particular care. I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces
of old sails enough ; but as I had had them now twenty-six
years by me, and had not been very careful to preserve them,
not imagining that I should ever have this kind of use for them,
I did not doubt but they were all rotten, and, indeed, most of
them were so. However, I found two pieces which appeared
pretty good, and with these I went to work, and with a great
deal of pains, and awkward tedious stitching (you may be sure)
for want of needles, I, at length, made a three-corner ugly thing,
like what we call in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go
with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top, such
as usually our ships' longboats sail with, and such as I best know
how to manage; because it was such a one as I had to the boat
in which I made my escape from Barbary, as related in the first
part of my story.
I was near two months performing this last work, viz., rigging
and fitting my mast and sails; for 1 finished them very com-
plete, making a small stay, and a sail, or foresail, to it, to assist,
if we should turn to windward; and, which was more than all,
I fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer with; and though I
was but a bungling shipwright, yet as I knew the usefulness,
and even necessity, of such a thing, I applied myself with so
much pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass; though,
considering the many dull contrivances I had for it that failed,
I think it cost me almost as much labour as making the boat.
After all this was done too, I had my man Friday to teach
as to what belonged to the navigation of my boat; for though
he knew very well how to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing
what belonged to a sail and a rudder; and was the most amazed
when he saw me work the boat to and again in the sea by the
rudder, and how the sail jibbed, and filled this way, or that way,
as the course we sailed changed; I say, when he saw this, he
stood like one astonished and amazed. However, with a little
use I made all these things familiar to him, and he became an
expert sailor, except that as to the compass I could make him
understand very little of that. On the other hand, as there was
very little cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in
those parts, there was the less occasion for a compass, seeing
the stars were always to be seen by night, and the shore by day,
except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody cared to stir
abroad, either by land or sea.
I was now entered on the seven and twentieth year of my
captivity in this place; though the three last years that I had
this creature with me ought rather to be left out of the account,
my habitation being quite of another kind than in all the rest
of the time. I kept the anniversity of my landing here with the
same thankfulness to God for His mercies as at first; and if I
had such cause of acknowledgment at first, I had much more so
now, having such additional testimonies of the care of Provid-
ence over me, and the great hopes I had of being effectually
and speedily delivered; for I had an invincible impression upon
my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand, and that I should
not be another year in this place. However, I went on with my
husbandry, digging, planting, fencing, as usual. I gathered and
cured my grapes, and did every necessary thing as before.
The rainy season was, in the meantime, upon me, when I
kept more within doors than at other times; so I had stowed
our new vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up into the
creek, where, as I said in the beginning, I landed my rafts from
the ship; and hauling her up to the shore at high-water mark,
I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just big enough to
hold her, and just deep enough to give her water enough to
float in; and then, when the tide was out, we made a strong
dam across the end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay
dry, as to the tide, from the sea; and to keep the rain off, we
laid a great many boughs of trees, so thick, that she was as well
thatched as a house; and thus we waited for the month of
November and December, in which I designed to make my
adventure.
When the settled season began to come in, as the thought
of my design returned with the fair weather, I was preparing
daily for the voyage; and the first thing I did was to lay by a
certain quantity of provisions, being the stores for our voyage;
and intended, in a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock,
and launch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon some-
thing of this kind, when I called to Friday, and bid him go to
the sea-shore and see if he could find a turtle, or tortoise, a
thing which we generally got once a week, for the sake of the
eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not been long gone when
he came running back, and flew over my outer wall, or fence,
like one that felt not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on;
and before I had time to speak to him, he cries out to me, " O
master! O master! O sorrow! O bad!" "What's the
matter, Friday?" says I. "O yonder, there," says he, "one,
two, three canoe! one, two, three!" By his way of speaking, I
concluded there were six; but, on inquiry, I found it was but
three. "Well, Friday," says I, "do not be frighted." So I
heartened him up as well as I could. However, I saw the poor
fellow was most terribly scared ; for nothing ran in his head but
that they were come to look for him, and would cut him in
pieces, and eat him; and the poor fellow trembled so, that I
scarce knew what to do with him. I comforted him as
well as I could, and told him I was in as much danger as he,
and that they would eat me as well as him. "But," says I,
"Friday, we must resolve to fight them. Can you fight,
Friday?" "Me shoot," says he; "but there come many great
number." "No matter for that," said I again; "our guns will
fright them that we do not kill." So I asked him whether, if I
resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by me,
and do just as I bid him. He said, "Me die when you bid die,
master." So I went and fetched a good dram of rum, and gave
him; for I had been so good a husband of my rum, that I had
a great deal left. When he had drank it, I made him take the
two fowling-pieces, which we always carried, and load them
with large swan-shot, as big as small pistol-bullets. Then I
took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs and five
small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a brace
of bullets each. I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my
side, and gave Friday his hatchet.
When I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective
glass, and went up to the side of the hill to see what I could
discover; and I found quickly, by my glass, that there were one
and twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes, and that
their whole business seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon
these three human bodies; a barbarous feast indeed, but nothing
more than, as I had observed, was usual with them.
I observed also that they were landed, not where they had
done when Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek,
where the shore was low, and where a thick wood came close
almost down to the sea. This, with the abhorrence of the
inhuman errand these wretches came about, filled me with such
indignation, that I came down again to Friday, and told him I
was resolved to go down to them, and kill them all, and asked
him if he would stand by me. He was now gotten over his
fright, and his spirits being a little raised with the dram I had
given him, he was very cheerful, and told me, as before, he would
die when I bid die.
In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the arms which I
had charged, as before, between us. I gave Friday one pistol
to stick in his girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder; and I
took one pistol, and the other three myself, and in this posture
we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my pocket,
and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bullet; and
as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, and not to
stir, or shoot, or do anything, till I bid him, and in the mean-
time not to speak a word. In this posture I fetched a compass
to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over the creek
as to get into the wood, so that I might come within shot of
them before I should be discovered, which I had seen, by my
glass, it was easy to do.
While I was making this march, my former thoughts re-
turning, I began to abate my resolution. I do not mean that I
entertained any fear of their number; for as they were naked,
unarmed wretches, 'tis certain I was superior to them; nay,
though I had been alone. But it occurred to my thoughts
what call, what occasion, much less what necessity, I was in to
go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither
done or intended me any wrong; that whenever God thought
fit, He would take the cause into His own hands, and by
national vengeance, punish them, as a people, for national
crimes; but that, in the meantime, it was none of my business;
that, it was true, Friday might justify it, because he was a de-
clared enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular
people, and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I could
not say the same with respect to me. These things were so
warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that
I resolved I would only go and place myself near them, that I
might observe their barbarous feast, and that I would act then
as God should direct; but that, unless something offered that
was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I would not meddle
with them.
With this resolution I entered the wood, and with all
possible wariness and silence, Friday following close at my
heels, I marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the
side which was next to them; only that one corner of the wood
lay between me and them. Here I called softly to Friday, and
showing him a great tree, which was just at the corner of the
wood, I bade him go to the tree and bring me word if he could
see there plainly what they were doing. He did so, and came
immediately back to me, and told me they might be plainly
viewed there; that they were all about their fire, eating the
flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay bound upon
the sand, a little from them, which, he said, they would kill
next; and, which fired all the very soul within me, he told me
it was not one of their nation, but one of the bearded men,
whom he had told me of, that came to their country in the
boat. I was filled with horror at the very naming the white,
bearded man ; and going to the tree, I saw plainly, by my glass,
a white man, who lay upon the beach of the sea, with his hands
and his feet tied with flags, or things like rushes, and that he
was an European, and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about
fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by
going a little way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered,
and that then I should be within half shot of them; so I with-
held my passion, though I was indeed enraged to the highest
degree; and going back about twenty paces, I got behind some
bushes, which held all the way till I came to the other tree;
and then I came to a little rising ground, which gave me a full
view of them, at the distance of about eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful
wretches sat upon the ground, all close huddled together, and
had just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, and
bring him, perhaps limb by limb, to their fire; and they were
stooped down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to
Friday: "Now, Friday," said I, "do as I bid thee." Friday
said he would. "Then, Friday," says I, "do exactly as you see
me do; fail in nothing." So I set down one of the muskets
and the fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the like
by his; and with the other musket I took my aim at the
savages, bidding him do the like. Then asking him if he was
ready, he said, "Yes." "Then fire at them," said I; and the
same moment I fired also.
Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side
that he shot he killed two of them, and wounded three more;
and on my side I killed one, and wounded two. They were,
you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation; and all of them
who were not hurt jumped up upon their feet, but did not im-
mediately know which way to run, or which way to look, for
they knew not from whence their destruction came. Friday kept
his eyes close upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might observe
what I did; so as soon as the first shot was made I threw down
the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and Friday did the
like. He sees me cock and present; he did the same again.
"Are you ready, Friday?" said I. "Yes," says he. "Let fly,
then," says I, "in the name of God!" and with that I fired
again among the amazed wretches, and so did Friday; and as
our pieces were now loaded with what I called swan-shot, or small
pistol-bullets, we found only two drop, but so many were
wounded, that they ran about yelling and screaming like mad
creatures, all bloody, and miserably wounded most of them;
whereof three more fell quickly after, though not quite dead.
"Now, Friday," says I, laying down the discharged pieces,
and taking up the musket which was yet loaded, "follow me,"
says I, which he did with a great deal of courage; upon which
I rushed out of the wood, and showed myself, and Friday close
at my foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted as
loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too; and running as fast
as I could, which, by the way, was not very fast, being loaden
with arms as I was, I made directly towards the poor victim,
who was, as I said, lying upon the beach, or shore, between the

place where they sat and the sea. The two butchers, who were
just going .to work with him, had left him at the surprise of our
first fire, and fled in a terrible fright to the seaside, and had
jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest made the same
way. I turned to Friday, and bid him step forwards and fire at
them. He understood me immediately, and running about forty
yards, to be near them, he shot at them, and I thought he had
killed them all, for I saw them all fall of a heap into the boat;
though I saw two of them up again quickly. However, he killed
two of them, and wounded the third, so that he lay down in the
bottom of the boat as if he had been dead.
While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife
and cut the flags that bound the poor victim; and loosing his
hands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese
tongue what he was. He answered in Latin, Christianus; but
was so weak and faint, that he could scarce stand or speak. I
took my bottle out of my pocket and gave it him, making signs
that he should drink, which he did; and I gave him a piece of
bread, which he ate. Then I asked him what countryman he
was; and he said, Espagniole; and being a little recovered, let
me know, by all the signs he could possibly make, how much
he was in my debt for his deliverance. "Seignior," said I, with
as much Spanish as I could make up, "we will talk afterwards,
but we must fight now. If you have any strength left, take this
pistol and sword, and lay about you." He took them very
thankfully, and no sooner had he the arms in his hands but, as
if they had put new vigour into him, he flew upon his murderers
like a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant; for
the truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor
creatures were so much frighted with the noise of our pieces,
that they fell down for mere amazement and fear, and had no
more power to attempt their own escape, than their flesh had to
resist our shot; and that was the case of those five that Friday
shot at in the boat; for as three of them fell with the hurt they
received, so the other two fell with the fright.
I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being willing
to keep my charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my
pistol and sword. So I called to Friday, and bade him run up
to the tree from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which
M

WRINGING MY SWORD OUT of HIS HAND.
lay there that had been discharged, which he did with great
swiftness; and then giving him my musket, I sat down myself
to load all the rest again, and bade them come to me when they
wanted. While I was loading these pieces, there happened a
fierce engagement between the Spaniard and one of the savages,
who made at him with one of their great wooden swords, the
same weapon that was to have killed him before if I had not
prevented it. The Spaniard, who was as bold and as brave as
could be imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian a good
while, and had cut him two great wounds on his head; but the
savage being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with him, had
thrown him down, being faint, and was wringing my sword out
of his hand, when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quit-
ting the sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage
through the body, and killed him upon the spot, before I, who
was running to help him, could come near him.
Friday being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying
wretches with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and with
that he despatched those three who, as I said before, were
wounded at first, and fallen, and all the rest he could come up
with; and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him one
of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of the savages,
and wounded them both; but as he was not able to run, they
both got from him into the wood, where Friday pursued them,
and killed one of them; but the other was too nimble for him, and
though he was wounded, yet had plunged himself into the sea
and swam with all his might off to those two who were left in the
canoe; which three in the canoe, with one wounded, who we know
not whether he died or no, were all that escaped our hands of one
and twenty. The account of the rest is as follows:—
3 killed at our first shot from the tree.
2 killed at the next shot.
2 killed by Friday in the boat.
2 killed by ditto, of those at first wounded.
I killed by ditto in the wood.
3 killed by the Spaniard.
4 killed, being found dropped here and there of their wounds,
or killed by Friday in his chase of them.
4 escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead.
21 in all.
Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun-
shot; and though Friday made two or three shots at them, J did
not find that he hit any of them. Friday would fain have had me
take one of their canoes, and pursued them; and, indeed, I was
very anxious about their escape, lest carrying the news home to
their people they should come back perhaps with two or three
hundred of their canoes, and devour us by mere multitude. So
I consented to pursue them by sea, and running to one of their
canoes I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me. But when I
was in the canoe, I was surprised to find another poor creature
lie there alive, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the
slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what the
matter was; for he had not been able to look up over the side of
the boat, he was tied so hard, neck and heels, and had been tied
so long, that he had really but little life in him.
I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they had
bound him with, and would have helped him up; but he could
not stand or speak, but groaned most piteously, believing, it
seems, still that he was only unbound in order to be killed.
When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him, and
tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out my bottle, made him
give the poor wretch a dram; which, with the news of his being
delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat. But when
Friday came to hear him speak, and look in his face, it would
have moved any one to tears to have seen how Friday kissed
him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped
about, danced, sung; then cried again, wrung his hands, beat
his own face and head, and then sung and jumped about again,
like a distracted creature. It was a good while before I could
make him speak to me, or tell me what was the matter; but
when he came a little to himself, he told me that it was his
father.
It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see
what ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this poor savage
at the sight of his father, and of his being delivered from death;
nor, indeed, can I describe half the extravagancies of his affec-
tion after this; for he went into the boat, and out of the boat, a
great many times. When he went in to him, he would sit down
by him, open his breast, and hold his father's head close to his
bosom, half-an-hour together, to nourish it; then he took his
arms and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with the binding,
and chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and I, perceiving
what the case was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub
them with, which did them a great deal of good.
This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the
other savages, who were now gotten almost out of sight; and it
was happy for us that we did not, for it blew so hard within two
hours after, and before they could be gotten a quarter of their
way, and continued blowing so hard all night, and that from the
north-west, which was against them, that I could not suppose
their boat could live, or that they ever reached to their own
coast.
But to return to Friday. He was so busy about his father,
that I could not find in my heart to take him off for some time;
but after I thought he could leave him a little, I called him to
me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased to the
highest extreme. Then I asked him if he had given his father
any bread. He shook his head, and said, " None; ugly dog eat
all up self." So I gave him a cake of bread out of a little pouch
I carried on purpose. I also gave him a dram for himself, but
he would not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in my
pocket also two or three bunches of my raisins, so I gave him a
handful of them for his father. He had no sooner given his
father these raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat and run
away, as if he had been bewitched, he ran at such a rate; for he
was the swiftest fellow of his foot that ever I saw. I say, he
run at such a rate, that he was out of sight, as it were, in an
instant; and though I called, and hallooed too, after him, it was
all one, away he went; and in a quarter of an hour I saw him
come back again, though not so fast as he went; and as he came
nearer I found his pace was slacker, because he had something
in his hand.
When he came up to me, I found he had been quite home
for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his father some fresh water,
and that he had got two more cakes or loaves of bread. The
bread he gave me, but the water he carried to his father. How-
ever, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup of it. This
water revived his father more than all the rum or spirits I had
given him, for he was just fainting with thirst.
When his father had drank, I called to him to know if there
was any water left. He said "Yes ; " and I bade him give it to
the poor Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his father;
and I sent one of the cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard
too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing himself upon
a green place under the shade of a tree; and whose limbs were
also very stiff, and very much swelled with the rude bandage he
had been tied with. When I saw that upon Friday's coming to
him with the water he sat up and drank, and took the bread,
and began to eat, I went to him, and gave him a handful of
raisins. He looked up in my face with all the tokens of
gratitude and thankfulness that could appear in any countenance;
but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted himself in
the fight, that he could not stand up upon his feet. He tried to
do it two or three times, but was really not able, his ankles were

THE WATER REVIVED HIS FATHER.
so swelled and so painful to him; so I bade him sit still, and
caused Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum, as
he had done his father's.
I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes,
or perhaps less, all the while he was here, turned his head about
to see if his father was in the same place and posture as he left
him sitting; and at last he found he was not to be seen; at
which he started up, and without speaking a word, flew with
that swiftness to him, that one could scarce perceive his feet to
touch the ground as he went. But when he came, he only
found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs; so Friday
came back to me presently, and I then spoke to the Spaniard
to let Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him to the boat,
and then he should carry him to our dwelling, where I would
take care of him. But Friday, a lusty strong fellow, took the
Spaniard quite up upon his back, and carried him away to the
boat, and set him down softly upon the side or gunnel of the
canoe, with his feet in the inside of it, and then lifted him quite
in, and set him close to his father; and presently stepping out
again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore
faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard too.
So he brought them both safe into our creek, and leaving them
in the boat, runs away to fetch the other canoe. As he passed
me, I spoke to him, and asked him whither he went. He told
me, " Go fetch more boat." So away he went like the wind, for
sure never man or horse ran like him; and he had the other
canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by land; so he
wafted me over, and then went to help our new guests out of
the boat, which he did; but they were neither of them able to
walk, so that poor Friday knew not what to do.
To remedy this I went to work in my thought, and calling
to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to
me, I soon made a kind of hand-barrow to lay them on, and
Friday and I carried them up both together upon it between us.
But when we got them to the outside of our wall, or fortification,
we were at a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to get
them over, and I was resolved not to break it down. So I set
to work again; and Friday and I, in about two hours' time,
made a very handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above
that with boughs of trees, being in the space without our out-
ward fence, and between that and the grove of young wood
which I had planted; and here we made them two beds of such
things as I had, viz., of good rice-straw, with blankets laid upon
it to lie on, and another to cover them, on each bed.
My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich
in subjects; and it was a merry reflection, which I frequently
made, how like a king I looked. First of all, the whole country
was my own mere property, so that I had an undoubted right
of dominion. Secondly, my people were perfectly subjected
I was absolute lord and lawgiver; they all owed their lives to
me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there had been
occasion of it, for me. It was remarkable, too, we had but three
subjects, and they were of three different religions. My man
Friday was a Protestant, his father was a Pagan and a cannibal,
and the Spaniard was a Papist. However, I allowed liberty of
conscience throughout my dominions. But this is by the way.
As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners,
and given them shelter and a place to rest them upon, I began
to think of making some provision for them; and the first thing
I did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid
and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be killed; when I cut
off the hinder-quarter, and chopping it into small pieces, I set
Friday to work to boiling and stewing, and made them a very
good dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth, having put some
barley and rice also into the broth; and as I cooked it without
doors, for I made no fire within my inner wall, so I carried it all
into the new tent, and having set a table there for them, I sat
down and ate my own dinner also with them, and as well as I
could cheered them, and encouraged them; Friday being my
interpreter, especially to his father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard
too; for the Spaniard spoke the language of the savages pretty
well.
After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take
one of the canoes and go and fetch our muskets and other fire-
arms, which, for want of time, we had left upon the place of
battle; and the next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead
bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun, and would
presently be offensive; and I also ordered him to bury the
horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I knew were
pretty much, and which I could not think of doing myself; nay,
I could not bear to see them, if I went that way. All which he
punctually performed, and defaced the very appearance of the
savages being there; so that when I went again I could scarce
know where it was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood
pointing to the place.
I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two
new subjects; and first, I set Friday to inquire of his father
what he thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and
whether we might expect a return of them, with a power too
great for us to resist. His first opinion was, that the savages in
the boat never could live out the storm which blew that night
they went off, but must, of necessity, be drowned, or driven
south to those other shores, where they were as sure to be
devoured as they were to be drowned if they were cast away.
But as to what they would do if they came safe on shore, he said
he knew not; but it was his opinion that they were so dread-
fully frighted with the manner of their being attacked, the noise,
and the fire, that he believed they would tell their people they
were all killed by thunder and lightning, not by the hand of
man; and that the two which appeared, viz., Friday and me,
were two heavenly spirits, or furies, come down to destroy them,
and not men with weapons. This, he said, he knew, because he
heard them all cry out so in their language to one another; for
it was impossible to them to conceive that a man could dart
fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance without lifting up
the hand, as was done now. And this old savage was in the
right; for, as I understood since by other hands, the savages
never attempted to go over to the island afterwards. They
were so terrified with the accounts given by those four men (for,
it seems, they did escape the sea), that they believed whoever
went to that enchanted island would be destroyed with fire from
the gods.
This, however, I knew not, and therefore was under continual
apprehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my guard,
me and all my army; for as we were now four of us, I would
have ventured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the open field,
at any time.
In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear
of their coming wore off, and I began to take my former
thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration; being
likewise assured, by Friday's father, that I might depend upon
good usage from their nation, on his account, if I would go.
But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a
serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood
that there were sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese
who, having been cast away, and made their escape to that side,
lived there at peace, indeed, with the savages, but were very
sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed for life. I asked him
all the particulars of their voyage, and found they were a
Spanish ship bound from the Rio de la Plata to the Havana,
being directed to leave their loading there, which was chiefly hides
and silver, and to bring back what European goods they could
meet with there; that they had five Portuguese seamen on
board, whom they took out of another wreck; that five of their
own men were drowned when the first ship was lost, and that
these escaped, through infinite dangers and hazards, and arrived,
almost starved, on the cannibal coast, where they expected to
have been devoured every moment.
He told me they had some arms with them, but they were
perfectly useless, for that they had neither powder or ball, the
washing of the sea having spoiled all their powder but a little,
which they used, at their first landing, to provide themselves
some food.
I asked him what he thought would become of them there,
and if they had formed no design of making any escape? He
said they had many consultations about it; but that having
neither vessel, or tools to build one, or provisions of any kind,
their councils always ended in tears and despair.
I asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal
from me, which might tend towards an escape; and whether,
if they were all here, it might not be done? I told him with
freedom, I feared mostly their treachery and ill usage of me if
I put my life in their hands; for that gratitude was no inherent
virtue in the nature of man, nor did men always square their
dealings by the obligations they had received, so much as they
did by the advantages they expected. I told him it would be
very hard that I should be the instrument of their deliverance,
and that they should afterwards make me their prisoner in
New Spain, where an Englishman was certain to be made a
sacrifice, what necessity or what accident soever brought him
thither; and that I had rather be delivered up to the savages,
and be devoured alive, than fall into the merciless claws of the
priests, and be carried into the Inquisition. I added, that other-
wise I was persuaded, if they were all here, we might, with so
many hands, build a bark large enough to carry us all away,
either to the Brazils, southward, or to the islands, or Spanish
coast, northward; but that if, in requital, they should, when I
had put weapons into their hands, carry me by force among
their own people, I might be ill used for my kindness to them,
and make my case worse than it was before.
He answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuity,
that their condition was so miserable, and they were so sensible
of it, that he believed they would abhor the thought of using
any man unkindly that should contribute to their deliverance;
and that, if I pleased, he would go to them with the old man,
and discourse with them about it, and return again, and bring
me their answer; that he would make conditions with them
upon their solemn oath that they should be absolutely under
my leading, as their commander and captain; and that they
should swear upon the holy sacraments and the gospel to be
true to me, and to go to such Christian country as that I should
agree to, and no other, and to be directed wholly and absolutely
by my orders till they were landed safely in such country as I
intended; and that he would bring a contract from them, under
their hands, for that purpose.
Then he told me he would first swear to me himself, that he
would never stir from me as long as he lived till I gave him
orders; and that he would take my side to the last drop of his
blood, if there should happen the least breach of faith among
his countrymen.
He told me they were all of them very civil, honest men,
and they were under the greatest distress imaginable, having
neither weapons or clothes, or any food, but at the mercy and
discretion of the savages; out of all hopes of ever returning to
their own country; and that he was sure, if I would undertake
their relief, they would live and die by me.
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them,
if possible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over
to them to treat. But when we had gotten all things in a
readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started an objection,
which had so much prudence in it on one hand, and so much
sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be very well
satisfied in it, and by his advice put off the deliverance of his
comrades for at least half a year. The case was thus.
He had been with us now about a month, during which
time I had let him see in what manner I had provided, with the
assistance of Providence, for my support; and he saw evidently
what stock of corn and rice I had made up; which, as it was
more than sufficient for myself, so it was not sufficient, at least
without good husbandry, for my family, now it was increased to
number four; but much less would it be sufficient if his country-
men, who were, as he said, fourteen, still alive, should come over;
and least of all would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if we
should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies
of America. So he told me he thought it would be more
advisable to let him and the two others dig and cultivate some
more land, as much as I could spare seed to sow; and that we
should wait another harvest, that we might have a supply of
corn for his countrymen when they should come; for want
might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to think
themselves delivered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into
another. "You know," says he, "the children of Israel, though
they rejoiced at first for their being delivered out of Egypt, yet
rebelled even against God Himself, that delivered them, when
they came to want bread in the wilderness."
His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that
I could not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well
as I was satisfied with his fidelity. So we fell to digging all
four of us, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished with
permitted; and in about a month's time, by the end of which it
was seed-time, we had gotten as much land cured and trimmed
up as we sowed twenty-two bushels of barley on, and sixteen
jars of rice; which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare;
nor, indeed, did we leave ourselves barley sufficient for our own
food for the six months that we had to expect our crop; that is
to say, reckoning from the time we set our seed aside for sow-
ing; for it is not to be supposed it is six months in the ground
in that country.
Having now society enough, and our number being sufficient
to put us out of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless
their number had been very great, we went freely all over the
island, wherever we found occasion; and as here we had our
escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at
least for me, to have the means of it out of mine. To this
purpose I marked out several trees which I thought fit for our
work, and I set Friday and his father to cutting them down;
and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my
thought on that affair, to oversee and direct their work. I
showed them with what indefatigable pains I had hewed a large
tree into single planks, and I caused them to do the like, till they
had made about a dozen large planks of good oak, near two
feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to four inches
thick. What prodigious labour it took up, any one may imagine.
At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock of
tame goats as much as I could; and to this purpose I made
Friday and the Spaniard go out one day, and myself with
Friday the next day, for we took our turns, and by this means
we got above twenty young kids to breed up with the rest; for
whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and added them
to our flock. But above all, the season for curing the grapes
coming on, I caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up
in the sun, that I believe, had we been at Alicant, where the
raisins of the sun are cured, we could have filled sixty or eighty
barrels; and these, with our bread, was a great part of our food,
and very good living too, I assure you; for it is an exceeding
nourishing food.
It was now harvest, and our crop in good order. It was not
the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, how-
ever, it was enough to answer our end; for from our twenty-
two bushels of barley we brought in and thrashed out above
two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in proportion of
the rice; which was store enough for our food to the next
harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore
with me; or if we had been ready for a voyage, it would very
plentifully have victualled our ship to have carried us to any
part of the world, that is to say, of America.
When we had thus housed and secured our magazine of corn,
we fell to work to make more wicker-work, viz., great baskets,
in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and
dexterous at this part, and often blamed me that I did not
make some things for defence of this kind of work; but I saw
no need of it.
And now having a full supply of food for all the guests
I expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main,
to see what he could do with those he had left behind him
there. I gave him a strict charge in writing not to bring any
man with him who would not first swear, in the presence of
himself and of the old savage, that he would no way injure,
fight with, or attack the person he should find in the island,
who was so kind to send for them in order to their deliverance;
but that they would stand by and defend him against all such
attempts, and wherever they went would be entirely under and
subjected to his commands; and that this should be put in
writing, and signed with their hands. How we were to have
this done, when I knew they had neither pen or ink, that indeed
was a question which we never asked.
Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old savage,
the father of Friday, went away in one of the canoes which
they might be said to come in, or rather were brought in, when
they came as prisoners to be devoured by the savages.
I gave each of them a musket, with a firelock on it, and
about eight charges of powder and ball, charging them to be
very good husbands of both, and not to use either of them but
upon urgent occasion.
This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by
me, in view of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years and
some days. I gave them provisions of bread and of dried
grapes sufficient for themselves for many days, and sufficient
for all their countrymen for about eight days' time; and wish-
ing them a good voyage, I see them go, agreeing with them
about a signal they should hang out at their return, by which I
should know them again, when they came back, at a distance,
before they came on shore.
They went away with a fair gale on the day that the moon
was at full, by my account in the month of October; but as for
an exact reckoning of days, after I had once lost it, I could
never recover it again; nor had I kept even the number of
years so punctually as to be sure that I was right, though as it
proved, when I afterwards examined my account, I found I had
kept a true reckoning of years.
It was nu less than eight days I had waited for them, when
a strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like
has not perhaps been heard of in history. I was fast asleep in
my hutch one morning, when my man Friday came running in
to me, and called aloud, "Master, master, they are come, they
are come!"
I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went out as soon
as I could get my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by
the way, was by this time grown to be a very thick wood; I
say, regardless of danger, I went without my arms, which was
not my custom to do; but I was surprised when, turning my

PLAINLY DISCOVERED A SHIP.
eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at about a league and
half's distance standing in for the shore, with a shoulder-of-
mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair to
bring them in; also I observed presently that they did not
come from that side which the shore lay on, but from the
southernmost end of the island. Upon this I called Friday in,
and bid him lie close, for these were not the people we looked
for, and that we might not know yet whether they were friends
or enemies.
In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective glass,
to see what I could make of them; and having taken the ladder
out, I climbed up to the top of the hill, as I used to do when I
was apprehensive of anything, and to take my view the plainer,
without being discovered.
I had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my eye plainly
discovered a ship lying at an anchor at about two leagues and
an half s distance from me, south-south-east, but not above a
league and an half from the shore. By my observation, it
appeared plainly to be an English ship, and the boat appeared
to be an English longboat.
I cannot express the confusion I was in; though the joy of
seeing a ship, and one who I had reason to believe was manned
by my own countrymen, and consequently friends, was such as
I cannot describe. But yet I had some secret doubts hung
about me, I cannot tell from whence they came, bidding
me keep upon my guard. In the first place, it occurred to me
to consider what business an English ship could have in that
part of the world, since it was not the way to or from any part
of the world where the English had any traffic; and I knew
there had been no storms to drive them in there as in distress;
and that if they Were English really, it was most probable that
they were here upon no good design; and that I had better
continue as I was, than fall into the hands of thieves and
murderers.
I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I saw the
boat draw near the shore, as if they looked for a creek to thrust
in at, for the convenience of landing. However, as they did
not come quite far enough, they did not see the little inlet
where I formerly landed my rafts; but run their boat on shore
upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, which was very
happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed just, as I
may say, at my door, and would soon have beaten me out of my
castle, and perhaps have plundered me of all I had.
When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied that they were
Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two I thought were
Dutch, but it did not prove so. There were in all eleven men,
whereof three of them I found were unarmed and, as I thought,
bound; and when the first four or five of them were jumped on
shore, they took those three out of the boat, as prisoners. One
of the three I could perceive using the most passionate gestures of
entreaty, affliction, and despair, even to a kind of extravagance;
the other two, I could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes,
and appeared concerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the
first.
I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what
the meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me in
English as well as he could, "O master! you see English mans
eat prisoner as well as savage mans." "Why," says I, " Friday,
do you think they are a-going to eat them then?" "Yes," says
Friday, " they will eat them." "No, no," says I, " Friday, I am
afraid they will murder them indeed, but you may be sure they
will not eat them."
All this while I had no thought of what the matter really
was, but stood trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting
every moment when the three prisoners should be killed; nay,
once I saw one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass,
as the seamen call it, or sword, to strike one of the poor men;
and I expected to see him fall every moment, at which all the
blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins.
I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the savage that
was gone with him; or that I had any way to have come undis-
covered within shot of them, that I might have rescued the three
men, for I saw no firearms they had among them; but it fell out
to my mind another way.
After I had observed the outrageous usage of the three men
by the insolent seamen, I observed the fellows run scattering
about the land, as if they wanted to see the country. I observed
that the three other men had liberty to go also where they
pleased; but they sat down all three upon the ground, very
pensive, and looked like men in despair.
This put me in mind of the first time when I came on shore,
and began to look about me; how I gave myself over for lost;
how wildly I looked round me; what dreadful apprehensions I
had; and how I lodged in the tree all night, for fear of being
devoured by wild beasts.
As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was to receive
by the providential driving of the ship nearer the land by the
storms and tide, by which I have since been so long nourished
and supported; so these three poor desolate men knew nothing
how certain of deliverance and supply they were, how near it
was to them, and how effectually and really they w ere in a con-
dition of safety, at the same time that they thought themselves
lost, and their case desperate.
It was just at the top of high-water when these people came
on shore; and while partly they stood parleying with the
N
prisoners they brought, and partly while they rambled about to
see what kind of a place they were in, they had carelessly stayed
till the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably
away, leaving their boat aground.
They had left two men in the boat, who, as I found after-
wards, having drank a little too much brandy, fell asleep. How-
ever, one of them waking sooner than the other, and finding the
boat too fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed for the rest,
who were straggling about, upon which they all soon came to
the boat; but it was past all their strength to launch her, the
boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft
oozy sand, almost like a quicksand.
In this condition, like true seamen, who are perhaps the least
of all mankind given to forethought, they gave it over, and away
they strolled about the country again; and I heard one of them
say aloud to another, calling them off from the boat, " Why, let
her alone, Jack, can't ye? she will float next tide ;" by which I
was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen
they were.
All this while I kept myself very close, not once daring to
stir out of my castle, any farther than to my place of observa-
tion near the top of the hill; and very glad I was to think how
well it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours be-
fore the boat could be on float again, and by that time it would
be dark, and I might be at more liberty to see their motions, and
to hear their discourse, if they had any.
In the meantime, I fitted myself up for a battle, as before,
though with more caution, knowing I had to do with another
kind of enemy than I had at first. I ordered Friday also, whom
I had made an excellent marksman with his gun, to load him-
self with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave
him three muskets. My figure, indeed, was very fierce. I had
my formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I have
mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my belt,
and a gun upon each shoulder.
It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any
attempt till it was dark; but about two o'clock, being the heat
of the day, I found that, in short, they were all gone straggling
into the woods, and, as I thought, were laid down to sleep. The

"HE MUST BE SENT DIRECTLY FROM HEAVEN."
three poor distressed men, too anxious for their condition to get
any sleep, were, however, set down under the shelter of a great
tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as I thought,
out of sight of any of the rest.
Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn
something of their condition. Immediately I marched in the
figure as above, my man Friday at a good distance behind me,
as formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring
a spectre-like figure as I did.
I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and then, before
any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, "What
are ye, gentlemen?"
They started up at the noise, but were ten times more con-
founded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure that I made.
They made no answer at all, but I thought I perceived them
just going to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English.
"Gentlemen," said I, "do not be surprised at me; perhaps you
may have a friend near you, when you did not expect it." "He
must be sent directly from heaven then," said one of them very
gravely to me, and pulling off his hat at the same time to me,
"for our condition is past the help of man." "All help is from
heaven, sir," said I. "But can you put a stranger in the way
how to help you, for you seem to me to be in some great dis-
tress? I saw you when you landed; and when you seemed to
make applications to the brutes that came with you, I saw one
of them lift up his sword to kill you."
The poor man, with tears running down his face, and tremb-
ling, looking like one astonished, returned, "Am I talking to
God, or man? Is it a real man, or an angel?" "Be in no fear
about that, sir," said I. "If God had sent an angel to relieve you,
he would have come better clothed, and armed after another
manner than you see me in. Pray lay aside your fears; I am a
man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you, you see. I
have one servant only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us
freely, can we serve you? What is your case?"
"Our case," said he, "sir, is too long to tell you while our
murderers are so near; but in short, sir, I was commander of
that ship; my men have mutinied against me, they have been
hardly prevailed on not to murder me; and at last have set
me on shore in this desolate place, with these two men with
me, one my mate, the other a passenger, where we expected to
perish, believing the place to be uninhabited, and know not yet
what to think of it."
"Where are those brutes, your enemies ?" said I. "Do you
know where they are gone?" "There they lie, sir," said he,
pointing to a thicket of trees. "My heart trembles for fear they
have seen us, and heard you speak. If they have, they will
certainly murder us all."
"Have they any firearms?" said I. He answered, they had
only two pieces, and one which they left in the boat. "Well
then," said I, "leave the rest to me, I see they are all asleep; it
is an easy thing to kill them all; but shall we rather take them
prisoners?" He told me there were two desperate villains
among them that it was scarce safe to show any mercy to; but
if they were secured, he believed all the rest would return to
their duty. I asked him which they were. He told me he
could not at that distance describe them, but he would obey
my orders in anything I would direct. "Well," says I, " let us
retreat out of their view or hearing, lest they awake, and we
will resolve further." So they willingly went back with me, till
the woods covered us from them.
"Look you, sir," said I, " if I venture upon your deliverance,
are you willing to make two conditions with me?" He
anticipated my proposals, by telling me that both he and the
ship, if recovered, should be wholly directed and commanded
by me in everything; and if the ship was not recovered, he
would live and die with me in what part of the world soever I
would send him; and the two other men said the same.
"Well," says I, " my conditions are but two. I. That while
you stay on this island with me, you will not pretend to any
authority here; and if I put arms into your hands, you will,
upon all occasions, give them up to me, and do no prejudice to
me or mine upon this island ; and in the meantime, be governed
by my orders. 2. That if the ship is, or may be, recovered, you
will carry me and my man to England, passage free."
He gave me all the assurances that the invention and faith
of man could devise that he would comply with these most
reasonable demands; and, besides, would owe his life to me, and
acknowledge it upon all occasions, as long as he lived.
"Well then," said I, "here are three muskets for you, with
powder and ball; tell me next what you think is proper to be
done." He showed all the testimony of his gratitude that he
was able, but offered to be wholly guided by me. I told him I
thought it was hard venturing anything; but the best method
I could think of was to fire upon them at once as they lay; and
if any was not killed at the first volley, and offered to submit,
we might save them, and so put it wholly upon God's providence
to direct the shot.
He said very modestly that he was loth to kill them, if he
could help it; but that those two were incorrigible villains, and
had been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if they
escaped, we should be undone still; for they would go on board
and bring the whole ship's company, and destroy us all. "Well
then," says I, "necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the
only way to save our lives." However, seeing him still cautious
of shedding blood, I told him they should go themselves, and
manage as they found convenient.
In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake,
and soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him
if either of them were of the men who he had said were the
heads of the mutiny. He said, "No." "Well then," said I,
"you may let them escape; and Providence seems to have
wakened them on purpose to save themselves. Now," says I,
"if the rest escape you, it is your fault."
Animated with this, he took the musket I had given him in
his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with
him, with each man a piece in his hand. The two men who
were with him going first made some noise, at which one of the
seamen who was awake turned about, and seeing them coming
cried out to the rest; but it was too late then, for the moment
he cried out they fired; I mean the two men, the captain wisely
reserving his own piece. They had so well aimed their shot at
the men they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot,
and the other very much wounded; but not being dead, he
started up upon his feet, and called eagerly for help to the other.
But the captain stepping to him, told him 'twas too late to cry
for help, he should call upon God to forgive his villainy; and
with that word knocked him down with the stock of his musket,
so that he never spoke more. There were three more in the
company, and one of them was also slightly wounded. By this
time I was come; and when they saw their danger, and that it
was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. The captain told
them he would spare their lives if they would give him any
assurance of their abhorrence of the treachery they had been
guilty of, and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering
the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from
whence they came. They gave him all the protestations of
their sincerity that could be desired, and he was willing to
believe them, and spare their lives, which I was not against,
only I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot while
they were upon the island.
While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate
to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring away the oars
and sail, which they did; and by-and-by three straggling men,
that were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came back
upon hearing the guns fired; and seeing their captain, who

KNOCKED HIM DOWN WITH THE STOCK.
before was their prisoner, now their conqueror, they submitted
to be bound also, and so our victory was complete.
It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into
one another's circumstances. I began first, and told him my
whole history, which he heard with an attention even to amaze-
ment; and particularly at the wonderful manner of my being
furnished with provisions and ammunition; and, indeed, as my
story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply.
But when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I
seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his life,
the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word
more.
After this communication was at an end, I carried him and
his two men into my apartment, leading them in just where I
came out, viz., at the top of the house, where I refreshed them
with such provisions as I had, and showed them all the con-
trivances I had made during my long, long inhabiting that
place.
All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing;
but above all, the captain admired my fortification, and how
perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which,
having been now planted near twenty years, and the trees
growing much faster than in England, was become a little
wood, and so thick, that it was unpassable in any part of it but
at that one side where I had reserved my little winding passage
into it. I told him this was my castle and my residence, but
that I had a seat in the country, as most princes have, whither
I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show him that too
another time; but at present, our business was to consider how
to recover the ship. He agreed with me as to that, but told me
he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take, for that there
were still six and twenty hands on board, who having entered
into a cursed conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their
lives to the law, would be hardened in it now by desperation,
and would carry it on, knowing that if they were reduced, they
should be brought to the gallows as soon as they came to
England, or to any of the English colonies; and that therefore
there would be no attacking them with so small a number as
we were.
I mused for some time upon what he said, and found it was
a very rational conclusion, and that therefore something was to
be resolved on very speedily, as well to draw the men on board
into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent their landing
upon us, and destroying us. Upon this it presently occurred to
me that in a little while the ship's crew, wondering what was
become of their comrades, and of the boat, would certainly come
on shore in their other boat to see for them; and that then,
perhaps, they might come armed, and be too strong for us.
This he allowed was rational.
Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to do was to
stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so that they might
not carry her off; and taking everything out of her, leave her
so far useless as not to be fit to swim. Accordingly we went
on board, took the arms which were left on board out of her,
and whatever else we found there, which was a bottle of brandy,
and another of rum, a few biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a
great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas—the sugar was five or
six pounds; all which was very welcome to me, especially the
brandy and sugar, of which I had had none left for many years.
When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars,
mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were carried away before, as
above), we knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if they had
come strong enough to master us, yet they could not carry off
the boat.
Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts that we could be
able to recover the ship; but my view was, that if they went
away without the boat, I did not much question to make her
fit again to carry us away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon
our friends the Spaniards in my way; for I had them still in
my thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by
main strength, heaved the boat up upon the beach so high that
the tide would not fleet her off at high-water mark ; and besides,
had broke a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly stopped,
and were sat down musing what we should do, we heard the
ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft with her ancient as a
signal for the boat to come on board. But no boat stirred; and
they fired several times, making other signals for the boat.
At last, when all their signals and firings proved fruitless,
and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help
of my glasses, hoist another boat out, and row towards the
shore; and we found, as they approached, that there was no less
than ten men in her, and that they had firearms with them.
As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had
a full view of them as they came, and a plain sight of the men,
even of their faces; because the tide having set them a little to
the east of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to come
to the same place where the other had landed, and where the
boat lay.
By this means, I say, we had a full view of them, and the
captain knew the persons and characters of all the men in the
boat, of whom he said that there were three very honest fellows,
who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest,
being overpowered and frighted; but that as for the boatswain,
who, it seems, was the chief officer among them, and all the
rest, they were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew, and
were no doubt made desperate in their new enterprise; and
terribly apprehensive he was that they would be too powerful
for us.
I smiled at him, and told him that men in our circumstances
were past the operation of fear; that seeing almost every con-
dition that could be was better than that which we were sup-
posed to be in, we ought to expect that the consequence, whether
death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I asked him
what he thought of the circumstances of my life, and whether
a deliverance were not worth venturing for? "And where,sir,"
said I, "is your belief of my being preserved here on purpose to
save your life, which elevated you a little while ago? For my
part," said I, "there seems to be but one thing amiss in all the
prospect of it." "What's that?" says he. "Why," said I, "'tis
that, as you say, there are three or four honest fellows among
them, which should be spared; had they been all of the wicked
part of the crew I should have thought God's providence had
singled them out to deliver them into your hands; for depend
upon it, every man of them that comes ashore are our own, and
shall die or live as they behave to us."
As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance,
I found it greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our
business. We had, upon the first appearance of the boat's
coming from the ship, considered of separating our prisoners,
and had, indeed, secured them effectually.
Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured than
ordinary, I sent with Friday and one of the three delivered men
to my cave, where they were remote enough, and out of danger
of being heard or discovered, or of finding their way out of the
woods if they could have delivered themselves. Here they left
them bound, but gave them provisions, and promised them, if
they continued there quietly, to give them their liberty in a
day or two; but that if they attempted their escape, they should
be put to death without mercy. They promised faithfully to
bear their confinement with patience, and were very thankful
that they had such good usage as to have provisions and a light
left them; for Friday gave them candles (such as we made our-
selves) for their comfort; and they did not know but that he
stood sentinel over them at the entrance.
The other prisoners had better usage. Two of them were
kept pinioned, indeed, because the captain was not free to trust
them; but the other two were taken into my service, upon their
captain's recommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging
to live and die with us; so with them and the three honest men
we were seven men well armed; and I made no doubt we should
be able to deal well enough with the ten that were a-coming,
considering that the captain had said there were three or four
honest men among them also.
As soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay,
they ran their boat into the beach, and came all on shore, haul-
ing the boat up after them, which I was glad to see; for I was
afraid they would rather have left the boat at an anchor some
distance from the shore, with some hands in her to guard her,
and so we should not be able to seize the boat.
Being on shore, the first thing they did they ran all to their
other boat; and it was easy to see that they were under a great
surprise to find her stripped, as above, of all that was in her,
and a great hole in her bottom.
After they had mused a while upon this, they set up two or
three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try if they
could make their companions hear; but all was to no purpose.
Then they came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their
small arms, which, indeed, we heard, and the echoes made the
woods ring. But it was all one; those in the cave we were
sure could not hear, and those in our keeping, though they
heard it well enough, yet durst give no answer to them.
They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that, as they
told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on board again, to
their ship, and let them know there that the men were all
murdered, and the longboat staved. Accordingly, they im-
mediately launched their boat again, and gat all of them on
board.
The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded at
this, believing they would go on board the ship again, and set
sail, giving their comrades for lost, and so he should still lose
the ship, which he was in hopes we should have recovered; but
he was quickly as much frighted the other way.
They had not been long put off with the boat but we per-
ceived them all coming on shore again; but with this new
measure in their conduct, which it seems they consulted together
upon, viz., to leave three men in the boat, and the rest to go on
shore, and go up into the country to look for their fellows.
This was a great disappointment to us, for now we were at
a loss what to do; for our seizing those seven men on shore
would be no advantage to us if we let the boat escape, because
they would then row away to the ship, and then the rest of
them would be sure to weigh and set sail, and so our recovering
the ship would be lost. However, we had no remedy but to
wait and see what the issue of things might present. The
seven men came on shore, and the three who remained in the
boat put her off to a good distance from the shore, and came to
an anchor to wait for them; so that it was impossible for us to
come at them in the boat.
Those that came on shore kept close together, marching
towards the top of the little hill under which my habitation
lay; and we could see them plainly, though they could not
perceive us. We could have been very glad they would have
come nearer to us, so that we might have fired at them, or that
they would have gone farther off, that we might have come
abroad.
But when they were come to the brow of the hill, where they
could see a great way into the valleys and woods which lay
towards the north-east part, and where the island lay lowest,
they shouted and hallooed till they were weary; and not caring,
it seems, to venture far from the shore, nor far from one
another, they sat down together under a tree, to consider of it.
Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other
party of them had done, they had done the job for us; but they
were too full of apprehensions of danger to venture to go to
sleep, though they could not tell what the danger was they had
to fear neither.
The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this con-
sultation of theirs, viz., that perhaps they would all fire a volley
again, to endeavour to make their fellows hear, and that we
should all sally upon them, just at the juncture when their
pieces were all discharged, and they would certainly yield, and
we should have them without bloodshed. I liked the proposal,
provided it was done while we were near enough to come up to
them before they could load their pieces again.
But this event did not happen, and we lay still a long time,
very irresolute what course to take. At length I told them
there would be nothing to be done, in my opinion, till night;
and then, if they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might
find a way to get between them and the shore, and so might
use some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on
shore.
We waited a great while, though very impatient for their
removing; and were very uneasy when, after long consulta-
tions, we saw them start all up, and march down toward the sea.
It seems they had such dreadful apprehensions upon them
of the danger of the place, that they resolved to go on board the
ship again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on with
their intended voyage with the ship.
As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I im-
agined it to be, as it really was, that they had given over their
search, and were for going back again; and the captain, as soon
as I told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the appre-
hensions of it; but I presently thought of a stratagem to fetch
them back again, and which answered my end to a tittle.
I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over the little
creek westward, towards the place where the savages came on
shore when Friday was rescued, and as soon as they came to a
little rising ground, at about half a mile distance, I bade them
halloo as loud as they could, and wait till they found the sea-
men heard them; that as soon as ever they heard the seamen
answer them, they should return it again; and then keeping out
of sight, take a round, always answering when the other
hallooed, to draw them as far into the island, and among the
woods, as possible, and then wheel about again to me by such
ways as I directed them.
They were just going into the boat when Friday and the
mate hallooed; and they presently heard them, and answering,
run along the shore westward, towards the voice they heard,
when they were presently stopped by the creek, where the water
being up, they could not get over, and called for the boat to
come up and set them over, as, indeed, I expected.
When they had set themselves over, I observed that the
boat being gone up a good way into the creek, and, as it were,
in a harbour within the land, they took one of the three men
out of her to go along with them, and left only two in the
boat, having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the
shore.
That was what I wished for; and immediately leaving
Friday and the captain's mate to their business, I took the rest
with me, and crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised
the two men before they were aware; one of them lying on
shore, and the other being in the boat. The fellow on shore
was between sleeping and waking, and going to start up. The
captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked him
down, and then called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was
a dead man.
There needed very few arguments to persuade a single man
to yield when he saw five men upon him, and his comrade
knocked down; besides, this was, it seems, one of the three who
were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and
therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards
to join very sincerely with us.
In the meantime, Friday and the captain's mate so well
managed their business with the rest, that they drew them, by
hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from one
wood to another, till they not only heartily tired them, but left
them where they were very sure they could not reach back to the
boat before it was dark; and, indeed, they were heartily tired
themselves also by the time they came back to us.
We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the
dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with
them.
It was several hours after Friday came back to me before
they came back to their boat; and we could hear the foremost

CALLED OUT TO HIM IN THE BOAT TO YIELD.
of them, long before they came quite up, calling to those behind
to come along, and could also hear them answer and complain
how lame and tired they were, and not able to come any faster;
which was very welcome news to us.
At length they came up to the boat; but 'tis impossible to
express their confusion when they found the boat fast aground
in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone. We
could hear them call to one another in a most lamentable
manner, telling one another they were gotten into an enchanted
island; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they should
all be murdered, or else there were devils and spirits in it, and
they should all be carried away and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their
names a great many times; but no answer. After some time
we could see them, by the little light there was, run about,
wringing their hands like men in despair, and that sometimes
they would go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves,
then come ashore again, and walk about again, and so the same
thing over again.
My men would fain have me give them leave to fall upon
them at once in the dark; but I was willing to take them at
some advantage, so to spare them, and kill as few of them as I
could; and especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing any
of our own men, knowing the other were very well armed. I
resolved to wait, to see if they did not separate; and, therefore,
to make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade nearer, and
ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands and
feet, as close to the ground as they could, that they might not
be discovered, and get as near them as they could possibly,
before they offered to fire.
They had not been long in that posture but that the boat-
swain, who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had
now shown himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the
rest, came walking towards them, with two more of their crew.
The captain was so eager, as having this principal rogue so
much in his power, that he could hardly have patience to let
him come so near as to be sure of him, for they only heard his
tongue before; but when they came nearer, the captain and
Friday, starting up on their feet, let fly at them.
The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the next man was
shot into the body, and fell just by him, though he did not
die till an hour or two after; and the third ran for it.
At the noise of the fire I immediately advanced with my
whole army, which was now eight men, viz., myself, general-
issimo; Friday, my lieutenant-general; the captain and his two
men, and the three prisoners of war, whom we had trusted
with arms.
We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could
not see our number; and I made the man we had left in the
boat, who was now one of us, call to them by name, to try if I
could bring them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce them
to terms, which fell out just as we desired; for indeed it was
easy to think, as their condition then was, they would be very
willing to capitulate. So he calls out as loud as he could to one
of them, "Tom Smith! Tom Smith!" Tom Smith answered
immediately, " Who's that? Robinson?" For it seems he knew
his voice. The other answered, "Ay, ay; for God's sake, Tom
Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or you are all dead
men this moment."
"Who must we yield to? Where are they?" says Smith
again. "Here they are," says he; "here's our captain, and fifty
men with him, have been hunting you this two hours; the
boatswain is killed, Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner;
and if you do not yield, you are all lost."
"Will they give us quarter then," says Tom Smith, "and
we will yield?" "I'll go and ask, if you promise to yield,"
says Robinson. So he asked the captain, and the captain then
calls himself out, "You, Smith, you know my voice, if you lay
down your arms immediately, and submit, you shall have your
lives, all but Will Atkins."
Upon this Will Atkins cried out, "For God's sake, captain,
give me quarter; what have I done? They have been all as
bad as I"; which, by the way, was not true neither; for, it
seems, this Will Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the
captain when they first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in
tying his hands, and giving him injurious language. However,
the captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion,
and trust to the governor's mercy; by which he meant me, for
they all called me governor.
In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged their
lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed with them and two
more, who bound them all ; and then my great army of fifty
men, which, particularly with those three, were all but eight,
came up and seized upon them all, and upon their boat; only
that I kept myself and one more out of sight for reasons of
state.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing
the ship; and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley
with them, he expostulated with them upon the villainy of their
practices with him, and at length upon the farther wickedness
of their design, and how certainly it must bring them to misery
and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.
They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their
lives. As for that, he told them they were none of his prisoners,
but the commander of the island; that they thought they had set
o
him on shore in a barren, uninhabited island; but it had pleased
God so to direct them that the island was inhabited, and that
the governor was an Englishman; that he might hang them all
there, if he pleased; but as he had given them all quarter, he
supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with there
as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was commanded by
the governor to advise to prepare for death, for that he would
be hanged in the morning.
Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had its
desired effect. Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the captain
to intercede with the governor for his life; and all the rest
begged of him, for God's sake, that they might not be sent to
England.
It now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was
come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these
fellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the ship; so I
retired in the dark from them, that they might not see what
kind of a governor they had, and called the captain to me.
When I called, as at a good distance, one of the men was
ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, "Captain, the
commander calls for you." And presently the captain replied,
"Tell his excellency I am just a-coming." This more perfectly
amused them, and they all believed that the commander was
just by with his fifty men.
Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my project for
seizing the ship, which he liked of wonderfully well, and resolved
to put it in execution the next morning. But in order to
execute it with more art, and secure of success, I told him we
must divide the prisoners, and that he should go and take
Atkins and two more of the worst of them, and send them
pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This was committed
to Friday and the two men who came on shore with the
captain.
They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison. And it
was, indeed, a dismal place, especially to men in their condition.
The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of which I have
given a full description; and as it was fenced in, and they
pinioned, the place was secure enough, considering they were
upon their behaviour.
To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter
into a parley with them; in a word, to try them, and tell me
whether he thought they might be trusted or no to go on board
and surprise the ship. He talked to them of the injury done
him, of the condition they were brought to; and that though
the governor had given them quarter for their lives as to the
present action, yet that if they were sent to England they would
all be hanged in chains, to be sure; but that if they would join
in so just an attempt as to recover the ship, he would have the
governor's engagement for their pardon.
Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be
accepted by men in their condition. They fell down on their
knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest impreca-
tions, that they would be faithful to him to the last drop, and
that they should owe their lives to him, and would go with him
all over the world; that they would own him for a father to
them as long as they lived.
"Well," says the captain, " I must go and tell the governor
what you say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent to
it." So he brought me an account of the temper he found them
in, and that he verily believed they would be faithful.
However, that we might be very secure, I told him he should
go back again and choose out five of them, and tell them they
might see that he did not want men, that he would take out
those five to be his assistants, and that the governor would keep
the other two and the three that were sent prisoners to the
castle, my cave, as hostages for the fidelity of those five; and
that if they proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hostages
should be hanged in chains alive upon the shore.
This looked severe, and convinced them that the governor
was in earnest. However, they had no way left them but to
accept it; and it was now the business of the prisoners, as much
as of the captain, to persuade the other five to do their duty.
Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition. I.

captain, I had given their liberty, and trusted them with arms.

pinioned, but upon the captain's motion had now released.

MADE ROBINSON HAIL THEM.
4. These five released at last; so that they were twelve in all,
besides five we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.
I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these
hands on board the ship; for as for me and my man Friday, I
did not think it was proper for us to stir, having seven men left
behind, and it was employment enough for us to keep them
asunder and supply them with victuals. As to the five in the
cave, I resolved to keep them fast; but Friday went in twice a
day to them, to supply them with necessaries, and I made the
other two carry provisions to a certain distance, where Friday
was to take it.
When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the
captain, who told them I was the person the governor had
ordered to look after them, and that it was the governor's pleas-
ure they should not stir anywhere but by my direction; that if
they did, they should be fetched into the castle, and be laid in
irons; so that as we never suffered them to see me as governor,
so I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the governor,
the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.
The captain now had no difficulty before him but to furnish
his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He made
his passenger captain of one, with four other men; and himself,
and his mate, and five more went in the other; and they con-
trived their business very well, for they came up to the ship about
midnight. As soon as they came within call of the ship, he
made Robinson hail them, and tell them they brought off the
men and the boat, but that it was a long time before they had
found them, and the like, holding them in a chat till they came
to the ship's side; when the captain and the mate entering first,
with their arms, immediately knocked down the second mate
and carpenter with the butt-end of their muskets, being very
faithfully seconded by their men. They secured all the rest that
were upon the main and quarter decks, and began to fasten the
hatches to keep them down who were below; when the other
boat and their men entering at the fore-chains, secured the fore-
castle of the ship, and the scuttle which went down into the
cook-room, making three men they found there prisoners.
When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain
ordered the mate, with three men, to break into the round-
house, where the new rebel captain lay, and having taken the
alarm was gotten up, and with two men and a boy had gotten
firearms in their hands; and when the mate with a crow split
open the door, the new captain and his men fired boldly
among them, and wounded the mate with a musket-ball, which
broke his arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed
nobody.
The mate calling for help, rushed however into the round-
house wounded as he was, and with his pistol shot the new
captain through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth and
came out again behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke
a word; upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken
effectually, without any more lives lost.
As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered
seven guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with
me to give me notice of his success, which you may be sure I
was very glad to hear, having sat watching upon the shore for
it till near two of the clock in the morning.
Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and
it having been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound,
till I was something surprised with the noise of a gun; and

SHOT THE NEW CAPTAIN THROUGH THE HEAD.
presently starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of
"Governor," "Governor," and presently I knew the captain's
voice; when climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood,
and pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms. "My dear
friend and deliverer," says he, "there's your ship, for she is all
yours, and so are we, and all that belong to her," I cast my
eyes to the ship, and there she rode within little more than
half a mile of the shore; for they had weighed her anchor as
soon as they were masters of her, and the weather being fair,
had brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of the little
creek, and the tide being up, the captain had brought the pinnace
in near the place where I at first landed my rafts, and so landed
just at my door.
I was at first ready to sink down with the surprise; for I
saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things
easy, and a large ship just ready to carry me away whither I
pleased to go. At first, for some time, I was not able to answer
him one word; but as he had taken me in his arms, I held fast
by him, or I should have fallen to the ground.
He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulls a bottle
out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which he had
brought on purpose for me. After I had drank it, I sat down
upon the ground; and though it brought me to myself, yet it
was a good while before I could speak a word to him.
All this while the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I,
only not under any surprise, as I was; and he said a thousand
kind tender things to me, to compose me and bring me to my-
self. But such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put
all my spirits into confusion. At last it broke out into tears,
and in a little while after I recovered my speech.
Then I took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer,
and we rejoiced together. I told him I looked upon him as a
man sent from heaven to deliver me, and that the whole trans-
action seemed to be a chain of wonders; that such things as
these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand of Providence
governing the world, and an evidence that the eyes of an infinite
Power could search into the remotest corner of the world, and
send help to the miserable whenever He pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to heaven;
and what heart could forbear to bless Him, who had not only
in a miraculous manner provided for one in such a wilderness,
and in such a desolate condition, but from whom every deliver-
ance must always be acknowledged to proceed?
When we had talked a while, the captain told me he had
brought me some little refreshment, such as the ship afforded,
and such as the wretches that had been so long his masters had
not plundered him of. Upon this he called aloud to the boat,
and bid his men bring the things ashore that were for the
governor; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had been one,
not that was to be carried away along with them, but as if I had
been to dwell upon the island still.and they were to go without me.
First, he had brought me a case of bottles full of excellent
cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira wine (the bottles
held two quarts apiece), two pounds of excellent good tobacco,
twelve good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork,
with a bag of peas, and about a hundredweight of biscuit
.
He brought me also a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full
of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of other
things; but besides these, and what was a thousand times more
useful to me, he brought me six clean new shirts, six very good
neck-cloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one
pair of stockings, and a very good suit of clothes of his own,
which had been worn but very little; in a word, he clothed me
from head to foot.
It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one may
imagine, to one in my circumstances; but never was anything
in the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy,
as it was to me to wear such clothes at their first putting on.
After these ceremonies passed, and after all his good things
were brought into my little apartment, we began to consult
what was to be done with the prisoners we had; for it was worth
considering whether we might venture to take them away with
us or no, especially two of them, whom we knew to be incor-
rigible and refractory to the last degree; and the captain said
he knew they were such rogues, that there was no obliging
them; and if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as
malefactors, to be delivered over to justice at the first English
colony he could come at; and I found that the captain himself
was very anxious about it.
Upon this I told him that, if he desired it, I durst undertake
to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own request
that he should leave them upon the island. "I should be very
glad of that," says the captain, " with all my heart."
"Well," says I, "I will send for them up, and talk with
them for you." So I caused Friday and the two hostages, for
they were now discharged, their comrades having performed
their promise; I say, I caused them to go to the cave and bring
up the five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep
them there till I came.
After some time I came thither, dressed in my new habit;
and now I was called governor again. Being all met, and the
captain with me, I caused the men to be brought before me,
and I told them I had had a full account of their villainous
behaviour to the captain, and how they had run away with the
ship, and were preparing to commit farther robberies, but that
Providence had ensnared them in their own ways, and that they
were fallen into the pit which they had digged for others.
I let them know that by my direction the ship had been
seized, that she lay now in the road, and they might see, by and
by, that their new captain had received the reward of his villainy,
for that they might see him hanging at the yard-arm; that as
to them, I wanted to know what they had to say why I should
not execute them as pirates, taken in the fact, as by my commis-
sion they could not doubt I had authority to do.
One of them answered in the name of the rest that they had
nothing to say but this, that when they were taken the captain
promised them their lives, and they humbly implored my mercy.
But I told them I knew not what mercy to show them; for as
for myself, I had resolved to quit the island with all my men,
and had taken passage with the captain to go for England. And
as for the captain, he could not carry them to England other
than as prisoners in irons, to be tried for mutiny, and running
away with the ship; the consequence of which, they must needs
know, would be the gallows ; so that I could not tell which was
best for them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in the
island. If they desired that, I did not care, as I had liberty to
leave it, I had some inclination to give them their lives, if
they thought they could shift on shore.
They seemed very thankful for it, said they would much
rather venture to stay there than to be carried to England to be
hanged; so I left it on that issue.
However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it,
as if he durst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed a
little angry with the captain, and told him that they were my
prisoners, not his; and that seeing I had offered them so much
favour, I would be as good as my word; and that if he did not
think fit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty, as I found
them; and if he did not like it, he might take them again if he
could catch them.
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I accordingly
set them at liberty, and bade them retire into the woods to the
place whence they came, and I would leave them some fire-
arms, some ammunition, and some directions how they should
live very well, if they thought fit.
Upon this I prepared to go on board the ship, but told the
captain that I would stay that night to prepare my things, and
desired him to go on board in the meantime, and keep all right
in the ship, and send the boat on shore the next day for me;
ordering him, in the meantime, to cause the new captain, who
was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men might
see him.
When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me to
my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with them
of their circumstances. I told them I thought they had made
a right choice; that if the captain carried them away, they would
certainly be hanged. I showed them the new captain hanging
at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had nothing less
to expect.
When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I
then told them I would let them into the story of my living
there, and put them into the way of making it easy to them.
Accordingly I gave them the whole history of the place, and of
my coming to it, showed them my fortifications, the way I made
my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes; and in a word,
all that was necessary to make them easy. I told them the
story also of the sixteen Spaniards that were to be expected,
for whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them
in common with themselves.
I left them my firearms, viz., five muskets, three fowling-
pieces, and three swords. I had above a barrel and half of
powder left; for after the first year or two I used but little, and
wasted none. I gave them a description of the way I managed
the goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, and to make
both butter and cheese.
In a word, I gave them every part of my own story, and I
told them I would prevail with the captain to leave them two
barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden seeds, which I
told them I would have been very glad of. Also I gave them
the bag of peas which the captain had brought me to eat, and
bade them be sure to sow and increase them.
Having done all this, I left them the next day, and went on
board the ship. We prepared immediately to sail, but did not
weigh that night. The next morning early two of the five men
I SHOWED THEM THE NEW CAPTAIN HANGING AT THE YARD-ARK"
came swimming to the ship's side, and making a most lament-
able complaint of the other three, begged to be taken into the
ship for God's sake, for they should be murdered,- and begged
the captain to take them on board, though he hanged them
immediately.
Upon this the captain pretended to have no power without
me; but after some difficulty, and after their solemn promises of
amendment, they were taken on board, and were some time after
soundly whipped and pickled, after which they proved very
honest and quiet fellows.
Some time after this the boat was ordered on shore, the tide
being up, with the things promised to the men, to which the
captain, at my intercession, caused their chests and clothes to
be added, which they took, and were very thankful for. I also
encouraged them by telling them that if it lay in my way to
send any vessel to take them in, I would not forget them.
When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for
relics, the great goatskin cap I had made, my umbrella, and my
parrot; also I forgot not to take the money I formerly men-
tioned, which had lain by me so long useless that it was grown
rusty or tarnished, and could hardly pass for silver till it had
been a little rubbed and handled; as also the money I found in
the wreck of the Spanish ship.
And thus I left the island, the ipth of December, as I found
by the ship's account, in the year 1686, after I had been upon it
eight and twenty years, two months, and nineteen days, being
delivered from this second captivity the same day of the month
that I first made my escape in the barco-longo, from among the
Moors of Sallee.
In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in England, the
I Ith of June, in the year 1687, having been thirty and five years
absent.
When I came to England, I was as perfect a stranger to all
the world as if I had never been known there. My benefactor
and faithful steward, whom I had left in trust with my money,
was alive, but had had great misfortunes in the world, was
become a widow the second time, and very low in the world.
I made her easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would
give her no trouble; but on the contrary, in gratitude to her
former care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little
stock would afford; which, at that time, would indeed allow
me to do but little for her; but I assured her I would never
forget her former kindness to me, nor did I forget her when I
had sufficient to help her, as shall be observed in its place.
I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my father was
dead, and my mother and all the family extinct, except that I
found two sisters, and two of the children of one of my
brothers; and as I had been long ago given over for dead,
there had been no provision made for me; so that, in a
word, I found nothing to relieve or assist me; and that little
money I had would not do much for me as to settling in the
world.
I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not
expect; and this was, that the master of the ship whom I had
so happily delivered, and by the same means saved the ship
and cargo, having given a very handsome account to the
owners of the manner how I had saved the lives of the men,
and the ship, they invited me to meet them, and some other
merchants concerned, and all together made me a very hand-
some compliment upon the subject, and a present of almost
£200 sterling.
But after making several reflections upon the circumstances
of my life, and how little way this would go towards settling
me in the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might
not come by some information of the state of my plantation in
the Brazils, and of what was become of my partner, who I had
reason to suppose had some years now given me over for dead.
With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived
in April following; my man Friday accompanying me very
honestly in all these ramblings, and proving a most faithful
servant upon all occasions.
When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and to my
particular satisfaction, my old friend the captain of the ship
who first took me up at sea off of the shore of Africa. He was
now grown old, and had left off the sea, having put his son,
who was far from a young man, into his ship, and who still used
the Brazil trade. The old man did not know me; and, indeed,
I hardly knew him; but I soon brought him to my remem-
brance, and as soon brought myself to his remembrance, when
I told him who I was.
After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance,
I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my
partner. The old man told me he had not been in the Brazils
for about nine years; but that he could assure me that, when
he came away, my partner was living; but the trustees, whom
I had joined with him to take cognisance of my part, were both
dead. That, however, he believed that I would have a very
good account of the improvement of the plantation; for that
upon the general belief of my being cast away and drowned,
my trustees had given in the account of the produce of my part of
the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, who had appropriated it,
in case I never came to claim it, one-third to the king, and two-
thirds to the monastery of St Augustine, to be expended for
the benefit of the poor, and for the conversion of the Indians
to the Catholic faith; but that if I appeared, or anyone for me
to claim the inheritance, it should be restored; only that the
improvement, or annual production, being distributed to
charitable uses, could not be restored. But he assured me
that the steward of the king's revenue from lands, and the
provedidore, or steward of the monastery, had taken great care
all along that the incumbent, that is to say, my partner, gave
every year a faithful account of the produce, of which they
received duly my moiety.
I asked him if he knew to what height of improvement he
had brought the plantation, and whether he thought it might
be worth looking after; or whether, on my going thither, I
should meet with no obstruction to my possessing my just right
in the moiety.
He told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the
plantation was improved; but this he knew, that my partner was
growing exceeding rich upon the enjoying but one-half of it;
and that, to the best of his remembrance, he had heard that the
king's third of my part, which was, it seems, granted away to
some other monastery or religious house, amounted to above
two hundred moidores a year. That as to my being restored
to a quiet possession of it, there was no question to be made of
that, my partner being alive to witness my title, and my name
being also enrolled in the register of the country. Also he told
me that the survivors of my two trustees were very fair, honest
people, and very wealthy; and he believed I would not only
have their assistance for putting me in possession, but would
find a very considerable sum of money in their hands for my
account, being the produce of the farm while their fathers held
the trust, and before it was given up, as above; which, as he
remembered, was for about twelve years.
I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this
account, and inquired of the old captain how it came to pass
that the trustees should thus dispose my effects, when he knew
that I had made my will, and had made him, the Portuguese
captain, my universal heir, etc.
He told me, that was true; but that as there was no proof
of my being dead, he could not act as executor until some
certain account should come of my death; and that besides, he
was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote; that it
was true he had registered my will, and put in his claim; and
could he have given any account of my being dead or alive, he
would have acted by procuration, and taken possession of the
ingenio, so they called the sugar-house, and had given his son,
who was now at the Brazils, order to do it.
"But," says the old man, " I have one piece of news to tell
you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the
rest; and that is, that believing you were lost, and all the
world believing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to
account to me, in your name, for six or eight of the first years
of profits, which I received; but there being at that time," says
he " great disbursements for increasing the works, building an
ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to near so much as
afterwards it produced. However," says the old man, " I shall
give you a true account of what I have received in all, and
how I have disposed of it."
After a few days' farther conference with this ancient friend,
he brought me an account of the six first years' income of my
plantation, signed by my partner and the merchant-trustees,
being always delivered in goods, viz., tobacco in roll, and sugar
in chests, besides rum, molasses, etc., which is the consequence
of a sugar-work; and I found, by this account, that every year
the income considerably increased; but, as above, the disburse-
ment being large, the sum at first was small. However, the old
man let me see that he was debtor to me 470 moidores of gold,
besides 60 chests of sugar, and 15 double rolls of tobacco,
which were lost in his ship, he having been shipwrecked coming
home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my leaving the place.
The good man then began to complain of his misfortunes,
and how he had been obliged to make use of my money to
recover his losses, and buy him a share in a new ship. "How-
ever, my old friend," says he, "you shall not want a supply in
your necessity; and as soon as my son returns, you shall be
fully satisfied."
Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me 160
Portugal moidores in gold; and giving me the writing of his
title to the ship, which his son was gone to the Brazils in, of
which he was a quarter-part owner, and his son another, he puts
them both into my hands for security of the rest.
I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the
poor man to be able to bear this; and remembering what he
had done for me, how he had taken me up at sea, and how
generously he had used me on all occasions, and particularly
how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain
weeping at what he said to me; therefore first I asked him
if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much money
at that time, and if it would not straiten him? He told me he
could not say but it might straiten him a little; but, however,
it was my money, and I might want it more than he.
Everything the good man said was full of affection, and I
could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke; in short, I
took 100 of the moidores, and called for a pen and ink to give
him a receipt for them. Then I returned him the rest, and told
him if ever I had possession of the plantation, I would return
the other to him also, as, indeed, I afterwards did; and that as
to the bill of sale of his part in his son's ship, I would not take
it by any means; but that if I wanted the money, I found he
was honest enough to pay me; and if I did not, but came to
receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would never have
a penny more from him.
When this was passed, the old man began to ask me if he
should put me into a method to make my claim to my planta-
tion? I told him I thought to go over to it myself. He said I
might do so if I pleased; but that if I did not, there were ways
enough to secure my right, and immediately to appropriate the
profits to my use; and as there were ships in the river of
Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my
name in a public register, with his affidavit, affirming, upon
oath, that I was alive, and that I was the same person who
took up the land for the planting the said plantation at
first.
This being regularly attested by a notary, and a procuration
affixed, he directed me to send it, with a letter of his writing, to
a merchant of his acquaintance at the place, and then proposed
my staying with him till an account came of the return.
Never anything was more honourable than the proceedings
upon this procuration; for in less than seven months I received
a large packet from the survivors of my trustees, the merchants,
for whose account I went to sea, in which were the following
particular letters and papers enclosed.
First, there was the account-current of the produce of my
farm or plantation from the year when their fathers had
balanced with my old Portugal captain, being for six years;
the balance appeared to be 1174 moidores in my favour.
Secondly, there was the account of four years more, while
they kept the effects in their hands, before the government
claimed the administration, as being the effects of a person not
to be found, which they called civil death; and the balance of
this, the value of the plantation increasing, amounted to 38,892
crusadoes, which made 3241 moidores.
Thirdly, there was the prior of the Augustines'account, who
had received the profits for above fourteen years; but not
being to account for what was disposed to the hospital, very
honestly declared he had 872 moidores not distributed, which
he acknowledged to my account; as to the king's part, that
refunded nothing.
There was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me very
affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account how
the estate was improved, and what it produced a year, with a
particular of the number of squares or acres that it contained;
how planted, how many slaves there were upon it, and making
two and twenty crosses for blessings, told me he had said so
many Ave Marias to thank the blessed Virgin that I was alive;
inviting me very passionately to come over and take possession
of my own; and in the meantime, to give him orders to whom
he should deliver my effects, if I did not come myself; con-
cluding with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his
family; and sent me as a present seven fine leopards' skins,
which he had, it seems, received from Africa by some other
ship which he had sent thither, and who, it seems, had made a
better voyage than I. He sent me also five chests of excellent
sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so
large as moidores. By the same fleet, my two merchant
trustees shipped me 1200 chests of sugar, 800 rolls of tobacco,
and the rest of the whole account in gold.
I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was
better than the beginning. It is impossible to express the
flutterings of my very heart when I looked over these letters,
and especially when I found all my wealth about me; for as
the Brazil ships come all in fleets, the same ships which brought
my letters brought my goods, and the effects were safe in the
river before the letters came to my hand. In a word, I turned
pale, and grew sick; and had not the old man run and fetched
me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had overset
Nature, and I had died upon the spot.
Nay, after that I continued very ill, and was so some hours,
till a physician being sent for, and something of the real cause
of my illness being known, he ordered me to be let blood, after
which I had relief, and grew well; but I verily believe, if it had
not been eased by a vent given in that manner to the spirits, I
should have died.
I was now master, all on a sudden, of above £5000 sterling
in money, and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the
Brazils of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an estate
of lands in England; and in a word, I was in a condition which
I scarce knew how to understand, or how to compose myself
for the enjoyment of it.
The first thing I did was to recompense my original bene-
factor, my good old captain, who had been first charitable to me
in my distress, kind to me in my beginning, and honest to me
at the end. I showed him all that was sent me. I told him
that, next to the providence of Heaven, which disposes all
things, it was owing to him; and that it now lay on me to
reward him, which I would do a hundredfold. So I first re-
turned to him the hundred moidores I had received of him;
then I sent for a notary, and caused him to draw up a general
release or discharge for the 470 moidores which he had
acknowledged he owed me in the fullest and firmest manner
possible; after which I caused a procuration to be drawn, em-
powering him to be my receiver of the annual profits of my
plantation, and appointing my partner to account to him, and
make the returns by the usual fleets to him in my name; and
a clause in the end, being a grant of 100 moidores a year to
him, during his life, out of the effects, and 50 moidores a year
to his son after him, for his life; and thus I requited my old
man.
I was now to consider which way to steer my course next,
and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put
into my hands; and, indeed, I had more care upon my head now
than I had in my silent state of life in the island, where I wanted
nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what I wanted;
whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and my business
was how to secure it. I had ne'er a cave now to hide my
money in, or a place where it might lie without lock or key till
it grew mouldy and tarnished before anybody would meddle
with it. On the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom
to trust with it. My old patron, the captain, indeed, was honest,
and that was the only refuge I had.
In the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to sum-
mon me thither; but now I could not tell how to think of going
thither till I had settled my affairs, and left my effects in some
safe hands behind me. At first I thought of my old friend the
widow, who I knew was honest, and would be just to me; but
then she was in years, and but poor, and for aught I knew might
be in debt; so that, in a word, I had no way but to go back to
England myself, and take my effects with me.
It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this;
and therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to
his satisfaction, who had been my former benefactor, so I began
to think of my poor widow, whose husband had been my first
benefactor, and she, while it was in her power, my faithful
steward and instructor. So the first thing I did, I got a mer-
chant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in London, not
only to pay a bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in
money an hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her, and
comfort her in her poverty, by telling her she should, if I lived,
have a further supply. At the same time I sent my two sisters
in the country each of them an hundred pounds, they being,
though not in want, yet not in very good circumstances; one
having been married, and left a widow; and the other having a
husband not so kind to her as he should be.
But among all my relations or acquaintances, I could not yet
pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock,
that I might go away to the Brazils, and leave things safe behind
me; and this greatly perplexed me.
I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils and have
settled myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalised to the
place. But I had some little scruple in my mind about religion,
which insensibly drew me back, of which I shall say more pre-
sently. However, it was not religion that kept me from going
there for the present; and as I had made no scruple of being
openly of the religion of the country all the while I was among
them, so neither did I yet; only that, now and then, having of
late thought more of it than formerly, when I began to think of
living and dying among them, I began to regret my having pro-
fessed myself a papist, and thought it might not be the best
religion to die with.
But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me
from going to the Brazils, but that really I did not know with
whom to leave my effects behind me; so I resolved, at last, to
go to England with it, where, if I arrived, I concluded I should
make some acquaintance, or find some relations, that would be
faithful to me; and accordingly I prepared to go for England
with all my wealth.
In order to prepare things for my going home, I first, the
Brazil fleet being just going away, resolved to give answers
suitable to the just and faithful account of things I had from
thence. And first, to the prior of St Augustine I wrote a letter
full of thanks for their just dealings, and the offer of the 872
moidores which was undisposed of, which I desired might be
given, 500 to the monastery, and 372 to the poor, as the prior
should direct, desiring the good padre's prayers for me, and the
like.
I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all
the acknowledgment that so much justice and honesty called
for. As for sending them any present, they were far above
having any occasion of it.
Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry
in the improving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing
the stock of the works, giving him instructions for his future
government of my part,according to the powers I had left with
my old patron, to whom I desired him to send whatever became
due to me till he should hear from me more particularly; assur-
ing him that it was my intention not only to come to him, but
to settle myself there for the remainder of my life. To this I
added a very handsome present of some Italian silks for his
wife and two daughters.
Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned
all my effects into good bills of exchange, my next difficulty
was which way to go to England. I had been accustomed
enough to the sea, and yet I had a strange aversion to going to
England by sea at that time; and though I could give no reason
for it, yet the difficulty increased upon me so much, that though
I had once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I altered
my mind, and that not once, but two or three times.
It is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might
be some of the reason ; but let no man slight the strong impulses
of his own thoughts in cases of such moment. Two of the ships
which I had singled out to go in, I mean more particularly
singled out than any other, that is to say, so as in one of them
to put my things on board, and in the other to have agreed with
the captain; I say, two of these ships miscarried, viz., one was
taken by the Algerines, and the other was cast away on the
Start, near Torbay, and all the people drowned except three;
so that in either of those vessels I had been made miserable;
and in which most, it was hard to say.
Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to
whom I communicated everything, pressed me earnestly not to
go by sea, but either to go by land to the Groyne, and cross
over the Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was but an
easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais and
Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the way by land
through France.
In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going by sea
at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I resolved to travel all
the way by land ; which, as I was not in haste, and did not
value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way. And to
make it more so, my old captain brought an English gentleman,
the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel
with me; after which we picked up two more English merchants
also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to
Paris only; so that we were in all six of us, and five servants;
the two merchants and the two Portuguese contenting them-
selves with one servant between two, to save the charge; and
as for me, I got an English sailor to travel with me as a
servant, besides my man Friday, who was too much a stranger
to be capable of supplying the place of a servant on the
road.
In this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our company,
being all very well mounted and armed, we made a little troop,
whereof they did me the honour to call me captain, as well
because I was the oldest man as because I had two servants, and
indeed was the original of the whole journey.
As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so I
shall trouble you now with none of my land journal; but
some adventures that happened to us in this tedious and
difficult journey I must not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we being all of us strangers to
Spain, were willing to stay some time to see the court of Spain,
and to see what was worth observing; but it being the latter
part of the summer we hastened away, and set out from Madrid
about the middle of October; but when we came to the edge
of Navarre, we were alarmed at several towns on the way with
an account that so much snow was fallen on the French side
of the mountains, that several travellers were obliged to come
back to Pampeluna, after have attempted, at an extreme hazard,
to pass on.
When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed;
and to me, that had been always used to a hot climate, and
indeed to countries where we could scarce bear any clothes on,
the cold was insufferable; nor indeed was it more painful than
it was surprising to come but ten days before out of the Old
Castile, where the weather was not only warm, but very hot, and
immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean mountains so
very keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger
benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the mountains
all covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had
never seen or felt before in his life.
To mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna it con-
tinued snowing with so much violence, and so long, that the
people said winter was come before its time; and the roads,
which were difficult before, were now quite impassable; for, in
a word, the snow lay in some places too thick for us to travel,
and being not hard frozen, as is the case in northern countries,
there was no going without being in danger of being buried
alive every step. We stayed no less than twenty days at
Pampeluna; when seeing the winter coming on, and no likeli-
hood of its being better, for it was the severest winter all over
Europe that had been known in the memory of man, I proposed
that we should all go away to Fontarabia, and there take
shipping for Bordeaux, which was a very little voyage.
But while we were considering this, there came in four French
gentlemen, who having been stopped on the French side of the
passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who,
traversing the country near the head of Languedoc, had brought
them over the mountains by such ways, that they were not
much incommoded with the snow; and where they met with
snow in any quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to
bear them and their horses.
We sent for this guide, who told us he would undertake to
carry us the same way with no hazard from the snow, provided
we were armed sufficiently to protect us from wild beasts; for
he said, upon these great snows it was frequent for some wolves
to show themselves at the foot of the mountains, being made
ravenous for want of food, the ground being covered with snow.
We told him we were well enough prepared for such creatures
as they were, if he would ensure us from a kind of two-legged
wolves, which, we were told, we were in most danger from,
especially on the French side of the mountains.
He satisfied us there was no danger of that kind in the way
that we were to go; so we readily agreed to follow him, as did
also twelve other gentlemen, with their servants, some French,
some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were
obliged to come back again.
Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna, with our guide,
on the 15th of November; and, indeed, I was surprised when,
instead of going forward, he came directly back with us on the
same road that we came from Madrid, above twenty miles;
when being passed two rivers, and come into the plain country,
we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the country
was pleasant, and no snow to be seen ; but on a sudden, turning
to his left, he approached the mountains another way; and
though it is true the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he
made so many tours, such meanders, and led us by such winding
ways, that we were insensibly passed the height of the moun-
tains without being much encumbered with the snow; and all
on a sudden he showed us the pleasant fruitful provinces of
Languedoc and Gascoign, all green and flourishing, though, in-
deed, it was at a great distance, and we had some rough way to
pass yet.
We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed
one whole day and a night so fast, that we could not travel; but
he bid us be easy, we should soon be past it all. We found
indeed, that we began to descend every day, and to come more
north than before; and so, depending upon our guide, we
went on.
It was about two hours before night when, our guide being
something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three
monstrous wolves, and after them a bear, out of a hollow way
adjoining to a thick wood. Two of the wolves flew upon the
guide, and had he been half a mile before us he had been de-
voured indeed before we could have helped him. One of them
fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with
that violence, that he had not time, or not presence of mind
enough, to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us most
lustily. My man Friday being next to me, I bid him ride up,
and see what was the matter. As soon as Friday came in sight
of the man, he hallooed as loud as t'other, "O master! O
master!" but, like a bold fellow, rode directly up to the poor
man, and with his pistol shot the wolf that attacked him into
the head.
It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday,
for he having been used to that kind of creature in his country,
had no fear upon him, but went close up to him and shot him,
as above; whereas any of us would have fired at a farther dis-
tance, and have perhaps either missed the wolf, or endangered
shooting the man.
But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I;
and, indeed, it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise
of Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides the dismallest howl-
ing of wolves; and the noise, redoubled by the echo of the
mountains, that it was to us as if there had been a prodigious
multitude of them; and perhaps indeed there was not such a
few as that we had no cause of apprehensions.
However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other that had
fastened upon the horse left him immediately and fled, having
happily fastened upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle
had stuck in his teeth, so that he had not done him much hurt.
The man indeed was most hurt; for the raging creature had
bit him twice, once on the arm, and the other time a little above
his knee; and he was just as it were tumbling down by the
disorder of his horse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf.
It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol we
all mended our pace, and rid up as fast as the way, which was
very difficult, would give us leave, to see what was the matter.
As soon as we came clear of the trees, which blinded us before,
we saw clearly what had been the case, and how Friday had
disengaged the poor guide, though we did not presently discern
what kind of creature it was he had killed.
But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a
surprising manner, as that which followed between Friday and
WITH HIS PISTOL SHOT THE WOL».
the bear, which gave us all, though at first we were surprised
and afraid for him, the greatest diversion imaginable. As the
bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the
wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has two particular
qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions: first, as to
men, who are not his proper prey; I say, not his proper prey,
because, though I cannot say what excessive hunger might do,
which was now their case, the ground being all covered with
snow; but as to men, he does not usually attempt them, unless
they first attack him. On the contrary, if you meet him in the
woods, if you don't meddle with him, he won't meddle with
you; but then you must take care to be very civil to him, and
give him the road, for he is a very nice gentleman. He won't
go a step out of his way for a prince; nay, if you are really
afraid, your best way is to look another way, and keep going on;
for sometimes if you stop, and stand still, and look steadily at
him, he takes it for an affront; but if you throw or toss any-
thing at him, and it hits him, though it were but a bit of a stick as
big as your finger, he takes it for an affront, and sets all his other
business aside to pursue his revenge; for he will have satisfac-
tion in point of honour. That is his first quality; the next is,
that if he be once affronted, he will never leave you, night or
day, till he has his revenge, but follows, at a good round rate,
till he overtakes you.
My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came
up to him he was helping him off from his horse; for the man
was both hurt and frighted, and indeed the last more than the
first; when, on the sudden, we spied the bear come out of the
wood, and a vast monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that
ever I saw. We were all a little surprised when we saw him;
but when Friday saw him, it was easy to see joy and courage in
the fellow's countenance. "O! O! O!" says Friday, three
times pointing to him. "O master !you give me te leave; me
shakee te hand with him; me make you good laugh."
I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased. "You fool you,"
says I, " he will eat you up." "Eatee me up! eatee me up!"
says Friday, twice over again; "me eatee him up; me make
you good laugh; you all stay here, me show you good laugh."
So down he sits, and gets his boots off in a moment, and put on
a pair of pumps, as we call the flat shoes they wear, and which
he had in his pocket, gives my other servant his horse, and with
his gun away he flew, swift like the wind.
The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with
nobody till Friday, coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the
bear could understand him, " Hark ye, hark ye," says Friday,
"me speakee wit you." We followed at a distance; for now
being come down on the Gascoign side of the mountains, we
were entered a vast great forest, where the country was plain
and pretty open, though many trees in it scattered here and
there.
Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up
with him quickly, and takes up a great stone and throws at him,
and hit him just on the head, but did him no more harm than
if he had thrown it against a wall. But it answered Friday's
end, for the rogue was so void of fear, that he did it purely to
make the bear follow him, and show us some laugh, as he called it.
As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, he turns
about, and comes after him, taking devilish long strides, and
shuffling along at a strange rate, so as would have put a horse
to a middling gallop. Away runs Friday, and takes his course
as if he run towards us for help; so we all resolved to fire at
once upon the bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry
at him heartily for bringing the bear back upon us, when he
was going about his own business another way; and especially
I was angry that he had turned the bear upon us, and then run
away; and I called out," You dog," said I, "is this your making
us laugh? Come away, and take your horse, that we may shoot
the creature." He hears me, and cries out," No shoot, no shoot;
stand still, you get much laugh." And as the nimble creature
run two feet for the beast's one, he turned on a sudden, on one
side of us, and seeing a great oak tree fit for his purpose, he
beckoned to us to follow; and doubling his pace, he gets nimbly
up the tree, laying his gun down upon the ground, at about five
or six yards from the bottom of the tree.
The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a
distance. The first thing he did, he stopped at the gun, smelt
to it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing
like a cat, though so monstrously heavy. I was amazed at the
folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could not for my life see
anything to laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we
all rode nearer to him.
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the
small end of a large limb of the tree, and the bear got about
half way to him. As soon as the bear got out to that part
where the limb of the tree was weaker, " Ha!" says he to us,
"now you see me teachee the bear dance." So he falls a-jump-
ing and shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter,
but stood still, and began to look behind him, to see how he
should get back. Then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. But
Friday had not done with him by a great deal. When he sees
him stand still, he calls out to him again, as if he had supposed
the bear could speak English, "What, you no come farther?
pray you come farther"; so he left jumping and shaking the
tree; and the bear, just as if he had understood what he said,
did come a little farther; then he fell a-jumping again, and the
bear stopped again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him on the head,
and I called to Friday to stand still, and we would shoot the
bear; but he cried out earnestly," O pray! O pray! no shoot, me
shoot by and then "; he would have said by-and-by. However,
to shorten the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood
so ticklish, that we had laughing enough indeed, but still could
not imagine what the fellow would do: for first we thought he
depended upon shaking the bear off; and we found the bear
was too cunning for that too; for he would not go out far
enough to be thrown down, but clings fast with his great broad
claws and feet, so that we could not imagine what would be the
end of it, and where the jest would be at last
.
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for seeing the bear
cling fast to the bough, and that he would not be persuaded to
come any farther, "Well, well," says Friday, "you no come
farther, me go, me go; you no come to me, me go come to
you"; and upon this he goes out to the smallest end of the
bough, where it would bend with his weight, and gently lets
himself down by it, sliding down the bough till he came near
enough to jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun,
takes it up, and stands still,
_
P_^-S.'T^"i > S-—
WELL .WELL.YOU NO COME FARTHER.A\E GO'
"Well," said I to him, "Friday, what will you do now?
Why don't you shoot him?" "No shoot," says Friday, "no
yet; me shoot now, me no kill; me stay, give you one more
laugh." And, indeed, so he did, as you will see presently; for
when the bear sees his enemy gone, he comes back from the
bough where he stood, but did it mighty leisurely, looking
behind him every step, and coming backward till he got into
the body of the tree; then with the same hinder end foremost
he comes down the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving
one foot at a time, very leisurely. At this juncture, and just
before he could set his hind feet upon the ground, Friday stepped
up close to him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear,
and shot him dead as a stone.
Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not laugh; and
when he saw we were pleased by our looks, he falls a-laughing
himself very loud. "So we kill bear in my country," says
Friday. "So you kill them?" says I; "why, you have no
guns." "No," says he, "no gun, but shoot great much long
arrow."
This was indeed a good diversion to us; but we were still in
a wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and what to do we
hardly knew. The howling of wolves ran much in my head;
and indeed, except the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa,
of which I have said something already, I never heard anything
that filled me with so much horror.
These things, and the approach of night, called us off, or
else, as Friday would have had us, we should certainly have
taken the skin of this monstrous creature off, which was worth
saving; but we had three leagues to go, and our guide hastened
us; so we left him, and went forward on our journey.
The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep
and dangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures,
as we heard afterwards, were come down into the forest and
plain country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done
a great deal of mischief in the villages, where they surprised the
country people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses,
and some people too.
We had one dangerous place to pass, which our guide told
us if there were any more wolves in the country we should find
them there; and this was in a small plain, surrounded with
woods on every side, and a long narrow defile, or lane, which we
were to pass to get through the wood, and then we should come
to the village where we were to lodge. We had but little more
than loaded our fusees, and put ourselves into a readiness, when
we heard a terrible noise in the same wood, on our left, only
that it was further onward, the same way we were to go.
The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky,
which made it worse on our side; but the noise increasing, we
could easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling of those
hellish creatures; and on a sudden, we perceived two or three
troops of volves, one on our left, one behind us, and one on our
front, so that we seemed to be surrounded with them. However,
as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way forward as fast as
we could make our horses go, which, the way being very rough,
was only a good large trot, and in this manner we came in view
of the entrance of a wood, through which we were to pass, at
the farther side of the plain; but we were greatly surprised
when, coming nearer the lane, or pass, we saw a confused number
of wolves standing just at the entrance.
On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard the
noise of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a horse, with
a saddle and a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen
or seventeen wolves after him, full speed; indeed, the horse
had the heels of them; but as we supposed that he could not
hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they would get up with
him at last, and no question but they did.
But here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up to the
entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcass of
another horse and of two men, devoured by the ravenous
creatures; and one of the men was no doubt the same whom
we heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off;
but as to the man, his head and the upper part of his body was
eaten up.
This filled us with horror, and we knew not what course to
take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered
about us presently in hopes of prey, and I verily believe there
were three hundred of them. It happened very much to our
advantage that, at the entrance into the wood, but a little way

ORDERED OUR MEN TO FINE.
from it, there lay some large timber-trees, which had been cut
down the summer before, and I suppose lay there for carriage.
I drew my little troop in among those trees, and placing our-
selves in a line behind one long tree, I advised them all to light,
and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork, to stand in a
triangle, or three fronts, enclosing our horses in the centre.
We did so, and it was well we did; for never was a more
furious charge than the creatures made upon us in the place.
They came on us with a growling kind of a noise, and mounted
the piece of timber, which, as I said, was our breastwork, as if
they were only rushing upon their prey; and this fury of theirs,
it seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing our horses
behind us, which was the prey they aimed at. I ordered our
men to fire as before, every other man; and they took their
aim so sure, that indeed they killed several of the wolves at
the first volley; but there was a necessity to keep a continual
firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing on
those before.
When we had fired our second volley of our fusees, we
thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they would have
gone off; but it was but a moment, for others came forward
again; so we fired two volleys of our pistols; and I believe in
these four firings we had killed seventeen or eighteen of them,
and lamed twice as many, yet they came on again.
I was loth to spend our last shot too hastily; so I called
my servant, not my man Friday, for he was better employed,
for with the greatest dexterity imaginable he had charged my
fusee and his own while we were engaged; but as I said, I
called my other man, and giving him a horn of powder, I bade
him lay a train all along the piece of timber, and let it be a
large train. He did so, and had but just time to get away
when the wolves came up to it, and some were got up upon it,
when I, snapping an uncharged pistol close to the powder, set
it on fire. Those that were upon the timber were scorched
with it, and six or seven of them fell, or rather jumped, in
among us with the force and fright of the fire. We despatched
these in an instant, and the rest were so frighted with the light,
which the night, for it was now very near dark, made more
terrible, that they drew back a little; upon which I ordered
our last pistol to be fired off in one volley, and after that we
gave a shout. Upon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied
immediately upon near twenty lame ones, whom we found
struggling on the ground, and fell a-cutting them with our
swords, which answered our expectation; for the crying and
howling they made was better understood by their fellows, so
that they all fled and left us.
We had, first and last, killed about threescore of them, and
had it been daylight, we had killed many more. The field of
battle being thus cleared, we made forward again, for we had
still near a league to go. We heard the ravenous creatures
howl and yell in the woods as we went several times, and some-
times we fancied we saw some of them, but the snow dazzling
our eyes, we were not certain. So in about an hour more we
came to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in a
terrible fright, and all in arms; for it seems that the night
before the wolves and some bears had broke into the village
in the night, and put them in a terrible fright; and they were
obliged to keep guard night and day, but especially in the
night, to preserve their cattle, and, indeed, their people.
The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled
with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no
farther; so we were obliged to take a new guide there, and go
to Toulouse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant
country, and no snow, no wolves, or anything like them. But
when we told our story at Toulouse, they told us it was nothing
but what was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the
mountains, especially when the snow lay on the ground; but
they inquired much what kind of a guide we had gotten that
would venture to bring us that way in such a severe season,
and told us it was very much we were not all devoured. When
we told them how we placed ourselves, and the horses in the
middle they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to
one but we had been all destroyed ; for it was the sight of the
horses which made the wolves so furious, seeing their prey;
and that, at other times, they are really afraid of a gun; but the
being excessive hungry, and raging on that account, the eager-
ness to come at the horses had made them senseless of danger;
and that if we had not, by the continued fire, and at last by
the stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, it had
been great odds but that we had been torn to pieces; whereas
had we been content to have sat still on horseback, and fired
as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses for so much
their own, when men were on their backs, as otherwise; and
withal they told us, that at last, if we had stood all together,
and left our horses, they would have been so eager to have
devoured them, that we might have come off safe, especially
having our firearms in our hands, and being so many in
number.
For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in my life;
for seeing above three hundred devils come roaring and open-
mouthed to devour us, and having nothing to shelter us or
retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and as it was, I believe
I shall never care to cross those mountains again. I think I
would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I
were sure to meet with a storm once a week.
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage
through France; nothing but what other travellers have given
an account of with much more advantage than I can.
I travelled from Toulouse to Paris, and without any
Q
considerable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover,
the I4th of January, after having had a severe cold season to
travel in.
I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a
little time all my new-discovered estate safe about me, the bills
of exchange which I brought with me having been very
currently paid.
My principal guide and privy councillor was my good ancient
widow; who, in gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought
no pains too much, or care too great, to employ for me; and I
trusted her so entirely with everything, that I was perfectly
easy as to the security of my effects; and indeed I was very
happy from my beginning, and now to the end, in the unspotted
integrity of this good gentlewoman.
And now I began to think of leaving my effects with this
woman and setting out for Lisbon, and so to the Brazils. But
now another scruple came in my way, and that was religion;
for as I had entertained some doubts about the Roman religion
even while I was abroad, especially in my state of solitude, so
I knew there was no going to the Brazils for me, much less
going to settle there, unless I resolved to embrace the Roman
Catholic religion without any reserve; unless on the other hand
I resolved to be a sacrifice to my principles, be a martyr for
religion, and die in the Inquisition. So I resolved to stay at
home, and if I could find means for it, to dispose of my plantation.
To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who in
return gave me notice that he could easily dispose of it there;
but that if I thought fit to give him leave to offer it in my name
to the two merchants, the survivors of my trustees, who lived in
the Brazils, who must fully understand the value of it, who
lived just upon the spot, and whom I knew were very rich, so
that he believed they would be fond of buying it, he did not
doubt but I should make 4000 or 5000 pieces of eight the more
of it.
Accordingly I agreed, gave him order to offer it to them
and he did so; and in about eight months more, the ship being
then returned, he sent me an account that they had accepted
the offer, and had remitted 33,000 pieces of eight to a corre-
spondent of theirs at Lisbon to pay for it.
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form which
they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me
bills of exchange for 32,800 pieces of eight to me, for the estate;
reserving the payment of 100 moidores a year to him, the old
man, during his life, and 50 moidores afterwards to his son for
his life, which I had promised them, which the plantation was to
make good as a rent-charge. And thus I have given the first
part of a life of fortune and adventure, a life of Providence's
chequer-work, and of a variety which the world will seldom be
able to show the like of; beginning foolishly, but closing much
more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so much as
to hope for.
Any one would think that in this state of complicated good
fortune I was past running any more hazards; and so indeed I
had been, if other circumstances had concurred. But I was
inured to a wandering life, had no family, not many relations,
nor, however rich, had I contracted much acquaintance; and
though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not keep
the country out of my head, and had a great mind to be upon
the wing again; especially I could not resist the strong inclina-
tion I had to see my island, and to know if the poor Spaniards
were in being there, and how the rogues I left there had used
them.
My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me from it,
and so far prevailed with me, that for almost seven years she
prevented my running abroad, during which time I took my two
nephews, the children of one of my brothers, into my care.
The eldest having something of his own, I bred up as a gentle-
man, and gave him a settlement of some addition to his estate
after my decease. The other I put out to a captain of a ship,
and after five years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising
young fellow, I put him into a good ship, and sent him to sea;
and this young fellow afterwards drew me in, as old as I was,
to farther adventures myself.
In the meantime, I in part settled myself here; for, first of
all, I married, and that not either to my disadvantage or dis-
satisfaction, and had three children, two sons and one daughter:
but my wife dying, and my nephew coming home with good
success from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to go abroad,
and his importunity, prevailed, and engaged me to go in his
ship as a private trader to the East Indies. This was in the
year 1694.
In this voyage I visited my new colony in the island, saw my
successors the Spaniards, had the whole story of their lives, and
of the villains I left there; how at first they insulted the poor
Spaniards, how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united,
separated, and how at last the Spaniards were obliged to use
violence with them; how they were subjected to the Spaniards;
how honestly the Spaniards used them; a history, if it were
entered into, as full of variety and wonderful accidents as my
own part; particularly also as to their battles with the
Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the island, and as
to the improvement they made upon the island itself; and how
five of them made an attempt upon the mainland, and brought
away eleven men and five women prisoners, by which, at my
coming, I found about twenty young children on the island.
Here I stayed about twenty days, left them supplies of all
necessary things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes,
tools, and two workmen, which I brought from England with
me, viz., a carpenter and a smith.
Besides this, I shared the island into parts with them, re-
served to myself the property of the whole, but gave them such
parts respectively as they agreed on; and having settled all
things with them, and engaged them not to leave the place, I
left them there.
From thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent a
bark, which I bought there, with more people, to the island;
and in it, besides other supplies, I sent seven women, being such
as I found proper for service, or for wives to such as would take
them. As to the Englishmen, I promised them to send them
some women from England, with a good cargo of necessaries,
if they would apply themselves to planting; which I afterwards
performed; and the fellows proved very honest and diligent
after they were mastered, and had their properties set apart
for them. I sent them also from the Brazils five cows, three of
them being big with calf, some sheep, and some hogs, which,
when I came again, were considerably increased.
But all these things, with an account how three hundred
Caribbees came and invaded them, and ruined their plantations,
and how they fought with that whole number twice, and were
at first defeated and three of them killed; but at last a storm
destroying their enemies' canoes, they famished or destroyed
almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the possession
of their plantation, and still lived upon the island ;—all these
things, with some very surprising incidents in some new ad-
ventures of my own, for ten years more, I may perhaps give a
farther account of hereafter.
END OF PART I.
THAT homely proverb used on so many occasions in England,
viz., " That what is bred in the bone will not go out of the flesh,"
was never more verified than in the story of my life. Any one
would think that, after thirty-five years' affliction, and a variety
of unhappy circumstances, which few men, if any, ever went
through before, and after near seven years of peace and enjoy-
ment in the fulness of all things, grown old, and when, if ever,
it might be allowed me to have had experience of every state of
middle life, and to know which was most adapted to make a
man completely happy; I say, after all this, anyone would have
thought that the native propensity to rambling, which I gave an
account of in my first setting out into the world to have been so
predominant in my thoughts, should be worn out, and I might,
at sixty-one years of age, have been a little inclined to stay at
home, and have done venturing life and fortune any more.
Nay, farther, the common motive of foreign adventures was
taken away in me; for I had no fortune to make, I had nothing
to seek. If I had gained ten thousand pounds, I had been no
richer; for I had already sufficient for me, and for those I had
247
to leave it to, and that I had was visibly increasing; so that I
had nothing indeed to do but to sit still and fully enjoy what I
had got, and see it increase daily upon my hands.
Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at least not
enough to resist the strong inclination I had to go abroad again,
which hung about me like a chronical distemper; particularly
the desire of seeing my new plantation in the island, and the
colony I left there, ran in my head continually. I dreamed of
it all night, and my imagination ran upon it all day; it was
uppermost in all my thoughts, and my fancy worked so steadily
and strongly upon it, that I talked of it out of my sleep.
I have often heard persons of good judgment say, that all
the stir people make in the world about ghosts and apparitions
is owing to the strength of imagination, and the powerful opera-
tion of fancy in their minds; that there is no such thing as a
spirit appearing, or a ghost walking, and the like.
For my part, I know not to this hour whether there are any
such things as real apparitions, spectres, or walking of people
after they are dead, or whether there is anything in the stories
they tell us of that kind, more than the product of vapours, sick
minds, and wandering fancies. But this I know, that my
imagination worked up to such a height, and brought me into
such ecstasies of vapours, or what else I may call it, that I actu-
ally supposed myself oftentimes upon the spot, at my old castle
behind the trees, saw my old Spaniard, Friday's father, and the
reprobate sailors I left upon the island; nay, I fancied I talked
with them, and looked at them so steadily, though I was broad
awake, as at persons just before me; and this I did till I often
frighted myself with the images my fancy represented to me.
One time in my sleep I had the villainy of the three pirate
sailors so lively related to me by the first Spaniard and Friday's
father, that it was surprising. They told me how they barbar-
ously attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and that they set
fire to the provisions they had laid up, on purpose to distress
and starve them; things that I had never heard of, and that
indeed were never all of them true in fact; but it was so warm
in my imagination, and so realised to me, that to the hour I saw
them I could not be persuaded but that it was or would be true;
also how I resented it when the Spaniard complained to me,
and how I brought them to justice, tried them before me, and
ordered them all three to be hanged. What there was really in
this, shall be seen in its place; for however I came to form such
things in my dream, and what secret converse of spirits injected
it, yet there was very much of it true.
But to return to my story. In this kind of temper I had
lived some years. I had no enjoyment of my life, no pleasant
hours, no agreeable diversion but what had something or other
of this in it; so that my wife, who saw my mind so wholly bent
upon it, told me very seriously one night that she believed there
was some secret powerful impulse of Providence upon me, which
had determined me to go thither again; and that she found
nothing hindered my going, but my being engaged to a wife and
children. She told me, that it was true she could not think of
parting with me; but as she was assured that if she was dead it
would be the first thing I would do, so, as it seemed to her that
the thing was determined above, she would not be the only
obstruction; for if I thought fit, and resolved to go—here she
found me very intent upon her words, and that I looked very
earnestly at her, so that it a little disordered her, and she
stopped. I asked her why she did not go on, and say out what
she was going to say. But I perceived her heart was too full,
and some tears stood in her eyes. "Speak out, my dear," said
I; "are you willing I should go?" "No," says she very affec-
tionately, " I am far from willing; but if you are resolved to
go," says she, " and rather than I will be the only hindrance, I
will go with you; for though I think it a most preposterous
thing for one of your years, and in your condition, yet if it must
be," said she again, weeping, " I won't leave you; for if it be of
Heaven, you must do it. There is no resisting it; and if Heaven
makes it your duty to go, He will also make it mine to
go with you, or otherwise dispose of me, that I may not
obstruct it."
This affectionate behaviour of my wife's brought me a little
out of the vapours, and I began to consider what I was a-doing.
I corrected my wandering fancy, and began to argue with
myself sedately what business I had, after threescore years,
and after such a life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and
closed in so happy and easy a manner—I say, what business
I had to rush into new hazards, and put myself upon adventures
fit only for youth and poverty to run into.
With those thoughts, I considered my new engagement;
that I had a wife, and two children; that I had all the world
could give me, and had no need to seek hazards for gain; that
I was declining in years, and ought to think rather of leaving
what I had gained, than of seeking to increase it; that as to what
my wife had said, of its being an impulse from Heaven, and
that it should be my duty to go, I had no notion of that; so
after many of these cogitations, I struggled with the power of
my imagination, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe people
may always do in like cases, if they will; and, particularly, as
the most effectual method, I resolved to divert myself with other
things, and to engage in some business that might effectually
tie me up from any more excursions of this kind; for I found
that thing return upon me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing
to do, nor anything of moment immediately before me.
To this purpose I bought a little farm in the county of
Bedford, and resolved to remove myself thither. I had a little
convenient house upon it, and the land about it I found was
capable of great improvement, and that it was many ways
suited to my inclination, which delighted in cultivating,
managing, planting, and improving of land; and particularly
being an inland country, I was removed from conversing
among ships, sailors, and things relating to the remote part of
the world.
In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my family,
bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon, horses, cows,
sheep; and setting seriously to work, became in one half year
a mere country gentleman. My thoughts were entirely taken
up in managing my servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing,
planting, etc.; and I lived, as I thought, the most agreeable
life that nature was capable of directing, or that a man always
bred to misfortunes was capable of being retreated to.
I farmed upon my own land, I had no rent to pay, was
limited by no articles. I could pull up or cut down as I
pleased. What I planted was for myself, and what I improved
was for my family; and having thus left off the thoughts of
wandering, I had not the least discomfort in any part of life,

1 FARMED UPON MY OWN LAND.
as to this world. Now I thought indeed that I enjoyed the
middle state of life that my father so earnestly recommended
to me, and lived a kind of heavenly life, something like what
is described by the poet upon the subject of a country life:
"Free from vices, free from care,
Age has no pain, and youth no snare."
But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from un-
foreseen Providence unhinged me at once; and not only made
a breach upon me, inevitable and incurable, but drove me, by
its consequences, into a deep relapse into the wandering dis-
position; which, as I may say, being born in my very blood,
soon recovered its hold of me, and came on with an irresistible
force upon me, so that nothing could make any more
impression upon me. This blow was the loss of my wife.
She was the stay of all my affairs, the centre of all my
enterprises, the engine that, by her prudence, reduced me to
that happy compass I was in, from the most extravagant and
ruinous project that fluttered in my head, as above, and did
more to guide my rambling genius than a mother's tears, a
father's instructions, a friend's counsel, or my own reasoning
powers could do. I was happy in listening to her tears, and
in being moved by her entreaties, and to the last degree
desolate and dislocated in the world by the loss of her.
When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round me.
I knew neither what to do, or what not to do. My thoughts ran
all away again into the old affair; my head was quite turned
with the whimsies of foreign adventures; and all the pleasant
innocent amusements of my farm and my garden, my cattle
and my family, which before entirely possessed me, were
nothing to me, had no relish, and were like music to one that
has no ear, or food to one that has no taste. In a word, I
resolved to leave off housekeeping, let my farm, and return to
London; and in a few months after I did so.
When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I was
before. I had no relish to the place, no employment in it,
nothing to do but to saunter about like an idle person, of
whom it may be said he is perfectly useless in God's creation,
and it is not one farthing matter to the rest of his kind whether
he be dead or alive. This also was the life which of all cir-
cumstances of life was the most my aversion, who had been
all my days used to an active life; and I would often say to
myself, "A state of idleness is the very dregs of life"; and
indeed I thought I was much more suitably employed when
I was twenty-six days a-making me a deal board.
It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my nephew,
whom, as I had observed before, I had brought up to the sea,
and had made him commander of a ship, was come home from
a short voyage to Bilbao, being the first he had made; and he
came to me, and told me that some merchants of his acquaint-
ance had been proposing to him to go a voyage for them to the
East Indies and to China, as private traders. "And now,
uncle," says he, "if you will go to sea with me, I'll engage to
land you upon your old habitation in the island, for we are to
touch at the Brazils."
Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state, and
of the existence of an invisible world, than the concurrence of
second causes with the ideas of things which we form in our minds,
perfectly reserved, and not communicated to any in the world.
My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wander-
ing was returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had
in his thoughts to say, when that very morning, before he came
to me, I had, in a great deal of confusion of thought, and
revolving every part of my circumstances in my mind, come to
this resolution, viz., that I would go to Lisbon, and consult with
my old sea-captain; and so, if it was rational and practicable,
I would go and see the island again, and see what was become
of my people there. I had pleased myself with the thoughts of
peopling the place, and carrying inhabitants from hence,
getting a patent for the possession, and I know not what; when
in the middle of all this in comes my nephew, as I have said,
with his project of carrying me thither, in his way to the East
Indies.
I paused awhile at his words, and looking steadily at him,
"What devil," said I, " sent you of this unlucky errand?" My
nephew startled, as if he had been frighted at first; but per-
ceiving I was not much displeased with the proposal, he re-
covered himself. "I hope it may not be an unlucky proposal,
sir," says he. "I dare say you would be pleased to see your
new colony there, where you once reigned with more felicity
than most of your brother monarchs in the world."
In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my temper, that
is to say, the prepossession I was under, and of which I have
said so much, that I told him, in few words, if he agreed with
the merchants, I would go with him; but I told him I would
not promise to go any further than my own island. "Why,
sir," says he, " you don't want to be left there again, I hope?"
"Why," said I, " can you not take me up again in your return?"
He told me it could not be possible that the merchants would
allow him to come that way with a loaded ship of such value, it
being a month's sail out of his way, and might be three or four.
"Besides, sir, if I should miscarry," said he, " and not return at
all, then you would be just reduced to the condition you were
in before."
This was very rational; but we both found out a remedy for
it, which was to carry a framed sloop on board the ship, which,
being taken in pieces, and shipped on board the ship, might, by
the help of some carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with us, be

EARNESTLY STRUGGLED WITH ME TO CONSIDER MY YEARS
set up again in the island, and finished, fit to go to sea in a few
days.
I was not long resolving; for indeed the importunities of
my nephew joined in so effectually with my inclination, that
nothing could oppose me. On the other hand, my wife being
dead, I had nobody concerned themselves so much for me as to
persuade me one way or other, except my ancient good friend
the widow, who earnestly struggled with me to consider my
years, my easy circumstances, and the needless hazards of a
long voyage; and above all, my young children. But it was
all to no purpose; I had an irresistible desire to the voyage;
and I told her I thought there was something so uncommon in
the impressions I had upon my mind for the voyage, that it
would be a kind of resisting Providence if I should attempt to
stay at home; after which she ceased her expostulations, and
joined with me, not only in making provision for my voyage,
but also in settling my family affairs for my absence, and pro-
viding for the education of my children.
In order to this I made my will, and settled the estate I had
in such a manner for my children, and placed in such hands,
that I was perfectly easy and satisfied they would have justice
done them, whatever might befall me; and for their education,
I left it wholly to my widow, with a sufficient maintenance to
herself for her care; all which she richly deserved, for no mother
could have taken more care in their education, or understood it
better; and as she lived till I came home, I also lived to thank
her for it.
My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of January
1694-95, and I with my man Friday went on board in the Downs
the 8th, having, besides that sloop which I mentioned above, a
very considerable cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my
colony, which if I did not find in good condition, I resolved to
leave so.
First, I carried with me some servants, whom I purposed to
place there as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there upon
my own account while I stayed, and either to leave them there,
or carry them forward, as they should appear willing; particu-
larly, I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy,
ingenious fellow, who was a cooper by trade, but was also a
general mechanic; for he was dexterous at making wheels, and
handmills to grind corn, was a good turner, and a good pot-
maker. He also made anything that was proper to make of
earth, or of wood; in a word, we called him our Jack-of-all
trades.
With these I carried a tailor, who had offered himself to go
passenger to the East Indies with my nephew, but afterwards
consented to stay on our new plantation, and proved a most
necessary handy fellow as could be desired, in many other
businesses besides that of his trade; for, as I observed formerly,
necessity arms us for all employments.
My cargo, as near as I can collect, for I have not kept an
account of the particulars, consisted of a sufficient quantity of
linen, and some thin English stuffs for clothing the Spaniards,
that I expected to find there, and enough of them as by my
calculation might comfortably supply them for seven years. If
I remember right, the materials I carried for clothing them
with, gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as they
could want for wearing, amounted to above two hundred pounds,
including some beds, bedding, and household stuff, particularly
kitchen utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, etc., and
near an hundred pound more in ironwork, nails, tools of every
kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every necessary thing I could
think of.
I carried also an hundred spare arms, muskets, and fusees,
beside some pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes,
and two pieces of brass cannon; and because I knew not what
time and what extremities I was provided for, I carried an
hundred barrels of powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and the
iron part of some pikes and halberds; so that, in short, we had
a large magazine of all sorts of stores; and I made my nephew
carry two small quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his
ship, to leave behind if there was occasion; that when we
came there we might build a fort, and man it against all sorts
of enemies. And indeed I at first thought there was need
enough for it all, and much more, if we hoped to maintain our
possession of the island, as shall be seen in the course of that
story.
Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and we were
obliged to put in atGalway.in Ireland, where we lay windbound
two and twenty days; but we had this satisfaction with the
disaster, that provisions were here exceeding cheap, and in the
utmost plenty: so that while we lay here we never touched the
ship's stores, but rather added to them; also I took in several
live hogs, and two cows and calves, which I resolved, if I had a
good passage, to put on shore in my island; but we found
occasion to dispose otherwise of them.
We set out the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a
very fair gale of wind for some days. As I remember, it might
be about the 2Oth of February, in the evening late, when the
mate, having the watch, came into the round-house, and told us
he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired; and while he was
telling us of it, a boy came in, and told us the boatswain heard
another. This made us all run out upon the quarter-deck,
where for a while we heard nothing, but in a few minutes we
saw a very great light, and found that there was some very
terrible fire at a distance. In about half-an-hour's sailing, the

A GREAT SHIP ON FIRE.
wind being fair for us, though not much of it, and the weather
clearing up a little, we could plainly discern that it was a great
ship on fire in the middle of the sea.
I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at
all acquainted with the persons engaged in it. I presently re-
collected my former circumstances, and in what condition I was
in when taken up by the Portugal captain; and how much
more deplorable the circumstances of the poor creatures be-
longing to this ship must be if they had no other ship in
company with them. Upon this I immediately ordered that
five guns should be fired, one soon after another, that, if
possible, we might give notice to them that there was help for
them at hand, and that they might endeavour to save themselves
in their boat; for though we could see the flame of the ship, yet
they, it being night, could see nothing of us.
We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning
ship drove, waiting for daylight; when, on a sudden, to our
great terror, though we had reason to expect it, the ship blew
up in the air, and immediately, that is to say, in a few minutes,
all the fire was out, that is to say, the rest of the ship sunk.
This was terrible, and indeed an afflicting sight, for the sake of
R
the poor men, who, I concluded, must be either all destroyed in
the ship, or be in the utmost distress in their boat in the middle
of the ocean, which, at present, by reason it was dark, I could
not see. However, to direct them as well as I could, I caused
lights to be hung out in all the parts of the ship where we could,
and which we had lanthorns for, and kept firing guns all the
night long, letting them know by this that there was a ship not
far off.
About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered the ship's
boats by the help of our perspective glasses, and found there
were two of them, both thronged with people, and deep in the
water. We perceived they rowed, the wind being against them,
that they saw our ship, and did their utmost to make us see
them.
We immediately spread our ancient to let them know we saw
them, and hung a waft out as a signal for them to come on
board, and then made more sail, standing directly to them. In
little more than half-an-hour we came up with them, and in a
word took them all in, being no less than sixty-four men, women,
and children; for there were a great many passengers.
Upon the whole, we found it was a French merchant ship of
three hundred tons, homeward bound from Quebec, in the
river of Canada. The master gave us a long account of the
distress of his ship, how the fire began in the steerage by the
negligence of the steersman; but on his crying out for help
was, as everybody thought, entirely put out, when they found
that some sparks of the first fire had gotten into some part of
the ship so difficult to come at, that they could not effectually
quench it; till getting in between the timbers, and within the
ceiling of the ship, it proceeded into the hold, and mastered
all the skill and all the application they were able to exert.
They had no more to do then but to get into their boats,
which, to their great comfort, were pretty large; being their
longboat, and a great shallop, besides a small skiff, which was
of no great service to them other than to get some fresh water
and provisions into her, after they had secured their lives from
the fire. They had indeed small hope of their lives by getting
into these boats at that distance from any land, only, as they
said well, that they were escaped from the fire, and had a
WE DISCOVERED THE SHIP'S BOATS'
possibility that some ship might happen to be at sea, and might
take them in. They had sails, oars, and a compass, and were
preparing to make the best of their way back to Newfoundland,
the wind blowing pretty fair.
In the midst of their consultations, every one being hopeless
and ready to despair, the captain, with tears in his eyes, told
me they were on a sudden surprised with the joy of hearing a
gun fired, and after that four more; these were the five guns
which I caused to be fired at first seeing the light. This re-
vived their hearts, and gave them the notice which, as above, I
desired it should, viz., that there was a ship at hand for their
help.
It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the
strange ecstasies, the variety of postures which these poor
delivered people ran into to express the joy of their souls at so
unexpected a deliverance. Grief and fear are easily described;
sighs, tears, groans, and a very few motions of the head and
hands make up the sum of its variety; but an excess of joy, a
surprise of joy, has a thousand extravagancies in it. There
were some in tears, some raging and tearing themselves, as if
they had been in the greatest agonies of sorrow; some stark
raving and downright lunatic; some ran about the ship
stamping with their feet, others wringing their hands; some
were dancing, some singing, some laughing, more crying;
many quite dumb, not able to speak a word; others sick and
vomiting, several swooning, and ready to faint; and a few were
crossing themselves and giving God thanks.
I would not wrong them neither. There might be many
that were thankful afterward; but the passion was too strong
for them at first, and they were not able to master it; they were
thrown into ecstasies and a kind of frenzy, and it was but a
very few that were composed and serious in their joy.
Perhaps the case may have some addition to it from the
particular circumstance of that nation they belonged to; I
mean the French, whose temper is allowed to be more volatile,
more passionate, and more sprightly, and their spirits more fluid,
than in other nations. I am not philosopher enough to deter-
mine the cause, but nothing I had ever seen before came up
to it. The ecstasies poor Friday, my trusty savage, was in
when he found his father in the boat came the nearest to it;
and the surprise of the master and his two companions, whom
I delivered from the villains that set them on shore in the
island, came a little way towards it; but nothing was to compare
to this, either that I saw in Friday, or anywhere else in my life.
It is further observable that these extravagancies did not
show themselves in that different manner I have mentioned in
different persons only, but all the variety would appear in a
short succession of moments in one and the same person. A
man that we saw this minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid and
confounded, should the next minute be dancing and hallooing
like an antic; and the next moment be tearing his hair, or
pulling his clothes to pieces, and stamping them under his feet
like a madman; and a few moments after that we should have
him all in tears, then sick, then swooning; and had not
immediate help been had would, in a few moments more, have
been dead. And thus it was, not with one or two, or ten or
twenty, but with the greatest part of them; and, if I remember
right, our surgeon was obliged to let above thirty of them
blood.
There were two priests among them, one an old man, and
the other a young man; and that which was strangest was, that
the oldest man was the worst. The younger priest behaved
with great command of his passions, and was really an example
of a serious, well-governed mind. At his first coming on board
the ship he threw himself flat on his face, prostrating himself in
thankfulness for his deliverance, in which I unhappily and un-
seasonably disturbed him, really thinking he had been in a
swoon; but he soake calmly, thanked me, told me he was giving
God thanks for his deliverance, and begged me to leave him a
few moments, and that next to his Maker he would give me
thanks also.
I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not only left
him, but kept others from interrupting him also. He continued
in that posture about three minutes, or little more, after I left
him, then came to me, as he had said he would, and with a great
deal of seriousness and affection, but with tears in his eyes,
thanked me that had, under God, given him and so many
miserable creatures their lives.
After this the young priest applied himself to his country-
folks; laboured to compose them; persuaded, entreated, argued,
reasoned with them, and did his utmost to keep them within
the exercise of their reason; and with some he had success,
though others were, for a time, out of all government of them-
selves.
I cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may
be useful to those into whose hands it may fall, for the guiding
themselves in all the extravagancies of their passions; for if an
excess of joy can carry men out to such a length beyond the
reach of their reason, what will not the extravagancies of anger,
rage, and a provoked mind carry us to? And, indeed, here I
saw reason for keeping an exceeding watch over our passions
of every kind, as well those of joy and satisfaction, as those of
sorrow and anger.
We were something disordered by these extravagancies among
our new guests for the first day; but when they had been re-
tired, lodgings provided for them as well as our ship would
allow, and they had slept heartily, as most of them did, they
were quite another sort of people the next day.
Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments for the
kindness shown them, was wanting. The French, 'tis known,
are naturally apt to exceed that way. The captain and one
of the priests came to me the next day; and desiring to speak
with me and my nephew, the commander, began to consult with
us what should be done with them; and first they told us, that
as we had saved their lives, so all they had was little enough
for a return to us for that kindness received. The captain said
they had saved some money and some things of value in their
boats, catched hastily up out of the flames; and if we would
accept it, they were ordered to make an offer of it all to us;
they only desired to be set on shore somewhere in our way,
where, if possible, they might get passage to Prance.
My nephew was for accepting their money at first word, and
to consider what to do with them afterwards; but I overruled
him in that part, for I knew what it was to be set on shore in a
strange country; and if the Portugal captain that took me up
at sea had served me so, and took all I had for my deliverance,
I must have starved, or have been as much a slave at the Brazils
as I had been in Barbary, the mere being sold to a Mahometan
excepted; and perhaps a Portuguese is not much a better master
than a Turk, if not, in some cases, a much worse.
I therefore told the French captain that we had taken them
up in their distress, it was true; but that it was our duty to do
so, as we were fellow-creatures, and as we would desire to be so
delivered, if we were in the like or any other extremity; that
we had done nothing for them but what we believed they would
have done for us, if we had been in their case and they in ours;
but that we took them up to save them, not to plunder them;
and therefore I would not let the least thing be taken from
them. As to setting them on shore, I told them indeed that
was an exceeding difficulty to us, for that the ship was bound
to the East Indies; nor could my nephew, the captain,
answer it to the freighters, with whom he was under charter-
party to pursue his voyage by the way of Brazil; and all I
knew we could do for them was, to put ourselves in the way of
meeting with other ships homeward-bound from the West
Indies, and get them passage, if possible, to England or France.
The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind,
they could not but be very thankful for it; but they were in a
very great consternation, especially the passengers, at the
notion of being carried away to the East Indies; and they then
entreated me that, seeing I was driven so far to the westward
before I met with them, I would at least keep on the same
course to the banks of Newfoundland, where it was probable
I might meet with some ship or sloop that they might hire to
carry them back to Canada, from whence they came.
I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part, and
therefore I inclined to agree to it; for indeed I considered that
to carry this whole company to the East Indies would not only
be an intolerable severity upon the poor people, but would be
ruining our whole voyage by devouring all our provisions; so I
thought it no breach of charter-party, but what an unforeseen
accident made absolutely necessary to us, and in which no one
could say we were to blame: for the laws of God and Nature
would have forbid that we should refuse to take up two boats
full of people in such a distressed condition; and the nature of
the thing, as well respecting ourselves as the poor people,
obliged us to set them on shore somewhere or other for their
deliverance. So I consented that we should carry them to
Newfoundland, if wind and weather would permit; and, if not,
that I would carry them to Martinico, in the West Indies.
It was about a week after this that we made the banks of
Newfoundland, where, to shorten my story, we put all our
French people on board a bark, which they hired at sea there,
to put them on shore, and afterwards to carry them to France,
if they could get provisions to victual themselves with. When
I say all the French went on shore, I should remember that the
young priest I spoke of, hearing we were bound to the East
Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, and to be set on shore
on the coast of Coromandel, which I readily agreed to, for I
wonderfully liked the man, and had very good reason, as will
appear afterwards; also four of the seamen entered themselves
on our ship, and proved very useful fellows.
From hence we directed our course to the West Indies,
steering away S. and S. by E. for about twenty days together,
sometimes little or no wind at all, when we met with another
subject for our humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable as
that before.
It was a ship of Bristol bound home from Barbadoes, that
had been blown out of the road at Barbadoes, a few days before
she was ready to sail, by a terrible hurricane, while the captain
and chief mate were both gone on shore; so that besides the
terror of the storm, they were but in an indifferent case for good
artists to bring the ship home. They had been already nine
weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible storm after the
hurricane was over, which had blown them quite out of their
knowledge to the westward, and in which they lost their masts.
But that which was worst of all was, that they were almost
starved for want of provisions, besides the fatigues they had
undergone. Their bread and flesh was quite gone, they had
not one ounce left in the ship, and had had none for eleven days.
The only relief they had was, their water was not all spent, and
they had about half a barrel of flour left; they had sugar enough;
some succades or sweetmeats they had at first, but they were
devoured; and they had seven casks of rum.
There was a youth and his mother and a maid-servant on
board, who were going passengers, and thinking the ship was
ready to sail unhappily came on board the evening before the
hurricane began; and having no provisions of their own left,
they were in a more deplorable condition than the rest; for the
seamen, being reduced to such an extreme necessity themselves,
had no compassion, we may be sure, for the poor passengers;
and they were indeed in a condition that their misery is very
hard to describe.
I had perhaps not known this part if my curiosity had not
led me, the weather being fair, and the wind abated, to go on
board the ship. The second mate, who upon this occasion
commanded the ship, had been on board our ship; and he told
me indeed, they had three passengers in the great cabin, that
were in a deplorable condition. "Nay," says he, " I believe they
are dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above two days;
and I was afraid to inquire after them," said he, "for I had
nothing to relieve them with."
We immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief
we could spare; and indeed I had so far overruled things with
my nephew, that I would have victualled them, though we had
gone away to Virginia, or any part of the coast of America, to
have supplied ourselves; but there was no necessity for that.
But now they were in a new danger, for they were afraid of
eating too much, even of that little we gave them. The mate, or
commander, brought six men with him in his boat, but these poor
wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak, they could
hardly sit to their oars. The mate himself was very ill, and
half-starved, for he declared he had reserved nothing from
the men, and went share and share alike with them in every bit
they ate.
I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat before him
immediately, and he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he
began to be sick, and out of order; so he stopped a while, and
our surgeon mixed him up something with some broth, which
he said would be to him both food and physic; and after he had
taken it, he grew better. In the meantime, I forgot not the
men. I ordered victuals to be given them, and the poor
creatures rather devoured than eat it; they were so exceeding
hungry, that they were in a kind ravenous, and had no command
of themselves; and two of them eat with so much greediness,
that they were in danger of their lives the next morning.
But all the while the mate was thus relating to me the
miserable condition of the ship's company, I could not put out
of my thought the story he had told me of the three poor
creatures in the great cabin, viz., the mother, her son, and the
maid-servant, whom he had heard nothing of for two or three
days, and whom he seemed to confess they had wholly neglected,
their own extremities being so great; by which I understood,
that they had really given them no food at all, and that there-
fore they must be perished, and be all lying dead perhaps on the
floor or deck of the cabin.
As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain,
on board with his men, to refresh them, so I also forgot not the
starving crew that were left on board, but ordered my own boat
to go on board the ship, and with my mate and twelve men to
carry them a sack of bread, and four or five pieces of beef to
boil. Our surgeon charged the men to cause the meat to be
boiled while they stayed, and to keep guard in the cook-room,
to prevent the men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the
pot before it was well boiled, and then to give every man but a
very little at a time; and by this caution he preserved the men,
who would otherwise have killed themselves with that very food
that was given them on purpose to save their lives.
At the same time I ordered the mate to go into the great
cabin, and see what condition the poor passengers were in, and
if they were alive to comfort them, and give them what refresh-
ment was proper; and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher
with some of the prepared broth which he had given the mate
that was on board, and which he did not question would restore
them gradually.
I was not satisfied with this; but, as I said above, having a
great mind to see the scene of misery, which I knew the ship
itself would present me with, in a more lively manner than I
could have it by report, I took the captain of the ship, as we
now called him, with me, and went myself a little after in their
boat.
I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult to get the
victuals out of the boiler before it was ready; but my mate

I FOUND THE POOR MEN ON HOARD ALMOST IN A TUMULT.
observed his order, and kept a good guard at the cook-room
door; and the man he placed there, after using all possible
persuasion to have patience, kept them off by force. However,
he caused some biscuit-cakes to be dipped in the pot, and
softened with the liquor of the meat, which they call brews, and
gave them every one one, to stay their stomachs, and told them
it was for their own safety that he was obliged to give them but
a little at a time.
But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of
another nature, and far beyond the rest; for as first the ship's
company had so little for themselves, it was but too true that
they had at first kept them very low, and at last totally
neglected them; so that for six or seven days, it might be said,
they had really had no food at all, and for several days before
very little. The poor mother, who, as the men reported, was a
woman of good sense and good breeding, had spared all she
could get so affectionately for her son, that at last she entirely
sunk under it; and when the mate of our ship went in, she sat
upon the floor or deck, with her back up against the sides,
between two chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head sunk
in between her shoulders, like a corpse, though not quite dead.
My mate said all he could to revive and encourage her, and
with a spoon put some broth into her mouth. She opened
her lips, and lifted up one hand, but could not speak; yet she
understood what he said, and made signs to him, intimating
that it was too late for her, but pointed to her child, as if she
would have said they should take care of him.
However, the mate, who was exceedingly moved with the
sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth into her mouth;
and, as he said, got two or three spoonfuls down, though I
question whether he could be sure of it or not; but it was too
late, and she died the same night.
The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most
affectionate mother's life, was not so far gone; yet he lay in a
cabin-bed as one stretched out, with hardly any life left in him.
He had a piece of an old glove in his mouth, having eaten up
the restof it. However, being young, and having more strength
than his mother, the mate got something down his throat, and
he began sensibly to revive, though, by giving him some time
after but two or three spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick,
and brought it up again.
But the next care was the poor maid. She lay all along upon
the deck hard by her mistress, and just like one that had fallen
down with an apoplexy, and struggled for life. Her limbs were
distorted, one of her hands was clasped round the frame of a
chair, and she gripped it so hard, that we could not easily make
her let go. Her other arm lay over her head, and her feet lay
both together, set fast against the frame of the cabin-table. In
short, she lay just like one in the last agonies of death; and
yet she was alive too.
The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, and
terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as the men told us
afterwards, was broken-hearted for her mistress, whom she saw
dying for two or three days before, and whom she loved most
tenderly.
We knew not what to do with this poor girl; for when our
surgeon,who was a man of very great knowledge and experience,
had with great application recovered her as to life, he had her
upon his hand as to her senses, for she was little less than
distracted for a considerable time after, as shall appear
presently.
Whoever shall read these memorandums, must be desired to
consider that visits at sea are not like a journey into the
country, where sometimes people stay a week or a fortnight at
a place. Our business was to relieve this distressed ship's crew,
but not to lie by for them; and though they were willing to steer
the same course with us for some days, yet we could carry no
sail to keep pace with a ship that had no masts. However, as
their captain begged of us to help him to set up a main-topmast,
and a kind of a topmast to his jury-foremast, we did, as it were,
lie by him for three or four days; and then having given him
five barrels of beef, and a barrel of pork, two hogsheads of
biscuit, and a proportion of peas, flour, and what other things
we could spare; and taking three casks of sugar, some rum, and
some pieces of eight of them for satisfaction, we left them,
taking on board with us, at their own earnest request, the
priest, the youth, and the maid, and all their goods.
The young lad was about seventeen years of age, a pretty,
well-bred, modest, and sensible youth; greatly dejected with
the loss of his mother, and, as it seems, had lost his father but
a few months before at Barbadoes. He begged of the surgeon
to speak to me to take him out of the ship; for, he said, the
cruel fellows had murdered his mother; and indeed so they
had, that is to say, passively; for they might have spared a
small sustenance to the poor helpless widow, that might have
preserved her life, though it had been but just to keep her alive.
But hunger knows no friend, no relation, no justice, no right,
and therefore is remorseless, and capable of no compassion.
The surgeon told him how far we were going, and how it
would carry him away from all his friends, and put him perhaps
in as bad circumstances, almost, as those we found him in; that
is to say, starving in the world. He said he mattered not
whither he went, if he was but delivered from the terrible crew
he was among; that the captain (by which he meant me, for he
could know nothing of my nephew) had saved his life, and he
was sure would not hurt him ; and as for the maid, he was sure,
if she came to herself, she would be very thankful for it, let us
carry them where we would.
I shall trouble nobody with the little incidents of wind,
weather, currents, &c., on the rest of our voyage; but shorten-
ing my story for the sake of what is to follow, shall observe
that I came to my old habitation, the island, on the lOth of
April 1695. It was with no small difficulty that I found the
place; for as I came to it, and went from it before, on the south
and east side of the island, as coming from the Brazils; so now,
coming in between the main and the island, and having no
chart for the coast, nor any landmark, I did not know it when
I saw it, or know whether I saw it or no.
We beat about a great while, and went on shore on several
islands in the mouth of the great river Oronooque, but none for
my purpose; only this I learned by my coasting the shore, that
I was under one great mistake before, viz., that the continent
which I thought I saw from the island I lived in was really no
continent, but a long island, or rather a ridge of islands, reach-
ing from one to the other side of the extended mouth of the
great river; and that the savages who came to my island were
not properly those which we call Caribbees, but islanders, and
other barbarians of the same kind, who inhabited something
nearer to our side than the rest.
In short, I visited several of these islands to no purpose;
some I found were inhabited, and some were not. But at last
coasting from one island to another, sometimes with the ship,
sometimes with the Frenchman's shallop, which we had found
a convenient boat, and therefore kept her with their very good
will, at length I came fair on the south side of my island, and I
presently knew the very countenance of the place; so I brought
the ship safe to an anchor broadside with the little creek where
was my old habitation.
As soon as I saw the place I called for Friday, and asked
him if he knew where he was? He looked about a little, and
presently clapping his hands cried, "O yes, O there, O yes, O
there !" pointing to our old habitation, and fell a-dancing and
capering like a mad fellow; and I had much ado to keep him
from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore to the place.
"Well, Friday," says I," do you think we shall find anybody
here, or no? And what do you think: shall we see your
father?" The fellow stood mute as a stock a good while; but
when I named his father, the poor affectionate creature looked
dejected, and I could see the tears run down his face very
plentifully. "What is the matter, Friday?" says I; "are you
troubled because you may see your father?" "No, no," says
he, shaking his head, "no see him more, no ever more see
again." "Why so," said I, " Friday? how do you know that?"
—" O no, O no," says Friday, "he long ago die; long ago, he
much old man." "Well, well," said I, "Friday, you don't
know; but shall we see any one else then?" The fellow, it
seems, had better eyes than I, and he points just to the hill
above my old house; and though we lay half a league off, he
cries out, " We see! we see! yes, we see much men there, and
there, and there." I looked, but I could see nobody, no, not
with a perspective glass; which was, I suppose, because I could
not hit the place; for the fellow was right, as I found upon
inquiry the next day, and there was five or six men altogether
stood to look at the ship, not knowing what to think of us.
As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I caused the
English ancient to be spread, and fired three guns, to give them
notice we were friends; and in about half a quarter of an hour
after, we perceived a smoke rise from the side of the creek. So
I immediately ordered a boat out, taking Friday with me; and
hanging out a white flag, or flag of truce, I went directly on
shore, taking with me the young friar I mentioned, to whom I
had told the whole story of my living there, and the manner of
it, and every particular both of myself and those I left there,
and who was on that account extremely desirous to go with
me. We had besides about sixteen men very well armed, if we
had found any new guests there which we did not know of;
but we had no need of weapons.
As we went on shore upon the tide of flood near high-water,
we rode directly into the creek; and the first man I fixed my
eyes upon was the Spaniard whose life I had saved, and whom
I knew by his face perfectly well; as to his habit, I shall
describe it afterwards. I ordered nobody to go on shore at
first but myself; but there was no keeping Friday in the boat;
for the affectionate creature had spied his father at a distance,
a good way off of the Spaniards, where indeed I saw nothing of
him; and if they had not let him go on shore, he would have
jumped into the sea. He was no sooner on shore, but he flew
away to his father like an arrow out of a bow. It would have
made any man have shed tears, in spite of the firmest resolu-
tion, to have seen the first transports of this poor fellow's joy
when he came to his father; how he embraced him, kissed him,
stroked his face, took him up in his arms, set him down upon a
tree, and lay down by him; then stood and looked at him as
any one would look at a strange picture, for a quarter of an
hour together; then He down on the ground, and stroke his
legs, and kiss them, and then get up again, and stare at him;
one would have thought the fellow bewitched; but it would
have made a dog laugh to see how the next day his passion run
out another way. In the morning he walked along the shore,
to and again, with his father, several hours, always leading him
by the hand as if he had been a lady; and every now and then
he would come to fetch something or other for him to the boat,
either a lump of sugar, or a dram, a biscuit-cake, or something
or other that was good. In the afternoon his frolics ran another
way; for then he would set the old man down upon the ground,
and dance about him, and make a thousand antic postures and
gestures; and all the while he did this he would be talking to
him, and telling him one story or another of his travels, and of
what had happened to him abroad, to divert him. In short, if
the same filial affection was to be found in Christians to their
parents in our part of the world, one would be tempted to say
there would hardly have been any need of the fifth com-
mandment.
But this is a digression; I return to my landing. It would
be endless to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities
that the Spaniards received me with. The first Spaniard,
whom, as I said, I knew very well, was he whose life I had
saved. He came towards the boat, attended by one more,
carrying a flag of truce also; and he did not only not know me
at first, but he had no thoughts, no notion, of its being me that
was come till I spoke to him. "Seignior," said I, in Portuguese,
"do you not know me?" At which he spoke not a word; but
giving his musket to the man that was with him, threw his
arms abroad, and saying something in Spanish that I did not
perfectly hear, comes forward, and embraced me, telling me he

'SEIGNIOR, DO You NOT KNOW ME?
was inexcusable not to know that face again that he had once
seen, as of an angel from heaven sent to save his life. He said
abundance of very handsome things, as a well-bred Spaniard
always knows how; and then beckoning to the person that
attended him, bade him go and call out his comrades. He
then asked me if I would walk to my old habitation, where he
would give me possession of my own house again, and where
I should see there had been but mean improvements; so I
walked along with him. But, alas! I could no more find the
place again than if I had never been there ; for they had planted
so many trees, and placed them in such a posture, so thick and
close to one another, and in ten years' time they were grown so
big, that, in short, the place was inaccessible, except by such
windings and blind ways as they themselves only who made
them could find.
I asked them what put them upon all these fortifications?
He told me I would say there was need enough of it when they
had given me an account how they had passed their time since
their arriving in the island, especially after they had the mis-
fortune to find that I was gone. He told me he could not but
have some satisfaction in my good fortune when he heard that I
was gone away in a good ship, and to my satisfaction; and
that he had oftentimes a strong persuasion that one time or
other he should see me again; but nothing that ever befell him
in his life, he said, was so surprising and afflicting to him at
first, as the disappointment he was under when he came back
to the island, and found I was not there.
As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were
left behind, and of whom he said he had a long story to tell me,
the Spaniards all thought themselves much better among the
savages, only that their number was so small. "And," says he,
"had they been strong enough, we had been all long ago in
purgatory "; and with that he crossed himself on the breast.
"But, sir," says he, " I hope you will not be displeased when I
shall tell you how, forced by necessity, we were obliged, for our
own preservation, to disarm them, and make them our subjects,
who would not be content with being moderately our masters,
but would be our murderers." I answered, I was heartily afraid
of it when I left them there; and nothing troubled me at my
parting from the island but that they were not come back, that
I might have put them in possession of everything first, and
left the other in a state of subjection, as they deserved; but if
they had reduced them to it, I was very glad, and should be
very far from finding any fault with it; for I knew they were
a parcel of refractory, ungoverned villains, and were fit for any
manner of mischief.
While I was saying this, came the man whom he had sent
back, and with him eleven men more. In the distress they
were in, it was impossible to guess what nation they were of;
but he made all clear both to them and to me. First he turned
to me, and pointing to them said, " These, sir, are some of the
gentlemen who owe their lives to you "; and then turning to
them, and pointing to me, he let them know who I was; upon
which they all came up one by one, not as if they had been
sailors, and ordinary fellows, and I the like, but really as if they
had been ambassadors of noblemen, and I a monarch or a great
conqueror. Their behaviour was to the last degree obliging
S
and courteous, and yet mixed with a manly, majestic gravity,
which very well became them; and, in short, they had so much
more manners than I, that I scarce knew how to receive their
civilities, much less how to return them in kind.
The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the island
after my going away is so very remarkable, and has so many
incidents which the former part of my relation will help to
understand, and which will, in most of the particulars, refer to
that account I have already given, that I cannot but commit
them with great delight to the reading of those that come
after me.
The first thing which I inquired into, that I might begin
where I left off, was of their own part; and I desired he would
give me a particular account of his voyage back to his country-
men with the boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. He
told me there was little variety in that part; for nothing
remarkable happened to them on the way, they having very
calm weather and a smooth sea; for his countrymen it could
not be doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to see
him. (It seems he was the principal man among them, the
captain of the vessel they had been shipwrecked in having been
dead some time.) They were, he said, the more surprised to
see him, because they knew that he was fallen into the hands
of the savages, who, they were satisfied, would devour him, as
they did all the rest of the prisoners; that when he told them
the story of his deliverance, and in what manner he was
furnished for carrying them away, it was like a dream to them;
but when he showed them the arms, the powder, the ball, and
the provisions that he brought them for their journey or voyage,
they were restored to themselves, took a just share of the joy
of their deliverance, and immediately prepared to come away
with him.
Their first business was to get canoes; and in this they
were obliged not to stick so much upon the honest part of it,
but to trespass upon their friendly savages, and to borrow two
large canoes, or periaguas, on pretence of going out a-fishing,
or for pleasure.
In these they came away the next morning. It seems they
wanted no time to get themselves ready, for they had no
baggage, neither clothes, or provisions, or anything in the
world, but what they had on them, and a few roots to eat, of
which they used to make their bread.
They were in all three weeks absent, and in that time, un-
luckily for them, I had the occasion offered for my escape, as
I mentioned in my other part, and to get off from the island;
leaving three of the most impudent, hardened, ungoverned,
disagreeable villains behind me that any man could desire to
meet with, to the poor Spaniards' great grief and disappoint-
ment, you may be sure.
The only just thing the rogues did was, that when the
Spaniards came on shore they gave my letter to them, and gave
them provisions and other relief, as I had ordered them to do;
also they gave them the long paper of directions, which I had
left with them, containing the particular methods which I took
for managing every part of my life there; the way how I baked
my bread, bred up tame goats, and planted my corn; how I
cured my grapes, made my pots, and, in a word, everything I
did. All this being written down, they gave to the Spaniards,
two of whom understood English well enough; nor did they
refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with everything else, for
they agreed very well for some time. They gave them an
equal admission into the house, or cave, and they began to live
very sociably; and the head Spaniard, who had seen pretty
much of my methods, and Friday's father together, managed
all their affairs; for as for the Englishmen, they did nothing
but ramble about the island, shoot parrots, and catch tortoises,
and when they came home at night, the Spaniards provided
their suppers for them.
The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this, would
the other but have let them alone; which, however, they could
not find in their hearts to do long; but like the dog in the
manger, they would not eat themselves, and would not let
others eat neither. The differences, nevertheless, were at first
but trivial, and such as are not worth relating; but at last
it broke out into open war, and it begun with all the rudeness
and insolence that can be imagined, without reason, without
provocation, contrary to nature, and indeed to common sense;
and though, it is true, the first relation of it came from the
Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the accusers, yet when
I came to examine the fellows, they could not deny a word of it.
But before I come, to the particulars of this part, I must
supply a defect in my former relation; and this was, that I
forgot to set down among the rest, that just as we were weigh-
ing the anchor to set sail, there happened a little quarrel on
board our ship, which I was afraid once would have turned to a
second mutiny; nor was it appeased till the captain, rousing up
his courage, and taking us all to his assistance, parted them by
force, and making two of the most refractory fellows prisoners,
he laid them in irons; and as they had been active in the
former disorders, and let fall some dangerous ugly words the
second time, he threatened to carry them in irons to England,
and have them hanged there for mutiny, and running away with
the ship.
This, it seems, though the captain did not intend to do it,
frighted some other men in the ship; and some of them had
put it into the heads of the rest that the captain only gave
them good words for the present till they should come to some
English port, and that then they should be all put into gaol,
and tried for their lives.
The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us with
it; upon which it was desired that I, who still passed for a
great man among them, should go down with the mate and
satisfy the men, and tell them that they might be assured, if
they behaved well the rest of the voyage, all they had done
for the time past should be pardoned. So I went, and after
passing my honour's word to them they appeared easy, and the
more so when I caused the two men who were in irons to be
released and forgiven.
But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night,
the wind also falling calm. Next morning we found that our
two men who had been laid in irons had stole each of them
a musket and some other weapons; what powder or shot they
had, we know not; and had taken the ship's pinnace, which
was not yet hauled up, and ran away with her to their com-
panions in roguery on shore.
As soon as we found this, I ordered the longboat on shore,
with twelve men and the mate, and away they went to seek the
rogues; but they could neither find them nor any of the rest;
for they all fled into the woods when they saw the boat coming
on shore. The mate was once resolved, in justice to their
roguery, to have destroyed their plantations, burnt all their
household stuff and furniture, and left them to shift without
it; but having no order, he let it all alone, left everything as
they found it, and bringing the pinnace away, came on board
without them.
These two men made their number five; but the other three
villains were so much wickeder than these, that after they had
been two or three days together, they turned their two new-
comers out of doors to shift for themselves, and would have
nothing to do with them; nor could they, for a good while, be
persuaded to give them any food. As for the Spaniards, they
were not yet come.
When the Spaniards came first on shore, the business began
to go forward. The Spaniards would have persuaded the three
English brutes to have taken in their two countrymen again, that,
as they said, they might be all one family; but they would not
hear of it. So the two poor fellows lived by themselves; and
finding nothing but industry and application would make them
live comfortably, they pitched their tents on the north shore of
the island, but a little more on the west, to be out of the danger
of the savages, who always landed on the east parts of the
island.
Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in, and the other
to lay up their magazines and stores in; and the Spaniards
having given them some corn for seed, and especially some of
the peas which I had left them, they dug, and planted, and
enclosed, after the pattern I had set for them all, and began
to live pretty well. Their first crop of corn was on the ground;
and though it was but a little bit of land which they had dug up
at first, having had but a little time, yet it was enough to relieve
them, and find them with bread and such other eatables ; and one
of the fellows being the cook's mate of the ship, was very ready at
making soup, puddings, and other such preparations as the rice
and the milk, and such little flesh as they got, furnished him to do.
They were going on in this little thriving posture, when the
three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in mere
humour, and to insult them, came and bullied them, and told
them the island was theirs; that the governor, meaning me,
had given them possession of it, and nobody else had any right
to it; and damn 'em, they should build no houses upon their
ground, unless they would pay them rent for them.
The two men thought they had jested at first, asked them to
come in and sit down, and see what fine houses they were that
they had built, and tell them what rent they demanded; and
one of them merrily told them if they were ground-landlords,
he hoped if they built tenements upon their land and made
improvements, they would, according to the custom of land-
lords, grant them a long lease; and bid them go fetch a
scrivener to draw the writings. One of the three, damning and
raging, told them they should see they were not in jest; and
going to a little place at a distance, where the honest men had
made a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a firebrand, and
claps it to the outside of their hut, and very fairly set it on
fire; and it would have been all burnt down in a few minutes,
if one of the two had not run to the fellow, thrust him away,
and trod the fire out with his feet, and that not without some
difficulty too.
The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's thrusting
him away, that he returned upon him with a pole he had in his
hand; and had not the man avoided the blow very nimbly, and
run into the hut, he had ended his days at once. His comrade,
seeing the danger they were both in, ran in after him, and im-
mediately they came both out with their muskets; and the
man that was first struck at with the pole knocked the fellow
down that had begun the quarrel with the stock of his musket,
and that before the other two could come to help him; and
then seeing the rest come at them, they stood together, and
presenting the other ends of their pieces to them, bade them
stand off.
The other had firearms with them too; but one of the two
honest men, bolder than his comrade, and made desperate by
his danger, told them if they offered to move hand or foot they
were dead men, and boldly commanded them to lay down their
arms. They did not indeed lay down their arms; but seeing
him so resolute.it brought them to a parley, and they consented

BADE THEM STAND OFF.
to take their wounded man with them, and be gone; and, indeed,
it seems the fellow was wounded sufficiently with the blow.
However, they were much in the wrong, since they had the
advantage, that they did not disarm them effectively, as they
might have done, and have gone immediately to the Spaniards,
and given them an account how the rogues had treated them;
for the three villains studied nothing but revenge, and every day
gave them some intimation that they did so.
But not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser part
of their rogueries, such as treading down their corn, shooting
three young kids and a she-goat, which the poor men had got
to breed up tame for their store, and in a word, plaguing them
night and day in this manner, it forced the two men to such a
desperation, that they resolved to fight them all three the first
time they had a fair opportunity. In order to this they re-
solved to go to the castle, as they called it, that was my old
dwelling, where the three rogues and the Spaniards all lived to-
gether at that time, intending to have a fair battle, and the
Spaniards should stand by to see fair play. So they got up in
the morning before day, and came to the place, and called the
Englishmen by their names, telling a Spaniard that answered
that they wanted to speak with them.
It happened that the day before two of the Spaniards having
been in the woods had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom
for distinction I call the honest men, and he had made a sad
complaint to the Spaniards of the barbarous usage they had
met with from their three countrymen, and how they had ruined
their plantation, and destroyed their corn, that they had
laboured so hard to bring forward, and killed the milch-goat
and their three kids, which was all they had provided for their sus-
tenance; and that if he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards,
did not assist them again, they should be starved. When the
Spaniards came home at night, and they were all at supper, he
took the freedom to reprove the three Englishmen, though in
very gentle and mannerly terms, and asked them how they
could be so cruel, they being harmless, inoffensive fellows, and
that they were only putting themselves in a way to subsist by
their labour, and that it had cost them a great deal of pains to
bring things to such perfection as they had.
One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, What had
they to do there? that they came on shore without leave, and
they should not plant or build upon the island; it was none of
their ground. "Why," says the Spaniard, very calmly, " Seignior
Inglese, they must not starve." The Englishman replied, like
a true rough-hewn tarpaulin, "They might starve and be damned,
they should not plant nor build." "But what must they do
then, seignior?" said the Spaniard. Another of the brutes
returned, " Do! d—n 'em, they should be servants, and work for
them." "But how can you expect that of them?" says the
Spaniard; "they are not bought with your money; you have
no right to make them servants." The Englishman answered,
the island was theirs, the governor had given it to them, and no
man had anything to do there but themselves; and with that
swore by his Maker that they would go and burn all their new
huts, they should build none upon their land.
"Why, seignior," says the Spaniard, "by the same rule, we
must be your servants too." "Ah," says the bold dog, "and so
you shall too, before we have done with you." The Spaniard
only smiled at that, and made him no answer. However, this
little discourse had heated them; and starting up, one says to
the other, I think it was he they called Will Atkins, " Come,
Jack, let us go and have t'other brush with them; we'll demolish
their castle, I'll warrant you; they shall plant no colony in our
dominions."
Upon this they went all trooping away, with every man a
gun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent things
among themselves of what they would do to the Spaniards too
when opportunity offered. But the Spaniards, it seems, did not
so perfectly understand them as to know all the particulars;
only that, in general, they threatened them hard for taking the
two Englishmen's part.
Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time that
evening, the Spaniards said they did not know; but it seems
they wandered about the country part of the night; and then
lying down in the place which I used to call my bower, they
were weary, and overslept themselves. The case was this: they
had resolved to stay till midnight, and so to take the two poor
men when they were asleep; and as they acknowledged after-
wards, intended to set fire to their huts while they were in them,
and either burn them in them, or murder them as they came
out; and as malice seldom sleeps very sound, it was very strange
they should not have been kept waking.
However, as the two men had also a design upon them, as I
have said, though a much fairer one than that of burning and
murdering, it happened, and very luckily for them all, that they
were up and gone abroad, before the bloody-minded rogues
came to their huts.
When they came there and found the men gone, Atkins, who
it seems was the forwardest man, called out to his comrades,
"Ha! Jack, here's the nest, but d—n 'em, the birds are flown."
They mused awhile to think what should be the occasion of
their being gone abroad so soon, and suggested presently that
the Spaniards had given them notice of it; and with that they
shook hands, and swore to one another that they would be
revenged of the Spaniards. As soon as they had made this
bloody bargain, they fell to work with the poor men's habitation.
They did not set fire indeed to anything, but they pulled down
both their little houses, and pulled them so limb from limb, that
they left not the least stick standing, or scarce any sign on the
ground where they stood; they tore all their little collected
household stuff in pieces, and threw everything about in such a
manner, that the poor men afterwards found some of their things
a mile off of their habitation.
When they had done this, they pulled up all the young
trees the poor men had planted; pulled up an enclosure they
had made to secure their cattle and their corn; and in a word,
sacked and plundered everything as completely as a horde of
Tartars would have done.
The two men were at this juncture gone to find them out,
and had resolved to fight them wherever they had been, though
they were but two to three; so that, had they met, there
certainly would have been bloodshed among them; for they
were all very stout, resolute fellows, to give them their due.
But Providence took more care to keep them asunder than
they themselves could do to meet; for as if they had dogged
one another, when the three were gone thither, the two were
here; and afterwards, when the two went back to find them,
the three were come to the old habitation again; we shall see
their differing conduct presently. When the three came back,
like furious creatures, flushed with the rage which the work
they had been about had put them into, they came up to the
Spaniards, and told them what they had done, by way of scoff
and bravado; and one of them stepping up to one of the
Spaniards, as if they had been a couple of boys at play, takes
hold of his hat, as it was upon his head, and giving it a twirl
about, sneering in his face, says he to him, " And you, Seignior
Jack Spaniard, shall have the same sauce if you do not mend
your manners." The Spaniard, who though a quiet, civil man,
was as brave as a man could be desired to be, and withal a
strong, well-made man, looked steadily at him for a good while,
and then, having no weapon in his hand, stepped gravely up to
him, and with one blow of his fist knocked him down, as an ox is
felled with a pole-axe; at which one of the rogues, insolent
as the first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard immediately. He
missed his body indeed, for the bullets went through his hair,
but one of them touched the tip of his ear, and he bled pretty
much. The blood made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt
than he really was, and that put him into some heat, for before
he acted all in a perfect calm; but now resolving to go through
with his work, he stooped to take the fellow's musket whom he
had knocked down, and was just going to shoot the man who
had fired at him, when the rest of the Spaniards, being in the
cave, came out, and calling to him not to shoot, they stepped
in, secured the other two, and took their arms from them.
When they were thus disarmed, and found they had made
all the Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own countrymen,
they began to cool; and giving the Spaniards better words,
would have had their arms again. But the Spaniards, consider-
ing the feud that was between them and the other two English-
men, and that it would be the best method they could take to
keep them from killing one another, told them they would do
them no harm; and if they would live peaceably they would be
very willing to assist and associate with them, as they did
before; but that they could not think of giving them their arms
again while they appeared so resolved to do mischief with them
to their own countrymen, and had even threatened them all to
make them their servants.
The rogues were now no more capable to hear reason than to
act reason; and being refused their arms, they went raving
away, and raging like madmen, threatening what they would
do, though they had no firearms. But the Spaniards, despising
their threatening, told them they should take care how they
offered any injury to their plantation or cattle; for if they did,
they would shoot them as they would do ravenous beasts,
wherever they found them; and if they fell into their hands
alive, they should certainly be hanged. However, this was far
from cooling them; but away they went, raging and swearing
like furies of hell. As soon as they were gone, came back the
two men in passion and rage enough also, though of another
kind; for having been at their plantation, and finding it all
demolished and destroyed, as above, it will easily be supposed
they had provocation enough. Tney could scarce have room
to tell their tale, the Spaniards were so eager to tell them
theirs; and it was strange enough to find three men thus bully
nineteen, and receive no punishment at all.
The Spaniards indeed despised them, and especially having
thus disarmed them made light of all their threatenings; but
the two Englishmen resolved to have their remedy against
them, what pain soever it cost to find them out.
But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told them that as
they had disarmed them, they could not consent that they (the
two) should pursue them with firearms, and perhaps kill them.
"But," said the grave Spaniard, who was their governor, "we
will endeavour to make them do you justice, if you will leave it
to us; for as there is no doubt but they will come to us again
when their passion is over, being not able to subsist without our
assistance, we promise you to make no peace with them with-
out having a full satisfaction for you; upon this condition we
hope you will promise to use no violence with them, other than
in your own defence."
The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and
with great reluctance; but the Spaniards protested they did it
only to keep them from bloodshed, and to make all easy at last.
"For," said they, "we are not so many of us; here is room
enough for us all, and it is great pity we should not be all
good friends." At length they did consent, and waited for the
issue of the thing, living for some days with the Spaniards, for
their own habitation was destroyed.
In about five days' time the three vagrants, tired with
wandering, and almost starved with hunger, having chiefly lived
on turtles' eggs all that while, came back to the grove, and
finding my Spaniard, who, as I have said, was the governor, and
two more with him, walking by the side of the creek, they came
up in a very submissive, humble manner, and begged to be
received again into the family. The Spaniards used them
civilly, but told them they had acted so unnaturally by their
countrymen, and so very grossly by them (the Spaniards), that
they could not come to any conclusion without consulting the
two Englishmen and the rest; but, however, they would go to
them, and discourse about it, and they should know in half-an-
hour. It may be guessed that they were very hard put to it, for
it seems, as they were to wait this half-hour for an answer, they
begged he would send them out some bread in the meantime;
which he did, and sent them at the same time a large piece of
goat's flesh and a broiled parrot, which they eat very heartily,
for they were hungry enough.
After half-an-hour's consultation they were called in, and a
long debate had among them, their two countrymen charging
them with the ruin of all their labour, and a design to murder
them; all which they owned before, and therefore could not
deny now. Upon the whole, the Spaniard acted the moderator
between them; and as they had obliged the two Englishmen
not to hurt the three while they were naked and unarmed, so
they now obliged the three to go and build their fellows' two
huts, one of the same, and the other of larger dimensions than
they were before; to fence their ground again, where they had
pulled up the fences, plant trees in the room of those pulled up,
dig up the land again for planting corn, where they had spoiled
it; and, in a word, to restore everything in the same state they
found it, as near as they could; for entirely it could not be, the
season for the corn, and the growth of the trees and hedges,
not being possible to be recovered.
Well, they submitted to all this, and as they had plenty of
provisions given them all the while, they grew very orderly,
and the whole society began to live pleasantly and agreeably
together; only that these three fellows could never be per-
suaded to work, I mean for themselves, except now and then
a little, just as they pleased. However, the Spaniards told
them plainly that if they would but live sociably and friendly
together, and study in the whole the good of the plantation,
they would be content to work for them, and let them walk about
and be as idle as they pleased; and thus having lived pretty well
together for a month or two, the Spaniards gave them arms
again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with them as before.
It was not above a week after they had these arms, and
went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures began to be insolent
and troublesome as before; but, however, an accident
happening presently upon this, which endangered the safety
of them all, they were obliged to lay by all private resentments,
and look to the preservation of their lives.
It happened one night that the Spaniard governor, as I call
him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose life I had saved, who was
now the captain or leader, or governor of the rest, found him-
self very uneasy in the night, and could by no means get any
sleep. He was perfectly well in body, as he told me the story,
only found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran upon men
fighting, and killing of one another, but was broad awake, and
could not by any means get any sleep. In short, he lay a great
while; but growing more and more uneasy, he resolved to rise.
Being thus gotten up, he looked out; but being dark, he could
see little or nothing; and besides, the trees which I had planted,
as in my former account is described, and which were now grown
tall, intercepted his sight, so that he could only look up, and see
that it was a clear starlight night; and hearing no noise, he re-
turned and laid him down again; but it was all one, he could
not sleep, nor could he compose himself to anything like rest,
but his thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, and yet he
knew not for what.
Having made some noise with rising and walking about,
going out and coming in, another of them waked, and calling,
asked who it was that was up. The governor told him how it had
been with him. "Say you so?" says the other Spaniard; "such
things are not to be slighted, I assure you; there is certainly
some mischief working," says he, "near us;" and presently he
asked him,"Where are the Englishmen?" "They are all in
their huts," says he, "safe enough." It seems the Spaniards
had kept possession of the main apartment, and had made a
place where the three Englishmen, since their last mutiny,
always quartered by themselves, and could not come at the rest.
"Well," says the Spaniard, "there is something in it, I am
persuaded from my own experience. Come," says he, " let us
go out and look abroad; and if we find nothing at all in it to
justify the trouble, I will tell you a story to the purpose, that
shall convince you of the justice of my proposing it."
In a word, they went out to go up to the top of the hill,
where I used to go; but they, being strong, and in good com-
pany, not alone, as I was, used none of my cautions to go up by
the ladder, and then pulling it up after them to go up a second
stage to the top, but were going round through the grove, un-
concerned and unwary, when they were surprised with seeing a
light, as of fire, a very little way off from them, and hearing the
voices of men, not of one or two, but of a great number.
In all the discoveries I had made of the savages landing on
the island, it was my constant care to prevent them making the
least discovery of there being any inhabitant upon the place;
and when by any occasion they came to know it, they felt it so
effectually, that they that got away were scarce able to give
any account of it, for we disappeared as soon as possible, nor
did ever any that had seen me escape to tell any one else,
except it were the three savages in our last encounter, who
jumped into the boat, of whom I mentioned that I was alraid
they should go home and bring more help.
We need not doubt but that the governor and the man with
him, surprised with this sight, ran back immediately, and raised
their fellows, giving them an account of the imminent danger
they were all in, and they again as readily took the alarm; but
it was impossible to persuade them to stay close within where
they were, but that they must run all out to see how things
stood.
While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, and they
had opportunity enough, for some hours, to view them by the
light of three fires they had made at a distance from one
another. What they were doing they knew not, and what to
do themselves they knew not; for, first, the enemy were too
many; and, secondly, they did not keep together, but were
divided into several parties, and were on shore in several places.
The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight;
and as they found that the fellows ran straggling all over the
shore, they made no doubt but, first or last, some of them would
chop in upon their habitation, or upon some other place, where
they would see the token of inhabitants; and they were in
great perplexity also for fear of their flock of goats, which would
have been little less than starving them if they should have been
destroyed; so the first thing they resolved upon, was to despatch
three men away before it was light, viz., two Spaniards and one
Englishman, to drive all the goats away to the great valley
where the cave was, and if need were to drive them in to the
very cave itself.
After having mused a great while on the course they should
take, and beaten their brains in considering their present circum-
stances, they resolved at last, while it was dark, to send the old
savage, Friday's father, out as a spy, to learn if possible some-
thing concerning them, what they came for, and what they
intended to do. The old man readily undertook it, and stripping
himself quite naked, as most of the savages were, away he went.
After he had been gone an hour or two, he brings word that he
had been among them undiscovered, that he found they were
two parties, and of two several nations, who had war with one
another, and had had a great battle in their own country, and
that both sides having had several prisoners taken in the fight,
they were by mere chance landed all in the same island for the
devouring their prisoners, and making merry, but their coming
so by chance to the same place had spoiled all their mirth;
that they were in a great rage at one another, and that they were
so near, that he believed they would fight again as soon as day-
light began to appear; but he did not perceive that they had any
notion of anybody's being on the island but themselves. He
had hardly made an end of telling his story, when they could
perceive, by the unusual noise they made, that the two little
armies were engaged in a bloody fight.
Friday's father used all the arguments he could to persuade
our people to lie close, and not be seen. He told them their
safety consisted in it, and that they had nothing to do but lie
still, and the savages would kill one another to their hands,
and then the rest would go away; and it was so to a tittle.
But it was impossible to prevail, especially upon the English-
men, their curiosity was so importunate upon their prudentials,
that they must run out and see the battle. However, they
used some caution too, viz., they did not go openly just by
their own dwelling, but went farther into the woods, and placed
themselves to advantage, where they might securely see them
manage the fight, and, as they thought, not to be seen by them;
but it seems the savages did see them, as we shall find
hereafter.
The battle was very fierce, and if I might believe the
Englishmen, one of them said he could perceive that some of
them were men of great bravery, of invincible spirit, and of
great policy in guiding the fight. The battle, they said, held
two hours before they could guess which party would be
beaten; but then that party which was nearest our people's
habitation began to appear weakest, and after some time more,
some of them began to fly; and this put our men again into a
great consternation, lest any of those that fled should run into
the grove before their dwelling for shelter, and thereby
involuntarily discover the place, and that by consequence the
pursuers should do the like in search for them. Upon this they
resolved that they would stand armed within the wall, and
whoever came into the grove they should sally out over the
wall and kill them, so that if possible not one should return to
give an account of it. They ordered, also, that it should be
done with their swords, or by knocking them down with the
stock of the musket, but not by shooting them, for fear of
the noise.
As they expected, it fell out. Three of the routed army
fled for life, and crossing the creek ran directly into the place,
not in the least knowing whither they went, but running as into
a thick wood for shelter. The scout they kept to look abroad
gave notice of this within, with this addition, to our men's great
satisfaction, viz., that the conquerors had not pursued them, or
seen which way they were gone. Upon this the Spaniard
governor, a man of humanity, would not suffer them to kill the
three fugitives; but sending three men out by the top of the
hill, ordered them to go round and come in behind them,
surprise, and take them prisoners, which was done. The residue
of the conquered people fled to their canoes, and got off to sea;
the victors retired, and made no pursuit, or very little, but
drawing themselves into a body together gave two great
screaming shouts, which they supposed was by way of triumph,
and so the fight ended; and the same day, about three o'clock
in the afternoon, they also marched to their canoes. And thus
the Spaniards had their island again free to themselves, their
fright was over, and they saw no savages in several years after.
After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of their
den, and viewing the field of battle, they found about two and
thirty dead men upon the spot. Some were killed with great
long arrows, some of which were found sticking in their bodies;
T
but most of them were killed with their great wooden swords,
sixteen or seventeen of which they found in the field of battle,
and as many bows, with a great many arrows. These swords
were strange great unwieldy things, and they must be very
strong men that used them. Most of those men that were
killed with them had their heads mashed to pieces, as we may
say, or, as we call it in English, their brains knocked out, and
several their arms and legs broken; so that 'tis evident they
fight with inexpressible rage and fury. We found not one
wounded man that was not stone dead; for either they stay by
their enemy till they have quite killed him, or they carry all
the wounded men, that are not quite dead, away with them.
This, as I said, tamed even the three English brutes, and for
a great while after they were very tractable, and went about
the common business of their whole society well enough;
planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be all naturalised to the
country. But some time after this they fell all into such
measures as brought them into a great deal of trouble.
They had taken three prisoners, as I had observed; and
these three being lusty stout young fellows, they made them
servants, and taught them to work for them, and as slaves they
did well enough; but they did not take their measures with
them as I did by my man Friday, viz., to begin with them
upon the principle of having saved their lives, and then instruct
them in the rational principles of life, much less of religion,
civilising and reducing them by kind usage and affectionate
arguings; but as they gave them their food every day, so they
gave them their work too, and kept them fully employed in
drudgery enough; but they failed in this by it, that they never
had them to assist them and fight for them as I had my man
Friday, who was as true to me as the very flesh upon my bones.
But to come to the family part. Being all now good friends
—for common danger, as I said above, had effectually recon-
ciled them—they began to consider their general circumstances;
and the first thing that came under their consideration was,
whether, seeing the savages particularly haunted that side of
the island, and that there were more remote and retired parts
of it equally adapted to their way of living, and manifestly to
their advantage, they should not rather remove their habitation,
and plant in some more proper place for their safety, and
especially for the security of their cattle and corn.
Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that they
would not remove their habitation, because that, some time or
other, they thought they might hear from their governor again,
meaning me; and if I should send any one to seek them, I
should be sure to direct them to that side, where, if they should
find the place demolished, they would conclude the savages had
killed us all, and we were gone, and so our supply would
go too.
But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to remove them
into the valley where my cave was, where the land was as
proper for both, and where indeed there was land enough.
However, upon second thoughts they altered one part of that
resolution too, and resolved only to remove part of their cattle
thither, and plant part of their corn there; and so, if one part
was destroyed, the other might be saved. And one part of
prudence they used, which it was very well they did, viz., that
they never trusted those three savages, which they had prisoners,
with knowing anything of the plantation they had made in that
valley, or of any cattle they had there; much less of the cave
there, which they kept in case of necessity as a safe retreat, and
whither they carried also the two barrels of powder which I
had sent them at my coming away.
But, however, they resolved not to change their habitation;
yet they agreed that as I had carefully covered it first with a
wall, or fortification, and then with a grove of trees, so seeing
their safety consisted entirely in their being concealed, of which
they were now fully convinced, they set to work to cover and
conceal the place yet more effectually than before. To this
purpose, as I had planted trees (or rather thrust in stakes which
in time all grew up to be trees) for some good distance before
the entrance into my apartment, they went on in the same
manner, and filled up the rest of that whole space of ground,
from the trees I had set quite down to the side of the creek,
where, as I said, I landed my floats, and even in the very ooze
where the tide flowed, not so much as leaving any place to land,
or any sign that there had been any landing thereabout. These
stakes also being of a wood very forward to grow, as I have
noted formerly, they took care to have generally very much
larger and taller than those which I had planted; and as they
grew apace, so they planted them so very thick and close to-
gether, that when they had been three or four years grown,
there was no piercing with the eye any considerable way into
the plantation. And as for that part which I had planted, the
trees were grown as thick as a man's thigh; and among them
they placed so many other short ones, and so thick, that, in a
word, it stood like a palisado a quarter of a mile thick, and it
was next to imp >ssible to penetrate it but with a little army to
cut it all down; for a little dog could hardly get between the
trees, they stood so close.
But this was not all; for they did the same by all the ground
to the right hand, and to the left, and round even to the top of
the hill, leaving no way, not so much as for themselves to come
out but by the ladder placed up to the side of the hill, and then
lifted up and placed again from the first stage up to the top;
which ladder, when it was taken down, nothing but what had
wings or witchcraft to assist it could come at them.
This was excellently well contrived, nor was it less than
what they afterwards found occasion for; which served to con-
vince me, that as human prudence has the authority of Providence
to justify it, so it has, doubtless, the direction of Providence to
set it to work; and would we listen carefully to the voice of it,
I am fully persuaded we might prevent many of the disasters
which our lives are now, by our own negligence, subjected to.
But this by the way.
I return to the story. They lived two years after this in
perfect retirement, and had no more visits from the savages.
They had indeed an alarm given them one morning, which put
them into a great consternation; for some of the Spaniards
being out early one morning on the west side, or rather the end
of the island, which, by the way, was that end where I never
went, for fear of being discovered, they were surprised with
seeing above twenty canoes of Indians just coming on shore.
They made the best of their way home in hurry enough, and
giving the alarm to their comrades, they kept close all that day
and the next, going out only at night to make observation.
But they had the good luck to be mistaken, for wherever the

ABOUT TWENTY CANOES OF INDIANS JUST COMING ON SHORE.
savages went, they did not land at that time in the island, but
pursued some other design.
And now they had another broil with the three Englishmen,
one of which, a most turbulent fellow, being in a rage at one of
the three slaves, which I had mentioned they had taken, because
the fellow had not done something right which he bid him do,
and seemed a little untractable in his showing him, drew a
hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he wore it by his side, and
fell upon the poor savage, not to correct him, but to kill him.
One of the Spaniards who was by, seeing him give the fellow a
barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at his head, but
struck into his shoulder so that he thought he had cut the poor
creature's arm off, ran to him, and entreating him not to murder
the poor man, clapped in between him and the savage to
prevent the mischief.
The fellow being enraged the more at this, struck at the
Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would serve him as he
intended to serve the savage; which the Spaniard perceiving,
avoided the blow, and with a shovel which he had in his hand
(for they were all working in the field about their corn-land)
knocked the brute down. Another of the Englishmen running
at the same time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard
down; and then two Spaniards more came in to help their
man, and a third Englishman fell in upon them. They had
none of them any firearms, or any other weapon but hatchets
and other tools, except this third Englishman; he had one of
my old rusty cutlasses, with which he made at the two last
Spaniards, and wounded them both. This fray set the whole
family in an uproar, and more help coming in, they took the
three Englishmen prisoners. The next question was, what
should be done with them? They had been so often mutinous,
and were so furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, that they
knew not what course to take with them, for they were mis-
chievous to the highest degree, and valued not what hurt they
did to any man; so that, in short, it was not safe to live with
them.
The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many
words, that if they had been of his own country he would have
hanged them; for all laws and all governors were to preserve
society, and those who were dangerous to the society ought to
be expelled out of it; but as they were Englishmen, and that
it was to the generous kindness of an Englishman that they all
owed their preservation and deliverance, he would use them
with all possible lenity, and would leave them to the judgment
of the other two Englishmen, who were their countrymen.
One of the two honest Englishmen stood up and said, they
desired it might not be left to them, " For," says he, " I am sure
we ought to sentence them to the gallows;" and with that he
gives an account how Will Atkins, one of the three, had pro-
posed to have all the five Englishmen join together, and murder
all the Spaniards when they were in their sleep.
When the Spanish governor heard this he calls to William
Atkins, " How, Seignior Atkins," says he, " would you murder
us all? What have you to say to that?" That hardened
villain was so far from denying it, that he said it was true, and
they would do it still before they had done with them. "Well
but, Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, " what have we done
to you that you would kill us? And what would you get by
killing us? And what must we do to prevent you killing us?
Must we kill you, or you will kill us? Why will you put us to
the necessity of this, Seignior Atkins? " says the Spaniard very
calmly, and smiling.
Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's making
a jest of it, that had he not been held by three men, and withal
had no weapons with him, it was thought he would have
attempted to have killed the Spaniard in the middle of all the
company.
This hare-brained carriage obliged them to consider seriously
what was to be done. The two Englishmen and the Spaniard
who saved the poor savage was of the opinion they should hang
one of the three for an example to the rest; and that, particularly,
it should be he that had twice attempted to commit murder
with his hatchet; and indeed there was some reason to believe
he had done it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable
condition with the wound he had received, that it was thought
he could not live.
But the governor Spaniard still said, No; it was an English-
man that had saved all their lives, and he would never consent
to put an Englishman to death, though he had murdered half
of them; nay, he said, if he had been killed himself by an
Englishman, and had time left to speak, it should be that they
would pardon him.
This was so positively insisted on by the governor Spaniard,
that there was no gainsaying it; and as merciful counsels are
most apt to prevail where they are so earnestly pressed, so they
all came into it; but then it was to be considered what should
be done to keep them from doing the mischief they designed ; for
all agreed, governor and all, that means were to be used for
preserving the society from danger. After a long debate it was
agreed, first, that they should be disarmed, and not permitted
to have either gun, or powder, or shot, or sword, or any weapon,
and should be turned out of the society, and left to live where
they would, and how they would, by themselves; but that none
of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should converse with
them, speak with them, or have anything to do with them ; that
they should be forbid to come within a certain distance of the
place where the rest dwelt; and that if they offered to commit
any disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of the
corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the
society, they should die without mercy, and they would shoot
them wherever they could find them.
The governor, a man of great humanity, musing upon the
sentence, considered a little upon it, and turning to the two
honest Englishmen said, " Hold, you must reflect that it will be
long ere they can raise corn and cattle of their own, and they
must not starve; we must therefore allow them provisions." So
he caused to be added, that they should have a proportion of
corn given to them to last them eight months, and for seed to
sow, by which time they might be supposed to raise some of
their own; that they should have six milch-goats, four he-goats,
and six kids given them, as well for present subsistence as for a
store; and that they should have tools given them for their
work in the fields; such as six hatchets, an axe, a saw, and the
like; but they should have none of these tools or provisions un-
less they would swear solemnly that they would not hurt or
injure any of the Spaniards with them, or of their fellow
Englishmen.
Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out
to shift for themselves. They went away sullen and refractory,
as neither contented to go away or to stay; but as there was no
remedy they went, pretending to go and choose a place where
they would settle themselves, to plant and live by themselves:
and some provisions were given them, but no weapons.
About four or five days after they came again for some
victuals, and gave the governor an account where they had
pitched their tents, and marked themselves out an habitation
and plantation; and it was a very convenient place indeed, on
the remotest part of the island, N.E., much about the place
where I landed in my first voyage when I was driven out to sea,
the Lord knows whither, in my attempt to surround the
island.
Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and con-
trived them in a manner like my first habitation, being close
under the side of a hill, having some trees growing already on
three sides of it; so that by planting others it would be very
easily covered from the sight, unless narrowly searched for.
They desired some dried goat's-skins for beds and covering,
which were given them; and upon giving their words that they
would not disturb the rest, or injure any of their plantations
they gave them hatchets and what other tools they could spare,
some peas, barley, and rice for sowing, and in a word, anything
they wanted but arms and ammunition.
They lived in this separate condition about six months, and
had gotten in their first harvest, though the quantity was but
small, the parcel of land they had planted being but little; for
indeed having all their plantation to form, they had a great deal
of work upon their hands; and when they came to make boards
and pots, and such things, they were quite out of their element
and could make nothing of it; and when the rainy season came
on, for want of a cave in the earth, they could not keep their grain
dry, and it was in great danger of spoiling. And this humbled
them much; so they came and begged the Spaniards to help
them which they very readily did; and in four days worked a
great hole in the side of the hill for them, big enough to secure
their corn and other things from the rain. But it was but a
poor place at best compared to mine, and especially as mine
was then; for the Spaniards had greatly enlarged it and made
several new apartments in it.
About three quarters of a year after this separation a new
frolic took these rogues, which, together with the former villainy
they had committed, brought mischief enough upon them, and
had very near been the ruin of the whole colony. The three
new associates began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious life
they led, and that without hope of bettering their circumstances;
and a whim took them that they would make a voyage to the
continent from whence the savages came, and would try if they
could not seize upon some prisoners among the natives there,
and bring them home, so to make them do the laborious part
of their work for them.
The project was not so preposterous if they had gone no
farther; but they did nothing, and proposed nothing, but had
either mischief in the design, or mischief in the event; and if I
may give my opinion, they seemed to be under a blast from
Heaven.
But I leave observing, and return to the story. The three
fellows came down to the Spaniards one morning, and in very
humble terms desired to be admitted to speak with them. The
Spaniards very readily heard what they had to say, which was
this, that they were tired of living in the manner they did; that
they were not handy enough to make the necessaries they
wanted; and that, having no help, they found they should be
starved; but if the Spaniards would give them leave to take
one of the canoes which they came over in, and give them arms
and ammunition proportioned for their defence, they would go
over to the main, and seek their fortune, and so deliver them
from the trouble of supplying them with any other provisions.
The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them; but yet
very honestly represented to them the certain destruction they
were running into; told them they had suffered such hardships
upon that very spot, that they could, without any spirit of
prophecy, tell them that they would be starved or be murdered,
and bade them consider of it.
The men replied audaciously, they should be starved if they
stayed here, for they could not work, and would not work, and
they could but be starved abroad, and if they were murdered,
there was an end of them, they had no wives or children to
cry after them; and, in short, insisted importunately upon their
demand, declaring that they would go whether they would give
them any arms or no.
The Spaniards told them with great kindness that if they
were resolved to go, they should not go like naked men, and be
in no condition to defend themselves, and that though they
could ill spare their firearms, having not enough for themselves,
yet they would let them have two muskets, a pistol, and a
cutlass, and each man a hatchet, which they thought was suffi-
cient for them.
In a word, they accepted the offer, and having baked them
bread enough to serve them a month, and given them as much
goat's flesh as they could eat while it was sweet, and a great
basketful of dried grapes, a pot full of fresh water, and a young
kid alive to kill, they boldly set out in a canoe for a voyage
over the sea, where it was at least forty miles broad.
The boat was indeed a large one, and would have very well
carried fifteen or twenty men, and therefore was rather too big
for them to manage; but as they had a fair breeze and the flood
tide with them, they did well enough. They had made a mast
'BON V E YA J O'

of a long pole, and a sail of four large goat's-skins dried, which
they had sewed or laced together; and away they went merrily
enough. The Spaniards called after them, Bon veyajo; and no
man ever thought of seeing them any more.
The Spaniards would often say to one other, and to the two
honest Englishmen who remained behind, how quietly and
comfortably they lived now those three turbulent fellows were
gone. As for their ever coming again, that was the remotest
thing from their thoughts that could be imagined; when, behold,
after two and twenty days' absence, one of the Englishmen
being abroad upon his planting work, sees three strange men
coming towards him at a distance, with guns upon their shoulders.
Away runs the Englishman as if he was bewitched, comes
frighted and amazed to the governor Spaniard, and tells him
they were all undone, for there were strangers landed upon
the island, he could not tell who. The Spaniard, pausing a
while, says he to him, " How do you mean, you cannot tell who?
They are the savages, to be sure." "No, no," says the English-
man, "they are men in clothes, with arms." "Nay, then," says
the Spaniard, "why are you concerned? If they are not
savages, they must be friends; for there is no Christian nation
upon earth but will do us good rather than harm."
While they were debating thus, comes the three Englishmen,
and standing without the wood, which was new planted,
hallooed to them. They presently knew their voices, and so
all the wonder of that kind ceased. But now the admiration
was turned upon another question, viz., what could be the
matter, and what made them come back again?
It was not long before they brought the men in; and in-
quiring where they had been, and what they had been doing,
they gave them a full account of their voyage in a few words,
viz., that they reached the land in two days, or something less,
but finding the people alarmed at their coming, and preparing
with bows and arrows to fight them, they durst not go on shore,
but sailed on to the northward six or seven hours, till they came
to a great opening, by which they perceived that the land they
saw from our island was not the main, but an island; that
entering that opening of the sea, they saw another island on the
right hand north, and several more west; and being resolved to
land somewhere, they put over to one of the islands which lay
west, and went boldly on shore; that they found the people
very courteous and friendly to them, and that they gave them
several roots, and some dried fish, and appeared very sociable;
and the women, as well as the men, were very forward to supply
them with anything they could get for them to eat, and brought
it to them a great way upon their heads.
They continued here four days, and inquired, as well as they
could of them by signs, what nations were this way, and that
way; and were told of several fierce and terrible people, that
lived almost every way; who, as they made signs to them, used
to eat men; but as for themselves, they said that they never
ate men or women, except only such as they took in the wars;
and then they owned that they made a great feast, and ate their
prisoners.
The Englishmen inquired when they had a feast of that
kind, and they told him about two moons ago, pointing to the
moon, and then to two fingers; and that their great king had
two hundred prisoners now, which he had taken in his war, and
they were feeding them to make them fat for the next feast. The
Englishmen seemed mighty desirous to see those prisoners,
but the other mistaking them, thought they were desirous to
have some of them to carry away for their own eating. So they
beckoned to them, pointing to the setting of the sun, and then
to the rising; which was to signify, that the next morning at
sun-rising they would bring some for them; and accordingly
the next morning they brought down five women and eleven
men, and gave them to the Englishmen to carry with them on
their voyage, just as we would bring so many cows and oxen
down to a seaport town to victual a ship.
As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home,
their stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know what
to do. To refuse the prisoners would have been the highest
affront to the savage gentry that offered them; and what to do
with them they knew not. However, upon some debates, they
resolved to accept of them; and in return they gave the savages
that brought them one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and
six or seven of their bullets, which though they did not under-
stand, they seemed extremely pleased with; and then tying the
poor creatures' hands behind them, they (the people) dragged
the poor prisoners into the boat for our men.
The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as
they had them, or else they that gave them this noble present
would certainly have expected that they should have gone to
work with them, have killed two or three of them the next
morning, and perhaps have invited the donors to dinner.
But having taken their leave with all the respects and
thanks that could well pass between people where, on either
side, they understood not one word they could say, they put
offwith their boat, and came back towards the first island,
where when they arrived they set eight of their prisoners at
liberty, there being too many of them for their occasion.
In their voyage they endeavoured to have some communi-
cation with their prisoners, but it was impossible to make them
understand anything; nothing they could say to them, or give
them, or do for them, but was looked upon as going about to
murder them. They first of all unbound them, but the poor
creatures screamed at that, especially the women, as if they had
just felt the knife at their throats; for they immediately con-
cluded they were unbound on purpose to be killed.
If they gave them anything to eat, it was the same thing;
then they concluded it was for fear they should sink in flesh,
and so not be fat enough to kill; if they looked at one of them
more particularly, the party presently concluded it was to see
whether he or she was fattest and fittest to kill; nay, after they
had brought them quite over, and began to use them kindly,
and treat them well, still they expected every day to make a
dinner or supper for their new masters.
When the three wanderers had given this unaccountable
history or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard asked them
where their new family was? And being told that they had
brought them on shore, and put them into one of their huts,
and were come up to beg some victuals for them, they, the
Spaniards and the other two Englishmen, that is to say, the
whole colony, resolved to go all down to the place and see
them, and did so, and Friday's father with them.
When they came into the hut, there they sat all bound;
for when they had brought them on shore they bound their
hands, that they might not take the boat and make their
escape. There, I say, they sat, all of them stark naked. First,
there were three men, lusty, comely fellows, well shaped,
straight and fair limbs, about thirty to thirty-five years of age,
and five women, whereof two might be from thirty to forty,
two more not above four or five and twenty, and the fifth, a
tall, comely maiden, about sixteen or seventeen. The women
were well favoured, agreeable persons, both in shape and
features, only tawny; and two of them, had they been perfect
white, would have passed for very handsome women, even in
London itself, having pleasant, agreeable countenances, and of
a very modest behaviour, especially when they came afterwards
to be clothed, and dressed, as they called it, though the dress
was very indifferent, it must be confessed; of which hereafter.
The first thing the Spaniards did was to cause the old
Indian, Friday's father, to go in and see first if he knew any of
them, and then if he understood any of their speech. As soon
as the old man came in, he looked seriously at them, but knew
none of them; neither could any of them understand a word
he said, or a sign he could make, except one of the women.
However, this was enough to answer the end, which was to
satisfy them that the men into whose hands they were fallen
were Christians; that they abhorred eating of men or women,
and that they might be sure they would not be killed. As
soon as they were assured of this, they discovered such joy,
and by such awkward and several ways as is hard to describe,
for it seems they were of several nations.
The woman who was their interpreter was bid in the next
place to ask them if they were willing to be servants, and to
work for the men who had brought them away to save their
lives? At which they all fell a-dancing; and presently one
fell to taking up this, and another that, or anything that lay
next, to carry on their shoulders, to intimate that they were
willing to work.
After some discussion the five Englishmen took them every
one a wife, that is to say, a temporary wife; and so they set up
anew form of living; for the Spaniards and Friday's father
lived in my old habitation, which they had enlarged exceed-
ingly within. The three servants which were taken in the late

DREW LOTS AMONG THIM.
battle of the savages, lived with them; and these carried on the
main part of the colony, supplying all the rest with food, and
assisting them in anything as they could, or as they found
necessity required.
But the wonder of this story was, how five such refractory,
ill-matched fellows should agree about these women, and that
two of them should not pitch upon the same woman, especially
seeing two or three of them were, without comparison, more
agreeable than the other: but they took a good way enough
to prevent quarreling among themselves; for they set the five
women by themselves in one of their huts, and they went all
into the other hut, and drew lots among them who should
choose first.
He that drew to choose first went away by himself to the
hut where the poor naked creatures were, and fetched out her
he chose; and it was worth observing, that he that chose first
took her that was reckoned the homeliest and the oldest of the
five, which made mirth enough among the rest; and even the
Spaniards laughed at it. But the fellow considered better than
any of them, that it was application and business that they
were to expect assistance in as much as anything else; and she
proved the best wife of all the parcel.
When the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus,
and fetched out one by one, the terrors of their condition re-
turned upon them again, and they firmly believed that they
were now a-going to be devoured. Accordingly, when the
English sailor came in and fetched out one of them, the rest set
up a most lamentable cry, and hung about her, and took their
leave of her with such agonies and such affection as would have
grieved the hardest heart in the world; nor was it possible for
the Englishmen to satisfy them that they were not to be
immediately murdered, till they fetched the old man, Friday's
father, who immediately let them know that the five men who
had fetched them out one by one had chosen them for their wives.
When they had done, and the fright the women were in was
a little over, the men went to work, and the Spaniards came
and helped them; and in a few hours they had built them
everyone a new hut or tent for their lodging apart; for those
they had already were crowded with their tools, household stuff,
and provision. The three wicked ones had pitched farthest off,
and the two honest ones nearer, but both on the north shore of
the island, so that they continued separate as before; and thus
my island was peopled in three places, and, as I might say,
three towns were begun to be planted.
And here 'tis very well worth observing, that as it often
happens in the world (what the wise ends of God's providence
are in such a disposition of things I cannot say), the two honest
fellows had the two worst wives; and the three reprobates, that
were scarce worth hanging, that were fit for nothing, and
neither seemed born to do themselves good, or any one else,
had three clever, diligent, careful, and ingenious wives; not
that the two first were ill wives as to their temper or humour,
for all the five were most willing, quiet, passive, and subjected
creatures, rather like slaves than wives; but my meaning is,
they were not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, or alike
cleanly and neat.
Another observation I must make, to the honour of a
diligent application on one hand, and to the disgrace of a
slothful, negligent, idle temper on the other, that when I came
to the place and viewed the several improvements, plantings,
and management of the several little colonies, the two men had
so far outgone the three, that there was no comparison. They
had indeed both of them as much ground laid out for corn as
they wanted; and the reason was, because, according to my
rule, Nature dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more
corn than they wanted; but the difference of the cultivation,
of the planting, of the fences, and indeed of everything else,
was easy to be seen at first view.
It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and cleanly
within doors; and having learned the English ways of dressing
and cooking from one of the other Englishmen, who, as I said,
was cook's mate on board the ship, they dressed their husbands'
victuals very nicely and well; whereas the other could not be
brought to understand it; but then the husband, who, as I say,
had been cook's mate, did it himself. But as for the husbands
of the three wives, they loitered about, fetched turtles' eggs, and
caught fish and birds; in a word, anything but labour, and they
fared accordingly. The diligent lived well and comfortably,
and the slothful lived hard and beggarly; and so I believe,
generally speaking, it is all over the world.
But now I come to a scene different from all that had
happened before, either to them or to me; and the original
of the story was this.
Early one morning there came on shore five or six canoes
of Indians, or savages, call them which you please; and there is
no room to doubt that they came upon the old errand of feed-
ing upon their slaves. But that part was now so familiar to the
Spaniards, and to our men too, that they did not concern them-
selves about it, as I did; but having been made sensible by
their experience that their only business was to lie concealed,
and that, if they were not seen by any of the savages, they
would go off again quietly when their business was done, having
as yet not the least notion of there being any inhabitants in the
island; I say, having been made sensible of this, they had
nothing to do but to give notice to all the three plantations to
U
keep within doors, and not show themselves, only placing a scout
in a proper place to give notice when the boats went to sea again.
This was, without doubt, very right; but a disaster spoiled
all these measures, and made it known among the savages that
there were inhabitants there, which was, in the end, the desola-
tion of almost the whole colony. After the canoes with the
savages were gone off, the Spaniards peeped abroad again, and
some of them had the curiosity to go to the place where they
had been, to see what they had been doing. Here, to their
great surprise, they found three savages left behind, and lying
fast asleep upon the ground. It was supposed they had either
been so gorged with their inhuman feast that, like beasts, they
were asleep, and would not stir when the others went, or they
were wandered into the woods, and did not come back in time
to be taken in.
The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and
perfectly at a loss what to do. The Spaniard governor, as it
happened, was with them, and his advice was asked; but he
professed he knew not what to do. As for slaves, they had
enough already; and as to killing them, they were none of them
inclined to that. The Spaniard governor told me they could
not think of shedding innocent blood; for as to them, the poor
creatures had done them no wrong, invaded none of their
property, and they thought they had no just quarrel against
them to take away their lives. After some consultation they
resolved upon this, that they would lie still a while longer, till,
if possible, these three men might be gone; but then the
governor Spaniard recollected that the three savages had no
boat, and that if they were left to rove about the island, they
would certainly discover that there were inhabitants in it, and
so they should be undone that way.
Upon this they went back again, and there lay the fellows
fast asleep still; so they resolved to waken them, and take them
prisoners, and they did so. The poor fellows were strangely
frighted when they were seized upon and bound, and afraid, like
the women, that they should be murdered and eaten; for it
seems those people think all the world does as they do, eating
men's flesh; but they were soon made easy as to that, and away
they carried them.
It was very happy to them that they did not carry them
home to their castle; I mean, to my palace under the hill; but
they carried them first to the bower, where was the chief of their
country work, such as the keeping the goats, the planting the
corn, &c.; and afterwards they carried them to the habitation
of the two Englishmen.
Here they were set to work, though it was not much they
had for them to do; and whether it was by negligence in
guarding them, or that they thought the fellows could not
mend themselves, I know not, but one of them ran away, and
taking into the woods, they could never hear of him more.
They had good reason to believe he got home again soon
after, in some other boats or canoes of savages, who came on
shore three or four weeks afterwards, and who, carrying on their
revels as usual, went off again in two days' time. This thought
terrified them exceedingly; for they concluded, and that not
without good cause indeed, that if this fellow came safe home
among his comrades, he would certainly give them an account
that there were people in the island, as also how few and weak
they were; for this savage, as I observed before, had never
been told, and it was very happy he had not, how many there
were, or where they lived, nor had he ever seen or heard the fire
of any of their guns, much less had they shown him any of their
other retired places, such as the cave in the valley, or the new
retreat which the two Englishmen had made, and the like.
The first testimony they had that this fellow had given
intelligence of them was, that about two months after this six
canoes of savages, with about seven or eight or ten men in a
canoe, came rowing along the north side of the island, where
they never used to come before, and landed about an hour after
sunrise at a convenient place, about a mile from the habitation
of the two Englishmen, where this escaped man had been kept.
As the Spaniard governor said, had they been all there the
damage would not have been so much, for not a man of them
would have escaped; but the case differed now very much, for
two men to fifty was too much odds. The two men had the
happiness to discover them about a league off, so that it was
above an hour before they landed, and as they landed a mile
from their huts, it was some time before they could come at
them. Now having great reason to believe that they were
betrayed, the first thing they did was to bind the two slaves
which were left, and cause two of the three men whom they
brought with the women, who, it seems, proved very faithful to
them, to lead them with their two wives, and whatever they
could carry away with them, to their retired place in the woods,
which I have spoken of above, and there to bind the two
fellows hand and foot till they heard further.
In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on
shore, and that they bent their course directly that way, they
opened the fences where their milch-goats were kept, and drove
them all out, leaving their goats to straggle into the woods
whither they pleased, that the savages might think they were
all bred wild; but the rogue who came with them was too
cunning for that, and gave them an account of it all, for they
went directly to the place.
When the two poor frighted men had secured their wives
and goods, they sent the other slave they had of the three who
came with the women, and who was at their place by accident,
away to the Spaniards with all speed, to give them the alarm,
and desire speedy help; and in the meantime they took their
arms, and what ammunition they had, and retreated towards
the place in the wood where their wives were sent, keeping at a
distance, yet so that they might see, if possible, which way the
savages took.
They had not gone far but that, from a rising ground, they
could see the little army of their enemies come on directly to
their habitation, and in a moment more could see all their huts
and household stuff flaming up together, to their great grief and
mortification; for they had a very great loss, to them irretriev-
able, at least for some time. They kept their station for a
while till they found the savages, like wild beasts, spread them-
selves all over the place, rummaging every way, and every place
they could think of, in search for prey, and in particular for the
people, of whom it now plainly appeared they had intelligence.
The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves not
secure where they stood, because as it was likely some of the
wild people might come that way, so they might come too many
together, thought it proper to make another retreat about half

a mile farther, believing, as it afterwards happened, that the
farther they strolled the fewer would be together.
The next halt was at the entrance into a very thick grown
part of the woods, and where an old trunk of a tree stood,
which was hollow, and vastly large; and in this tree they both
took their standing, resolving to see there what might offer.
They had not stood there long, but two of the savages
appeared running directly that way, as if they had already had
notice where they stood, and were coming up to attack them;
and a little way farther they spied three more coming after them,
and five more beyond them, all coming the same way, besides
which they saw seven or eight more at a distance running
another way; for in a word, they ran every way, like sportsmen
beating for their game.
The poor men were now in great perplexity whether they
should stand and keep their posture, or fly; but after a very
short debate with themselves, they considered, that if the savages
ranged the country thus before help came, they might, perhaps,
find out their retreat in the woods, then all would be lost; so
they resolved to stand them there; and if they were too many
to deal with, then they would get up to the top of the tree, from
whence they doubted not to defend themselves, fire excepted,
as long as their ammunition lasted, though all the savages that
were landed, which was near fifty, were to attack them.
Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether
they should fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so
take the middle party, by which the two and the five that followed
would be separated; and they resolved to let the two first pass by,
unless they should spy them in the tree, and come to attack them.
The two first savages also confirmed them in this regulation,
by turning a little from them towards another part of the wood;
but the three, and the five after them, came forwards directly
to the tree, as if they had known the Englishmen were there.
Seeing them come so straight towards them, they resolved
to take them in a line as they came; and as they resolved to
fire but one at a time, perhaps the first shot might hit them all
three; to which purpose the man who was to fire put three or
four small bullets into his piece, and having a fair loophole, as
it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim,
without being seen, waiting till they were within about thirty
yards of the tree, so that he could not miss.
While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on,
they plainly saw that one of the three was the runaway savage
that had escaped from them, and they both knew him distinctly,
and resolved that, if possible, he should not escape, though they
should both fire; so the other stood ready with his piece, that
if he did not drop at the first shot, he should be sure to have a
second.
But the first was too good a marksman to miss his aim;
for as the savages kept near one another, a little behind in a
line, in a word, he fired, and hit two of them directly. The
foremost was killed outright, being shot in the head; the second,
which was the runaway Indian, was shot through the body, and
fell, but was not quite dead; and the third had a little scratch
in the shoulder, perhaps by the same ball that went through
the body of the second; and being dreadfully frighted, though
not much hurt, sat down upon the ground, screaming and yell-
ing in a hideous manner.
The five that were behind, more frighted with the noise than
sensible of the danger, stood still at first; for the woods made
the sound a thousand times bigger than it really was, the echoes
rattling from one side to another, and the fowls rising from all
parts, screaming and making, every sort, a several kind of noise,
according to their kind ; just as it was when I fired the first
gun that, perhaps, was ever shot off in that place since it was
an island.
However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what
the matter was, came on unconcerned, till they came to the
place where their companions lay in a condition miserable
enough; and here the poor ignorant creatures, not sensible that
they were within reach of the same mischief, stood all of a
huddle over the wounded man, talking, and, as may be supposed,
inquiring of him how he came to be hurt; and who, 'tis very
rational to believe, told them that a flash of fire first, and im-
mediately after that thunder from their gods, had killed two,
and wounded him. This, I say, is rational; for nothing is more
certain than that, as they saw no man near them, so they had
never heard a gun in all their lives, or so much as heard of a
gun; neither knew they anything of killing or wounding at a
distance with fire or bullets. If they had, one might reason-
ably believe they would not have stood so unconcerned in view-
ing the fate of their fellows without some apprehension of their
own.
Our two men, though, as they confessed to me, it grieved
them to be obliged to kill so many poor creatures, who at the
same time had no notion of their danger; yet having them all
thus in their power, and the first having loaded his piece again,
resolved to let fly both together among them, and singling out,
by agreement, which to aim at, they shot together, and killed,
or very much wounded, four of them; the fifth, frighted even
to death, though not hurt, fell with the rest; so that our men,
seeing them all fall together, thought they had killed them all.
The belief that the savages were all killed made our two
men come boldly out from the tree before they had charged
their guns again, which was a wrong step, and they were under
some surprise when they came to the place and found no less
than four of the men alive, and of them two very little hurt, and
one not at all. This obliged them to fall upon them with the
stocks of their muskets; and first they made sure of the run-
away savage, that had been the cause of all the mischief, and
of another that was hurt in his knee, and put them out of their
pain. Then the man that was not hurt at all came and kneeled
down to them with his two hands held up, and made piteous
moans to them by gestures and signs for his life, but could not
say one word to them that they could understand.
However, they signed to him to sit down at the foot of a
tree thereby; and one of the Englishmen, with a piece of rope-
twine which he had by great chance in his pocket, tied his
two feet fast together, and his two hands behind him, and there
they left him, and with what speed they could made after the
other two which were gone before, fearing they, or any more of
them, should find the way to their covered place in the woods,
where their wives, and the few goods they had left, lay. They
came once in sight of the two men, but it was at a great distance.
However, they had the satisfaction to see them cross over a
valley towards the sea, the quite contrary way from that which
led to their retreat, which they were afraid of; and being satis-
fied with that, they went back to the tree where they left their
prisoner, who, as they supposed, was delivered by his comrades;
for he was gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn with which
they bound him lay just at the foot of the tree.
They were now in as great concern as before, not knowing
what course to take, or how near the enemy might be, or in what
numbers; so they resolved to go away to the place where their
wives were, to see if all was well there, and to make them easy,
who were in fright enough to be sure; for though the savages
were their own country-folk, yet they were most terribly afraid
of them, and perhaps the more for the knowledge they had of
them.
When they came there, they found the savages had been in
the wood, and very near that place, but had not found it; for it
was indeed inaccessible, by the trees standing so thick, as before,
had not the persons seeking it been directed by those that knew
it, which these did not. They found, therefore, everything very
safe, only the women in a terrible fright. While they were
here they had the comfort to have seven of the Spaniards come
to their assistance; the other ten, with their servants and old
Friday, I mean Friday's father, were gone in a body to defend
their bower, and the corn and cattle that was kept there, in
case the savages should have roved over to that side of the
country; but they did not spread so far. With the seven
Spaniards came one of the three savages, who, as I said, were
their prisoners formerly, and with them also came the savage
whom the Englishmen had left bound hand and foot at the tree;
for it seems they came that way, saw the slaughter of the seven
men, and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with
them, where, however, they were obliged to bind him again, as
they had the two others, who were left when the third ran away.
The prisoners began now to be a burden to them, and they
were so afraid of their escaping, that they were once resolving
to kill them all, believing they were under an absolute necessity
to do so for their own preservation. However, the Spaniard
governor would not consent to it, but ordered for the present
that they should be sent out of the way to my old cave in the
valley, and be kept there, with two Spaniards to guard them
and give them food for their subsistence, which was done; and
they were bound there hand and foot for that night.
When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so
encouraged, that they could not satisfy themselves to stay any
longer there. They resolved, though with all possible caution,
to go forward towards their ruined plantation ; but a little before
they came thither, coming in sight of the sea-shore, they saw
plainly the savages all embarking again in their canoes, in order
to be gone.
They seemed sorry at first, and there was no way to come
at them to give them a parting blow; but upon the whole were
very well satisfied to be rid of them.
The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all their
improvement destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help
them to rebuild, and to assist them with needful supplies.
Their three countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the
least inclination to any good, yet as soon as they heard of it
(for they, living remote eastward, knew nothing of the^matter
till all was over), came and offered their help and assistance,
and did very friendly work for several days to restore their
habitation, and make necessaries for them; and thus in a little
time they were set upon their legs again.
About two days after this they had the further satisfaction
of seeing three of the savages' canoes come driving on shore,
and at some distance from them, two drowned men; by which
they had reason to believe that they had met with a storm at
sea, and had overset some of them, for it had blown very hard
the very night after they went off.
However, as some might miscarry, so on the other hand
enough of them escaped to inform the rest, as well of what they
had done, as of what had happened to them, and to whet them
on to another enterprise of the same nature, which they, it
seems, resolved to attempt, with sufficient force to carry all
before them; for except what the first man had told them of
inhabitants, they could say little to it of their own knowledge,
for they never saw one man; and the fellow being killed that
had affirmed it, they had no other witness to confirm it to them.
It was five or six months after this before they heard any
more of the savages, in which time our men were in hopes they
had either forgot their former bad luck, or given over the hopes
of better, when on a sudden they were invaded with the most
formidable fleet of no less than eight and twenty canoes, full of
savages, armed with bows and arrows, great clubs, wooden
swords, and such like engines of war; and they brought such
numbers with them, that, in short, it put all our people into the
utmost consternation.
As they came on shore in the evening, and at the eastermost
side of the island, our men had that night to consult and
consider what to do; and in the first place, knowing that
their being entirely concealed was their only safety before, and
would much more be so now while the number of their enemies
was so great, they therefore resolved, first of all, to take down
the huts which were built for the two Englishmen, and drive
away their goats to the old cave; because they supposed the
savages would go directly thither as soon as it was day
to play the old game over again, though they did not now land
within two leagues of it.
In the next place, they drove away all the flock of goats
they had at the old bower, as I called it, which belonged to the
Spaniards, and, in short, left as little appearance of inhabitants
anywhere as was possible; and the next morning early they
posted themselves with all their force at the plantation of the
two men, waiting for their coming. As they guessed, so it
happened. These new invaders, leaving their canoes at the
east end of the island, came ranging along the shore, directly
towards the place, to the number of 250, as near as our men
could judge. Our army was but small indeed; but that which
was worse, they had not arms for all their number neither. The
whole account, it seems, stood thus. First, as to the men :—
17 Spaniards.
5 Englishmen.
1 Old Friday, or Friday's father.
3 The three slaves taken with the women, who proved
very faithful.
3 Other slaves who lived with the Spaniards.
To arm these they had :—
11 Muskets.
5 Pistols.
3 Fowling-pieces.
5 Muskets, or fowling-pieces, which were taken by me
from the mutinous seamen whom I reduced.
2 Swords.
3 Old halberds.
To their slaves they did not give either musket or fusee, but
they had every one a halberd, or a long staff, like a quarter-
staff, with a great spike of iron fastened into each end of it,
and by his side a hatchet; also every one of our men had
hatchets. Two of the women could not be prevailed upon but
they would come into the fight, and they had bows and arrows,
which the Spaniards had taken from the savages when the first
action happened, which I have spoken of, where the Indians
fought with one another; and the women had hatchets too.
The Spaniard governor, whom I have described so often,
commanded the whole; and William Atkins, who, though a
dreadful fellow for wickedness, was a most daring, bold fellow,
commanded under him. The savages came forward like lions,
and our men, which was the worst of their fate, had no ad-
vantage in their situation; only that Will Atkins, who now
proved a most useful fellow, with six men, was planted just
behind a small thicket of bushes, as an advanced guard, with
orders to let the first of them pass by, and then fire into the
middle of them, and as soon as he had fired to make his retreat,
as nimbly as he could, round a part of the wood, and so come
in behind the Spaniards where they stood, having a thicket of
trees also before them.
When the savages came on, they ran straggling about every
way in heaps, out of all manner of order, and William Atkins
let about fifty of them pass by him; then seeing the rest come
in a very thick throng, he orders three of his men to fire, having
loaded their muskets with six or seven bullets apiece, about as
big as large pistol-bullets. How many they killed or wounded
they knew not; but the consternation and surprise was in-
expressible among the savages. They were frighted to the last
degree to hear such a dreadful noise, and see their men killed,
and others hurt, but see nobody that did it. When in the
middle of their fright William Atkins and his other three let fly
again among the thickest of them, and in less than a minute
the first three, being loaded again, gave them a third volley.
Had William Atkins and his men retired immediately as
soon as they had fired, as they were ordered to do, or had the
rest of the body been at hand to have poured in their shot con-
tinually, the savages had been effectually routed ; for the terror
that was among them came principally from this, viz., that they
were killed by the gods with thunder and lightning, and could
see nobody that hurt them. But William Atkins, staying to
load again, discovered the cheat. Some of the savages, who
were at a distance, spying them, came upon them behind; and
though Atkins and his men fired at them also, two or three
times, and killed above twenty, retiring as fast as they could,
yet they wounded Atkins himself, and killed one of his fellow
Englishmen with their arrows, as they did afterwards one
Spaniard and one of the Indian slaves who came with the
women. This slave was a most gallant fellow, and fought most
desperately, killing five of them with his own hand, having no
weapon but one of the armed staves and a hatchet.
Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded and two
other men killed, retreated to a rising ground in the wood; and
the Spaniards, after firing three volleys upon them, retreated
also; for their number was so great, and they were so desperate,
that though above fifty of them were killed, and more than so
many wounded, yet they came on in the teeth of our men,
fearless of danger, and shot their arrows like a cloud; and it
was observed that their wounded men, who were not quite dis-
abled, were made outrageous by their wounds, and fought like
madmen.
When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the
Englishman that was killed behind them; and the savages,
when they came up to them, killed them over again in a
wretched manner, breaking their arms, legs, and heads with
their clubs and wooden swords, like true savages. But finding
our men were gone, they did not seem to pursue them, but
drew themselves up in a kind of a ring, which is, it seems, their
custom, and shouted twice in token of their victory; after
which, they had the mortification to see several of their
wounded men fall, dying with the mere loss of blood.
The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up to-
gether upon a rising ground, Atkins, though he was wounded,
would have had him marched and charged them again alto-
gether at once. But the Spaniard replied, "Seignior Atkins,
you see how their wounded men fight; let them alone till
morning; all these wounded men will be stiff and sore with
their wounds, and faint with the loss of blood, and so we shall
have the fewer to engage."
The advice was good; but Will Atkins replied merrily,
"That's true, Seignior, and so shall I too; and that's the reason
I would go on while I am warm." "Well, Seignior Atkins,"
says the Spaniard, "you have behaved gallantly, and done your
part; we will fight for you if you cannot come on, but I think
it best to stay till morning." So they waited.
But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they found the
savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded men,
and a great hurry and noise among them where they lay, they
afterwards resolved to fall upon them in the night, especially if
they could come to give them but one volley before they were
discovered, which they had a fair opportunity to do; for one of
the two Englishmen, in whose quarter it was where the fight
began, led them round between the woods and seaside west-
ward, and then turning short south they came so near where
the thickest of them lay, that before they were seen or heard
eight of them fired in among them, and did dreadful execution
upon them. In half a minute more eight others fired after
them, pouring in their small shot in such a quantity, that
abundance were killed and wounded; and all this while they
were not able to see who hurt them, or which way to fly.
The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition,
and then divided themselves into three bodies, and resolved to
fall in among them altogether. They had in each body eight
persons; that is to say, twenty-four, whereof were twenty-two
men and the two women, who, by the way, fought desperately.
They divided the firearms equally in each party, and so of
the halberds and staves. They would have had the women
keep back, but they said they were resolved to die with their
husbands. Having thus formed their little army, they marched
out from among the trees, and came up to the teeth of the
enemy, shouting and hallooing as loud as they could. The
savages stood all together, but were in the utmost confusion,
hearing the noise of our men shouting from three quarters to-
gether; they would have fought if they had seen us; and as
soon as we came near enough to be seen, some arrows were
shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, though not danger-
ously. But our men gave them no time, but running up to
them fired among them three ways, and then fell in with the
butt ends of their muskets, their swords, armed staves, and
hatchets; and laid about them so well, that, in a word, they set
up a dismal screaming and howling, flying to save their lives
which way soever they could.
Our men were tired with the execution; and killed, or
mortally wounded, in the two fights, about one hundred and
eighty of them. The rest, being frighted out of their wits,
scoured through the woods and over the hills, with all the speed
and fear that nimble feet could help them to do; and as we did
not trouble ourselves much to pursue them, they got all together
to the seaside, where they landed, and where their canoes lay.
But their disaster was not at an end yet, for it blew a terrible
storm of wind that evening from the seaward, so that it was
impossible for them to go off; nay, the storm continuing all
night, when the tide came up their canoes were most of them
driven by the surge of the sea so high upon the shore, that it
required infinite toil to get them off; and some of them were
even dashed to pieces against the beach, or against one
another.
Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little rest
that night; but having refreshed themselves as well as they
could, they resolved to march to that part of the island where
the savages were fled, and see what posture they were in. This
necessarily led them over the place where the fight had been,
and where they found several of the poor creatures not quite
dead, and yet past recovering life; a sight disagreeable enough
to generous minds; for a truly great man, though obliged by
the law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes no delight in his
misery. However, there was no need to give any orders in this
case; for their own savages, who were their servants, despatched
those poor creatures with their hatchets.
At length they came in view of the place where the more
miserable remains of the savages' army lay, where there
appeared about a hundred still; their posture was generally
sitting upon the ground, with their knees up towards their
mouth, and the head put between the two hands, leaning down
upon the knees.
When our men came within two musket-shot of them, the
Spaniard governor ordered two muskets to be fired without ball,
to alarm them; this he did, that by their countenance he might
know what to expect, viz., whether they were still in heart to
fight, or were so heartily beaten, as to be dispirited and dis-
couraged, and so he might manage accordingly.
This stratagem took; for as soon as the savages heard the
first gun, and saw the flash of the second, they started up from
their feet in the greatest consternation imaginable; and as our
men advanced swiftly towards them, they all ran screaming and
yawling away, with a kind of a howling noise, which our men
did not understand, and had never heard before; and thus they
ran up the hills into the country.
At first, our men had much rather the weather had been
calm, and they had all gone away to sea; but they did not then
consider that this might probably have been the occasion of
their coming again in such multitudes as not to be resisted; or,
at least, to come so many, and so often, as would quite desolate
the island and starve them. Will Atkins, therefore, who, not-
withstanding his wound, kept always with them, proved the best
counsellor in this case. His advice was, to take the advantage
that offered, and clap in between them and their boats, and so
deprive them of the capacity of ever returning any more to
plague the island.
They consulted long about this, and some were against it,
for fear of making the wretches fly to the woods, and live there
desperate; and so they should have them to hunt like wild
beasts, be afraid to stir out about their business, and have their
plantations continually rifled, all their tame goats destroyed,
and, in short, be reduced to a life of continual distress.
Will Atkins told them they had better have to do with a
hundred men, than with a hundred nations; that as they must
destroy their boats, so they must destroy the men, or be all of
them destroyed themselves. In a word, he showed them the
necessity of it so plainly, that they all came into it; so they
went to work immediately with the boats, and getting some dry
wood together from a dead tree, they tried to set some of them
on fire; but they were so wet that they would not burn. How-
ever, the fire so burned the upper part, that it soon made them
unfit for swimming in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw
what they were about, some of them came running out of the
woods, and coming as near as they could to our men, kneeled
down and cried, Oa, Oa, Waramoka, and some other words of
their language, which none of the others understood anything
of; but as they made pitiful gestures and strange noises, it was
easy to understand they begged to have their boats spared, and
that they would be gone, and never come there again.
But our men were now satisfied that they had no way to
preserve themselves or to save their colony, but effectually
to prevent any of these people from ever going home again;
depending upon this, that if ever so much as one of them got
back into their country to tell the story, the colony was undone
So that letting them know that they should not have any mercy,
they fell to work with their canoes, and destroyed them, every
one that the storm had not destroyed before; at the sight of
which the savages raised a hideous cry in the woods, which our
people heard plain enough; after which they ran about the
island like distracted men; so that, in a word, our men did not
really know at first what to do with them.
Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, consider that
while they made those people thus desperate, they ought to
have kept good guard at the same time upon their plantations;
for though it is true they had driven away their cattle, and the
Indians did not find out their main retreat, I mean my old castle
at the hill, nor the cave in the valley, yet they found out my
plantation at the bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and all the
fences and planting about it; trod all the corn under foot; tore
up the vines and grapes, being just then almost ripe, and did to
our men an inestimable damage, though to themselves not one
farthing worth of service.
Though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions,
yet they were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt them up
or down; for as they were too nimble of foot for our men when
they found them single, so our men durst not go about single
for fear of being surrounded with their numbers. The best was,
they had no weapons; for though they had bows, they had
no arrows left, nor any materials to make any, nor had they
any edged tool or weapon among them.
The extremity and distress they were reduced to was great,
and indeed deplorable, but at the same time our men were also
brought to very bad circumstances by them; for though their
retreats were preserved, yet their provision was destroyed, and
their harvest spoiled; and what to do, or which way to turn
themselves, they knew not. The only refuge they had now
was the stock of cattle they had in the valley by the cave, and
some little corn which grew there; and the plantation of the
three Englishmen, William Atkins and his comrades, who were
now reduced to two, one of them being killed by an arrow,
which struck him on the side of his head, just under the temple,
so that he never spoke more; and it was very remarkable, that
this was the same barbarous fellow who cut the poor savage
x
slave with his hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have
murdered all the Spaniards.
I looked upon this case to have been worse at this time
than mine was at any time after I first discovered the grains of
barley and rice, and got into the manner of planting and raising
my corn, and my tame cattle; for now they had, as I may say,
a hundred wolves upon the island, which would devour every-
thing they could come at, yet could very hardly be come at
themselves.
The first thing they concluded when they saw what their
circumstances were, was that they would, if possible, drive
them up to the farther part of the island, south-west, that if any
more savages came on shore, they might not find one another;
then that they would daily hunt and harass them, and kill as
many of them as they could come at, till they had reduced
their number; and if they could at last tame them, and bring
them to anything, they would give them corn, and teach them
how to plant, and live upon their daily labour.
In order to this they so followed them, and so terrified
them with their guns, that in a few days, if any of them fired a
gun at an Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he would fall down
for fear; and so dreadfully frighted they were, that they kept
out of sight farther and farther, till at last our men following
them, and every day almost killing and wounding some of
them, they kept up in the woods and hollow places so much,
that it reduced them to the utmost misery for want of food;
and many were afterwards found dead in the woods, without
any hurt, but merely starved to death.
When our men found this, it made their hearts relent, and
pity moved them; especially the Spaniard governor, who was
the most gentlemanly, generous-minded man that ever I met
within my life; and he proposed, if possible, to take one of
them alive, and bring him to understand what they meant, so
far as to be able to act as interpreter, and to go among them,
and see if they might be brought to some conditions that might
be depended upon, to save their lives, and to do us no spoil.
It was some while before any of them could be taken; but
being weak and half-starved, one of them was at last surprised,
and made a prisoner. He was sullen at first, and would neither
eat or drink; but finding himself kindly used, and victuals
given him, and no violence offered him, he at last grew tractable,
and came to himself.
They brought old Friday to him, who talked often with him,
and told him how kind the others would be to them all; that
they would not only save their lives, but would give them a
part of the island to live in, provided they would give satis-
faction that they would keep in their own bounds, and not
come beyond it, to injure or prejudice others; and that they
should have corn given them to plant and make it grow for
their bread, and some bread given them for their present
subsistence; and old Friday bade the fellow go and talk with
the rest of his countrymen, and see what they said to it, assuring
them that if they did not agree immediately they should be
all destroyed.
The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in
number to about thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at the
first offer, and begged to have some food given them; upon
which twelve Spaniards and two Englishmen, well armed, with
three Indian slaves, and old Friday, marched to the place where
they were. The three Indian slaves carried them a large
quantity of bread, some rice boiled up to cakes, and dried in
the sun, and three live goats; and they were ordered to go to
the side of a hill, where they sat down, ate the provisions very
thankfully, and were the most faithful fellows to their words
that could be thought of; for except when they came to beg
victuals and directions, they never came out of their bounds;
and there they lived when I came to the island, and I went to
see them.
They had taught them both to plant corn, make bread,
breed tame goats, and milk them; they wanted nothing but
wives, and they soon would have been a nation. They were
confined to a neck of land surrounded with high rocks behind
them, and lying plain towards the sea before them, on the
south-east corner of the island. They had land enough, and it
was very good and fruitful; they had a piece of land about a
mile and half broad, and three or four miles in length.
Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such as I
made for myself; and gave them among them twelve hatchets,
and three or four knives; and there they lived, the most
subjected innocent creatures that ever were heard of.
After this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity with
respect to the savages till I came to revisit them, which was
above two years; not but that now and then some canoes of
savages came on shore for their triumphal unnatural feasts;
but as they were of several nations, and, perhaps, had never
heard of those that came before, or the reason of it, they did
not make any search or inquiry after their countrymen; and
if they had, it would have been very hard to have found
them out.
Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all that
happened to them to my return, at least that was worth notice.
The Indians, or savages, were wonderfully civilised by them,
and they frequently went among them; but forbid, on pain of
death, any of the Indians coming to them, because they would
not have their settlement betrayed again.
One thing was very remarkable, viz., that they taught the
savages to make wicker-work, or baskets, but they soon outdid
their masters; for they made abundance of most ingenious
things in wicker-work; particularly all sorts of baskets, sieves,
bird-cages, cupboards, &c., as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds,
couches, and abundance of other things, being very ingenious
at such work when they were once put in the way of it.
My coming was a particular relief to these people, because
we furnished them with knives, scissors, spades, shovels, pick-
axes, and all things of that kind which they could want.
With the help of these tools they were so very handy, that
they came at last to build up their huts, or houses, very
handsomely; raddling, or working it up like basket-work all
the way round, which was a very extraordinary piece of
ingenuity, and looked very odd; but was an exceeding good
fence, as well against heat as against all sorts of vermin; and
our men were so taken with it, that they got the wild savages
to come and do the like for them; so that when I came to see
the two Englishmen's colonies, they looked, at a distance, as if
they lived all like bees in a hive. And as for Will Atkins, who
was now become a very industrious, necessary, and sober fellow,
he had made himself such a tent of basket-work as I believe
was never seen. And indeed this fellow showed abundance of
ingenuity in several things which he had no knowledge of.
He made him a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows to blow
the fire; he made himself charcoal for his work, and he formed
out of one of the iron crows a middling good anvil to hammer
upon; in this manner he made many things, but especially
hooks, staples, and spikes, bolts and hinges.
Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never seen in the
world; nor a house or tent so neatly contrived, much less so
built. In this great beehive lived the three families; that is to
say, Will Atkins and his companion; the third was killed,
but his wife remained with three children, and the other two
were not at all backward to give the widow her full share of
everything, I mean as to their corn, milk, grapes, &c., and when
they killed a kid, or found a turtle on the shore; so that they
all lived well enough, though it was true they were not so in-
dustrious as the other two, as has been observed already.
One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz., that is for
religion, I don't know that there was anything of that kind
among them. They pretty often indeed put one another in
mind that there was a God by the very common method of
seamen, viz., swearing by His name; nor were their poor,
ignorant, savage wives much the better for having been married
to Christians, as we must call them; for as they knew very
little of God themselves, so they were utterly incapable of
entering into any discourse with their wives about a God, or to
talk anything to them concerning religion.
The utmost of all the improvement which I can say the
wives had made from them was, that they had taught them to
speak English pretty well; and all the children they had, which
were near twenty in all, were taught to speak English too,
from their first learning to speak, though they at first spoke it
in a very broken manner, like their mothers. There were none
of these children above six years old when I came thither; for
it was not much above seven years that they had fetched these
five savage ladies over, but they had all children, more or less.
The mothers were all a good sort of well-governed, quiet,
laborious women, modest and decent, helpful to one another,
mighty observant and subject to their masters, I cannot call
them husbands; and wanted nothing but to be well instructed
in the Christian religion, and to be legally married; both which
were happily brought about afterwards by my means, or at
least in consequence of my coming among them.
Having thus given an account of the colony in general, and
pretty much of my five runagate Englishmen, I must say some-
thing of the Spaniards, who were the main body of the family,
and in whose story there are some incidents also remarkable
enough.
I had a great many discourses with them about their circum-
stances when they were among the savages. They told me
readily, that they had no instances to give of their application
or ingenuity in that country; that they were a poor, miserable,
dejected handful of people; that if means had been put into
their hands, they had yet so abandoned themselves to
despair, and so sunk under the weight of their misfortunes, that
they thought of nothing but starving. One of them, a grave
and very sensible man, told me he was convinced they were in
the wrong; that it was not the part of wise men to give up
themselves to their misery, but always to take hold of the helps
which reason offered, as well for present support, as for future
deliverance. He told me that grief was the most senseless in-
significant passion in the world; for that it regarded only things
past, which was generally impossible to be recalled or to be
remedied, but had no views to things to come, and had no share
in anything that looked like deliverance, but rather added to
the affliction than proposed a remedy; and upon this he
repeated a Spanish proverb, which though I cannot repeat in
just the same words that he spoke in, yet I remember I made it
into an English proverb of my own, thus:
In trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your trouble doubled.
He ran on then in remarks upon all the little improvements I
had made in my solitude; my unwearied application,as he called
it, and how I had made a condition, which in its circumstances
was at first much worse than theirs, a thousand times more
happy than theirs was even now, when they were all together.
He told me it was remarkable that Englishmen had a greater
presence of mind in their distress than any people that ever he
met with; that their unhappy nation, and the Portuguese, were
the worst men in the world to struggle with misfortunes; for
their first step in dangers, after the common efforts are over,
was always to despair, lie down under it and die, without rous-
ing their thoughts up to proper remedies for escape.
They described, most affectionately, how they were surprised
with joy at the return of their friend and companion in misery,
who they thought had been devoured by wild beasts of the
worst kind, viz., by wild men; and yet how more and more they
were surprised with the account he gave them of his errand,
and that there was a Christian in any place near, much more
one that was able, and had humanity enough, to contribute to
their deliverance.
They described how they were astonished at the sight of the
relief I sent them, and at the appearance of loaves of bread,
things they had not seen since their coming to that miserable
place; how often they crossed it, and blessed it, as bread sent
from heaven; and what a reviving cordial it was to their spirits
to taste it, as also of the other things I had sent for their supply.
And after all, they would have told me something of the joy
they were in at the sight of a boat and pilots to carry them away
to the person and place from whence all these new comforts
came; but they told me it was impossible to express it by
words, for their excessive joy naturally driving them to unbe-
coming extravagances, they had no way to describe them but
by telling me that they bordered upon lunacy, having no way to
give vent to their passion suitable to the sense that was upon
them; that in some it worked one way, and in some another;
and that some of them, through a surprise of joy, would burst
out into tears; others be stark mad, and others immediately
faint. This discourse extremely affected me, and called to my
mind Friday's ecstasy when he met his father, and the poor
people's ecstasy when I took them up at sea, after their ship
was on fire; the mate of the ship's joy, when he found himself
delivered in the place where he expected to perish; and my
own joy, when after twenty-eight years' captivity I found a
good ship ready to carry me to my own country. All these
things made me more sensible of the relation of those poor men,
and more affected with it.
Having thus given a view of the state of things as I found
them, I must relate the heads of what I did for these people,
and the condition in which I left them. It was their opinion,
and mine too, that they would be troubled no more with the
savages; or that, if they were, they would be able to cut them
off, if they were twice as many as before; so they had no
concern about that. Then I entered into a serious discourse
with the Spaniard, whom I called governor, about their stay
in the island; for I was not come to carry any of them off, so
it would not be just to carry off some and leave others, who
perhaps would be unwilling to stay if their strength was
diminished.
On the other hand, I told them I came to establish them
there, not to remove them; and then I let them know that I
had brought with me relief of sundry kinds for them; that I
had been at a great charge to supply them with all things
necessary, as well for their convenience as their defence; and
that I had such and such particular persons with me, as well
to increase and recruit their number, as by the particular
necessary employments which they were bred to, being artificers,
to assist them in those things in which at present they were
to seek.
They were all together when I talked thus to them ; and
before I delivered to them the stores I had brought, I asked
them, one by one, if they had entirely forgot and buried the
first animosities that had been among them, and would shake
hands with one another, and engage in a strict friendship and
union of interest, that so there might be no more misunder-
standings or jealousies.
Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and good-humour,
said they had met with afflictions enough to make them all
sober, and enemies enough to make them all friends; that for
his part, he would live and die with them; and was so far from
designing anything against the Spaniards, that he owned they
had done nothing to him but what his own mad humours made
necessary, and what he would have done, and perhaps much
worse, in their case; and that he would ask them pardon, if I
WE MADE A SPLENDID FEAST
desired it, for the foolish and brutish things he had done to
them; and was very willing and desirous of living in terms of
entire friendship and union with them, and would do anything
that lay in his power to convince them of it; and as for going
to England, he cared not if he did not go thither these twenty
years.
The Spaniards said they had indeed at first disarmed and
excluded Will Atkins and his two countrymen, for their ill con-
duct, as they had let me know; and they appealed to me for the
necessity they were under to do so; but that Will Atkins had
behaved himself so bravely in the great fight they had with
the savages, and on several occasions since, and had shown
himself so faithful to, and concerned for, the general interest of
them all, that they had forgotten all that was past, and thought
he merited as much to be trusted with arms, and to be
supplied with necessaries, as any of them; and that they had
testified their satisfaction in him by committing the command
to him, next to the governor himself; and as they had an entire
confidence in him and all his countrymen, so they acknowledged
they had merited that confidence by all the methods that honest
men could merit to be valued and trusted; and they most
heartily embraced the occasion of giving me this assurance,
that they would never have any interest separate from one
another.
Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship, we
appointed the next day to dine all together, and indeed we made
a splendid feast. I caused the ship's cook and his mate to
come on shore and dress our dinner, and the old cook's mate
we had on shore assisted. We brought on shore six pieces of
good beef, and four pieces of pork, out of the ship's provision,
with our punch-bowl, and materials to fill it; and in particular,
gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of
English beer, things that neither the Spaniards or the English-
men had tasted for many years, and which it may be supposed
they were exceeding glad of.
The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids, which the
cooks roasted; and three of them were sent, covered up close,
on board the ship to the seamen, that they might feast on fresh
meat from on shore, as we did with their salt meat from on board.
After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I
brought out my cargo of goods, wherein, that there might be
no dispute about dividing, I showed them that there was sufficient
for them all; and desired that they might all take an equal
quantity of the goods that were for wearing; that is to say,
equal when made up. As first, I distributed linen sufficient to
make every one of them four shirts; and, at the Spaniards'
request, afterwards made them up six; these were exceeding
comfortable to them, having been what, as I may say, they had
long since forgot the use of, or what it was to wear them.
I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I mentioned before,
to make every one a light coat like a frock, which I judged
fittest for the heat of the season, cool and loose; and ordered
that whenever they decayed they should make more, as they
thought fit. The like for pumps, shoes, stockings, and hats,&c.
I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction, sat upon
the countenances of all these poor men when they saw the care
I had taken of them, and how well I had furnished them. They
told me I was a father to them; and that having such a corre-
spondent as I was in so remote a part of the world, it would
make them forget that they were left in a desolate place; and
they all voluntarily engaged to me not to leave the place with-
out my consent
.
Then I presented to them the people I had brought with
me, particularly the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters,
all of them most necessary people; but above all my general
artificer, than whom they could not name anything that was
more useful to them; and the tailor, to show his concern for
them, went to work immediately, and, with my leave, made
them every one a shirt the first thing he did; and which was
still more, he taught the women not only how to sew and stitch,
and use the needle, but made them assist to make the shirts for
their husbands and for all the rest.
As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they
were, for they took in pieces all my clumsy unhandy things,
and made them clever convenient tables, stools, bedsteads, cup-
boards, lockers, shelves, and everything they wanted of that
kind.
But to let them see how Nature made artificers at first, I
carried the carpenters to see Will Atkins's basket-house, as I
called it, and they both owned they never saw an instance of
such natural ingenuity before, nor anything so regular and so
handily built, at least of its kind; and one of them, when he
saw it, after musing a good while, turning about to me, " I am
sure," says he, "that man has no need of us; you need do
nothing but give him tools."
Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave every
man a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had no harrows
or ploughs; and to every separate place a pickaxe, crow, a
broad axe, and a saw; always appointing, that as often as any
were broken, or worn-out, they should be supplied, without
grudging, out of the general stores that I left behind.
Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives, scissors, and
all sorts of tools and iron-work, they had without tale as they
required; for no man would care to take more than they wanted,
and he must be a fool that would waste or spoil them on any
account whatever; and for the use of the smith I left two tons
of unwrought iron for a supply.
My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them was
such, even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice at them;
for now they could march, as I used to do, with a musket upon
each shoulder, if there was occasion; and were able to fight a
thousand savages, if they had but some little advantages of
situation, which also they could not miss of if they had occasion.
I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother was
starved to death, and the maid also; she was a sober, well-
educated, religious young woman, and behaved so inoffensively,
that every one gave her a good word. She had, indeed, an
unhappy life with us, there being no woman in the ship but
herself; but she bore it with patience. After a while, seeing
things so well ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving upon my
island, and considering that they had neither business or
acquaintance in the East Indies, or reason for taking so long a
voyage; I say, considering all this, both of them came to me,
and desired I would give them leave to remain on the island,
and be entered among my family, as they called it.
I agreed to it readily, and they had a little plat of ground
allotted to them, where they had three tents or houses set up,
surrounded with a basket-work, palisadoed like Atkins's, adjoin-
ing to his plantation. Their tents were contrived so, that they
had each of them a room apart to lodge in, and a middle tent,
like a great storehouse, to lay all their goods in, and to eat and
drink in. And now the other two Englishmen removed their
habitation to the same place, and so the island was divided
into two colonies, and no more, viz., the Spaniards, with old
Friday and the first servants, at my old habitation under the
hill, which was, in a word, the capital city, and where they had
so enlarged and extended their works, as well under as on the
outside of the hill, that they lived, though perfectly concealed,
yet full at large. Never was there such a little city in a wood,
and so hid, I believe, in any part of the world; for 1 verily
believe a thousand men might have ranged the island a month,
and if they had not known there was such a thing, and looked
on purpose for it, they would not have found it; for the trees
stood so thick and so close, and grew so fast matted into one
another, that nothing but cutting them down first could discover
the place, except the only two narrow entrances where they
went in and out could be found, which was not very easy. One
of them was just down at the water edge of the creek, and it
was afterwards above two hundred yards to the place; and the
other was up the ladder at twice, as I have already formerly
described it; and they had a large wood, thick planted, also on
the top of the hill, which contained above an acre, which grew
apace, and covered the place from all discovery there, with only
one narrow place between two trees, not easy to be discovered,
to enter on that side.
The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where there were
four families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, with
their wives and children; three savages that were slaves; the
widow and children of the Englishman that was killed; the
young man and the maid; and by the way, we made a wife of
her also before we went away. There were also the two
carpenters and the tailor, whom I brought with me for them,
also the smith, who was a very necessary man to them,
especially as a gunsmith, to take care of their arms; and my
other man, whom I called Jack-of-all-trades, who was in him-
self as good almost as twenty men, for he was not only a very
ingenious fellow, but a very merry fellow; and before I went
away we married him to the honest maid that came with the
youth in the ship I mentioned before.
And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to say
something of the French ecclesiastic that I had brought with
me out of the ship's crew whom I took up at sea. It is true
this man was a Roman, and perhaps it may give offence to
some hereafter if I leave anything extraordinary upon record
of a man whom, before I begin, I must, to set him out in just
colours, represent in terms very much to his disadvantage in
the account of Protestants; as, first, that he was a Papist;
secondly, a Popish priest; and thirdly, a French Popish priest.
But justice demands of me to give him a due character; and
I must say, he was a grave, sober, pious, and most religious
person ; exact in his life, extensive in his charity, and
exemplary in almost everything he did. What, then, can any
one say against my being very sensible of the value of such a
man, notwithstanding his profession? though it may be my
opinion, perhaps, as well as the opinion of others who shall read
this, that he was mistaken.
The first hour that I began to converse with him, after he
had agreed to go with me to the East Indies, I tound reason to
delight exceedingly in his conversation; and he first began with
me about religion, in the most obliging manner imaginable.
"Sir," says he, "you have not only, under God" (and at
that he crossed his breast), "saved my life, but you have
admitted me to go this voyage in your ship, and by your
obliging civility have taken me into your family, giving me an
opportunity of free conversation. Now, sir," says he, "you see
by my habit what my profession is, and I guess by your nation
what yours is; I may think it is my duty, and doubtless it is
so, to use my utmost endeavours on all occasions to bring all
the souls I can to the knowledge of the truth, and to embrace
the Catholic doctrine; but as I am here under your permission,
and in your family, I am bound, in justice to your kindness, as
well as in decency and good manners, to be under your govern-
ment; and therefore I shall not, without your leave, enter into
any debates on the point of religion, in which we may not
agree, farther than you shall give me leave."
He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of the
many extraordinary events of it ; of many adventures which
had befallen him in the few years that he had been abroad in the
world, and particularly this was very remarkable, viz., that in
the voyage he was now engaged, he had had the misfortune to
be five times shipped and unshipped, and never to go to the
place whither any of the ships he was in were at first designed;
that his first intent was to have gone to Martinico, and that he
went on board a ship bound thither at St Malo; but being
forced into Lisbon by bad weather, the ship received some
damage by running aground in the mouth of the river Tagus,
and was obliged to unload her cargo there; that finding a
Portuguese ship there bound to the Madeiras, and ready to sail,
and supposing he should easily meet with the vessel there
bound to Martinico, he went on board, in order to sail to the
Madeiras; but the master of the Portuguese ship being but an
indifferent mariner, had been out in his reckoning, and they
drove to Fayal; where, however, he happened to find a very good
market for his cargo, which was corn, and therefore resolved not
to go to the Madeiras, but to load salt at the Isle of May,
and go away to Newfoundland. He had no remedy in this
exigence but to go with the ship, and had a pretty good voyage
as far as the Banks, so they call the place where they catch the
fish, where meeting with a French ship bound from France to
Quebec, in the river of Canada, and from thence to Martinico,
to carry provisions, he thought he should have an opportunity
to complete his first design. But when he came to Quebec
the master of the ship died, and the ship proceeded no farther.
So the next voyage he shipped himself for France, in the ship
that was burnt, when we took them up at sea, and then shipped
with us for the East Indies, as I have already said. Thus he
had been disappointed in five voyages, all, as I may call it, in
one voyage, besides what I shall have occasion to mention
farther of the same person.
But I shall not make digressions into other men's stories
which have no relation to my own. I return to what concerns
our affair in the island. He came to me one morning, for he
lodged among us all the while we were upon the island, and it
happened to be just when I was going to visit the Englishmen's

So WB WALKED ON.
colony at the farthest part of the island; I say, he came to me,
and told me with a very grave countenance that he had for two
or three days desired an opportunity of some discourse with
me, which he hoped would not be displeasing to me, because he
thought it might in some measure correspond with my general
design, which was the prosperity of my new colony, and per-
haps might put it at least more than he yet thought it was in
the way of God's blessing.
I told him I was going to the Englishmen's plantations,
and asked him to go with me, and we might discourse of it by
the way. He told me he would more willingly wait on me
thither, because there, partly, the thing was acted which he
desired to speak to me about. So we walked on, and I pressed
him to be free and plain with me in what he had to say.
"First, sir," says he, "you have here four Englishmen, who
have fetched women from among the savages, and have taken
them as their wives, and have had many children by them all,
and yet are not married to them after any stated legal manner,
as the laws of God and man require; and therefore are yet, in
the sense of both, no less than adulterers, and living in adultery.
To this, sir," says he, " I know you will object, that there was
no clergyman or priest of any kind, or of any profession, to
perform the ceremony; nor any pen and ink, or paper, to write
down a contract of marriage, and have it signed between
them. And I know also, sir, what the Spaniard governor has
told you; I mean of the agreement that he obliged them to
make when they took these women, viz., that they should
choose them out by consent, and keep separately to them;
which, by the way, is nothing of a marriage, no agreement with
the women as wives, but only an agreement among themselves,
to keep them from quarrelling.
"But, sir, the essence of the sacrament of matrimony (so he
called it, being a Roman) consists not only in the mutual
consent of the parties to take one another as man and wife,
but in the formal and legal obligation that there is in the con-
tract to compel the man and woman at all times to own and
acknowledge each other; obliging the men to abstain from all
other women, to engage in no other contract while these
subsist; and on all occasions, as ability allows, to provide
honestly for them and their children; and to oblige the women
to the same, or like conditions, mutatis mutandis, on their side.
"Now, sir," says he, "these men may, when they please,
or when occasion presents, abandon these women, disown their
children, leave them to perish, and take other women and
marry them whilst these are living." And here he added with
some warmth, "How, sir, is God honoured in this unlawful
liberty? It is certainly in your power now to put an end to it,
and in nobody's power but yours."
I was so dull still, that I did not take him right, but I
imagined that by putting an end to it he meant that I should
part them, and not suffer them to live together any longer;
and I said to him I could not do this by any means, for that it
would put the whole island into confusion. He seemed sur-
prised that I should so far mistake him. "No, sir," says he, " I
do not mean that you should now separate them, but legally
and effectually marry them now; and as, sir, my way of marry-
ing them may not be so easy to reconcile them to, though it
will be as effectual even by your own laws; so your way may
be as well before God, and as valid among men; I mean by a
written contract, signed by both man and woman, and by all
the witnesses present, which all the laws of Europe would
decree to be valid."
I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much
sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in his dis-
course, as to his own party or church, and such true warmth for
the preserving people that he had no knowledge of or relation
to; I say, for preserving them from transgressing the laws of
God; the like of which I had indeed not met with anywhere.
But recollecting what he had said of marrying them by a
written contract, which I knew would stand too, I returned it
back upon him, and told him I granted all that he had said to
be just, and on his part very kind; that I would discourse with
the men upon the point now, when I came to them; and I
knew no reason why they should scruple to let him marry them
all; which I knew well enough would be granted to be as
authentic and valid in England, as if they were married by one
of our own clergymen. What was afterwards done in this
matter, I shall speak of by itself.
I then pressed him to tell me what was the second com-
plaint which he had to make, acknowledging that I was very
much his debtor for the first, and thanked him heartily for it.
He told me he would use the same freedom and plainness in
the second, and hoped I would take it as well ; and this was,
that notwithstanding these English subjects of mine, as he
called them, had lived with those women for almost seven
years, had taught them to speak English, and even to read it;
and that they were, as he perceived, women of tolerable under-
standing and capable of instruction; yet they had not to this
hour taught them anything of the Christian religion; no, not
so much as to know that there was a God, or a worship, or in
what manner God was to be served; or that their own idolatry,
and worshipping they knew not whom, was false and absurd.
"Now, sir," said he, "though I do not acknowledge your
religion, or you mine, yet we should be glad to see the devil's
servants, and the subjects of his kingdom, taught to know the
general principles of the Christian religion; that they might at
least hear of God, and of a Redeemer, and of the resurrection,
Y
and of a future state, things which we all believe; they had at
least been so much nearer coming into the bosom of the true
church, than they are now in the public profession of idolatry
and devil worship."
"But what can be done now ?" said I; "you see I am going
away."—" Will you give me leave," said he, "to talk with
these poor men about it ?"—" Yes, with all my heart," said I;
"and I will oblige them to give heed to what you say too."—
"As to that," said he, "we must leave them to the mercy of
Christ; but it is our business to assist them, encourage them,
and instruct them; and if you will give me leave, and God His
blessing, I do not doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be
brought home into the great circle of Christianity, into the
particular faith that we all embrace; and that even while you
stay here." Upon this I said, " I shall not only give you leave,
but give you a thousand thanks for it." What followed on this
account I shall mention also again in its place.
I now pressed him for the third article in which we were to
blame. "Why really," says he, " it is of the same nature, and I
will proceed, asking your leave, with the same plainness as
before; it is about your poor savages, who are, as I may say,
your conquered subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that is, or ought
to be received among all Christians, of what Church, or pre-
tended Church soever, viz., The Christian knowledge ought to
be propagated by all possible means, and on all possible occa-
sions. 'Tis on this principle that our Church sends missionaries
into Persia, India, and China; and that our clergy, even of the
superior sort, willingly engage in the most hazardous voyages,
and the most dangerous residence among murderers and
barbarians, to teach them the knowledge of the true God, and
to bring them over to embrace the Christian faith. Now, sir,
you have such an opportunity here to have six or seven and
thirty poor savages brought over from idolatry to the know-
ledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how
you can pass such an occasion of doing good, which is really
worth the expense of a man's whole life."
I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one word to
say; I had here a spirit of true Christian zeal for God and
religion before me, let his particular principles be of what kind
soever. He looked earnestly at me, seeing me in some dis-
order. "Sir," says he, "I shall be very sorry if what I have
said gives you any offence."—" No, no," says I, " I am offended
with nobody but myself; but I am perfectly confounded not
only to think that I should never take any notice of this before,
but with reflecting what notice I am able to take of it now.
You know, sir," said I, "what circumstances I am in; I am
bound to the East Indies, in a ship freighted by merchants, and
to whom it would be an insufferable piece of injustice to detain
their ship here, the men lying all this while at victuals and
wages upon the owners' account. It is true I agreed to be
allowed twelve days here, and if I stay more I must pay £3
sterling per diem demurrage; nor can I stay upon demurrage
above eight days more, and I have been here thirteen days
already, so that I am perfectly unable to engage in this work,
unless I would suffer myself to be left behind here again; in
which case, if this single ship should miscarry in any part of her
voyage, I should be just in the same condition that I was left in
here at first, and from which I have been so wonderfully delivered."
He owned the case was very hard upon me as to my voyage,
but laid it home upon my conscience, whether the blessing of
saving seven and thirty souls was not worth my venturing all I
had in the world for? I was not so sensible of that as he was.
I returned upon him thus: "Why, sir, it is a valuable thing
indeed to be an instrument in God's hand to convert seven and
thirty heathens to the knowledge of Christ; but as you are
an ecclesiastic, and are given over to the work, so that it seems
so naturally to fall into the way of your profession, how is it that
you do not rather offer yourself to undertake it, than press me
to it?"
Upon this he faced about, just before me, as we walked
along, and putting me to a full stop, made me a very low bow.
"I most heartily thank God, and you, sir," says he, " for giving
me so evident a call to so blessed a work; and if you think
yourself discharged from it, and desire me to undertake it, I
will most readily do it, and think it a happy reward for all the
hazards and difficulties of such a broken disappointed voyage
as I have met with, that I may be dropped at last into so
glorious a work."
I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke
this to me; his eyes sparkled like fire, his face glowed, and his
colour came and went as if he had been falling into fits; in a
word, he was fired with the joy of being embarked in such a
work. "Yes, sir," says he, "I would give Christ and the
Blessed Virgin thanks all my days, if I could be made the least
happy instrument of saving the souls of these poor men, though
I was never to set my foot off this island, or see my native
country any more. But since you will honour me," says he,
"with putting me into this work, for which I will pray for you
all the days of my life, I have one humble petition to you," said
he, " besides."—" What is that?" said I.—" Why," says he, "it
is, that you will leave your man Friday with me, to be my
interpreter to them, and to assist me; for without some help I
cannot speak to them, or they to me."
I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday, because I
could not think of parting with him, and that for many reasons.
He had been the companion of my travels; he was not only faith-
ful to me, but sincerely affectionate to the last degree; and I had
resolved to do something considerable for him if he outlived
me, as it was probable he would. Then I knew that as I had bred
Friday up to be a Protestant, it would quite confound him to
bring him to embrace another profession; and he would never,
while his eyes were open, believe that his old master was a
heretic, and would be damned; and this might in the end ruin
the poor fellow's principles, and so turn him to his first
idolatry.
However, a sudden thought relieved me in this strait, and it
was this: I told him I could not say that I was willing to part
with Friday on any account whatever; though a work that to
him was of more value than his life, ought to be to me of much
less value than the keeping or parting with a servant; but on
the other hand, I was persuaded that Friday would by no
means consent to part with me; and I could not force him to
it without his consent without manifest injustice, because I had
promised and engaged him to me that he would never leave me
unless I put him away.
He seemed very much concerned at it; for he had no
rational access to these poor people, seeing he did not under-
stand one word of their language, nor they one word of his.
To remove this difficulty, I told him Friday's father had learnt
Spanish, which I found he also understood, and he should serve
him for an interpreter; so he was much better satisfied, and
nothing could persuade him but he would stay to endeavour to
convert them; but Providence gave another and very happy
turn to all this.
I come back now to the first part of his objections. When
we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them all together; and
after some account given them of what I had done for them,
viz., what necessary things I had provided for them, and how
they were distributed, which they were very sensible of, and
very thankful for, I began to talk to them of the scandalous
life they led, and gave them a full account of the notice the
clergyman had already taken of it; and arguing how un-
christian and irreligious a life it was, I first asked them if they
were married men or bachelors? They soon explained their
condition to me, and showed me that two of them were
widowers, and the other three were single men or bachelors. I
asked them with what consciences they could take these
women, call them their wives, and not be married lawfully to
them?
They all gave me the answer that I expected, viz., that there
was nobody to marry them; that they agreed before the
governor to keep them as their wives, and to keep them and
own them as their wives; and they thought, as things stood
with them, they were as legally married as if they had been
married by a parson, and with all the formalities in the world.
I told them that no doubt they were married in the sight of
God, and were bound in conscience to keep them as their
wives; but that the laws of men being otherwise, they might
pretend they were not married, and so desert the poor women
and children hereafter; and that their wives, being poor,
desolate women, friendless and moneyless, would have no way
to help themselves. I therefore told them, that unless I was
assured of their honest intent, I could do nothing for them;
but would take care that what I did should be for the women
and their children without them; and that unless they would
give some assurances that they would marry the women, I could
not think it was convenient they should continue together as
man and wife; for that it was both scandalous to men and
offensive to God, who they could not think would bless them if
they went on thus.
All this went on as I expected; and they told me, especially
Will Atkins, who seemed now to speak for the rest, that they
loved their wives as well as if they had been born in their own
native country, and would not leave them upon any account
whatever; and they did verily believe their wives were as
virtuous and as modest, and did to the utmost of their skill as
much for them and for their children as any women could
possibly do, and they would not part with them on any account;
and Will Atkins for his own particular added, if any man would
take him away, and offer to carry him home to England, and
make him captain of the best man-of-war in the navy, he would
not go with him if he might not carry his wife and children
with him; and if there was a clergyman in the ship, he would
be married to her now with all his heart.
This was just as I would have it. The priest was not with
me at that moment, but was not far off; so to try him farther,
I told him I had a clergyman with me, and if he was sincere I
would have him married the next morning, and bid him con-
sider of it, and talk with the rest. He said, as for himself, he
need not consider of it at all, for he was very ready to do it, and
was glad I had a minister with me; and he believed they would
be all willing also. I then told him that my friend the minister
was a Frenchman, and could not speak English, but that I
would act the clerk between them. He never so much as asked
me whether he was Papist or Protestant, which was indeed
what I was afraid of; but, I say, they never inquired about it.
So we parted; I went back to my clergyman, and Will Atkins
went in to talk with his companions. I desired the French
gentleman not to say anything to them till the business was
thorough ripe, and I told him what answer the men had given
me.
Before I went from their quarter they all came to me, and
told me they had been considering what I had said; that they
were very glad to hear I had a clergyman in my company;
and they were very willing to give me the satisfaction I desired,
and to be formally married as soon as I pleased; for they were
far from desiring to part with their wives; and that they meant
nothing but what was very honest when they chose them. So
I appointed them to meet me the next morning, and that in
the meantime they should let their wives know the meaning of
the marriage law; and that it was not only to prevent any
scandal, but also to oblige them that they should not forsake
them, whatever might happen.
The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of
the thing, and were very well satisfied with it, as indeed they
had reason to be; so they failed not to attend all together at
my apartment the next morning, where I brought out my
clergyman ; and though he had not on a minister's gown, after the
manner of England, or the habit of a priest, after the manner
of France; yet having a black vest, something like a cassock,
with a sash round it, he did not look very unlike a minister;
and as for his language, I was his interpreter.
But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and the
scruples he made of marrying the women because they were
not baptized and professed Christians, gave them an exceeding
reverence for his person; and there was no need after that to
inquire whether he was a clergyman or no.
Indeed I was afraid his scruple would have been carried so
far as that he would not have married them at all; nay, not-
withstanding all I was able to say to him he resisted me, though
modestly, yet very steadily, and at last refused absolutely to
marry them unless he had first talked with the men and the
women too; and though at first I was a little backward to it,
yet at last I agreed to it with a good will, perceiving the
sincerity of his design.
When he came to them, he let them know that I had
acquainted him with their circumstances, and with the present
design; that he was very willing to perform that part of his
function, and marry them as I had desired; but that before he
could do it, he must take the liberty to talk with them.
He told them, he doubted they were but indifferent
Christians; that they had but little knowledge of God or of
His ways, and therefore he could not expect that they had said
much to their wives on that head yet; but that unless they
would promise him to use their endeavour with their wives to
persuade them to become Christians, and would, as well as they
could, instruct them in the knowledge and belief of God that
made them, and to worship Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he
could not marry them; for he would have no hand in joining
Christians with savages; nor was it consistent with the
principles of the Christian religion, and was indeed expressly
forbidden in God's law.
They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it very
faithfully to them from his mouth, as near his own words as I
could, only sometimes adding something of my own to convince
them how just it was, and how I was of his mind; and I always
very faithfully distinguished between what I said for myself
and what were the clergyman's words. They told me it was
very true what the gentleman had said, that they were but very
indifferent Christians themselves, and that they never talked to
their wives about religion.—" Lord, sir," says Will Atkins, " how
should we teach them religion? Why, we know nothing our-
selves; and besides, sir," said he, " should we go to talk to them
of God, and Jesus Christ, and heaven and hell,'twould be to
make them laugh at us, and ask us what we believe ourselves;
and if we should tell them we believe all the things that we
speak of to them, such as of good people going to heaven, and
wicked people to the devil, they would ask us where we intend
to go ourselves that believe all this, and are such wicked fellows,
as we indeed are. Why, sir, 'tis enough to give them a surfeit of
religion at first hearing. Folks must have some religion them-
selves before they pretend to teach other people."—" Will
Atkins," said I to him, " though I am afraid what you say has
too much truth in it, yet can you not tell your wife that she's in
the wrong;; that there is a God, and a religion better than her
own; that her gods are idols; that they can neither hear or
speak; that there is a great Being that made all things, and
that can destroy all that He had made; that He rewards the
good, and punishes the bad; and that we are to be judged by
Him, at last, for all we do here? You are not so ignorant but
even Nature itself will teach you that all this is true; and I am
satisfied you know it all to be true, and believe it yourself."
"That's true, sir," said Atkins; "but with what face can I
say anything to my wife of all this, when she will tell me im-
mediately it cannot be true ?"—" Not true!" said I; "what do
you mean by that?"—"Why, sir," said he, "she will tell me it
cannot be true; that this God I shall tell her of can be just, or
can punish or reward, since I am not punished and sent to the
devil, that have been such a wicked creature, as she knows I
have been, even to her, and to everybody else; and that I
should be suffered to live, that have been always acting so
contrary to what I must tell her is good, and to what I ought to
have done."
"Why truly, Atkins," said I, " I am afraid thou speakest too
much truth;" and with that I let the clergyman know what
Atkins had said, for he was impatient to know. "Oh !" said
the priest, "tell him there is one thing will make him the best
minister in the world to his wife, and that is repentance; for
none teach repentance like true penitents. Let him but repent
for himself, he will be an excellent preacher of repentance to
his wife."
I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the
while, and who, we could easily perceive, was more than
ordinarily affected with it; but it seemed as if he turned off the
discourse to the rest; for he said to me he would go and have
some talk with his wife; so he went out awhile, and we talked
to the rest. I perceived they were all stupidly ignorant as to
matters of religion, much as I was when I went rambling away
from my father; and yet that there were none of them back-
ward to hear what had been said; and all of them seriously
promised that they would talk with their wives about it, and do
their endeavour to persuade them to turn Christians.
The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported what
answer they gave, but said nothing a good while; but at last
shaking his head, "We that are Christ's servants," says he,
"can go no further than to exhort and instruct; and when men
comply, submit to the reproof, and promise what we ask, 'tis all
we can do. We are bound to accept their good words; but
believe me, sir," said he, "whatever you may have known of the
life of that man you call Will Atkins, I believe he is the only
sincere convert among them. I take that man to be a true
penitent; I won't despair of the rest, but that man is apparently
struck with the sense of his past life; and I doubt not but
when he comes to talk religion to his wife, he will talk himself
effectually into it; for attempting to teach others is sometimes
the best way of teaching ourselves."
Upon this discourse, however, and their promising, as above,
to endeavour to persuade their wives to embrace Christianity,
he married the other three couple; but Will Atkins and his
wife were not yet come in. After this my clergyman, waiting
awhile, was curious to know where Atkins was gone; and
turning to me, says he, " I entreat you, sir, let us walk out of
your labyrinth here and look; I dare say we shall find this
poor man somewhere or other talking seriously to his wife, and
teaching her already something of religion." I began to be of
the same mind; so we went out together, and I carried him a
way which none knew but myself, and where the trees were so
thick set, as that it was not easy to see through the thicket of
leaves, and far harder to see in than to see out; when coming
to the edge of the wood I saw Atkins and his tawny savage
wife sitting under the shade of a bush, very eager in discourse.
I stopped short till my clergyman came up to me, and then
having showed him where they were, we stood and looked very
steadily at them a good while.
We observed him very earnest with her, pointing up to the
sun, and to every quarter of the heavens, then down to the
earth, then out to the sea, then to himself, then to her, to the
woods, to the trees. "Now," says my clergyman, "you see my
words are made good, the man preaches to her; mark him
now, he is telling her that our God has made him, and her,
and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the woods, the trees, &c."
—"I believe he is," said I. Immediately we perceived Will
Atkins start up upon his feet, fall down on his knees, and lift up
both his hands; we suppose he said something, but we could
not hear him; it was too far for that. He did not continue
kneeling half a minute, but comes and sits down again by his
wife, and talks to her again. We perceived then the woman
very attentive, but whether she said anything or no we could
not tell. While the poor fellow was upon his knees, I could
see the tears run plentifully down my clergyman's cheeks, and
I could hardly forbear myself; but it was a great affliction to

us both that we were not near enough to hear anything that
passed between them.
Well, however, we could come no nearer for fear of disturb-
ing them; so we resolved to see an end of this piece of still
conversation, and it spoke loud enough to us without the help
of voice. He sat down again, as I have said, close by her, and
talked again earnestly to her, and two or three times we could
see him embrace her most passionately; another time we saw
him take out his handkerchief and wipe her eyes, and then kiss
her again, with a kind of transport very unusual; and after
several of these things we see him, on a sudden, jump up again,
and lend her his hand to help her up, when immediately leading
her by the hand a step or two, they both kneeled down
together, and continued so about two minutes.
After the poor man and his wife were risen again from their
knees, we observed he stood talking still eagerly to her; and
we observed by her motion that she was greatly affected with
what he said, by her frequent lifting up her hands, laying her
hand to her breast, and such other postures as usually express
the greatest seriousness and attention. This continued about
half a quarter of an hour, and then they walked away too; so
that we could see no more of them in that situation.
I took this interval to talk with my clergyman; and first I
told him, I was glad to see the particulars we had both been
witnesses to; that though I was hard enough of belief in such
cases, yet that I began to think it was all very sincere here,
both in the man and his wife, however ignorant they might
both be; and I hoped such a beginning would have a yet more
happy end; "and who knows," said I, " but these two may in
time, by instruction and example, work upon some of the
others?"—"Some of them! "said he, turning quick upon me,
"ay, upon all of them. Depend upon it, if those two savages,
for he has been but little better as you relate it, should embrace
Jesus Christ, they will never leave till they work upon all the
rest; for true religion is naturally communicative, and he that
is once made a Christian will never leave a pagan behind him
if he can help it." I owned it was a most Christian principle
to think so, and a testimony of a true zeal, as well as a generous
heart in him. "But, my friend," said I," will you give me leave
to start one difficulty here? I cannot tell how to object the
least thing against that affectionate concern which you show
for the turning the poor people from their paganism to the
Christian religion; but how does this comfort you, while these
people are, in your account, out of the pale of the Catholic
Church, without which, you believe, there is no salvation, so
that you esteem these but heretics; and for other reasons, as
effectually lost as the pagans themselves?"
To this he answered with abundance of candour and
Christian charity, thus: "Sir, I am a Catholic of the Roman
Church, and a priest of the order of St Benedict, and I embrace
all the principles of the Roman faith; but yet, if you will
believe me, and that I do not speak in compliment to you, or
in respect to my circumstances and your civilities; I say,
nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who call yourselves
reformed, without some charity. I dare not say, though I
know it is our opinion in general—I say, I dare not say that you
cannot be saved; I will by no means limit the mercy of Christ
so far as to think that He cannot receive you into the bosom
of His Church, in a manner to us unperceivable, and which it is
impossible for us to know; and I hope you have the same
charity for us."
I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this truly pious
Papist, as much as I was oppressed by the power of his reason-
ing; and it presently occurred to my thoughts that if such a
temper was universal, we might be all Catholic Christians, what-
ever church or particular profession we joined to, or joined in;
that a spirit of charity would soon work us all up into right
principles; and, in a word, as he thought that the like charity
would make us all Catholics, so I told him I believed had all
the members of his Church the like moderation, they would soon
be all Protestants; and there we left that part, for we never
disputed at all.
However, I talked to him another way; and taking him by
the hand, "My friend," says I, "I wish all the clergy of the
Romish Church were blessed with such moderation, and had an
equal share of your charity. I am entirely of your opinion;
but I must tell you, that if you should preach such doctrine in
Spain or Italy, they would put you into the Inquisition."
"It may be so," said he; "I know not what they might do
in Spain or Italy; but I will not say they would be the better
Christians for that severity, for I am sure there is no heresy in
too much charity."
Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our business
there was over, so we went back our own way, and when we
came back we found them waiting to be called in. Observing
this, I asked my clergyman if we should discover to him that
we had seen him under the bush, or no? and it was his opinion
we should not; but that we should talk to him first, and hear
what he would say to us. So we called him in alone, nobody
being in the place but ourselves; and I began with them thus:
"Will Atkins," said I, " prythee what education had you?
What was your father?"
W. A. A better man than ever I shall be. Sir, my father
was a clergyman.
R. C. What education did he give you?
W. A. He would have taught me well, sir; but I despised
all education, instruction, or correction, like a beast as I was.
R. C. It's true, Solomon says, " He that despises reproof is
brutish."
IV. A. Ay, sir, I was brutish indeed; I murdered my father;
for God's sake, sir, talk no more about that, sir; I murdered
my poor father.
Pr. Ha! a murderer!
[Here the priest started, for I interpreted every word as he
spoke it, and looked pale. It seems he believed that Will had
really killed his own father.]
R. C. No, no, sir; I do not understand him so. Will Atkins,
explain yourself. You did not kill your father, did you, with
your own hand?
W. A. No, sir, I did not cut his throat; but I cut the
thread of his comforts, and shortened his days; I broke his
heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural return for the most tender,
affectionate treatment that ever father gave, or child could
receive.
R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your father to extort
this confession; I pray God give you repentance for it, and
forgive you that and all your other sins; but I asked you because
I see that, though you have not much learning, yet you are not
so ignorant as some are in things that are good; that you have
known more of religion a great deal than you have practised.
W. A. Though you, sir, did not extort the confession that I
made about my father, conscience does; and whenever we
come to look back upon our lives, the sins against our indulgent
parents are certainly the first that touch us; the wounds they
make lie the deepest; and the weight they leave will lie heaviest
upon the mind of all the sins we can commit.
R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins; I
cannot bear it.
W. A. You bear it, master! I dare say you know nothing
of it.
R. C. Yes, Atkins, every shore, every hill, nay, I may say
every tree in this island, is witness to the anguish of my soul
for my ingratitude and base usage of a good tender father—a
father much like yours by your description; and I murdered
my father as well as you, Will Atkins; but I think for all that
my repentance is short of yours too, by a great deal.
I would have said more, if I could have restrained my
passions: but I thought this poor man's repentance was so
much sincerer than mine, that I was going to leave off the dis-
course and retire, for I was surprised with what he said, and
thought that, instead of my going about to teach and instruct
him, the man was a teacher and instructor to me, in a most
surprising and unexpected manner.
I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly
affected with it, and said to me, " Did I not say, sir, that when
this man was converted he would preach to us all? I tell you,
sir, if this one man be made a true penitent, here will be no
need of me; he will make Christians of all in the island." But
having a little composed myself, I renewed my discourse with
Will Atkins.
"But, Will," said I, "how comes the sense of this matter
to touch you just now?"
W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck a
dart through my very soul. I have been talking about God and
religion to my wife, in order, as you directed me, to make a
Christian of her; and she has preached such a sermon to me as
I shall never forget while I live.
R. C. No, no; it is not your wife has preached to you;
but when you were moving religious arguments to her, con-
science has flung them back upon you.
W. A. Ay, sir, with such a force as is not to be resisted.
R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed between you and
your wife, for I know something of it already.
W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full account of it.
I am too full to hold it, and yet have no tongue to express it;
but let her have said what she will, and though I cannot give
you an account of it, this I can tell you of it, that I resolve to
amend and reform my life.
R. C. But tell us some of it. How did you begin, Will? for
this has been an extraordinary case, that's certain; she has
preached a sermon indeed, if she has wrought this upon you.
W. A. Why, I first told her the nature of our laws about
marriage, and what the reasons were that men and women were
obliged to enter into such compacts as it was neither in the
power of one or other to break; that otherwise, order and
justice could not be maintained, and men would run from their
wives and abandon their children, mix confusedly with one
another, and neither families be kept entire, or inheritances be
settled by legal descent.
R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told her?
W. A. She said she liked it very well, and it was much
better than in her country.
R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was?
W. A. Ay, ay; there began all our dialogue. I asked her if
she would be married to me our way? She asked me what
way that was? I told her marriage was appointed by God;
and here we had a strange talk together indeed, as ever man
and wife had, I believe.
\N,B.—This dialogue between W. Atkins and his wife, as
I took it down in writing, just after he told it me, was as
follows.]
Wife. Appointed by your God! Why, have you a God in
your country?
W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country.
Wife. No you God in my country; my country have the
great old Benamuckee God.
W. A, Child, I am very unfit to show you who God is.
God is in heaven, and made the heaven and the earth, the sea,
and all that in them is.
Wife. No makee de earth; no you God make all earth, no
make my country.
[W. A. laughed a little at her expression of God not making
her country.]
Wife. No laugh; why laugh me? This no thing to laugh.
[He was justly reproved by his wife, for she was more
serious than he at first.]
W. A. That's true, indeed; I will not laugh any more, my
dear.
Wife. Why you say, you God make all?
W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole world, and you,
and me, and all things; for He is the only true God; there is
no God but Him; He lives for ever in heaven.
Wife. Why you no tell me long ago?
W. A. That's true, indeed; but I have been a wicked
wretch, and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with
anything before, but have lived without God in the world
myself.
Wife. What, have you de great God in you country, you no
know Him? No say O to Him? No do good thing for Him?
That no possible!
W. A. It is too true though, for all that; we live as if there
was no God in heaven, or that He had no power on earth.
Wife. But why God let you do so? Why He nomakeeyou
good live?
W. A. It is all our own fault.
Wife. But you say me He is great, much great, have much
great power; can makee kill when He will. Why He no
makee kill when you no serve Him, no say O to Him, no be
good mans?
W. A. That is true. He might strike me dead, and I ought
to expect it; for I have been a wicked wretch, that is true; but
God is merciful, and does not deal with us as we deserve.
Wife. But then, do not you tell God tankee for that too?
W. A. No, indeed; I have not thanked God for His mercy,
any more than I have feared God for His power.
Wife. Then you God no God; me no think, believe, He be
such one, great, much power, strong; no makee kill you,
though you makee Him much angry.
W. A. What! will my wicked life hinder you from believing
in God? What a dreadful creature am I; and what a sad
truth is it, that the horrid lives of Christians hinders the
conversion of heathens!
Wife. How me tink you have great much God [she points
up to heaven] up there and yet no do well, no do good thing?
Can He tell? Sure He no tell what you do?
W. A. Yes, yes, He knows and sees all things; He hears us
speak, sees what we do, knows what we think, though we do
not speak.
Wife. What! He no hear you swear, curse, speak the great
damn?
W. A. Yes, yes, He hears it all.
Wife. Where be then the muchee great power strong?
W. A. He is merciful, that's all we can say for it? and this
z
proves Him to be the true God. He is God, and not man;
and therefore we are not consumed.
[Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with horror to
think how he could tell his wife so clearly that God sees, and
hears, and knows the secret thoughts of the heart, and all that
we do, and yet that he had dared to do all the vile things he
had done.]
Wife. Merciful! what you call that?
W. A. He is our Father and Maker, and He pities and
spares us.
Wife. So then He never makee kill, never angry when you
do wicked; then He no good Himself, or no great able.
W. A, Yes, yes, my dear; He is infinitely good, and in-
finitely great, and able to punish too; and sometimes, to show
His justice and vengeance, He lets fly His anger to destroy
sinners, and make examples; many are cut off in their sins.
Wife. But no make kill you yet; then He tell you, may be,
that He no make you kill, so you make de bargain with Him,
you do bad thing, He no be angry at you, when He be angry at
other mans?
W. A. No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions upon His
goodness; and He would be infinitely just if He destroyed me,
as He has done other men.
Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead; what you
say to Him for that? You no tell Him tankee for all that
too?
W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that's true.
Wife. Why He no makee you much good better? You say
He makee you.
W. A. He made me as He made all the world; 'tis I have
deformed myself, and abused His goodness, and made myself an
abominable wretch.
Wife. I wish you makee God know me; I no makee Him
angry; I no do bad wicked thing.
[Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him to hear a
poor, untaught creature desire to be taught to know God, and he
such a wicked wretch that he could not say one word to her
about God but what the reproach of his own carriage would
make most irrational to her to believe; nay, that already she
had told him that she could not believe in God, because he that
was so wicked was not destroyed.]
W. A. My dear, you mean you wish I could teach you to
know God, not God to know you? for He knows you already,
and every thought in your heart.
Wife. Why then He know what I say to you now? He know
me wish to know Him; how shall me know who makee me?
W. A. Poor creature, He must teach thee, I cannot teach
thee; I'll pray to Him to teach thee to know Him, and to forgive
me that I am unworthy to teach thee.
[N.B.—This was the time when we saw him kneel down and
lift up his hands.]
Wife. What you put down the knee for? What you hold up
the hand for? What you say? Who you speak to? What is
all that?
W. A. My dear, I bow my knees in token of my submission
to Him that made me; I said O to Him, as you call it, and as
you say your old men do to their idol Benamuckee; that is, I
prayed to Him.
Wife. What you say O to Him for?
W. A. I prayed to Him to open your eyes and your under-
standing, that you may know Him, and be accepted by Him.
Wife. Can He do that too?
W. A. Yes, He can; He can do all things.
Wife. But now He hear what you say?
W. A. Yes; He has bid us pray to Him, and promised to
hear us.
Wife. Bid you pray? When He bid you? How He bid you?
What, you hear Him speak?
W. A. No, we do not hear Him speak; but He has revealed
Himself many ways to us.
[Here he was at a great loss to make her understand that
God has revealed Himself to us by His Word; and what His
Word was; but at last he told it her thus.]
W. A. God has spoken to some good men in former days,
even from heaven, by plain words; and God has inspired good
men by His Spirit, and they have written all His laws down in
a book.
Wife. Me no understand that; where is book?
W. A. Alas, my poor creature, I have not this book! but I
hope I shall, one time or other, get it for you, and help you to
read it.
[Here he embraced her with great affection; but with inex-
pressible grief that he had not a Bible.]
Wife. But how you makee me know that God teachee them
to write that book?
W. A. By the same rule that we know Him to be God.
Wife. What rule? what way you know Him?
W. A. Because He teaches and commands nothing but what
is good, righteous, and holy, and tends to make us perfectly
good, as well as perfectly happy; and because He forbids, and
commands us to avoid, all that is wicked, that is evil in itself, or
evil in its consequences.
Wife. That me would understand, that me fain see; if He
teachee all good thing, forbid all wicked thing, He reward all
good thing, punish all wicked thing, He make all thing, He give
all thing; He hear me when I say O to Him, as you go do just
now; He makee me good if I wish to be good; He spare me,
no makee kill me when I no be good; all this you say He do;
yet He be great God; me take, think, believe Him be great God;
me say O to Him too with you, my dear.
Here the poor man could forbear no longer; but raising her
up, made her kneel by him; and he prayed to God aloud to
instruct her in the knowledge of Himself by His Spirit; and
that by some good providence, if possible, she might some time
or other come to have a Bible, that she might read the Word of
God, and be taught by it to know Him.
This was the time that we saw him lift her up by the hand,
and saw him kneel down by her as above.
They had several other discourses, it seems, after this, too long
to set down here; and particularly she made him promise, that
since he confessed his own life had been a wicked abominable
course of provocation against God, that he would reform it, and
not make God angry any more, lest he should make him dead,
as she called it, and then she should be left alone, and never be
taught to know this God better; and lest he should be
miserable, as he had told her wicked men should be after
death.
This was a strange account, and very affecting to us both,
but particularly to the young clergyman. He was indeed
wonderfully surprised with it, but under the greatest affliction
imaginable that he could not talk to her; that he could not
speak English to make her understand him, and as she spoke
but very broken English, he could not understand her. How-
ever, he turned himself to me, and told me that he believed
there must be more to do with this woman than to marry her.
I did not understand him at first, but at length he explained
himself, viz., that she ought to be baptized.
When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated him that
he would perform that office with some caution, that the man
might not perceive he was of the Roman Church, if possible,
because of other ill consequences which might attend a
difference among us in that very religion which we were
instructing the other in. He told me that as he had no con-
secrated chapel, no proper things for the office, I should see he
would do it in a manner that I should not know by it that he
was a Roman Catholic myself if I had not known it before.
And so he did; for saying only some words over to himself in
Latin, which I could not understand, he poured a whole dishful
of water upon the woman's head, pronouncing in French very
loud, " Mary,"—which was the name her husband desired me to
give her, for I was her godfather—" I baptize thee in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost" ; so that
none could know anything by it what religion he was of. He
gave the benediction afterwards in Latin ; but either Will Atkins
did not know but it was in French, or else did not take notice
of it at that time.
As soon as this was over, we married them; and after the
marriage was over, he turned himself to Will Atkins, and in a
very affectionate manner exhorted him not only to persevere in
that good disposition he was in, but to support the convictions
that were upon him by a resolution to reform his life; told him
it was in vain to say he repented if he did not forsake his
crimes; represented to him how God had honoured him with
being the instrument of bringing his wife to the knowledge of
the Christian religion, and that he should be careful he did not
dishonour the grace of God; and that if he did, he would see the
heathen a better Christian than himself; the savage converted,
and the instrument cast away.
He said a great many good things to them both, and then
recommending them, in a few words, to God's goodness, gave
them the benediction again, I repeating everything to them in
English, and thus ended the ceremony. I think it was the
most pleasant, agreeable day to me that ever I passed in my
whole life.
But my clergyman had not done yet. His thoughts hung
continually upon the conversion of the seven and thirty
savages, and fain he would have stayed upon the island to have
undertaken it; but I convinced him, first, that his undertaking
was impracticable in itself; and secondly, that, perhaps, I would
put it into a way of being done, in his absence, to his satis-
faction; of which by-and-by.
Having thus brought the affair of the island to a narrow
compass, I was preparing to go on board the ship when the
young man, whom I had taken out of the famished ship's
company, came to me, and told me he understood I had a
clergyman with me, and that I caused the Englishmen to be
married to the savages whom they called wives; that he had a
match too which he desired might be finished before I went,
between two Christians, which he hoped would not be disagree-
able to me.
I knew this must be the young woman who was his mother's
servant, for there was no other Christian woman on the island.
So I began to persuade him not to do anything of that kind
rashly, or because he found himself in this solitary circumstance.
I represented to him that he had some considerable substance
in the world, and good friends, as I understood by himself, and
by his maid also; that his maid was not only poor, and a
servant, but was unequal to him, she being six or seven and
twenty years old, and he not above seventeen or eighteen; that
he might very probably, with my assistance, make a remove
from this wilderness, and come into his own country again,
and that then it would be a thousand to one but he would
repent his choice, and the dislike of that circumstance might be
disadvantageous to both. I was going to say more, but he
interrupted me, smiling, and told me, with a great deal of
modesty, that I mistook in my guesses; that he had nothing
of that kind in his thoughts, his present circumstance being
melancholy and disconsolate enough; and he was very glad to
hear that I had thoughts of putting them in a way to see their
country again ; and nothing should have put him upon staying
there but that the voyage I was going was so exceeding long
and hazardous, and would carry him quite out of the reach of
all his friends; that he had nothing to desire of me but that I
would settle him in some little property in the island where he
was, give him a servant or two, and some few necessaries, and
he would settle himself here like a planter, waiting the good
time when, if ever I returned to England, I would redeem him,
and hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I came into
England; that he would give me some letters to his friends in
London, to let them know how good I had been to him, and in
what part of the world, and what circumstance I had left him
in; that he promised me that whenever I redeemed him, the
plantation, and all the improvement he had made upon it, let
the value be what it would, should be wholly mine.
His discourse was very prettily delivered considering his
youth, and was the more agreeable to me because he told me
positively the match was not for himself. I gave him all
possible assurances that, if I lived to come safe to England, I
would deliver his letters, and do his business effectually, and
that he might depend I would never forget the circumstance I
had left him in. But still I was impatient to know who were
the persons to be married; upon which he told me it was my
Jack-of-all-trades and his maid Susan.
I was most agreeably surprised when he named the match,
for indeed I thought it very suitable. The character of that
man I have given already; and as for the maid, she was a very
honest, modest, sober, and religious young woman; had a very
good share of sense; was agreeable enough in her person;
spoke very handsomely, and to the purpose; always with
decency and good manners, and not backward to speak when
anything required it, or impertinently forward to speak when
it was not her business; very handy and housewifely in any-
thing that was before her; an excellent manager, and fit
indeed to have been governess to the whole island. She knew

We MARRIED THEM THE SAME DAY.
very well how to behave to all kind of folks she had about her,
and to better if she had found any there.
The match being proposed in this manner, we married them
the same day; and as I was father at the altar, as I may say,
and gave her away, so I gave her a portion, for I appointed
her and her husband a handsome large space of ground for
their plantation; and indeed this match, and the proposal the
young gentleman made, to give him a small property in the
island, put me upon parcelling it out amongst them, that they
might not quarrel afterwards about their situation.
This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins,
who indeed was now grown a most sober, grave, managing
fellow, perfectly reformed, exceeding pious and religious, and
as far as I may be allowed to speak positively in such a case,
I verily believe was a true sincere penitent.
He divided things so justly, and so much to every one's
satisfaction, that they only desired one general writing under
my hand for the whole, which I caused to be drawn up and
signed and sealed to them, setting out the bounds and situation
of every man's plantation, and testifying that I gave them
thereby, severally, a right to the whole possession and inherit-
ance of the respective plantations or farms, with their improve-
ments, to them and their heirs; reserving all the rest of the
island as my own property, and a certain rent for every
particular plantation after eleven years, if I or anyone from me,
or in my name, came to demand it, producing an attested copy
of the same writing.
As to the government and laws among them, I told them I
was not capable of giving them better rules than they were
able to give themselves; only made them promise me to live
in love and good neighbourhood with one another; and so I
prepared to leave them.
One thing I must not omit, and this is, that being now
settled in a kind of commonwealth among themselves, and
having much business in hand, it was but odd to have seven
and thirty Indians live in a nook of the island, independent,
and indeed unemployed; for excepting the providing them-
selves food, which they had difficulty enough in too, sometimes,
they had no manner of business or property to manage. I
proposed therefore to the governor Spaniard that he should go
to them with Friday's father, and propose to them to remove,
and either plant for themselves, or take them into their several
families as servants, to be maintained for their labour, but
without being absolute slaves; for I would not admit them to
make them slaves by force by any means, because they had
their liberty given them by capitulation, and as it were, articles
of surrender, which they ought not to break.
They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came all
very cheerfully along with him ; so we allotted them land and
plantations, which three or four accepted of, but all the rest
chose to be employed as servants in the several families we had
settled; and thus my colony was in a manner settled as
follows :—The Spaniards possessed my original habitation,
which was the capital city, and extended their plantations all
along the side of the brook, which made the creek that I have
so often described, as far as my bower; and as they increased
their culture, it went always eastward. The English lived in
the north-east part, where Will Atkins and his comrades began,
and came on southward and south-west, towards the back
part of the Spaniards; and every plantation had a great
addition of land to take in if they found occasion, so that they
need not jostle one another for want of room.
All the east end of the island was left uninhabited, that if
any of the savages should come on shore there, only for their
usual customary barbarities, they might come and go; if
they disturbed nobody, nobody would disturb them; and no
doubt but they were often ashore and went away again, for I
never heard that the planters were attacked or disturbed any
more.
It now came into my thoughts that I had hinted to my
friend the clergyman that the work of converting the savages
might perhaps be set on foot in his absence to his satisfaction;
and I told him that now I thought it was put in a fair way,
for the savages being thus divided among the Christians, if
they would but every one of them do their part with those
which came under their hands, I hoped it might have a very
good effect.
He agreed presently in that. "If," said he, "they will do
their part; but how," says he, " shall we obtain that of them?"
I told him we would call them together, and leave it in charge
with them, or go to them one by one, which he thought best.
So we divided it—he to speak to the Spaniards, who were all
Papists, and I to the English, who were all Protestants; and
we recommended it earnestly to them, and made them
promise that they never would make any distinction of Papist
or Protestant in their exhorting the savages to turn
Christians, but teach them the general knowledge of the true
God, and of their Saviour Jesus Christ; and they likewise
promised us that they would never have any differences
or disputes one with another about religion.
When I came to Will Atkins's house—I may call it so, for
such a house, or such a piece of basket-work, I believe was not
standing in the world again; I say when I came there, I found
the young woman I have mentioned above and Will Atkins's
wife were become intimates; and this prudent, religious
young woman had perfected the work Will Atkins had begun;
and though it was not above four days after what I have
related, yet the new-baptized savage woman was made such
a Christian as I have seldom heard of any like her in all my
observation or conversation in the world.
It came next into my mind in the morning, before I went to
them, that amongst all the needful things I had to leave with
them, I had not left them a Bible; in which I showed myself
less considering for them than my good friend the widow was
for me, when she sent me the cargo of a hundred pounds from
Lisbon, where she packed up three Bibles and a prayer-book.
However, the good woman's charity had a greater extent than
ever she imagined, for they were reserved for the comfort
and instruction of those that made much better use of them
than I had done.
I took one of the Bibles in my pocket; and when I came to
Will Atkins's tent, or house, and found the young woman and
Atkins's baptized wife had been discoursing of religion together
—for Will Atkins told it me with a great deal of joy—I asked
if they were together now, and he said yes. So I went into
the house, and he with me, and we found them together, very
earnest in discourse. The young woman blushed, and rose up
to go away, but I desired her to sit still. I told her she had a
good work upon her hands, and I hoped God would bless her
in it.
We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had any
book among them, though I did not ask; but I put my hand
in my pocket and pulled out my Bible. "Here," says I to
Atkins, " I have brought you an assistant that perhaps you had
not before."
Sure no man was ever more thankful in the world for any-
thing of its kind than he was for his Bible; nor, I believe, never
any man was glad of a Bible from a better principle. And
though he had been a most profligate creature, desperate, head-
strong, outrageous, furious, and wicked to a great degree, yet
this man is a standing rule to us all for the well instructing
children, viz., that parents should never give over to teach and
instruct, or ever despair of the success of their endeavours, let
the children be ever so obstinate, refractory, or to appearance
insensible of instruction; for if ever God in His providence
touches the consciences of such, the force of their education
returns upon them, and the early instruction of parents is not
lost, though it may have been many years laid asleep, but some
time or other they may find the benefit of it.
The young woman was very glad of it also for the present
occasion, though she had one, and so had the youth, on board
our ship among their goods, which were not yet brought on
shore. And now, having said so many things of this young
woman, I cannot omit telling one story more of her and myself,
which has something in it very informing and remarkable.
I have related to what extremity the poor young woman
was reduced; how her mistress was starved to death, and did
die on board that unhappy ship we met at sea; and how the
whole ship's company being reduced to the last extremity, the
gentlewoman and her son, and this maid, were first hardly used
as to provisions, and at last totally neglected and starved ; that
is to say, brought to the last extremity of hunger.
One day being discoursing with her upon the extremities
they suffered, I asked her if she could describe by what she had
felt what it was to starve, and how it appeared! She told me she
believed she could, and she told her tale very distinctly thus:—
"First, sir," said she, "we had for some days fared
exceeding hard, and suffered very great hunger, but now at
last we were wholly without food of any kind except sugar, and
a little wine, and a little water. The first day after I had
received no food at all, I found myself towards evening first
empty and sickish at my stomach, and nearer night mightily
inclined to yawning, and sleepy. I laid down on a couch in
the great cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, and
awaked a little refreshed, having taken a glass of wine when I
lay down. After being about three hours awake, it being about
fiveo'clock in the morning, I found myself empty, and mystomach
sickish, and laid down again, but could not sleep at all, being
very faint and ill; and thus I continued all the second day,
with a strange variety—first hungry, then sick again, with
Teachings to vomit. The second night, being obliged to go to
bed again without any food more than a draught of fair water,
and being asleep, I dreamed I was at Barbadoes, and that the
market was mightily stocked with provisions, that I bought
some for my mistress, and went and dined very heartily.
"I thought my stomach was as full after this as any would
have been after or at a good dinner; but when I waked, I was
exceedingly sunk in my spirits to find myself in the extremity
of famine. The last glass of wine we had I drank, and put
sugar in it, because of its having some spirit to supply nourish-
ment; but there being no substance in the stomach for the
digesting office to work upon, I found the only effect of the
wine was to raise disagreeable fumes from the stomach into the
head; and I lay, as they told me, stupid and senseless, as one
drunk, for some time.
"The third day, in the morning, after a night of strange and
confused inconsistent dreams, and rather dozing than sleeping,
I waked, ravenous and furious with hunger; and I question,
had not my understanding returned and conquered it, I say, I
question whether, if I had been a mother, and had had a little
child with me, its life would have been safe or not. This lasted
about three hours, during which time I was twice raging mad
as any creature in Bedlam, as my young master told me, and
as he can now inform you.
"In one of these fits of lunacy or distraction, whether by
the motion of the ship or some slip of my foot I know not, I
fell down, and struck my face against the corner of a pallet bed,
in which my mistress lay, and with the blow the blood gushed
out of my nose, and the cabin-boy bringing me a little basin, I
sat down and bled into it a great deal, and as the blood ran
from me I came to myself, and the violence of the flame or the
fever I was in abated, and so did the ravenous part of the
hunger.
"Then I grew sick and reached to vomit, but could not, for,
I had nothing in my stomach to bring up. After I had bled
some time I swooned, and they all believed I was dead; but I
came to myself soon after, and then had a most dreadful pain
in my stomach, not to be described, not like the colic, but a
gnawing, eager pain for food; and towards night it went off
with a kind of earnest wishing or longing for food, something
like, as I suppose, the longing of a woman with child. I took
another draught of water with sugar in it, but my stomach
loathed the sugar, and brought it all up again; then I took
a draught of water without sugar, and that stayed with me, and
I laid me down upon the bed, praying most heartily that it
would please God to take me away; and composing my mind
in hopes of it, I slumbered awhile; and then waking, thought
myself dying, being light with vapours from an empty
stomach. I recommended my soul then to God, and earnestly
wished that somebody would throw me into the sea.
"All this while my mistress lay by me just, as I thought,
expiring, but bore it with much more patience than I, and gave
the last bit of bread she had left to her child, my young master,
who would not have taken it, but she obliged him to eat it;
and I believe it saved his life.
"Towards the morning I slept again, and first when I awaked
I fell into a violent passion of crying, and after that had a
second fit of violent hunger. I got up ravenous, and in a most
dreadful condition. Had my mistress been dead, as much as I
loved her I am certain I should have eaten a piece of her flesh
with as much relish, and as unconcerned, as ever I did the flesh
of any creature appointed for food; and once or twice I was
going to bite my own arm. At last I saw the basin in
which was the blood I had bled at my nose the day before. I ran
to it, and swallowed it with such haste, and such a greedy appetite,
as if I had wondered nobody had taken it before, and afraid it
would be taken from me now.
"Though after it was down the thoughts of it filled me with
horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger, and I drank a draught
of fair water, and was composed and refreshed for some hours
after it. This was the fourth day; and thus I held it till towards
night, when, within the compass of three hours, I had all these
several circumstances over again, one after another, viz., sick,
sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain in the stomach, then ravenous
again, then sick again, then lunatic, then crying, then ravenous
again, and so every quarter of an hour; and my strength wasted
exceedingly. At night I laid me down, having no comfort but
in the hope that I should die before morning.
"All this night I had no sleep; but the hunger was now
turned into a disease, and I had a terrible colic and griping, by
wind instead of food having found its way into the bowels;
and in this condition I lay till morning, when I was surprised a
little with the cries and lamentations of my young master, who
called out to me that his mother was dead. I lifted myself up
a little, for I had not strength to rise, but found she was not
dead, though she was able to give very little signs of life.
"I had then such convulsions in my stomach for want of
some sustenance, that I cannot describe, with such frequent
throes and pangs of appetite that nothing but the tortures of
death can imitate; aud in this condition I was when I heard the
seamen above cry out' A sail! a sail!' and halloo and jump
about as if they were distracted.
"I was not able to get off from the bed, and my mistress
much less, and my young master was so sick that I thought he
had been expiring; so we could not open the cabin-door, or get
any account what it was that occasioned such a combustion;
nor had we had any conversation with the ship's company for
two days, they having told us that they had not a mouthful of
anything to eat in the ship; and they told us afterwards they
thought we had been dead.
"It was this dreadful condition we were in when you were
sent to save our lives; and how you found us, sir, you know as
well as I, and better too."
This was her own relation, and is such a distinct account of
starving to death as I confess I never met with, and was
exceeding entertaining to me. I am the rather apt to believe it
to be a true account, because the youth gave me an account of
a good part of it; though I must own not so distinct and so
feelingly as his maid, and the rather because it seems his
mother fed him at the price of her own life; but the poor maid,
though her constitution being stronger than that of her mistress,
who was in years, and a weakly woman too, she might struggle
harder with it; I say, the poor maid might be supposed to feel
the extremity something sooner than her mistress, who might
be allowed to keep the last bit something longer than she
parted with any to relieve the maid. No question, as the case
is here related, if our ship, or some other, had not so provi-
dentially met them, a few days more would have ended all
their lives, unless they had prevented it by eating one another;
and even that, as their case stood, would have served them but
a little while, they being five hundred leagues from any land,
or any possibility of relief, other than in the miraculous
manner it happened. But this is by the way; I return to my
disposition of things among the people.
And first, it is to be observed here, that for many reasons I
did not think fit to let them know anything of the sloop I had
framed, and which I thought of setting up among them; for I
found, at least at my first coming, such seeds of divisions among
them, that I saw it plainly had I set up the sloop, and left it
among them, they would, upon every light disgust, have
separated, and gone away from one another; or perhaps have
turned pirates, and so made the island a den of thieves, instead
of a plantation of sober and religious people, so as I intended
it; nor did I leave the two pieces of brass cannon that I had
on board, or the two quarter-deck guns that my nephew took
extraordinarily, for the same reason. I thought it was enough
to qualify them for a defensive war against any that should
invade them, but not to set them up for an offensive war, or to
encourage them to go abroad to attack others, which, in the
end, would only bring ruin and destruction upon themselves and
all their undertaking. I reserved the sloop, therefore, and the
guns for their service another way, as I shall observe in its place.
I have now done with the island. I left them all in good cir-
cumstances, and in a flourishing condition, and went on board
my ship again the [fifth day] of [May], having been five and
twenty days among them; and as they were all resolved to stay
upon the island till I came to remove them, I promised to send
some farther relief from the Brazils, if I could possibly find an
opportunity; and particularly, I promised to send them some
cattle, such as sheep, hogs, and cows; for as to the two cows
and calves which I brought from England, we had been obliged,
by the length of our voyage, to kill them at sea for want of hay
to feed them.
The next day, giving them a salute of five guns at parting,
we set sail, and arrived at the Bay of All Saints, in the
Brazils, in about twenty-two days, meeting nothing remarkable
in our passage but this, that about three days after we sailed,
being becalmed, and the current setting strong to the E.N.E.,
running, as it were, into a bay or gulf on the land side, we were
driven something out of our course; and once or twice our
men cried land to the eastward; but whether it was the
continent, or islands, we could not tell by any means.
But the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth and the
weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were covered towards the
land with something very black; not being able to discover
what it was till, after some time, our chief mate going up the
main shrouds a little way, and looking at them with a per-
spective, cried out it was an army. I could not imagine what
he meant by an army, and spoke a little hastily, calling the
fellow a fool, or some such word. "Nay, sir," says he, "don't
be angry, for 'tis an army, and a fleet too; for I believe there
are a thousand canoes, and you may see them paddle along, and
they are coming towards us too, apace."
I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my nephew,
the captain; for he had heard such terrible stories of them in
the island, and having never been in those seas before, that he
could not tell what to think of it, but said two or three times we
should all be devoured. I must confess, considering we were
becalmed, and the current set strong towards the shore, I liked
it the worst. However, I bade him not be afraid, but bring the
ship to an anchor as soon as we came so near to know that we
must engage them.
The weather continued calm, and they came on apace towards
us; so I gave order to come to an anchor, and furl all our sails.
As for the savages, I told them they had nothing to fear but
fire; and therefore they should get their boats out, and fasten
them, one close by the head, and the other by the stern, and
man them both well, and wait the issue in that posture. This
I did, that the men in the boats might be ready, with skeetsand
buckets, to put out any fire these savages might endeavour to
fix to the outside of the ship. In this posture we lay by for them,
and in a little while they came up with us; but never was such
a horrid sight seen by Christians. My mate was much mistaken
in his calculation of their number, I mean of a thousand
canoes, the most we could make of them when they came up
being about a hundred and six and twenty; and a great many
of them too; for some of them had sixteen or seventeen men in
them, and some more, and the least six or seven,
2A
When they came nearer to us they seemed to be struck with
wonder and astonishment, as at a sight which they had, doubtless,
never seen before; nor could they at first, as we afterwards under-
stood, know what to make of us. They came boldly up, however,
very near to us, and seemed to go about to row round us; but
we called to our men in the boats not to let them come too near
them.
This very order brought us to an engagement with them,
without our designing it; for five or six of their large canoes
came so near our longboat, that our men beckoned with their
hands to them to keep back, which they understood very well,
and went back; but at their retreat about fifty arrows came on
board us from those boats, and one of our men in the longboat
was very much wounded.
However, I called to them not to fire by any means; but we
handed down some deal boards into the boat, and the carpenters
presently set up a kind of fence, like waist boards, to cover them
from the arrows of the savages, if they should shoot again.
About half-an-hour afterwards they came all up in a body
astern of us, and pretty near us, so near that we could easily
discern what they were, though we could not tell their design;
and I easily found they were some of my old friends, the same
sort of savages that I had been used to engage with; and in a
little time more they rowed a little farther out to sea, till they
came directly broadside with us, and then rowed down straight
upon us, till they came so near, that they could hear us speak.
Upon this I ordered all my men to keep close, lest they should
shoot anymore arrows, and made all our guns ready; but being
so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go out upon the
deck and call out aloud to them in his language to know what
they meant, which accordingly he did. Whether they under-
stood him or not, that I knew not; but as soon as he had called
to them, six of them, who were in the foremost or nighest boat
to us, turned their canoes from us, and stooping down, showed
us their bare-naked backs. Whether this was a defiance or
challenge, we know not; or whether it was done in mere con-
tempt, or as a signal to the rest; but immediately Friday cried
out they were going to shoot; and unhappily for him, poor fellow,
they let fly about three hundred of their arrows, and to my in-
THEV I-ET FLV , . . THEIR ARROWS AND K ILL ED POOR FRIDAY.
expressible grief killed poor Friday, no other man being in their
sight. The poor fellow was shot with no less than three arrows,
and about three more fell very near him: such unlucky marks-
men they were.
I was so enraged with the loss of my old servant, the com-
panion of all my sorrows and solitudes, that I immediately
ordered five guns to be loaded with small shot, and four with
great, and gave them such a broadside as they had never heard
in their lives before, to be sure. They were not above half a
cable length off when we fired; and our gunners took their aim
so well, that three or four of their canoes were overset, as we
had reason to believe, by one shot only.
I can neither tell how many we killed, or how many we
wounded,at this broadside; but sure such a fright and hurry never
was seen among such a multitude. There were thirteen or
fourteen of their canoes split and overset, in all, and the men
all set a-swimming; the rest, frighted out of their wits, scoured
away as fast as they could, taking but little care to save those
whose boats were split or spoiled with our shot. So I suppose
that they were many of them lost; and our men took one poor
fellow swimming for his life above an hour after they were all
gone.
Our small shot from our cannon must needs kill and wound
a great many; but, in short, we never knew anything how it
went with them; for they fled so fast, that in three hours, or
thereabouts, we could not see above three or four straggling
canoes; nor did we ever see the rest any more; for a breeze of
wind springing up the same evening, we weighed and set sail
for the Brazils.
We had a prisoner indeed, but the creature was so sullen,
that he would neither eat or speak; and we all fancied he would
starve himself to death. But I took a way to cure him; for 1
made them take him and turn him into the longboat, and made
him believe they would toss him into the sea again, and so leave
him where they found him if he would not speak. Nor would
that do; but they really did throw him into the sea, and came
away from him; and then he followed them, for he swam like
a cork, and called to them in his tongue, though they knew not
one word of what he said. However, at last they took him in
N
"GAVE THEM. SUCH A BROADSIDE
again, and then he began to be more tractable; nor did I ever
design they should drown him.
We were now under sail again; but I was the most discon-
solate creature alive, for want of my man Friday, and would
have been very glad to have gone back to the island to have
taken one of the rest from thence for my occasion, but it could
not be; so we went on. We had one prisoner, as I have said;
and 'twas a long while before we could make him understand
anything; but in time our men taught him some English, and
he began to be a little tractable. Afterwards we inquired what
country he came from, but could make nothing of what he said;
for his speech was so odd, all gutturals, and spoke in the throat
in such a hollow odd manner, that we could never form a word
from him; and we were all of opinion that they might speak
that language as well if they were gagged as otherwise; nor
could we perceive that they had any occasion either for teeth,
tongue, lips, or palate, but formed their words just as a hunting-
horn forms a tune with an open throat. He told us, however,
sometime after, when we taught him to speak a little English,
that they were going, with their kings, to fight a great battle.
When he said kings, we asked him how many kings? He said
they were five nation (we could not make him understand the
plural j), and that they all joined to go against two nation. We
asked him what made them come up to us? He said, "To
makee to great wonder look." Where it is to be observed, that
all those natives, as also those of Africa, when they learn
English, they always add two e's at the end of the words where
we use one, and make the accent upon them, as make&, take^ and
the like; and we could not break them off it; nay, I could
hardly make Friday leave it off, though at last he did.
And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must take my
last leave of him, poor honest Friday! We buried him with all
the decency and solemnity possible, by putting him into a
coffin, and throwing him into the sea; and I caused them to
fire eleven guns for him; and so ended the life of the most
grateful, faithful, honest, and most affectionate servant that
ever man had.
We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil, and made
Cape St. Augustine, and in three days came to an anchor off of
the Bay of All Saints, the old place of my deliverance, from
whence came both my good and evil fate.
Never ship came to this part that had less business than I
had, and yet it was with great difficulty that we were admitted
to hold the least correspondence on shore. Not my planter
himself, who was alive, and made a great figure among them,
not my two merchant trustees, not the fame of my wonderful
preservation in that island, could obtain me that favour; but
my partner remembering that I had given five hundred moidores
to the prior of the monastery of the Augustines, and two
hundred and seventy-two to the poor, went to the monastery,
and obliged the prior that then was to go to the governor and
get leave for me personally, with the captain and one more,
besides eight seamen, to come on shore, and no more; and this
upon condition absolutely capitulated for, that we should not
offer to land any goods out of the ship, or to carry any person
away without licence.
They were so strict with us as to landing any goods, that it
was with extreme difficulty that I got on shore three bales of
English goods, such as fine broadcloths, stuffs, and some linen,
which I had brought for a present to my partner.
He was a very generous, broad-hearted man, though, like
me, he came from little at first; and though he knew not that I
had the least design of giving him anything, he sent me on
board a present of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth
above thirty moidores, including some tobacco, and three or
four fine medals in gold. But I was even with him in my
present, which, as I have said, consisted of fine broadcloth,
English stuffs, lace, and fine hollands. Also I delivered him
about the value of £ too sterling, in the same goods, for other
uses; and I obliged him to set up the sloop which I had brought
with me from England, as I have said, for the use of my colony,
in order to send the refreshments I intended to my plantation.
Accordingly he got hands, and finished the sloop in a very
few days, for she was ready framed; and I gave the master of
her such instructions as he could not miss the place; nor did he
miss them, as I had an account from my partner afterwards.
I got him soon loaded with the small cargo I sent them; and
one of our seamen, that had been on shore with me there,
offered to go with the sloop, and settle there, upon my letter to
the governor Spaniard, to allot him a sufficient quantity of
land for a plantation; and giving
him some clothes, and tools for his
planting work, which he said he
understood, having been an old
planter at Maryland, and a bucca-
neer into the bargain.
I encouraged the fellow by
granting all he desired; and as
an addition, I gave him the savage
which we had taken prisoner of
war to be his slave, and ordered the
governor Spaniard to give him his
share of everything he wanted, with
the rest.
When we came to fit this man
out, my old partner told me there
was a certain very honest fellow,
a Brazil planter of his acquaint-
ance, who had fallen into the dis-
pleasure of the Church. "I know
not what the matter is with him,"
says he, "but, on my conscience,
I think he is a heretic in his heart,
and he has been obliged to conceal
himself for fear of the Inquisition";
that he would be very glad of such
an opportunity to make his escape
with his wife and two daughters;
and if I would let them go to
the island, and allot them a planta-
tion, he would give them a small stock to begin with; for the
officers of the Inquisition had seized all his effects and estate,
and he had nothing left but a little household stuff, and two
slaves. "And," adds he, "though I hate his principles, yet I
would not have him fall into their hands, for he would
assuredly be burnt alive if he does."
I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with

A BUCCANEER INTO THE BARGAIN.
them; and we concealed the man and his wife and daughters
on board our ship, till the sloop put out to go to sea; and
then, having put all their goods on board the sloop some time
before, we put them on board the sloop after he was got out of
the bay.
Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new partner;
and their stock, indeed, was much alike, rich in tools, in prepara-
tions, and a farm ; but nothing to begin with, but as above.
However, they carried over with them, which was worth all the
rest, some materials for planting sugar-canes, with some plants
of canes; which he, I mean the Portugal man, understood very
well.
Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants in the
island, I sent them by their sloop three milch cows and five
calves, about twenty-two hogs, and three horses.
For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I engaged
three Portugal women to go; and recommended it to them to
marry them, and use them kindly. I could have procured more
women, but I remembered that the poor persecuted man had
two daughters, and there was but five of the Spaniards that
wanted; the rest had wives of their own, though in another
country.
All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily suppose,
very welcome to my old inhabitants, who were now, with this
addition, between sixty and seventy people, besides little
children, of which there was a great many. I found letters at
London from them all, by the way of Lisbon, when I came
back to England, of which I shall also take some notice imme-
diately.
I have now done with my island, and all manner of discourse
about it; and whoever reads the rest of my memorandums,
would do well to turn his thoughts entirely from it, and expect
to read of the follies of an old man, not warned by his own
harms, much less by those of other men, to beware of the like;
not cooled by almost forty years' misery and disappointments,
not satisfied with prosperity beyond expectation, not made
cautious by affliction and distress beyond imitation.
I had no more business to go to the East Indies than a
man at full liberty, and having committed no crime, has to go
to the turnkey at Newgate and desire him to lock him up
among the prisoners there and starve him. Had I taken a
small vessel from England, and went directly to the island;
had I loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with all the neces-
saries for the plantation, and for my people; took a patent from
the governor here to have secured my property, in subjection
only to that of England; had I carried over cannon and
ammunition, servants and people, to plant, and taking posses-
sion of the place, fortified and strengthened it in the name of
England, and increased it with people, as I might easily have
done; had I then settled myself there, and sent the ship back
loaden with good rice, as I might also have done in six months'
time, and ordered my friends to have fitted her out again for
our supply; had I done this, and stayed there myself, I had at
least acted like a man of common-sense. But I was possessed
with a wandering spirit, scorned all advantages; I pleased
myself with being the patron of those people I placed there,
and doing for them in a kind of haughty majestic way, like an
old patriarchal monarch; providing for them, as if I had been
father of the whole family, as well as of the plantation. But I
never so much as pretended to plant in the name of any
government or nation, or to acknowledge any prince, or to call
my people subjects to any one nation more than another; nay,
I never so much as gave the place a name, but left it as I found
it, belonging to no man, and the people under no discipline or
government but my own, who, though I had influence over
them as father and benefactor, had no authority or power to
act or command one way or other, farther than voluntary
consent moved them to comply. Yet even this, had I stayed
there, would have done well enough; but as I rambled from
them, and came there no more, the last letters I had from any
of them was by my partner's means, who afterwards sent
another sloop to the place, and who sent me word, though I
had not the letter till five years after it was written, that they
went on but poorly; were malcontent with their long stay
there; that Will Atkins was dead; that five of the Spaniards
were come away; and that though they had not been much
molested by the savages, yet they had had some skirmishes
with them; and that they begged of him to write to me to
think of the promise I had made to fetch them away, that they
might see their own country again before they died.
But I was gone a wild-goose chase indeed, and they that
will have any more of me must be content to follow me through
a new variety of follies, hardships, and wild adventures. 'Tis
no time now to enlarge any farther upon the reason or absurdity
of my own conduct; but to come to the history. I was em-
barked for the voyage, and the voyage I went.
I should only add here, that my honest and truly pious
clergyman left me here; a ship being ready to go to Lisbon, he
asked me leave to go thither, being still, as he observed, bound
never to finish any voyage he began. How happy had it been
for me if I had gone with him!
From the Brazils we made directly away over the Atlantic
sea to the Cape de Bonne Esperance, or, as we call it, the Cape
of Good Hope; and had a tolerable good voyage, our course
generally south-east; now and then a storm, and some contrary
winds. But my disasters at sea were at an end; my future rubs
and cross events were to befall me on shore, that it might
appear the land was as well prepared to be our scourge as the
sea, when Heaven, who directs the circumstances of things,
pleases to appoint it to be so.
Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo
on board, who was to direct all her motions after she arrived at
the Cape; only being limited to certain numbers of days for
stay, by charter-party, at the several ports she was to go to.
This was none of my business, neither did I meddle with it at
all; my nephew the captain and the supercargo adjusting all
those things between them as they thought fit.
We made no stay at the Cape longer than was needful to
take in fresh water, but made the best of our way for the coast
of Coromandel. We were indeed informed that a French man-
of-war of fifty guns and two large merchant ships were gone
for the Indies; and as I knew we were at war with France, I
had some apprehensions of them; but they went their way, and
we heard no more of them.
It is enough to name the ports and places which we touched
at, and what occurred to us upon our passing from one to
another. We touched first at the island of Madagascar, where,
though the people are fierce and treacherous, and, in particular,
very well armed with lances and bows, which they use with
inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well with them a
while; they treated us very civilly; and for some trifles which
we gave them, such as knives, scissors, &c., they brought us
eleven good fat bullocks, middling in size, but very good in
flesh, which we took in, partly for fresh provisions for our
present spending, and the rest to salt for the ship's use.
We were obliged to stay here some time after we had
furnished ourselves with provisions; and I, that was always too
curious to look into every nook of the world wherever I came,
was for going on shore as fast as I could. It was on the east
side of the island that we went on shore one evening, and the
people, who by the way are very numerous, came thronging
about us, and stood gazing at us at a distance; but as we had
traded freely with them, and had been kindly used, we thought
ourselves in no danger. But when we saw the people, we cut
three boughs out of a tree, and stuck them up at a distance
from us, which it seems is a mark in the country not only of
truce and friendship, but when it is accepted the other side set
up three poles or boughs, which is a signal that they accept the
truce too; but then this is a known condition of the truce, that
you are not to pass between their three poles towards them, nor
they to come past your three poles or boughs towards you; so
that you are perfectly secure within the three poles, and all the
space between your poles and theirs is allowed like a market
for free converse, traffic, and commerce. When you go there,
you must not carry your weapons with you; and if they come
into that space, they stick up their javelins and lances, all at the
first poles and come on unarmed ; but if any violence is offered
them, and the truce thereby broken, away they run to the
poles and lay hold of their weapons, and then the truce is at an
end.
It happened one evening when we went on shore that a
greater number of their people came down than usual, but all
was very friendly and civil, and they brought in several kinds
of provisions, for which we satisfied them with such toys as we
had; their women also brought us milk and roots, and several
things very acceptable to us, and all was quiet; and we made
us a little tent or hut, of some boughs of trees, and lay on shore
all night.
I knew not what was the occasion, but I was not so well
satisfied to lie on shore as the rest; and the boat lying at an
anchor about a stone cast from the land, with two men in her
to take care of her, I made one of them come on shore, and
getting some boughs of trees to cover us also in the boat, I
spread the sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay under the
cover of the branches of trees all night in the boat.
About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of our men
make a terrible noise on the shore, calling out for God's sake to
bring the boat in, and come and help them, for they were all
like to be murdered ; at the same time I heard the firing of five
muskets, which was the number of the guns they had, and that
three times over; for it seems the natives here were not so
easily frighted with guns as the savages were in America,
where I had to do with them.
All this while I knew not what was the matter; but rousing
immediately from sleep with the noise, I caused the boat to be
thrust in, and resolved, with three fusils we had on board, to
land and assist our men.
We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men were in too
much haste; for being come to the shore, they plunged into the
water to get to the boat with all the expedition they could,
being pursued by between three and four hundred men. Our
men were but nine in all, and only five of them had fusils with
them; the rest had, indeed, pistols and swords, but they were
of small use to them.
We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty enough
too, three of them being very ill wounded; and that which was
still worse was, that while we stood in the boat to take our men
in, we were in as much danger as they were in on shore; for
they poured their arrows in upon us so thick, that we were fain
to barricade the side of the boat up with the benches and two
or three loose boards, which to our great satisfaction we had by
mere accident, or providence, in the boat.
And yet had it been daylight, they are, it seems, such exact
marksmen, that if they could have seen but the least part of
any of us, they would have been sure of us. We had, by the
light of the moon, a little sight of them as they stood
pelting us from the shore with darts and arrows; and
having got ready our firearms, we gave them a volley, and we
could hear by the cries of some of them that we had wounded
several. However, they stood thus in battle array on the shore
till break of day, which we suppose was that they might see the
better to take their aim at us.
In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our
anchor, or set up our sail, because we must needs stand up in
the boat, and they were as sure to hit us, as we were to hit a
bird in a tree with small shot. We made signals of distress
to the ship, which, though we rode a league off, yet my nephew,
the captain, hearing our firing, and by glasses perceiving the
posture we lay in, and that we fired towards the shore, pretty
well understood us; and weighing anchor with all speed, he
stood as near the shore as he durst with the ship, and then sent
another boat with ten hands in her to assist us, but we called
to them not to come too near, telling them what condition we
were in. However, they stood in nearer to us; and one of the
men taking the end of a tow-line in his hand, and keeping our
boat between him and the enemy, so that they could not
perfectly see him, swam on board us, and made fast the line to
the boat, upon which we slipped our little cable, and leaving
our anchor behind, they towed us out of reach of the arrows,
we all the while lying close behind the barricade we had
made.
As soon as we were got from between the ship and the
shore, that she could lay her side to the shore, she ran along
just by them, and we poured in a broadside among them, loaden
with pieces of iron and lead, small bullets, and such stuff,
besides the great shot, which made a terrible havoc amongst
them.
When we were got on board and out of danger, we had time
to examine into the occasion of this fray; and indeed our
supercargo, who had been often in those parts, put me upon it;
for he said he was sure the inhabitants would not have touched
us after we had made a truce, if we had not done something to
provoke them to it. At length it came out, viz., that an old
woman, who had come to sell us some milk, had brought

SWAM ON BOARD us.
it within our poles, with a young woman with her, who also
brought some roots or herbs; and while the old woman,
whether she was mother to the young woman or no they could
not tell, was selling us the milk, one of our men offered some
rudeness to the wench that was with her, at which the old
woman made a great noise. However, the seaman would not
quit his prize, but carried her out of the old woman's sight
among the trees, it being almost dark. The old woman went
away without her, and, as we suppose, made an outcry among
the people she came from; who, upon notice, raised this great
army upon us in three or four hours; and it was great odds but
we had been all destroyed.
One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him just
at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent they
had made; the rest came off free, all but the fellow who was
the occasion of all the mischief, who paid dear enough for his
black mistress, for we could not hear what became of him a
great while. We lay upon the shore two days after, though
the wind presented, and made signals for him; made our boat
sail up shore and down shore several leagues, but in vain; so
we were obliged to give him over; and if he alone had suffered
for it, the loss had been the less.
I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing on
shore once more to try if I could learn anything of him or
them. It was the third night after the action that I had a
great mind to learn, if I could by any means, what mischief we
had done, and how the game stood on the Indians' side. I was
careful to do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked again;
but I ought indeed to have been sure that the men I went with
had been under my command before I engaged in a thing so
hazardous and mischievous, as I was brought into by it without
my knowledge or design.
We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in the ship,
besides the supercargo and myself; and we landed two hours
before midnight, at the same place where the Indians stood
drawn up the evening before. I landed here, because my
design, as I have said, was chiefly to see if they had quitted the
field, and if they had left any marks behind them of the
mischief we had done them; and I thought if we could surprise
one or two of them, perhaps we might get our man again by
way of exchange.
We landed without any noise, and divided our men into
two bodies, whereof the boatswain commanded one, and I the
other. We neither saw or heard anybody stir when we landed,
and we marched up, one body at a distance from the other, to
the place, but at first could see nothing, it being very dark;
till by-and-by our boatswain, that led the first party, stumbled
and fell over a dead body. This made them halt awhile; for
knowing by the circumstances that they were at the place
where the Indians had stood, they waited for my coming up.
Here we concluded to halt till the moon began to rise, which
we knew would be in less than an hour, when we could easily
discern the havoc we had made among them. We told two
and thirty bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not quite
dead; some had an arm, and some a leg, shot off, and one
his head: those that were wounded we supposed they had
carried away.
When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery of all we
could come at the knowledge of, I was resolved for going on
board; but the boatswain and his party sent me word that they
were resolved to make a visit to the Indian town, where these
dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and asked me to go along
with them ; and if they could find them, as still they fancied
they should, they did not doubt getting a good booty, and it
might be they might find Tho. Jeffery there; that was the
man's name we had lost.
Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well enough
what answer to have given them; for I would have commanded
them instantly on board, knowing it was not a hazard fit for
us to run who had a ship and ship-loading in our charge, and
a voyage to make, which depended very much upon the lives
of the men; but as they sent me word they were resolved to
go, and only asked me and my company to go along with
them, I positively refused it, and rose up, for I was sitting on
the ground, in order to go to the boat. One or two of the men
began to importune me to go, and when I refused positively
began to grumble, and say they were not under my command,
and they would go. "Come, Jack," says one of the men, "will
you go with me? I'll go for one." Jack said he would; and
another followed, and then another; and in a word, they all
left me but one, whom I persuaded to stay, and a boy left in
the boat; so the supercargo and I, with the third man, went
back to the boat, where we told them we would stay for them,
and take care to take in as many of them as should be left;
for I told them it was a mad thing they were going about, and
supposed most of them would run the fate of Thomas Jeffery.
They told me, like seamen, they'd warrant it they would
come off again, and they would take care, &c. So away they
went. I entreated them to consider the ship and voyage; that
their lives were not their own; and that they were entrusted
with the voyage in some measure; that if they miscarried, the
ship might be lost for want of their help; and that they could
not answer it to God or man. I said a great deal more to them
on that head, but I might as well have talked to the mainmast
of the ship; they were mad upon their journey; only they
gave me good words, and begged I would not be angry; that
they would be very cautious, and that they did not doubt but
they would be back again in about an hour at farthest; for the
Indian town, they said, was not above half a mile off, though
they found it above two miles before they got to it.
Well, they all went away, as above; and though the attempt
was desperate, and such as none but madmen would have gone
about, yet, to give them their due, they went about it as warily
as boldly. They were gallantly armed, that's true; for they had
every man a fusil or musket, a bayonet, and every man a pistol;
some of them had broad cutlasses, some of them hangers, and
theboatswainand two more had pole-axes ; besides all which they
had among them thirteen hand grenades. Bolder fellows, and
better provided,never went about any wicked work in the world.
When they went out their chief design was plunder, and
they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there; but a circum-
stance, which none of them were aware of, set them on fire
with revenge, and made devils of them all. When they came
to the few Indian houses which they thought had been the
town, which was not above half a mile off, they were under a
great disappointment; for there were not above twelve or
thirteen houses; and where the town was, or how big, they
knew not. They consulted therefore what to do, and were some
time before they could resolve; for if they fell upon these they
must cut all their throats, and it was ten to one but some of
them might escape, it being in the night, though the moon was
up; and if one escaped, he would run away and raise all the
town, so they should have a whole army upon them. Again,
on the other hand, if they went away, and left those untouched,
for the people were all asleep, they could not tell which way to
look for the town.
However, the last was the best advice; so they resolved to
leave them, and look for the town as well as they could. They
went on a little way, and found a cow tied to a tree; this they
presently concluded would be a good guide to them; for they
said the cow certainly belonged to the town before them or the
town behind them, and if they untied her they should see which
way she went. If she went back, they had nothing to say to
her; but if she went forward, they had nothing to do but to
follow her; so they cut the cord, which was made of twisted
flags, and the cow went on before them. In a word the cow led
2 B
them directly to the town, which, as they report, consisted of
above two hundred houses or huts, and in some of these they
found several families living together.
Here they found all in silence, as profoundly secure as sleep
and a country that had never seen an enemy of that kind could
make them. And first they called another council to consider
what they had to do, and in a word, they resolved to divide them-
selves into three bodies, and to set three houses on fire in three
parts of the town; and as the men came out, to seize them and
bind them; if any resisted, they need not be asked what to do
then, and so to search the rest of the houses for plunder; but
they resolved to march silently first through the town, and see
what dimensions it was of, and if they might venture upon it
or no.
They did so, and desperately resolved that they would
venture upon them; but while they were animating one another
to the work, three of them that were a little before the rest
called out aloud to them, and told them they had found Tom
Jeffery; they all ran up to the place; and so it was indeed, for
there they found the poor fellow, hanged up naked by one arm,
and his throat cut. There was an Indian house just by the
tree, where they found sixteen or seventeen of the principal
Indians who had been concerned in the fray with us before, and
two or three of them wounded with our shot; and our men
found they were awake, and talking one to another in that
house, but knew not their number.
The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them,
as before, that they swore to one another they would be
revenged, and that not an Indian who came into their hands
should have quarter; and to work they went immediately, and
yet not so madly as by the rage and fury they were in might
be expected. Their first care was to get something that would
soon take fire; but after a little search they found that would be
to no purpose, for most of the houses were low, and thatched
with flags or rushes, of which the country is full; so they
presently made some wild-fire, as we call it, by wetting a little
powder in the palms of their hands; and in a quarter of an
hour they set the town on fire in four or five places, and
particularly that house where the Indians were not gone to bed.
As soon as the fire began to blaze, the poor frighted creatures
began to rush out to save their lives, but met with their fate in
the attempt, and especially at the door, where they drove them
back, the boatswain himself killing one or two with his pole-
axe; the house being large, and many in it, he did not care to
go in, but called for a hand-grenade, and threw it among them,
which at first frighted them; but when it burst made such
havoc among them, that they cried out in a hideous manner.
In short, most of the Indians who were in the open part of
the house were killed or hurt with the grenade, except two or
three more, who pressed to the door, which the boatswain and
two more kept with their bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces,
and despatched all who came that way. But there was
another apartment in the house, where the prince, or king,
or whatever he was, and several others, were; and these they
kept in till the house, which was by this time all of a light
flame, fell in upon them, and they were smothered or burnt
together.
All this while they fired not a gun, because they would not
waken the people faster than they could master them; but the
fire began to waken them fast enough, and our fellows were
glad to keep a little together in bodies; for the fire grew so
raging, all the houses being made of light combustible stuff,
that they could hardly bear the street between them, and their
business was to follow the fire for the surer execution. As fast
as the fire either forced the people out of those houses which
were burning, or frighted them out of others, our people were
ready at their doors to knock them on the head, still calling
and hallooing to one another to remember Thomas Jeffery.
While this was doing I must confess I was very uneasy,
and especially when I saw the flames of the town, which, it
being night, seemed to be just by me.
My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his men too,
seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not knowing what the
matter was, or what danger I was in; especially hearing the
guns too, for by this time they began to use their firearms. A
thousand thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and the
supercargo, what should become of us; and at last, though he
could ill spare any more men, yet, not knowing what exigence
we might be in, he takes another boat, and with thirteen men
and himself come on shore to me.
He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the boat
with no more than two men; and though he was glad that we
were well, yet he was in the same impatience with us to know
what was doing; for the noise continued, and the flame increased.
In short, it was next to an impossibility for any men in
the world to restrain their curiosity to know what had happened,
or their concern for the safety of the men.
It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to talk to the
rest before; he would go, he said, and he only wished he had
left but ten men in the ship, for he could not think of having
his men lost for want of help; he had rather lose the ship, the
voyage, and his life and all, and away went he.
In a word, I was no more able to stay behind now than I was
to persuade them not to go; so, in short, the captain ordered two
men to row back the pinnace, and fetch twelve men more,
leaving the longboat at an anchor; and that when they came
back six men should keep the two boats, and six more come
after us, so that he left only sixteen men in the ship; for the
whole ship's company consisted of sixty-five men, whereof two
were lost in the last quarrel which brought this mischief on.
Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt little of
the ground we trod on; and being guided by the fire, we kept
no path, but went directly to the place of the flame. If the
noise of the guns were surprising to us before, the cries of the
poor people were now of quite another nature, and filled us with
horror. I must confess I never was at the sacking a city, or at
the taking a town by storm. I had heard of Oliver Cromwell
taking Drogheda in Ireland, and killing man, woman, and child;
and I had read of Count Tilly sacking the city of Magdeburg,
and cutting the throats of 22,000 of all sexes; but I never had
an idea of the thing itself before, nor is it possible to describe
it, or the horror which was upon our minds at hearing it.
However, we went on, and at length came to the town,
though there was no entering the streets of it for the fire. The
first object we met with was the ruins of a hut or house, or
rather the ashes of it, for the house was consumed; and just
before it, plain now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay four
men and three women killed; and, as we thought, one or two
more lay in the heap among the fire. In short, there were such
instances of a rage altogether barbarous, and of a fury some-
thing beyond what was human, that we thought it impossible
our men could be guilty of it; or if they were the authors of it,
we thought they ought to be every one of them put to the worst
of deaths. But this was not all; we saw the fire increased
forward, and the cry went on just as the fire went on, so that
we were in the utmost confusion. We advanced a little way
farther, and behold, to our astonishment, three women naked,
and crying in a most dreadful manner, come flying as if they
had indeed had wings, and after them sixteen or seventeen men,
natives, in the same terror and consternation, with three of our
English butchers, for I can call them no better, in their rear,
who when they could not overtake them fired in among them,
and one that was killed by their shot fell down in our sight.
When the rest saw us, believing us to be their enemies, and
that we would murder them as well as those that pursued them,
they set up a most dreadful shriek, especially the women, and
two of them fell down as if already dead with the fright.
My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran chill in
my veins when I saw this; and I believe had the three English
sailors that pursued them come on, I had made our men kill
them all. However, we took some ways to let the poor flying
creatures know that we would not hurt them, and immediately
they came up to us, and kneeling down, with their hands lifted
up, made piteous lamentation to us to save them, which we let
them know we would; whereupon they crept all together in a
huddle close behind us as for protection. I left my men drawn
up together, and charged them to hurt nobody, but if possible
to get at some of our people, and see what devil it was pos-
sessed them, and what they intended to do; and in a word, to
command them off, assuring them that if they stayed till day-
light they would have a hundred thousand men about their
ears; I say, I left them and went among those flying people,
taking only two of our men with me; and there was indeed a
piteous spectacle among them. Some of them had their feet
terribly burnt with trampling and running through the fire,
others their hands burnt. One of the women had fallen down
in the fire, and was very much burnt before she could get out
again; and two or three of the men had cuts in their backs and
thighs, from our men pursuing; and another was shot through
the body, and died while I was there.
I would fain have learned what the occasion of all this was,
but I could not understand one word they said, though by signs
I perceived that some of them knew not what was the occasion
themselves. I was so terrified in my thoughts at this out-
rageous attempt, that I could not stay there, but went back to
my own men, and resolved to go into the middle of the town
through the fire, or whatever might be in the way, and put an
end to it, cost what it would. Accordingly, as soon as I came
back to my men, I told them my resolution, and commanded
them to follow me, when in the very moment came four of our
men, with the boatswain at their head, roving over the heaps of
bodies they had killed, all covered with blood and dust, as if
they wanted more people to massacre, when our men hallooed
to them as loud as they could halloo, and with much ado one of
them made them hear, so that they knew who we were, and
came up to us.
As soon as the boatswain saw us he set up a halloo, like a
shout of triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come;
and without bearing to hear me, "Captain," says he, "noble
captain, I am glad you are come! We have not half done yet,
villainous hell-hound dogs! I'll kill as many of them as poor
Tom has hairs upon his head. We have sworn to spare none
of them; we'll root out the very nation of them from the earth."
And thus he ran on, out of breath, too, with action, and would
not give us leave to speak a word.
At last, raising my voice, that I might silence him a little,
"Barbarous dog!" said I, " what are you doing? I won't have
one creature touched more upon pain of death. I charge you
upon your life to stop your hands, and stand still here, or
you are a dead man this minute."
"Why, sir," says he, "do you know what you do, or what
they have done? If you want a reason for what we have done,
come hither "; and with that he showed me the poor fellow
hanging with his throat cut.
I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time

SHOWED THE POOR FELLOW HANGING WITH HIS THROAT CUT.
would have been forward enough; but I thought they had
carried their rage too far, and I thought of Jacob's words to his
sons Simeon and Levi, " Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce;
and their wrath, for it was cruel." But I had now a new task
upon my hands ; for when the men I carried with me saw the
sight as I had done, I had as much to do to restrain them as I
should have had with the others; nay, my nephew himself fell
in with them, and told me in their hearing that he was only
concerned for fear of the men being overpowered; for as to the
people, he thought not one of them ought to live; for they had
all glutted themselves with the murder of the poor man, and
that they ought to be used like murderers. Upon these words
away ran eight of my men with the boatswain and his crew to
complete their bloody work; and I, seeing it quite out of my
power to restrain them, came away pensive and sad, for I could
not bear the sight, much less the horrible noise and cries of the
poor wretches that fell into their hands.
I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo and
two men, and with these I walked back to the boats. It was a
very great piece of folly in me, I confess, to venture back as it
were alone; for as it began now to be almost day, and the
alarm had run over the country, there stood above forty men
armed with lances and bows at the little place where the twelve
or thirteen houses stood mentioned before; but by accident I
missed the place, and came directly to the seaside; and by the
time I got to the seaside it was broad day. Immediately I took
the pinnace and went aboard, and sent her back to assist the
men in what might happen.
I observed about the time that I came to the boat-side that
the fire was pretty well out, and the noise abated; but in about
half-an-hour after I got on board I heard a volley of our men's
firearms, and saw a great smoke; this, as I understood after-
wards, was our men falling upon the men who, as I said, stood
at the few houses on the way; of whom they killed sixteen or
seventeen, and set all those houses on fire, but did not meddle
with the women or children.
By that time the men got to the shore again with the
pinnace our men began to appear; they came dropping in
some and some, not in two bodies, and in form, as they went,
but all in heaps, straggling here and there in such a manner
that a small force of resolute men might have cut them all off.
But the dread of them was upon the whole country; and
the men were amazed and surprised, and so frighted, that I
believe a hundred of them would have fled at the sight of but
five of our men. Nor in all this terrible action was there a man
who made any considerable defence; they were so surprised
between the terror of the fire, and the sudden attack of our men
in the dark, that they knew not which way to turn themselves;
for if they fled one way, they were met by one party; if back
again, by another; so that they were everywhere knocked
down. Nor did any of our men receive the least hurt, except
one, who strained his foot, and another had one of his hands
very much burnt.
I was very angry with my nephew the captain, and indeed
with all the men, in my mind, but with him in particular, as
well for his acting so out of his duty as commander of the
ship, and having the charge of the voyage upon him, as in his
prompting rather than cooling the rage of his men in so bloody
and cruel an enterprise. My nephew answered me very
respectfully, but told me that when he saw the body of the poor
seaman whom they had murdered in such a cruel and barbarous
manner he was not master of himself, neither could he govern
his passion. He owned he should not have done so, as he was
commander of the ship; but as he was a man, and nature
moved him, he could not bear it. As for the rest of the men,
they were not subject to me at all, and they knew it well
enough, so they took no notice of my dislike.
The next day we set sail, so we never heard any more of it.
Our men differed in the account of the number they killed;
some said one thing, some another; but according to the best
of their accounts, put all together, they killed or destroyed
about one hundred and fifty people, men, women, and children,
and left not a house standing in the town.
As for the poor fellow, Tho. Jeffery, as he was quite dead,
for his throat was so cut that his head was half off, it would do
him no service to bring him away; so they left him where they
found him, only took him down from the tree where he was
hanged by one hand.
However just our men thought this action, I was against
them in it, and I always after that time told them God would
blast the voyage; for I looked upon all the blood they shed
that night to be murder in them; for though it is true that they
had killed Tho. Jeffery, yet it was as true that Jeffery was the
aggressor.
The first disaster that befell us was in the Gulf of Persia,
where five of our men venturing on shore on the Arabian side
of the gulf were surrounded by the Arabians, and either all
killed or carried away into slavery; the rest of the boat's crew
were not able to rescue them, and had but just time to get off
their boat. I began to upbraid them with the just retribution
of Heaven in this case; but the boatswain very warmly told me
he thought I went farther in my censures than I could show
any warrant for.
But my frequent preaching to them on this subject had
worse consequences than I expected; and the boatswain, who
had been the head of the attempt, came up boldly to me one
time, and told me he found that I continually brought that
affair upon the stage, that I made unjust reflections upon it,
and had used the men very ill on that account, and himself in
particular; that as I was but a passenger, and had no command
in the ship, or concern in the voyage, they were not obliged to
bear it; that they did not know that I might have some ill
design in my head, and perhaps to call them to account for it
when they came to England; and that, therefore, unless I would
resolve to have done with it, and also not to concern myself
any farther with him, or any of his affairs, he would leave the
ship; for he did not think it was safe to sail with me among
them.
I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then
told him that I did confess I had all along opposed the massacre
of Madagascar, for such I would always call it; and that I had
on all occasions spoken my mind freely about it, though not
more upon him than any of the rest; that as to my having no
command in the ship, that was true, nor did I exercise any
authority, only took my liberty of speaking my mind in things
which publicly concerned us all; and what concern I had in the
voyage was none of his business; that I was a considerable
owner of the ship, and in that claim I conceived I had a right
to speak, even farther than I had yet done, and would not be
accountable to him or any one else; and began to be a little
warm with him. He made but little reply to me at that time,
and I thought that affair had been over. We were at this time
in the road at Bengal; and being willing to see the place, I went
on shore with the supercargo in the ship's boat to divert myself;
and towards evening was preparing to go on board, when one
of the men came to me, and told me he would not have me
trouble myself to come down to the boat, for they had orders
not to carry me on board any more. Any one may guess what
a surprise I was in at so insolent a message; and I asked the
man who bade him deliver that errand to me? He told me the
coxswain. I said no more to the fellow, but bade him let them
know he had delivered his message, and that I had given him
no answer to it.
I immediately went and found out the supercargo and told
him the story, adding what I presently foresaw, viz., that there
would certainly be a mutiny in the ship, and entreated him to
go immediately on board the ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint
the captain of it. But I might have spared this intelligence,
for before I had spoken to him on shore the matter was effected
on board. The boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and, in a
word, all the inferior officers, as soon as I was gone off in the
boat, came up to the quarter-deck and desired to speak with
the captain; and there the boatswain making a long harangue,
for the fellow talked very well, and repeating all he had said to
me, told the captain in a few words that as I was now gone
peaceably on shore, they were loath to use any violence with
me; which if I had not gone on shore, they would otherwise
have done, to oblige me to have gone. They therefore thought
fit to tell him that as they shipped themselves to serve
in the ship under his command, they would perform it well and
faithfully; but if I would not quit the ship, or the captain oblige
me to quit it, they would all leave the ship, and sail no farther
with him; and at that word "all," he turned his face about
towards the mainmast, which was.it seems, the signal agreed on
between them, at which all the seamen being got together they
cried out, " One and all, one and all!"
My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of great
presence of mind; and though he was surprised, you may be
sure, at the thing, yet he told them calmly that he would consider
of the thing, but that he could do nothing in it till he had
spoken to me about it. He used some arguments with them to
show them the unreasonableness and injustice of the thing, but
it was all in vain; they swore, and shook hands round, before
his face, that they would go all on shore unless he would engage
to them not to suffer me to come any more on board the
ship.
This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obligation
to me, and did not know how I might take-it; so he began to
talk cavalierly to them; told them that I was a very consider-
able owner of the ship, and that in justice he could not put me
out of my own house; that this was next door to serving me
as the famous pirate Kidd had done, who made the mutiny
in a ship, set the captain on shore in an uninhabited island, and
ran away with the ship; that let them go into what ship they
would, if ever they came to England again it would cost them dear;
that the ship was mine, and that he could not put me out of it;
and that he would rather lose the ship, and the voyage too,than
disoblige me so much; so they might do as they pleased.
However, he would go on shore, and talk with me on shore, and
invited the boatswain to go with him, and perhaps they might
accommodate the matter with me.
But they all rejected the proposal, and said they would have
nothing to do with me any more, neither on board or on shore;
and if I came on board, they would all go on shore. "Well,"
said the captain, " if you are all of this mind, let me go on shore
and talk with him " ; so away he came to me with this account,
a little after the message had been brought to me from the
coxswain.
I was very glad to see my nephew I must confess, for I was
not without apprehensions that they would confine him by
violence, set sail, and run away with the ship; and then I had
been stripped naked, in a remote country, and nothing to help
myself; in short, I had been in a worse case than when I was
all alone in the island.
But they had not come that length, it seems, to my great
satisfaction; and when my nephew told me what they had said
to him, and how they had sworn, and shook hands, that they
would one and all leave the ship if I was suffered to come on
board, I told him he should not be concerned at it at all, for I
would stay on shore. I only desired he would take care and
send me all my necessary things on shore, and leave me a
sufficient sum of money, and I would find my way to England
as well as I could.
This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew; but there
was no way to help it, but to comply with it. So, in short, he
went on board the ship again, and satisfied the men that his
uncle had yielded to their importunity, and had sent for his
goods from on board the ship. So that matter was over in a
very few hours; the men returned to their duty and I began to
consider what course I should steer.
I was now alone in the remotest part of the world, as I think
I may call it, for I was near three thousand leagues, by sea,
farther off from England than I was at my island; only, it is
true, I might travel here by land over the Great Mogul's country
to Surat, might go from thence to Bassora by sea, up the Gulf
of Persia, and from thence might take the way of the caravans
over the desert of Arabia to Aleppo and Scanderoon, from thence
by sea again to Italy, and so overland into France; and this,put
together, might be, at least, a full diameter of the globe; but if
it were to be measured, I suppose it would appear to be a great
deal more.
I had another way before me, which was to wait for some
English ships which were coming to Bengal from Acheen, on
the island of Sumatra, and get passage on board them for
England; but as I came hither without any concern with the
English East India Company, so it would be difficult to go from
hence without their licence, unless with great favour of the
captains of the ships, or of the Company's factors; and to both
I was an utter stranger.
Here I had the particular pleasure, speaking by contraries,
to see the ship sail without me; a treatment, I think, a man in
my circumstances scarce ever met with, except from pirates
running away with a ship, and setting those that would not
agree with their villainy on shore; indeed this was next
door to it both ways. However, my nephew left me two
servants, or rather, one companion and one servant; the first
was clerk to the purser, whom he engaged to go with me, and
the other was his own servant. I took me also a good lodging
in the house of an Englishwoman, where several merchants
lodged, some French, two Italians, or rather Jews, and one
Englishman. Here I was handsomely enough entertained ; and
that I might not be said to run rashly upon anything, I stayed
here above nine months, considering what course to take, and
how to manage myself. I had some English goods with me of
value, and a considerable sum of money; my nephew furnishing
me with a thousand pieces of eight, and a letter of credit for
more, if I had occasion, that I might not be straitened, whatever
might happen. I quickly disposed of my goods, and to
advantage too; and as I originally intended. I bought here some
very good diamonds, which, of all other things, was the most
proper for me in my present circumstances, because I might
always carry my whole estate about me.
After a long stay here, and many proposals made for my
return to England, but none falling out to my mind, the
English merchant who lodged with me, and with whom I had
contracted an intimate acquaintance, came to me one morning.
"Countryman," says he," I have a project to communicate to you,
which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit
with yours also, when you shall have thoroughly considered it.
"Here we are posted," says he, " you by accident, and I by
my own choice, in a part of the world very remote from our own
country; but it is in a country where, by us who understand
trade and business, a great deal of money is to be got. If you
will put a thousand pounds to my thousand pounds, we will hire
a ship here, the first we can get to our minds; you shall be
captain, I'll be merchant, and we will go a trading voyage to
China; for what should we stand still for? The whole world
is in motion, rolling round and round; all the creatures of God,
heavenly bodies and earthly, are busy and diligent; why should
we be idle? There are no drones in the world, but men ; why
should we be of that number?"
I liked his proposal very well; and the more because it
seemed to be expressed with so much good will, and in so
friendly a manner. I will not say but that I might, by my
loose and unhinged circumstances, be the fitter to embrace a
proposal for trade, or indeed for anything else; whereas other-
wise, trade was none of my element. However, I might,
perhaps, say with some truth, that if trade was not my element,
rambling was; and no proposal for seeing any part of the world
which I never had seen before, could possibly come amiss to me.
It was, however, some time before we could get a ship to our
minds; and when we had got a vessel, it was not easy to get
English sailors; that is to say, so many as were necessary to
govern the voyage, and manage the sailors which we should pick
up there. After some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a
gunner, English; a Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese
foremastmen; with these we found we could do well enough,
having Indian seamen, such as they are, to make up.
There are so many travellers who have wrote the history of
their voyages and travels this way, that it would be very little
diversion to anybody to give a long account of the places we
went to, and the people who inhabit there. Those things I
leave to others, and refer the reader to those journals and
travels of Englishmen, of which many I find are published, and
more promised every day. Tis enough to me to tell you that
I made this voyage to Acheen, in the island of Sumatra, and
from thence to Siam, where we exchanged some of our wares
for opium, and some arrack; the first a commodity which bears
a great price among the Chinese, and which, at that time, was
very much wanted there; in a word, we went up to Suskan,
made a very great voyage, were eight months out, and returned
to Bengal, and I was very well satisfied with my adventure.
I observe, that our people in England often admire how the
officers which the Company send into India, and the merchants
which generally stay there, get such very great estates as they do,
and sometimes come home worth sixty to seventy and a hundred
thousand pounds at a time. But it is no wonder, or at least we
shall see so much farther into it, when we consider the innumer-
able ports and places where they have a free commerce,
that it will then be no wonder; and much less will it be so when
we consider, at all those places and ports where the English
ships come, there is so much and such constant demand for the
growth of all other countries, that there is a certain vent for the
returns, as well as a market abroad for the goods carried out.
In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so much
money by the first adventure, and such an insight into the
method of getting more, that had I been twenty years younger
I should have been tempted to have stayed here, and sought no
farther for making my fortune. But what was all this to a man
on the wrong side of threescore, that was rich enough, and came
abroad more in obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world
than a covetous desire of getting in it? And indeed I think 'tis
with great justice that I now call it a restless desire, for it was
so. When I was at home, I was restless to go abroad; and
now I was abroad, I was restless to be at home. I say, what
gain was this to me?
But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions. I do
not name this to insist upon my own, for I acknowledge his were
the most just, and the most suited to the end of a merchant's
life, who, when he is abroad upon adventures, 'tis his wisdom
to stick to that as the best thing for him, which he is like to get
the most money by. My new friend kept himself to the nature
of the thing, and would have been content to have gone, like a
carrier's horse, always to the same inn, backward and forward,
provided he could, as he called it, find his account in it; on the
other hand, mine was the notion of a mad rambling boy, that
never cares to see a thing twice over.
But this was not all. I had a kind of impatience upon me
to be nearer home, and yet the most unsettled resolution im-
aginable which way to go. In the interval of these consultations,
my friend, who was always upon the search for business, pro-
posed another voyage to me among the Spice Islands, and to
bring home a loading of cloves from the Manillas, or there-
abouts; places where, indeed, the Dutch do trade but islands
belonging partly to the Spaniards; though we went not so far,
but to some other, where they have not the whole power, as they
have at Batavia, Ceylon, etc. We were not long in preparing
for this voyage; the chief difficulty was in bringing me to come
into it. However, nothing else offering, and finding that really
stirring about and trading, the profit being so great, and, as I
may say, certain, had more pleasure in it, and more satisfaction
to the mind, than sitting still, which, to me especially, was the
unhappiest part of life, I resolved on this voyage too, which we
made very successfully, touching at Borneo and several islands,
whose names I do not remember, and came home in about five
months. We sold our spice, which was chiefly cloves, and some
nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who carried them away for
the gulf; and making near five of one, we really got a great
deal of money.
My friend, when we made up this account, smiled at me.
"Well, now," said he, with a sort of agreeable insult upon my
indolent temper," is not this better than walking about here,
like a man of nothing to do, and spending our time in staring
at the nonsense and ignorance of the pagans?" "Why truly,"
says I, " my friend, I think it is, and I begin to be a convert to
the principles of merchandising; but I must tell you," said 1,
"by the way, you do not know what I am a-doing; for if once
I conquer my backwardness, and embark heartily, as old as I
am, I shall harass you up and down the world till I tire you;
for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let you He
still."
But to be short with my speculations. A little while after
this there came in a Dutch ship from Batavia; she was a
coaster, not an European trader, and of about two hundred tons
burden; the men, as they pretended, having been so sickly,
that the captain had not men enough to go to sea with. He
lay by at Bengal; and having, it seems, got money enough, or
being willing for other reasons to go for Europe, he gave public
notice that he would sell his ship. This came to my ears be-
fore my new partner heard of it, and I had a great mind to
buy it; so I goes home to him, and told him of it. He con-
sidered awhile, for he was no rash man either; but musing
some time, he replied, "She is a little too big; but, however,
we will have her." Accordingly we bought the ship; and
agreeing with the master, we paid for her, and took possession.
When we had done so, we resolved to entertain the men, if we
could, to join them with those we had, for the pursuing our
business; but on a sudden, they having received not their
wages, but their share of the money, not one of them was to be
found. We inquired much about them, and at length were told
that they were all gone together, by land, to Agra, the great
city of the Mogul's residence; and from thence were to travel
to Surat, and so by sea to the Gulf of Persia.
Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while, as that
I missed the opportunity of going with them; for such a
ramble I thought, and in such company as would both have
guarded me and diverted me, would have suited mightily with
my great design; and I should both have seen the world, and
gone homewards too. But I was much better satisfied a few
days after, when I came to know what sort of fellows they
were; for, in short, their history was, that this man they called
captain was the gunner only, not the commander; that they
had been a trading voyage, in which they were attacked on
shore by some of the Malayans, who had killed the captain and
three of his men; and that after the captain was killed these
men, eleven in number, had resolved to run away with the
ship, which they did, and brought her in at the Bay of Bengal,
leaving the mate and five men more on shore; of whom we
shall hear further.
Well, let them come by the ship how they would, we came
2C
honestly by her, as we thought; though we did not, I confess,
examine into things so exactly as we ought; for we never
inquired anything of the seamen, who, if we had examined,
would certainly have faltered in their account, contradicted one
another, and perhaps contradicted themselves; or, one how
or other, we should have seen reason to have suspected them.
But the man showed us a bill of sale for the ship to one
Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such name, for I suppose it
was all a forgery, and called himself by that name; and we
could not contradict him; and being withal a little too unwary,
or at least having no suspicion of the thing, we went through
with our bargain.
We picked up some more English seamen here after this,
and some Dutch; and now we resolved for a second voyage to
the south-east for cloves, &c., that is to say, among the Philippine
and Malacca Isles; and in short, not to fill this part of my
story with trifles, when what is yet to come is so remarkable, I
spent, from first to last, six years in this country, trading from
port to port, backward and forward, and with very good
success; and was now the last year with my new partner,
going in the ship above-mentioned, on a voyage to China, but
designing first to Siam, to buy rice.
In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat up
and down a great while in the Straits of Malacca, and among
the islands, we were no sooner got clear of those difficult seas,
but we found our ship had sprung a leak, and we were not able,
by all our industry, to find it out where it was. This forced us
to make for some port; and my partner, who knew the country
better than I did, directed the captain to put into the river
of Cambodia; for I had made the English mate, one Mr
Thompson, captain, not being willing to take the charge of two
ships upon myself. This river lies on the north side of the
great bay or gulf which goes up to Siam.
While we were here, and going often on shore for refresh-
ment, there comes to me one day an Englishman, and he was,
it seems, a gunner's mate on board an English East India ship,
which rode in the same river, up at or near the city of Cam-
bodia. What brought him hither, we know not; but he comes
up to me, and speaking in English, " Sir," says he, " you are a
stranger to me, and I to you; but I have something to tell you,
that very nearly concerns you."
I looked steadily at him a good while, and thought at first I
had known him, but I did not. "If it very nearly concerns
me," said I, " and not yourself, what moves you to tell it me?"
—" I am moved," says he, " by the imminent danger you are
in; and, for ought I see, you have no knowledge of it."—" I know
no danger I am in," said I," but that my ship is leaky, and I
cannot find it out; but I purpose to lay her aground to-morrow,
to see if I can find it."—" But, sir," says he, "leaky or not
leaky, find it or not find it, you will be wiser than to lay your
ship on shore to-morrow, when you hear what I have to say to
you. Do you know, sir," said he, " the town of Cambodia lies
about fifteen leagues up this river? And there are two large
English ships about five leagues on this side, and three Dutch."
—"Well," said I, "and what is that to me?"—"Why, sir,"
said he " is it for a man that is upon such adventures as you are
upon to come into a port and not examine first what ships there
are there, and whether he is able to deal with them? I suppose
you do not think you are a match for them?" I was amused
very much at his discourse, but not amazed at it, for I could
not conceive what he meant. I turned short upon him, and
said, " Sir, I wish you would explain yourself; I cannot imagine
what reason I have to be afraid of any company of ships, or
Dutch ships; I am no interloper; what can they have to say
to me?"
He looked like a man half angry, half pleased; and pausing
awhile, but smiling, " Well, sir," said he, " if you think yourself
secure, you must take your chance. I am sorry your fate
should blind you against good advice; but assure yourself if
you do not put to sea immediately, you will the very next tide
be attacked by five longboats full of men; and perhaps, if you
are taken, you will be hanged for a pirate, and the particulars
be examined afterwards. I thought, sir," added he, " I should
have met with a better reception than this for doing you a
piece of service of such importance."—" I can never be ungrate-
ful," said I, " for any service, or to any man that offers me any
kindness; but it is past my comprehension," said I, "what they
should have such a design upon me for. However, since you
say there is no time to be lost, and that there is some villainous
design in hand against me, I'll goon board this minute, and put
to sea immediately, if my men can stop the leak, or if we can
swim without stopping it; but, sir," said I, " shall I go away
ignorant of the reason of all this? Can you give me no farther
light into it?"
"I can tell you but part of the story, sir," says he; "but I
have a Dutch seaman here with me, and I believe I could
persuade him to tell you the rest; but there is scarce time for
it. But the short of the story is this, the first part of which, I
suppose, you know well enough, viz., that you was with this
ship at Sumatra; that there your captain was murdered by the
Malayans, with three of his men; and that you, or some of
those who were on board with you, ran away with the ship, and
are since turned pirates. This is the sum of the story, and you
will be all seized as pirates, I can assure you, and executed
with very little ceremony; for you know merchant-ships show
but little law to pirates, if they get them into their power."
"Now you speak plain English," said I, "and I thank you;
and though I know nothing that we have done like what you
talk of, but am sure we came honestly and fairly by the ship,
yet seeing such work is a-doing, as you say, and that you seem
to mean honestly, I'll be upon my guard."—"Nay, sir," says he,
"do not talk of being upon your guard; the best defence is to
be out of the danger. If you have any regard to your life, and
the lives of all your men, put out to sea without fail at high-
water; and as you have a whole tide before you, you will be
gone too far out before they can come down, for they come
away at high-water; and as they have twenty miles to come,
you get near two hours of them by the difference of the tide,
not reckoning the length of the way; besides, as they are only
boats, and not ships, they will not venture to follow you far out
to sea, especially if it blows."
"Well," says I, "you have been very kind in this; what
shall I do for you to make you amends ?"—" Sir," says he,
"you may not be so willing to make me any amends, because
you may not be convinced of the truth of it. I'll make an offer
to you. I have nineteen months' pay due to me on board the
ship , which I came out of England in; and the Dutch-
man that is with me has seven months' pay due to him; if you
will make good our pay to us, we will go along with you; and
if you find no more in it, we will desire no more; but if we do
convince you that we have saved your lives, and the ship, and
the lives of all the men in her, we will leave the rest to you."
I consented to this readily, and went immediately on board,
and the two men with me. As soon as I came to the ship's
side, my partner, who was on board, came out on the quarter-
deck, and called to me with a greal deal of joy, " O ho! O ho!
we have stopped the leak! we have stopped the leak !"—" Say
you so?" said I; "thank God! but weigh the anchor im-
mediately."—"Weigh!" says he; "what do you mean by that?
What is the matter?" says he.—"Ask no questions," says I,
"but all hands to work, and weigh without losing a minute."
He was surprised; but, however, he called the captain, and he
immediately ordered the anchor to be got up; and though the
tide was not quite done, yet a little land-breeze blowing, we
stood out to sea. Then I called him into the cabin, and told
him the story at large; and we called in the men, and they told
us the rest of it. But as it took us up a great deal of time, so
before we had done a seaman comes to the cabin door, and
calls out to us, that the captain bade him tell us we were
chased. "Chased !" said I ; "by whom, and by what ? "—" By
five sloops, or boats," says the fellow, "full of men."—" Very
well," said I; "then it is apparent there is something in it." In
the next place, I ordered all our men to be called up, and told
them that there was a design to seize the ship, and to take us
for pirates, and asked them if they would stand by us, and by
one another? The men answered cheerfully that, one and all,
they would live and die with us. Then I asked the captain
what way he though best for us to manage the fight with them,
for resist them I was resolved we would, and that to the last
drop. He said readily, that the way was to keep them off with
our great shot as long as we could, and then to fire at them
with our small arms as long as we could; but when neither of
these would do any longer, we should retire to our close
quarters; perhaps they had not materials to break open our
bulk-heads, or get in upon us.
The gunner had, in the meantime, order to bring two guns
to bear fore and aft out of the steerage, to clear the deck, and
load them with musket-bullets and small pieces of old iron, and
what next came to hand, and thus we made ready for fight;
but all this while we kept out to sea, with wind enough, and
could see the boats at a distance, being five large longboats,
following us with all the sail they could make.
Two of these boats, which by our glasses we could see were
English, outsailed the rest, and were near two leagues ahead of
them, and gained upon us considerably, so that we found they
would come up with us; upon which we fired a gun without
ball, to intimate that they should bring to; and we put out a
flag of truce, as a signal for parley; but they kept crowding
after us till they came within shot, when we took in our white
flag, they having made no answer to it, hung out a red flag,
and fired at them with a shot. Notwithstanding this they
came on till they were near enough to call to them with a
speaking trumpet, which we had on board; so we called to
them, and bid them keep off at their peril.
It was all one; they crowded after us, and endeavoured to
come under our stern, so to board us on our quarter; upon
which, seeing they were resolute for mischief, and depended
upon the strength that followed them, I ordered to bring the
ship to, so that they lay upon our broadside, when immediately
we fired five guns at them, one of which had been levelled so
true as to carry away the stern of the hindermost boat, and
bring them to the necessity of taking down their sail, and
running all to the head of the boat to keep her from sinking.
So she lay by, and had enough of it; but seeing the foremost
boat crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her in
particular.
While this was doing, one of the three boats that was
behind, being forwarder than the other two, made up to the
boat which we had disabled, to relieve her, and we could after-
wards see her take out the men. We called again to the fore-
most boat, and offered a truce to parley again, and to know
what was her business with us, but had no answer: only she
crowded close under our stern. Upon this our gunner, who
was a very dexterous fellow, ran out his two chase-guns, and
fired again at her; but the shot missing, the men in the boat
shouted, waved their caps, and came on. But the gunner,
getting quickly ready again, fired among them the second time,
one shot of which, though it missed the boat itself, yet fell in
among the men, and we could easily see had done a great deal
of mischief among them; but we, taking no notice of that,
wared the ship again, and brought our quarter to bear upon
them, and firing three guns more, we found the boat was split
almost to pieces; in particular, her rudder, and a piece of her
stern, were shot quite away; so they handed their sail immedi-
ately, and were in great disorder; but to complete their mis-
fortune our gunner let fly two guns at them again; where he
hit them we could not tell, but we found the boat was sinking,
and some of the men already in the water. Upon this I imme-
diately manned out our pinnace, which we had kept close by
our side, with orders to pick up some of the men, if they could,
and save them from drowning, and immediately to come on
board with them, because we saw the rest of the boats began to
come up. Our men in the pinnace followed their orders, and
took up three men; one of which was just drowning, and it
was a good while before we could recover him. As soon as
they were on board we crowded all the sail we could make, and
stood farther out to sea; and we found that when the other
three boats came up to the first two, they gave over their chase.
Being thus delivered from a danger, which, though I knew
not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater than I
apprehended, I took care that we would change our course, and
not let any one imagine whither we were going; so we stood
out to sea eastward, quite out of the course of all European
ships, whether they were bound to China, or anywhere else
within the commerce of the European nations.
When we were now at sea, we began to consult with the
two seamen, and inquire first what the meaning of all this
should be? and the Dutchman let us into the secret of it at
once, telling us that the fellow that sold us the ship, as we said,
was no more than a thief that had run away with her. Then
he told us how the captain, whose name too he told us, though
I do not remember, was treacherously murdered by the natives
on the coast of Malacca, with three of his men; and that he,
this Dutchman and four more, got into the woods, where they
wandered about a great while; till at length he, in particular,
in a miraculous manner made his escape, and swam off to a
Dutch ship, which sailing near the shore in its way from China,
had sent their boat on shore for fresh water; that he durst not
come to that part of the shore where the boat was, but made
shift in the night to take the water farther off, and the ship's
boat took him up.
He then told us that he went to Batavia, where two of the
seamen belonging to the ship arrived, having deserted the rest
in their travels; and gave an account that the fellow who had
run away with the ship sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates,
which were gone a-cruising in her, and that they had already
taken an English ship and two Dutch ships, very richly laden.
This latter part we found to concern us directly; and though
we knew it to be false, yet, as my partner said very well, if we
had fallen into their hands, and they had had such a pre-
possession against us beforehand, it had been in vain for us to
have defended ourselves, or to hope for any good quarter at
their hands; and especially considering that our accusers had
been our judges, and that we could have expected nothing from
them but what rage would have dictated, and an ungoverned
passion have executed; and therefore it was his opinion we
should go directly back to Bengal, from whence we came, with-
out putting in at any port whatever, because there we could
give a good account of ourselves, could prove where we were
when the ship put in, whom we bought her of, and the like; and
which was more than all the rest, if we were put to the necessity
of bringing it before the proper judges, we should be sure to
have some justice, and not be hanged first, and judged afterwards.
I was some time of my partner's opinion; but after a little
more serious thinking, I told him I thought it was a very great
hazard for us to attempt returning to Bengal, for that we were
on the wrong side of the Straits of Malacca; and that if the
alarm was given, we should be sure to be waylaid on every side,
as well by the Dutch of Batavia, as the English elsewhere; that
if we should be taken, as it were running away, we should even
condemn ourselves, and there would want no more evidence to
destroy us. I also asked the English sailor's opinion, who said
he was of my mind, and that we should certainly be taken.
This made me very anxious to make an escape, though
which way to do it I knew not, or what port or place we should
go to. My partner, seeing me thus dejected, though he was the
most concerned at first, began to encourage me, and describing
to me the several ports of that coast, told me he would put in
on the coast of Cochin China, or the bay of Tonquin; intending
to go afterwards to Macao, a town once in the possession of the
Portuguese, and where still a great many European families
resided, and particularly the missionary priests usually went
thither, in order to their going-forward to China.
Hither then we resolved to go; and accordingly, though
after a tedious and irregular course, and very much straitened
for provisions, we came within sight of the coast very early in
the morning; and upon reflection upon the past circumstances
we were in, and the danger, if we had not escaped, we resolved
to put into a small river, which, however, had a depth enough
of water for us, and to see if we could, either overland or by the
ship's pinnace, come to know what ships were in any ports
thereabouts. This happy step was, indeed, our deliverance;
for though we did not immediately see any European ships in
the bay of Tonquin, yet the next morning there came into the
bay two Dutch ships, and a third without any colours spread
out, but which we believed to be a Dutchman, passed by at
about two leagues' distance, steering for the coast of China;
and in the afternoon went by two English ships, steering the
same course; and thus we thought we saw ourselves beset with
enemies, both one way or other. The place we were in was
wild and barbarous, the people thieves, even by occupation or
profession; and though, it is true, we had not much to seek of
them, and except getting a few provisions, cared not how little
we had to do with them, yet it was with much difficulty that
we kept ourselves from being insulted by them several ways.
I have observed above that our ship sprung a leak at sea,
and that we could not find it out; and however it happened
that, as I have said, it was stopped unexpectedly in the happy
minute of our being to be seized by the Dutch and English
ships in the bay of Siam, yet as we did not find the ship so
perfectly fit and sound as we desired, we resolved while we were
in this place to lay her on shore, take out what heavy things
we had on board, which were not many, and to wash and clean
her bottom, and if possible to find out where the leaks were.
Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and brought all our
guns and other movable things to one side, we tried to bring
her down, that we might come at her bottom; but on second
thoughts we did not care to lay her dry on ground, neither
could we find out a proper place for it.
The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with such
a sight, came wondering down to the shore to look at us; and
seeing the ship lie down on one side in such a manner, and
heeling in towards the shore, and not seeing our men, who were
at work on her bottom with stages and with their boats, on the
off side, they presently concluded that the ship was cast away,
and so lay fast on the ground.
On this supposition they came all about us in two or three
hours' time, with ten or twelve large boats, having some of them
eight, some ten men in a boat, intending, no doubt, to have
come on board and plundered the ship; and if they had found
us there, to have carried us away for slaves to their king, or
whatever they call him, for we knew nothing who was their
governor.
When they came up to the ship and began to row round
her, they discovered us all hard at work on the outside of the
ship's bottom and side, washing, and graving, and stooping, as
every seafaring man knows how.
They stood for awhile gazing at us, and we, who were a
little surprised, could not imagine what their design was; but
being willing to be sure, we took this opportunity to get some
of us into the ship, and others to hand down arms and ammuni-
tion to those that were at work to defend themselves with, if
there should be occasion; and it was no more than need, for in
less than a quarter of an hour's consultation they agreed, it seems,
that the ship was really a wreck; that we were all at work
endeavouring to save her, or to save our lives by the help of our
boats; and when we handed our arms into the boats, they con-
cluded by that motion that we were endeavouring to save some
of our goods. Upon this they took it for granted we all
belonged to them, and away they came down upon our men, as
if it had been in a line of battle.
"SALUTED THErtWITH A LADLE-FULL OFTHE STUFF.BOILING HOT'
Our men seeing so many of them began to be Frighted, for
we lay but in an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us to know
what they should do. I immediately called to the men who
worked upon the stage to slip them down and get up the side
into the ship, and bade those in the boat to row round and come
on board; and those few of us who were on board worked with
all the strength and hands we had to bring the ship to rights;
but, however, neither the men upon the stage, or those in the
boats, could do as they were ordered before the Cochin Chinese
were upon them, and two of their boats boarded our longboat,
and began to lay hold of the men as their prisoners.
The first man they laid hold of was an English seaman, a
stout, strong fellow, who having a musket in his hand never
offered to fire it, but laid it down in the boat, like a fool as I
thought. But he understood his business better than I could
teach him; for he grappled the pagan, and dragged him by
main force out of their own boat into ours, where taking him
by the two ears he beat his head so against the boat's gunnel,
that the fellow died instantly in his hands; and in the mean-
time a Dutchman, who stood next, took up the musket, and
with the butt-end of it so laid about him, that he knocked down
five of them who attempted to enter the boat. But this was
doing little towards resisting thirty or forty men, who, fearless,
because ignorant of their danger, began to throw themselves
into the longboat, where we had but five men in all to defend it.
But one accident gave our men a complete victory, which
deserved our laughter rather than anything else, and that was
this.
Our carpenter being preparing to grave the outside of the
ship, as well as to pay the seams where he had caulked her to
stop the leaks, had got two kettles just let down into the boat,
one filled with boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow,
and oil, and such stuff as the shipwrights use for that work;
and the man that attended the carpenter had a great iron ladle
in his hand, with which he supplied the men that were at work
with that hot stuff. Two of the enemy's men entered the boat
just where this fellow stood, being in the fore-sheets; he im-
mediately saluted them with a ladleful of the stuff, boiling hot,
which so burned and scalded them, being half naked, that they
roared out like two bulls, and enraged with the fire, leaped both
into the sea. The carpenter saw it, and cried out, "Well done,
Jack, give them some more of it"; and stepping forward him-
self takes one of their mops, and dipping it in the pitch-pot, he
and his man threw it among them so plentifully, that, in short,
of all the men in the three boats there was not one that was not
scalded and burnt with it in a most frightful and pitiful manner,
and made such a howling and crying, that I never heard a worse
noise, and, indeed, nothing like it; for it is worth observing,
that though pain naturally makes all people cry out, yet every
nation has a particular way of exclamation, and making noises
as different from one another as their speech. I cannot give the
noise these creatures made a better name than howling, nor a
name more proper to the tone of it; for I never heard anything
more like the noise of the wolves which, as I have said, I heard
howl in the forest on the frontiers of Languedoc.
All the while this was doing, my partner and I, who
managed the rest of the men on board, had with great dexerity
brought the ship almost to rights; and having gotten the guns
into their places again, the gunner called to me to bid our boat
get out of the way, for he would let fly among them. I called
back again to him, and bid him not offer to fire, for the
carpenter would do the work without him, but bade him heat
another pitch-kettle, which our cook, who was on board, took
care of. But the enemy was so terrified with what they had
met with in their first attack, that they would not come on
again; and some of them that were farthest off seeing the ship
swim, as it were, upright, begun, as we supposed, to see their
mistake, and give over the enterprise, finding it was not as they
expected. Thus we got clear of this merry fight; and having
gotten some rice and some roots and bread, with about sixteen
good big hogs on board two days before, we resolved to stay
here no longer, but go forward whatever came of it; for we
made no doubt but we should be surrounded the next day with
rogues enough, perhaps more than our pitch-kettle would
dispose of for us.
We therefore got all our things on board the same evening,
and the next morning were ready to sail. In the meantime,
lying at an anchor at some distance, we were not so much
concerned, being now in a fighting posture, as well as in a
sailing posture, if any enemy had presented. The next day,
having finished our work within board, and finding our ship
was perfectly healed of all her leaks, we set sail. We would
have gone into the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to inform
ourselves of what was to be known concerning the Dutch ships
that had been there; but we durst not stand in there, because
we had seen several ships go in, as we supposed, but a little
before; so we kept on N.E. towards the Isle of Formosa, as
much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or English merchant-
ship, as a Dutch or English merchant-ship in the Mediterranean
is of an Algerine man-of-war.
From Formosa we sailed still north, keeping the coast of
China at an equal distance, till we knew we were beyond all
the ports of China where our European ships usually come;
being resolved, if possible, not to fall into any of their hands,
especially in this country, where, as our circumstances were, we
could not fail of being entirely ruined; nay, so great was my
fear in particular as to my being taken by them, that I believe
firmly I would much rather have chosen to fall into the hands
of the Spanish Inquisition.
Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we resolved
to put into the first trading port we should come at, and stand-
ing in for the shore a boat came off two leagues to us, with an
old Portuguese pilot on board, who, knowing us to be an
European ship, came to offer his service, which indeed we were
very glad of, and took him on board; upon which, without
asking us whither we would go, he dismissed the boat he came
in, and sent them back.
I thought it was now so much in our choice to make the old
man carry us whither we would, that I began to talk with him
about carrying us to the Gulf of Nanking, which is the most
northern part of the coast of China. The old man said he
knew the Gulf of Nanking very well; but smiling, asked us
what we would do there?
I told him we would sell our cargo, and purchase China
wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks, &c., and so would
return by the same course we came. He told us our best port
had been to have put in at Macao, where we could not have

A BOAT CAME OFF.
failed of a market for opium to our satisfaction, and might, for
our money, have purchased all sorts of China goods as cheap
as we could at Nanking.
Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, of which
he was very opinionated, or conceited, I told him we were
gentlemen as well as merchants, and that we had a mind to go
and see the great city of Peking, and the famous court of the
monarch of China. "Why then," says the old man, "you
should go to Ningpo, where, by the river which runs into the
sea there, you may go up within five leagues of the great canal.
This canal is a navigable river, which goes through the heart
of all that vast empire of China, crosses all the rivers, passes
some considerable hills by the help of sluices and gates, and
goes up to the city of Peking, being in length near two hundred
and seventy leagues."
"WeiI,"said I, "Seignior Portuguese, but that is not our
business now; the great question is, if you can carry us up to
the city of Nanking, from whence we can travel to Peking
afterwards?" Yes, he said he could do so very well, and that
there was a great Dutch ship gone by that way just before.
This gave me a little shock; a Dutch ship was now our terror,
and we had much rather have met the devil, at least if he had
not come in too frightful a figure, and we depended upon it
that a Dutch ship would be our destruction, for we were in no
condition to fight them, all the ships they trade with into those
parts being of great burden, and of much greater force than
we were.
The old man found me a little confused, and under some
concern when he named a Dutch ship, and said to me, "Sir,
you need be under no apprehensions of the Dutch; I suppose
they are not now at war with your nation ?"—" No," says I,
"that's true; but I know not what liberties men may take
when they are out of the reach of the law."—" Why," says he,
"you are no pirates, what need you fear? They will not
meddle with peaceable merchants, sure."
If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up into my
face at that word, it was hindered by some stop in the vessels
appointed by Nature to prevent it; for it put me into the
greatest disorder and confusion imaginable; nor was it possible
for me to conceal it so but that the old man easily perceived
it.
"Sir," says he, " I find you are in some disorder in your
thoughts at my talk; pray be pleased to go which way you
think fit, and depend upon it I'll do you all the service I can."
—"Why, seignior," said I, " it is true I am a little unsettled in
my resolution at this time whither to go in particular, and I
am something more so for what you said about pirates. I
hope there are no pirates in these seas; we are but in an ill
condition to meet with them, for you see we have but a small
force, and but very weakly manned."
"Oh, sir," says he, " do not be concerned; I do not know
that there has been any pirates in these seas these fifteen years,
except one, which was seen, as I hear, in the bay of Siam, about
a month since; but you may be assured she is gone to the
southward; nor was she a ship of any great force, or fit for the
work; she was not built for a privateer, but was run away with
by a reprobate crew that were on board, after the captain and
some of his men had been murdered by the Malayans at or
near the island of Sumatra."
"What!" said I, seeming to know nothing of the matter,
"did they murder the captain ?"—" No," said he, " I do not
understand that they murdered him; but as they afterwards
ran away with the ship, it is generally believed they betrayed
him into the hands of the Malayans, who did murder him, and,
perhaps, they procured them to do it."—"Why then," said I,
"they deserve death as much as if they had done it themselves."
—"Nay," says the old man, "they do deserve it, and they will
certainly have it if they light upon any English or Dutch ship,
for they have all agreed together that if they meet that rogue
they will give him no quarter."
"But," said I to him," you say the pirate is gone out of
those seas; how can they meet with him ?"—" Why, that is
true," says he, "they do say so; but he was, as I tell you, in
the bay of Siam, in the river Cambodia, and was discovered
there by some Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, and who
were left on shore when they ran away with her; and some
English and Dutch traders being in the river, they were within
a little of taking him. Nay," said he, " if the foremost boats
had been well seconded by the rest, they had certainly taken
him; but he finding only two boats within reach of him, tacked
about, and fired at these two, and disabled them before the
others came up; and then standing off to sea, the others were
not able to follow him, and so he got away. But they have all
so exact a description of the ship, that they will be sure to
know him; and wherever they find him, they have vowed to
give no quarter to either the captain or the seamen, but to hang
them all up at the yardarm."
"What!" says I, "will they execute them, right or wrong;
hang them first, and judge them afterwards?"—"Oh, sir," says
the old pilot, "there's no need to make a formal business of it
with such rogues as those; let them tie them back to back, and
set them a-diving; it is no more than they richly deserve."
I knew I had my old man fast aboard, and that he could do
me no harm, so that I turned short upon him. "Well now,
seignior," said I, "and this is the very reason why I would have
you carry us up to Nanking, and not to put back to Macao, or
to any other part of the country where the English or Dutch
ships come; for be it known to you, seignior, those captains of
the English and Dutch ships are a parcel of rash, proud,
insolent fellows, that neither know what belongs to justice, or
how to behave themselves as the laws of God and Nature
direct; but being proud of their offices, and not understanding
their power, they would act the murderers to punish robbers;
would take upon them to insult men falsely accused, and
determine them guilty without due inquiry, and perhaps I may
live to call some of them to an account for it, where they may
be taught how justice is to be executed, and that no man ought
to be treated as a criminal till some evidence may be had of the
crime, and that he is the man."
With this I told him that this was the very ship they
attacked, and gave him a full account of the skirmish we had
with their boats, and how foolishly and coward-like they
behaved. I told him all the story of our buying the ship, and
how the Dutchmen served us. I told him the reasons I had to
believe that this story of killing the master by the Malayans
was not true, as also the running away with the ship; but that
it was all a fiction of their own to suggest that the men were
turned pirates; and they ought to have been sure it was so
before they had ventured to attack us by surprise, and oblige
us to resist them; adding, that they would have the blood of
those men whom we killed there in our just defence to answer for.
The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us we
were very much in the right to go away to the north, and that
if he might advise us, it should be to sell the ship in China,
which we might very well do, and buy or build another in the
country; "and," said he, "though you will not get so good a
ship, yet you may get one able enough to carry you and all
your goods back again to Bengal, or anywhere else."
I told him I would take his advice when I came to any port
where I could find a ship for my turn, or get any customer to
buy this. He replied, I should meet with customers enough for
the ship at Nanking, and that a Chinese junk would serve me
very well to go back again; and that he would procure me
people both to buy one and sell the other.
"Well, but, seignior," says I, "as you say they know the
ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your measures, be
instrumental to bring some honest innocent man into a terrible
2 D
broil, and perhaps to be murdered in cold blood; for wherever
they find the ship they will prove the guilt upon the men by
proving this was the ship, and so innocent men may probably
be overpowered and murdered."—" Why," says the old man,
"I will find out a way to prevent that also; for as I know all
those commanders you speak of very well, and shall see them
all as they pass by, I will be sure to set them to rights in the
thing, and let them know that they had been so much in the
wrong, that though the people who were on board at first might
run away with the ship, yet it was not true that they had turned
pirates; and that in particular these were not the men that first
went off with the ship, but innocently bought her for their
trade; and I am persuaded they will so far believe me as at least
to act more cautiously for the time to come."—" Well," says I,
"and will you deliver one message to them from me ?"—" Yes, I
will," says he, "if you will give it under your hand in writing,
that I may be able to prove that it came from you, and not out
of my own head." I answered that I would readily give it
him under my hand; so I took a pen and ink and paper, and
wrote at large the story of assaulting me with the longboats,
&c., the pretended reason of it, and the unjust cruel design of it,
and concluded to the commanders that they had done what
they not only should have been ashamed of, but also that if ever
they came to England, and I lived to see them there, they
should all pay dearly for it if the laws of my country were not
grown out of use before I arrived there.
My old pilot read this over and over again, and asked me
several times if I would stand to it. I answered, I would stand
to it as long as I had anything left in the world, being sensible
that I should one time or other find an opportunity to put it
home to them. But we had no occasion ever to let the pilot
carry this letter, for he never went back again. While those
things were passing between us by way of discourse, we went
forward directly for Nanking, and in about thirteen days' sail
came to an anchor at the south-west point of the great Gulf of
Nanking; where, by the way, I came by accident to understand
that two Dutch ships were gone the length before me, and that
I should certainly fall into their hands. I consulted my partner
again in this exigency, and he was as much at a loss as I was,
and would very gladly have been safe on shore almost anywhere.
However, I was not in such perplexity neither, but I asked the
old pilot if there was no creek or harbour which I might put
into, and pursue my business with the Chinese privately, and
be in no danger of the enemy. He told me if I would sail to
the southward about two and forty leagues there was a little port
called Quinchang, where the fathers of the mission usually
landed from Macao on their progress to teach the Christian
religion to the Chinese, and where no European ships ever put
in; and if I thought to put in there, I might consider what
farther course to take when I was ashore. He confessed, he
said, it was not a place for merchants, except that at some
certain times they had a kind of a fair there, when the merchants
from Japan came over to buy the Chinese merchandises.
We all agreed to go back to this place; the name of the port,
as he called it, I may, perhaps, spell wrong, for I do not
particularly remember it, having lost this together with the
names of many other places set down in a little pocket-book,
which was spoiled by the water, on an accident, which I shall
relate in its order; but this I remember, that the Chinese or
Japanese merchants we corresponded with called it by a differing
name from that which our Portuguese pilot gave it, and pro-
nounced it, as above, Quinchang.
As we were unanimous in our resolutions to go to this place,
we weighed the next day, having only gone twice ashore, where
we were to get fresh water; on both which occasions the people
of the country were very civil to us, and brought us abundance
of things to sell to us; I mean of provisions, plants, roots, tea,
rice, and some fowls; but nothing without money.
We came to the other port (the wind being contrary) not till
five days; but it was very much to our satisfaction, and I
was joyful, and I may say thankful, when I set my foot safe on
shore, resolving, and my partner too, that if it was possible to
dispose of ourselves and effects any other way, though not every
way to our satisfaction, we would never set one foot on board that
unhappy vessel more; and indeed I must acknowledge, that of
all the circumstances of life that ever I had any experience of,
nothing makes mankind so completely miserable as that of being
in constant fear.
Both my partner and I scarce slept a night without dreaming
of halters and yard-arms, that is to say, gibbets; of fighting, and
being taken; of killing, and being killed; and one night I was
in such a fury in my dream, fancying the Dutchmen had boarded
us, and I was knocking one of their seamen down, that I struck
my double fist against the side of the cabin I lay in with such
a force as wounded my hand most grievously, broke my
knuckles, and cut and bruised the flesh, so that it not only
waked me out of my sleep, but I was once afraid I should have
lost two of my fingers.
Another apprehension I had was, of the cruel usage we
might meet with from them if we fell into their hands; then the
story of Amboyna came into my head, and how the Dutch
might, perhaps, torture us, as they did our countrymen there;
and make some of the men, by extremity of torture, confess
those crimes they never were guilty of; own themselves, and
all of us, to be pirates; and so they would put us to death,
with a formal appearance of justice; and that they might
be tempted to do this for the gain of our ship and cargo,
which was worth four or five thousand pounds, put all
together.
These things tormented me, and my partner too, night and
day; nor did we consider that the captains of ships have no
authority to act thus; and if we had surrendered prisoners to
them, they could not answer the destroying us, or torturing us,
but would be accountable for it when they came into their own
country. This, I say, gave me no satisfaction; for if they will
act thus with us, what advantage would it be to us that they
would be called to an account for it; or if we were first to be
murdered, what satisfaction would it be to us to have them
punished when they came home?
By how much the greater weight the anxieties and per-
plexities of these things were to our thoughts while we were
at sea, by so much the greater was our satisfaction when we saw
ourselves on shore; and my partner told me he dreamed that
he had a very heavy load upon his back, which he was to carry
up a hill, and found that he was not able to stand long under it,
but that the Portuguese pilot came and took it off his back,
and the hill disappeared, the ground before him showing all
smooth and plain; and truly it was so; we were all like men
who had a load taken off their backs.
For my part, I had a weight taken off from my heart that I
was not able any longer to bear; and, as I said above, we
resolved to go no more to sea in that ship. When we came on
shore, the old pilot, who was now our friend, got us a lodging,
and a warehouse for our goods, which, by the way, was much
the same. It was a little house, or hut, with a large house join-
ing to it, all built with canes, and palisadoed round with large
canes to keep out pilfering thieves, of which, it seems, there
were not a few in that country. However, the magistrates
allowed us also a little guard, and we had a sentinel with a
kind of halberd, or half pike, who stood sentinel at our door, to
whom we allowed a pint of rice and a little piece of money,
about the value of threepence, per day; so that our goods were
kept very safe.
The fair or mart usually kept in this place had been over
some time; however, we found that there were three or four
junks in the river, and two Japanners (I mean ships from Japan),
with goods which they had bought in China, and were not gone
away, having Japanese merchants on shore.
The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us was to
bring us acquainted with three missionary Romish priests who
were in the town, and who had been there some time converting
the people to Christianity; but we thought they made but poor
work of it, and made them but sorry Christians when they had
done. However, that was none of our business. One of these
was a Frenchman, whom they called Father Simon. He was a
jolly, well-conditioned man, very free in his conversation, not
seeming so serious and grave as the other two did, one of whom
was a Portuguese, and the other a Genoese; but Father Simon
was courteous, easy in his manner, and very agreeable company;
the other two were more reserved, seemed rigid and austere,
and applied seriously to the work they came about, viz., to
talk with, and insinuate themselves among, the inhabitants
wherever they had opportunity.
This French priest, Father Simon, was appointed, it seems,
by order of the chief of the mission to go up to Peking, the royal
seat of the Chinese emperor, and waited only for another priest,
who was ordered to come to him from Macao to go along with
him; and we scarce ever met together but he was inviting me
to go that journey, telling me how he would show me all the
glorious things of that mighty empire, and among the rest the
greatest city in the world; a city, said he, that your London
and our Paris, put together, cannot be equal to. This was the
city of Peking, which, I confess, is very great, and infinitely full
of people; but as I looked on those things with different eyes
from other men, so I shall give my opinion of them in few
words when I come in the course of my travels to speak more
particularly of them.
But first I come to my friar or missionary. Dining with him
one day, and being very merry together, I showed some little
inclination to go with him; and he pressed me and my partner
very hard, and with a great many persuasions, to consent.
"Why, Father Simon," says my partner, "why should you
desire our company so much? You know we are heretics, and
you do not love us, nor cannot keep us company with any
pleasure."—" Oh!" says he, "you may, perhaps, be good
Catholics in time; my business here is to convert heathens, and
who knows but I may convert you too ?"—" Very well, father,"
said I, " so you will preach to us all the way."—" I won't be
troublesome to you," says he; "our religion does not divest
us of good manners; besides," says he, "we are here like
countrymen; and so we are, compared to the place we are in;
and if you are Huguenots, and I a Catholic, we may be all
Christians at last; at least," said he, "we are all gentlemen,
and we may converse so without being uneasy to one another."
I liked that part of his discourse very well, and it began to put
me in mind of my priest that I had left in the Brazils; but this
Father Simon did not come up to his character by a great deal;
for though Father Simon had no appearance of a criminal levity
in him neither, yet he had not that fund of Christian zeal, strict
piety, and sincere affection to religion that my other good
ecclesiastic had, of whom I have said so much.
But to leave him a little, though he never left us, nor solicit-
ing us to go with him, but we had something else before us
at first; for we had all this while our ship and our
merchandise to dispose of; and we began to be very doubtful
"CAME WITH ONE OFTHE MISSIONARY PRIESTS"
what we should do, for we were now in a place of very little
business; and once I was about to venture to sail for the river
of Kilam and the city of Nanking; but Providence seemed now
more visibly, as I thought, than ever to concern itself in our
affair; and the first thing that offered was, that our old
Portuguese pilot brought a Japan merchant to us, who began to
inquire what goods we had; and, in the first place, he bought
all our opium, and gave us a very good price for it, paying us in
gold by weight, some in small pieces of their own coin, and
some in small wedges, of about ten or eleven ounces each.
While we were dealing with him for our opium, it came into my
head that he might, perhaps, deal with us for the ship too; and
I ordered the interpreter to propose it to him. He shrunk up
his shoulders at it when it was first proposed to him; but in a
few days after he came to me, with one of the missionary priests
for his interpreter, and told me he had a proposal to make to
me, and that was this : he had bought a great quantity of goods
of us when he had no thoughts, or proposals made to him, of
buying the ship, and that, therefore, he had not money enough
to pay for the ship; but if I would let the same men who
were in the ship navigate her, he would hire the ship to go to
Japan, and would send them from thence to the Philippine
Islands with another loading, which he would pay the freight
of before they went from Japan; and that, at their return, he
would buy the ship. I began to listen to his proposals; and so
eager did my head still run upon rambling, that I could not but
begin to entertain a notion of going myself with him, and to
sail from the Philippine Islands away to the South Seas ; and ac-
cordingly I asked the Japan merchant if he would not hire
us to the Philippine Islands, and discharge us there. He said
no, he could not do that, for then he could not have the return
of his cargo; but he would discharge us in Japan, he said, at the
ship's return. Well, still I was for taking him at that proposal,
and going myself; but my partner, wiser than myself, persuaded
me from it, representing the dangers as well of the seas as of the
Japanese, who are a false, cruel, and treacherous people; and
then of the Spaniards at the Philippines, more false, more cruel,
and more treacherous than they.
But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a conclusion.
The first thing we had to do was to consult with the captain of
the ship and with his men, and know if they were willing to go
to Japan; and while I was doing this, the young man whom, as
I said, my nephew had left with me as my companion for my
travels, came to me, and told me that he thought that voyage
promised very fair, and that there was a great prospect of
advantage, and he would be very glad if I undertook it; but
that if I would not, and would give him leave, he would go as a
merchant, or how I pleased to order him; that if ever he came
to England, and I was there, and alive, he would render me a
faithful account of his success, and it should be as much mine
as I pleased.
I was really loath to part with him ; but considering the
prospect of advantage, which was really considerable, and that
he was a young fellow as likely to do well in it as any I knew,
I inclined to let him go; but first I told him I would consult
my partner, and give him an answer the next day. My partner
and I discoursed about it, and my partner made a most
generous offer. He told me, "You know it has been an un-
lucky ship, and we both resolved not to go to sea in it again;
if your steward (so he called my man) will venture the voyage,
I'll leave my share of the vessel to him, and let him make his
best of it; and if we live to meet in England, and he meets
with success abroad, he shall account for one-half of the profits
of the ship's freight to us, the other shall be his own."
If my partner, who was no way concerned with my young
man, made him such an offer, I could do no less than offer him
the same; and all the ship's company being willing to go with
him, we made over half the ship to him in property, and took a
writing from him, obliging him to account for the other; and
away he went to Japan. The Japan merchant proved a very
punctual honest man to him, protected him at Japan, and got
him a licence to come on shore, which the Europeans in general
have not lately obtained, paid him his freight very punctually,
sent him to the Philippines, loaded with Japan and China
wares, and a supercargo of their own, who trafficking with the
Spaniards brought back European goods again, and a great
quantity of cloves and other spices; and there he was not only
paid his freight very well, and at a very good price, but being
not willing to sell the ship then, the merchant furnished him
with goods on his own account; that for some money and some
spices of his own, which he brought with him, he went back to
the Manillas, to the Spaniards, where he sold his cargo very
well. Here having gotten a good acquaintance at Manilla, he
got his ship made a free ship; and the governor of Manilla hired
him to go to Acapulco, in America, on the coast of Mexico;
and gave him a licence to land there, and travel to Mexico;
and to pass in any Spanish ship to Europe, with all his men.
He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and there
he sold his ship; and having there also obtained allowance to
travel by land to Porto Bello, he found means somehow or
other to get to Jamaica with all his treasure, and about eight
years after came to England exceeding rich, of the which I
shall take notice in its place; in the meantime, I return to our
particular affairs.
Being now to part with the ship and ship's company, it
came before us, of course, to consider what recompense we should
give to the two men that they gave us such timely notice of the
design against us in the river of Cambodia. The truth was,
that they had done us a considerable service, and deserved well at
our hands, though, by the way, they were a couple of rogues
too; for as they believed the story of our being pirates, and
that we had really run away with the ship, they came down to
us not only to betray the design that was formed against us,
but to go to sea with us as pirates; and one of them confessed
afterwards that nothing else but the hopes of going a-roguing
brought him to do it. However, the service they did us was
not the less; and therefore, as I had promised to be grateful to
them, I first ordered the money to be paid to them which they
said was due to them on board their respective ships; that is to
say, the Englishman nineteen months' pay, and to the
Dutchman seven; and over and above that I gave them, each
of them, a small sum of money in gold, and which contented
them very well. Then I made the Englishman gunner in the
ship, the gunner being now made second mate and purser; the
Dutchman I made boatswain; so they were both very well
pleased, and proved very serviceable, being both able seamen,
and very stout fellows.
We were now on shore in China. If I thought myself
banished and remote from my own country at Bengal, where I
had many ways to get home for my money, what could I think
of myself now, when I was gotten about a thousand leagues
farther off from home, and perfectly destitute of all manner
of prospect of return?
All we had for it was this, that in about four months' time
there was to be another fair at the place where we were, and
then we might be able to purchase all sorts of the manufactures
of the country, and withal might possibly find some Chinese
junks or vessels from Tonquin that would be to be sold, and would
carry us and our goods whither we pleased. This I liked very
well, and resolved to wait; besides, as our particular persons
were not obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch ships came
thither, perhaps we might have an opportunity to load our
goods, and get passage to some other place in India nearer
home.
Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here; but to
divert ourselves we took two or three journeys into the country.
First, we went ten days' journey to see the city of Nanking, a
city well worth seeing indeed; they say it has a million of
people in it, which, however, I do not believe. It is regularly
built, the streets all exactly straight, and cross one another in
direct lines, which gives the figure of it great advantage.
But when I come to compare the miserable people of these
countries with ours, their fabrics, their manner of living, their
government, their religion, their wealth, and their glory, as some
call it, I must confess I do not so much as think it is worth
naming, or worth my while to write of, or any that shall come
after me to read.
As their strength and their grandeur, so their navigation,
commerce, and husbandry is imperfect and impotent compared
to the same things in Europe. Also in their knowledge, their
learning, their skill in the sciences; they have globes and
spheres, and a smatch of the knowledge of the mathematics;
but when you come to inquire into their knowledge, how short-
sighted are the wisest of their students! They know nothing
of the motion of the heavenly bodies; and so grossly, absurdly
ignorant, that when the sun is eclipsed they think 'tis a great
dragon has assaulted and run away with it, and they fall
a-clattering with all the drums and kettles in the country to
fright the monster away, just as we do to hive a swarm of
bees.
I had, indeed, a mind to see the city of Peking, which I had
heard so much of, and Father Simon importuned me daily to
do it. At length his time of going away being set, and the
other missionary, who was to go with him, being arrived from
Macao, it was necessary that we should resolve either to go, or
not to go; so I referred him to my partner, and left it wholly
to his choice, who at length resolved it in the affirmative, and
we prepared for our journey.
We set out with very good advantage as to finding the way;
for we got leave to travel in the retinue of one of their mandarins,
a kind of viceroy, or principal magistrate, in the province where
they reside, and who take great state upon them, travelling with
great attendance, and with great homage from the people, who
are sometimes greatly impoverished by them, because all the
countries they pass through are obliged to furnish provisions for
them, and all their attendance. That which I particularly
observed as to our travelling with his baggage, was this, that
though we received sufficient provisions, both for ourselves and
our horses, from the country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet
we were obliged to pay for everything we had after the market-
price of the country, and the mandarin's steward, or commissary
of the provisions, collected it duly from us; so that our travel-
ling in the retinue of the mandarin, though it was a very great
kindness to us, was not such a mighty favour in him, but was,
indeed, a great advantage to him, considering there were above
thirty other people travelled in the same manner besides us,
under the protection of his retinue, or, as we may call it, under
his convoy; this, I say, was a great advantage to him, for the
country furnished all the provisions for nothing, and he took all
our money for them.
We were five and twenty days travelling to Peking, through
a country infinitely populous, but miserably cultivated; the
husbandry, the economy, and the way of living miserable,
though they boast so much of the industry of the people; I say
miserable; and so it is, if we, who understand how to live, were
to endure it, or to compare it with our own; but not so to these
poor wretches, who know no other. The pride of these people
is infinitely great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty,
which adds to that which I call their misery; and I must needs
think the naked savages of America live much more happy,
because, as they have nothing, so they desire nothing; whereas
these are proud and insolent, and, in the main, are mere beggars
and drudges; their ostentation is inexpressible, and is chiefly
showed in their clothes and buildings, and in keeping multitudes
of servants or slaves; and which is to the last degree ridiculous,
their contempt of all the world but themselves.
I must confess I travelled more pleasantly afterwards in the
deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartary than here; and
yet the roads here are well paved and well kept, and very con-
venient for travellers; but nothing was more awkward to me
than to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent people in the
midst of the grossest simplicity and ignorance, for all their
famed ingenuity is no more; and my friend Father Simon and
I used to be very merry upon these occasions to see the beggarly
pride of those people. For example, coming by the house of a
country gentleman, as Father Simon called him, about ten
leagues off of the city of Nanking, we had, first of all, the honour
to ride with the master of the house about two miles; the state
he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being a mixture of
pomp and poverty.
The habit of this greasy Don was very proper for a
scaramouch or merry-andrew, being a dirty calico, with all the
tawdry and trapping of a fool's coat, such as hanging sleeves,
tassels, and cuts and slashes almost on every side; it covered a
taffeta vest, as greasy as a butcher, and which testified that his
honour must needs be a most exquisite sloven. His horse was
a poor, lean, starved, hobbling creature, such as in England
might sell for about thirty or forty shillings; and he had two
slaves followed him on foot, to drive the poor creature along.
He had a whip in his hand, and he belaboured the beast as fast
about the head as his slaves did about the tail; and thus he rode
by us with about ten or twelve servants; and we were told he
was going from the city to his country seat, about half a league
before us. We travelled on gently, but this figure of a gentle-

HE WAS LOLLING BACK IN A GREAT ELBOW-CHAIR, BEING A HEAVY, CORPULENT MAN.
man rode away before us, and we stopped at a village about an
hour to refresh us.
When we came by the country seat of this great man, we
saw him in a little place before his door, eating his repast. It
was a kind of a garden, but he was easy to be seen; and we
were given to understand that the more we looked on him, the
better he would be pleased. He sat under a tree, something
like the palmetto-tree, which effectually shaded him over the
head, and on the south side; but under the tree also was placed
a large umbrella, which made that part look well enough. He
sat lolling back in a great elbow-chair, being a heavy, corpulent
man, and his meat being brought him by two women slaves.
He had two more, whose office, I think, few gentlemen in
Europe would accept of their service in, viz., one fed the squire
with a spoon, and the other held the dish with one hand, and
scraped off what he let fall upon his worship's beard and taffeta
vest; while the great fat brute thought it below him to employ
his own hands in any of those familiar offices which kings and
monarchs would rather do than be troubled with the clumsy
fingers of their servants.
As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, he was
respected like a king; surrounded always with his gentlemen,
and attended in all his appearances with such pomp, that I
saw little of him but at a distance; but this I observed, that
there was not a horse in his retinue but that our carriers' pack-
horses in England seem to me to look much better; but they
were so covered with equipage, mantles, trappings, and such
like trumpery, that you cannot see whether they are fat or
lean; in a word, we could see scarce anything but their feet
and their heads.
I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and perplexity
that I had given an account of being over, I had no anxious
thoughts about me, which made this journey the pleasanter to
me; nor had I any ill accident attended me, only in the passing
or fording a small river my horse fell, and made me free of the
country, as they call it; that is to say, threw me in. The place
was not deep, but it wetted me all over. I mention it, because
it spoiled my pocket-book, wherein I had set down the names
of several people and places which I had occasion to remember,
and which, not taking due care of, the leaves rotted, and the
words were never after to be read, to my great loss as to the
names of some places I touched at in this voyage.
At length we arrived at Peking. I had nobody with me
but the youth, whom my nephew, the captain, had given me to
attend me as a servant, and who proved very trusty and
diligent; and my partner had nobody with him but one servant,
who was a kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being
desirous to see the court, we gave him his passage, that is to
say, bore his charges for his company, and to use him as an
interpreter, for he understood the language of the country, and
spoke good French and a little English; and, indeed, this old
man was a most useful implement to us everywhere; for we
had not been above a week at Peking, when he came laughing.
"Ah, seignior Inglese," says he, " I have something to tell you
will make your heart glad."—" My heart glad," says I, " what
can that be? I don't know anything in this country can either
give me joy or grief, to any great degree."—" Yes, yes," said
the old man in broken English, "make you glad, me sorrow ;"
sorry, he would have said. This made me more inquisitive.
"Why," said I, " will it make you sorry? "—" Because," said he,
"you have brought me here twenty-five days'journey, and will
leave me to go back alone; and which way shall I get to my
port afterwards, without a ship, without a horse, without
pecune?" so he called money; being his broken Latin, of
which he had abundance to make us merry with.
In short, he told us there was a great caravan of Muscovite
and Polish merchants in the city, and they were preparing to
set out on their journey, by land, to Muscovy within four or
five weeks, and he was sure we would take the opportunity to
go with them, and leave him behind to go back all alone. I
confess I was surprised with his news. A secret joy spread
itself over my whole soul, which I cannot describe, and never
felt before or since; and I had no power, for a good while, to
speak a word to the old man; but at last I turned to him.
"How do you know this ?" said I; "are you sure it is true?"
—" Yes," says he, " I met this morning in the street an old
acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, or one you call a Grecian,
who is among them; he came last from Astrakhan, and was
designing to go to Tonquin, where I formerly knew him, but
has altered his mind, and is now resolved to go with the
caravan to Moscow, and so down the river Volga to Astrakhan."
—" Well, seignior," says I, " do not be uneasy about being left
to go back alone. If this be a method for my return to
England, it shall be your fault if you go back to Macao at all."
We then went to consulting together what was to be done, and
I asked my partner what he thought of the pilot's news, and
whether it would suit with his affairs. He told me he would
do just as I would; for he had settled all his affairs so well at
Bengal, and left his effects in such good hands, that as we had
made a good voyage here, if he could vest it in China silks,
wrought and raw, such as might be worth the carriage, he
would be content to go to England, and then make his voyage
back to Bengal by the Company's ships.
Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our Portugal
pilot would go with us we would bear his charges to Moscow,
or to England if he pleased; nor, indeed, were we to be
esteemed over-generous in that part neither, if we had not
rewarded him farther; for the service he had done us was really
worth all that, and more; for he had not only been a pilot to us
at sea, but he had been like a broker for us on shore; and his
procuring for us the Japan merchant was some hundreds of
pounds in our pocket. So we consulted together about it; and
being willing to gratify him, which was indeed but doing him
justice, and very willing also to have him with us besides, for
he was a most necessary man on all occasions, we agreed to
give him a quantity of coined gold, which, as I compute it,
came to about £175 sterling between us, and to bear all his
charges, both for himself and horse, except only a horse to
carry his goods.
Having settled this among ourselves, we called him to let
him know what we had resolved. I told him he had com-
plained of our being to let him go back alone, and I was now
to tell him we were resolved he should not go back at all; that
as we had resolved to go to Europe with the caravan, we
resolved also he should go with us, and that we called him to
know his mind. He shook his head, and said it was a long
journey, and he had no pecune to carry him thither, or to
subsist himself when he came there. We told him we believed
it was so, and therefore we had resolved to do something for
him that should let him see how sensible we were of the service
he had done us, and also how agreeable he was to us; and
then I told him what we had resolved to give him here, which
he might lay out as we would do our own ; and that as for his
charges, if he would go with us, we would set him safe ashore,
life and casualties excepted, either in Muscovy or England,
which he would, at our own charge, except only the carriage
of his goods.
He received the proposal like a man transported, and told
us he would go with us over the whole world ; and so, in short,
we all prepared ourselves for the journey. However, as it was
with us, so it was with the other merchants; they had many-
things to do, and instead of being ready in five weeks, it was four
months and some odd days before all things were got together.
It was the beginning of February, our style, when we set
out from Peking. My partner and the old pilot had gone
express back to the port where we had first put in, to dispose
of some goods which we had left there; and I, with a Chinese
merchant, whom I had some knowledge of at Nanking, and
who came to Peking on his own affairs, went to Nanking, where
I bought ninety pieces of fine damasks, with about two hundred
pieces of other very fine silks, of several sorts, some mixed with
gold, and had all these brought to Peking against my partner's
return. Besides this, we bought a very large quantity of raw
silk, and some other goods; our cargo amounting, in these
goods only, to about three thousand five hundred pounds
sterling, which, together with tea, and some fine calicoes, and
three camels' loads of nutmegs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen
camels for our share, besides those we rode upon; which, with
two or three spare horses, and two horses loaded with provisions,
made us, in short, twenty-six camels and horses in our retinue.
The company was very great, and, as near as I can
remember, made between three and four hundred horse, and
upwards of a hundred and twenty men, very well armed, and
provided for all events; for, as the eastern caravans are
subjected to be attacked by the Arabs, so are these by the
Tartars; but they are not altogether so dangerous as the
Arabs, nor so barbarous when they prevail.
The company consisted of people of several nations, such
as Muscovites chiefly; for there were above sixty of them who
were merchants or inhabitants of Moscow, though of them
some were Livonians ; and to our particular satisfaction, five
of them were Scots, who appeared also to be men of great
experience in business, and men of very good substance.
When we had travelled one day's journey, the guides, who
were five in number, called all the gentlemen and merchants,
that is to say, all the passengers, except the servants, to a great
council, as they called it. At this great council every one de-
posited a certain quantity of money to a common stock for the
necessary expense of buying forage on the way, where it was
not otherwise to be had, and for satisfying the guides, get-
ting horses, and the like. And here they constituted the journey,
as they call it, viz., they named captains and officers, to draw
us all up, and give the command in case of an attack, and gave
2E
everyone their turn of command; nor was this forming us into
order any more than what we found needful upon the way, as
shall be observed in its place.
The road all on this side of the country is very populous,
and is full of potters and earth makers; that is to say, people
that tempered the earth for the China ware; and as I was
coming along, our Portugal pilot, who had always something
or other to say to make us merry, came sneering to me, and
told me he would show me the greatest rarity in all the
country; and that I should have this to say of China, after all
the ill-humoured things I had said of it, that I had seen one
thing which was not to be seen in all the world beside. I was
very importunate to know what it was. At last he told me it
was a gentleman's house, built all with China ware. "Well,"
says I, " are not the materials of their building the product of
their own country; and so is all China ware, is it not ?"—" No,
no," says he, "I mean it is an house all made of China ware,
such as you call it in England; or, as it is called in our country,
porcelain."—" Well," says I, "such a thing may be; how big is
it? can we carry it in a box upon a camel? If we can, we will
buy it."—" Upon a camel!" says the old pilot, holding up both
his hands; "why, there is a family of thirty people in it."
I was then curious, indeed, to see it; and when I came to it,
it was nothing but this: it was a timber house, or a house built,
as we call it in England, with lath and plaster, but all the
plastering was really China ware, that is to say, it was plastered
with the earth that makes China ware.
The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and
looked very well, perfect white, and painted with blue figures,
as the large China ware in England is painted, and hard, as if
it had been burnt. As to the inside, all the walls, instead of
wainscot, were lined up with hardened and painted tiles, like
the little square tiles we call galley tiles in England, all made
of the finest china, and the figures exceeding fine indeed, with
extraordinary variety of colours, mixed with gold, many tiles
making but one figure, but joined so artificially, the mortar
being made of the same earth, that it was very hard to see
where the tiles met. The floors of the rooms were of the same
composition, and as hard as the earthen floors we have in use
in several parts of England, especially Lincolnshire, Nottingham-
shire, Leicestershire, &c., as hard as a stone, and smooth, but
not burnt and painted, except some smaller rooms, like closets,
which were all, as it were, paved with the same tile; the ceiling
and, in a word, all the plastering work in the whole house were
of the same earth; and, after all, the roof was covered with
tiles of the same, but of a deep shining black.
This was a china warehouse indeed, truly and literally to
be called so; and had I not been upon the journey, I could
have stayed some days to see and examine the particulars of
it. They told me there were fountains and fish-ponds in the
garden, all paved at the bottom and sides with the same, and
fine statues set up in rows on the walks, entirely formed of the
porcelain earth, and burnt whole.
As this is one of the singularities of China, so they may be
allowed to excel in it; but I am very sure they excel in their
accounts of it, for they told me such incredible things of their
performance in crockery-ware, for such it is, that I care not to
relate, as knowing it could not be true. They told me, in
particular, of one workman that made a ship, with all its tackle,
and masts, and sails, in earthenware, big enough to carry fifty
men. If he had told me he launched it, and made a voyage to
Japan in it, I might have said something to it indeed; but as
it was, I knew the whole of the story, which was, in short, ask-
ing pardon for the word, that the fellow lied; so I smiled, and
said nothing to it.
This odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan, for
which the leader of it for the day fined me about the value of
three shillings; and told me, if it had been three days' journey
without the wall, as it was three days within, he must have
fined me four times as much, and made me ask pardon the
next council day; so I promised to be more orderly; for,
indeed, I found afterward the orders made for keeping all
together were absolutely necessary for our common safety.
In two days more we passed the great China wall, made for
a fortification against the Tartars; and a very great work it is,
going over hills and mountains in a needless track, where the
rocks are impassable, and the precipices such as no enemy
could possibly enter, or indeed climb up, or where, if they did,
no wall could hinder them. They tell us its length is near a
thousand English miles, but that the country is five hundred in
a straight measured line, which the wall bounds, without
measuring the windings and turnings it takes; 'tis about four
fathoms high, and as many thick in some places.
I stood still an hour, or thereabout, without trespassing our
orders, for so long the caravan was in passing the gate; I say,
I stood still an hour to look at it on every side, near, and far
off; I mean, that was within my view; and the guide of our
caravan, who had been extolling it for the wonder of the world,
was mighty eager to hear my opinion of it. I told him it was a
most excellent thing to keep off the Tartars, which he happened
not to understand as I meant it, and so took it for a compli-
ment; but the old pilot laughed. "O seignior Inglese," says
he, "you speak in colours." "In colours!" said I; "what do
you mean by that?" "Why, you speak what looks white this
way, and black that way—gay one way, and dull another way.
You tell him it is a good wall to keep out Tartars; you tell me,
bythat.it is good for nothing but to keep out Tartars, or it will
keep out none but Tartars. I understand you, seignior Inglese,
I understand you," says he, "but seignior Chinese understood
you his own way."
"Well," says I, "seignior, do you think it would stand out
an army of our country-people, with a good train of artillery, or
our engineers, with two companies of miners? Would not they
batter it down in ten days, that an army might enter in battalia,
or blow it up in the air, foundation and all, that there should be
no sign of it left ? "—" Ah, ah!" says he, "I know that." The
Chinese wanted mightily to know what I said, and I gave him
leave to tell him a few days after, for he was then almost out of
their country, and he was to leave us in a little time afterward;
but when he knew what I had said, he was dumb all the rest of
the way, and we heard no more of his fine story of the Chinese
power and greatness while he stayed.
After we had passed this mighty nothing, called a wall,
something like the Picts' wall, and so famous in Northumber-
land, and built by the Romans, we began to find the country
thinly inhabited, and the people rather confined to live in forti-
fied towns and cities, as being subject to the inroads and de-
predations of the Tartars, who rob in great armies, and there-
fore are not to be resisted by the naked inhabitants of an open
country.
And here I began to find the necessity of keeping together
in a caravan as we travelled, for we saw several troops of
Tartars roving about; but when I came to see them distinctly,
I wondered more that the Chinese Empire could be conquered
by such contemptible fellows; for they are a mere horde or
crowd of wild fellows, keeping no order, and understanding no
discipline, or manner of fight.
Their horses are poor, lean, starved creatures, taught nothing,
and fit for nothing; and this we said the first day we saw them,
which was after we entered the wider part of the country. Our
leader for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us to go a-
hunting, as they call it, and what was this but hunting of sheep?
However, it may be called hunting too; for the creatures are
the wildest and swiftest of foot that ever I saw of their kind,
only they will not run a great way, and you are sure of sport
when you begin the chase, for they appear generally thirty or
forty in a flock, and, li'<e true sheep, always keep together when
they fly.
In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our hap to meet
with about forty Tartars. Whether they were hunting mutton
as we were, or whether they looked for another kind of prey, I
know not; but as soon as they saw us, one of them blew a kind
of horn very loud, but with a barbarous sound that I had never
heard before, and, by the way, never care to hear again. We
all supposed this was to call their friends about them; and so
it was, for in less than half a quarter of an hour a troop of forty
or fifty more appeared at about a mile distance; but our work
was over first, as it happened.
One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to be
amongst us; and as soon as he heard the horn he told us, in
short, that we had nothing to do but to charge them immedi-
ately, without loss of time; and drawing us up in a line, he
asked if we were resolved? We told him we were ready to
follow him; so he rode directly up to them. They stood
gazing at us like a mere crowd, drawn up in no order, nor
showing the face of any order at all; but as soon as they saw
us advance, they let fly their arrows, which, however, missed us
very happily. It seems they mistook not their aim, but their
distance; for their arrows all fell a little short of us, but with
so true an aim, that had we been about twenty yards nearer,
we must have had several men wounded, if not killed.
Immediately we halted; and though it was at a great
distance, we fired, and sent them leaden bullets for wooden
arrows, following our shot full gallop, to fall in among them
sword in hand, for so our bold Scot that led us directed. He
was, indeed, but a merchant, but he behaved with that vigour
and bravery on this occasion, and yet with such a cool courage
too, that I never saw any man in action fitter for command.
As soon as we came up to them we fired our pistols in their
faces, and then drew, but they fled in the greatest confusion
imaginable. The only stand any of them made was on our
right, where three of them stood, and, by signs, called the rest
to come back to them, having a kind of scymitar in their hands,
and their bows hanging at their backs. Our brave commander,
without asking anybody to follow him, gallops up close to them,
and with his fusee knocks one of them off his horse, killed the
second with his pistol, and the third ran away, and thus ended
our fight. But we had this misfortune attending it, viz., that
all our mutton that we had in chase got away. We had not a
man killed or hurt; but as for the Tartars there was about five
of them killed. Who were wounded, we knew not; but this we
knew, that the other party was so frighted with the noise of
our guns, that they made off, and never made any attempt
upon us.
We were all this while in the Chinese dominion, and there-
fore the Tartars were not so bold as afterwards; but in about
five days we entered a vast great wild desert, which held us
three days' and nights' march; and we were obliged to carry
our water with us in great leather bottles, and to encamp all
night, just as I have heard they do in the desert of Arabia.
I asked whose dominion this was in, and they told me this
was a kind of border, that might be called No Man's Land;
being a part of the Great Karakathie, or Grand Tartary, but
that, however, it was all reckoned to China; but that there was
no care taken here to preserve it from the inroads of thieves,
"KILLED THE SECOND WITH HIS PISTOL"
and therefore it was reckoned the worst desert in the whole
world, though we were to go over some much larger.
In passing this wilderness, which, I confess, was at the first
very frightful to me, we saw two or three times little parties
of the Tartars, but they seemed to be upon their own affairs,
and to have no design upon us; and so, like the man who met
the devil, if they had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to
say to them; we let them go.
Once, however, a party of them came so near as to stand
and gaze at us; whether it was to consider what they should
do, whether attack us or not attack us, that we knew not; but
when we were passed at some distance by them, we made a
rearguard of forty men, and stood ready for them, letting the
caravan pass half a mile, or thereabouts, before us; but after a
while they marched off, only we found they saluted us with five
arrows at their parting, one of which wounded a horse so that
it disabled him, and we left him the next day, poor creature, in
great need of a good farrier. We suppose they might shoot
more arrows, which might fall short of us; but we saw no more
arrows, or Tartars, that time.
We travelled near a month after this, the ways being not so
bad as at first, though still in the dominions of the Emperor of
China; but lay, for the most part, in villages, some of which
were fortified because of the incursions of the Tartars. When
we came to one of these towns (it was about two days and a
half journey before we were to come to the city Naum), I
wanted to buy a camel, of which there are plenty to be sold all
the way upon that road, and of horses also, such as they are,
because so many caravans coming that way they are often
wanted. The person that I spoke to to get me a camel would
have gone and fetched it for me, but I, like a fool, must
be officious, and go myself along with him. The place was
about two miles out of the village, where, it seems, they kept
the camels and horses feeding under a guard.
I walked it on foot with my old pilot, being very desirous,
forsooth, of a little variety. When we came to the place it was
a low marshy ground, walled round with a stone wall, piled up
dry, without mortar or earth among it, like a park, with a little
guard of Chinese soldiers at the door. Having bought a camel,
and agreed for the price, I came away; and the Chinese man,
that went with me, led the camel, when on a sudden came up
five Tartars on horseback. Two of them seized the fellow, and
took the camel from him, while the other three stepped up to
me and my old pilot, seeing us, as it were, unarmed; for I had
no weapon about me but my sword, which could but ill defend
me against three horsemen. The first that came up stopped
short upon my drawing my sword (for they are arrant cowards),
but a second coming up on my left gave me a blow on the head,
which I never felt till afterward, and wondered, when I came to
myself, what was the matter with me, and where I was, for he
laid me flat on the ground; but my never-failing old pilot, the
Portuguese, had a pistol in his pocket, which I knew nothing of,
nor the Tartars neither; if they had, I suppose they would not
have attacked us; but cowards are always boldest when there
is no danger.
The old man seeing me down, with a bold heart stepped up
to the fellow that had struck me, and laid hold of his arm with
one hand, and pulling him down by main force a little towards
him with the other, shot him into the head, and laid him dead
upon the spot. He then immediately stepped up to him who
had stopped us, as I said, and before he could come forward
again, for it was all done as it were in a moment, made a blow
at him with a scymitar, which he always wore, but missing the
man, cut his horse into the side of his head, cut one of his ears
off by the root, and a great slice down the side of his face.
The poor beast, enraged with the wound, was no more to be
governed by his rider, though the fellow sat well enough too;
but away he flew, and carried him quite out of the pilot's reach,
and at some distance, rising up upon his hind-legs, threw down
the Tartar, and fell upon him.
In this interval the poor Chinese came in who had lost the
camel, but he had no weapon. However, seeing the Tartar
down, and his horse fallen upon him, away he runs to him, and
seizing upon an ugly ill-favoured weapon he had by his side,
something like a pole-axe, but not a pole-axe neither, he
wrenched it from him, and made shift to knock his Tartarian
brains out with it. But my old man had the third Tartar to
deal with still ; and seeing he did not fly as he expected, nor
come on to fight him as he apprehended, but stand stock still,
the old man stood still too, and falls to work with his tackle to
charge his pistol again. But as soon as the Tartar saw the
pistol, whether he supposed it to be the same or another, I
know not; but away he scoured, and left my pilot, my
champion I called him afterward, a complete victory.
By this time I was a little awake; for I thought, when first
I began to wake, that I had been in a sweet sleep; but as I
said above, I wondered where I was, how I came upon the
ground, and what was the matter; in a word, a few moments
after, as sense returned, I felt pain, though I did not know
where. I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away
bloody; then I felt my head ache, and" then, in another
moment, memory returned, and everything was present to me
again.
I jumped up upon my feet instantly, and got hold of my
sword, but no enemies in view. I found a Tartar lie dead, and
his horse standing very quietly by him; and looking farther, I
saw my champion and deliverer, who had been to see what the
Chinese had done, coming back with his hanger in his hand.
The old man seeing me on my feet came running to me, and
embraced me with a great deal of joy, being afraid before that
I had been killed; and seeing me bloody, would see how I was
hurt; but it was not much, only what we call a broken head;
neither did I afterwards find any great inconvenience from the
blow other than the place which was hurt, and was well again
in two or three days.
We made no great gain, however, by this victory, for we
lost a camel, and gained a horse; but that which was remark-
able, when we came back to the village the man demanded to
be paid for the camel. I disputed it, and it was brought to a
hearing before the Chinese judge of the place; that is to say,
in English, we went before a justice of the peace. Give him
his due, he acted with a great deal of prudence and impartiality;
and having heard both sides, he gravely asked the Chinese man
that went with me to buy the camel whose servant he was?
"I am no servant," says he, "but went with the stranger."—
"At whose request?" says the justice.—"At the stranger's
request," says he.—"Why then," says the justice, "you were
the stranger's servant for the time, and the camel being delivered
to his servant, it was delivered to him, and he must pay for it."
I confess the thing was clear, that I had not a word to say;
but admiring to see such just reasoning upon the consequence,
and so accurate stating the case, I paid willingly for the camel,
and sent for another; but you may observe, I sent for it; I did
not go and fetch it myself any more; I had enough of that.
The city of Naun is a frontier of the Chinese Empire. They
call it fortified, and so it is, as fortifications go there; for this I
will venture to affirm, that all the Tartars in Karakathie, which,
I believe, are some millions, could not batter down the walls
with their bows and arrows; but to call it strong, if it were
attacked with cannon, would be to make those who understand it
laugh at you.
We wanted, as I have said, above two days' journey of this
city when messengers were sent express to every part of the
road to tell all travellers and caravans to halt till they had a
guard sent for them, for that an unusual body of Tartars,
making ten thousand in all, had appeared in the way, about
thirty miles beyond the city.
This was very bad news to travellers. However, it was
carefully done of the governor, and we were very glad to hear
we should have a guard. Accordingly, two days after, we had
two hundred soldiers sent us from a garrison of the Chinese on
our left, and three hundred more from the city of Naun, and
with those we advanced boldly; the three hundred soldiers
from Naun marched in our front, the two hundred in our rear,
and our men on each side of our camels with our baggage, and
the whole caravan in the centre. In this order, and well
prepared for battle, we thought ourselves a match for the whole
ten thousand Mongol Tartars if they had appeared; but the
next day, when they did appear, it was quite another thing.
It was early in the morning when, marching from a little
well-situated town called Changu, we had a river to pass, where
we were obliged to ferry; and had the Tartars had any
intelligence, then had been the time to have attacked us, when,
the caravan being over, the rearguard was behind; but they
did not appear.
About three hours after, when we were entered upon a
desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, behold, by a cloud
of dust they raised, we saw an enemy was at hand; and they
were at hand indeed, for they came on upon the spur.
The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had talked so big
the day before, began to stagger, and the soldiers frequently
looked behind them, which is a certain sign in a soldier that he
is just ready to run away. My old pilot was of my mind; and
being near me, he called out, "Seignior Inglese," says he,
"those fellows must be encouraged, or they will ruin us all;
for if the Tartars come on, they will never stand it."—" I am of
your mind," said I, "but what course must be done?"—
"Done!" says he, " let fifty of our men advance and flank them
on each wing, and encourage them, and they will fight like
brave fellows in brave company; but without, they will every
man turn his back." Immediately I rode up to our leader and
told him, who was exactly of our mind; and accordingly fifty
of us marched to the right wing, and fifty to the left, and the
rest made a line of reserve; and so we marched, leaving the
last two hundred men to make another body by themselves,
and to guard the camels; only that, if need were, they should
send a hundred men to assist the last fifty.
In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable
company they were; how many, we could not tell, but ten
thousand we thought was the least. A party of them came on
first and viewed our posture, traversing the ground in the front
of our line; and as we found them within gunshot, our leader
ordered the two wings to advance swiftly, and give them a
salvo on each wing with their shot, which was done; but they
went off, and I suppose back to give an account of the reception
they were like to meet with; and indeed that salute clogged
their stomach, for they immediately halted, stood a while to
consider of it, and wheeling off to the left they gave over the
design, and said no more to us for that time; which was very
agreeable to our circumstances, which were but very indifferent
for a battle with such a number.
Two days after this we came to the city of Naun, or Naum.
We thanked the governor for his care for us, and collected to
the value of a hundred crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to
the soldiers sent to guard us, and here we rested one day. This
is a garrison, indeed, and there were nine hundred soldiers kept
here; but the reason of it was, that formerly the Muscovite
frontiers lay nearer to them than they do now, the Muscovites
having abandoned that part of the country (which lies from this
city west for about two hundred miles) as desolate and unfit
for use; and more especially, being so very remote, and so
difficult to send troops thither for its defence; for we had yet
above two thousand miles to Muscovy, properly so called.
After this we passed several great rivers, and two dreadful
deserts, one of which we were sixteen days passing over, and
which, as I said, was to be called No Man's Land; and on the
13th of April we came to the frontiers of the Muscovite
dominions. I think the first city, or town, or fortress, whatever
it might be called, that belonged to the Czar of Muscovy, was
called Argunsk, being on the west side of the river Argun.
I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction that I was
soon arrived in, as I called it, a Christian country, or at least in
a country governed by Christians; for though the Muscovites
do, in my opinion, but just deserve the name of Christians, yet
such they pretend to be, and are very devout in their way.
I saluted the brave Scots merchant I mentioned above with
my first acknowledgment of this; and taking him by the hand,
I said to him, "Blessed be God, we are once again come among
Christians!" He smiled, and answered, "Do not rejoice too
soon, countryman; these Muscovites are but an odd sort of
Christians; and but for the name of it, you may see very little
of the substance for some months farther of our journey."
"Well," says I, "but still 'tis better than paganism, and
worshipping of devils."—"Why, I'll tell you," says he, "except
the Russian soldiers in garrisons, and a few of the inhabitants
of the cities upon the road, all the rest of this country, for
above a thousand miles farther, is inhabited by the worst and
most ignorant of pagans." And so indeed we found it.
We now advanced from the river Argun by easy and
moderate journeys, and were very visibly obliged to the care
the Czar of Muscovy has taken to have cities and towns built
in as many places as are possible to place them, where his
soldiers keep garrison something like the stationary soldiers
placed by the Romans in the remotest countries of their empire,
some of which I had read particularly were placed in Britain
for the security of commerce, and for the lodging travellers.
And thus it was here; for wherever we came, though at these
towns and stations the garrisons and governor were Russians
and professed Christians, yet the inhabitants of the country
were mere pagans, sacrificing to idols, and worshipping the sun,
moon, and stars, or all the host of heaven; and not only so, but
were, of all the heathens and pagans that ever I met with, the
most barbarous, except only that they did not eat man's flesh,
as our savages of America did.
Some instances of this we met with in the country between
Argunsk, where we enter the Muscovite dominions, and a city
of Tartars and Russians together, called Nertchinsk, in which
is a continued desert or forest, which cost us twenty days to
travel over it. In a village near the last of those places, I had
the curiosity to go and see their way of living, which is most
brutish and unsuflerable. They had, I suppose, a great
sacrifice that day; for there stood out upon an old stump of a
tree an idol made of wood, frightful as the devil, at least as
anything we can think of to represent the devil can be made.
It had a head certainly not so much as resembling any creature
that the world ever saw; ears as big as goat's horns, and as
high; eyes as big as a crown-piece; a nose like a crooked ram's
horn; and a mouth extended four-cornered, like that of a lion,
with horrible teeth, hooked like a parrot's under-bill. It was
dressed up in the filthiest manner that you could suppose; it's
upper garment was of sheep-skins, with the wool outward; a
great Tartar bonnet on the head, with two horns growing
through it; it was about eight feet high, yet had no feet or legs,
or any other proportion of parts.
This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village;
and when I came near to it there was sixteen or seventeen
creatures, whether men or women I could not tell, for they
make no distinction by their habits, either of body or head;
these lay all flat on the ground, round this formidable block of
shapeless wood. I saw no motion among them any more than
if they had been all logs of wood, like their idol; and at first
really thought they had been so; but when I came a little
nearer, they started up upon their feet, and raised a howling
cry, as if it had been so many deep-mouthed hounds, and
walked away as if they were displeased at our disturbing them.
A little way off from the idol, and at the door of that tent or
hut, made all of sheep-skins and cow-skins, dried, stood three
butchers; I thought they were such; when I came nearer to
them I found they had long knives in their hands, and in the
middle of the tent appeared three sheep killed, and one young
bullock, or steer. These, it seems, were sacrifices to that
senseless log of an idol, and these three men priests belonging
to it; and the seventeen prostrated wretches were the people
who brought the offering, and were making their prayers to
that stock.
I confess I was more moved at their stupidity and brutish
worship of a hobgoblin, than ever I was at anything in my life,
and I rode up to the image, or monster, call it what you will,
and with my sword cut the bonnet that was on its head in two
in the middle, so that it hung down by one of the horns ; and
one of our men that was with me took hold of the sheep-skin
that covered it, and pulled at it, when, behold, a most hideous
outcry and howling ran through the village, and two or three
hundred people came about my ears, so that I was glad to
scour for it, for we saw some had bows and arrows; but I
resolved from that moment to visit them again.
Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was
about four miles off, in order to provide some horses which
they wanted, several of the horses having been lamed and jaded
with the badness of the way and long march over the last
desert; so we had some leisure here to put my design in
execution. I communicated my project to the Scots merchant
of Moscow, of whose courage I had had sufficient testimony, as
above. I told him what I had seen, and with what indignation
I had since thought that human nature could be so degenerate.
I told him I was resolved, if I could but get four or five men
well armed to go with me, I was resolved to go and destroy
that vile, abominable idol, and let them see that it had no
power to help itself, and consequently could not be an object of
worship, or to be prayed to, much less help them that offered
sacrifices to it.
He laughed at me. Says he, " Your zeal may be good, but
what do you propose to yourself by it ?"—" Propose !" said I;
"to vindicate the honour of God, which is insulted by this devil
worship.'—" But how will it vindicate the honour of God," said
he, " while the people will not be able to know what you mean
by it, unless you could speak to them, and tell them so? and
then they will fight you, and beat you too, I'll assure you, for
they are desperate fellows, and that especially in defence of
their idolatry."—" Can we not," said I, "do it in the night, and
then leave them the reasons and causes in writing, in their own
language ?"—" Writing !" said he; "why, there is not a man in
five nations of them that know anything of a letter, or how to
read a word in any language, or in their own."—"Wretched
ignorance!" said I to him ; "however, I have a great mind to do
it; perhaps Nature may draw inferences from it to them, to let
them see how brutish they are to worship such horrid things."
—" Look you, sir," said he, "if your zeal prompts you to it so
warmly, you must do it; but in the next place I would have
you consider these wild nations of people are subjected by force
to the Czar of Muscovy's dominions; and if you do this 'tis ten
to one but they will come by thousands to the governor of
Nertchinsk, and complain, and demand satisfaction ; and if he
cannot give them satisfaction, 'tis ten to one but they revolt,
and will occasion a new war with all the Tartars in the
country."
This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head for a while;
but I harped upon the same string still, and all that day I was
uneasy to put my project in execution. Towards the evening
the Scots merchant met me by accident in our walk about the
town, and desired to speak with me. "I believe," said he, " I
have put you off of your good design; I have been a little con-
cerned about it since, for I abhor the idol and idolatry as much
as you can do."—"Truly," says I, "you have put it off a little
as to the execution of it, but you have not put it all out of my
thoughts, and I believe I shall do it still before I quit this
place, though I were to be delivered up to them for satisfaction."—
"No, no," says he; "God forbid they should deliver you up to
such a crew of monsters! they shall not do that neither; that
would be murdering you indeed."—"Why," says I, "how would
they use me ?"—" Use you !" says he; " I'll tell you how they
served a poor Russian who affronted them in their worship just
as you did, and who they took prisoner after they had lamed
him with an arrow, that he could not run away. They took
him and stripped him stark naked, and set him up on the top
of the idol monster, and stood all round him, and shot as many
arrows into him as would stick over his whole body; and then
they burnt him, and all the arrows sticking in him, as a
sacrifice to the idol."—"And was this the same idol?"—"Yes,"
says he," the very same."—" Well," says I," I'll tell you a story."
So I related the story of our men at Madagascar, and how they
burnt and sacked the village there, and killed man, woman, and
child for their murdering one of our men, just as it is related
before; and when I had done, I added that I thought we ought
to do so to this village.
He listened very attentively to the story; but when I
talked of doing so to that village, says he, " You mistake very
much; it was not this village, it was almost a hundred miles
from this place; but it was the same idol, for they carry him
about in procession all over the country."—"Well then," says I,
"then that idol ought to be punished for it; and it shall," says
I, " if I live this night out."
In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the design, and told
me I should not go alone, but he would go with me, and bring
a stout fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also with us; "and
one," says he, " as famous for his zeal as you can desire any one
to be against such devilish things as these." In a word, he
brought me his comrade, a Scotsman, whom he called Captain
Richardson; and I gave him a full account of what I had seen,
and, in a word, of what I intended; and he told me readily he
would go with me if it cost him his life; so we agreed to go,
only us three. I had, indeed, proposed it to my partner, but
he declined it. He said he was ready to assist me to the
utmost, and upon all occasions, for my defence; but that this
was an adventure quite out of his way; so, I say, we resolved
upon our work, only us three, and my man-servant, and to put
it in execution that night about midnight, with all the secrecy
imaginable.
However, upon second thoughts we were willing to delay it
till the next night, because the caravan being to set forward in
the morning, we supposed the governor could not pretend to
give them any satisfaction upon us when we were out of his
power. The Scots merchant, as steady in his resolution for the
enterprise as bold in executing, brought me a Tartar's robe
or gown of the sheep-skins, and a bonnet, with a bow and
arrows, and had provided the same for himself and his country-
man, that the people, if they saw us, should not be able to
determine who we were.
All the first night we spent in mixing up some combustible
matter with aqua-vitae, gunpowder, and such other materials as
we could get; and having a good quantity of tar in a little pot,
about an hour after night we set out upon our expedition.
We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and
found that the people had not the least jealousy of danger
attending their idol; the night was cloudy, yet the moon gave
us light enough to see that the idol stood just in the same
posture and place that it did before. The people seemed to be
all at their rest; only, that in the great hut, or tent, as we
called it, where we saw the three priests, whom we mistook for
butchers, we saw a light, and going up close to the door we
heard people talking, as if there were five or six of them. We
concluded, therefore, that if we set the wild-fire to the idol,
these men would come out immediately and run up to the
place to rescue it from the destruction that we intended
for it; and what to do with them we knew not. Once we
thought of carrying it away, and setting fire to it at a distance;
but when we came to handle it, we found it too bulky for our
carriage, so we were at a loss again. The second Scotsman
was for setting fire to the tent or hut, and knocking the creatures
that were there on the head when they came out; but I could
not join with that. I was against killing them, if it was
possible to be avoided. "Well then," said the Scots merchant,
"I'll tell you what we will do; we will try to take them prisoners,
tie their hands behind them, and make them stand still and see
their idol destroyed."
As it happened, we had twine or packthread enough about
us, which was used to tie our fireworks together with; so we
resolved to attack the people first, and with as little noise as we
could. The first thing we did we knocked at the door, which
2F
issued just as we desired it; for one of their idol priests came
to the door. We immediately seized upon him, stopped his
mouth, and tied his hands behind him, and led him to the idol,
where we gagged him that he might not make a noise, tied his
feet also together, and left him on the ground.
Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that another
would come out to see what the matter was; but we waited so
long till the third man came back to us, and then nobody
coming out, we knocked again gently, and immediately out came
two more, and we served them just in the same manner, but
were obliged to go all with them, and lay them down by the
idol some distance from one another; when going back we
found two more were come out to the door, and a third stood
between them within the door. We seized the two, and
immediately tied them, when the third stepping back, and
crying out, my Scots merchant went in after him, and taking
out a composition we had made, that would only smoke and
stink, he set fire to it, and threw it in among them. By that
time the other Scotsman and my man taking charge of the two
men who were already bound, and tied together also by the arm,
led them away to the idol, and left them there, to see if their
idol would relieve them, making haste back to us.
When the fuze we had thrown in had filled the hut with so
much smoke that they were almost suffocated, we then threw in a
small leather bag of another kind, which flamed like a candle,
and following it in we found there was but four people left, who,
it seems, were two men and two women, and, as we supposed,
had been about some of their diabolic sacrifices. They
appeared, in short, frighted to death, at least so as to sit
trembling and stupid, and not able to speak neither for the
smoke.
In a word, we took them, bound them as we had the others,
and all without any noise. I should have said we brought them
out of the house, or hut, first; for, indeed, we were not able to
bear the smoke any more than they were. When we had done
this, we carried them all together to the idol. When we came
there, we fell to work with him; and first we daubed him all
over, and his robes also, with tar and such other stuff as we had,
which was tallow mixed with brimstone; then we stopped his
eyes, ears, and mouth full of gunpowder; and then we wrapped
up a great piece of wild-fire in his bonnet; and then sticking all
the combustibles we had brought with us upon him, we looked
about to see if we could find anything else to help to burn him;
when my man remembered that by the tent or hut, where the
men were, there lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw or
rushes I do not remember; away he and one of the Scotsmen
ran, and fetched their arms full of that. When we had done
this, we took all our prisoners, and brought them, having untied
their feet and ungagged their mouths, and made them stand up,
and set them just before their monstrous idol, and there set fire
to the whole.
We stayed by it a quarter of an hour or thereabouts, till the
powder in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of the idol blew up,
and we could perceive had split and deformed the shape, and in
a word, till we saw it burn into a mere block or log of wood;
and then setting the dry forage to it, we found it would be
quite consumed, when we began to think of going away; but
the Scotsman said, " No, we must not go, for these poor deluded
wretches will all throw themselves into the fire, and burn them-
selves with the idol." So we resolved to stay till the forage was
burnt down too, and then we came away and left them.
In the morning we appeared among our fellow-travellers,
exceeding busy in getting ready for our journey; nor could any
man suggest that we had been anywhere but in our beds, as
travellers might be supposed to be, to fit themselves for the
fatigue of that day's journey.
But it did not end so. The next day came a great multitude
of the country people, not only of this village, but of a hundred
more, for aught I know, to the town gates, and in a most
outrageous manner demanded satisfaction of the Russian
governor for the insulting their priests, and burning their great
Cham-Chi-Thaungu, such a hard name they gave the monstrous
creature they worshipped. The people of Nertchinsk were
at first in a great consternation; for they said the Tartars were
no less than thirty thousand, and that in a few days more would
be one hundred thousand strong.
The Russian governor sent out messengers to appease them,
and gave them all the good words imaginable. He assured
them he knew nothing of it, and that there had not a soul of
his garrison been abroad; that it could not be from anybody
there; and if they would let him know who it was, they should
be exemplarily punished. They returned haughtily that all the
country reverenced the great Cham-Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in
the sun, and no mortal would have dared to offer violence to
his image but some Christian miscreant, so they called them, it
seems ; and they therefore denounced war against him and all the
Russians, who, they said, were miscreants and Christians.
The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make a breach,
or to have any cause of war alleged to be given by him, the
Czar having strictly charged them to treat the conquered
country with gentleness and civility, gave them still all the
good words he could. At last he told them there was a caravan
gone towards Russia that morning, and perhaps it was some of
them who had done them this injury; and that if they would be
satisfied with that, he would send after them, to inquire into it.
This seemed to appease them a little; and accordingly the
governor sent after us, and gave us a particular account how the
thing was, intimating withal that if any in our caravan had done
it they should make their escape; but that whether they
had done it or no, we should make all the haste forward that
was possible, and that in the meantime he would keep them in
play as long as he could.
This was very friendly in the governor. However, when it
came to the caravan there was nobody knew anything of the
matter; and as for us that were guilty, we were the least
of all suspected; none so much as asked us the question. How-
ever, the captain of the caravan for the time took the hint that
the governor gave us, and we marched or travelled two days
and two nights without any considerable stop, and then we lay
at a village called Plotbus. It was the second day's march from
Plotbus that by the clouds of dust behind us, at a great distance
some of our people began to be sensible we were pursued. We
had entered the desert, and had passed by a great lake called
Schaks-Oser, when we perceived a very great body of horse
appear on the other side of the lake to the north, we travelling
west. We observed they went away west, as we did, but had
supposed we would have taken that side of the lake, whereas

SENT THREE MESSENGERS TO us.
we very happily took the south side; and in two days more we
saw them not.
The third day they either found their mistake, or had in-
telligence of us, and came pouring in upon us towards the dusk
of the evening. We had, to our great satisfaction, just pitched
upon a place for our camp which was very convenient for the
night; for as we were upon a desert, though but at the beginning
of it, that was above five hundred miles over, we had no towns to
lodge at.
Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued for; but
as it was usual for the Mongol Tartars to go about in troops in
that desert, so the caravans always fortify themselves every
night against them as against armies of robbers; and it was,
therefore, no new thing to be pursued.
In this posture we encamped for the night; but the enemy
was upon us before we had finished our situation. They did
not come on us like thieves, as we expected, but sent three
messengers to us, to demand the men to be delivered to them
that had abused their priests, and burnt their god Cham-Chi-
Thaungu with fire, that they might burn them with fire; and
upon this, they said they would go away, and do us no farther
harm; otherwise, they would burn us all with fire. Our men
looked very blank at this message, and began to stare at one
another to see who looked with most guilt in their faces; but
"nobody" was the word, nobody did it. The leader of the
caravan sent word he was well assured it was not done by any of
our camp; that we were peaceable merchants travelling on our
business; that we had done no harm to them, or to any one
else; and that, therefore, they must look farther for their
enemies who had injured them, for we were not the people; so
desired them not to disturb us, for if they did, we should defend
ourselves.
They were far from being satisfied with this for an answer,
but a great crowd of them came down in the morning, by break
of day, to our camp; but seeing us in an unaccountable situa-
tion, they durst come no farther than the brook in our front,
where they stood and showed us such a number, that indeed
terrified us very much; for those that spoke least of them, spoke
of ten thousand. Here they stood and looked at us a while,
and then setting up a great howl, they let fly a crowd of arrows
among us; but we were well enough fortified for that, for we
sheltered under our baggage; and I do not remember that one
man of us was hurt.
Some time after this we saw them move a little to our right,
and expected them on the rear, when a cunning fellow, a
Cossack, as they call them, of Jerawena, in the pay of the
Muscovites, calling to the leader of the caravan, said to him,
"I'll go send all these people away to Shilka " ; this was a city
four or five days' journey at least to the south, and rather behind
us. So he takes his bow and arrows, and getting on horseback,
he rides away from our rear directly, as it were back to
Nertchinsk; after this he takes a great circuit about, and comes
to the army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent express to
tell them a long story, that the people who had burnt the Cham-
Chi-Thaungu were gone to Shilka with a caravan of miscreants,
as he called them, that is to say, Christians, and that they had
resolved to burn the god Schal-Isar, belonging to the Tonguses.
As this fellow was himself a mere Tartar, and perfectly
spoke their language, he counterfeited so well, that they all took
it from him, and away they drove in a most violent hurry to
Shilka, which it seems was five days' journey to the north; and
in less than three hours they were entirely out of our sight, and
we never heard any more of them, and we never knew whether
they went to that other place called Shilka or no. So we
passed safely on to the city of Jerawena, where there was a
garrison of Muscovites; and there we rested five days, the
caravan being exceedingly fatigued with the last day's hard
march, and with want of rest in the night.
From this city we had a frightful desert, which held us three
and twenty days' march. We furnished ourselves with some
tents here, for the better accommodating ourselves in the night;
and the leader of the caravan procured sixteen carriages, or
waggons, of the country for carrying our water and provisions;
and these carriages were our defence every night round our
little camp; so that had the Tartars appeared, unless they had
been very numerous indeed, they would not have been able to
hurt us.
We may well be supposed to want rest again after this long
journey; for in this desert we saw abundance of the sable-
hunters, as they called them. These are all Tartars of the
Mongol Tartary, of which this country is a part, and they
frequently attack small caravans; but we saw no numbers of
them together. I was curious to see the sable skins they
catched, but could never speak with any of them, for they durst
not come near us, neither durst we straggle from our company
to go near them.
After we had passed this desert, we came into a country
pretty well inhabited; that is to say, we found towns and
castles settled by the Czar of Muscovy with garrisons of
stationary soldiers, to protect the caravans, and defend the
country against the Tartars, who would otherwise make it very
dangerous travelling; and his czarish majesty has given such
strict orders for the well guarding the caravans and merchants,
that if there are any Tartars heard of in the country, detach-
ments of the garrisons are always sent to see the travellers safe
from station to station. And thus the governor of Udinsk,
whom I had opportunity to make a visit to by means of the
Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him, offered us a
guard of fifty men to the next station.
I thought long before this, that as we came nearer to Europe
we should find the country better peopled, and the people more
civilised; but I found myself mistaken in both, for we had yet
the nation of the Tonguses to pass through, where we saw the
same tokens of paganism and barbarity, or worse, than before;
only as they were conquered by the Muscovites, and entirely
reduced, they were not so dangerous; but for rudeness of
manners, idolatry, and multitheism, no people in the world ever
went beyond them. They are clothed all in skins of beasts, and
their houses are built of the same. You know not a man from a
woman, neither by the ruggedness of their countenances or their
clothes; and in the winter, when the ground is covered with
snow, they live underground, in houses like vaults, which have
cavities going from one to another.
. If the Tartars had their Cham-Chi-Thaungu for a whole
village or country, these had idols in every hut and in every
cave; besides, they worship the stars, the sun, the water, the
snow; and in a word, everything that they do not understand—
and they understand but very little—so that almost every
element, every uncommon thing, sets them a-sacrificing.
But I am no more to describe people than countries, any
farther than my own story comes to be concerned in them. I
met with nothing peculiar to myself in this country, which I
reckon was, from the desert which I spoke of last, at least four
hundred miles, half of it being another desert, which took us up
twelve days' severe travelling, without house, or tree, or bush,
but were obliged again to carry our own provisions, as well
water as bread. After we were out of this desert, and had
travelled two days, we came to Yeniseisk, a Muscovite city or
station on the great river Yenisei. This river, they told us,
parted Europe from Asia, though our map-makers, as I am told,
do not agree to it; however, it is certainly the eastern boundary
of the ancient Siberia, which now makes up a province only of
the vast Muscovite Empire, but is itself equal in bigness to the
whole empire of Germany.
And yet here I observed ignorance and paganism still pre-
vailed, except in the Muscovite garrisons. All the country
between the river Obi and the river Yenisei is as entirely pagan,
and the people as barbarous, as the remotest of the Tartars;
nay, as any nation, for aught I know, in Asia or America. I
also found, which I observed to the Muscovite governors, whom
I had opportunity to converse with, that the poor pagans are
not much the wiser, or the nearer Christianity, for being under
the Muscovite government, which they acknowledged was true
enough, but as they said, was none of their business; that if the
Czar expected to convert his Siberian, or Tonguse, or Tartar
subjects, it should be done by sending clergymen among them,
not soldiers; and they added, with more sincerity than I ex-
pected, that they found it was not so much the concern of their
monarch to make the people Christians, as it was to make them
subjects.
From this river to the great river Obi we crossed a wild and
uncultivated country; I cannot say 'tis a barren soil; 'tis only
barren of people, and good management, otherwise it is in itself
a most pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country. What inhabi-
tants we found in it are all pagans, except such as are sent
among them from Russia; for this is the country, I mean on
both sides the river Obi, whither the Muscovite criminals, that
are not put to death, are banished, and from whence it is next
to impossible they should ever come away.
I have nothing material to say of my particular affairs till 1
came to Tobolsk, the capital city of Siberia, where I continued
some time on the following occasion.
We had been now almost seven months on our journey, and
winter began to come on apace, whereupon my partner and I
called a council about our particular affairs, in which we found
it proper, considering that we were bound for England, and not
for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of ourselves. They told
us of sledges and reindeer to carry us over the snow in the
winter-time; and, indeed, they have such things, that it would
be incredible to relate the particulars of, by which means the
Russians travel more in the winter than they can in summer,
because in these sledges they are able to run all night and day;
the snow being frozen, is one universal covering to Nature, by
which the hills, the vales, the rivers, the lakes all are smooth,
and hard as a stone.
But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey of this
kind. I was bound to England, not to Moscow, and my route
lay two ways; either I must go on, as the caravan went, till I
came to Jaroslav, and then go off west for Narva and the Gulf
of Finland, and so either by sea or land to Dantzic, where I
might possibly sell my China cargo to good advantage, or I
must leave the caravan at a little town on the Dwina, from
whence 1 had but six days by water to Archangel, and from
thence might be sure of shipping either to England, Holland,
or Hamburg.
Now to go any of these journeys in the winter would have
been preposterous; for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would be
frozen up, and I could not get passage; and to go by land in
those countries, was far less safe than among the Mongol
Tartars; likewise to go to Archangel in October, all the ships
would be gone from thence, and even the merchants, who dwell
there in summer, retire south to Moscow in the winter when
the ships are gone, so that I should have nothing but extremity
of cold to encounter, with a scarcity of provisions, and must
lie there in an empty town all the winter; so that, upon the
whole, I thought it a much better way to let the caravan go,
and to make provision to winter where I was, viz., at Tobolsk,
in Siberia, in the latitude of [fifty-eight] degrees, where I was
sure of three things to wear out a cold winter with, viz., plenty
of provision, such as the country afforded, a warm house, with
fuel enough, and excellent company; of all which I shall give
a full account in its place.
I was now in a quite different climate from my beloved
island, where I never felt cold, except when I had my ague; on
the contrary, I had much to do to bear my clothes on my back,
and never made any fire but without doors, and for my
necessity, in dressing my food, &c. Now I made me three
good vests, with large robes or gowns over them, to hang down
to the feet, and button close to the wrists, and all these lined
with furs to make them sufficiently warm.
As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly disliked our
way in England of making fires in every room in the house, in
open chimneys, which, when the fire was out, always kept the
air in the room cold as the climate; but taking an apartment in
a good house in the town, I ordered a chimney to be built like
a furnace, in the centre of six several rooms, like a stove; the
funnel to carry the smoke went up one way, the door to come
at the fire went in another, and all the rooms were kept equally
warm, but no fire seen, just as they heat the bagnios in England.
By this means we had always the same climate in all the
rooms, and an equal heat was preserved; and how cold soever
it was without, it was always warm within; and yet we saw no
fire, nor was incommoded with any smoke.
The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be
possible to meet with good company here, in a country so bar-
barous as that of the most northerly parts of Europe, near the
Frozen ocean, and within but a few degrees of Nova Zembla.
But this being the country where the state criminals of
Muscovy, as I observed before, are all banished, this city was full
of noblemen, princes, gentlemen, colonels, and, in short, all
degrees of the nobility, gentry, soldiery, and courtiers of
Muscovy. Here was the famous Prince Galliozen, the old
General Robostiski, and several other persons of note, and some
ladies.
By means of my Scots merchant, whom, nevertheless, I
parted with here, I made an acquaintance here with several of
these gentlemen, and some of them of the first rank; and from
these in the long winter nights in which I stayed here I received
several very agreeable visits. It was talking one night with
Prince one of the banished ministers of state belonging
to the Czar of Muscovy, that my talk of my particular case
began. He had been telling me abundance of fine things of
the greatness, the magnificence, the dominions, and the
absolute power of the Emperor of the Russians. I interrupted
him, and told him I was a greater and more powerful
prince than ever the Czar of Muscovy was, though my
dominions were not so large or my people so many. The
Russian grandee looked a little surprised, and fixing his eyes
steadily upon me, began to wonder what I meant.
I told him his wonder would cease when I had explained
myself. First, I told him I had the absolute disposal of the
lives and fortunes of all my subjects; that notwithstanding my
absolute power, I had not one person disaffected to my govern-
ment or to my person in all my dominions. He shook his head
at that, and said, there indeed I outdid the Czar of Muscovy. I
told him that all the lands in my kingdom were my own, and
all my subjects were not only my tenants, but tenants at will;
that they would all fight for me to the last drop; and that
never tyrant, for such I acknowledged myself to be, was ever so
universally beloved, and yet so horribly feared, by his subjects.
After amusing them with these riddles in government for a
while, I opened the case, and told them the story at large of my
living in the island, and how I managed both myself and the
people there that were under me, just as I have since minuted it
down. They were exceedingly taken with the story, and
especially the prince, who told me with a sigh that the true
greatness of life was to be master of ourselves; that he would
not have exchanged such a state of life as mine to have been
Czar of Muscovy; and that he found more felicity in the
retirement he seemed to be banished to there, than ever he
found in the highest authority he enjoyed in the court of his
master the Czar; that the height of human wisdom was to
bring our tempers down to our circumstances, and to make a
calm within, under the weight of the greatest storm without.
"Nor, sir," says he,"do I bring my mind to this politically
by the necessity of my circumstances, which some call miser-
able; but if I know anything of myself, I would not now go
back, though the Czar, my master, should call me, and reinstate
me in all my former grandeur; I say, I would no more go back
to it, than I believe my soul, when it shall be delivered from
this prison of the body, and has had a taste of the glorious state
beyond life, would come back to the gaol of flesh and blood it
is now inclosed in, and leave heaven to deal in the dirt and crime
of human affairs."
He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, so much
earnestness and motion of his spirits, which were apparent in
his countenance, that it was evident it was the true sense of his
soul; there was no room to doubt his sincerity.
I have not room to give a full account of the most agreeable
conversation I had with this truly great man, in all which he
showed that his mind was so inspired with a superior knowledge
of things, so supported by religion as well as by a vast share of
wisdom, that his contempt of the world was really as much as
he had expressed, and that he was always the same to the last,
as will appear in the story I am going to tell.
I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful winter I
thought it to be, the cold so intense, that I could not so much
as look about without being wrapped in furs, and a mask of fur
before my face, or rather a hood, with only a hole for breath,
and two for sight. The little daylight we had was, as we
reckoned, for three months, not above five hours a day, and six
at most; only that the snow lying on the ground continually,
and the weather clear, it was never quite dark. Our horses
were kept, or rather starved, underground; and as for our
servants, for we hired three servants here to look after our
horses and selves, we had every now and then their fingers and
toes to thaw, lest they should mortify and fall off.
It is true within doors we were warm, the houses being
close, the walls thick, the lights small, and the glass all double.
Our food was chiefly the flesh of deer, dried and cured in the
season; good bread enough, but baked as biscuits; dried fish
of several sorts, and some flesh of mutton, and of the buffaloes,
which is pretty good beef. All the stores of provision for the
winter are laid up in the summer, and well cured. Our drink
was water mixed with aqua-vitae instead of brandy; and for a
treat, mead instead of wine, which, however, they have excel-
lent good. The hunters, who venture abroad all weathers,
frequently brought us in fresh venison, very fat and good; and
sometimes bear's flesh, but we did not much care for the last.
We had a good stock of tea, with which we treated our friends,
as above; and, in a word, we lived very cheerfully and well all
things considered.
It was now March and the days grown considerably longer,
and the weather at least tolerable, so the other travellers began
to prepare sleds to carry them over the snow, and to get things
ready to be going; but my measures being fixed, as I have said,
for Archangel, and not to Muscovy or the Baltic, I made no
motion, knowing very well that the ships from the south do not
set out for that part of the world till May or June, and that if
I was there by the beginning of August, it would be as soon as
any ships would be ready to go away, and therefore, I say, I
made no haste to be gone, as others did; in a word, I saw a
great many people—nay, all the travellers—go away before me.
In short, about the latter end of May I began to make all
ready to pack up; and as I was doing this, it occurred to me
that seeing all these people were banished by the Czar of
Muscovy to Siberia, and yet when they came there were left at
liberty to go whither they would, why did they not then go
away to any part of the world wherever they thought fit? and
I began to examine what should hinder them from making such
an attempt.
But my wonder was over when I entered upon that subject
with the person I have mentioned, who answered me thus:
"Consider first, sir," said he, "the place where we are, and
secondly, the condition we are in; especially," said he, "the
generality of the people who are banished hither. We are
surrounded," said he," with stronger things than bars and bolts;
on the north side an unnavigable ocean, where ship never sailed,
and boat never swam; neither, if we had both, could we know
where to go with them. Every other way," said he, "we have
above a thousand miles to pass through the Czar's own
dominions, and by ways utterly unpassable except by the roads
made by the governor, and by the towns garrisoned by his
troops, so that we could neither pass undiscovered by the road,
or subsist any other way, so that it is in vain to attempt it."
I was silenced indeed at once, and found that they were in a
prison every jot as secure as if they had been locked up in the
castle at Moscow. However, it came into my thought that I
might certainly be made an instrument to procure the escape
of this excellent person, and that whatever hazard I ran, I
would certainly try if I could carry him off. Upon this I took
an occasion one evening to tell him my thoughts. I represented
to him that it was very easy for me to carry him away, there
being no guard over him in the country; and as I was not
going to Moscow, but to Archangel, and that I went in the
nature of a caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in the
stationary towns in the desert, but could encamp every night
where I would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to Arch-
angel, where I would immediately secure him on board an
English or Dutch ship and carry him off safe along with me.
He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on me
all the while 1 spoke; nay, I could see in his very face that
what I said put his spirits into an exceeding ferment; his
colour frequently changed, his eyes looked red, and his heart
fluttered, that it might be even perceived in his countenance,
nor could he immediately answer me when I had done, and, as
it were, expected what he would say to it; but after he had
paused a little, he embraced me, and said, " How happy are we,
unguarded creatures as we are, that even our greatest acts of
friendship are made snares to us, and we are made tempters of
one another! My dear friend," said he, "your offer is so
sincere, has such kindness in it, is so disinterested in itself, and
is so calculated for my advantage, that I must have very little
knowledge of the world if I did not both wonder at it and ac-
knowledge the obligation I have upon me to you for it. But did
you believe I was sincere in what I have so often said to you
of my contempt of the world? Did you believe I spoke my
very soul to you, and that I had really obtained that degree of
felicity here, that had placed me above all that the world could
give me, or do for me? Did you believe I was sincere when I
told you I would not go back, if I was recalled even to all that
once I was in the court, with the favour of the Czar my master?
Did you believe me, my friend, to be an honest man? or did
you think me to be a boasting hypocrite?" Here he stopped
as if he would hear what I would say; but indeed I soon after
perceived that he stopped because his spirits were in motion;
his great heart was full of struggles, and he could not go on. I
was, I confess, astonished at the thing as well as at the man,
and I used some arguments with him to urge him to set himself
free; that he ought to look upon this as a door opened by
Heaven for his deliverance, and a summons by Providence, who
has the care and disposition of all events, to do himself good,
and to render himself useful in the world.
He had by this time recovered himself. "How do you
know, sir," says he warmly, "that instead of a summons from
Heaven it may not be a feint of another instrument, represent-
ing in all the alluring colours to me the show of felicity as a
deliverance, which may in itself be my snare, and tend directly
to my ruin? Here I am, free from the temptation of returning
to my former miserable greatness; there I am not sure but that
all the seeds of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury, which I
know remain in nature, may revive and take root, and in a word,
again overwhelm me; and then the happy prisoner, whom you
see now master of his soul's liberty, shall be the miserable slave
of his own senses, in the full of all personal liberty. Dear sir,
let me remain in this blessed confinement, banished from the
crimes of life, rather than purchase a show of freedom at the
expense of the liberty of my reason, and at the expense of the
future happiness which now I have in my view, but shall then,
I fear, quickly lose sight of; for I am but flesh, a man, a mere
man, have passions and affections as likely to possess and over-
throw me as any man. Oh, be not my friend and my tempter
both together!"
If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and stood
silent, looking at him, and indeed admired at what I saw. The
struggle in his soul was so great, that though the weather was
extremely cold it put him into a most violent sweat, and I
found he wanted to give vent to his mind; so I said a word or
two, that I would leave him to consider of it, and wait on him
again, and then I withdrew to my own apartment.
About two hours after, I heard somebody at or near the
door of my room, and I was going to open the door; but he
had opened it, and came in. "My dear friend," says he, "you
had almost overset me, but I am recovered; do not take it 511
that I do not close with your offer; I assure you 'tis not for
want of a sense of the kindness of it in you, and I came to
make the most sincere acknowledgment of it to you; but I
hope I have got the victory over myself."
"My lord," said I, "I hope you are fully satisfied that you
do not resist the call of Heaven."—" Sir," said he, " if it had
been from Heaven, the same Power would have influenced me
to accept it; but I hope, and am fully satisfied, that it is from
Heaven that I decline it; and I have an infinite satisfaction in
the parting, that you shall leave me an honest man still, though
not a free man."
I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make professions
to him of my having no end in it but a sincere desire to serve
him. He embraced me very passionately, and assured me he
was sensible of that, and should always acknowledge it; and
with that he offered me a very fine present of sables, too much
indeed for me to accept from a man in his circumstances; and
I would have avoided them, but he would not be refused.
The next morning I sent my servant to his lordship with a
small present of tea and two pieces of China damask and four
little wedges of Japan gold, which did not all weigh above six
ounces or thereabout, but were far short of the value of his
sables, which indeed when I came to England I found worth
near £200. He accepted the tea and one piece of the damask
and one of the pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp upon it
of the Japan coinage, which I found he took for the rarity of
it, but would not take any more, and he sent word by my
servant that he desired to speak with me.
When I came to him, he told me I knew what had passed
between us, and hoped I would not move him any more in that
affair ; but that since I had made such a generous offer to him,
he asked me if I had kindness enough to offer the same to
another person that he would name to me, in whom he had a
great share of concern. I told him that I could not say I
inclined to do so much for any one but himself, for whom I had
a particular value, and should have been glad to have been the
instrument of his deliverance. However, if he would please to
name the person to me, I would give him my answer, and hoped
he would not be displeased with me if he was with my answer.
He told me it was only his son, whom, though I had not seen,
yet was in the same condition with himself, and above two
hundred miles from him, on the other side the Obi; but that if
I consented, he would send for him.
I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. I made
some ceremony in letting him understand that it was wholly on
his account and that seeing I could not prevail on him, I would
show my respect to him by my concern for his son; but these
things are too tedious to repeat here. He sent away the next
day for his son, and in about twenty days he came back with
the messenger, bringing six or seven horses loaded with very
rich furs, and which, in the whole, amounted to a very great
value. His servants brought the horses into the town, but left
the young lord at a distance till night, when he came incognito
into our apartment, and his father presented him to me, and in
2G
short, we concerted there the manner of our travelling, and
everything proper for the journey.
I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black fox-
skins, fine ermines, and such other furs as are very rich; I say,
I had bought them in that city in exchange for some of the
goods I brought from China; in particular for the cloves and
nutmegs, of which I sold the greatest part here, and the rest
afterwards at Archangel, for a much better price than I could
have done at London; and my partner, who was sensible of the
profit, and whose business was merchandise, was mightily pleased
with our stay on account of the traffic we made here.
It was the beginning of June when I left this remote place,
a city, I believe, little heard of in the world; and indeed it is so
far out of the road of commerce, that I know not how it should
be much talked of. We were now come to a very small
caravan, being only thirty-two horses and camels in all, and
all of them passed for mine, though my new guest was pro-
prietor of eleven of them. It was most natural also that I
should take more servants with me than I had before, and the
young lord passed for my steward; what great man I passed
for myself I know not, neither did it concern me to inquire.
We had here the worst and the largest desert to pass over that
we met with in all the journey; the best we had to say for it
was, that we thought we had no troops of Tartars and robbers
to fear, and that they never came on this side the Obi, or at
least but very seldom; but we found it otherwise.
My young lord had with him a faithful Muscovite servant,
or rather a Siberian servant, who was perfectly acquainted with
the country, and led us by private roads that we avoided coming
into the principal towns and cities upon the great road, such as
Tuimen, Solikamsk, and several others, because the Muscovite
garrisons which are kept there are very curious and strict in
their observation upon travellers, and searching lest any of the
banished persons of note should make their escape that way
into Muscovy; but by this means, as we were kept out of the
cities, so our whole journey was a desert, and we were obliged
to encamp and lie in our tents, when we might have had very
good accommodation in the cities on the way. This the young
lord was so sensible of, that he would not allow us to lie abroad
when we came to several cities on the way, but lay abroad
himself with his servant in the woods, and met us always at the
appointed places.
We were just entered Europe, having passed the river Kama,
which in these parts is the boundary between Europe and Asia;
and the first city on the European side was called Solikamsk,
which is as much as to say, the great city on the river Kama;
and here we thought to have seen some evident alteration in
the people, their manner, their habit, their religion, and their
business; but we were mistaken; for as we had a vast desert to
pass, which by relation is near seven hundred miles long in some
places, but not above two hundred miles over where we passed
it, so till we came past that horrible place we found very little
difference between that country and the Mongol Tartary; the
people mostly pagans, and little better than the savages of
America; their houses and towns full of idols, and their way of
living wholly barbarous, except in the cities as above, and the
villages near them; where there are Christians, as they call
themselves, of the Greek Church, but have their religion mingled
with so many relics of superstition, that it is scarce to be known
in some places from mere sorcery and witchcraft.
In passing this forest, I thought indeed we must, after all
our dangers were, in our imagination, escaped, as before, have
been plundered and robbed, and perhaps murdered, by a troop
of thieves; of what country they were, whether the roving bands
of the Ostiaks, a kind of Tartars, or wild people on the bank of
the Obi, and ranged thus far, or whether they were the sable-
hunters of Siberia, I am yet at a loss to know; but they were all on
horseback, carried bows and arrows, and were at first about
five and forty in number. They came so near to us as within
about two musket-shot; and asking no questions, they sur-
rounded us with their horse, and looked very earnestly upon us
twice. At length they placed themselves just in our way, upon
which we drew up in a little line before our camels, being not
above sixteen men in all; and being drawn up thus we halted,
and sent out the Siberian servant who attended his lord to see
who they were. His master was the more willing to let him
go, because he was not a little apprehensive that they were a
Siberian troop sent out after him. The man came up near them
with a flag of truce, and called them; but though he spoke
several of their languages, or dialects of languages rather, he
could not understand a word they said. However, after some
signs to him not to come nearer to them at his peril, so he said
he understood them to mean, offering to shoot at him if he ad-
vanced, the fellow came back no wiser than he went, only that
by their dress, he said he believed them to be some Tartars of
Kalmuck, or of Circassian hordes ; and that there must be more
of them upon the great desert, though he never heard that any
of them ever were seen so far north before.
This was small comfort to us; however, we had no remedy.
There was on our left hand, at about a quarter of a mile's
distance, a little grove or clump of trees, which stood close to-
gether, and very near the road. I immediately resolved we would
advance to those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we could
there; for first, I considered that the trees would in a great
measure cover us from their arrows; and in the next place,
they could not come to charge us in a body. It was indeed
my old Portuguese pilot who proposed it, and who had this
excellency attending him, namely, that he was always readiest
and most apt to direct and encourage us in cases of the most
danger. We advanced immediately with what speed we could
and gained that little wood, the Tartars, or thieves, for we know
not what to call them, keeping their stand, and not attempting
to hinder us. When we came thither, we found to our great
satisfaction that it was a swampy, springy piece of ground, and
on the one side a very great spring of water, which running out
in a little rill or brook, was a little farther joined by another
of the like bigness, and was, in short, the head or source of a
considerable river, called afterwards the Wirtska. The trees
which grew about this spring were not in all above two hundred,
but were very large, and stood pretty thick, so that as soon as
we got in we saw ourselves perfectly safe from the enemy,
unless they alighted and attacked us on foot. But to make
this more difficult our Portuguese, with indefatigable applica-
tion, cut down great arms of the trees, and laid them hanging,
not quite cut off, from one tree to another, so that he made a
continued fence almost round us.
We stayed here waiting the motion of the enemy some
hours, without perceiving they made any motion; when, about
two hours before night, they came down directly upon us; and
though we had not perceived it, we found they had been joined
by some more of the same, so that they were near fourscore
horse, whereof, however, we fancied some were women. They
came on till they were within half shot of our little wood, when
we fired one musket without ball, and called to them in the
Russian tongue to know what they wanted, and bid them keep
off; but as if they knew nothing of what we said, they came
on with a double fury directly up to the wood-side, not imagin-
ing we were so barricaded that they could not break in. Our
old pilot was our captain, as well as he had been our engineer,
and desired of us not to fire upon them till they came within
pistol-shot, and that we might be sure to kill, and that when
we did fire we should be sure to take good aim. We bade him
give the word of command, which he delayed so long that they
were within two pikes' length of us when we fired.
We aimed so true, or Providence directed our shot so sure,
that we killed fourteen of them and wounded several others,
as also several of their horses; for we had all of us loaded our
pieces with two or three bullets at least.
They were terribly surprised with our fire, and retreated
immediately about one hundred rods from us, in which time we
loaded our pieces again, and seeing them keep that distance,
we sallied out, and catched four or five of their horses, whose
riders, we suppose, were killed; and coming up to the dead, we
could easily perceive they were Tartars, but knew not from
what country, or how they came to make an excursion such an
unusual length.
About an hour after they made a motion to attack us again,
and rode round our little wood to see where else they might
break in; but finding us always ready to face them, they went
off again, and we resolved not to stir from the place for that
night. We slept little you may be sure, but spent the most part
of the nightjn strengthening our situation, and barricading the
entrances into the wood, and keeping a strict watch. We
waited for daylight, and when it came, it gave us a very un-
welcome discovery indeed; for the enemy, whom we thought
were discouraged with the reception they had met with, were
now increased to no less than three hundred, and had set up
eleven or twelve huts and tents, as if they were resolved to
besiege us; and this little camp they had pitched upon the
open plain, at about three-quarters of a mile from us. We were
indeed surprised at this discovery; and now, I confess, I gave
myself over for lost, and all that I had. The loss of my effects
did not He so near me, though they were very considerable, as
the thoughts of falling into the hands of such barbarians at the
latter end of my journey, after so many difficulties and hazards
as I had gone through, and even in sight of our port, where we
expected safety and deliverance. As for my partner, he was
raging; he declared that to lose his goods would be his ruin,
and he would rather die than be starved, and he was for fight-
ing to the last drop.
The young lord, as gallant as ever flesh showed itself, was
for fighting to the last also; and my old pilot was of the
opinion we were able to resist them all in the situation we were
then in, and thus we spent the day in debates of what we
should do; but towards evening we found that the number of
our enemies still increased. Perhaps, as they were abroad in
several parties for prey, the first had sent out scouts to call for
help, and to acquaint them of the booty; and we did not know
but by the morning they might still be a greater number; so I
began to inquire of those people we had brought from Tobolsk
if there was no other, or more private ways, by which we might
avoid them in the night, and perhaps either retreat to some
town, or get help to guard us over the desert.
The Siberian, who was servant to the young lord, told us if
we designed to avoid them and not fight, he would engage to
carry us off in the night to a way that went north towards the
Petrov, by which he made no question but we might get away,
and the Tartars never the wiser, but he said his lord had told
him he would not retreat, but would rather choose to fight. 1
told him he mistook his lord, for that he was too wise a man to
love fighting for the sake of it; that I knew his lord was brave
enough by what he had showed already; but that his lord
knew better than to desire to have seventeen or eighteen men
fight five hundred, unless an unavoidable necessity forced them
to it; and that if he thought it possible for us to escape in the
night, we had nothing else to do but to attempt it. He
answered, if his lord gave him such orders, he would lose his life
if he did not perform it. We soon brought his lord to give
that order, though privately, and we immediately prepared for
the putting it in practice.
And first, as soon as it began to be dark we kindled a fire
in our little camp, which we kept burning, and prepared so as
to make it burn all night, that the Tartars might conclude we
were still there; but as soon as it was dark, that is to say, so
as we could see the stars, for our guide would not stir before,
having all our horses and camels ready loaded, we followed
our new guide, who, I soon found, steered himself by the pole
or north star, all the country being level for a long way.
After we had travelled two hours very hard it began to be
lighter still, not that it was quite dark all night, but the moon
began to rise, so that, in a word, it was rather lighter than we
wished it to be ; by six o'clock the next morning we were
gotten near forty miles, though the truth is we almost spoiled
our horses. Here we found a Russian village named
Kermazinskoy [ ? Kertchemskoy ], where we rested, and heard
nothing of the Kalmuck Tartars that day. About two hours
before night we set out again, and travelled till eight the next
morning,though not quite so quiet as before; and about seven
o'clock we passed a little river called Kirtza, and came to a
good large town inhabited by Russians, and very populous,
called Ozomoys [?]. There we heard that several troops or
hordes of Kalmucks had been abroad upon the desert, but that
we were now completely out of danger of them, which was to
our great satisfaction, you may be sure. Here we were obliged
to get some fresh horses, and having need enough of rest, we
stayed five days; and my partner and I agreed to give the
honest Siberian who brought us thither the value of ten pistols
for his conducting us.
In five days more we came to Veuslima [?], upon the river
Vychegda, and running into the Dwina; we were there very
happily near the end of our travels by land, that river being
navigable in seven days' passage to Archangel. From hence
we came to Lawrenskoy [? Jarensk] the 3rd of July, and
providing ourselves with two luggage-boats and a barge for
our own convenience, we embarked the 7th, and arrived all safe
at Archangel the i8th, having been a year and five months and
three days on the journey, including our stay of eight months
and odd days at Tobolsk.
We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the
arrival of the ships, and must have tarried longer had not a
Hamburger come in above a month sooner than any of the
English ships, when, after some consideration that the city of
Hamburg might happen to be as good a market for our goods
as London, we all took freight with him; and having put my
goods on board, it was most natural for me to put my steward
on board to take care of them, by which means my young lord
had a sufficient opportunity to conceal himself, never coming
on shore in all the time we stayed there; and this he did, that
he might not be seen in the city, where some of the Moscow
merchants would certainly have seen and discovered him.
We sailed from Archangel the 2Oth of August the same
year, and after no extraordinary bad voyage arrived in the
Elbe the ijth of September. Here my partner and I found a
very good sale for our goods, as well those of China as the
sables, &c., of Siberia; and dividing the produce of our effects,
my share amounted to £3475, 175. 3d., notwithstanding so
many losses we had sustained, and charges we had been at;
only remembering that I had in this about six hundred pounds'
worth of diamonds, which I had purchased at Bengal.
Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went up the
Elbe in order to go to the court of Vienna, where he resolved
to seek protection, and where he could correspond with those
of his father's friends who were left alive. He did not part
without all the testimonies he could give me of gratitude for
the service I had done him, and his sense of my kindness to
the prince his father.
To conclude. Having stayed near four months in Hamburg,
I came from thence overland to the Hague, where I embarked
in the packet, and arrived in London the loth of January 1705,
having been gone from England ten years and nine months.
And here resolving to harass myself no more, I am
preparing for a longer journey than all these, having lived
seventy-two years a life of infinite variety, and learnt sufficiently
to know the value of retirement, and the blessing of ending
our days in peace.
