live.4 He reckoned it harsh, forsooth, that this celes-
tial animal, on which they have bestowed the name
of man5 because it presents, as it were, a kind of
earthly copy of divine Providence, founds and estab-
lishes cities, wages wars, regulates peace, examines
and considers the diversities of events, and from them
determines what may be of use to itself and others:
that this being should live for one moment, but ever
after abide in the darkness of death, while all its
deeds end and perish with it. There was in his great
and lofty spirit a glowing ardent desire for immor-
tality. This desire took its origin and beginning, not
4 "Itaque Themistoclem, cum annos natus centum et septem
moreretur, cum natura expostulasse accepimus; quod tunc egredi-
endum esset a vita, quando usu longo sapere didicisset." Isaac
Casaubon, preface to his edition of Polybius (1609), p. [3].
"Clarissimus e Graeciae imperatoribus Themistocles, transmissis
vitae annis centum ac septem, lineas iam fieri propiores sentiens,
indoluit: turn sibi demigrandum, sapere quum praecipue esset
exorsus." Lodovicus Caelius Rhodiginus, Antiquae Lectiones, [nova
editio] (Basileae, 1542), i, lib. xxx, cap. ii (p. 1148). I have not
traced the anecdote further back. The nearest analogue that I know
in classical writers is Cicero, De Senectute, 5, 13, where Gorgias of
Leontini is assigned the same age but a different saying: "Nihil
habeo quod accusem senectutem." See other versions of the saying
of Gorgias in H. E. Foss, De Gorgia Leontino Commentatio (Halis
Saxonum, 1828), pp. 37 f. Cotton Mather's reference is marred by
a misprint. Magnolia, bk. ii, p. 20.
"Cicero, De Legibus, i, 7, 22: "animal hoc providum, sagax,
multiplex, acutum, memor, plenum rationis et consilii, quern vo-
camus hominem." De Finibus, ii, 13, 40: "hominem . . . hoc
divinum animal."
from the perishable body, which, deprived of vital
heat, returns to earth of its own accord, like the
boughs and fruits of trees, but from that graft of the
divine. A man worthy of that immortality to which
he so strongly aspired, he saw that practical wisdom,
the rule and pattern of human life, has its seat upon
a lofty height; that one cannot attain to it except by
certain steps; and that these steps are the deeds of
men. Unless these are preserved, and set forth in
clear light for all to see, necessarily men must ever
live as tiros, and depart from this life in ignorance
of the purposes for which they are born.
Now if some god should grant mortals this privi-
lege, that, before they enter upon the management
of affairs, the government of cities, the administration
of office, they might, in order that they may not make
the wonted complaint of the brevity of life, the
variety of peoples and understandings, their condition
and the incertitude of events, the power of fortune
in human affairs, and other matters, to which men
are hardly able to attain without examples, singly
and once ascend a steep cliff, whence they might
behold and survey the peoples of the whole earth, of
all ages and generations, and their manners and
character, the wars of princes, the laws of the pru-
dent, the situation of countries and cities, all coun-
sels, all actions and their results: truly, gentlemen,
they would think themselves fortunate indeed! Truly

that fretful animal, whom we call man, because in
life itself he ever touches only the fringes of life,8
would for once acquit of blame that Supreme Divin-
ity, whose greatness he does not understand, and
whose kindness he is quick to accuse.
He would be freed from the limits of time and
space. Unhampered by the difficulties of travel, he
would approach everything, he would be present
without danger at all wars and events, he would
gather into one focus the immeasurably great vast-
ness of ages and generations. He would view in a
moment an infinite multitude of matters and affairs.
He would scan the affairs of the Egyptians, which
are considered the most ancient,7 of the Persians,
thought to have been the richest, of the Romans,
justly reckoned to have been the greatest. He would
still behold Themistocles, whom we know to have
been active more than two thousand years ago. The
trophies of Miltiades, which did not allow Themis-
tocles to sleep,8 he would see in their pristine fresh-
ness. He would attend the assemblies of the Atheni-
ans, the deliberations of the Lacedaemonians, the
Roman Senate. To him nothing would be hidden by

time, inaccessible through distance, closed by situa-
tion. The designs, too, and the secrets of empire,
which lie concealed in the minds of kings and princes
as in a hidden shrine, he would gather directly from
the event, exactly like a physician who conducts a
post mortem examination upon the human body. He
would cast his mental eye upon the inner counsels
and arts of war, which the Greeks call stratagems.
This privilege, gentlemen, not to lead you too far
away, is History. History, surest pledge of the kind-
ness of God to man, mother of truth, pattern of life,
preserver of actions, and, as one among the Greeks
says, metropolis of practical wisdom.9 History ren-
ders man contemporary with the universe. She trans-
mits to posterity the likeness, not of the body, but
of the life, the counsels, the soul, and presents it to
the view of all, copied not in bronze or iron, not by
the aid of picture or statue, but in monuments of
letters, by the imperishable resources of facts and
words.
If you have regard to elegance or delightfulness,
you will find there river or spring, here grove or
field, so painted in vivid colors that mother Nature
comes to doubt her right of property, and the charm
of language vies with the innate character and genius
of things. Do you have regard rather to weight or

moral value? There indeed she reigns, there she re-
veals her high nobility. Almost alone, she shows
what it is to be just and fair, what it is to be temper-
ate and liberal, what is the duty of a judge, what of a
senator, what are the qualifications and functions
of a general despatched to war: all much better
shown by examples than by the precepts of a philos-
opher.
Political science belongs wholly to History. The
historian seeks material only from his own field.10
On the other hand, political science, without History,
is tortured and almost wasted away by tasteless, dis-
gusting, and pedantic distinctions and minute divi-
sions of philosophers. Separated also from human
actions, exiled from her home, she is not read in
states, where her kingdom is, but perishes where she
had her birth, in the dust of the schools.
I think, however, that the most important thing is
the fellowship which History has with our mind and
soul. These she so nourishes and influences that she
seems to claim them for herself and to possess them
almost in entirety. The reason of this must be sought
from the very nature and origin of the soul. We see
children, when first they begin to understand, listen
so eagerly to little stories that sometimes they do not
even have time to cry. Philosophers too, as Aristotle
notes in the first book of the Metaphysics, enjoy
10 "Assisted by no strengths but are her owne." Infra, p. 34.
stories for the same reason.11 Moreover, as the indi-
vidual stars are said by the Peripatetics to be moved
with their world, so our mind, when she listens to
narratives, not only is forgetful of herself, but seems
to wander away from herself, as it were, and to de-
part, and to be attached to the things narrated, and
not so much to read the particulars as to act them,
which, sirs, is an incredible and almost inexpressible
pleasure and happiness. If she is occupied with
Roman history, she swims with Cocles,12 ploughs
with Quinctius,13 delays with Fabius;14 with Marcel-
lus she attacks the Carthaginian,15 with Nero, Has-
drubal.16 If in Greek history, she goes to battle with
Themistocles at sea,17 with Lysander on land,18 she
flees with Aristides,19 she is imprisoned with Cimon.20
If we must speak of the value of History, I should
hope, sirs, yes, I should earnestly hope, that they

who, to the extent of their ability, try to bring letters
and these humane studies into contempt, would either
acquit all equally, or condemn History equally with
them. I trust that this will not annoy them. I hope
that they will grant it willingly.
They who are versed in the majestic and austere
science of the law rightly exalt it, but they unjustly
disparage other sciences, or consider them unworthy
of a man of weight. Of them we do not ask that they
appraise History in the light of the dependence upon
it of Jurisprudence herself. We are not beggars,21 we
demand only our own. But we do ask that they look
to their laws to the best of their ability, leaving His-
tory to us and to princes. With pride we say it: If
History have no professorship, if all universities be
closed, she will always have a hospitable reception in
palaces and in the innermost chambers of kings and
princes. She is the inseparable companion of their
minds, their counsels, and their deeds. In camps,
amid trumpets and the clash of arms, as witness
Scipio,22 where laws, as the proverb tells us, must be
silent,23 she will find place. For I must make it clear
that the exposition of History made for the benefit
of kings and princes is not the same as that which we
make to you. For you, we must sometimes stick
21 Mendicabula hominum. Cf. Plautus, Aultdaria, iv, 7, v. 3.

closely to details, we must continually examine an-
tiquities, we must sometimes cite parallel passages of
authors. But he who would undertake before kings
and princes the exposition of a great historian, such
as, e.g., Polybius or Livy, would certainly resolve
upon a quite different system. He would take all
civil and military knowledge as his province. He
would treat of the education and training of a prince,
of the best order and manner of ruling, of the func-
tion and office of an ambassador. On this there was
a whole section, a great part of which has survived,
in the Pandects of Porphyrogenitus, which the great
emperor, imitating Justinian, compiled from the his-
torians.24 He would treat of the storming of walls
and the establishment of posts. He would teach the
time for assaults and the time for luring forth the
enemy. He would discuss standards, ambuscades,
guards of the gates, the arrangement of the watches.
He would discuss the ordering of the battle-array,
movement in order of battle; he would explain the
nature of the double and of the triple line. If it were
24 The reference is to the great encyclopaedia of history and
political science prepared at the command of the Eastern Emperor
Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (912-959). In this work selec-
tions from Greek and Byzantine historians were arranged in fifty-
three sections, classified by subjects. Much has been lost. The
twenty-seventh section, on embassies, was edited by Fulvius
Ursinus, Selecta de Legationibus (Antverpiae, 1582), containing
selections mostly from Polybius, and by David Hoeschel, Eclogae
Legationum (Augustae Vindelicorum, 1603).
his purpose to give a comparative view of ancient
and modern warfare, he would describe accurately
all machines, catapults, rams, ballistae, scorpions,
movable bridges, fascines, mantlets, pent-houses, and
other things of that sort, and would compare with
these our systems of siege warfare.
If we do not handle these matters with elabora-
tion, if we teach some things which are of less weight,
this does not take away from the dignity of History,
as I believe, but is our contribution to your advan-
tage and profit. Precedent requires that our field be
given this extension. Again, although all History is
magnificent, illustrious, broad, and therefore pleas-
ing, yet beyond other things the splendor of the
Roman people and the majesty peculiar to that race,
whereof Greeklings have never even uttered the
name, awaken and captivate us to a great degree, so
that they seem to have passed over from the empire
itself and the invincible city to its authors, especially
the historians. Manifestly the immortal gods could
not endure that the splendor of the Roman people
should perish. Virtue and Fortune alike had prom-
ised eternity to that splendor. Arisen from certain
fables and absurdities almost poetic, it was to mount
above all the greatness of all kingdoms and empires.
Who, indeed, is so utterly listless, who lives so in-
active and slothful, as not to be roused by the mere
name and memory of that city, which with universal
consent is called by the ancients sum and substance
of the world, the world's miracle? Again: Whose
mind is not fed, aye, to repletion, who reads of Ca-
milli, Fabii, Fabricii, Nasicas, Scipios, Curios, names
not so much of men as of virtues? Who is not stimu-
lated and filled with boundless delight, when he hath
withdrawn himself unto that nation from which we
have received the power and patterns of virtue, not,
as in the writings of the Greeks, by discussion, but
described and delineated by very life and deeds? Its
language is almost vernacular with us; we all use its
laws and justice; its relics on rocks and stones we
wellnigh worship. Indeed, sirs, I do not deny that I
am returning as it were into my home country from
the long journey which I have made during the past
several years through almost all Greece.25 And just
Heinsius's first appointment in the University of Leyden was
in 1602, while he was yet a student, to teach poetry, i.e., Greek
and Latin poetry. Bronnen tot it Geschiedenis der Leidsche Uni-
versiteit, ed. P. C. Molhuysen, i, 1574-1610 (the Hague, 1913),
pp. 142, 408* f. May 11, 1603, he was appointed extraordinarius
Professor Poeseos at a salary of 400 florins. Ibid., p. 151. Febru-
ary 8/9, 1605, he was made titular professor of the Greek Language,
at 700 florins per annum. Ibid., p. 159. February 8, 9, 10, 1609, it
was voted that in the absence of Bonaventura Vulcanius he was to
be regarded as professor ordinarius of the same subject. Ibid.,
p. 181. February 8, 1612: "Is D. Danieli Heinsio, professori

as Homer's Ulysses, when he sees that he has reached
Ithaca, embraces the sod, salutes the Nymphs, and
venerates with particular joy and delight the places
he had so often longed for:26 so is it with me, when
I behold this city, and see myself brought anew to
all those things which as a youth I contemplated
diligently of yore. And indeed I deem that I have
entered the Roman state not as a sojourner, but as a
citizen by right of recovery.27 No outlaw was I,
gentlemen, nor did I lose meanwhile full Roman
rights and citizenship, but I dwelt in Greece for the
sake of understanding and learning, and to survey
all sciences. Now — may the event be happy! —I
behold Rome with eager eyes, even as those Romans
who returned into their native land from Athens,
after they had betaken themselves thither for their
studies.28 I must say,
All hail, great parent both of gods and men,

the beginnings. This, gentlemen, ye shall do with me
in Lucius Annaeus Florus. Indeed, who will not
wonder that the one hut of Romulus hath brought
forth so many temples, so many buildings, so many
structures, excelling the condition of man? Who is
not stricken with amazement when he considers and
reads that the founders of universal empire, neg-
lected by men, were preserved by a wild beast?30
Who does not rejoice to believe that Father Tiber
held back the stream when they were there cast
away?31 As the origin of Rome seems to have over-
stepped the bounds of nature, afterwards its splendor
and power surpassed the limits of the whole earth.
When we see a man endowed with unusual excel-
lence, who by arms or understanding hath achieved
a renowned and famous name, we seek with a kind
of delight for complete knowledge of his infancy and
childish toys. In the same way, he who admires the
imperial dignity of Rome is somehow more delighted
by her beginnings. So that it is with incredible zeal
that he hears and reads of Evanders,32 too, of Fauni,33
Faustuli,34 and Accas.35 This way we also shall
tread. We shall proceed from the earliest childhood

of the mistress of the world to the fulness and ripe-
ness of her age. We shall come down from shepherds
to kings, from kings to liberty, from liberty to those
times in which the greatness of vices balanced the
greatness of empire and destroyed it as well. Not
only men shall we see, but also clans, the Valerian,
Postumian, Papirian, Quinctian, and preeminently
the Fabian, Curian, Fabrician. These seem to me
fallen from heaven with their shields,36 or born and
reared of Virtue herself. Next we shall view the Civil
Wars, and ambition, most powerful of all evils:
which, first arisen between brothers, soon comes to
others. As in a picture, we shall behold the life of
the Roman people, its manners, efforts, but especially
its wars and battles. These our Florus has minuted
with care, so far as his concise brevity permitted.
Sometimes ye have heard Dominicus Baudius ex-
pound him from this place: a man quite comparable
with antiquity, and of memory so strong, as to carry
about, as if in a capacious purse, all histories and
all annals, modern and ancient. To me, indeed, he
left nothing except his love strong beyond belief,
which he committed to me at his dying hour, and
this position, so that my very incapacity might re-
sult to his praise and reputation. For his part, he
used to seek from History all his glory, praise, and
"See Livy, i, 20, 4, "caelestia arma, quae ancilia appellantur,"

reputation, as well in lectures as in writing. In her
he lives, in her he speaks with us, in her he survives,
in her we have his genius and pleasantry, in her we
seem to look upon him face to face. Through her,
finally, he procured honor for his country, for him-
self life after death. O divine power and dignity of
letters! O preserver of men, preserver of men's
deeds, preserver of chronology, preserver of all the
centuries, of all years and generations the preserver,
History! In thee Greece applies herself to philoso-
phy, in thee Rome still rules, in thee likewise she
waxes and flowers, begins and ends: Brutus over-
throws the kingdom, Romulus founds it: Cocles
plucks out the bridge, Mucius burns his hand:
Cloelia swims, Lucretia is outraged. Hannibal lays
waste Italy, Scipio, Carthage: Crassus is slain among
the Parthians, Pompey in Egypt, Caesar in the Sen-
ate Chamber by the armed citizens, Cato gives his
life for liberty. Through thee whatever has been, is,
while whatever is, never ceases to be. Through thee
the people has its customs, the soothsayers their
sacred rites, the magistrates their badges of office.
Through thee the city has its regions, aqueducts,
blocks, and streets; only in thee it has its walls and
boundaries. The very patron deities also, and mother
Vesta, and the eternal fires, and Tarpeian Jupiter,
and the Seven Hills, are never seen except in History.
To the hundred and seven years of Themistocles,

who complained that he had lived so short a time,
thou hast added all eternity. Again: Thou hast made
Alexander the Great, whose life was quenched by
the envy of the Fates within his thirty-third year,
still survive with the world over which he triumphed.
Go, now, Kings and Princes, go, and put your
trophies elsewhere than in the eternity of letters.
Believe that some rock or stone can avail against
the long continuance of time. Poets, orators, and
especialy historians, the peculiar ministers of the
Muses, and priests of eternity, heralds also of your
glory and name — neglect these, if ye see fit, and
in their places load with benefits a monkey or a fool.
The very empress of nations is now nowhere except
in History. Lady and princess of the whole world,
she beholds her majesty nowhere save in letters.
When, again, we see that so many statues have
perished there, so many arches, temples, porticos,
basilicas, tombs, courts, columns, in hope of eternity
consecrated within or without the city by the rulers
of the world: that even those wrought in adamant,
if such there were, are now gone (adamant, which
they call hardest of metals, and in which, the poets
declare, the destined decrees of the Fates were cut
because of its extreme rigidity): what then shall I
conclude, except that rocks, iron, lead, and brass, aye,
the very arts to which they turn for preservation,
lie prostrate beneath the power and majesty of the
human understanding? Or, indeed, if any one of you
has examined History, he can not be ignorant of the
Theatre of Pompey.37 Here is a case where, it seems
to me, a number of princes, Giant-fashion, have
measured their strength with time. Pompey, for-
sooth, had built it to last. It was wasted and de-
stroyed. Tiberius restored it. Caligula completed it.
Burned a second time, Claudius rebuilt it. Next it
was ruined by age, and Theodoric built it again.
Where is it now, gentlemen? It would have faded
even from remembrance, had History permitted.
They say that Cnaeus Octavius 38 gave his exploits
to workmen to be depicted with the utmost care on a
vast portico, which, from the produce of spoil, he
built as if to last forever. Where do you find any
traces of it, except in literature? We see that noth-
ing has escaped from such great ruins, nothing from
the hands of the Goths and the furies of the Vandals,
nothing from the shipwreck of fortune, the long con-
tinuance of time, and the storm of war, except only
the monuments of mind and intellect. Nay also, we
see that in agriculture and architecture all the con-

temporary works of man 39 shall perish, unless we
historians claim them as our own. Moreover we
perceive that of this brief and perishing life by far
the greatest part, our fame and reputation, looks
toward posterity. Therefore, sirs, let us take a nobler,
loftier courage. Let us cherish this brief time, this
moment, which God hath prepared for the cultiva-
tion of this great trust, History. In her reside for us
and for almost all created things glory, memory, and
dignity, and finally the destined keystone of eternity
itself. So in surpassing the law of our mortality
under the will and favor of God immortal, who hath
given us the means of perpetuity, we may seem to
have conferred life and eternity upon all others.
This must be looked for from History almost alone.
Gentlemen, I return to you my heartiest thanks,
that ye have listened thus far to my remarks on the
value of History. But especially I thank thee, most
noble ambassador,40 true portrait of thy king and
express image of his majesty, that, imitating Pompey
the Great, thou hast deigned in thy grandeur to

over the praise of History, it might have been neces-
sary that I urge all to pursue and embrace the study
of her. For men have no readier means of correcting
their knowledge of the past. But since not some, nor
a part, but practically all, have begun and ended in
developing this theme: affirming that the study of
History is the truest education and training for
public affairs; and that the most instructive, indeed
the only method of learning to endure nobly the
vicissitudes of fortune is to recall the reverses of
others: it is evident that no one need think he ought
to repeat what many have said well. Polybius, His-
toriae, i, 1, 1-3.

OF HISTORY 31
And Thucydides appears to assert this of history,
that history also is philosophy teaching from ex-
amples: "I shall be content if those shall pronounce
my history useful who desire to get a view of events
as they did really happen, and as they are very likely,
in accordance with human nature, to repeat them-
selves at some future time — if not exactly the same,
yet very similar." 'Dionysius of Halicarnassus,' Ars
Rhetorica, xi, 2, quoting Thucydides, i, 22, 4. I have
adopted the emendation of Stephanus as to the posi-
tion of \4ya>v, since Bolingbroke's rendering, given
below, seems to match his text most closely.

is a good thing to be able to make use of the mistakes
of others as examples for avoidance, and in the
events of life not to have to seek expedients, but
rather to imitate precedents. And surely all prefer
old men to young men in counsel, because of the ex-
perience which time has given them. But the knowl-
edge derived from History surpasses the experience
of old men as much as we know it excels it in multi-
tude of examples. Accordingly one might consider
History a most profitable coadjutor for all the occa-
sions of life. For it preserves for young men the
sagacity of the old, while for the old it multiplies
many times the knowledge they have acquired. It
prepares private citizens for posts of command. It
impels princes to attempt the most honorable deeds
for a glorious immortality. Furthermore, it makes
soldiers, in the hope of commendation after death,
more ready to meet peril for their country, while by
the fear of eternal reprobation it dissuades wicked
men from the impulse to evil. Diodorus Siculus,

History, most high and mighty Sovereign, is truly
approved to be the Treasure of Times past, the Light
of Truth, the Memory of Life, the Guide and Image
of Man's present Estate, Pattern of Things to come,
and the true Work-mistress of Experience, the
Mother of Knowledge; for therein, as in a Crystal,
there is not only presented unto our Views the Vir-
tues, but the Vices; the Perfections, but the Defects;
the Good, but the Evil; the Lives, but the Death, of
all precedent Governors and Government, which

'"The Minde of the Front" is substantially a description of the
emblematic engraved title-page which it faces in Raleigh's History.
In the foreground History, Magistra vitce, faces the reader, her feet
upon Mors and Oblivio, holding above her head the globe of the
world. Still above this is the all-seeing eye of Providentia. Behind
the figure of History is a temple inscribed The History of the
World. On the roof, a world apart, are Fama bona and Fama mala,
winged figures with trumpets, the latter covered with spots. At
the right of History is Experientia, with measuring wand and plumb

besides it nothing but eternity hath triumphed over:
for it hath carried our knowledge over the vast and

we plainly behold . . . how Kings and Kingdomes
have flourished and fallen, and for what vertue and
piety God made prosperous, and for what vice and
deformity he made wretched, both the one and the
other. And it is not the least debt which we owe
unto History that it hath made us acquainted with
our dead Ancestors, and out of the depth and darke-
nesse of the earth delivered us their memory and
fame. Ibid., preface.

Renold Elstracke from Raleigh's design.

Your lordship may . . . ask me, what then is the
true use of history? in what respects it may serve to
make us better and wiser? and what method is to be
pursued in the study of it, for attaining these great
ends? I will answer you by quoting what I have read
somewhere or other, in Dionysius Halicarn, I think,
that history is philosophy teaching by examples. We
need but to cast our eyes on the world, and we shall
"'Historians Literariam' is understood as the object of 'Sequitur.'
see the daily force of example: we need but to turn
them inward, and we shall soon see why example
has this force. "Pauci prudentia," says Tacitus,

Here by the past to form the rising age,
The grave Historian spreads his ample page;
Whose faithful care preserves the Hero's fame,
Or damns to infamy the Traitor's name;
Whose Records bid fair Virtue ever live;
And share immortal in the life they give.
Samuel Bishop, "The Library," in his Poems, third
ed. (London, 1802, 2 vols.), i, pp. 74 f.
* Mill's reference is to Lessing's famous work, Die Erziehung des
Menschengeschlechts ('The Education of the Human Race') (Berlin,
1780), which Lord Acton considers "the first attempt to give unity
to universal history by the application of a philosophic system."
Essays and Studies (London, 1907), p. 327. Coleridge uses the
phrase "the education of the mind of the race" in a like sense. The
Friend (London, 1818), iii, p. 233.
21
History, at least in its state of ideal perfection, is
a compound of poetry and philosophy. It impresses
general truths on the mind by a vivid representation
of particular characters and incidents. But, in fact,
the two hostile elements of which it consists have
never been known to form a perfect amalgamation.
T. B. Macaulay, "Hallam" (1828), in his Critical
and Historical Essays (London, 1843, 3 vols.), i,
p. 113.
22
The perfect historian is he in whose work the
character and spirit of an age is exhibited in minia-
ture. He relates no fact, he attributes no expression
to his characters, which is not authenticated by suf-
ficient testimony. But by judicious selection, rejec-
tion, and arrangement, he gives to truth those attrac-
tions which have been usurped by fiction. In his
narrative a due subordination is observed; some
transactions are prominent, others retire. But the
scale on which he represents them is increased or
diminished, not according to the dignity of the per-
sons concerned in them, but according to the degree
in which they elucidate the condition of society and
the nature of man. He shows us the court, the camp,
and the senate. But he shows us also the nation. He
considers no anecdote, no peculiarity of manner, no
familiar saying, as too insignificant for his notice,
which is not too insignificant to illustrate the oper-
ation of laws, of religion, and of education, and to
mark the progress of the human mind. Men will not
merely be described, but will be made intimately
known to us. The changes of manners will be indi-
cated, not merely by a few general phrases, or a few
extracts from statistical documents, but by appropri-
ate images presented in every line.
If a man, such as we are supposing, should write
the history of England, he would assuredly not omit
the battles, the sieges, the negotiations, the seditions,
the ministerial changes. But with these he would
intersperse the details which are the charm of his-
torical romances. At Lincoln Cathedral there is a
beautiful painted window, which was made by an
apprentice out of the pieces of glass which had been
rejected by his master. It is so far superior to every
other in the church, that, according to the tradition,
the vanquished artist killed himself from mortifica-
tion. Sir Walter Scott, in the same manner, has used
those fragments of truth which historians have scorn-
fully thrown behind them, in a manner which may
well excite their envy. He has constructed out of
their gleanings works which, even considered as his-
tories, are scarcely less valuable than theirs. But a
truly great historian would reclaim those materials
which the novelist has appropriated. The history of
the government, and the history of the people, would
be exhibited in that mode in which alone they can be
exhibited justly, in inseparable conjunction and inter-
mixture. We should not then have to look for the
wars and votes of the Puritans in Clarendon, and for
their phraseology in Old Mortality; for one half of
King James in Hume, and for the other half in the
Fortunes of Nigel. Idem, "History," in The Edin-
burgh Review, May, 1828, pp. 364 f.
23
These historical novels have taught all men this
truth, which looks like a truism, and yet was as good
as unknown to writers of history and others, till so
taught: that the bygone ages of the world were actu-
ally filled by living men, not by protocols, state-
papers, controversies, and abstractions of men. Not
abstractions were they, not diagrams and theorems;
but men, in buff or other coats and breeches, with
color in their cheeks, with passions in their stomach,
and the idioms, features, and vitalities of very men.
It is a little word this; inclusive of great meaning!
History will henceforth have to take thought of it.
Her faint hearsays of 'philosophy teaching by ex-
perience' will have to exchange themselves every-
where for direct inspection and imbodiment: this,
and this only, will be counted experience; and till
once experience have got in, philosophy will recon-
cile herself to wait at the door. Thomas Carlyle, re-
view of J. G. Lockhart's Life of Sir Walter Scott, in
The London and Westminster Review, January,
1838, pp. 337 f.
24
Above all things, the historian must get out of his
own age into the time in which he is writing. Imagi-
nation is as much needed for the historian as the
poet. You may combine bits of books with other
bits of books, and so make some new combinations,
and this may be done accurately; and, in general,
much of the subordinate preparation for history may
be accomplished without any great effort of imagina-
tion. But to write history, in any large sense of the
words, you must be able to comprehend other times.
You must know that there is a right and wrong which
is not your right and wrong, but yet stands upon the
right and wrong of all ages and all hearts. You must
also appreciate the outward life and colors of the
period you write about. Try to think how the men
you are telling of would have spent a day, what were
their leading ideas: what they cared about. Grasp
the body of the time, and give it to us. If not, and
these men could look at your history, they would
say, "This is all very well; we dare say some of these
things did happen; but we were not thinking of these
things all day long. It does not represent us."
After enlarging upon this great requisite, imagina-
tion, it seems somewhat prosaic to come down to
saying that history requires accuracy. But I think
I hear the sighs, and sounds more harsh than sigh-
ing, of those who have ever investigated any thing,
and found by dire experience the deplorable inac-
curacy which prevails in the world. And, therefore,
I would say to the historian almost as the first sug-
gestion, "Be accurate; do not make false references,
do not mis-state: and men, if they get no light from
you, will not execrate you. You will not stand in the
way and have to be explained and got rid of." Arthur
Helps, Friends in Council, book the first (London,
1848), pp. 214 f.

The true subjective history of man is the history
not of his thought, but of his conscience; the true
objective history of man is not that of his inventions,
but of his vices and his virtues. Charles Kingsley,
The Limits of Exact Science as Applied to History
(Cambridge and London, 1860), p. 55.
26
We shall find, as I believe, in all the ages, God
educating man; protecting him till he can go alone,
furnishing him with the primary necessaries, teach-
ing him, guiding him, inspiring him, as we should do
to our children; bearing with him, and forgiving him
too, again and again, as we should do: but teaching
him withal (as we shall do if we be wise) in great
part by his own experience, making him test for him-
self, even by failure and pain, the truth of the laws
which have been given him; discover for himself, as
much as possible, fresh laws, or fresh applications
of laws; and exercising his will and faculties, by
trusting him to himself wherever he can be trusted
without his final destruction. This is my conception
of history. Ibid., p. 62.
27
I consider . . . that history has to do with the
state, that it investigates the growth and changes of
a certain corporate society, which acts through cer-
tain functionaries and certain assemblies. By the
nature of the state every person who lives in a certain
territory is usually a member of it, but history is not
concerned with individuals except in their capacity
of members of a state. That a man in England makes
a scientific discovery or paints a picture, is not in
itself an event in the history of England. J. R. Seeley,
The Expansion of England (London, 1883), pp. 6 f.
28
If I were called on to do so, I should be most in-
clined to give some such definition as this; to say that
history is the science of man in his character as a
political being. E. A. Freeman, Methods of Histo-
rical Study (London, 1886), p. 117.
29
Two views prevail concerning the scope of history.
One regards it, to use the expression of an eminent
living writer, as being concerned solely with states,
so that (in the words of another distinguished con-
temporary) "history is past politics, and politics is
present history." 7 The other, which has found illus-
trious exponents from Herodotus downwards, con-
ceives it to be a picture of the whole past, including
everything that man has either thought or wrought.
Of these views the former appears to us narrow, and
therefore misleading; the latter so wide as to become
vague, fixing no definite limit to the province of his-
tory as bordering on other fields of learning. It seems
better to regard history as the record of human
action, and of thought only in its direct influence
upon action. James Bryce, in English Historical Re-
view, January, 1886, prefatory note.
3°
History is the knowledge of things that live and
move. Lord Acton, "German Schools of History," in
English Historical Review, January, 1886, p. 24.
'E. A. Freeman, The Office of the Historical Professor (London,
1884), p. 13.

31
I do not know that history can be limited to poli-
tics. The Greek word icrropia means inquiry, and
history is properly any inquiry into the past. Of
course our curiosity is about different things at dif-
ferent times. But we want to find in any period what S
was most important in it: and we want also to bring
it into some relation to ourselves at present. Politics,
1 suppose, means the organization of society by the
state: but we often want to know more than that;
literature, art, ideas, religion, all have their place,
and some periods are entirely engaged with them.
Of course all these things pass into society, but we
cannot find them always in government or in matters
relating to government. I think history is concerned
with what men did and thought, just as much as with
how they are governed; and I do not like any arbi-
trary limitations. Of course a man may say that po-
litical history is the chief thing: it is certainly the
most difficult, and needs most working. Mandell
Creighton, in his Life and Letters (London, 1904,
2 vols.), ii, pp. no f. (October 29, 1894).
32
That the proper subject of history is the develop-
ment of civilization in the widest sense; that all the
various aspects of a civilization have an inner con-
nexion and may be regarded as the manifestations of
a common consciousness; that all civilizations pass
through three well defined stages, which may be
labelled as ancient, mediaeval, and modern; that
parallels may be drawn between the corresponding
stages of two civilizations belonging to very different
epochs; that the later civilization is rarely the off-
spring of the earlier, but rather an independent
growth, a plant developing in virtue of its own in-
herent vitality, which takes nutriment from the past
but transforms whatever it takes — these are con-
clusions with which historians have been familiar for
some time past. The old idea of progress as move-
ment in a straight line has been almost universally
abandoned; so has the idea that politics are the sole
subject-matter of the historian. H. W. C. Davis, in
English Historical Review, April, 1904, p. 322.
33
A historian is of necessity a teacher of morals.
William Garrott Brown, in American Historical Re-
view, October, 1905, p. 184.
34
The great distinction on which M. Xenopol lays
stress is between the sciences which have to do with
facts of repetition and those which deal with facts of
succession. History, like geology, belongs to the lat-
ter kind, and aims at the discovery of causes and the
explanation of series rather than the formulation of
laws or the prediction of recurrent phenomena. It
follows from this principle that he allows far more
scope than most historical theorists to individual
characters and conscious acts, and also to the effects
of chance. A. G., in English Historical Review, Oc-
tober, 1908, p. 812, reviewing A. D. Xenopol's La
Th&orie de I'Histoire (Paris, 1908).
35
Historical thought ... is primarily synthetic in
character: so far as it deals with social realities it
has to treat of complex states and complex processes,
and its main object is to estimate and reflect the
peculiar concentration of various elements in the
shape of individuals, nations, events. In any case it
must pave the way for such estimates by a careful
examination of evidence. And as for the final recon-
struction, it will depend both on reflective compari-
son and deduction, and on artistic intuition. Sir Paul
Vinogradoff, Historical Jurisprudence: Introduction
(London, 1923), pp. 73 f.
36
History is a large subject, because it deals with the
whole life of humanity. It deals with the whole past
in time, from the beginning of historical evidence
down to the present moment, with the whole breadth
in space, for history makes no discrimination between
peoples, though some have, for shorter or longer
periods, a larger place than others. None is always
in the foreground. Furthermore, history covers every
variety of human activity; since it deals with the
whole of the past of humanity, it is as many-sided
as life itself. History is concerned with governments,
war, diplomacy, with the efforts of men to get a liv-
ing, with social organization and activities, and also
with the expression of the human spirit in art, phi-
losophy, and literature. All these are a part of the
general theme of history. For convenience, it is true,
we separate some of these out for special study, since
the history of philosophy can best be explained by
one who knows something of the fundamental prob-
lems of philosophy, and the history of art and of
literature involves some element of artistic and lit-
erary appreciation. We must, however, not forget
that from the point of view of the historian this is
merely a matter of convenience, and that these sev-
eral histories are all parts of a whole which is really
indivisible. C. H. Haskins, "History," in the His-
torical Outlook, May, 1925, p. 195.
37
History, I conceive, may be best denned as man's
effort to record the doings of man. And since men
differ infinitely in their characters, positions, and
opportunities, the records will present the most vary-
ing aspects, ranging from the autolatrous narrative
of his own exploits by an ancient Eastern king, to a
propagandic attempt to represent (or misrepresent)
the whole of the annals of mankind as a logical
process, tending to justify an author's personal
opinions — philosophical, religious, political, or eco-
nomic. . . .
If I have any messages to deliver which are not
mere glimpses of the obvious, they may be summed
up in two phrases. The first is that the writing of
history is a matter for individuals, and that joint-
stock history is a mistake — despite of Lord Acton's
eloquent pleading in its favor. The second is that in
my conception history is a series of interesting hap-
penings, often illogical and cataclysmic, not a logical
and orderly development from causes to inevitable
results.8 In short, history is full of 'might-have-
beens,' and these sometimes deserve as much atten-
tion as the actual, but by no means necessary, course
of events. Sir Charles Oman, On the Writing of His-
tory (London, 1939), pp. v, viii f.
38
It has often been the fashion to censure authors
who are accused of holding that historical writing is
8 This view parallels to some extent that of Goldwin Smith,
Lectures on Modern History (Oxford, 1861), "On the Study of
History," p. 28.
a department of belles-lettres. There may, in some
cases, be a foundation for the charge. To drag in
epigrams and paradoxes, and to wander off into
irrelevant rhapsodies, or picturesque imaginings of
the motives that may have swayed a man or a mob,
is no doubt reprehensible. Not less so, however, is
the fault of crushing out all color, and of treating
events as merely episodes in some process of in-
evitable evolution, and personalities as merely typi-
cal developments of their age or their surroundings.

COTTON MATHER ON HISTORY
Magnolia Christi Americana (London, 1702)
General Introduction, fol. C2
HISTORY, in general, hath had so many and
mighty commendations from the pens of those
numberless authors who, from Herodotus to Howel,1
have been the professed writers of it, that a tenth
part of them transcribed would be a furniture for a
Polyanthea in folio. We, that have neither liberty
nor occasion to quote those commendations of his-
tory, will content ourselves with the opinion of one
who was not much of a professed historian, expressed
in that passage whereto all mankind subscribe,
Historia est testis temporum, nuntia vetustatis, lux
veritatis, vita memoriae, magistra vitae? But of all
history it must be confessed that the palm is to be
given unto church history, wherein the dignity, the
suavity, and the utility of the subject is transcend-
ent. I observe that, for the description of the whole

world in the book of Genesis, that first-born of all
historians, the great Moses, employs but one or two
chapters, whereas he employs it may be seven times
as many chapters in describing that one little pa-
vilion, the Tabernacle. And when I am thinking
what may be the reason of this difference, methinks
it intimates unto us that the church wherein the
service of God is performed is much more precious
than the world, which was indeed created for the
sake and use of the church. 'Tis very certain that
the greatest entertainments must needs occur in the
history of the people whom the Son of God hath re-
deemed and purified unto himself as a peculiar
people, and whom the Spirit of God, by supernatural
operations upon their minds, does cause to live like
strangers in this world, conforming themselves unto
the truths and rules of his holy Word, in expectation
of a kingdom whereto they shall be in another and a
better world advanced. Such a people our Lord Jesus
Christ hath procured and preserved in all ages
visible; and the dispensations of his wondrous Provi-
dence towards this people (for, O Lord, thou dost
lift them up, and cast them down!),3 their calami-
ties, their deliverances, the dispositions which they
have still discovered, and the considerable persons
and actions found among them, cannot but afford
matters of admiration and admonition above what
3 Cf. Psalms, cii, 10.
any other story can pretend to. 'Tis nothing but
atheism in the hearts of men that can persuade them
otherwise. Let any person of good sense peruse the
History of Herodotus, which, like a river taking rise
where the sacred records of the Old Testament leave
off, runs along smoothly and sweetly, with relations
that sometimes perhaps want an apology, down until
the Grecians drive the Persians before them. Let
him then peruse Thucydides, who from acting betook
himself to writing, and carries the ancient state of
the Grecians down to the twenty-first year of the
Peloponnesian War in a manner which Casaubon
judges to be Mirandum potius quant imitandum*
Let him next revolve Xenophon, that Bee of Athens,5
who continues a narrative of the Greek affairs from
the Peloponnesian War to the battle of Mantinea,
and gives us a Cyrus into the bargain, at such a rate
that Lipsius reckons the character of a suavis, fidus,
et circutnspectus scriptor to belong unto him.6 Let
him from hence proceed unto Diodorus Siculus, who,
besides a rich treasure of Egyptian, Assyrian, Libyan,
'"Magnus et vir et scriptor Thucydides: qui a gerendis rebus
ad easdem stilo persequendas quum sese contulisset, historiae ad
usum Politicorum scriptae mortalium, credo, primus exemplum

Arrianus, from Justin, and from Curtius, who in the
relish of Colerus is Quovis melle dulcior.9 Let him
hereupon consult Polybius, and acquaint himself
with the birth and growth of the Roman Empire, as
far as 'tis described in five 10 of the forty books
composed by an author who with a learned professor
of history is Prudens scriptor, si quis alius.11 Let
him now run over the table of the Roman affairs
compendiously given by Lucius Florus, and then let

him consider the transactions of above three hundred
years reported by Dionysius Halicarnasseus, who, if
the censure of Bodin may be taken, Graecos omnes
et Latinos superasse videatur.12 Let him from hence
pass to Livy, of whom the famous critic says, Hoc
solum ingenium (de historicis loquor) populus Ro-
manus par imperio suo habuit,13 and supply those of
his decades that are lost from the best fragments of
antiquity in others (and especially Dion and Sallust)
that lead us on still further in our way. Let him then
proceed unto the writers of the Caesarean14 times,
and first revolve Suetonius, then Tacitus, then He-
rodian, then a whole army more of historians which
now crowd into our library; and unto all the rest let
him not fail of adding the incomparable Plutarch,
whose books, they say, Theodore Gaza preferred
above any in the world,15 next unto the inspired

oracles of the Bible. But if the number be still too
little to satisfy an historical appetite, let him add
Polyhistor 16 unto the number, and all the chronicles
of the following ages. After all, he must sensibly
acknowledge that the two short books of ecclesiastical
history written by the Evangelist Luke have given us
more glorious entertainments than all these volumi-
nous historians if they were all put together. The
achievements of one Paul particularly, which that
Evangelist hath emblazoned, have more true glory
in them than all the acts of those execrable plunderers
and murderers and irresistible banditti of the world
who have been dignified with the name of conquer-
ors. Tacitus counted Ingentia bella, expugnationes

and the glorious violences whereof great warriors
make a wretched ostentation, to be the noblest
matter for an historian. But there is a nobler, I
humbly conceive, in the planting and forming of
Evangelical churches, and the temptations, the cor-
ruptions, the afflictions which assault them, and their
salvations from those assaults, and the exemplary
lives of those that Heaven employs to be patterns of
holiness and usefulness upon earth. And unto such it
is that I now invite my readers; things in comparison
whereof the subjects of many other histories are of as
little weight as the questions about Z, the last letter
of our alphabet, and whether H is to be pronounced
with an aspiration, whereabout whole volumes have
been written, and of no more account than the com-
posures of Didymus.18

the present, and keenness in divining the future.3

live.4 He reckoned it harsh, forsooth, that this celes-
tial animal, on which they have bestowed the name
of man5 because it presents, as it were, a kind of
earthly copy of divine Providence, founds and estab-
lishes cities, wages wars, regulates peace, examines
and considers the diversities of events, and from them
determines what may be of use to itself and others:
that this being should live for one moment, but ever
after abide in the darkness of death, while all its
deeds end and perish with it. There was in his great
and lofty spirit a glowing ardent desire for immor-
tality. This desire took its origin and beginning, not
4 "Itaque Themistoclem, cum annos natus centum et septem
moreretur, cum natura expostulasse accepimus; quod tunc egredi-
endum esset a vita, quando usu longo sapere didicisset." Isaac
Casaubon, preface to his edition of Polybius (1609), p. [3].
"Clarissimus e Graeciae imperatoribus Themistocles, transmissis
vitae annis centum ac septem, lineas iam fieri propiores sentiens,
indoluit: turn sibi demigrandum, sapere quum praecipue esset
exorsus." Lodovicus Caelius Rhodiginus, Antiquae Lectiones, [nova
editio] (Basileae, 1542), i, lib. xxx, cap. ii (p. 1148). I have not
traced the anecdote further back. The nearest analogue that I know
in classical writers is Cicero, De Senectute, 5, 13, where Gorgias of
Leontini is assigned the same age but a different saying: "Nihil
habeo quod accusem senectutem." See other versions of the saying
of Gorgias in H. E. Foss, De Gorgia Leontino Commentatio (Halis
Saxonum, 1828), pp. 37 f. Cotton Mather's reference is marred by
a misprint. Magnolia, bk. ii, p. 20.

divinum animal."
from the perishable body, which, deprived of vital
heat, returns to earth of its own accord, like the
boughs and fruits of trees, but from that graft of the
divine. A man worthy of that immortality to which
he so strongly aspired, he saw that practical wisdom,
the rule and pattern of human life, has its seat upon
a lofty height; that one cannot attain to it except by
certain steps; and that these steps are the deeds of
men. Unless these are preserved, and set forth in
clear light for all to see, necessarily men must ever
live as tiros, and depart from this life in ignorance
of the purposes for which they are born.
Now if some god should grant mortals this privi-
lege, that, before they enter upon the management
of affairs, the government of cities, the administration
of office, they might, in order that they may not make
the wonted complaint of the brevity of life, the
variety of peoples and understandings, their condition
and the incertitude of events, the power of fortune
in human affairs, and other matters, to which men
are hardly able to attain without examples, singly
and once ascend a steep cliff, whence they might
behold and survey the peoples of the whole earth, of
all ages and generations, and their manners and
character, the wars of princes, the laws of the pru-
dent, the situation of countries and cities, all coun-
sels, all actions and their results: truly, gentlemen,
they would think themselves fortunate indeed! Truly

that fretful animal, whom we call man, because in
life itself he ever touches only the fringes of life,8
would for once acquit of blame that Supreme Divin-
ity, whose greatness he does not understand, and
whose kindness he is quick to accuse.
He would be freed from the limits of time and
space. Unhampered by the difficulties of travel, he
would approach everything, he would be present
without danger at all wars and events, he would
gather into one focus the immeasurably great vast-
ness of ages and generations. He would view in a
moment an infinite multitude of matters and affairs.
He would scan the affairs of the Egyptians, which
are considered the most ancient,7 of the Persians,
thought to have been the richest, of the Romans,
justly reckoned to have been the greatest. He would
still behold Themistocles, whom we know to have
been active more than two thousand years ago. The
trophies of Miltiades, which did not allow Themis-
tocles to sleep,8 he would see in their pristine fresh-
ness. He would attend the assemblies of the Atheni-
ans, the deliberations of the Lacedaemonians, the
Roman Senate. To him nothing would be hidden by

time, inaccessible through distance, closed by situa-
tion. The designs, too, and the secrets of empire,
which lie concealed in the minds of kings and princes
as in a hidden shrine, he would gather directly from
the event, exactly like a physician who conducts a
post mortem examination upon the human body. He
would cast his mental eye upon the inner counsels
and arts of war, which the Greeks call stratagems.
This privilege, gentlemen, not to lead you too far
away, is History. History, surest pledge of the kind-
ness of God to man, mother of truth, pattern of life,
preserver of actions, and, as one among the Greeks
says, metropolis of practical wisdom.9 History ren-
ders man contemporary with the universe. She trans-
mits to posterity the likeness, not of the body, but
of the life, the counsels, the soul, and presents it to
the view of all, copied not in bronze or iron, not by
the aid of picture or statue, but in monuments of
letters, by the imperishable resources of facts and
words.
If you have regard to elegance or delightfulness,
you will find there river or spring, here grove or
field, so painted in vivid colors that mother Nature
comes to doubt her right of property, and the charm
of language vies with the innate character and genius
of things. Do you have regard rather to weight or

moral value? There indeed she reigns, there she re-
veals her high nobility. Almost alone, she shows
what it is to be just and fair, what it is to be temper-
ate and liberal, what is the duty of a judge, what of a
senator, what are the qualifications and functions
of a general despatched to war: all much better
shown by examples than by the precepts of a philos-
opher.
Political science belongs wholly to History. The
historian seeks material only from his own field.10
On the other hand, political science, without History,
is tortured and almost wasted away by tasteless, dis-
gusting, and pedantic distinctions and minute divi-
sions of philosophers. Separated also from human
actions, exiled from her home, she is not read in
states, where her kingdom is, but perishes where she
had her birth, in the dust of the schools.
I think, however, that the most important thing is
the fellowship which History has with our mind and
soul. These she so nourishes and influences that she
seems to claim them for herself and to possess them
almost in entirety. The reason of this must be sought
from the very nature and origin of the soul. We see
children, when first they begin to understand, listen
so eagerly to little stories that sometimes they do not
even have time to cry. Philosophers too, as Aristotle
notes in the first book of the Metaphysics, enjoy
10 "Assisted by no strengths but are her owne." Infra, p. 34.
stories for the same reason.11 Moreover, as the indi-
vidual stars are said by the Peripatetics to be moved
with their world, so our mind, when she listens to
narratives, not only is forgetful of herself, but seems
to wander away from herself, as it were, and to de-
part, and to be attached to the things narrated, and
not so much to read the particulars as to act them,
which, sirs, is an incredible and almost inexpressible
pleasure and happiness. If she is occupied with
Roman history, she swims with Cocles,12 ploughs
with Quinctius,13 delays with Fabius;14 with Marcel-
lus she attacks the Carthaginian,15 with Nero, Has-
drubal.16 If in Greek history, she goes to battle with
Themistocles at sea,17 with Lysander on land,18 she
flees with Aristides,19 she is imprisoned with Cimon.20
If we must speak of the value of History, I should
hope, sirs, yes, I should earnestly hope, that they

who, to the extent of their ability, try to bring letters
and these humane studies into contempt, would either
acquit all equally, or condemn History equally with
them. I trust that this will not annoy them. I hope
that they will grant it willingly.
They who are versed in the majestic and austere
science of the law rightly exalt it, but they unjustly
disparage other sciences, or consider them unworthy
of a man of weight. Of them we do not ask that they
appraise History in the light of the dependence upon
it of Jurisprudence herself. We are not beggars,21 we
demand only our own. But we do ask that they look
to their laws to the best of their ability, leaving His-
tory to us and to princes. With pride we say it: If
History have no professorship, if all universities be
closed, she will always have a hospitable reception in
palaces and in the innermost chambers of kings and
princes. She is the inseparable companion of their
minds, their counsels, and their deeds. In camps,
amid trumpets and the clash of arms, as witness
Scipio,22 where laws, as the proverb tells us, must be
silent,23 she will find place. For I must make it clear
that the exposition of History made for the benefit
of kings and princes is not the same as that which we
make to you. For you, we must sometimes stick

closely to details, we must continually examine an-
tiquities, we must sometimes cite parallel passages of
authors. But he who would undertake before kings
and princes the exposition of a great historian, such
as, e.g., Polybius or Livy, would certainly resolve
upon a quite different system. He would take all
civil and military knowledge as his province. He
would treat of the education and training of a prince,
of the best order and manner of ruling, of the func-
tion and office of an ambassador. On this there was
a whole section, a great part of which has survived,
in the Pandects of Porphyrogenitus, which the great
emperor, imitating Justinian, compiled from the his-
torians.24 He would treat of the storming of walls
and the establishment of posts. He would teach the
time for assaults and the time for luring forth the
enemy. He would discuss standards, ambuscades,
guards of the gates, the arrangement of the watches.
He would discuss the ordering of the battle-array,
movement in order of battle; he would explain the
nature of the double and of the triple line. If it were
24 The reference is to the great encyclopaedia of history and
political science prepared at the command of the Eastern Emperor
Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (912-959). In this work selec-
tions from Greek and Byzantine historians were arranged in fifty-
three sections, classified by subjects. Much has been lost. The
twenty-seventh section, on embassies, was edited by Fulvius
Ursinus, Selecta de Legationibus (Antverpiae, 1582), containing
selections mostly from Polybius, and by David Hoeschel, Eclogae
Legationum (Augustae Vindelicorum, 1603).
his purpose to give a comparative view of ancient
and modern warfare, he would describe accurately
all machines, catapults, rams, ballistae, scorpions,
movable bridges, fascines, mantlets, pent-houses, and
other things of that sort, and would compare with
these our systems of siege warfare.
If we do not handle these matters with elabora-
tion, if we teach some things which are of less weight,
this does not take away from the dignity of History,
as I believe, but is our contribution to your advan-
tage and profit. Precedent requires that our field be
given this extension. Again, although all History is
magnificent, illustrious, broad, and therefore pleas-
ing, yet beyond other things the splendor of the
Roman people and the majesty peculiar to that race,
whereof Greeklings have never even uttered the
name, awaken and captivate us to a great degree, so
that they seem to have passed over from the empire
itself and the invincible city to its authors, especially
the historians. Manifestly the immortal gods could
not endure that the splendor of the Roman people
should perish. Virtue and Fortune alike had prom-
ised eternity to that splendor. Arisen from certain
fables and absurdities almost poetic, it was to mount
above all the greatness of all kingdoms and empires.
Who, indeed, is so utterly listless, who lives so in-
active and slothful, as not to be roused by the mere
name and memory of that city, which with universal
consent is called by the ancients sum and substance
of the world, the world's miracle? Again: Whose
mind is not fed, aye, to repletion, who reads of Ca-
milli, Fabii, Fabricii, Nasicas, Scipios, Curios, names
not so much of men as of virtues? Who is not stimu-
lated and filled with boundless delight, when he hath
withdrawn himself unto that nation from which we
have received the power and patterns of virtue, not,
as in the writings of the Greeks, by discussion, but
described and delineated by very life and deeds? Its
language is almost vernacular with us; we all use its
laws and justice; its relics on rocks and stones we
wellnigh worship. Indeed, sirs, I do not deny that I
am returning as it were into my home country from
the long journey which I have made during the past
several years through almost all Greece.25 And just
Heinsius's first appointment in the University of Leyden was
in 1602, while he was yet a student, to teach poetry, i.e., Greek
and Latin poetry. Bronnen tot it Geschiedenis der Leidsche Uni-
versiteit, ed. P. C. Molhuysen, i, 1574-1610 (the Hague, 1913),

at 700 florins per annum. Ibid., p. 159. February 8, 9, 10, 1609, it
was voted that in the absence of Bonaventura Vulcanius he was to
be regarded as professor ordinarius of the same subject. Ibid.,

as Homer's Ulysses, when he sees that he has reached
Ithaca, embraces the sod, salutes the Nymphs, and
venerates with particular joy and delight the places
he had so often longed for:26 so is it with me, when
I behold this city, and see myself brought anew to
all those things which as a youth I contemplated
diligently of yore. And indeed I deem that I have
entered the Roman state not as a sojourner, but as a
citizen by right of recovery.27 No outlaw was I,
gentlemen, nor did I lose meanwhile full Roman
rights and citizenship, but I dwelt in Greece for the
sake of understanding and learning, and to survey
all sciences. Now — may the event be happy! —I
behold Rome with eager eyes, even as those Romans
who returned into their native land from Athens,
after they had betaken themselves thither for their
studies.28 I must say,

the beginnings. This, gentlemen, ye shall do with me
in Lucius Annaeus Florus. Indeed, who will not
wonder that the one hut of Romulus hath brought
forth so many temples, so many buildings, so many
structures, excelling the condition of man? Who is
not stricken with amazement when he considers and
reads that the founders of universal empire, neg-
lected by men, were preserved by a wild beast?30
Who does not rejoice to believe that Father Tiber
held back the stream when they were there cast
away?31 As the origin of Rome seems to have over-
stepped the bounds of nature, afterwards its splendor
and power surpassed the limits of the whole earth.
When we see a man endowed with unusual excel-
lence, who by arms or understanding hath achieved
a renowned and famous name, we seek with a kind
of delight for complete knowledge of his infancy and
childish toys. In the same way, he who admires the
imperial dignity of Rome is somehow more delighted
by her beginnings. So that it is with incredible zeal
that he hears and reads of Evanders,32 too, of Fauni,33
Faustuli,34 and Accas.35 This way we also shall
tread. We shall proceed from the earliest childhood

of the mistress of the world to the fulness and ripe-
ness of her age. We shall come down from shepherds
to kings, from kings to liberty, from liberty to those
times in which the greatness of vices balanced the
greatness of empire and destroyed it as well. Not
only men shall we see, but also clans, the Valerian,
Postumian, Papirian, Quinctian, and preeminently
the Fabian, Curian, Fabrician. These seem to me
fallen from heaven with their shields,36 or born and
reared of Virtue herself. Next we shall view the Civil
Wars, and ambition, most powerful of all evils:
which, first arisen between brothers, soon comes to
others. As in a picture, we shall behold the life of
the Roman people, its manners, efforts, but especially
its wars and battles. These our Florus has minuted
with care, so far as his concise brevity permitted.
Sometimes ye have heard Dominicus Baudius ex-
pound him from this place: a man quite comparable
with antiquity, and of memory so strong, as to carry
about, as if in a capacious purse, all histories and
all annals, modern and ancient. To me, indeed, he
left nothing except his love strong beyond belief,
which he committed to me at his dying hour, and
this position, so that my very incapacity might re-
sult to his praise and reputation. For his part, he
used to seek from History all his glory, praise, and
"See Livy, i, 20, 4, "caelestia arma, quae ancilia appellantur,"

reputation, as well in lectures as in writing. In her
he lives, in her he speaks with us, in her he survives,
in her we have his genius and pleasantry, in her we
seem to look upon him face to face. Through her,
finally, he procured honor for his country, for him-
self life after death. O divine power and dignity of
letters! O preserver of men, preserver of men's
deeds, preserver of chronology, preserver of all the
centuries, of all years and generations the preserver,
History! In thee Greece applies herself to philoso-
phy, in thee Rome still rules, in thee likewise she
waxes and flowers, begins and ends: Brutus over-
throws the kingdom, Romulus founds it: Cocles
plucks out the bridge, Mucius burns his hand:
Cloelia swims, Lucretia is outraged. Hannibal lays
waste Italy, Scipio, Carthage: Crassus is slain among
the Parthians, Pompey in Egypt, Caesar in the Sen-
ate Chamber by the armed citizens, Cato gives his
life for liberty. Through thee whatever has been, is,
while whatever is, never ceases to be. Through thee
the people has its customs, the soothsayers their
sacred rites, the magistrates their badges of office.
Through thee the city has its regions, aqueducts,
blocks, and streets; only in thee it has its walls and
boundaries. The very patron deities also, and mother
Vesta, and the eternal fires, and Tarpeian Jupiter,
and the Seven Hills, are never seen except in History.
To the hundred and seven years of Themistocles,

who complained that he had lived so short a time,
thou hast added all eternity. Again: Thou hast made
Alexander the Great, whose life was quenched by
the envy of the Fates within his thirty-third year,
still survive with the world over which he triumphed.
Go, now, Kings and Princes, go, and put your
trophies elsewhere than in the eternity of letters.
Believe that some rock or stone can avail against
the long continuance of time. Poets, orators, and
especialy historians, the peculiar ministers of the
Muses, and priests of eternity, heralds also of your
glory and name — neglect these, if ye see fit, and
in their places load with benefits a monkey or a fool.
The very empress of nations is now nowhere except
in History. Lady and princess of the whole world,
she beholds her majesty nowhere save in letters.
When, again, we see that so many statues have
perished there, so many arches, temples, porticos,
basilicas, tombs, courts, columns, in hope of eternity
consecrated within or without the city by the rulers
of the world: that even those wrought in adamant,
if such there were, are now gone (adamant, which
they call hardest of metals, and in which, the poets
declare, the destined decrees of the Fates were cut
because of its extreme rigidity): what then shall I
conclude, except that rocks, iron, lead, and brass, aye,
the very arts to which they turn for preservation,
lie prostrate beneath the power and majesty of the
human understanding? Or, indeed, if any one of you
has examined History, he can not be ignorant of the
Theatre of Pompey.37 Here is a case where, it seems
to me, a number of princes, Giant-fashion, have
measured their strength with time. Pompey, for-
sooth, had built it to last. It was wasted and de-
stroyed. Tiberius restored it. Caligula completed it.
Burned a second time, Claudius rebuilt it. Next it
was ruined by age, and Theodoric built it again.
Where is it now, gentlemen? It would have faded
even from remembrance, had History permitted.
They say that Cnaeus Octavius 38 gave his exploits
to workmen to be depicted with the utmost care on a
vast portico, which, from the produce of spoil, he
built as if to last forever. Where do you find any
traces of it, except in literature? We see that noth-
ing has escaped from such great ruins, nothing from
the hands of the Goths and the furies of the Vandals,
nothing from the shipwreck of fortune, the long con-
tinuance of time, and the storm of war, except only
the monuments of mind and intellect. Nay also, we
see that in agriculture and architecture all the con-

temporary works of man 39 shall perish, unless we
historians claim them as our own. Moreover we
perceive that of this brief and perishing life by far
the greatest part, our fame and reputation, looks
toward posterity. Therefore, sirs, let us take a nobler,
loftier courage. Let us cherish this brief time, this
moment, which God hath prepared for the cultiva-
tion of this great trust, History. In her reside for us
and for almost all created things glory, memory, and
dignity, and finally the destined keystone of eternity
itself. So in surpassing the law of our mortality
under the will and favor of God immortal, who hath
given us the means of perpetuity, we may seem to
have conferred life and eternity upon all others.
This must be looked for from History almost alone.
Gentlemen, I return to you my heartiest thanks,
that ye have listened thus far to my remarks on the
value of History. But especially I thank thee, most

over the praise of History, it might have been neces-
sary that I urge all to pursue and embrace the study
of her. For men have no readier means of correcting
their knowledge of the past. But since not some, nor
a part, but practically all, have begun and ended in
developing this theme: affirming that the study of
History is the truest education and training for
public affairs; and that the most instructive, indeed
the only method of learning to endure nobly the
vicissitudes of fortune is to recall the reverses of

is a good thing to be able to make use of the mistakes
of others as examples for avoidance, and in the
events of life not to have to seek expedients, but
rather to imitate precedents. And surely all prefer
old men to young men in counsel, because of the ex-
perience which time has given them. But the knowl-
edge derived from History surpasses the experience
of old men as much as we know it excels it in multi-
tude of examples. Accordingly one might consider
History a most profitable coadjutor for all the occa-
sions of life. For it preserves for young men the
sagacity of the old, while for the old it multiplies
many times the knowledge they have acquired. It
prepares private citizens for posts of command. It
impels princes to attempt the most honorable deeds
for a glorious immortality. Furthermore, it makes
soldiers, in the hope of commendation after death,
more ready to meet peril for their country, while by
the fear of eternal reprobation it dissuades wicked
men from the impulse to evil. Diodorus Siculus,

the figure of History is a temple inscribed The History of the
World. On the roof, a world apart, are Fama bona and Fama mala,
winged figures with trumpets, the latter covered with spots. At
the right of History is Experientia, with measuring wand and plumb

have flourished and fallen, and for what vertue and
piety God made prosperous, and for what vice and
deformity he made wretched, both the one and the
other. And it is not the least debt which we owe
unto History that it hath made us acquainted with
our dead Ancestors, and out of the depth and darke-

Your lordship may . . . ask me, what then is the
true use of history? in what respects it may serve to
make us better and wiser? and what method is to be
pursued in the study of it, for attaining these great
ends? I will answer you by quoting what I have read
somewhere or other, in Dionysius Halicarn, I think,
that history is philosophy teaching by examples. We
need but to cast our eyes on the world, and we shall

see the daily force of example: we need but to turn
them inward, and we shall soon see why example
has this force. "Pauci prudentia," says Tacitus,

History, at least in its state of ideal perfection, is
a compound of poetry and philosophy. It impresses
general truths on the mind by a vivid representation
of particular characters and incidents. But, in fact,
the two hostile elements of which it consists have
never been known to form a perfect amalgamation.
T. B. Macaulay, "Hallam" (1828), in his Critical
and Historical Essays (London, 1843, 3 vols.), i,
p. 113.
22
The perfect historian is he in whose work the
character and spirit of an age is exhibited in minia-
ture. He relates no fact, he attributes no expression
to his characters, which is not authenticated by suf-
ficient testimony. But by judicious selection, rejec-
tion, and arrangement, he gives to truth those attrac-
tions which have been usurped by fiction. In his
narrative a due subordination is observed; some
transactions are prominent, others retire. But the
scale on which he represents them is increased or
diminished, not according to the dignity of the per-
sons concerned in them, but according to the degree
in which they elucidate the condition of society and
the nature of man. He shows us the court, the camp,
and the senate. But he shows us also the nation. He
considers no anecdote, no peculiarity of manner, no
familiar saying, as too insignificant for his notice,
which is not too insignificant to illustrate the oper-
ation of laws, of religion, and of education, and to
mark the progress of the human mind. Men will not
merely be described, but will be made intimately
known to us. The changes of manners will be indi-
cated, not merely by a few general phrases, or a few
extracts from statistical documents, but by appropri-
ate images presented in every line.
If a man, such as we are supposing, should write
the history of England, he would assuredly not omit
the battles, the sieges, the negotiations, the seditions,
the ministerial changes. But with these he would
intersperse the details which are the charm of his-
torical romances. At Lincoln Cathedral there is a
beautiful painted window, which was made by an
apprentice out of the pieces of glass which had been
rejected by his master. It is so far superior to every
other in the church, that, according to the tradition,
the vanquished artist killed himself from mortifica-
tion. Sir Walter Scott, in the same manner, has used
those fragments of truth which historians have scorn-
fully thrown behind them, in a manner which may
well excite their envy. He has constructed out of
their gleanings works which, even considered as his-
tories, are scarcely less valuable than theirs. But a
truly great historian would reclaim those materials
which the novelist has appropriated. The history of
the government, and the history of the people, would
be exhibited in that mode in which alone they can be
exhibited justly, in inseparable conjunction and inter-
mixture. We should not then have to look for the
wars and votes of the Puritans in Clarendon, and for
their phraseology in Old Mortality; for one half of
King James in Hume, and for the other half in the
Fortunes of Nigel. Idem, "History," in The Edin-
burgh Review, May, 1828, pp. 364 f.
23
These historical novels have taught all men this
truth, which looks like a truism, and yet was as good
as unknown to writers of history and others, till so
taught: that the bygone ages of the world were actu-
ally filled by living men, not by protocols, state-
papers, controversies, and abstractions of men. Not
abstractions were they, not diagrams and theorems;
but men, in buff or other coats and breeches, with
color in their cheeks, with passions in their stomach,
and the idioms, features, and vitalities of very men.
It is a little word this; inclusive of great meaning!
History will henceforth have to take thought of it.
Her faint hearsays of 'philosophy teaching by ex-
perience' will have to exchange themselves every-
where for direct inspection and imbodiment: this,
and this only, will be counted experience; and till
once experience have got in, philosophy will recon-
cile herself to wait at the door. Thomas Carlyle, re-
view of J. G. Lockhart's Life of Sir Walter Scott, in
The London and Westminster Review, January,
1838, pp. 337 f.
24
Above all things, the historian must get out of his
own age into the time in which he is writing. Imagi-
nation is as much needed for the historian as the
poet. You may combine bits of books with other
bits of books, and so make some new combinations,
and this may be done accurately; and, in general,
much of the subordinate preparation for history may
be accomplished without any great effort of imagina-
tion. But to write history, in any large sense of the
words, you must be able to comprehend other times.
You must know that there is a right and wrong which
is not your right and wrong, but yet stands upon the
right and wrong of all ages and all hearts. You must
also appreciate the outward life and colors of the
period you write about. Try to think how the men
you are telling of would have spent a day, what were
their leading ideas: what they cared about. Grasp
the body of the time, and give it to us. If not, and
these men could look at your history, they would
say, "This is all very well; we dare say some of these
things did happen; but we were not thinking of these
things all day long. It does not represent us."
After enlarging upon this great requisite, imagina-
tion, it seems somewhat prosaic to come down to
saying that history requires accuracy. But I think
I hear the sighs, and sounds more harsh than sigh-
ing, of those who have ever investigated any thing,
and found by dire experience the deplorable inac-
curacy which prevails in the world. And, therefore,
I would say to the historian almost as the first sug-
gestion, "Be accurate; do not make false references,
do not mis-state: and men, if they get no light from
you, will not execrate you. You will not stand in the
way and have to be explained and got rid of." Arthur
Helps, Friends in Council, book the first (London,
1848), pp. 214 f.

The true subjective history of man is the history
not of his thought, but of his conscience; the true
objective history of man is not that of his inventions,
but of his vices and his virtues. Charles Kingsley,

26
We shall find, as I believe, in all the ages, God
educating man; protecting him till he can go alone,
furnishing him with the primary necessaries, teach-
ing him, guiding him, inspiring him, as we should do
to our children; bearing with him, and forgiving him
too, again and again, as we should do: but teaching
him withal (as we shall do if we be wise) in great
part by his own experience, making him test for him-
self, even by failure and pain, the truth of the laws
which have been given him; discover for himself, as
much as possible, fresh laws, or fresh applications
of laws; and exercising his will and faculties, by
trusting him to himself wherever he can be trusted
without his final destruction. This is my conception
of history. Ibid., p. 62.
27
I consider . . . that history has to do with the
state, that it investigates the growth and changes of
a certain corporate society, which acts through cer-
tain functionaries and certain assemblies. By the
nature of the state every person who lives in a certain
territory is usually a member of it, but history is not
concerned with individuals except in their capacity
of members of a state. That a man in England makes
a scientific discovery or paints a picture, is not in
itself an event in the history of England. J. R. Seeley,
The Expansion of England (London, 1883), pp. 6 f.
28
If I were called on to do so, I should be most in-
clined to give some such definition as this; to say that
history is the science of man in his character as a
political being. E. A. Freeman, Methods of Histo-
rical Study (London, 1886), p. 117.
29
Two views prevail concerning the scope of history.
One regards it, to use the expression of an eminent
living writer, as being concerned solely with states,
so that (in the words of another distinguished con-
temporary) "history is past politics, and politics is
present history." 7 The other, which has found illus-
trious exponents from Herodotus downwards, con-
ceives it to be a picture of the whole past, including
everything that man has either thought or wrought.
Of these views the former appears to us narrow, and
therefore misleading; the latter so wide as to become
vague, fixing no definite limit to the province of his-
tory as bordering on other fields of learning. It seems
better to regard history as the record of human
action, and of thought only in its direct influence
upon action. James Bryce, in English Historical Re-
view, January, 1886, prefatory note.

I do not know that history can be limited to poli-
tics. The Greek word icrropia means inquiry, and
history is properly any inquiry into the past. Of
course our curiosity is about different things at dif-
ferent times. But we want to find in any period what S
was most important in it: and we want also to bring
it into some relation to ourselves at present. Politics,
1 suppose, means the organization of society by the
state: but we often want to know more than that;
literature, art, ideas, religion, all have their place,
and some periods are entirely engaged with them.
Of course all these things pass into society, but we
cannot find them always in government or in matters
relating to government. I think history is concerned
with what men did and thought, just as much as with
how they are governed; and I do not like any arbi-
trary limitations. Of course a man may say that po-
litical history is the chief thing: it is certainly the
most difficult, and needs most working. Mandell
Creighton, in his Life and Letters (London, 1904,
2 vols.), ii, pp. no f. (October 29, 1894).
32
That the proper subject of history is the develop-
ment of civilization in the widest sense; that all the
various aspects of a civilization have an inner con-
nexion and may be regarded as the manifestations of
a common consciousness; that all civilizations pass
through three well defined stages, which may be
labelled as ancient, mediaeval, and modern; that
parallels may be drawn between the corresponding
stages of two civilizations belonging to very different
epochs; that the later civilization is rarely the off-
spring of the earlier, but rather an independent
growth, a plant developing in virtue of its own in-
herent vitality, which takes nutriment from the past
but transforms whatever it takes — these are con-
clusions with which historians have been familiar for
some time past. The old idea of progress as move-
ment in a straight line has been almost universally
abandoned; so has the idea that politics are the sole
subject-matter of the historian. H. W. C. Davis, in
English Historical Review, April, 1904, p. 322.

The great distinction on which M. Xenopol lays
stress is between the sciences which have to do with
facts of repetition and those which deal with facts of
succession. History, like geology, belongs to the lat-
ter kind, and aims at the discovery of causes and the
explanation of series rather than the formulation of
laws or the prediction of recurrent phenomena. It
follows from this principle that he allows far more
scope than most historical theorists to individual
characters and conscious acts, and also to the effects
of chance. A. G., in English Historical Review, Oc-
tober, 1908, p. 812, reviewing A. D. Xenopol's La
Th&orie de I'Histoire (Paris, 1908).
35
Historical thought ... is primarily synthetic in
character: so far as it deals with social realities it
has to treat of complex states and complex processes,
and its main object is to estimate and reflect the
peculiar concentration of various elements in the
shape of individuals, nations, events. In any case it
must pave the way for such estimates by a careful
examination of evidence. And as for the final recon-
struction, it will depend both on reflective compari-
son and deduction, and on artistic intuition. Sir Paul
Vinogradoff, Historical Jurisprudence: Introduction
(London, 1923), pp. 73 f.
36
History is a large subject, because it deals with the
whole life of humanity. It deals with the whole past
in time, from the beginning of historical evidence
down to the present moment, with the whole breadth
in space, for history makes no discrimination between
peoples, though some have, for shorter or longer
periods, a larger place than others. None is always
in the foreground. Furthermore, history covers every
variety of human activity; since it deals with the
whole of the past of humanity, it is as many-sided
as life itself. History is concerned with governments,
war, diplomacy, with the efforts of men to get a liv-
ing, with social organization and activities, and also
with the expression of the human spirit in art, phi-
losophy, and literature. All these are a part of the
general theme of history. For convenience, it is true,
we separate some of these out for special study, since
the history of philosophy can best be explained by
one who knows something of the fundamental prob-
lems of philosophy, and the history of art and of
literature involves some element of artistic and lit-
erary appreciation. We must, however, not forget
that from the point of view of the historian this is
merely a matter of convenience, and that these sev-
eral histories are all parts of a whole which is really
indivisible. C. H. Haskins, "History," in the His-
torical Outlook, May, 1925, p. 195.
37
History, I conceive, may be best denned as man's
effort to record the doings of man. And since men
differ infinitely in their characters, positions, and
opportunities, the records will present the most vary-
ing aspects, ranging from the autolatrous narrative
of his own exploits by an ancient Eastern king, to a
propagandic attempt to represent (or misrepresent)
the whole of the annals of mankind as a logical
process, tending to justify an author's personal
opinions — philosophical, religious, political, or eco-
nomic. . . .
If I have any messages to deliver which are not
mere glimpses of the obvious, they may be summed
up in two phrases. The first is that the writing of
history is a matter for individuals, and that joint-
stock history is a mistake — despite of Lord Acton's
eloquent pleading in its favor. The second is that in
my conception history is a series of interesting hap-
penings, often illogical and cataclysmic, not a logical
and orderly development from causes to inevitable
results.8 In short, history is full of 'might-have-
beens,' and these sometimes deserve as much atten-
tion as the actual, but by no means necessary, course
of events. Sir Charles Oman, On the Writing of His-
tory (London, 1939), pp. v, viii f.
38
It has often been the fashion to censure authors
who are accused of holding that historical writing is
8 This view parallels to some extent that of Goldwin Smith,
Lectures on Modern History (Oxford, 1861), "On the Study of
History," p. 28.
a department of belles-lettres. There may, in some
cases, be a foundation for the charge. To drag in
epigrams and paradoxes, and to wander off into
irrelevant rhapsodies, or picturesque imaginings of
the motives that may have swayed a man or a mob,
is no doubt reprehensible. Not less so, however, is
the fault of crushing out all color, and of treating
events as merely episodes in some process of in-
evitable evolution, and personalities as merely typi-
cal developments of their age or their surroundings.

General Introduction, fol. C2
HISTORY, in general, hath had so many and
mighty commendations from the pens of those
numberless authors who, from Herodotus to Howel,1
have been the professed writers of it, that a tenth
part of them transcribed would be a furniture for a
Polyanthea in folio. We, that have neither liberty
nor occasion to quote those commendations of his-
tory, will content ourselves with the opinion of one
who was not much of a professed historian, expressed
in that passage whereto all mankind subscribe,
Historia est testis temporum, nuntia vetustatis, lux
veritatis, vita memoriae, magistra vitae? But of all
history it must be confessed that the palm is to be
given unto church history, wherein the dignity, the
suavity, and the utility of the subject is transcend-
ent. I observe that, for the description of the whole

world in the book of Genesis, that first-born of all
historians, the great Moses, employs but one or two
chapters, whereas he employs it may be seven times
as many chapters in describing that one little pa-
vilion, the Tabernacle. And when I am thinking
what may be the reason of this difference, methinks
it intimates unto us that the church wherein the
service of God is performed is much more precious
than the world, which was indeed created for the
sake and use of the church. 'Tis very certain that
the greatest entertainments must needs occur in the
history of the people whom the Son of God hath re-
deemed and purified unto himself as a peculiar
people, and whom the Spirit of God, by supernatural
operations upon their minds, does cause to live like
strangers in this world, conforming themselves unto
the truths and rules of his holy Word, in expectation
of a kingdom whereto they shall be in another and a
better world advanced. Such a people our Lord Jesus
Christ hath procured and preserved in all ages
visible; and the dispensations of his wondrous Provi-
dence towards this people (for, O Lord, thou dost
lift them up, and cast them down!),3 their calami-
ties, their deliverances, the dispositions which they
have still discovered, and the considerable persons
and actions found among them, cannot but afford
matters of admiration and admonition above what
3 Cf. Psalms, cii, 10.
any other story can pretend to. 'Tis nothing but
atheism in the hearts of men that can persuade them
otherwise. Let any person of good sense peruse the
History of Herodotus, which, like a river taking rise
where the sacred records of the Old Testament leave
off, runs along smoothly and sweetly, with relations
that sometimes perhaps want an apology, down until
the Grecians drive the Persians before them. Let
him then peruse Thucydides, who from acting betook
himself to writing, and carries the ancient state of
the Grecians down to the twenty-first year of the
Peloponnesian War in a manner which Casaubon
judges to be Mirandum potius quant imitandum*
Let him next revolve Xenophon, that Bee of Athens,5
who continues a narrative of the Greek affairs from
the Peloponnesian War to the battle of Mantinea,
and gives us a Cyrus into the bargain, at such a rate
that Lipsius reckons the character of a suavis, fidus,
et circutnspectus scriptor to belong unto him.6 Let
him from hence proceed unto Diodorus Siculus, who,
besides a rich treasure of Egyptian, Assyrian, Libyan,
'"Magnus et vir et scriptor Thucydides: qui a gerendis rebus
ad easdem stilo persequendas quum sese contulisset, historiae ad

Arrianus, from Justin, and from Curtius, who in the
relish of Colerus is Quovis melle dulcior.9 Let him
hereupon consult Polybius, and acquaint himself
with the birth and growth of the Roman Empire, as
far as 'tis described in five 10 of the forty books
composed by an author who with a learned professor
of history is Prudens scriptor, si quis alius.11 Let
him now run over the table of the Roman affairs
compendiously given by Lucius Florus, and then let

him consider the transactions of above three hundred
years reported by Dionysius Halicarnasseus, who, if
the censure of Bodin may be taken, Graecos omnes
et Latinos superasse videatur.12 Let him from hence
pass to Livy, of whom the famous critic says, Hoc
solum ingenium (de historicis loquor) populus Ro-
manus par imperio suo habuit,13 and supply those of
his decades that are lost from the best fragments of
antiquity in others (and especially Dion and Sallust)
that lead us on still further in our way. Let him then
proceed unto the writers of the Caesarean14 times,
and first revolve Suetonius, then Tacitus, then He-
rodian, then a whole army more of historians which
now crowd into our library; and unto all the rest let
him not fail of adding the incomparable Plutarch,
whose books, they say, Theodore Gaza preferred
above any in the world,15 next unto the inspired

omnes libri perdendi essent, et ipsi optio daretur, quern servatum
oracles of the Bible. But if the number be still too
little to satisfy an historical appetite, let him add
Polyhistor 16 unto the number, and all the chronicles
of the following ages. After all, he must sensibly
acknowledge that the two short books of ecclesiastical
history written by the Evangelist Luke have given us
more glorious entertainments than all these volumi-
nous historians if they were all put together. The
achievements of one Paul particularly, which that
Evangelist hath emblazoned, have more true glory
in them than all the acts of those execrable plunderers
and murderers and irresistible banditti of the world
who have been dignified with the name of conquer-
ors. Tacitus counted Ingentia bella, expugnationes

and the glorious violences whereof great warriors
make a wretched ostentation, to be the noblest
matter for an historian. But there is a nobler, I
humbly conceive, in the planting and forming of
Evangelical churches, and the temptations, the cor-
ruptions, the afflictions which assault them, and their
salvations from those assaults, and the exemplary
lives of those that Heaven employs to be patterns of
holiness and usefulness upon earth. And unto such it
is that I now invite my readers; things in comparison
whereof the subjects of many other histories are of as
little weight as the questions about Z, the last letter
of our alphabet, and whether H is to be pronounced
with an aspiration, whereabout whole volumes have
been written, and of no more account than the com-
posures of Didymus.18
